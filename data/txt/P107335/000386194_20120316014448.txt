F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The program development objectives were to: (i) preserve fiscal space for poverty
reduction; (ii) promote efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public
resources; and (iii) improve the investment climate and promote exports.


Revised Program Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

by the rental of emergency electricity generators to state, “improve the investment
climate through provision of electricity in a fiscally sustainable manner.?

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Background

The Governance Reform and Growth (GRG) operations supported Sierra Leone’s
transition from post-conflict recovery to a major drive for poverty reduction. By
2006, when the Bank appraised the first GRG operation1, the country had successfully
restored peace and security following a decade of armed civil conflict that had resulted in
more than 50,000 deaths, displaced one-third of the country’s population, and destroyed
much of the nation’s infrastructure. Prior to the GRG operations, the Bank had financed
four policy-based operations supporting the post-conflict recovery process through Sierra
Leone’s National Recovery and Rehabilitation Program.

Notably the GRG series of operations came to be designed and implemented during
an unexpectedly challenging and uncertain period for Sierra Leone. Economic
prospects were adversely affected by a weakening of international commodity prices,
especially for diamonds, the principal export, and other minerals which are the principal
foreign exchange earners for the country. Deferred and delayed investments in the
minerals sector aggravated the situation and coincided with declines in remittance income.
Exchange rate pressures emerged which were compounded by inflationary pressure due
to rapidly rising prices of key imports including food and fuel. This in turn placed
considerable pressure on the fiscal position.

Sierra Leone looked to high economic growth to achieve the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). In 2006, Sierra Leone ranked near the bottom of the
Human Development Index, with about 70 percent of Sierra Leone’s total population of
5.5 million living below the national poverty line, defined at Le 2,111 (less than US$1)
per day. The Government’s overarching MDG was to reduce this share to 40 percent by
2015. The Government’s First Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), prepared in
2005, had indicated that in order to meet this MDG by 2015, the economy would have to
grow by about 8-9 percent annually from about 7.4 percent in 2004.

In addition to higher economic growth, poverty reduction required better public
financial management focused on priority “pro-poor? expenditures. Government

  In this report, GRG refers to the series of three growth and reform operations and a supplemental credit for the third
operation, which took place between 2006 and 2011. The first operation, referred to as GRGG-1 was a grant. The
second and third governance reform and growth operations were credits, the Second Governance Reform and Growth
Credit (GRGC-2) and the Third Governance Reform and Growth Credit (GRGC-3), including the supplemental credit
for the GRGC-3.




                                                          21
capacity to protect these expenditures had weakened, according to a review of public
expenditures between 2001 and 2004. The weighted average of the absolute deviation
between actual and planned spending was high, having increased from 12 percent in 2001
to 16 percent in 2004. Most of the variance had resulted from under-spending due to
shortfalls in external budget support. In contrast, spending in other categories was
consistently over budget. The inability to meet expenditure targets threatened to impede
progress in poverty reduction.

Economic growth estimates referenced in GRG operations were lower than in the
PRSP and declined substantially between the first and third operation. When the
Bank appraised GRGG-1, average real GDP growth rate was forecast to start out at 7.4
percent in 2006 and gradually taper off to 6.1 percent by 2008. This rate, though strong
by international standards, was far below what the PRSP had determined necessary to
meet the MDGs. And prospects worsened due to the global economic recession. By the
time of the appraisal of the Supplemental Credit for the GRGC-3 in early 2010, economic
growth had declined to 5.5 percent in 2008 and plummeted further to 3.2 percent in 2009.
Nevertheless, Sierra Leone was, by and large, able to meet its obligations with respect to
policies and targets agreed to under an arrangement with the IMF through its Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), designed to maintain macroeconomic stability.2

At the outset of GRGC-3, shortfalls in domestic revenue and delays in the
disbursement of budget support had begun to challenge fiscal policy. As a result, the
fiscal outcome in 2008 had departed from an improving trend, with the growing negative
balance reaching -4.8 percent of GDP compared to -2.7 percent in 2006. The decline had
resulted from lower economic growth and diminished collection of import duties, excise
taxes, mining taxes, and non-tax revenues. Also, only 71 percent of programmed budget
support was disbursed in 2008 (a shortfall of 1.8 percent of GDP) due to delays in
meeting agreed benchmarks associated with budget support. These shortfalls prompted
the authorities to curtail recurrent expenditures by 0.6 percent of GDP.

Key Issues Addressed

The lack of a transparent, competitive procurement process was inhibiting the
efficiency of public resource management. An expenditure review had shown that
between April 2003 and January 2004, only 10 percent of contract awards had been
subject to an open-tender process. With about 90 percent of government procurement not
subject to competitive bidding and widespread perceptions of corruption, lack of
transparency was a major impediment to efficient public resource management. By the
time of the appraisal of the first GRG operation, however, the Government had
demonstrated its commitment to address this by approving interim rules and regulations


2
  The GRG grants/credits were prepared in a manner consistent with IMF’s PRGF, following the agreed institutional
division of labor with the IMF taking the lead on the macroeconomic issues while the Bank took the lead on structural
and social issues. The IMF agreed in May 2006 on a medium-term economic program which was supported under the
PRGF in an amount equivalent to SDR 31.11 million (30 percent of quota).


                                                        22
for procurement and established the National Public Procurement Authority (NPPA),
responsible for procurement reform under the then Ministry of Finance.3

The Government had determined that decentralization of budget authority was a
key element of good governance and peacekeeping. A major concern of the
Government was that a key factor leading to the civil war was the disaffection of a large
segment of the rural population, essentially cut-off from political representation as a
result of the elimination of local government which had occurred in 1972. In particular,
rural areas were physically isolated from Freetown, the capital, by the lack of a
functioning road infrastructure. Furthermore, there was an enormous disparity in the
level of poverty in rural areas compared to Freetown. An analysis of a 2003 household
survey had shown that 79 percent of the rural population was living below the poverty
line compared to 22 percent in Freetown. Therefore decentralization was seen as a
fundamental element in poverty reduction.

Compared to most other countries, the business environment in Sierra Leone
ranked low, constraining opportunities for growth to meet development objectives.
According to the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) for
2005 65 out of 76 International Development Association (IDA) member countries
scored higher than Sierra Leone on the quality of the regulatory environment for business.
And Doing Business 2006, a World Bank Group publication that focuses on business law
and regulation, had ranked Sierra Leone 136 out of 155 countries surveyed. This
unfavorable business environment was likely responsible for the fact that nearly
80 percent of all economic activity was in the informal sector.

Dependence on an insufficiently diversified mining sector with structural
constraints was impeding potential export revenues. Sierra Leone depended
considerably on diamond exports for foreign exchange. The production of other minerals
and metals had ceased during the conflict period. Under normal industry practice,
exploration licenses are gradually converted to production licenses or withdrawn for lack
of results. However, in the non-competitive framework that had prevailed in Sierra
Leone, a single firm had obtained exclusive prospecting licenses covering nearly half of
the country. These holdings had neither been officially converted to production, nor
reduced. The Government was collecting about US$3-4 million in annual license fees,
far below what a competitive fee structure would have generated—an estimated
US$16 million annually.

Limited access to electric power, due in part to the high cost, and unreliable power
supply were constraining economic activity and poverty reduction. In 2005, there
were no more than 44,581 registered customers for the National Power Authority (NPA),
most of them in Freetown. Electricity consumption in 2004 from the NPA was estimated
to be only 55 kilowatt-hours per-capita compared to the regional average of 495 kilowatt-

  In early 2010, the Ministry of Finance became known as the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development,
following its merger with the Ministry of Economic Planning.

                                                   23
hours per-capita and 8,503 kWh per capita in member countries of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development. Yet Sierra Leoneans were paying some of the
highest tariff rates per kilowatt-hour in the region, between US¢19 and US¢28. And even
with such high tariffs, revenues were insufficient to cover the system costs of US¢37 per
kilowatt-hour and contribute to investments in the expansion of the power system.

Rationale for Bank Assistance

The Program supported the Government’s poverty reduction strategies, the
foundation for all development assistance. GRGG-1 and GRGC-2 took place within
the framework of the first PRSP, which had established three pillars to support higher
growth: (i) good governance, security and peace building; (ii) pro-poor, sustainable
growth for food security and job creation; and (iii) human development.4 GRGC-3 also
supported the second PRSP (2008 to 2012), which maintained the same pillars as the first,
but focused more on development of infrastructure and priority productive sectors.

The Bank had committed, together with other development partners, to help Sierra
Leone improve governance and enhance growth prospects. In July 2006, the Bank
had entered into the Improved Governance and Accountability Pact with three other
development partners: the African Development Bank (AfDB), the European Community
(EC) and the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DfID).5 This
Pact reasserted the commitment of the Government to good governance and defined a
number of activities to enhance government transparency and accountability, create a
more conducive investment climate for private sector development and improve public
service delivery in the health and education sectors. For the monitoring and evaluation of
budget support activities, the four development partners had agreed to multi-donor budget
support (MDBS) framework which set out clear goals and monitorable performance
indicators. The Pact also committed the four development partners to harmonization of
their activities with government programs. The World Bank and AfDB focused on

  The program for good governance consisted of a strengthened anti-corruption agenda; improved public financial
management, better public service delivery through capacity building, decentralized service delivery, and better
statistics for monitoring outcomes. To support sustainable growth, the PRSP emphasized maintenance of
macroeconomic stability through appropriate fiscal and monetary policies and effective debt management; support for
key productive sectors and investments in infrastructure needed for these sectors to thrive. Finally, the pillar for
advancing human development covered improvements in health and education services along with affordable housing,
greater gender equality and improved environmental management.

5
  This Pact asserted the Government’s commitment to good governance, establishing three sets of activities based on
each of the three pillars in the first PRSP. In support of PRSP Pillar One, the activities included: free and fair elections,
anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, procurement reform, strengthening the Office of the Auditor-General, civil
service reform, and decentralization in the management of public resources. The activities under Pillar Two activities
focused on creating a conducive investment environment and greater transparency in Sierra Leone’s extractive
industries. Under Pillar Three, activities focused on better public service delivery in health and education. The Pact
also committed the four donor agencies to harmonizing their budget support with the Government's program. This was
subsequently superseded in 2010by a revised framework for harmonizing budget support with the Government’s
program.

different policy areas of public financial management while DfID and EC gave particular
attention to policies and actions concerning human development, particularly
improvements in health care and education.

The Bank had financed four policy based operations for the recovery and
rehabilitation of the economy, contributing to the restoration of the country’s
platform for growth. These operations, which took place between 2001 and 2006, had
financed imports of essential commodities, enabling the Government to channel
resources to priority expenditures for the rehabilitation of physical, social and economic
infrastructure. The provision of financing for imports under these operations was linked
to policy actions designed to improve governance, enhance macroeconomic stability and
advance human development. Implementation completion and results reports (ICRRs)
had rated the performance of all of these operations as satisfactory.

The Government of Sierra Leone had shown substantial commitment to governance
reform to support economic growth and human development. Government
commitment to reform was firm as evidenced through implementation of the previous
series of operations, which had supported economic recovery and rehabilitation. The
Government had also recognized the need for budget support to uphold its commitment
to poverty reduction and maintain macroeconomic stability. The Government also
planned a gradual increase in poverty-related expenditures from three percent of GDP in
2007 to six percent of GDP by 2010. The Bank joined other donors in coordinating a
program of budget support linked to achieving the MDGs.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

Objectives

The development objectives, directly aligned with the policy areas, were: (i) preserve
fiscal space for poverty reduction; (ii) promote efficiency, transparency and
accountability in the use of public resources; and (iii) improve the investment climate and
promote exports through policies for the development of mining sector (GRGG-1 and
GRGC-2) and the provision of electricity in a fiscally sustainable manner (GRGC-3).

Outcome Indicators

The outcome indicators listed below, by objective, were used to access the results of
the policy actions taken. The Datasheet provides the details on results compared to
benchmarks and targets. Section 3.2 discusses the extent to which the program achieved
the objectives taking account of prior actions and actual results for outcome indicators.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

There was no revision of the Program’s development objectives.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

GRGG-1 covered a subset of the policy areas supported by the Multi Donor Budget
Support (MDBS) partners, comprising the African Development Bank (AFDB),
European Commission (EC), the United Kingdom’s Department for International
Development (DfID) and IDA. These consisted of macroeconomic risk management,


                                           26
monitoring and evaluation of the poverty reduction strategy, and the three pillars of the
PRSP: Good Governance (Pillar 1), Pro-Poor Growth and Job Creation (Pillar 2) and
Human Development (Pillar 3). The subset, under the governance and growth pillars,
were to: (i) preserve the fiscal space needed for poverty reduction; (ii) promote
efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public resources; and (iii)
improve the investment climate and promote exports. The GRG operations grouped all
prior actions for tranche release and related impact indicators under these policy areas,
which also became the common objectives.

Policy Area 1: Preserve the fiscal space needed for poverty reduction

The priority action for all three operations was to improve the ratio of actual to
planned priority expenditures for poverty reduction. Also, GRGG-1 required the
Ministry of Finance to adopt regulations to protect poverty-reduction expenditures in the
event of budget shortfalls. Complementing these regulations was Government agreement
to strengthen the portfolio of the BSL by converting non-interest bearing securities to
interest-bearing assets.

Policy Area 2: Promote Efficiency, Transparency and Accountability in the use of public
resources

The focus of GRG actions was on improving procurement planning and building
government capacity for better public resource management. Policy actions called
for increasing the number of ministries producing approved procurement plans. Under
GRGG-1, NPPA was required to hire qualified core staff. GRGC-2 and GRGC-3
provided for actions to reform the civil service. Both GRGC-2 and GRGC-3 established
benchmarks for the share of procurement conducted through open competition in order to
enhance transparency. Finally, all three GRGC operations contained prior actions to
decentralize government operations for greater efficiency and local autonomy, through
the transfer of budgetary resources to local councils.

Policy Area 3: Improve the Investment Climate and Promote Exports

GRG operations focused on policies to enhance prospects for expanding private
sector development, privatization, improve infrastructure and support the
development of key extractive industries. Policy actions supported an improved legal
framework for privatization and business start-ups. The operations also promoted the
advancement of the cadastral system for expanding mining licenses along with increased
staff for extension services in the mining sector. Regarding infrastructure for growth,
GRGC-3 included a policy action to improve revenue collection by the NPA in order to
enhance the financial viability of the utility and increase electricity supply, particularly in
Freetown.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

There were no revisions in policy areas supported.

GRGC-3 required additional financing to meet objectives, as discussed in Section 2
below.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

All GRG programs were single-tranche operations, with a total disbursement of
US$37 million over a four-year period (2006-2010), as shown in Table 1.

                  Table 1: GRG Series Tranche Amounts and Release Dates

Table 2 shows the prior actions and implementation status for the release of funds
for all three GRG operations. While a number of prior actions were modified relative
to the original wording of triggers to take account of various operational difficulties
encountered during implementation that could not have been anticipated, it should also be
noted that a few were modified to give credit for better than anticipated performance.

and debt service, will improve relative to the 2005
baseline of 10.5 percent.

Agreed Prior Actions
The ratio of actual to budgeted spending on HIPC
PRSP priorities in the second half of 2007 is not
smaller than the ratio of actual to budgeted
expenditures for all other discretionary primary
expenditures. In addition, any spending from
miscellaneous budget head 501, or any other budget
head for unallocated expenditures, will be made in
full conformity with sections 25(4) and 25(5) of the
Government Budgeting and Accountability Act
(2005) starting from January 2008 and verified on a
quarterly basis.

Reason for change: excessive spending through the
miscellaneous budget (head 501) and delayed donor
financing resulted in below target expenditures on
poverty reducing programs. The revised prior action
reflects improved protection of poverty reducing
expenditures in the second half of 2007.

Agreed Prior Action
The budgetary funds actually transferred to local
councils in the first three quarters of 2007, expressed
as a share of total discretionary non-salary, non-
interest recurrent spending, will be within four
percentage points of the budgeted share for the first
three quarters of 2007.

Reason for change: The trigger requiring timely
transfer of resources to local councils in 2006 was
modified to focus on 2007 and accommodate
budgetary uncertainties while still maintaining the
intended relative improvement in resource transfers.
MOFED did not have full information about 2006
when the policy action was discussed but believed
the transfers had been made in full. Subsequent
estimates revealed that they were wrong. By the
time of Appraisal, data for the first three-quarters of
2007 had become available and was substituted.
The unit of measurement was changed to budgetary
shares because nearly all spending was reduced
when revenues and grants fell well below budget
targets. (See 2010 PEFA report, indicators PI-2 and
PI-3.)

Reason for change: The trigger specifying full
national coverage by the cadastral system for mining
rights was divided into a target that was to cover the
two most important mining regions as a first step
(GRGC-2 prior action) and a final target for seeking
full national coverage for artisanal and industrial
mining through establishment of new offices in
Kenema and Bo (GRGC-3 trigger). This change
was made because of reduced fiscal resources in the
first half of 2007 and because the original trigger
was too optimistic with regard to ministry capacity.

new offices for installation of the cadastral system in
the remaining key mining areas centered around
Kenema and Bo.

discretionary primary expenditures.

Agreed Prior Action
The variance in expenditure composition in 2008 for
the 20 largest budget heads will not exceed the
overall deviation in domestic primary expenditures
by more than 10 percentage points.

Reason for change: The list of poverty reducing
programs includes local council transfers with the
consequence that a substantial shortfall in transfers
would also induce a shortfall in spending on poverty
reducing programs. Thus, this trigger was replaced
by an alternative prior action drawn from the MDBS
PAF that focused on variances in expenditure
composition in the 20 largest budget heads in excess
of the aggregate variance in spending induced by
shocks to net resource availability. While there is a
strong overlap between the list of the 20 largest
budget heads and the list of poverty reducing
programs, this alternative measure had the
advantage of explicitly accounting for aggregate
shocks such as the shortfall in fourth quarter 2008
external aid. In addition, it is noteworthy that the
share of discretionary spending allocated to poverty
reducing priorities increased over time, from
32 percent of the total in 2001 to 64 percent of the
total in 2009.

The fourth quarter 2008 transfers to local councils
could not be met due to substantial shortfalls in
donor aid and over-spending in budget head 501.
Consequently, the same wording adopted for the

applied to 2008 outcomes, confining the prior action
to the first three-quarters of the year.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

Revenues consistently fell below budget targets, while external grants did not make up
the resultant shortfalls (Table 4).

Toward the end of the program, the global economic downturn eroded fiscal space
required for poverty reduction expenditures, necessitating supplemental financing.
As indicated above, GDP growth during GRGC-3 plummeted to 3.2 percent in 2009, at
the outset of GRGC-3, due in large part to the impact of the global economic downturn,
which diminished export earnings of the country’s mining sector, primarily diamonds.
The decline in exports combined with higher levels of spending led to a financing gap of
$27.5 million for priority expenditures under the PRSP. The Supplemental Credit for
GRGC-3 provided US$7 million to close the gap and other donors provided the
additional US$20.5 million (DfID, US$7.5 million and the EC, US$13 million). Closing
this gap helped ensure continued commitment to priority expenditures under PRSP-2.

The Government demonstrated a high level of commitment to Program objectives
through major policy actions necessary to support expected outcomes. A key
element of Program success was the Government’s high-level ownership of policy,
evidenced by their willingness to embed them in its reform agenda. The staffing of
NPPA and regulations for increasing the number of ministries, departments and agencies
(MDAs) submitting procurement were major steps toward greater efficiency and
transparency in government procurement. The restoration of local government after
30 years and the transfer of budgetary resources to local councils were major
advancements in the Government’s commitment to decentralization. The Parliament’s
passage of the General Law on Business Startups, the Registration of Business Act
resulted in lower business costs and encouraged enterprises to join the formal business
sector. It is likely that this legislation played a major role in the increased number of new
businesses during the GRG operations.

The GRG operations benefitted from substantial analytical work, with each
successive operation incorporating lessons from the previous operation. The initial
operation provided the foundational analysis for the entire program with updates of the
areas common to all three operations—improvements to the business climate and
financial sector as well as the key areas of governance covered—procurement reform,
capacity building, transparency in government accounting, etc.

Several documents provided the analytical foundation for the focus on better
efficiency and transparency in governance: Country Financial Accountability
Assessment, the HIPC Assessment and Action Plan, public expenditure reviews, and the
corruption surveys used in the Governance Report. The annual Doing Business Report
and a special report on unemployment identified constraints in the business climate
requiring reform. The GRG operations also required specialized analytical work to
support policy actions in the mining sector and the power sector.


                                             41
An analysis of the (2003) household survey available at the inception of the GRG
series found deep poverty and identified artisanal miners among the poorest groups,
motivating support for mining sector reform. A mining and minerals sector review
pointed out the need for additional extension services for enhanced production, safety and
environmental protection.

In determining policy actions in the power sector, the GRG series relied on the
background papers from the preparation of the Power and Water Project, which
established the need for financial reforms. In addition, the 2009 Poverty Diagnostic
helped guide the decision to raise tariffs. It found that the planned tariff increase would
not adversely affect vulnerable groups and that it could in fact be “pro poor? if it
expanded public resources targeted to help the poor.

The program documents, recognizing Sierra Leone as a fragile state, contained
detailed risk analyses and mitigation measures. The most significant risks identified
were exogenous shocks to the economy, failure to secure timely adequate funding for the
budget and fiduciary risk of weak institutional capacity and governance. All three of
these conditions materialized during the GRG operations under review. For exogenous
shocks, the mitigation was the government’s track record of macroeconomic stability.
The country has absorbed the exogenous shock of the global recession since 2008,
developing a response plan to protect stability. There were delays in donor funding for
which the mitigation measure was essentially continuous dialogue with donors committed
to working with the country. The Government’s response was to reduce planned PRSP
related expenditures.

Fiduciary concerns were responsible for the delay in release of donor funds early in
the program (2007). The mitigation measure for fiduciary risk was the strengthening of
the fiduciary environment, which took place; a key action was reducing the backlog of
published public accounts. The result was increased donor confidence and eventual
release of funds. In addition, the appraisal of GRG operations identified political risks;
however, throughout the Program, the political environment remained stable and the
Government stayed committed to achieving the objectives.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The M&E for the GRG operations took place within the context of the MDBS
framework of the four development partners. Through the Memorandum of
Understanding noted above for the MDBS, the development partners agreed to a
harmonized framework of monitorable performance indicators. Each donor reserved the
right, however, to maintain its own conditions for the release of funds. Key conditions
for continued support from the development partners consisted of: the maintenance of an
appropriate macroeconomic framework, satisfactory progress in poverty reduction
policies, and continued improvements in adhering to fiduciary standards. The donor
group was to meet annually to evaluate progress under the MDBS framework.



                                            42
The design of the M&E framework evolved over the course of the three GRG
operations. The framework consisted of outcome indicators to assess the impact of the
policy actions implemented for tranche release. As Table 3 shows, the indicators evolved
over time to be more measurable and were reduced in number. GRGG-1 and GRGC-2
had 19 and 13 indicators, respectively, some of which had no targets or benchmarks
associated with them. Under GRGC-3, however, there was a substantial reduction in the
number of indicators to nine, all of which had measurable targets. This reduction
reflected the decision of the donors participating in the MDBS group to streamline the
indicators, taking account of the capacity to evaluate them.

  The Bank implemented the M&E framework through status reporting and the data
  was utilized to facilitate performance discussions. The Bank reported on performance
  indicators in the Implementation Status and Results (ISR) reports. Based on the ISRs
  available for the Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) report, the quality of
  information was fair. The main sources of information were the reviews under the
  Progress Assessment Framework (PAF), prepared jointly with the MDBS partners.

  The aide memoires of supervision missions and management letters for GRG
  operations indicate the M&E framework was used to evaluate progress and adapt
  the performance measures to evolving concerns. For example, initially the Program
  tracked the share of actual to budgeted expenditures for poverty reduction. However,
  given the findings that the Government was consistently under-spending for poverty
  reduction activities due to shortfalls and delays in disbursements of donor support as well
  as over-spending in other categories of discretionary expenditures, subsequent operations
  shifted the measure from a, “weighted average absolute deviation between planned and
  actual spending, expressed as a percentage of the budgeted amounts, for all HIPC/PRSP
  spending by budget head, ? which did not take into account shocks to revenues and
  grants, to “The difference between the ratio of actual to budgeted spending on

HIPC/PRSP priorities and the ratio of actual to budgeted expenditures for all other
discretionary primary expenditures.?

The indicators measuring the preservation of fiscal space for poverty reduction
proved to be both too ambitious in their complexity and subject to shocks beyond
government control. Despite this, the data indicate that an effort was made to protect
the fiscal space for poverty reducing activities (Table 4).

Several of the PFM indicators originally specified in GRGG-1 were discontinued,
notably those from the HIPC AAP which were later superseded by the PEFA
indicators. Thus, although the original outcome indicators cannot be measured, the
general intent of the PDO can still be tested, i.e., whether there was adequate promotion
of efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public resources. The 2010
PEFA indicates solid progress, noting that “The regulatory framework for PFM has been
positively transformed by the adoption of a number of new laws.? There were improved
scores for 10 of the 28 indicators under government control, with only four downgrades.

Several of the procurement indicators proved too ambitious for the newly
established NPPA to track. The NPPA had a limited number of staff, who had to attend

                                                      45
to all aspects of procurement work in addition to tracking outcomes. As a result, the
number of indicators was reduced and focused on the two goals of increased use of
procurement plans and open competitive bidding.

Although not all of the investment environment indicators could be measured, the
annual Doing Business report shows clear gains between outcomes in 2006 and those
reported in 2010. The number of procedures, days required and costs are generally
reduced while some investor protections improved. The number of documents and time
required to export and import have also been reduced. Thus, the PDO to improve the
investment climate and promote exports was clearly met.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

The Supplemental Credit for GRGC-3 was the final operation of the first GRG
series, designed to support the first PRSP. In 2010, the Bank approved the initial
credit for a second series of GRG operations (GRGC-4) supporting the second PRSP. Its
objectives are to: (i) improve the allocation and efficiency of public spending to support
poverty reduction; (ii) strengthen domestic resource mobilization and management; and
(iii) increase provision of electricity. The operation is fully consistent with the new Joint
Assistance Strategy (JAS), covering FY10-13 and its pillar to promote inclusive growth.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Sierra Leone continues to rely on budgetary finance from its development partners
to protect expenditures on poverty reduction. The country has depended significantly
on external development partners, which have provided financing for 25-35 percent of
budgetary expenditures during the period under review, though most recently that has
begun to decline. This level of dependence may continue, in the foreseeable future,
particularly given the global economic downturn. In 2010, the Bank and the MDBS
partners entered into a new, more comprehensive Memorandum of Understanding
governing the provision of budgetary financing.

Provision of budgetary financing is a key element in the Joint Assistance Strategy of
the Bank and the AfDB6 in Sierra Leone for FY10-FY-13. Complementing policy
based lending were investment projects in other key sectors of the PRSP—notably
agriculture, the management and development of transport infrastructure, health,
education, etc and a better investment climate.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Objective 1: Preserve the Fiscal Space Needed for Poverty Reduction

The Program improved the overall preservation of fiscal space for poverty
reduction expenditures but performance in meeting targets for improved budget
execution was mixed. The Government exceeded the benchmark floor in 2005
(Le 202 billion) but at Le 311 billion for 2008, fell slightly short of the target for that year
(Le 327 billion). Regarding budget execution performance, prior actions for the Program
improved the ratio of actual to budgeted expenditures for priority poverty-reduction
measures compared to expenditures on the miscellaneous budget head. And by the end
of the Program, actual Government expenditures on priority poverty-reduction activities
amounted to 102 percent of budgeted expenditures. The Program did not, however, meet
the target (set for GRGC-2 and GRGC-3) of the difference between the ratio of actual to
budgeted expenditures on poverty-reduction priorities compared to a similar ratio for
other discretionary primary expenditures greater than or equal to zero percent.

Objective 2: Promote Efficiency, Transparency and Accountability in the Use of Public
Resources

The performance in achieving this objective was impressive for some important
indicators but there were also some shortcomings. The performance measures were
heavily weighted in support of this objective. For example, GRGG-1 had eight outcome
indicators of which six had no targets and thus were not measured. Of the two targets
with measurable indicators, the program met the target number of public entities
producing procurement plans for Ministry of Finance approval but fell short of hiring the
target number of staff for Accountant General’s Department (AGD), hiring eight staff
instead of 15. By contrast, GRGC-3 had seven performance indicators, of which six had
measurable targets.

The achievement of three very important indicators for improved transparency and
efficiency in government was quite high. First, 43 government entities produced
procurement plans for 2009 compared to a target of 23 entities. Second, the share of total
procurement above the national, small-purchase threshold for competitive bidding
amounted to 69 percent in 2008, compared to a target of 30 percent or greater. Third, the
program authenticated 100 percent of civil service payroll entries in 2008 compared to a
target of 95 percent. The Bank was unable to obtain information on the achievement of
two indicators: (i) the percent share of funds spent for the purposes stated in procurement
plans; and (ii) percent share of procurements no higher than 15 percent of the amounts in
the procurement plans.

Progress was made in decentralization of authority to local government but it was
less than planned. The indicators for decentralization concerned the share of funding
transferred to local councils for management. Performance in this transfer fell slightly
short of target with budgetary funds transferred to local councils, as a share of total,

                                              47
discretionary, non-interest recurrent funding, at 13.3 percent compared to a target of 15.8
percent.

Objective 3: Improve the investment climate and promote exports

The Government made substantial progress in developing policies and procedures
conducive to expanding private sector development. Sierra Leone’s National
Commission for Privatization established transparent procedures for the sale, transfer or
disposal of equity assets. The Parliament, in July 2007, approved legislation that
significantly reduced the complexity and cost of business registration (the General Law
on Business Start-Ups and the Registration of Business Act). This law was designed to
help stimulate private investment and encourage firms to join the formal sector.

Complementing reforms for private sector development, the Government also made
major improvements in the development of the financial sector. In August 2009, the
Government adopted a full Financial Sector Development Plan, the Companies Act
(2009), the Bankruptcy Act (2009), the Payment Systems Act (2008), and the Securities
Act (2008), a venture capital scheme, based on the recommendations from the 2006/07
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).

Linked to policy actions for private sector development and in the financial sector
were indicators for the growth of new firms. The growth of new firms was
substantially higher than the target, greater than or equal to 14 percent instead of the
planned five percent. The growth was lower than the benchmark (41 percent). A better
measure of the impact may, however, be in the actual number of firms registered, which
increased from 2,226 in 2005 to 3,705 in 2008, an increase of 66 percent.

Government revenues from the mining sector increased with the implementation of
mining sector policies under the GRG operations. Policy actions focused on
expansion of a cadastral system for the administration of mineral licensing and increasing
the number of mining service extension staff in the key mining regions. Government
revenues from mining licenses, fees and surface rents increased from Le 4.7 billion in
2005 to Le 6.0 billion in 2007.

The production of key extractive industries, dormant during the conflict period,
resumed operation but production performance compared to plan was mixed.
Under GRGG-1, there were no targets for exports of the principal extractive industries
monitored (bauxite, gold and rutile). Exports of rutile (from one operating mine)
remained fairly constant between 2006 and 2008, at around 70,000 tons. Information on
actual gold production was not available for GRGG-1 but under GRGC-2 gold output
(from one mine), at 10,000 ounces in 2008, was significantly higher than the target for
that year (6,000 ounces). The production of bauxite in 2008 (815,000 tons) was about
18 percent lower than the target for that year (1,000,000 tons).

The performance indicators for the NPA during the period of GRGC-3 showed an
improving trend. The main policy action in the power sector was the implementation of

                                            48
a tariff increase in the second half of 2008. Both power generation and sales exceeded
their respective benchmarks between 2008 and 2010, with generation increasing from
138 GWH to 174 GWH and NPA Sales from 79 GWH to 102 GWH. Collection by NPA
also improved from Le 46 billion in 2008 to 88 billion in 2010, surpassing the target of
Le 60 billion.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The objectives of the GRG operations remain highly relevant for Sierra Leone.
Sierra Leone depends considerably on the Bank and other donors for financing its
budget, equivalent to as much as 7-8 percent of GDP. In 2010, this is estimated to
have totaled about US$80 million, with an additional US$110 million being provided
through project support.       Protecting poverty-reduction expenditures, continued
improvements in governance improvements and measures to expand growth and exports
remain highly relevant to the country’s development and attainment of the MDGs. The
Bank has already financed the first operation in a new series of budget support programs,
discussed in Section 2.4.

The achievement of governance and growth objectives was satisfactory but the
protection of fiscal space for poverty reduction was only moderately satisfactory.
The Government made great strides in improving efficiency and transparency in
procurement, with relatively minor shortcomings. The program also made substantial
progress in improving the investment climate for growth, with some positive
developments in the output of important extractive industries and improved performance
of the power sector. It fell short, however, of meeting the main indicator for protecting
poverty-related expenditures, continuing the past trend of under-spending for HIPC
priorities and over-spending for non-HIPC priorities.

In the final operation of the series (GRGC-3), actual poverty-reduction expenditures
were reported as 102 percent of the budgeted amount (for 2009), considerably
higher than the 57 percent in the benchmark year (2007). Nevertheless, the Bank and
other donors considered a comparative measurement with other budget categories
important because of a past trend to over spend in these categories and under-spend for
poverty-reduction. In the absence of detailed evaluation criteria, a rating scheme and
scale has been constructed in Table 5 below, covering several possible outcomes for the
performance in protecting poverty-reduction expenditures. Combining the actual
outcomes with the criteria in the table, spending 102 percent of budgeted amounts but
with a negative divergence (12 percent) of more than 10 percent from a similar measure
for other expenditures, the rating is moderately satisfactory.

                                        than 10 percent


Weighing the three objectives along with relevance, external factors, institutional
development, and implementation evaluations, the overall outcome was satisfactory.
The overall outcome is difficult to evaluate because of the lack of priority ranking among
objectives and performance indicators for each objective. Despite the moderately
satisfactory rating for protecting the fiscal space for poverty reduction, the ICR has rated
the overall outcome satisfactory because: (i) the other two objectives were satisfactory
and resulted in considerable institutional development; (ii) actual poverty reduction
expenditures exceeded the budgeted amount; and (iii) in intermediate years, external
factors outside the Government’s control adversely affected the availability of funds for
these expenditures—the global economic downturn and uncertainties in donor funding,
played a role in the shortfalls.

The ICR report’s rating also took into account the Program’s supervision ratings.
Based on the ISRs available, the GRG ended with a satisfactory rating. Early in the
Program, the Bank had rated GRGG-1 as moderately unsatisfactory due to delays in
meeting triggers, poor economic management and fiduciary concerns. In doing so,
however, the Bank noted that it considered this rating an aberration in a record of good
performance and the two subsequent operations received satisfactory ratings.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development




                                                50
Despite some poverty reduction over the GRGC series, without a return to high
levels of growth, the country will not meet the MDGs by 2015 as planned. The
GRGC program tracked as part of the M&E framework, expenditures on poverty
reduction, not actual changes in the percentage of the population living in poverty. Each
successive operation, however, reported on changes in the poverty headcount, depending
on the availability of information. According to the 2009 Sierra Leone Poverty
Diagnostic, the poverty headcount decreased to an estimated 62 percent in 2007
compared to 70 percent at appraisal of the initial GRG operation.

The global economic recession as well as the food and fuel crises, however, could
easily have eroded these gains and despite improvements the level of human
development remains quite low. For example, in 2010, Sierra Leone ranked 158 out of
169 countries in the United Nations Human Development Index, an improvement over a
bottom ranking out of 179 countries in 2008. The planned rate of economic growth for
achieving the target reduction of the population living below the poverty line to about 40
percent was between eight and nine percent. With growth less than half that rate and
2015 only three years away, it appears likely that the country will have to adjust the
timing of this achievement.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The program contributed to substantial institutional strengthening in the areas of
public financial management, procurement, mining sector development, and power
system management. Section 2.2 discusses the institutional development and its impact
on program implementation.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

There are no other such outcomes that have not been discussed elsewhere.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Significant

              Table 6: Rating of Key Risks Likely to Affect Outcome of GRG Series
      Risk Category                                    Rating
      Macroeconomic Performance                        Significant
      Fiduciary Performance                            Significant
      Political Factors                                Significant

The ICR finds the risk to development outcome significant in all three categories of
risk evaluation. The key factors that could impede macroeconomic performance are a
prolonged global recession, dampening growth as well as a rapid rise in international
commodity prices for food and/or fuel. The resulting impact could be a further
deterioration in the terms of trade and setbacks in the Government’s ambitious program
for infrastructure development necessary to spur growth. These factors threaten
macroeconomic stability and significantly reduce the fiscal space for poverty reduction
expenditures.

Regarding fiduciary risk, although public financial management has improved,
there remains the possibility that continued deficiencies in institutional capacity or
corruption could adversely affect fiduciary performance. In particular, while strong
gains have been documented in the PEFA and elsewhere with regard to internal
accountability, the political leadership (regardless of party affiliation) is only slowly
embracing the concept of external accountability for good results in public service
delivery. For this reason, the risks remain high. The mitigating factors are the strong
commitment of the Government to projects to support capacity building and public
financial management reform, and the continued growing involvement of civil society in
oversight activities.

On the political side, as the 2012 elections draw closer, there is the risk of an adverse
impact on economic management and public finances. It is worth noting, however,
that whatever the outcome of the elections, there seems to be only a moderate risk of a
substantial reversal of the country’s improving trend in governance.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Bank performance was satisfactory in both ensuring quality at entry and in
implementation support, with only minor shortcomings.


                                              52
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The program’s design benefited from substantial analytical work (Section 2.2) with
the participation of specialists in the various governance areas, such as public
financial management and institutional reform, as well as related to growth—
private sector development, mining sector planning and operations, and power
sector development. The design also reflected several of the key factors highlighted
subsequently in the World Development Report, 2011, regarding the transformation of
institutions in fragile, post-conflict states: a systematic program of phased capacity
building and expanded accountability, anti-corruption measures (through
actions/performance indicators for increased transparency of procurement) and
decentralization for greater inclusion of the population, thus strengthening peace and
security. The main shortcoming was the performance measurement for the objective of
preserving fiscal space for poverty reduction. As discussed in Section 3.3, the main
indicator of achievement for this objective could have been improved with more
calibration in the measurement of the extent of the deviation between actual and planned
expenditures on poverty reduction. The design and implementation period of this
operation, coincided with the introduction of the new results framework into these
operations.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

The GRG Program benefited from consistency in team leadership of supervision
over all three GRG operations, which was the same as at appraisal of the initial
operation and at the end of the previous operations focused on post-conflict
recovery. The appraisals of the second and third operations were cumulative, reviewing
progress in the previous operations and incorporating lessons learned in program design
and implementation. The supervision of the Program included at least one mission
annually and one ISR report was prepared for each operation. Bank management also did
not hesitate to rate the initial GRG operation moderately unsatisfactory, to call attention
to and rectify, problems that threatened a satisfactory outcome for the GRG series of
operations, pressing the IMF to rethink an overly ambitious framework under the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility then underway.

The donors participating in the MBDS forum met annually in June to assess
performance of the entire program including the relevant GRG operation. Donor
coordination resulted in improved performance measurement, by reducing the total
number of performance indicators and enhancing specificity, as noted in Section 3.3.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

                                            53
A satisfactory rating in both dimensions—ensuring quality at entry and supervision—
results in an overall satisfactory rating.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The Government showed substantial commitment to the GRG Program and a
major contributing factor to this success was embedding the operations in the
Government’s reform program. While there were some temporary distractions from
the first operation in the series due to elections, the Government worked with the Bank to
get the program back on track and made significant progress with daily cash-flow
monitoring, new revenue efforts, and reforms in public financial management. Also
considerable institutional development took place, over the course of the program, as
noted in Section 3.4 (b).

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, the implementing agency
prepared comprehensive, detailed letters of development policy containing clear
strategies for improved governance and growth policies leading to poverty reduction.
The Ministry gave particular attention to anti-corruption efforts, citing both successes and
shortcomings. Officials at the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development were
consistently accessible to the Bank and engaged in following up on progress in meeting
triggers for GRG operations. The main shortcoming was the lack of formal monthly
reporting to the Bank, as indicated in the implementation framework of the GRG program
documents. Given capacity constraints, however, such frequency of reporting may have
been excessive.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Ratings: Satisfactory

A satisfactory rating in both dimensions—Government performance and Implementing
Agency performance—results in an overall satisfactory rating.

6. Lessons Learned

      In the case of Sierra Leone the GRG series helped to consolidate and entrench the
       local councils which were re-established after a 30 year absence. This resulted
       from a strong shared understanding—between Government and many external
       stakeholders—about the importance of re-establishing government presence

                                            54
       around the country, and the role that the lack of such a government presence
       played in the conflict.

      For a post-conflict country in a fragile, state-building process, the benefits of a
       programmatic approach to policy operations are likely to outweigh the risks,
       particularly the opportunity to revaluate progress before each successive operation.

      If the timing of the approval process of donors for budget support is not well
       aligned with the Government’s budgetary process, the program support for
       poverty reduction risks shortfalls due to uncertainty in funding.

      Embedding policy reforms in the Government’s reform agenda instills greater
       government ownership of the program, diminishing the risk of delays or
       shortcomings in achieving objectives.

      For an operation that involves coordinating actions in several sectors, outside the
       authority of the main implementing agency, the achievement of targets is more
       likely if disaggregated into a set of measurable indicators with clearly-defined
       administrative responsibilities in a given ministry, department or agency.

      In a country short of management capacity, a detailed M&E framework is not
       likely to be sustainable without intensive donor inputs and supervision. Also the
       requirement for monthly reports to be provided by the Ministry of Finance may
       have been onerous and excessive, discouraging any reporting.

           MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

This report provides the Government of Sierra Leone’s perspective to the implementation
outcome of the World Bank’s series of Governance Reform and Growth Grant/Credit
(GRGG/C) received over the period 2006 through 2010. It covers a brief assessment of
the institutional impact in terms of the extent to which the project has improved the
economy and the country's ability to enhance public service delivery within the context of
structural and institutional reforms undertaken, sustainability, lessons learnt and
conclusions.

Introduction:

The World Bank’s GRGG/C programme, packaged in series, comprised components of
grants and credit. The packages were delivered as a development policy operation facility
designed to support the Government of Sierra Leone refocus its economic and social
development policies from post-conflict emergency recovery and state building to a more
broad-based programmatic development strategy within the framework of the country’s
Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). An earlier four series of the World Bank Economic
Rehabilitation and Recovery Credit (ERRC) programme provided strong support to the
post-conflict recovery efforts, and subsequently required consolidation and deepening to
sustain economic development. The GRGG/C series provided critical foreign currency
for imports of essential commodities, preserve the fiscal space needed for poverty
reduction, promote efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public
resources, improve the investment climate and promote exports, and achieve progress in
the poverty reduction strategy against a slow down associated with the global economic
and financial crises.

Government implemented a wide range of structural and institutional reforms within the
framework of the Multi-Donor Budget Support (MDBS) Progress Assessment
Framework (PAF) to bolster capacity and harmonize systems to optimize service delivery.

The strong and combined support of the Multi-Donor Budget Support partners was
critical to successfully conclude the GRGG/C operations.

Institution Development Impact

Achievement

The GRGG/C programme was delivered at a very challenging time when the global
economic down-turn was severally weakening the economic prospects in 2007 through
2009 thereby putting pressure on the fiscal position. The mining sector, which is the
country’s major foreign exchange earner, was particularly hard hit with declines in world
market prices, delayed investments, and scaled back production. Remittances were
declining and the exchange rate of the Leone was eroding in value terms against the

                                           62
major international currencies. The foreign exchange resources of the GRGG/C operation
enabled Government to provide for the importation of essential commodities including
food products, petroleum products, raw materials and intermediate goods. Through the
Bank of Sierra Leone Weekly Foreign Exchange Auction window foreign exchange
funds were made accessible to meet private sector requirements for the import of
essential commodities. The local currency proceeds of the funds facilitated, in part, to
finance priority public expenditures, including funding the implementation of activities
within the scope promoting good governance, decentralization of government,
management of public resources and private sector-led economic growth, and to close the
financing gap for the maintenance of macroeconomic stability while keeping inflation
low.

Despite the challenges posed by the global economic downturn, the country made
substantial progress in sustaining the growth trajectory, maintaining macroeconomic
stability and helped reduce the number of the population living below the poverty line of
US$1 per day from 70 percent in 2004 down to about 50 percent in 2010.

Macroeconomic Performance

GDP Growth Rate

Achieving economic growth and maintaining macroeconomic stability through prudent
and effective management was the thrust of government’s macroeconomic management
strategy over the GRGG/C operational period. In 2008, economic activity slowed down
in the latter part of the year, particularly in the mining sector, although agricultural
production and the service sector remained buoyant. Sector wise government spending
was re-oriented in favor of the main drivers of growth. Real GDP averaged 6.7 percent in
2006-2008. Subsequently, high public expenditures on the main growth drivers including
roads, energy, water supply and agriculture stimulated growth to average almost 6
percent in 2007-2010 despite the global economic downturn. Sierra Leone’s main export
earner, diamonds, as well as remittances from abroad were adversely impacted. The
growth trajectory was supported mainly by increased activities in manufacturing and
agricultural output, mining, public investment in basic infrastructure, housing and the
services sector.

Inflation Rate

The resources provided under the GRGG/C operation came at a time when food prices
were escalating, and the pass-through effects of the increases in oil prices resulted in an
acceleration of inflation in 2007 and 2008. End of period inflation rates for food were 15
percent and 19 percent respectively for 2007 and 2008. However, the GRGG/C
operations provided partly the needed foreign exchange resources required by the private
sector to import essential commodities and fuel inducing inflationary pressures
downward toward the end of 2008 due to the steep decline in import prices (mainly fuel).
Thus, the average end of period inflation rate fell to 12.2 percent at end-2008, compared
to 13.8 percent for the previous year. Inflation declined to 7.5 percent at end-March 2009,

                                           63
driven mostly by lower food prices. However, the inflation rate was further fuelled on
account of the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in January 2010.
However, end of period inflation rose 17.8 percent in 2010. Prices of the local and
imported varieties of the major staple food, rice, increased by 12 percent and 14 percent
between 2010 and 2011 alone. The prices of a number of other food items also increased
sharply, notably bread, eggs, beef, edible oils, sugar, onions and flour. Price hikes for
food items and fuel drove inflation to reach high 17.82% in May 2011, but slowed down
to 15.7% in September 2011 on account of prudent fiscal and proactive monetary policies
undertaken by both Ministry of Finance and Economic Development and the Bank of
Sierra Leone. On the other hand, Interest rate on government securities gradually fell,
although commercial banks’ interest rates on overdrafts remained unchanged.

Revenue and Expenditure Performance

The GRGG/C operations came at a time when realistic domestic revenue projections
were marred by unpredictability as the global economic crisis loomed high. Due to lower
imports, a decline in mining activity, weaker corporate income, and revenue policy
slippages, the funding under the operations gave significant external boost to the ability
of NRA to generate domestic revenues. As a result, government domestic revenues as a
proportion of GDP increased to 11.7 percent of GDP in 2009 down from 10.8 percent in
2007 and subsequently rose to 13.3 percent of GDP in 2010. The overall fiscal balance in
2009 fell to -4.0 percent of GDP against the budget target of -3.5 percent of GDP, while
the domestic primary fiscal balance fell to -3.3 percent of GDP compared to the budget
target of -1.4 percent of GDP. The increased revenues were necessary as government
aimed to maintain macroeconomic stability while also expanding investment spending to
support the implementation of the Agenda for Change. The NRA was enabled to
undertake broad-based reforms, harmonized tariffs, reviewed the fiscal regime including
the introduction of the ASYCUDA ++, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in January
2010 and the establishment of the Domestic Tax Department, among several others.

The GRGG/C funds enabled Government to provide moderate stimulus in 2009 to 2010
to increase investment spending in improving urban and township roads and local council
infrastructure. Additional resources were given to NaCSA under the World Bank cash-
for-work program, including increased outlays under the counterpart contribution
window from the budget to help stimulated youth employment. Government was enabled
to increase investment under the Bumbuna Hydroelectric Power (BHP) programme to
improve the supply of low cost electricity generation, which in turn reduced urban
expenditures on fuelling generators, and spurring, as a secondary effect, increase urban
demand for rural products and help spur job creation.

External Sector Performance

The increased foreign exchange funds at BSL were made accessible to the private sector
through the Weekly Action window to support exports and imports of goods. As a result,
exports grew strongly, jumping from 2.9 percent in 2007 to 33.5 percent in 2010.
However, the value for mineral exports declined by 21.2 percent in 2008 and further by

                                           64
18.5 percent in 2009. Export earnings, especially diamonds, dampened due to the global
economic and financial crises and the fall in output.

Imports growth ebbed and fell reflecting the wide movements in the international prices
for food and fuel products. The US$ value of total imports increased by 2.2 percent and
24.8 percent in 2007 and 2008 respectively, and dropped by 2.6 percent in 2009,
following a sharp fall in the value of food and fuel imports as prices moderated in the
year. Imports grew by 12.3 percent marked by higher fuel imports and the import of
machinery and transport equipment to support the increased agriculture and mining
activities.

A noticeable drop in inward remittances and exports created a short supply in foreign
currency in 2009. Consequently, the Leone recorded 28 percent depreciation between
December 2008 and December 2009, but moderated by 2010. Thus, the nominal
exchange rate remained relatively stable during the program operational period of 2007-
2010.

A healthy reserves position was attained at 6.5 months of import by end 2009 from 4.5
months of import in 2007. In 2010, gross reserves increased in nominal terms to
US$338.5 million but in months of import, it declined to 5.2 months.

Progress achieved in structural reforms

As part of the multi-donor program support, Government pursued the implementation of
a number of structural and institutional reforms under the GRGG/C programme. This
includes the following:

Public Financial Management

The GRGG/C operations enabled Government to intensify efforts to develop and
strengthen the legal and regulatory framework governing public financial management.
In this regard, a comprehensive review of Integrated Public Financial Management
Reforms Project (IPFMRP) was undertaken, including review of the National Public
Procurement Act (2004) and the Government Budgeting and Accountability Act (2005)
and their constituent regulations to maintain them at speed with emerging developments
and challenges. An external assessment of the our public financial management (PFM)
systems in the Central Government and local councils conducted in 2010 using Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) methodology revealed that significant
improvements have been made in PFM systems in Sierra Leone.

As part of these reforms, the public procurement process has significant improved. Good
quality procurement plans are being prepared by MDAs; public procurements that go
through competitive bidding have increased exponentially, providing better opportunity
for increase volumes and value. Equally, a cadre of procurement professionals has been
established in the civil service and procurement specialists have been recruited and
deployed in key MDAs.

                                          65
In a bid to foster commitment controls and ease processing public financial transactions,
the roll-out process of the Integrated Public Financial Management Information System
(IFMIS) has covered up to 11 MDAs. Training and support to IFMIS users across MDAs
continue to be provided. To strengthen the financial management capacity in the local
councils, the PETRA Accounting package - a financial management information system -
has been rolled out to 8 local councils. Mayor/chairpersons and Chief Administrators
together with their respective Deputies have received training in executive financial
management practices.

The Auditor-General’s report on Public Accounts for both the central and local
governments is now laid in Parliament on record time. Government has made significant
headway in strengthening internal audit functions and the deployment of personnel
qualified auditors across government. Government has been implementing the Public
Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS) to ascertain the proportion of disbursed public
resources that reach the intended beneficiaries, resulting in remarkable improvement in
the efficiency of public service delivery.

Public Sector Reforms

Major reforms geared towards increasing effectiveness and productivity in the public
service was undertaken in the period under review. Government launched the Multi-
Donor Funded Public Sector Reform Programme Phase II with the overarching objective
of strengthening and improving capacity in the public service. The Human Resources
Management Office (HRMO) has been created to replace the Establishment Secretary’s
Office. HRMO implements strategies to achieve comprehensive pay reforms, obtain a
lean, performance-oriented, well-motivated, modern and efficient civil service to
optimize public service delivery. The outdated General Orders has been replaced with
the revised Codes, Rules and Regulations of the Civil Service, including new
Administrative Manual comprising regulations.

Government has introduced bio-metric verification of payrolls in MDAs to address the
problem of incomplete and inaccurate personnel records and database, and drastically
reduce the opportunity for payroll fraud. The measure has so far resulted in the reduction
of the civil service payroll from 16,000 to 12,000 and associated salary savings of Le500
millions per month. The verification of the health sector payroll has also been
successfully completed. The issue about lack of integrity in the teachers’ payroll which
constitutes 50% of public employees and incomplete personnel records and personal
database as well as the existence of anomalous files is also being addressed. Files have
been created for all 35,505 teachers. A physical verification of all teachers is underway
aimed at bringing credibility in the teachers’ payroll and updating records in teachers’
files and reconciling all files with the master file held by HRMO and with the IFMIS.

Stocked with the perennial problem of provide reliable electricity and water at affordable
cost, Government embarked on capacity building in the Ministry of Energy and Water
Resources through donor assistance. The reform include revision of the tariff structure
for electricity, as well as unbundling the services provided by the Ministry to include the

                                            66
creation of the Electricity and Water Regulation Commission (EWR), an Electricity
Generation Company, an Electricity Distribution Company and an Energy Asset
Commission. The reform aims at removing the technical and administrative rigidities that
debar effective service delivery of electricity and water supplies in the country.

Business Environment Reforms

Government over the years took proactive steps to introduce policy-oriented initiatives to
improve the business regulatory environment and remove administrative barriers to
attract domestic and foreign investors. To help boost private investment and encourage
firms to join the formal sector, Parliament, in July 2007, approved legislation that
significantly reduced the complexity and cost of business registration (the General Law
on Business Start-Ups and Registration of Business Act). In order to modernize the
financial transactions, Government adopted the Payment Systems Act (2008), the
Securities Act (2008), the Companies Act (2009),the bankruptcy Act (2009), a venture
capital scheme, and the Anti-Money Laundering and Criminalization of Terrorism Act
(2011). In 2009, the Private Sector Development Strategy was launched aimed at
unleashing the potential of indigenous enterprises to take advantage of the county’s
economic growth. In 2010, His Excellency, the President launched the National Export
Strategy prepared by the Sierra Leone Investment and Export Promotion Agency
(SLIEPA) with the sponsorship of the Commonwealth Secretariat. The Public-Private
Partnership (PPP) law was also passed into law in 2010 which aims at encouraging
private sector participation in the delivery of public services. A fast-track commercial
court was established to settle commercial disputes in courts quicker and easier. A
comprehensive National Land Policy has been formulated to reform the regulatory and
administrative systems surrounding land tenure, ownership and sale. Significant
investments have also been made in improving basic infrastructure and social services to
reduce the costs of doing business.

Consequently, Sierra Leone today has steadily moved up the rankings in the influential
World Bank “Ease of Doing Business? Index. Sierra Leone is on record as one of the top
four countries for ease of doing business in ECOWAS and among the only 10 economies
globally that have made significant improvements in four areas of regulation, i.e. getting
credit (credit information), trade across borders, enforcing contracts, and resolving
insolvency. Sierra Leone’s doing business ranking for 2012 rankings has markedly
improved by 11 points to 141 out of 183 countries, up from 150 in 2011, making it an
investment destination.

Financial Sector Reforms

A Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP) was adopted by Government in August
2009 upon the recommendation of 2006/7 IMF World Bank Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP). This plan repositioned Bank of Sierra Leone in its rightful place in
financial sector reforms to respond to government vision outlined in the Agenda for
Change.


                                           67
As part of the FSDP, a Credit Reference Bureau was established in 2011 in an effort to
reduce credit risks in the banking system and increase the chances for bank lending to the
public for investment activities. Rural financial intermediation has received significant
boost as a number of deposits and non-deposit taking Micro Finance Institutions have
been licensed, including the increasing number of Financial Services Associations
involved in agricultural credit.

Effective banking supervision is underway in BSL substantiated by the revision of the
banking Act (2000) and the Bank of Sierra Leone Act (2000) to ensure compliance with
international standards.

Overall Impact

Macroeconomic performance has been strengthened on several fronts except for
achieving lower inflation rate due largely to the adverse impact on the domestic economy
of the global economic and financial crises. Interest rates and the exchange rate remain
market-driven. Real interest rates are positive while the exchange rate remains relatively
stable. While prospects for mining revenues remain bright, continued development
partners’ assistance in relative terms remain strong to support the availability of official
foreign exchange through an auction system by the Bank of Sierra Leone to provide for
private sector-led investment activities.

The government budgeting and planning exercise includes factoring an estimated
programme external budget support inflows in the nation budget profile following
discussions with donors. As stated earlier, Government domestic revenues as a proportion
of GDP have steadily increased from 10.8 percent of GDP in 2007, 11.5 percent of GDP
in 2008, 11.8 percent of GDP in 2009, 13.3 percent of GDP in 2010 and estimated to rise
further to 14.9 percent in 2011.

Total Expenditures and Net lending have trended upwards from 20.7 percent of GDP in
2008, 22.9 percent of GDP in 2009, 24.5 percent of GDP in 2010 and estimated to rise to
25.8 percent of GDP in 2011.

Sustainability

Backed by continuous and sustained donor budget support in the medium term and the
prospect of increase revenue in-take from the mining sector by the 10 largest mining
companies operating in the country, the availability of foreign exchange made available
through the BSL auction system to provide for private sector-led investment activities
will be sustained.

Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

The technical delays in the disbursement of programmed external inflows led to a
substantial reduction in the orderly supply of foreign exchange to the weekly Foreign


                                            68
Exchange Auction. Nonetheless, as stated above, increased foreign reserves coupled with
prudent economic policies moderated pressure on the exchange rate.

On the domestic front, weak capacity in the implementing agencies including domestic
revenue shortfalls by NRA affected the desired impact on the economy.

Lessons Learnt

Communication through regular monthly meetings with ministries, departments and
agencies (MDAs) and visitations made strengthened and deepened commitment to
provided information for reporting purposes on agreed benchmarks. The catalytic role of
the Economic Policy and Research Unit of the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Development in monitoring, implementation and reporting of agreed reforms with
development partners was able to largely give desired outcomes.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the GRGG/C helped to make available foreign currency for imports of
essential commodities, preserve the fiscal space needed for poverty reduction while
limiting domestic bank financing that should have occurred had the funds not been
received, promote efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public
resources, improve the investment climate and promote exports, and achieve progress in
the poverty reduction strategy against a slowdown associated with the global economic
and financial crises.

The GRGG/C also helped to create the room for the reduction in the tariff rates for
essential commodities like rice, wheat, flour, sugar and fuel which ensured that pass-
through effect of higher international commodity prices was lower than the counter-
factual.

The implementation of the agreed structural and institutional reforms strengthened
government’s capacity in optimizing public service delivery.
