INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
FOR THE TERRES NEUVES II RESETTLEMENT AND EASTERN SENEGAL
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed dev-
elopment credit to the Republic of Senegal for the equivalent of US$2.0 mil-
lion to help finance a resettlement and technical assistance project that is
a follow-up to credit 254-SE of June 18, 1971. The credit would be on
standard IDA terms.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Economy of Senegal" (212-SE) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on September 10, 1973. Country data appear in
Annex I.
Past Development
3.        During the 1960s, the Senegalese economy experienced virtual stagna-
tion, as real output increased less rapidly than population, and per capita
GNP declined. Two factors were responsible for this situation. First, with
Independence, Senegal lost its privileged position as the center of French
West Africa and therefore had to adjust to reduced economic, administrative,
and political dimensions. Secondly, the difficulties of adaptation to the
new situation were compounded in the latter part of the decade when ground-
nut production fell by 50 percent due to unfavorable weather and falling
export prices. In 1971, a combination of several favorable factors includ-
ing the recovery of weather conditions, increased incentives for rural pro-
duction, promising results of rural diversification, and a successful drive
to promote industrial exports seemed to mark the beginning of a period of
considerably higher growth. As it turned out, the economic upturn was
brief, as 1972 brought the Sahel's most severe drought in this century.
4.        In 1972, agricultural and livestock production fell by more than
25 percent, setting back the standard of living of the rural population
(representing 70 percent of the total) below the level reached in the early
1960s. Food emergency operations helped avoid widespread starvation, but
notwithstanding this aid, both the fiscal and balance of payments situations
sharply deteriorated in 1973 and early 1974.
5.        During 1973, the balance of payments situation was characterized
by substantial reserve losses. At the end of the year, total net reserves
stood at minus US$31 million, the lowest level since Independence. The main
underlying factors in 1973 were a sharp drop in groundnut production and
exports (somewhat mitigated by exceptionally high world market prices) and



-2-
a continued increase in imports, mainly of foodstuffs. Even unusually high
aid inflows, including substantial food aid, were not sufficient to finance
the deteriorating trade balance. In 1974, both imports and exports (goods
and non-factor services) increased markedly, by an estimated 45 and 73 percent
respectively, following rapidly rising prices and slightly higher quantities
of Senegal's major exports (groundnuts, phosphate and petroleum products) and
imports (food, petroleum and general imports). The more rapid climb in exports
resulted in a narrowing of the goods and non-factor services deficit from an
all-time high of US$88 million in 1973 to an estimated US$35 million in 1974,
which is about a normal figure for Senegal. Net private capital outflows
increased, however, to an exceptionally high figure of US$33 million. This
was largely due to:
i.   an increase in trade credits to finance exports;
ii.   accelerated repayments of private foreign debts; and
iii.   repatriation of equity capital after Government increased its
ownership of a number of foreign-owned corporations.
The phosphate mining company Taiba (in which Government increased its owner-
ship from 3% to 50%) alone transferred US$52 million on these accounts. Net
foreign reserves dropped further to a level of minus US$44 million at the end
of 1974. The worsening external position of Senegal obliged monetary authori-
ties to draw in December 1974 the US$5.8 million gold tranche with the IMF,
and in January 1975 the country's full US$19.2 million allocation under the
IMF oil facility.
6.        During 1972 and 1973, under the impact of the drought, public fin-
ances also took a serious turn for the worse. Public savings net of amortiza-
tion, which had substantially improved during the preceding years, were all but
wiped out in 1972/73 and 1973/74. Revenues were affected by the decline in
economic activity. Recurrent expenditures were further increased by a rise in
salaries to compensate for the rapidly increasing cost of living, substantially
higher debt service payments and perhaps most importantly, heavy consumer sub-
sidies which resulted from maintaining low domestic prices in the face of
skyrocketing food import prices. Thus, at mid-1974, :Ln spite of a US$46 million
higher transfer to the stabilization fund from groundnut sales than the pre-
vious year, the public finance situation was more difficult than it had been
since 1960.
Prospects
7.        Weather conditions will remain critical to Senegal's growth prospects.
But with the rapid development of irrigated agriculture which started in the
1960s, the agricultural development of areas less affected by rainfall fluctuations
(Casamance, Eastern Senegal) and substantial gains in industry, tourism and
fisheries, by 1980 weather conditions should be a less decisive factor than today.
The Fourth Development Plan (1973/74-1976/77) continues to give highest priority
to rural development (36 percent of the total), housing/public utilities (18
percent) and transport infrastructure (16 percent). Industry and tourism, quite



-3-
justifiably, see their share increase from 5 to 10 percent of the total.
Assuming average rainfall conditions, Senegal's growth in real terms in the
remainder of the 1970s will be of the order of 4.5 percent or about 2 percent
per capita, which is still a considerable improvement over the past decade.
8.        The balance of payments will continue to be under pressure during
1975, and will remain weak in the medium-term. In 1975, the effects of the
good 1974/75 harvest will be largely offset by the expected deterioration in
the terms of trade, due to a 20 to 25 percent fall in groundnut prices. This
may lead to a further fall in reserves of about US$15 million during the
year. For the period 1976-78, it is estimated that the terms of trade index
for Senegal will continue to fall, mainly as a result of an expected drop in
phosphate prices. Therefore, as no major increase in the export volume is
anticipated, Senegal's exports are expected to stagnate in the coming years.
After 1978, a new phosphate mine is planned to come into production, while
phosphate prices are expected to resume their upward trend. These prospects
combined with a favorable long-term outlook for groundnut production could
result in a healthier balance of payments position towards the end of the
seventies.
9.        Faced with the difficult situation in public finance, the Governme.7t
took a number of steps in November 1974 which are expected to put public
finances on a sounder footing. Consumer prices for rice, sugar, and groundnut
oil were raised to bring them more closely in line with world market prices.
Thus, the rice subsidy was completely eliminated (an increase of 70 percent
in the consumer price), the price of sugar was increased by 90 percent (leav-
ing a subsidy of about 20 percent) and that of groundnut oil was raised by
43 percent (leaving a subsidy of about 20 percent). However, high world
market prices for wheat required an increase in domestic flour prices which
the Government is reluctant to pass on to the consumer and which may lead
to a subsidy on bread. At the same time, when subsidies were reduced,
Government salaries were raised by 16 percent on the average, but ranging
from 60 percent for the lower salaries to 3 percent for the higher salaries,
to compensate for the rapid increase in basic food prices. Following the
five-fold increase in world market phosphate prices and the revision of the
tax agreement between the Government and the major phosphate mining company
in the country, Government revenues from this sector will be considerably
increased in the coming years. However, the good 1974/75 harvest is unlikely
to augment Government revenues because of the drop in groundnut prices. These
developments are expected to raise net public savings after debt service from
the low level of about US$5 million in FY75 to about US$35 million in FY76.
10.       During FY75 the increased domestic resources available to finance
public investment will be mostly absorbed by payments for the Government's
purchase of a 50 percent interest in the phosphate mining enterprise, which
is the main source of future additional income. In the following years
through 1980, projected trends in revenue and expenditure should permit the
generation of investable surpluses (after foreign debt service), equivalent to
20-25 percent of public investment, assuming the public development program



grows only slightly faster than the overall economy. Yet, there is considerable
scope to expand the development effort and to raise the share of public invest-
ment above its historically low level of 5-6 percent of GDP. Moreover, while
the improvement in domestic resource mobilization will ease the balance of
payments situation - particularly import demand - moderately, it will not be
enough to restore overall equilibrium in the medium-term. Given our assump-
tions on gross capital inflows, an annual overall gap in the balance of
payments averaging US$25 millLon a year will emerge in the years 1976/78.
Part of this gap could probabLy be financed through access to the IMF facilities
including the second oil facility, but additional foreign exchange resources
will still be needed. In sum, Senegal has taken important and commendable
steps to rationalize the structure of domestic consumer and producer prices,
and mobilize additional public savings. Yet, the economy remains vulnerable
because of its negative reserves, the volatility of world market conditions
for groundnuts, and the risks of drought. In view of these factors, external
lenders should be prepared to finance not only all foreign exchange costs but
also a high proportion of local costs of high priority projects, particularly
those which have a low foreign exchange component.
Creditworthiness
11.       The terms of foreign aid to Senegal have been progressively harden-
ing over the years. The proportion of grant aid declined from 85 percent in
the mid-sixties to 50 percent in FY72. Faced with a severe shortage of public
savings, the Government borrowed heavily on the Eurodollar market in the past
two years, in order to avoid a slowdown in public investments and to finance
acquisitions and participations by the public sector. Starting in FY74, this
led to a substantial increase in the public debt service which is expected
to absorb about 70 percent of public savings in FY75. This ratio should
decrease again in the coming years, following the marked improvement expected
in the public finance situation. Senegal's external debt service is still
very low, at about 5-6 percent of export revenues.   But because of low foreign
exchange reserves and heavy dependence on one crop, Senegal will have to remain
prudent in its public debt management. Indeed, further borrowing at commercial
terms during the years 1976 to 1978 would probably increase the ratio of debt
service to export earnings to about 7 percent and if the expected improvement
in terms of trade does not occur after 1978, the ratio would increase to above
10 percent by the end of the decade. This suggests that foreign aid should
continue to be given on highly concessionary terms.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SENEGAL
12.       The Bank Group has had 22 operations in Senegal to date.   Total
lending amounts to US$114 million (net of cancellations), including thirteen
IDA credits, four Bank loans, two blends of Bank and IDA funds, two IFC opera-
tions, and one blend of Bank and IFC funds. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of May 31, 1975
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.



- 5 -
13.       Execution of these projects, apart from the Railway Project and
the Site and Services Project, is moving forward without exceptional delays.
The procurement for the railway has been slow due to time consuming contract
approval procedures, but most project components have now been received or
ordered. The Site and Services Project is about one year behind schedule,
although physical execution is now progressing satisfactorily. Terracing of
the first sub-site for Dakar was finished in November 1974 with an unexpected
cost reduction. The Bank Group and Senegal held discussions recently on
delays in reorganizing the executing agency, Office des Habitations a Loyer
Modere (OHLM), and in implementing Government's commitment to reorient its
housing policy in favor of lower income groups. Some of the agricultural
projects, such as the First Terres Neuves Project and the Casamance Rice Pro-
ject, were hampered by delays in receiving the Government's counterpart
contribution; however, owing to efforts of the project authorities, physical
implementation of these projects is proceeding generally according to schedule.
Two agricultural credits (140-SE and 404-SE, para 21) provided for technical
assistance designed to facilitate the reorganization of the Office National de
Cooperation et d'Assistance au Developpement (ONCAD); while this program failed
to achieve meaningful results for some time, the Government recently took a
number of steps to strengthen ONCAD's management and financial operations (see
Annex II) and continues to consult with IDA on further measures to be taken.
14.       In view of Senegal's need for substantially higher capital inflows,
the scale of Bank Group lending is expected to increase significantly in the
future. The Bank Group share of foreign aid disbursements (including grants)
is expected to increase from about 6 percent in 1970-71 to 24 percent over the
1974-80 period. By then the Bank Group is likely to be the largest aid donor.
This will increase the Bank Group's share of the outstanding and disbursed debt
from 12 percent at the end of 1973 to about 25 percent by 1980. IBRD/IDA share
in public debt service will probably go up from 2.2 percent in 1973 to about
13 percent by 1980.
15.       The objectives of Bank Group project lending in Senegal fall under
four main headings. Priority will continue to be rural development, including
development of irrigation in the Senegal River Valley Region (e.g., the Debi-
Lampsar engineering credit recently signed), intensification of groundnut
production and diversification into new crops and new regions (e.g., the Sine
Saloum project recently signed and the proposed Eastern Senegal Livestock
Project, a proposed second stage of credit 252-SE in Casamance and the project
described in this report). As in the past, our agricultural lending is expected
to exceed one-third of the total. Secondly, we shall assist diversification of
the economy by lending for the growing sectors of tourism and industry (e.g.,
the proposed tourism infrastructure project on the Petite Cote and a possible
Ship Repair Project, based on studies financed under Loan S-3SE, since these
latter studies were undertaken, the market prospects for such a project have
been considerably altered by virtue of changes in the pattern of international
oil consumption, reopening and possible enlargement of the Suez Canal and other
developments affecting the number and size of ships that will require repair



- 6 -
facilities of the type envisaged -- these market prospects are now being reviewed).
Thirdly, we shall continue investment for modernizing and expanding the country's
infrastructure (e.g., two proposed highway projects and a proposed fishing wharf
at Dakar Port). Finally we shall continue lending to reorient and expand the
country's education system, as in the Second Education Project.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
16.       Agriculture plays a central role in Senegal's economy, employing
over 70 percent of the total labor force. Although it contributed only 38
percent of GDP in 1974, the sector's leverage on the economy is and will
remain considerable through its impact on exports and its purchasing power
for locally-produced goods and services. Groundnuts and millet are the
country's main agricultural products, and groundnuts are the country's princi-
pal export. During the last four years, groundnuts have comprised between 35
and 55 percent of total exports and generated about 60 percent of value-added
in the agricultural sector. Millet continues to be the staple food grain
although rice and wheat consumption are increasing rapidly, particularly in
urban areas. Since 1968 Senegal has suffered from a series of severe droughts
and in 1968, 1970 and 1972 abnormally large food imports were needed to meet
demand. The 1972 drought was the worst and during it agricultural and live-
stock production fell by more than 25 percent. Weather has been better in
the last two years, but even in years of normal rainfall, domestic agricultural
production meets only about 60 percent of the country's food requirements, and
food imports absorb 15-20 percent of total export earnings.
17.       A Bank Group sector mission visited Senegal in 1974 to assist the
Government in assessing the relative merits of its various agricultural
development options. The mission pointed out that scope for significant in-
creases in productivity and for developing a small farm structure capable of
generating acceptable incomes existed through harnessing the country's water
resources, primarily the Senegal River Valley, but also those of the Casamance
Region. However, the development of irrigation potential in Casamance and the
Senegal River Basin would not affect the Groundnut Basin and other areas of
the country which must continue to rely on rainfed agriculture and in which
the bulk of the population lives. For these areas, the sector mission con-
cluded that, by adopting currently available technology, incomes from a
typical rainfed farm can be increased by about 30 percent. Even with this
increase, farmer incomes and standards of living will remain low by any
criteria.
18.       Small-scale rainfed farming accounts for 95 percent of production.
There is a limited though increasing amount of irrigated development in the
Delta of the Senegal River and in the Casamance Region and commercial farming
is restricted to a few vegetable-growing operations and a large sugar cane
plantation in the Delta. The small farm sector consists of about 360,000
farms, most of which range in size from 3 to 10 hectares. The cropping pat-
tern is very similar throughout the country, with millet/sorghum and ground-
nuts each occupying about half of the cropped area. Simple animal-drawn



equipment is widely used and there is virtually no mechanized farming. Per
capita annual incomes from a typical farm average about US$85. Rural incomes
are significantly lower in the undeveloped areas of the Senegal River Valley,
the northern area of the Groundnut Basin and in the relatively undeveloped
area of Eastern Senegal. The use of improved seeds, fertilizers and pesticides
is slowly expanding assisted by government subsidies, but despite this, pro-
duction remains low because of poor soils and erratic rainfall and the country
is increasingly unable to feed its growing urban population. Imports of cereals
have amounted to 400,000 to 440,000 tons in recent years, of which 150,000 to
200,000 tons have been rice.
19.       Agricultural development potentials and population densities differ
between regions. In much of the north and east of the country, climatic con-
ditions are suitable only for extensive livestock production. The Senegal
River Valley has potential for irrigation development, but requires the con-
struction of major infrastructure to regulate the river. The bulk of the
rural population is concentrated within about 100 miles of Dakar in the
heavily populated Groundnut Basin where population densities vary from 20 to
SO/km . In this area the combination of population pressure, poor soils,
and low rainfall makes the potential for increasing production and incomes
limited. The potential for increasing and diversifying crop production is
greater to the south and southeast where rainfall is higher and more reliable.
Yet even in these areas, soils are generally shallow and pcor, and the
presence of river blindness puts a limitation on the population in the area.
20.       In the years immediately following Independence, Government assigned
low priority to the agriculture sector in allocating public investment and
recurrent expenditures. Since then, however, increasing priority has been
given to agriculture. Thus while only 4-6 percent of the current budget now
goes to agriculture, the sector's share of the investment budget has increased
steadily and currently amounts to between 20 and 25 percent. In November 1974
Government raised the producer prices for groundnuts (by 40 percent), millet
and sorghum (7 percent), rice (20 percent) and cotton (55 percent) as incen-
tives to their increased production. The consumer subsidy for imported rice
(which cost the Government about US$30 million in 1973/74) was abolished at
the same time. These actions illustrate Government's determination to increase
domestic production and reduce reliance on imports of food.
21.       Credit 404-SE provides for annual consultations between IDA and the
Government on the level of fertilizer subsidies. A consultation was held in
April 1975 during negotiations of the Sine Saloum Project. The Government
confirmed that its policy was to raise progressively prices for fertilizers
to market levels as a means of ensuring their efficient use. An agreement
was reached that consultations between the Government and the Bank would be
held in October/November of each year to discuss the price for the following
campaign.



-8-
22.       Two Bank Group projects (140-SE, 404-SE) have provided medium-term
credit through the National Development Bank of Senegal to help farmers pur-
chase draft animals, animal-drawn equipment and fertilizer. In May 1975 the
Bank Group approved a project for Sine Saloum, the southern part of the Ground-
nut Basin, to diversify and improve farm practices. The First Terres Neuves
Project (254-SE) was a pilot scheme to test the feasibility of settling farmers
in the southeast of the country where climatic conditions are more favorable
than in the Groundnut Basin. The project proposed in this report would build
on the experience gained during the implementation of the first project, and
would provide for the continuation of the resettlement and for a plan covering
the period 1980-85 to develop the rural sector of eastern Senegal with a view
to ensure that settlers, established farmers and livestock owners make full
use of the region's relatively reliable rainfall. In the interim, the Govern-
ment has asked for financial assistance from the Bank Group over the period
1975-80 for a livestock development project in Eastern Senegal that was pre-
pared under a Bank executed UNDP technical assistance project. A Bank mission
visited Senegal to appraise this project in May-June 1975.
23.       The Casamance Project (252-SE) is improving extension and credit
services to 5,000 farmers in order to expand rice cultivation by 12,000 ha.
Government has indicated its desire to expand the scope of this successful
project and a follow-up project will be appraised later this year. The Bank
Group has also assisted the private sector by financing through IFC a fertili-
zer factory (SIES), and a small irrigated truck farmer operation producing
vegetables for the export market (BUD Senegal).
24.       Regulation of the Senegal River in order to permit irrigated develop-
ment is being sought jointly by Senegal, Mauritania and Mali within the Organi-
zation for the Development of the Senegal River Basin (OMVS). OMVS, helped
by UNDP, has prepared an ambitious, long-range development program that ulti-
mately could permit development of year-round irrigation on 430,000 ha along
the river of which about 220,000 ha would be in Senegal. The program would
also include power generation and improvement of navigation on the river.
Two potential regulatory dams have been studied by OMVS: a multipurpose dam
at Manantali, Mali, and the Delta Dam at Diama, Senegal. Although some parts
of the OMVS program as recently conceived may be overly ambitious, the over-
all concept is sound and obviously of very high priority, and the Bank has
been actively reviewing with other donors the merits and feasibility of the
entire program since July 1974. Planning for irrigation projects is already
starting, and IDA approved the Debi-Lampsar Irrigation Engineering Project
in April 1975. It will provide engineering and related studies for 5,000 ha
of double-cropping, using waters during the dry season from the Diama reservoir
as soon as the dam becomes operational, as now planned, in about 1980.



-9-
PART IV: THE PROJECT
25.       In 1969, the Government of Senegal asked IDA to help finance a reset-
tlement project providing for the migration of 1,000 families from heavily pop-
ulated areas of Senegal's Groundnut Basin to less populated areas of Eastern
Senegal. Following appraisal of the project in 1970, the Government and IDA
agreed in 1971 under Credit 254-SE (US$1.3 million) to implement a pilot re-
settlement scheme, involving some 300 settler families, and to prepare a larger
second phase project.
26.       The pilot project has shown that resettlement can be viable and in
June 1974, the Government proposed to the Association a second phase project
involving the resettlement of 2,000 families. However, the appraisal mission
found from reconnaissance soil surveys and information supplied by the consul-
tants, that there was insufficient vacant land in Eastern Senegal with suitable
soils for settlement on the scale envisaged by the Government. Moreover, in the
future, vacant land is most likely to be found in scattered pockets near existing
villages. Spot checks made by the Ministry of Health revealed also that 20 to
60 percent of the established populations near some of the sites proposed for
new settlements have symptoms of onchocerciasis (river blindness).   Thus, ti.e
Association could only recommend further settlement by at most 600 families in
the vicinity of the pilot project area which is safe for resettlement.
27.       In July 1974, an IDA mission appraised the project.   Negotiations
were held in Washington from May 27 to June 2, 1975. The Senegalese delegation
was led by Mr. Sih Sarr, Director of Financing of the Plan, Ministry of
Planning and Cooperation.
28.       An appraisal report No. 685a-SE is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors. Annex III provides a credit and project summary, and the
attached maps (IBRD 3110R and 11273) show the project area.
The Project Area
29.       The project area covers the administrative region of Eastern
Senegal comprising about 60,000 km2, of which 30,000 km2 have been set aside
for national forests and the large national park of Niokolo Koba. A good and
relatively reliable rainfall ranging from 600 mm to 1,500 mm, and a small pop-
ulation totalling some 200,000 rural inhabitants are the region's main positive
features; a lack of infrastructure, poor soils and the incidence of river blind-
ness are its principal drawbacks. Poor water supplies for human and animal
consumption have been a major obstacle to voluntary migration of farmers and
to cattle-raising. Eastern Senegal's 35,000 farms produce 40 percent of
Senegal's cotton and support cattle herds numbering some 300,000 head.

Project Description
30.       The project would continue settlement in an area of some 900 km    in
and adjacent to the pilot project area, and prepare a master plan for the region,
including investment proposals for an integrated regional agricultural develop-
ment project. The resettlement component would make full use of the infra-
structure constructed for the pilot project, and test variations of settlement
techniques that would be appropriate for future resettlement activities. The
master plan would provide the basis for investment proposals for a project to
commence in about 1980 when Government's ongoing and planned projects are due
to terminate. This plan would determine the prospects for continuing resettle-
ment in Eastern Senegal, and ensure that established farmers and livestock
owners make the best use of the region's relatively good rainfall.
31.       During the four-year implementation period 1976-79, the project
would:
(a) establish nine new villages for 450 settler families,
and install 150 families in existing villages;
(b) construct eight settlement officer houses, nine
stores, 12 classrooms, 76 km of village access tracks,
and 25 km of secondary roads;
(c) construct nine wells for new villages and rehabili-
tate about 15 wells for existing villages accepting
settlers;
(d) provide settlers with tools and grants for manual land
clearing, subsistence allowances, and credit facilities
for agricultural inputs and mechanical land clearing;
(e) provide farm extension services; and
(f) provide the staff and consultant services required
to prepare a regional plan, and investment proposals
for the development of the agricultural sector in
Eastern Senegal.
Resettlement Component
32.       Resettlement would follow most of the arrangements established by the
pilot scheme, with three important exceptions. First, 150 families would be
settled in existing villages to test whether this could be a satisfactory
method of settlement for the future that could make use of the small but scattered
pockets of vacant land (paragraph 26). Second, to reduce costs and ensure that
settlers contribute fully to the development of their holdings, the project
would encourage settlers to clear their holdings entirely by hand or to repay the



- 11 -
cost of mechanical clearing instead of each receiving 2 ha of land mechanically
cleared free of charge -- the practice established by the pilot scheme. Finally,
to encourage the removal of stumps and roots, a requirement for promoting improved
cultivation techniques and land use, settlers would be allocated 4 ha of land on
installation and the balance of their 10 ha holdings only as their land is
properly cleared.
Organization and Management
33.       Government is planning to establish a regional development agency
for Eastern Senegal, but has not finalized its plans for the agency nor decided
the future roles of Societe des Terres Neuves (STN) and Societe pour le Develop-
pement des Fibres Textiles (SODEFITEX) in the region. However, as STN will
continue to be responsible for resettlement, it would have primary responsibility
for implementing the project. As for the pilot project, STN would recruit and
transport settlers; install settlers in new and existing villages; provide
tools and payments for land clearing, subsistance allowances, and agricultural
credit on behalf of Banque Nationale de Developpement du Senegal (BNDS); and
arrange for mechanical land clearing and for the construction of wells, roads,
tracks, stores, classrooms and staff housing. During the first year of the
project, while government considers its plans for a regional development agency,
STN would obtain assistance from SODEFITEX to provide settlers with agricul-
tural extension services. For this purpose, it would sign a contract with
SODEFITEX with terms and conditions acceptable to the Association. At the end
of this contract, Government would review and agree with the Association
arrangements for continuing agricultural extension services to settlers. The
review would take account of Government's latest plans for the regional agency,
and of the effectiveness of the contract between STN and SODEFITEX. Future
arrangements w-uld not preclude a renewal of this contract, should this be
considered the most effective solution for the project. (See Section 3.01(c)
of the draft Credit Agreement.) It would be a condition of effectiveness that
STN and SODEFITEX had signed a contract covering agricultural extension services
for the first project year. (See Section 6.01(a) of the draft Credit Agree-
ment.)
Regional Planning and Technical Assistance
34.       No attempt has been made by the Government to coordinate planning
in the region. As a consequence, projects have been implemented in isola-
tion, and Government departments and agencies have not coordinated their
activities. However, as investments in the region have been relatively small,
this lack of coordination and planning has not affected ongoing projects.
Yet with the evidence that land for agricultural development may not be in
plentiful supply and with the increased development activity planned for
livestock owners and farmers, plus the Government's desire to continue re-
settlement, effective land use planning and resource management are becoming
critical issues in Eastern Senegal.



- 12 -
35.       The project's regional planning activities would be carried out in
two stages. In the first stage, the project would help the Government pre-
pare a draft master plan that would bring together and analyze information
on the region including health surveys, recommend a development strategy,
and provide draft terms of reference for the preparation of investment propo-
sals. In the second stage, the project would help the Government prepare
detailed investment proposals for a project suitable for external financing.
The latter would be undertaken only upon agreement between the Government and
the Association on the draft for a regional plan and on the terms of reference
for the preparation of investment proposals prepared by the Ministry of Plan-
ning. The project would help the Ministry of Planning carry out the surveys
and studies first by seeking technical assistance from the World Health Organ-
ization (WHO) concerning the health survey and analysis of the problems that
river blindness and other diseases may pose for development; and second by
employing consultants financed by the project to prepare the plan and invest-
ment proposals.
Project Cost and Financing
36.       Project ,   c i estimated at US$3.4 million net of taxes.  Total
project cost, includin.g about US$0.5 million in taxes, would be US$3.9 million.
Costs include a foreign exchange component of US$1.4 million, or 42 percent
of the cost net of taxes. Physical contingencies and expected price in-
creases would amount to 26 percent of total base cost estimates, which are
at mid-1975 prices. The proposed IDA credit of US$2.0 million would cover
the foreign exchange costs and US$580,000, or 23 percent, of local currency
costs for a total of 59 percent of total costs net of taxes and duties. The
remaining local costs totaling US$1.94 million would be met from government
budgetary alloce-'ons (US$1.38 million), by BNDS (US$0.47 million), and by
settlers (US$0.09 million).
37.       The IDA credit, together with most of Government's contributions,
would be deployed as follows:
(a)  CFAF 445.1 million (US$1.98 million) as a grant to
STN to cover the cost of civil works (CFAF 153.0
million) , mechanical land clearing (CFAF 45.0 million),
vehicles for STN and manual land clearing tools for
settlers (CFAF 18.0 million), salaries and operating
expenses (CFAF 148.1 million), and settler recruitment
and installation (CFAF 81.0 million);
(b)  CFAF 82.8 million (US$0.37 million) to the Ministry
of Planning for the regional plan to cover the costs
of consultants (CFAF 70.8 million) and counterpart
staff (CFAF 12.0 million); and
(c) CFAF 205,3 million (IJS$0.91 million) as an unallocated
reserve.



- 13 -
Incremental on-farm costs would be financed as follows: Government would provide
CFAF 27.2 million (US$0.12 million) in the form of a fertilizer subsidy; BNDS
would finance short and medium-term credit expected to total CFAF 105.8 million
(US$0.47 million); and settlers would contribute the equivalent of CFAF 19.1
million (US$0.09 million) representing the upkeep for oxen and implements.
Agricultural Credit Arrangements
38.       Under the pilot project, cotton inputs were financed and cotton
was marketed under a national package program introduced by the Cotton
was marketed under a national package program introduced by the Cotton
Development Company of France (CFDT) and now managed by SODEFITEX. STN was
responsible for credit management, input supplies and marketing for crops other
than cotton. This arrangement has worked satisfactorily and would be contin-
ued in the second project during the first two years of the settler's installa-
tion. During this period, however, STN would work with representatives of ONCAD
and with the settlers to establish cooperatives that would enable the settlers
to participate in the Agricultural Credit Program (PA), and thus eliminate the
need for STN to maintain a long involvement in providing credit to settlers.
The Government has not worked out the details for transferring STN's responsi-
bilities to cooperatives for input supply, credit and marketing in either the
pilot or the second project. The Government would consult with the Associa-
tion on the details and the timing for the transfer during the first year of
project implementation. (See Section 4.05 of the draft Credit Agreement.)
39.       In the meantime, BNDS would channel credit to settlers through STN.
The requirements during the four-year project period for short-term credits
for fertilizers, seeds and insecticides, and medium-term credits for draft
oxen and implements would total CFAF 105.8 million. STN would guarantee repay-
ments as long as it maintains control of groundnut marketing.   STN would also
be responsible for determining the value and collecting repayments of the long-
term credits for mechanical land clearing. Short, medium, and long-term credit
would bear interest at 2% above the Central Bank rediscount rate (currently
5.5%). Seasonal loans would be repaid in 9 months and medium-term loans over
a maximum of 5 years with a minimum grace period of one year. Long-term loans
would be repaid over 10 to 15 years with a grace period up to three years.
Procurement
40.       Most expenditures for project buildings, roads, wells, mechanical land
clearing, vehicles and equipment totalling about US$1.7 million would be spread
over three years and would include a variety of items that prevent bulking to
make contracts attractive to international bidders. Contracts for three wells
required in 1975, totalling US$0.1 million, would be awarded on the basis of
competitive bidding advertised locally in accordance with local procedures
which are satisfactory to the Association. Because of their small number and
the high cost of works undertaken by local contractors, alternative arrange-
ments would be followed for the other items: feeder roads and village access
tracks (US$0.6 million) would be constructed and improved by the Ministry of
Works or the Army Engineering Corps, six wells would be constructed and 15



- 14 -
improved (US$0.3 million) by Government well building brigades; low cost
village stores and junior staff housing (US$0.2 million) would be constructed
with direct labor employed and materials purchased by STN; and mechanical land
clearing (US$0.5 million) would be carried out on force account using Govern-
ment owned and operated equipment. Contracts for vehicles and equipment
(US$0.1 million) would be awarded on the basis of local suppliers' quotations.
Farm inputs (US$0.6 million) would be supplied by ONCAD. The remaining project
costs comprise personnel and management expenditures (US$0.8 million) and grants
and allowances to settlers (US$0.4 million) that would be unsuitable for compe-
titive bidding. Consultant services (US$0.3 million) would be obtained accord-
ing to the Association's normal procedures.
Disbursements
41.       The proceeds of the development credit would be disbursed to cover:
(a) 80% of the total cost of civil works (US$544,000);
(b) 60% of the local cost of vehicles and land clearing
tools or, if they are imported for the project,
100% of the foreign exchange cost (US$48,000);
(c) 80% of the total cost of mechanical land clearing
(US$160,000);
(d) 80% of personnel costs of STN and SODEFITEX
(US$318,000);
(e) 100% of the foreign cost of consultant services
(US$320,000);
(f) 80% of the total personnel costs for the Ministry
of Planning counterpart staff (US$42,000); and
(g) US$568,000 would be kept unallocated.
Marketing Arrangements
42.       The incremental production of groundnuts, cereals, and cotton would
be very small compared to Senegal's total output of these crops, and would
not have a great impact on the markets. All project cereals are expected to
have a ready local market. ONCAD has a marketing monopoly for groundnuts,
which it buys through cooperatives and sells to domestic processors; SODEFITEX
has a marketing monopoly for cotton and operates its own ginneries. Govern-
ment sets producer prices for cotton and groundnuts which, at present levels,
provide good incentives to project farmers; all of the project's production
of these two crops would have a ready domestic or export market.

Benefits and Justification
43.       Without the possibility of migration offered by the project, many
settlers would have been landless and dependent on relatives and friends
for their subsistence.  For hicse settlers the project would provide otherwise
unobtainable income opportunities.   The net value of farm production, including
the food consuned by the fa m.ily, would rise from about US$400 to about US$1,300
between Year 1 and Year 10 of participation for families moving to new villages,
and from about US$300 to about US$1,100 for families moving to eristing villages.
During the same period settler families are expected to increase from 5 to 10
members, mainly as a result of continued migration of relatives from the de-
parture area and consequently per capita incomes are expected to increase
from about US$80 to about US$130 and from about US$70 to about US$110,
respectively. Prior to their departure, the per capita incomes of settlers
would mostly be amongst the lowest 25 percent of the rural population and
would be between US$30 and US$70.  Hence the project would provide settlers
with adequate financial incentives.
44.       The project tod increase the annual output of seed cotton by about
1,500 tons, of unshelled groundnuts by 2,800 tons, and of cereals by 3,500 tons.
It would improve the livelihood of 6,000 members of settler families, and
would contribute about CFAF 300 million (US$1.3 million) net annually to
Senegal's foreign exchange earnings. The project roads, water supply and
social infrastructure imaprovements would also benefit about 10,000 members of
existing farm families in the project area.
45.       The economic rate of return would be about 14%.   The calculations
are based on the Bank's price projections for groundnuts, cotton and cereals.
Costs include all expenditures on infrastructures, settler recruitment, trans-
portation, installation, supervision, farm inputs and family labor costed at
the value of production oL a family engaged in subsistence agriculture.   Whien
family labor is costed at zero the rate of return is 20%. Benefits take
account of the probability of a drought occuring in 1 out of 4 years. An
overall reduction of benefits of 25%, or an increase in capital costs of 15%,
would lower the rate of return respectively by 7 and 3 percentage points. In
view of the experience gained in the pilot project, the risk that benefits
would fall by 25% is low unless world market prices fall much more than ex-
pected, and cost overruns are unlikely to exceed 15%. Therefore, the project
is expected to have a satisfactory rate of return.
46.       The project's pre-investment components would permit the Government
to make detailed plans for the development of Eastern Senegal for the period
1980-85. They would determine the scope for further resettlement in Eastern
Senegal and would assess the extent of the threat to the region posed by river
blindness. Effective development of the resources and potential of Eastern
Senegal can be accomplished only with complete information on such issues.

Cr. No. 252     Casamance Rice Project; US$3.7 Million
Credit of June 19, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Good management and adequate rainfall during the last campaign ensured
good crops for groundnut and rice, which were well above appraisal estimates.
The number of farmers participating in the project is expanding at a faster
pace than anticipated and their response is good. Housing and offices will be
commissioned by June 1975, six months behind schedule. The road improvement
program is in progress, but most of the improvement of bottomland for rice
cultivation probably will not be implemented, because of lack of funds and of
technical expertise. The project has incurred some cost overruns, mainly
because extension staff were increased to cope with good farmers' response, and
because of salary increases. In addition, changes in the US$ exchange rate
will cause a loss equivalent to US$900,000. As a result, the project will be
short of funds at the end of 1975, instead of 1976. Government has asked the
Bank Group to finance a new project in the same area starting early CY 1976.
Terms of reference for the preparation of this second project have been agreed
upon by Government and IDA and the feasibility study report is being prepared
by the project management unit. RMWA is coordinating preparation, and appraisal
is tentatively scheduled for September, 1975.
Cr. No. 253    Technical and Agricultural Education Project; US$2.0 Million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Closing Date: October 1, 1976
Several changes in the architectural design of the main construc-
tion component of the project and the resulting delays in the procurement of
furniture and equipment made it necessary in June 1973 to lengthen by about
six months the original implementation and disbursement schedule. Implemen-
tation is now within the revised schedule and progressing well. The initial
delays in implementation, the effect of the US dollar devaluation, and recent
abnormal price increases all result in a cost overrun of about US$500,000.
Cr. No. 254    Terres Neuves Settlement Project; US$1.35 Million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project's settlement program was completed in 1974 as antici-
pated at appraisal. Adequate and evenly distributed rainfall ensured good
crops last season. The project has been successful in providing higher
incomes than expected for settlers and has attracted families with more adult
workers than anticipated in 1974. STN (the State Corporation in charge of
the project) has taken over project management from the management agency
agreed upon at appraisal. This change, together with personnel shifts, have
caused managerial and administrative problems that are not yet solved. The
project's accounts have been audited recently. Government's contribution to
project costs has been paid in full, and the previous financial difficulties
encountered by the project are now overcome.

Ln. 835-SE/Cr. 314/SE         Second Railway Project:   US$3.2 Million and
US$6.4 Million Credit and Loan of June 23,
1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
Initial planning and ptocurement were slow but procurement for
track renewal is now complete and about 90 percent of equipment for work-
shop rehabilitation has been ordered. Construction and track renewal is
expected to start soon about a year behind schedule. Poor management, in-
adequate use of locomotives, lack of spare parts and cumbersome financial
restrictions have prevented the railway from satisfying the demand in
Senegal for rail transportation. However, in the last six months Government
has taken measures to assist the railway, including tariff increases, sub-
sidies for unprofitable lines and a study to reorganize technical assis-
tance; the railway had its first positive cash flow in many years in
1973/74. At Government's request US$1.5 million was reallocated under the
project for the immediate rehabilitation of locomotive power and rolling
stock and for other high priority investment items in order to increase
the railways capacity, particularly to carry phosphates for export and in-
ternational traffic to Mali.
Cr. No. 336    Site and Services Project; US$8.0 Million
Credit of September 29, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Although credit effectiveness was delayed, physical implementation
of the project is now proceeding well. Terracing of the first sub-site for
Dakar was finished in November 1974 and preparation for the second sub-site
is underway. However, major problems remain regarding the reorganization of
the executing agency, Office des Habitations a Loyer Modere (OHLM), and it has
been difficult so far to find suitable counterparts for the expatriate technical
assistance team. Selection of occupants is underway for the first tranche of
the project although several problems in the application cf selection criteria
remain to be solved. In addition, Government's commitment to reorient substan-
tially its housing policy in favor of lower income groups has not been entirely
fulfilled. The last supervision mission discussed with Government and OHLM
officials these various problems, including Government policy towards housing
and the execution of the project in light of its original objectives.
Ln. No. 866    Telecommunications Project; US$6.25 Million
Loan of December 19, 1972; Closing Date:   June 30, 1976
The project is part of the 1973-1976 telecommunications rehabilitation
and development program of OPTS (Senegalese postal and telecommunications organ-
ization). It provides for the expansion and modernization of local and long
distance facilities in Dakar and in the northern region of Senegal. The project
is about 18 months behind schedule mainly due to delays in the appointment of
engineering consultants, in preparation of the bidding documents, and in pro-
curement. Moreover, project costs have increased from US$8.9 million (including
US$6.8 million foreign exchange) at appraisal, to US$20.3 million (including



ANNEX II
Page 5
US$13.2 million foreign exchange). This cost overrun is due to delay, unforeseen
inflation, lack of international competition, changes in design, and changes in
exchange rates. To finance part of this cost overrun, the Borrower applied to
and obtained from Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) a loan of
US$3.8 million and made arrangements to obtain suppliers' credits for another
US$3.8 million.
Ln. No. 867    Airport Project; US$3.0 Million
Loan of December 19, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
Work on the extension of the Dakar Airport runway is scheduled to
be completed by the end of June 1975 as forecast. Total cost is expected to
be within appraisal estimates although the borrower may be faced with addi-
tional costs due to the lower rate of exchange of the US dollar.
Cr. No. 350    River Polders Project; US$4.5 Million
Credit of January 9, 1973; Closing Date; December 31, 1977
Procurement has been completed for the main components of the project
and contracts have been awarded. Construction of works is progressing satis-
factorily. The Senegalese authorities requested that the Debi/Lampsar compo-
nents of the project be deleted from Credit 350-SE and be reformulated within
the broader framework of integrated development of the Senegal River Basin.
The proposed reformulation was agreed upon by IDA and an engineering project
for Debi/Lampsar was appraised in December 1974 and approved by the Board
in April 1975. Because of price increases and US dollar devaluation, the
proceeds of Credit 350-SE will not be sufficient to cover the project as
appraised, despite the deletion of the Debi/Lampsar component. The project
authority SAED (Societe d' Amenagement et d'Exploitation des Terres du Delta),
is presently seeking a supplementary financing of about US$1.2 million to
complete the project.
Cr. No. 366    Second Highway Project; US$8.0 Million
Credit of April 9, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Implementation of the maintenance program and engineering studies
started about six months behind schedule and execution has been slow. Work
on pavement strengthening began in February 1975, about 18 months later than
appraisal estimates. The scope of work will have to be reduced due to cost
increases and declining value of the US dollar. Engineering studies for the
next phase of pavement strengthening are on schedule and formed the basis for
a third project appraised in May 1975.
Cr. No. 404    Second Agriculture Credit Project; US$8.2 Million
Credit of June 7, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The 1974/75 campaign was good. Groundnut and cereal production reached
their highest level since 1969, about 50% over the 1973/74 production level.
Demand for medium-term credit remains stronger than anticipated, but available



ANNEX II
Page 6
credit funds will be sufficient to cover requirements for the next campaign.
The subsidy on fertilizers has not been reduced, as required, but the scheduled
study under Credit 404-SE should provide a basis for policy review. Major
organizational and financial problems still exist at ONCAD despite technical
assistance provided since 1969. Government has taken steps to remedy this
serious situation by giving ONCAD management more financial autonomy and by
strengthening it with qualified accountants.
Ln. No. S.3-SE      Ship Repair Engineering Loan:   US$0.6 Million loan of
September 20, 1973; Closing Date: March 6, 1976
The project consists of carrying out studies to determine the
feasibility of a dry dock project, including:
a.   Technical studies including those of physical and
geophysical factors affecting site situation.
b.   Economic studies including a market survey, a re-
vision of the dry dock project feasibility study
and a survey formulating a training program.
The loan became effective in February 1974 and the studies are
being reviewed by the Bank.
Cr. No. 446-SE       Drought Relief Project; US$3.0 MLllion Credit of
December 7, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The project is part of the Senegalese plan to help people in
drought affected areas to re-establish their self-sufficiency by assisting
them to redevelop and improve their farms and lands. The credit became
effective in February 1974. All sub-project plans have been approved by the
Association. Orders were placed in late 1973 for all project items, most of
the equipment is already in p:Lace and initial delays in disbursements should
be reversed shortly.
Ln. No. 987-SE       SOFISEDIT Project; US$3.0 Million Loan of May 24, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
This development finance company project would meet SOFISEDIT's
financial requirements for financing industrial and tourism projects through
1976.
Cr. No. 530-SE       Second Education Project:  US$15.0 Million Credit of
February 19, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The credit for science centers, vocational training and non-
formal rural education became effective in April 1975.

Cr. No. 549-SE      Sine Saloum Agricultural Development US$7.0 million
Credit of May 22, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
This project, due to start in 1976, aims at increasing and
diversifying agricultural production in the Sine Saloum region through the
reinforcement of SODEVA's activities.
Cr. No. S-18-SE     Debi-Lampsar Irrigation Engineering Credit,
US$1.0 million Credit of May 22, 1975; Closing
Date: September 2, 1975
The credit finances the execution of the engineering studies needed
for the implementation of the Debi-Lampsar irrigation scheme. With provision
for retroactive financing, the studies have been initiated.

would include a variety of items that prevent bulking to
make contracts attractive to international bidders.
Contracts for three wells required in 1975, totalling
US$0.1 million, would be awarded on the basis of
competitive bidding advertised locally in accordance
with local procedures which are satisfactory to the
Association. Because of their small number and the
high cost of works undertaken by local contractors,
alternative arrangements would be followed for the
other items: feeder roads and village access
tracks (US$0.6 million) would be constructed and improved
by the ministry of Works or the Army Engineering Corps;
six wells would be oonstructed and 15 improved (US$0.3
million) by Government well building brigades; low
cost village stores and junior staff housing (US$0.2
million) would be constructed with direct labor employed
and materials purchased by STN; and mechanical land
clearing (US$0.5 million) would be carried out on
force account using Government owned and operated
equipment. Contracts for vehicles and equipment
(US$0.1 million) would be awarded on the basis of local
suppliers' quotations. Farm inputs (US$0.6 million) would
be supplied by ONCAD. The remaining project costs comprise
personnel and management expenditures (US$0.8 million) and
grants and allowances to settlers (US$0.4 million) that
would be unsuitable for competitive bidding. Consultant
services (US$0.3 million) would be obtained according to
the Association's normal procedures.
Consultants:        Total consultants' services would amount to 36 man/months.
Rate of Return:     The economic rate of return of the project is estimated at
about 14 percent over 20 years.
