APPRAISAL OF
DRAINAGE AND ON-FARM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan Summary
Borrower:      Republic of Turkey.
Beneficiaries:
(a) The General Directorate of Rural Services within the Ministry
of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Affairs (GDRS);
(b) The General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (DSI) within
the Ministry of Energy & Natural Resources (MENR); and
(c) About 97,000 private farmers benefitting from the project.
Amount:        US$255 million
Terms:         SevenLeen years including four years of grace, with standard
variable interest rate.
Description:   The Drainage and On-farm Development Project (1986-1991).
consists of the following works:
(a) rehabilitation of surface drains to restore them to their
planned performance;
(b) excavation of additional, main, secondary and tertiary drains
to supplement the existing drainage system;
(c) installation of subsurface drainage network in medium and light
clayey soils;
(d) addition of subsurface collector pipe drains within the
existing subsurface drainage installations;
(e) reclamation of selected tracts of saline land to avoid serious
deterioration;
(f) construction of access roads along the irrigation and drainage
networks to facilitate operation and maintenance;
(g) construction of minor buildings, field workshops and other
structures for operation and maintenance of the system;
(h) installation of piezometers and other devices to monitor the
waterlogged areas;
(i) strengthening of existing drainage and reclamation research
stations in the irrigation areas;
(j) employment of engineering consulting firms by DSI and GDRS to
provide additional design and implementation capacity;
(k) employment of consulting firms by DSI and GDRS for review of
the work by the engineering consulting firms; and
(1) training of GDRS and DSI headquarters and regional staff in
selected fields and in appropriate countries.
Benefits and Risks
The proposed project would support the rationalization of the public
investment program for drainage and on-farm development, as part of
the Government's sectoral adjustment program for agriculture begun
with Bank assistance under the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan
(ASAL, Loan 2585-TU). The proposed investments would eliminate
waterlogging and salinity, restore the existing irrigated areas to
full production, and would prevent further deterioration of soils
and reduction in crop production. The approximately 97,000 farmers
who own and operate land in the 220,000 ha to be improved, and



neighboring farmers operating land which without the proposed
investments would eventually become waterlogged, would benefit. At
full development, annual on-farm employment in the improved areas
would increase by about 7 million mandays per year above the current
levels, an increase of about 20S of current on-farm employment
within the DSI irrigation perimeters. Adkditional exports of cotton
and pulses and fewer wheat imports nt fuLl development would
generate potential incremental foreign exchange earnings/savings
amounting to about US$177 million equivalent per year.
The main risks to achieving subsector objectives are institutional:
(a)  Availability of funding for the Irrigation and Drainage
Project, and within the subsector priority allocation of
resources to drainage and on-farm development;
(b)  Government's capacity to prepare, appraise and select priority
investments;
(c)  Ability of the implementing agencies to coordinate overlapping
implementation plans and schedules; and
(d)  Availability of adequate funding for O&M.
Measures are included to minimize these risks. To reduce the risk
of funding shortfalls, the Government will give the Bank an
opportunity to comment on the proposed budget allocations for the
project prior to finalization of the budget. If a shortfall in
annual program funding or delays should occur, selected program
elements could be deferred and the project period extended without
jeopardizing individual project benefits or subsector objectives.
Further provisions to minimize these risks include application of
criteria for selection of priority subprojects, improvement of
design and implementation capacities and training of DSI and GDRS
staff. In addition, the ASAL includes financing for procuring
essential equipment and the project provides the associated costs
needed to remove the constraint or. O&M arising from accumulated
rehabilitation requirements.

DRAINAGE ANDi ON-FARM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Government of Turkey has requested a Bank loan of $255 million to
assist in financing a Core Program of priority drainage and on-farm
development works. This program was agreed under the Agricultural Sector
Adjustment Loan (ASAL) (Loan No. 2585-TU) approved in June 1985 to support
implementation of the Government's policy and institutional reforms for the
agricultural sector, amongst which rationalization of public investment is key.
1.02     The proposed project is in line with the objectives of the Bank's
assistance strategy for Turkey. With Bank support, a five-year program of
economic stabilization and adjustment has been successfully completed. A
series of five Structural Adjustment Loans (SALs), of which the last was fully
disbursed in November 1985, has assisted Government efforts to restore the
external balance and market orientation of the economy. The adjustment
process has not been without flaws and major challenges ahead include the
further dampening of inflationary expectations, removal of financial market
distortions, reduction of unemployment, rationalization of the public
investment program and improved public resources mobilization, needed to
foster sustained growth. The ASAL responded to the need to broaden and deepen
the adjustment process at the 'cectoral and subsectoral levels, linking the
process to, and complementing the assistance provided through ongoing and
proposed Bank-financed agricultural projects. The ASAL was designed to
support Government initiatives to (a) phase out retail subsidies on
fertilizers and encourage private sector participation in the distribution of
fertilizers and other inputs, (b) strengthen sector planning and policy
formation, (c) systematize the application of trade and producer price
incentives, (d) rationalize public investment programming and financing of the
sector, and (e) strengthen implementing institutions and supporting services
by providing part of the foreign exchange needed for channel maintenance
equipment, consulting services and training needed to implement a first
time-slice of the Government's Core Program. The proposed project would
support initiatives to improve and strengthen the investment strategy,
institutions and public resource mobilization in the irrigation and drainage
subsector.
1.03     Several Bank missions during 1984 and early 1985 assisted the
Government in the design of the project. An appraisal team consisting of
Messrs. Mahmud Tirmazi, Javier Tellez and Edgar Hunting (IBRD) and Messrs.
Naceur Bakhtri and Barkat Ali (FAO/CP) visited Turkey in June 1985. This
report is based on their findings.

II. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Sectoral Adjustment Program
2.01     Backtround.  The Turkish economy has shown impressive response to the
structural adjustment program begun in 1980 and supported by the Bank. Since
the introduction of the adjustment program, the economy has demonstrated a
major shift in structure towards an outward oriented economy, operating witb a
markedly increased reliance on market forces. The transformation of Turkish
agriculture from heavily subsidized and protected production to financially
independent, diverse commercial and export activity is a key component of the
adjustment program.
2.02     Wile the relative importance of the agricultural sector in the
economy is declining, it still represents about 18% of GDP, about a third of
export earnings and about half of civilian employment. The growth rates of
agricultural GDP and exports are projected to remain below those for the rest
of the economy. Nevertheless, the agricultural sector will continue to play a
significant role in meeting domestic food needs, supplying industrial raw
materials, and providing foreign exchange earnings and employment.
2.03     Turkish agriculture is diverse. Intensive crop cultivation is
prevalent in the coastal regions which receive plentiful rainfall or are
equipped with irrigation facilities. Mixed (crop and livestock) farming
predominates in the eastern and central parts of the country where pastures
and meadows form more than half of the agricultural land and crop production
is dependent upon rainfall. In these areas much of the land is kept fallow in
alternating years. While the livestock production system is largely
traditional, dependent on grazing lands and low productivity systems of animal
husbandry, it produces about one-third of agricultural GDP. Cereal crops
occupy about 66Z of the cultivated area, fruits and vegetables about 20%,
industrial crops about 6%, and oil seeds, pulses and tubers the remaining 7Z.
2.04     Through the 1970s, Turkey's agricultural policies were
inward-looking, stressing food self-sufficiency through subsidized inputs and
producer prices. This led to relatively rapid growth of production through
the first half of the 1970s, averaging 4.7% from 1972-75. However, with a
deteriorating overall macroeconomic situation, these growth rates could not be
maintained due in part to the strain placed upon the budget by the level of
subsidization, and the competing demand for resources from the manufacturing
sector. As a result of the overall economic crisis, growth in the sector
slowed to less than 1.5% per annum during the late 19709. Ineffective public
investment policies, weaknesses in technical services, and problems in
marketing and credit also contributed to sluggish growth. During this period,
sectoral exports remained a small fraction (about 4Z) of total production due
to the overvalued exchange rate and other disincentives to export.
2.05     Nev Policies.  As part of the structural adjustment program adopted
by the Government in 1980, many of the incentives were dismuantled, and
market-oriented policies were introduced. With the introduction of a flexible
exchange rate policy, most commodity prices were brought in line with or below
export prices. The Government deregulated agricultural exports to a large
extent and, as a result, agricultural exports increased rapidly. The
commodity composition of exports gradually diversified, export markets



-3-
expanded to the Middle East and North Africa, and private exporters-
responding to the increasing opportunities--in part replaced publi  export
agencies. The Government also undertook to reduce input subsidies_/ and
production price supports, and to gradually convert the remaining supports
from artificially high incentive prices to floor prices. More recently, it
has liberalized the import regime for commodities and imported inputs. These
policies, in combination are designed to encourage specialization of
production in accordance with Turkey's comparative advantages through
intensified crop and animal husbandry patterns.
2.06     In the area of sector financing policies, the overall restraint on
monetary policy forced a curtailment of agricultural credit availability.
However, the Government committed itself under SAL IV to achieve and maintain
thereafter positive real interest rates in agricultural lending. Recent
interest rate increases and the decline in the rate of inflation suggest major
progress towards achieving real positive rates before end-1986-the target
date stipulated during the recent SAL V tranche review. In the Government's
medium-term objectives, resources available for agricultural lending will be
augmented and institutional capabilities will be strengthened.
2.07     The Government made progress towards rationalizing the public
investment program by constraining the rate of growth of the overall program
below 2.5% per year, in real terms, compared with over 18% per year before
1977, and by reducing the number of investment programs. In accord with the
adjustment program, the post-1980 investment policies led to an increased
share for agriculture in the public investment program, from 7% in 1980 to 10Z
in 1985 (Annex 1, Table 1). While public investment allocations were not
fully rationalized, the Government emphasized project completions and
investments with short gestation periods. Facing a shortfall in Government
revenues and worsening overall fiscal performance, the Government in 1981
introduced a 5% tax ("stoppage" tax) on all crop sales and 2X on animal and
animal products sales, in 1984 began to reduce export tax rebate incentives
and in January 1985 introduced a value-added tax (VAT) of 10X. In addition,
in 1983 under the IAEE project (Loan 2433-TU), the Government agreed to
increase cost recovery assessments and collections (para 6.06). Progress has
been made in implementing these agreements.
2.08     Performance.  As was expected, adoption of the new polirty package
initially resulted in severe short-run shocks for the sector: the growth of
agricultural GDP in real terms fell to an average of only 0.9% in 1980 and
1981. In 1982 and 1983, however, real growth in agricultural GDP recovered to
an average annual rate of 3.1%. During 1984, it reached 3.7Z. Due to the
adoption of a realistic exchange rate and relaxation of export licensing
restrictions, agricultural exports increased by an annual average of 17.7Z
during 1980 aud 1981. If agroindustrial exports are included, the average
annual rate of gcowth increases to 18.9%. In 1982 and 1983, while
agricultural exports continued to grow in volume, the average annual rate
1/ In 1979, prices paid by farmers for fertilizers averaged 70% below import
parity prices. By 1984 the average subsidy had been reduced to less than
50% below adjusted parity prices, while subsequent price adjustments have
largely eliminated the subsidy on the more important fertilizers used in
Turkey. The Government is committed under the ASAL to eliminate the
retail subsidy entirely (except for the costs of transport to remote low
income areas) by the end of 1988.



-4-
of growth of the value of agricultural exports dropped sharply to only 1.2%,
due to the decline in the prices of the main commodities. However, for
agriculture and agroindustries combined, the average annual rate of export
growth remained at a &ealthy 9.5X, indicating a significant switch from
unprocessed to processed exports. During 1985 the agricultural growth rate
declined to 2.3Z and exports for the first nine months declined by about 7Z,
reflecting the effects of an unusually severe drought.
2.09     Prospects.  The potential for Turkey's agricultural sector, over the
medium-term, was examined in the recent agricultural sector study by the
BankY and updated with more recent data. The report stated that the
possibilities for growth through expansion of the cropped area or of
livestock numbers under a system of extensive grazing, were largely exhausted
by the mid-1970s. Growth must now come primarily from increased
productivity-for which agricultural intensification is the key--and changing
the crop mixture to better reflect Turkey's comparative advantage. Increased
productivity would require expansion in the irrigated area through improved
efficiency of the implementing agencies (better planning, increased use of
contractors), better extension and research programs, expanded imports of
improved seeds and appropriate equipment, and increased availability of
institutional credit (particularly for small and medium-scale farmers).
2.10     The demands of an export-oriented approach have led to a change of
emphasis in Government policy from food self-sufficiency to increased net
agricultural contribution to the balance of trade. Thus, imports of certain
foods in which Turkey does not have a comparative advantage have been
allowed. Increasing agricultural exports has involved appropriate pricing
ignals, maintenance of a competitive exchange rate, reduction of export
regulations, and improved marketing. The initiatives introduced in these
policy areas since 1980 will have to be maintained.
2.11     While significant progress has been achieved in Turkey's structural
adjustment program over the past five years, the task of restructuring is by
no means over. During the second phase of the adjustment program, the
Government is determined to deepen the adjustment process to the sectoral
level in order to complete the foundation for sustained growth. Reattaining
historical growth rates in the agriculturaL sector, under conditions of
markedly reduced subsidization and increased exposure to market forces, will
require additional strengthening of the inputs distribution systems; reform
of agricultural SEEs and marketing agencies; a major effort to further
discipline public investment expenditures and to improve the priority and
selectivity of the irrigation and drainage program; an increase in the
effectiveness of technical services (agricultural extension and research) and
credit, and improved sectoral planning. With continued reform in these
areas, and adherence to policies designed to increase exports, agricultural
GDP is expected to achieve a growth rate of about 3.0X annually during the

B. The Irrigation and Drainage Subsector
2.12     Initiated through the ASAL and to be continued under the proposed
project, a marked change is being introduced in the development strategy for
irrigation and drainage with a view to rationalizing their public investment,
project selection criteria and method of carrying out the construction of
works to speed up project completion.
Importance of Irrigation and Drainage
2.13     Irrigation investment represents about 66% of the public sector
agricultural investment program and has been a major factor in increasing and
stabilizing agricultural production. While less than 15% of arable land is
irrigated, roughly 40% of all plant output and about 25% of agricultural
exports are grown under irrigation. In many respects, however, irrigated
agriculture has performed considerably below its capacity. Newly developed
irrigation projects have often failed to produce expected production
increases, while the increase in irrigated crop areas has lagged
significantly behind the expansion of irrigation infrastructure. The
underutilization of this infrastructure, built at comparatively high cost,
results in a large loss to the economy.
2.14     The main irrigated areas are along the Mediterranean coast and
southern reaches of the Aegean coast. The total area put under irrigation in
recent years is estimated to be about 4.7 million ha (out of 28 million ha of
arable land) which includes major Covernment irrigation projects (1.3 million
ha), Government constructed small irrigation schemes (1.0 million ha) and
private irrigation (2.4 million ha). However, the cropping intensity is low
-and no more than 70% of the area provided with public irrigation
inrrastructure is under crops in any year. Moreover, the total irrigated
area varies considerably from year to year, since wheat is not usually
irrigated in years of adequate rainfall.
2.15     Two public agencies are responsible for the construction of
irrigation facilities. The General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works
(DSI) of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) is responsible
for the construction of the basic irrigation infrastructure for large-scale
projects. The General Directorate of Rural Services (GDRS) of the Ministry
of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Affairs (MAFRA) is responsible for the
construction of on-farm development works on large-scale irrigation projects
and the development of small-scale projects. These agencies have not been
able to contribute fully to agricultural productivity increases because of
budget constraints, attempts to work on too many projects, excessive reliance
upon force account work, inadequate coordination between the two agencies in
project design and implementation, and poor supporting services, resulting in
slow project completion and limited agricultural benefits.
It      o  d  Draina    Pential
2.16     According to the last available comprehensive study by GDRS, an
estimated total area of 8.7 million ha could be irrigated. It is likely that
only a smaller area could be developed economically, when the cost of
development and competing uses of water resources are taken into account.



-6-
2.17     In addition to increases in irrigated areas, a large potential is
available for exploitation through the rehabilitation and completion of the
existing infrastructure and on-farm development works, respectively, within
the completed irrigation projects. A widespread system of surface drains and
pumping stations has been constructed simultaneously with the development of
irrigation infrastructure. However, since the introduction of large scale
irrigation, the surface drains and natural drainage streams have deteriorated
due to lack of maintenance and have been incapable of discharging the surface
runoff and the seepage from the fields and canals. The high water table has
caused waterlogging and consequent loss of production and, in some areas,
prevented leaching of incoming salts from the root zone. Installation of
subsurface drainage at the farm level, which was foreseen during project
preparation in areas with adverse soil conditions, has been completed only in
a small percentage of these areas. Rehabilitation and expansion of the
surface drainage systems and installation of subsurface drains on the farms
have thus become prerequisites for restoring and preserving the productivity
of the irrigated areas. An area of about 440,000 ha can thus be restored and
developed to full production at relatively low cost (Annex 2, para 2.06).
These areas, which can be developed in a relatively short period of time,
constitute the best economic potential for immediate agricultural development.
Previous Investment Strategy
2.18     Since 1981, irrigation investment levels have been increasing at
about 4Z per year, in real terms. The DSI investment program has averaged
about twice that of GDRS. Since 1980. when DSI resources were spread thinly
over 142 ongoing projects, considerable progress has been made in
concentrating DSI's resources on a smaller number of projects. As a result,
the new area placed under command each year by DSI has increased from
18,000 ha in 1981 to 86,000 ha in 1984. However, GDRS has recently been able
to complete only 10-12,000 ha per year of on-farm development, creating a
major backlog of work for on-farm development on completed DST schemes (para
2.20). This ever-increasing backlog between irrigation infrastructure
development by DSI and GDRS' on-farm development works represents a major
misallocation of public resources for irrigation investment.
2.19     In the past, Turkey's public investment programs favored allocations
to large new irrigation infrastructure. By the end of 1984, DSI had
completed 146 large irrigation projects covering an area of 1.11 million ha.
Meanwhile, partial completion has been achieved on another 52 projects (total
area 0.44 million ha). The actual irrigated crop area has lagged
significantly behind the expansion of irrigation infrastructure, as shown in
Table 2.1 below. By the end of 1984, an area of 266,000 ha which had been
provided with the irrigation facilities was not being used.

2.20     The reasons for this discrepancy between DSI development and actual
utilization lie in (i) the neglected state of operation and maintenance,
particularly of the surface drainage systems, which has now assumed such
proportions that these drains would require rehabilitation, and (ii) the
absence of on-farm development works in most areas. These latter works,
summarized in Table 2.2 below, which are the responsibility of GDRS, include
subsurface drainage and land reclamation works and, to a lesser extent, land
levelling.

leaving intact a growing backlog and its adverse effects on the agricultural
economy.

2.21     Total budgetary allocations to the irrigation and drainage subsector,
and distribution of funds between DSI and GDRS appear to have been based on
historical trends. Of the total for the irrigation and drainage subsector,
DSI's allocation covers about two-thirds vs GDRS's share of about one-third.
Thus, the fact that there was a major difference in the rate at which GDRS and
DSL were finishing their respective work loads did not have an impact on
overall allocation policy. The investment program in current and constant
prices for both agencies in recent years is shown in Table 2.3. While GDRS's
budget in 1980-the year when Government first moved to meet the economic
crisis--showed a significant reduction in constant 1985 terms, overall, since
1979, the budget has shown an increase of about 30%. However, this increase
does not reflect the high priority required for on-farm development works.

Note:  Actual expenditures from 1979 - 1984, and budget allocations in 1985.
2.22     Public investment policies in the past have led to the financing of a
large number of DSI projects located in widely dispersed parts of the
country. During the period 1975-80, annual allocations for new and ongoing
DSI projects averaged some 4% of their total construction cost, thus implying
an average construction period of 25 years. In 1983 and 1984, these figures
wez: 8% to 9% and 11 to 12 yearb, respectively.  While this represents an
improvement, the average yearly allocations per project are still not nearly
sufficient to allow projects to be completed within the initially projected
construction period, which, for new projects, has averaged about five years.
A New Approach
2.23     During the remainder of the Fifth Five Year Plan period, Turkey will
likely continue to face severe limitations on domestic and foreign financial
resources. The major constraint to effective development of irrigation and
drainage thus has been the poor investment allocation practiced by the works
agencies. Both DSI and GDRS have responded with difficulty to the new
exigencies of public investment mandated by the structural adjustment program,
viz, a concentration of future investments on quickly gestating projects with
high economic returns. The problem has been compounded by a lack of



-9-
coordination between DSI and GDRS at the planning level. As a result, the
agencies have continued to carry out their annual work programs for irrigation
and drainage development more or less independently. Furthermore, GDRS's
design and construction capability is severely constrained by a near total
reliance on force account construction for major works with the use of
contractors being confined to supplemental tasks.
2.24     The Government recognizes, however, that a rapid expansion of the
completion rate is possible (along with realization of agricultural
intensification) if the agricultural investment budget continues to be
rationalized through (i) further concentration of DSI resources on quickly
gestating new projects and drainage rehabilitation investments; (ii) providing
GDRS with the capability to complete drainage and on-farm works in areas where
major irrigation tacilities have been completed or are nearing completion; and
(iii) improving maintenance. This would be facilitated by procedural changes
to improve (i) the implementation capacity of the works agencies; (ii) design
efficiency; and (iii) planning and coordination, to be supported by the
development of effective extension services able to introduce appropriate
irrigation techniques to first time users and to farmers currently using
inappropriate methods and cropping patterns.
2.25     To implement this new approach, Government has agreed to carry out an
Irrigation Development Study and formulate a 10-year Irrigation Development
Master Plan (1986-1995) using funds made available under the IAEE Irrigation
Project (Loan 2433-TU). The Master Plan would be based on a detailed
project-by-project inventory and an assessment of existing and projected
irrigation and on-farm development investments and financial and
implementation constraints. It would detail the issues and targets to be
reached including additional works required, cost and timing, arrangements for
sustainability of irrigation works and cost recovery improvement. The
Government has indicated that it would be utilizing the services of the
consultants being appointed for the proposed Drainage and On-Farm Development
Project to carry out the preparation of the Master Plan. In parallel, and
with financing from the Bank-assisted Agricultural Extension and Applied
Research Project (Loan 2405-TU), the Government is also implementing a program
to improve agricultural extension, with priority for irrigated areas.
2.26     The Government's overall Irrigation and Drainage Investment Program
during the 1985-1989 Plan period includes completion of irrigation
infrastructure for 475,000 ha of new lands by DSI, similar infrastructure for
325,000 ha of small schemes to be carried out by GDRS and drainage and on-farm
development works. The total cost of this project is estimated at about
TL 1,200 billion (US$2.2 billion). Under the recently approved Agriculture
Sector Adjustment Loan, a Core Program for Irrigation and Drainage Investments
was agreed, designed to bring abont adequate drainage in the command area of
DSI's ongoing and completed projects, the completion of highest priority
on-farm works, and the provision of adequate O&M to insure the optimum
utilization of the command area. This Core Program, established in
consultation with the Bank (Annex 3, page 1), would cost about US$1.21 billion
and would be carried out within the context of the revised funding criteria
and priorities to be applied to project selection, as agreed under the ASAL
(Annex 3, page 2). These works will be assigned the highest priority until
the on-farm development backlog has been overcome.



-10-
2.27     The Government has agreed to progressively increase, in real terms,
the share of GDRS, and to allocate annually from the investment budget, the
full requirement of an agreed high priority core program of drainage and
on-farm development works. Specific works to be completed under this program
would be selected in accordance with criteria agreed with the Bank. The
Government indicated its intent to maintain funding levels beginning in 1986
to permit GDRS to complete 100,000 ha/year of on-farm works. This would also
be facilitated by increased reliance on contract construction work. In order
to supplement current staff capacity for implementing this project, the ASAL
finances engineering consultants for a two year period to assist in
operational programming, scheduling and design of approved works in the Core
Program, and in monitoring their implementation. In view of the complexity of
the task, the ASAL also finances internationally recruited consultants to
review the economic, agricultural, and engineering work of the consulting
engineering firms. To assist DSI in implementing its portion of the Core
Program (excavation of new surface drains in a length of about 6,000 km,
rehabilitation of the existing systems, and subsequent maintenance of the new
and existing systems through improved OWM), ASAL finances a portion of the
machinery and equipment imports needed for the rehabilitation and maintenance
of surface drains.
2.28     As described in Chapter III of this report, the proposed project
would support the implementation of a first slice of Core Program works. It
would also finance a continuation of the consulting services and training
programs begun under the ASAL--which are required to strengthen the work's
agencies capabilities and to assist with the implementation of the new
approach.
C. Performance Under Previous Irrigation Projects
2.29     The Bank and IDA have provided financing for six irrigation projects
in Turkey through loans and credits totalling about US$274 million. Some of
these projects included power components. All but one (the IAEE Irrigation
Project approved in June 1984) have been completed. Aside from components
under two rural development projectsl/, no irrigation lending took place
between 1973 and 1984 due to failure to zeach agreement on adequate measures
regarding cost recovery.
2.30     While irrigation cost recovery has been a problem, significant
progress is being made on this issue, as described in para 6.07 below. The
Government would maintain adequate water charges on both DSI and GDRS' works
in the area served by this project, in accordance with the same criteria
agreed for the IAEE Project (Loan 2433-TU), namely full recovery of DSI O&M
expenditure for the prior year, recovery of DSI capital costs over a period
not to exceed 50 years, and recovery of GDRS costs over 20 years.
2.31     The most recently completed Project Performance Audit Reports (PPARs)
and Impact Evaluation Report 2/ on two irrigation projects found them to have
been generally successful and to have high economic benefits. But, in
addition to the issue of cost recovery, the PPARs noted initial delays in
establishing project implementing units and periodic delays in providing

1130-TU), and the ongoing Erzurum Rural Development Project (Loan 2094-TU).

adequate local cost financing. The proposed project has been designed to take
full account of these lessons.  In the areas served by the Ceyhan-Aslantas
project (Loan 883-TU/Credit 360-TU, FY 1973) and the Corum-Cankiri Rural
Development Project (Loan 1130-TU, FY 1975) the extension service has been
using an improved approach pioneered under several Bank projects. The
Government has recognized the need to reorganize and strengthen its extension
activities and is developing programs for introducing the new extension system
on a nationwide basis. Loan 2405-TU (Agricultural Extension and Applied
Research Project), approved in 1984, assists in financing a first phase
program to introduce improved extension and research methods in 16 of Turkey's
67 provinces. A second extension and research project is currently under
preparation. Since the proposed Drainage and On-Farm Development Project
would finance completion or improvement of services for ongoing irrigation
programs, most of the implementation units already exist. Government has
agreed to the arrangements for Bank review of proposed project budget
provisions (para 3.22) which would provide arA early warning system and
facilitate compliance with Government undeL.Lakings to provide adequate
financial support for the project.
III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT
A. Objectives and Strategy
3.01     The objectives of the proposed Drainage and On-Farm Development
Project are to concentrate Government's resources, while remaining within the
scope of the Core Program agreed under the ASAL (Loan 2585-TU), on those
subprojects which have the highest priority and, at the same time, to assist
in improving design and implementation capacity of DSI and GDRS.
3.02     In line with the investment priorities and the strategy agreed under
the ASAL, the proposed project would include surface and subsurface drainage,
land reclamation, and access roads, which constitute the key elements for
accelerating the completion of on-farm development works. The proposed
project would finance the first time slice of the Core Program to be
implemented during 1986-1991. In selecting the first time slice, the
following criteria were applied:
(i)   works which can be initiated during the next three years and
completed by December 31, 1991;
(ii)   rehabilitation of surface drainage works which are a prerequisite
for any subsurface drainage;
(iii)   projects where irrigation infrastructure by DSI has been
physically completed and the on-farm development works can be
started immediately by GDRS;
(iv)   synchronized completion of all work components in any given area,
and maintaining the investment targets;
(v)   priority selection criteria and resource allocation; and
(vi)   institution building through consultants and training.
The associated costs of the total Core Program, the first time slice and the
financing of investments from the ASAL are abstracted in Table 3.1.

B. Main Features - First Time Slice
3.03     The objectives of the Drainage and On-farm Development Project,
during the first time slice, would be achieved through the implementation of
the following works:
(a)    rehabilitation and cleaning of surface drains to restore them to
their planned performance;
(b)    excavation of additional main, secondary and tertiary drains, where
needed to supplement the existing drainage system;
(c)    installation of subsurface drainage network in light to medium soils
which cannot be drained by surface drains;
(d)    addition of subsurface collector pipe drains, wherever not already
provided within the existing subsurface drainage installations;
(e)    reclamation of selected tracts of saline land to avoid serious
deterioration;
(f)    construction of access roads along the irrigation and drainage
networks to facilitate operation and maintenance and to otherwise
connect with the public roads system;
(g)    construction of minor buildings, field workshops and other structures
for operation and maintenance of the system;
(h)    installatiou of piezometers and other devices to monitor the water-
logged areas;
(i)    strengthening of existing drainage and reclamation research stations
in the irrigation areas;
(j)    employment of engineering consulting firms by DSI and GDRS, to assist
in preparation of inception reports, feasibility studies, and bidding
documents for execution of works and in their supervision when
appropriate;
(k)    employment of reviewing consulting firms by DSI and GDRS for review
of the work done by the engineering consulting firms; and
(1)    training of GDRS and DSI headquarters and regional staff in selected
fields and in appropriate countries.
A description of these components is given in paras 3.04 to 3.15. Details of
the project area including topography, soils, climate, population, land
tenure, present agricultural situation, agricultural research and extension
are given in Annex 2. The locations of completed, ongoing and future
irrigation and drainage projects within the Core Program are shown on map
numbers IBRD 19280 and IBRD 19281

C. Project Description
3.04     Rehabilitation and Cleaning of Existing Surface Drains.  Silt
clearance and weed removal from surface drains and repairs to damaged
earthwork and structures are some of the esseatial maintenance requirements.
Under DSI regulations, main surface drains are required to be cleared every
three years and secondaries and tertiaries every five years. Due to lack of
appropriate equipment, the maintenance of the drainage systems is generally
neglected and therefore drainage ditches are choked with silt deposits and
weed growth. Consequently, subsurface drainage outlets from the adjoining
high water table areas are submerged and cannot evacuate the groundwater from
these affected areas. In most of the completed irrigation projects, the
drainage systems are blocked to varying degrees and are malfunctioning. The
on-farm development works proposed by GDRS, in particular subsurface drainage
networks, cannot be carried out until the surface drainage systems have been
rehabilitated by DSI and are maintained to their original design sections.
Rehabilitation of surface drainage systems comprises five categories of work:
(i) excavation of accumulated silt, (ii) grading and stabilization of O&M
roads, (iii) rehabilitation of embankments along drains, (iv) cleaning of
flood channels and creeks which serve as recipients of drainage flows and (v)
stabilization of operation and maintenance roads along these flood channels.
The initial thrust of this rehabilitation program by DSI would be under the
first two categories and would be concentrated on those priority areas where a
coordinated program of on-farm development works has been agreed and
established between GDRS and DSI. Surface drains serving an area of
668,000 ha are expected under the first time slice to be rehabilitated and
cleaned.
3.05     Construction of New Surface Drains.  DSI's jurisdiction extends to
main, secondary and some tertiary surface drains. In projects which are
opened for irrigation, DSI is expected to complete the surface drainage
network simultaneously. However, as a result of irrigation application and a
low initial intensity of surface drains, salinity and waterlogging problems
have since arisen, over significant areas. Studies by DSI indicate that for
effective surface drainage the intensity of surface drains should be 15 m/ha.
Host of the waterlogged areas have an average intensity of only 5.6 m/ha and
is a contributory factor towards water logging. It has been estimated that a
total of 6,000 km of additional surface drains of all sizes would be required
in the existing irrigated area; however, under the first time slice only
priority sub-areas (about 668,000 ha) would be undertaken.
3.06     Installation of Subsurface Drains.  Light to medium clay soils with
ground water table between 0-1 m and, which cannot be drained by surface
drains would require subsurface drainage. The existing data indicate that for
effective lowering of the water table a spacing of about 30-35m between drains
would be necessary. A depth of 1.2 m at the head of the drain would be
sufficient to grow most crops in the area except in saline areas, where to
avoid secondary salinization due to capillary action, a greater depth (about
1.8m) would be necessary. An approximate area of 137,500 ha is expected to be
provided with subsurface drainage facilities, of which about 40,000 ha are
saline and would also require reclamation (para 3.08).



-15-
3.07     Installation of Collector Pipes in Existing Areas.  The
responsibility for carrying out all on-farm development works, including
subsurface drainage works, rests with GDRS, which has completed about
150,000 ha of tile drainage network over the last two decades (para 3.18). In
most cases the subsurface drains have been connected by GDRS to DSI's outlet
drains through small surface drains instead of collector pipes, probably to
save on investment costs irrespective of the difficulties of maintenance. Due
to absence of maintenance, these minor drains are unable to perform their
functions and do not provide a proper linkage between the two systems,
resulting in serious malfunctioning of the already installed tile drains.
Most of these open surface drains should have been subsurface collectors to
start with. The Project provides for the replacement of these existing
surface tertiary drains constructed by GDRS, by subsurface pipe collectors.
An area of about 75,000 ha would be provided with these improved subsurface
installations.
3.08     Reclamation of Saline and Alkaline Land.  Salt affected areas would
be provided with enclosed levees, about 0.6 m in height, and the areas would
be leached. Minor areas suffer from alkali problem and would require
application of chemical amendments (gypsum) to improve soil permeability, lost
due to excess sodium in the soil. An area of about 40,000 ha is expected to
be reclaimed.
3.09     Construction of Access Roads.  Provision has been made for
improvement of road network through construction of about 1,310 km of access
roads. These roads which are necessary for maintenance of the drainage
systems, their structures and pumping stations would be 7.3 m wide within a
right of way of 13 m along main drains and 4.6 m wide within a right of way of
8.7 m along secondary drains and would be compacted and stabilized with
gravel. As far as feasible, these will be constructed along the irrigation
and drainage channels and linked with main and other roads of the area. Total
area served by these access roads would be about 85,000 ha.
3.10     Facilities for O&M.  A number of minor field offices, field stores,
warehouses, other structures and field workshops would be constructed under
the project to serve as facilities needed by the operation and maintenance
staff.
3.11     Installation of Piezometers & Other Observation Devices.  A grid
network of piezometers and observation wells would be installed at suitable
intervals in the water logged and potentially water logged areas to monitor
groundwater levels and observe the effect of anti-waterlogging measures.
3.12     Strengthening of Drainage Research Stations.  Eleven research
stations are in operation within GDRS and are located at Menemen, Eskisehir,
Ankara (2), Tarsus, Konya, Urfa, Erzurum, Samsun, Tokat & Kirklarelli. With
the exception of the first five, the remaining stations have been recently set
up and are lacking in equipment and staff. The two stations located in the
waterlogged areas (Menemen and Konya) would be strengthened through provision
of buildings, research and other equipment and library facilities.

3.13     Employment of Engineering Consulting Firms.  The existing staff of
DSI and GDRS would require technical assistance through consulting engineering
firms to assist them with the intensive work under the first time slice
project. The recruitment of consulting engineering firms has already been
agreed and their initial period of work would be financed from the ASAL. The
first draft of the terms of reference and scope of work has been reviewed by
the Bank and the Government is exiected to submit shortly a revised draft of
these documents. Upon completion of disbursements under the ASAL (Closing
Date - December 31, 1987) the consultants' continued employment would be
maintained throughout the implementation period with additional financing from
the proposed project (para 8.01 (a)). The responsibility of these firms,
inter alia, would include the completion of the following tasks to assist in
the implementation of the Drainage and On-farm Development Project (man-months
are shown in Annex 3, Table 1):
(i)    inception reports, setting out the criteria and priorities;
(ii)    feasibility studies for the projects selected to be initiated during
the period 198C-1991;
(iii)   final designs, cost estimates and bidding documents for
implementation cf the selected projects; and
(iv)    supervision of construction.
3.14     Employment of Reviewing Consulting Firms.  In view of the complexity
of the task, a periodic review of the economic, engineering and agricultural
work by the consulting engineering firms employed by GDRS and DSI would be
required through specialized reviewing consulting firms. The recruitment of
these reviewing consulting firms has also been already agreed and would be
financed initially from the ASAL with supplementary financing from the
proposed project. The first draft of the terms of reference has been reviewed
by the Bank and a revised document is expected to be submitted shortly. Their
employment would be maintained throughout the implementation period with
additional financing from the proposed project (para 8.01 (a)).
3.15     Training of Staff.  DSI and GDRS staff would be provided with
technical training in selected fields related to the works of the Core Program
and in strengthening farmers' organizations involved in irrigation and
drainage. The training program would extend over about 400 man-months of
training abroad in addition to the in-house training with the consulting
engineering firms and would cover about 35 trainees from DSI and GDRS. The
training period would be equally divided among drainage engineers,
agricultural economists and agronomists who would receive training in Europe
and USA. Approximately half the candidates would be attached to construction
companies and to drainage institutes for practical training, while the other
half would receive academic training and degrees.
D. Riparian Rights
3.16     It was agreed during negotiations that the sub-projects to be
financed under the loan would be selected from an agreed list of 155 DSI's
irrigation and drainage schemes, both completed and on-going (details at Annex
3, Table 2). None of these 155 schemes are located on an international river
and, therefore, no riparian rights issues are involved (para 8.01 (b)).

E. Status of Engineering
DSI
3.17     Until December 1984, DSI had achieved the following progress in
construction of large scale irrigatLon projects:

4. Final designs under preparation                   285,720              31
Details of these projects are shown on map numbers IBRD 19280 and IBRD 19281.
On-farm development works are identified by DSI at the planning or feasibility
stage; however, as these are to be carried out by GDRS which is under a
separate ministry, these designs are not carried further. During appraisal
the mission examined and summarized the findings contained in 242 feasibility
studies retrieved from DSI's archives. The data derived from the feasibility
studies on subsurface drainage and land reclamation would serve as the base
line data, which would need to be updated and refined to the final design
Level. However, DSI's designs of the completed irrigation and drainage
systems are meticulously drafted and maintained. No additional technical
design work is, therefore, necessary for the rehabilitation of the surface
drainage system to be carried out by DSI. The new surtace drains are located
in the fully designed and completed irrigated areas and constitute extension
ot the systems for which only minor additional design work is necessary. The
tinal designs for these new drains would be completed during 1986 while actual
implementation would start in 1987. In addition, DSI would be assisted by a
consulting engineering firm in programmingi preparing, and implementing the
drainage program in coordination with GDRSY.  The consulting firm would
also assist DSI in the review of its annual investment program, new and
ongoing as related to the coie program. Proposals for short-listing of these
consultants have already been finalized.  The terms of reference and scope of
work are now under revision by the Government and are expected to be submitted
shortly for Bank approval. It is, therefore, evident that all consultancy
arrangements are well advanced and final designs for the DSI works for the
1986 program are substantially ready.
1/ The employment of these consultants will be a condition of loan
effectiveness (para 8.03).

GDRS
3.18     On-farm development works are undertaken by GDRS on a piecemeal basis
and design and execution of construction proceed simultaneously.
Consequently, in one project area the works continue for many years. During
appraisal the mission carried out an extensive review of all on-farm
development works carried out by GDRS since 1976. The findings of this review
would again serve as a part of the base line data for the GDRS' works under
the project. The quantities completed until end of 1984 are summarized below:

(Note: These areas are not additive as most activities are overlapping in the

When compared with the areas which have been provided with irrigation
infrastructure by DSI, and considering the existing and potential backlog of
on-farm development works it is obvious that GDRS would not be able to meet
the design and implementation requirements of the first time slice project
unless assisted by a competent consulting engineering firm. As in the case of
DSI, early actions for employment of consultants have already been taken and
proposals for short listing have been finalized-'. Government is now
reviewing the detailed terms of reference and scope of work and is expected to
submit a revised document shortly for Bank approval. The final design for the
subsurface drainage works would be prepared during 1986 while actual
implementation would start in 1987.
Consultants' Program and Procedures
3.19     The Government's program for the first year's subprojects which
relate only to rehabilitation of surface drains would be submitted by the
Government for Bank approval in early 1986. Before initiating procurement for
the second year's subprojects, the Government assisted by the Consulting Firms
would prepare and select a program based on agreed selection criteria, which
would be submitted to the Bank for review and approval along with the
procurement documents. The same procedure would be followed during the
succeeding years of implementation. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that these procedures would govern the program of the selection of
subprojects (para 8.01 (c)}.
1/ The employment of these consultants will be a condition of loan
effectiveness.

F. Cost Estimate
3.20     The total estimated cost of implementing the Core Program, excluding
taxes and duties,11 but including physical and price contingencies is about
USS1.21 billion. The foreign exchange component whLch includes both direct
and indirect foreign costs is estimated at about US$702 million or 58% of the
total cost. The total estimated cost of the proposed project for the first
time slice (1986-1991) is about USS480.5 million, excluding the cost of
equipment for rehabilitation and maintenance of surface drains and the initial
consultants and training programs, financed under the ASAL. The direct aud
indirect foreign exchange component is estimated at about USS255.0 million or
about 53Z of the total cost of the time slice (1986-1991). These estimated
costs are based on unit rates currently applicable (December 1985) on similar
works in Turkey. The mission, working on typical technical designs, also
calculated independently the quantities of work, cost of operation of various
types of earth moving and excavation equipment, unit rate analysis, and the
toreign exchange component. Physical contingencies at 15Z of the base cost
have been added on civil works. Price contingencies have been compounded
annually for the years 1986 to 1991 respectively, at 7.0X, 7.0%, 7.5%, 7.7X,
7.6X and 4.5% for local and foreign costs. In calculating local cost
contingencies it is assumed that the Government will continue its current
policy of adjusting the value of its currency to compensate for the difference
between the local inflation and average international inflation. Total price
contingencies over the implementation period would amount to about US$101.3
million, or about 27X of base cost plus physical contingencies. Cost
estimates for the proposed project are summarized in the Table 3.2 and the
annual schedules of expenditures, for the total Core Program, the First Time
Slice (1986-1991), and the Second Time Slice (1989-1993) are given at Annex 3,
Tables 3, 4 and 5.

Among the six representative projects the cost/ha of the waterlogged area
ranges from US$1,359 to US$2,869. The average cost/ha of the project to be
carried out in the first time slice is US$2,309 per ha. The inland type areas
require on the average about 652 higher investment cost per hectare as
compared to the coastal type area, mainly due to higher intensity of
subsurface drainage and problems of drainage outfalls.
G. Financing
3.22     The proposed Bank loan (US$255 million) would finance about 53Z of
the cost of the first time slice project (US$480.5 million) l/, or lOOZ of the
foreign exchange component. Local costs of US$239, as well as interest during
construction and interest charges, would be met by the Government through
annual budget appropriations. During negotiations the Government presented its
indicative planning figures for the irrigation subsector. These figures are
in line with the Government's policies, recorded in connection with ASAL, for
allocating to agriculture about lOS of the total budget allocations for all
sectors. Irrigation and drainage works, to be carried out by DSI and GDRS
will receive about 66X of the sectoral allocations for agriculture. The
investment budget for irrigation and drainage will be increased progressively
in real terms; however, considering the importance of on-farm development
works, the GDRS's allocations will receive an accelerated increase in real
terms, as compared to the DSI's allocations. Government's planned future
allocations for GDRS and DSI, as presented at negotiations, are shown below in
Table 3.4:

/. Based an docummts tabled on Jamnary 7, 1986 by the Turkish negotiati  teen.
Note. Based m 198b actual allocations, calauated in 1986 prices, with iucreases in real term.
The proposed allocations to drainage and on-farm development works, included
in the core program are estimated to be sufficient to permit the second phase
of the Core Program to be completed by 1993. Details of proposed annual
allocations under the core program, the first time slice and the second time
slice are given n Annex 3, Tables 3, 4 and 5. Assurances were received that
updated financing plans will be submitted ro the Bank every year and would
include a revised schedule of estimated .-xpenditures, Laking into account the
effects of inflation on costs.  These revised financing plans would be
submitted to the Bank for its review by September 30 each year (para 8.01
(d)). The Bank loan would be repaid over 17 years including a 4 year grace
period. Financing of the cost including contingencies for the project for
(1986-91) would be shared in the afrmunts and proportions as given in Table 3.5.

3.24     Surface Drainage Works. All equipment for rehabilitation and
maintenance of surface drains (US$111.0 million) would be financed under the
ASAL, and procured under ICB procedures consistent with Bank Guidelines. The
execution of rehabilitation and maintenance works for surface drains
(US$164.05 million) through utilization of this equipment would, however, be
carried out by the 25 regional directorates of DSI through force account.
This procedure would be the most economical and consistent with Bank
procedures as it would ensure procurement of all equipment through ICB, while
the rehabilitation and maintenance works which are complex and in scattered
locations and which cannot be pieced together for a bidding document would be
carried out through force account.
3.25     On-farm Development Works. These civil works consisting of
installation of subsurface drains, reclamation of saline land, and
construction of access roads, constitute the bulk of the Project during
1986-89 (about US$305.21 million). With the assistance of consulting firms,
GDRS would establish priority annual investment programs, based on agreed
criteria (Annex 3, page 2), which would be coordinated with the programs of
rehabilitation and construction of surface drainage works to be carried out by
DSI for the respective years. The subprojects would be regionally combined to
form groups sufficiently large to attract international bidders. To the
extent practicable, contracts for works shall be grouped in packages estimated
to cost the equivalent of US$15 million or more each. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that these civil works would be procured under
ICB procedures consistent with the "Guidelines for Procurement under World
Bank Loan and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in May 1985 (Bank Guidelines)
(para 8.01 (e)).
3.26     Consulting and Reviewing Consulting Firms. Employment of consulting
engineering firms and reviewing consulting firms by DSI and GDRS has already
been agreed and would be financed in the earlier years from the ASAL (US$4.0



-25-
million). These consulting firms would be engaged under the ASAL, with
contracts covering the entire period of implementation. Supplementary
financing for the remaining years, about US$7.6 million including
contingencies, would be provided under the proposed project.
3.27     Strengthening of Drainage Research Stations, Facilities for O&M and
Monitoring of Ground Water. Civil works contracts for research stations and
facilities for O&M, estimated to cost a total of US$ 1.93 million, would be
procured under ICB procedures consistant with Bank Guidelines. Assurances to
this effect were obtained during negotiations (para 8.01 (e)). Contracts for
equipment for the research stations and for monitoring of ground water
estimated to cost about US$200,000 would be awarded on the basis of price
quotations solicited from at least three suppliers eligible under the Bank
Guidelines, in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. The
installation of piezometers, estimated to cost about US$0.82 million, would be
carried out by DSI through force account. DSI has already installed ground
water monitoring devices in 38 existing schemes, and is the agency best suited
to continue this on-going program.
I. Implementation Schedule
3.28     It is estimated that within the areas with high water table problems,
with groundwater reaching 0-lm depth during March/April, about 137,500 ha
would be provided with subsurface drainage facilities. Implementation of this
component is critical and is expected to proceed as shown below:
Table 3.7 Schedule of Implementation for Subsurface Drainage Works
(1986-1999)
Installation Subsurface Drainage   1986   198;   1988   1989   1990   1991    Total

3.29     All advance actions necessary to expedite the implementation of other
works have been taken.  All equipment required for the rehabilitation and
maintenance of surface drains has been prefinanced under the ASAL and
procurement actions are well advanced. Employment of consultants for DSI and
GDRS has also been prefinanced under the ASAL and in this case as well,
procurement actions are well advanced. Most of the works expected to be
completed during the first year pertain to rehabilitation of surface drainage
works for which no additional designs are required. Agreement has already
been reached with the Government on the selection criteria for subprojects
(Annex 3, page 2). A complete Schedule of Implementation for all construction
works is given in Annex 3 -Chart 1.
J. Disbursements
3.30     The proposed loan of US$ 255 million would be disbursed over seven
years.  Table 3.7 sets for'h the categories of items to be financed out of the
proceeds of the loan, the allocations of the amounts of the loan to each
category and the percentage of expenditures for items so to be financed in
each category:

A disbursement schedule is given in Annex 3, Table 12. The entire loan is
expected to be disbursed in about 7 years as compared to 7 years for 95% of
the disbursements under the standard disbursement profile for Turkey. The
proposed schedule is only slightly shorter than the historical profile for
recent agricultural projects in Turkey as it is intended that the proposed
project would finance a six-year time slice of an accelerated but ongoing
drainage and on-farm development project. Prefinancing for critical items of
machinery and institutional support to strengthen implementation and design
capacities of the implementing organizations has already been provided under
the ASAL. Procurement procedures are well advanced which would accelerate
implementation and disbursements. Disbursements will be made against normal
documentation, except for reimbursement to DSI on force account and payment
under contracts with a total value under $10,000 for equipment and $20,000 for
civil works, which would be made against statements of expenditure. Documents
for disbursements against statement of expenditures would be audited (para
4.10) and the supporting documents would be retained by DSI and made available
for review by Bank supervision missions.



-27-
3.31     Most expenditures under the proposed loan would be financed initially
from a special account. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the
Government will establish a special account in the Central Bank of Turkey to
deal exclusively with eligible expenditures under the project (para 8.0'
(g)).  The World Bank would make an initial deposit of US$20 million. 1/  The
Special Account would be replenished against withdrawal requests at monthly
intervals or as appropriate when the undisbursed balance of the account falls
below US$10 million. Imports would be made directly by actual users.
K. Environmental Impact
3.32     The drainage and on-farm development project is confined to areas
which are already developed and served by fully or partially completed
irrigation and drainage systems. In the coastai areas, which predominate, the
project is likely to have beneficial effects by providing drainage to the
waterlogged land in several subproject areas with effluent going into the
sea. In the case of inland rivers which open into lakes, the salts and other
pollutants carried would be inconsequential and hence, no detrimental effects
on the physical/chemical/biological regime of the water or soil are expected.
The improved drainage provided under the project would also be expected to
reduce mosquito breeding and lead to a reduction in the incidence of malaria.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Implementing Agencies and Responsibilities
4.01     Implementation of the project under the first time slice would be the
responsibility of the General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (DSI) and
the General Directorate of Rural Services (GDRS). A brief description of the
two agencies and their responsibilities follows:
General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works
4.02     DSI was established in 1954 as a legal entity and was brought under
the aegis of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources in 1964. Its
responsibilities are the multiple utilization of surface a-Id groundwater
resources, the prevention of soil erosion and flood contrcl. More
specifically its duties are to plan and construct;
(i)    flood protection works;
(ii)    irrigation and drainage systems and drainage of swamps;
(iii)   hydro-electric generating plants;
(iv)    city water supply and treatment schemes;
(v)    river improvement schemes;
(vi)    to carry out and record soil surveys and agricultural feasibility
studies; and
(vii)   to operate and maintain schemes.
1/  This amount is based on the World Bank's estimated share of the
tour-months average of foreign exchange expenditures to be channeled
through the revolving fund.



-28-
DSI headquarters, located in Ankara, i8 headed by a General Director with four
assistants, a bureau and council as advisers. The headquarters organization
has 13 departments concerned with planning and implementation of activities,
the provision and maintenance of services, research and planning, agricultural
development, accounts, administration and training (Annex 4, Chart 1).
Responsibility for the implementation of the project would rest with the
Design and Construction Department, whose department chief would also act as
the project director. Assistance would be forthcoming from all other
departments, in particular the maintenance and operation, planning and
investigation and machinery departments. Operations at field level are
carried out through 25 regional directorates (Annex 4, Map 1). DSI has a work
force of 25,700 permanent staff (1983), of whom 3,240 are technical staff. Of
the latter, 25% are located at headquarters. DSI has a substantial annual
budget accounting for 6 to 7% of the total national budget and 20 to 25Z of
that allocated for capital development. Some 30 to 40% of this is devoted to
agriculture. DSI's completion of irrigation and drainage works averaged
50,000 ha annually during the early and mid-1970s declined to less than 40,000
ha annually in the period 1978 to 1980, and has increased to about 80,000 ha
since 1981. Although DSI carries out most construction by contract, it
maintains in the regions a large machinery pool mostly for maintenance work
and workshops fully equipped for the servicing and repair of this machinery.
Most of this equipment has served its useful life and the pool is being
replenished from the proceeds of the ASAL.
4.03     Consulting Engineering Services to Assist DSI. The work program of
DSI under the proposed project would be implemented with the assistance of a
domestic consulting firm, who would advise on programming, preparing and
implementing the project. This domestic firm would also assist DSI in the
review of its annual investment programs, new and ongoing. DSI would be
further assisted by an independent, reviewing consulting firm. Th..e
consultancy arrangements have been agreed and would be financed under the
ASAL. The balance of the cost would be met from the proposed project. The
duties of the consulting firm, whose tenure would extend to about six years
would include the following:
(a)    review all existing feasibility studies for completed and ongoing
irrigation projects and their drainage components;
(b)    based on the above review, summarize their findings in the form of an
inception report, which would include a priority ranking of all
drainage projects based on agreed criteria (Annex 3, page 2);
(c)    assist DSI in preparing groups of priority drainage projects for
timely and coordinated implementation;
(d)    assist DSI in carrying out field studies, and preparing final designs
and bidding documents for the selected drainage projects;
(e)    assist DSI in the supervision of construction, if called upon to do
so; and
(f)    review and evaluate DSI's public investment programs according to
agreed criteria, and set up monitoring and evaluation programs for
the investment portfolio.



-29-
General Directorate of Rural Services
4.04     The irrigation department of GDRS, then known as TOPRAKSU, was
established in 1952 as the irrigation and drainage section of the Ministry of
Agriculture. It was reorganized as the General Directorate of Soil
Conservation and Farm irrigation within the Ministry of Village Affairs in
164. With the integration of the latter Ministry and the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forests, in June 1984, into the new Ministry of Agriculture,
Forests, and Rural Affairs (MAFRA), this Directorate was merged with the
Directorate G:neral for Rural Services with the following responsibilities:
(a)    to carry out on-farm works on State irrigation schemes;
(b)    to develop small water resources (up to 500 1/) for irrigation;
(c)    to carry out surveys, soil analyses, soil classification and soil
maps;
(d)    to conduct research on soil, water, plants and fertilizer;
(e)    to control erosion and floods in arable land, and maintain soil
productivity;
(f)    to provide technical assistance, farmer training and credit for soil
and water conservation practices; and
(g)    to plan and implement land consolidation.
The irrigation department of GDRS consists of a central organization (Annex 4,
Chart 2), 18 regional planning offices (Annex 4, Chart 2), three project
offices, 11 research centers, three training centers, a machinery and supply
directorate, a cartographic directorate, an operation unit for Urfa province
(stone-clearing) and several provincial offices/work units. Present permanent
staff total about 9,200, of whom about 1,200 are technical, 800 are
semi-skilled and 7,200 are laborers. About 20Z of the technical staff are
located at headquarters. GDRS's budget for 1985 for the irrigation department
was about halt of DSI's budget for irrigation works. The irrigation
department of GDRS would be responsible for the implementation of the project
and its department chief would be designated as the project director.
4.05     Consulting Engineering Services for GDRS.  The proposed project of
GDRS would be implemented, with the assistance of a domestic consulting firm
who would advise on programming, preparing and implementing an on-farm
development project, consisting of subsurface collector drains, subsurface
drainage network, land reclamation and access roads. The domestic firm would
also assist in the review of GDRS's annual investment program. GDRS would be
further assisted by an independent reviewing consulting firm. The consultancy
and financing arrangements have already been agreed and would be financed
under the A&IT. The balance cost would be met from the proceeds of the
proposed project. The duties of the consulting firm whose tenure would extend
to about six years, would include the following:
(a)    review annual and five-year program of draiaage, land reclamation and
access roads. (These programs would be prepared by a separate
consulting firm employed by DSI and would be based on a review of all
existing feasibility studies for completed and ongoing irrigation
projects and their drainage components).



-30-
(b)    assist GDRS in establishing priority annual investment programs,
based on agreed criteria, and coordinated with the programs proposed
in the DSI for the respective years (paras 4.03 (b and c));
(c)    carry out detailed field surveys and field investigations including
but not limited to the following:
-  topographical surveys;
-  pedological surveys;
-  hydrogeological surveys;
-  soil investigations; and
-  infiltration and other tests.
(d)    these surveys and investigations would be sufficient in nature and
extent to permit final design of the farm drainage and subsurface
drainage systems;
(e)    prepare final designs, bidding documents and cost estimates for the
selected groups for ICB, and assist GDRS in evaluating the bids;
(f)    assist GDRS in the supervision of construction if called upon to do
so; and
(g)    review and evaluate GDRS Public Investment Program according to
agreed criteria, and to set up monitoring and evaluation programs for
the investment portfolio.
B. Operation and Maintenance
4.06     Role of DSI & GDRS.  DSI has responsibility for constructing
headworks, distribution canals and the large bulk of the surface drainage
systems including main, secondary and some tertiary drains as well as pumping
stations, and GDRS is basically responsible for on-fa-m development works.
While DSI's charter of activities includes operation and maintenance of all
works constructed by them, GDRS has neither authority nor funds for
maintenance of the on-farm works constructed under its control.
4.07     DSI's O&M Staff.  Among its 13 departments in the Read Office, DSI
maintains a regular department for operation and maintenance, which is headed
by an officer of the level of a regional director and manned at various levels
by experienced officers and supporting staff. In the field there are 25
regional directorates, each having an O&M section in the regional of :ice and
an O&M section in the field organization.  For every 10,000 ha of irrigated
land, DSI has one O&M field engineering unit. During the peak season, hired
temporary labor can also be employed depending upon requirements. The
engineers would be provided with motor vehicles and technicians with
motorcycles. Mobile/stationary wireless sets are provided for communications
purposes. When the size of the project reaches 35,000 ha the O&M F'ield
Engineering Division, which is headed by an engineer-in-chief, the niumber of
personnel are increased in proportion to those given for a Field Engineering
Unit of 10,000 ha. In general, DSI has organized satisfactory O&M units which
are capable of handling day-to-day maintenance problems provided the required
equipment and funds are made available to them at the right time.



-31-
4.08     Assessment of O&M Requirements.  Each year, a team of O&M engineers
visits all the works being operated in each regional directorate and makes an
on the spot assessment of the maintenance needs. For electrical and/or
mechanical installation, suitable electrical and/or mechanical engineers are
included in the team. After inspection and necessary discussions, their
findings are presented in an examination report which gives a brief
description of the various categories of works, the nature and magnitude of
the maintenance problems, the suggested remedial measures and the funds
required to meet the situation. This examination report is reviewed in the
regional office and then in the DSI General Directorate and forms the basis
for allocation of funds for O&M.
4.09     Future Needs of O&M and Extension Services.  The expenditure on
drainage systems is 50% of the total on both irrigation and drainage. The
actual annual cost for 1984 for drainage only in 1985 prices has been worked
out as TL 10,186/ha, or $18.86/ha (Annex 4, Table 1). Future needs at full
development are estimated to be 50% higher in order to make up for deficient
maintenance in the past and to maintain an acceptable quality in the future.
These are shown in Annex 4, Table 2 which also shows the incremental cost of
0&M at full development in 1985 prices. These O&M costs as summarized below
are about 1.5% of the average investment costs in current prices. The
Government would take measures to ensure adequate maintenance of facilities
constructed or rehabilitated under the project. DSI has adequate maintenance
staff, and is fully capable of providing appropriate maintenance provided the
required equipment and funds are made available. GDRS has no maintenance
staff and is expected to organize farmer cooperatives to maintain on-farm
facilities which it constructs. However it does administer a budget for
repairs of facilities that it constructs. Most of the GDRS drainage
facilities constructed under this project would be subsurface drains and would
not require regular maintenance. However, collector drains constructed under
the project would require occasional maintenance and repairs. GDRS would
carry out these periodic repairs and maintenance from the funds available
under the allocations for repairs. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that GDRS will make arrangements for and provide on a timely
basis adequate funds for the maintenance of collector drains which it
constructs (para 8.01 (g)). In addition, under a recent Bank project (Loan
2405-TU), agricultural extension services similar to the Training and Visit
extension methods are being set up in 16 provinces and are expected to be
extended throughout Turkey through similar projects in the future. Government
would be required to provide adequate extension services and facilities in the
project areas completed under the proposed project. Assurance for these
arrangements were obtained during negotiations (para 8.01 (g)).
C. Accounts and Audit
4.10     The accounting and auditing departments of DS- and GDRS are well
staffed, are experienced, and have satisfactorily discharged their functions
for other Bank projects. These offices would each maintain separate accounts
for the project. Staff of DSI would prepare at the end of each quarter a
detailed statement of project expenditures during the period (in an agreed
format) and submit such statement to the Bank within 45 days after the end of
each quarter. Such statements would, inter alia, be used as basis for
supervising the progress and costs of force account works. Annual statements
of receipts and expenditures would be prepared and overall financial repo-ting
and auditing will be in accordance with the Guidelines for Financial Reporting



-32-
and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank issued in March 1982. An
annual audit would be carried out by the Treasury Controller and the audit
report submitted to the Bank within nine months of the end of each fiscal
year.  Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations (para 8.01
(h)).
D. Project Monitoring and Completion Report
4.11     Project Monitoring and Key Project Indicators.  DSI and GDRS, would
submit in quarterly and annual reports to the Bank, the information necessary
to measure systematically project execution against the proposed
implementation schedule, and project performance after completion of
construction against project benefits foreseen during appraisal. The reports
would include data on the progress of construction of all physical facilities
under various project components, progress in the procurement of consulting
services, and data on project expenditures. Agricultural data indicating the
areas reclaimed and drained, cropping patterns applied, crop yields and
output, and information on the operation and maintenance costs of irrigation
and drainage works would be submitted annually. DSI would monitor and
evaluate the data on groundwater in waterlogged areas (para 3.11), cropping
patterns, inputs and yields (para 5.05) and submit them to the Bank with the
annual reports. In addition, DSI and GDRS would submit quarterly all
financial and other data on physical progress. DSI would be the lead agency
for compiling the quarterly and the annual reports. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations for the timely implementation of the physical, technical,
agricultural and financial monitoring and evaluation and submission of the
reports in a format acceptable to the Bank (para 8.01 (i)).
4.12     Proiect Completion Report.  Immediately after completion of the
project, but in any case not later than six months after the closing date of
September 30, 1990, DSI and GDRS would prepare and submit to the Bank a
project completion report. DSI would be the lead agency for compiling the
report. It would report on the implementation and operations of the project,
its costs and its existing and projected derived benefits. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations for their timely submission (para 8.01 (i)).
V. PRODUCTION, MARKET ARRANGEMENTS, PROSPECTS AND PRICES
A. Production
5.01     The proposed investments would restore existing irrigated areas to
full production and prevent further deterioration of soils and reduction of
crop production by eliminating waterlogging and salinity, permitting
cultivation of abandoned land, and restoring yields from currently depressed
levels to the levels in the fully drained adjacent areas. The production
impact of the investments is estimated on the basis of crop and farm models
representing conditions in the Coastal and Inland regions (para 6.01).
5.02     Lifting the waterlogging and salinity constraints would have their
main effect on crop yields whic4 would increase primarily through better soil
aeration, restoration of optimum planting dates, and more efficient use of
inputs, seed, fertilizer and chemicals. In approving individual projects, DSI
and GDRS, assisted by consultants, would assess the variation of existing
yields under waterlogged and non-waterlogged conditions and similar soils
within the irrigation perimeter, using existing records and the results of
periodic monitoring and field surveys. For the purpose of analysis, future
yields in improved areas after removing the waterlogging constraint would be



-33-
those already obtained by farmers under similar soil conditions in the
non-waterlogged areas of the same perimeters. In contrast, failure to
overcome waterlogging without the proposed investments would result in a
gradual further decline of yields. The yields in this report are based on DSI
irripation census data, DSI sample observations, and field observa,ions by the
mission. Moreover these yield assumptions are justified because soils in
waterlogged and non-waterlogged areas are essentially the same. Present and
projected yields, with and without drainage, are shown below;
Table 5.1: Present and Projected Yields

5.03     It is also assumed that the measures to be implemented under the
proposed project would enable the prevailing cropping patterns in neighboring
areas under similar conditions to be maintained in areas improved. In the
coastal region, cotton would dominate the patterns and the small rice area
would decline. In the inland region, wheat would dominate and fallow would be
converted to fodder crops (mainly alfalfa) and pulses (mainly broad beans and
lentils). The patterns of major crops in currently waterlogged areas, at
present and in the future after drain installations, are represented as
follows:

5.04     About 55? of completed and ongoing DSI irrigation projects lie in
areas with conditions typical of the Coastal region and about 45X lie in areas
typical of the Inland region. Based on DSI monitoring data, in the Coastal
region about 40% of the irrigation area within perimeters currently is
affected by waterlogging and salinity; and in the Inland region about 26%.
The gradual rise in subsurface water tables over the ten-year period of
monitoring indicate that the area subject to waterlogging and salinity without
the proposed measures by 1991 would amount to an estimated 440,000 ha in
completed DSI projects. The first time-slice investments under the proposed
project would remove these constraints from half of the area (220,000 ha).
The future additional area which would eventually become waterlogged without
the proposed investments, which is difficult to quantify, has not been
estimated. Accordingly, the benefit areas for the analysis are as follows:

First Time-Slice            144          76      220
5.05     Agricultural production would be monitored by periodic measuring of
harvested yields.  DSI is already collecting this type of data.  Under the
project, DSI would evaluate its data to establish historical yield levels and
trends in waterlogged and non-waterlogged areas. In addition, DSI would
continue to monitor and evaluate yields on a Deriodic basis. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that complete recording of the sample surveys of
crop yields would be carried out and supplied to the Bank on a yearly basis
with the Annual report (para 8.01 (j)). Present and future crop production in
the areas to be improved under the first time-slice are summarized as follows:

B.  Market Prospects and *nputs Availability
,.06     Turkey's growing domestic requirenents and competitive export market
for selected commodities would absorb the incremental production from the
drained areas. Rising incomes and growing urban population will continue to
stimulate domestic consumption which is generally below European per capita
levels. Turkey has established export markets in Europe and the Middle East.
Despite increasing competition in these markets, Turkey is expected to
maintain its comparative advantage in certain commodities and markets. Recent
trends and market prospects for Turkey for the main commodities where remedial
measures are proposed in the Coastal and Inland regions are given in Annex 5
(Tables 1-4).



-35-
5.07     Cotton.  Over the past decade, annual lint production in Turkey has
been about 500,000 tons per year of medium and long staple cotton, of which
Turkey exported 20-40%. The anticipated production increment under the
project of 82,500 tons of lint per year would be readily absorbed by Turkey's
export and domestic markets. The additional byproducts would help supply the
growing domestic markets for edible oils and livestock feed. The main part of
Turkey's production is sold as raw material for the expanding domestic yarn,
fabric and garment industries. Local yarn and cotton goods sales are growing
in line with increasing per capita incomcs. Although Turkish exporters face
strong competition abroad, especially with expansion of the EEC, Turkish yarn,
fabric and garment exports to Europe are expanding in relation to Turkey's
high yarn and fabric quality and competitive pricing. To encourage exports,
the Government recently reduced the export tax on cotton. In 1984, lint
cotton exports were valued at nearly US$170 million, while yarn, fabric and
garment exports (largely cotton) were valued at over US$1.0 billion. In the
long term, world market prices for lint are expected to increase moderately,
further strengthening the cotton market in Turkey. Most farmers sell their
seed cotton to a marketing cooperative or private ginnery. Ginneries in and
near the producing areas currently are operating below installed capacities.
5.08     Wheat.  Turkey has become a marginal net exporter of cereals.  Wheat
comprises two-thirds of Turkey's 25 million ton annual cereal production.
However, wheat, which is the main cereal consumed domestically, has been
imported in increasing quantities, largely soft bread wheat for domestic
consumption. Incremental wheat production under the project of about 212,000
tons (soft wheat) would offset a portion of imports. Farmers in the project
areas market wheat through private traders and local flour mills. About 15
percent of internal trade is handled by the state enterprise Soils Products
Office (TMO) which is being assisted by the Bank's Grain Storage Project (Loan
No. 1742-TU).  Thus, farmers would have no difficulty marketing their
incremental production through existing channels.
5.09     Pulses and Broad Beans.  Since  1980, Turkey has increased pulse
production by about 75%, to 1.4 million tons in 1984.  Over 60% of the
increase has gone towards expanding exports (to Europe, North Africa, and
Asia); the balance has been sold to meet rising domestic requirements.
Although broad beans comprise a small part of total pulse production, broad
beans are increasingly popular pulse crops in irrigated areas because of ease
of cultivation with increased availabiliry of mechanization. Incremental
production under the project of 90,000 tons per year at full development would
comprise less than 10% of current pulse production. Farmers market pulses
through private traders and the THO, who would be able to handle the
anticipated increases.
5.10     Fodder (alfalfa).  While grazing has been the traditional basis for
animal production in Turkey, requirements for fodder, feed grains and feed
concentrates are increasing rapidly in response to aniimal fattening programs,
export demands for animal products, and domestic demand for poultry products.
Alfalfa is a relatively high value fodder crop currently grown in sugar beet
areas where intensive animal husbandry is increasing through availability of
sugar beet by-products for feed. Incremental production of 80,000 tons (dry)
under the project would be consumed iL parc on local farms and in part sold
through private traders.



-36-
5.11     Chemical Inputs.  Turkey currently imports about 20Z of its
fertilizers. Thus, the large bulk of fertilizer use is served by domestic
production. Fertilizer is produced by both public and private sector firms.
Tvo State Economic Enterprises (DONATIM and SEKER - SEKER related only to
sugarbeet production) presently have a monopoly on fertilizer distribution.
They provide timely and adequate service, though at high cost to the economy
and not necessarily optimal nutrient packages. Thus farmers should encounter
few problems in obtaining fertilizers through existing arrangements. In the
future, the range and variety of available fertilizers should increase, as a
result of Government's intention (supported by the ASAL) to open the
distribution system to private trade on a phased basis beginning in 1986, and
to end the SEE's monopoly on importations. Pesticides are imported ana sold
to farmers by both public and private sector firms.
5.12     Seeds.  To reduce constraints on yield progressions, in 1983 and
1984, the Government adopted measures to encourage the development of a
private sector seeds industry through foreign seed companies' participation in
joint ventures, relaxed importation, testing, and certification procedures,
and by deregulating seed pricing. These measures to date have produced
significant results in attracting the establishment of private sector seed
companies. Wheat and barley seed production is expected to remain largely in
the public sector since private marketing of these seeds has been typically
less profitable than other seed production. To meet the need for wheat and
barley seeds, the Government in 1983 formed a new State Economic Enterprise,
the Turkish Agricultural Enterprise (TIGEM) out of predecessor institutions,
which will operate on commercial principles and become a self-sustaining
entity. In addition, the Government has agreed to design a national seeds
industry development plan, to assist establishing a coordinating association
for private seed producers, and to turn over supply of certified
self-pollinators to fully commercialized certified seed growers.
C. Prices
5.13     Since 1980 Turkey's price policy Kas aimed at bringing the domestic
price structure in line with international price parities. Farmgate prices
which used to be significantly protected are now lower than their border price
equivalents (the ratio of the total value of tradeables at border prices to
the value at the prevailing farmgate prices increased from 0.850 in 1979 to
1.282 in 1982), and price relationships among commodities at the farmgate are
closer to the relationships at international prices. This price structure
will encourage exports and promote cropping patterns reflecting comparative
advantage.
5.14     Recently, the Government has taken important steps to rationalize
production price supports which during the 1970's had placed a heavy burden on
the budget. By end 1983, the number of announced supports had been reduced
from 25 to 13. The level of the announced prices is now set somewhat below
seasonally adjusted market prices. Consequently, the share of procurement at
official prices has been reduced, thus minimizing the distorting effect of
official intervention. A portion of this difference between export receipts
and farmgate prices is captured through export levies, earmarked for
agricultural development expenditures. An assessment of the efficacy of these
export levies will be carried out by MAFRA's APK under the ASAL.



-37-
5.15     Since 1980, the Government has instituted measures to reduce the
subsidies for pesticides, fertilizers, irrigation water, and deregulated
prices and liberalized imports for seeds and farm machinery. The subsidy was
eliminated for plant protection materials which are now sold to farmers at
cost. Seed prices and the pricing of agricultural machinery were deregulated
in 1984. Machinery prices subsequently declined, and some exporting
occurred. The Government also has increased irrigation water charges (para
6.06). Similarly the Government has been increasing retail fertilizer prices
periodically, with increases in 1984 of 50% in real terms and further
increases in February 1985. However, since c.i.f. spot prices were in a
cyclical upswing, the average retail subsidy in February 1985 was still 45X as
compared to 60X in 1983. Under the ASAL, the Government confirmed its
intention to phase out the remainder of the retail fertilizer subsidy by the
end of 1988. In August 1985 a further increase in prices of 17% in real terms
was announced. However, as a result of declining international fertilizer
prices, the August 1985 price announcements have effectively eliminated the
retail price subsidy--for the time being at least, on urea and DAP, while the
subsidies on the less important products have been reduced to between 10-20x.
VI. FARM INCOMES, FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND COST RECOVERY
A. Farm Incomes
6.01     To test the project's effect on farmers' incomes, twelve crop models
have been developed representing the most important crops grown with
irrigation, under waterlogged and non-waterlogged conditions, in the schemes
located in the coastal and inland regions of the country. Following the
observed cropping patterns in the irrigated areas, four farm models have also
been developed tc represent the waterlogged and non-waterlogged areas of the
selected typical irrigated schemes or perimeters. The farm models assume
gradual changes in yields after the drainage and on-farm development works
take place to remove waterlogging -- the constraint to production. Thus, the
farm models reflect in the without project situation a deterioration in yields
as waterlogging continues and increases due to the absence of or the existence
of non-functional surface or subsurface drainage. As drainage is introduced,
the deterioration of yields ceases.
6.02     The gross value of crop production has been calculated at constant
mid-1985 market prices. Production costs incl.ude all inputs also valued at
mid-1985 market prices, as well as hired labor valued at the present market
wage rate of TL 2,500 (US$4.63J per day. The existing water charge assessment
covering DSI's O&M costs has been included as an input cost. Benefits
attributable to the project start in year 2 after the works and on-farm
improvements havE been completed in year 1, and reach full development in year
5. Detailed farm budgets are shown in Annex 6, Tables 1-4. The income
analysis is sumwarized in Table 6.1 below, and is detailed in Annex 6, Table 5.

Net benefits (or net disposable farm revenue after project charges) at full
development over the without project situation increase three-fold in the
coastal waterlogged farm (2 ha) to TL 509 thousand (US$ 943). The coastal
areas are characterized by a long tradition in the use of irrigation and
intensive farming with high value crops. Substantial investments have taken
place in these areas over long periods; thus farmers are already oriented
towards high value crops both in waterlogged and non-waterlogged areas. On
the other hand, in the inland regions, farmers are oriented towards
traditional and low risk crops such as sugarbeet and wheat. With the
additional investments in drainage, farmers would be expected to shift to some
higher value crops to increase their incomes while covering repayment of such
investments. For the representative waterlogged inland faxMs (3 ha) the net
benefits increase five-fold in the future situation to TL 348 thousand (US$
645) but from a lower base than the coastal farms, as a result of the lower
productivity of Turkey's central and southcentral plains, where typically 40%
of the irrigated laud is in fallow due to poor drainage which, with the
improved conditions in the with project situation can increase cropping
intensity to 100Z.
6.03     Directly benefitted farmers within the irrigated perimeters of the
proposed project are expected to be about 72,000 in the coastal regions and
25,000 in the inland regions. Data on farm size distribution in the coastal
regions indicate that 70% of the land is in holdings of usually two plots and
averaging 2 ha per holding. The average farm size ranges from 1.8 ha in the
Alasehir perimeter to 2.7 ha in Menemen. In the inland regions, 65Z of the
land is in holdings of usually three plots and averaging 3 ha per holding.
This compares with national averages of 12% of the farmed area held by 30Z of
farmers having an average farm size of 2 ha in the Western Coastal Areas
(Agricultural Region II). Nationwide, 6% of the farmed area is held by 14% of
farmers in farms averaging 2 ha.



-39-
6.04     The benefitted farmers in the coastal regions would increase per
capita incomes solely from crop production activities (after all charges)
above the relative poverty level (RPL) but below the estimated per capita
GNP. Without the project, per capita incomes would decrease steadily over
time (the latter two indicators include incomes from all sources). In the
inland regions, per capita incomes with the project would increase but would
remain below the RPL. The level of charges therefore represents a balance
between farmer incentiLves to take up the investments and the public savings
needed by government for the sustainability of these projects (paras 6.10-6.12).
B. Project Charges and Cost Recovery
Introduction
6.05     The Government of Turkey is aware ot the problems it faces in
irrigation cost recovery and its importance as one mechanism for resource
mobilization in face of fiscal constraints. The Government has embarked on
increasing the level of assessed water charges to recover DSI's operation and
maintenance costs (O&M), and has made great strides in reducLng long standing
subsidies in the economy in general, as well as in agriculture. As the arable
land frontier was reached in the early 1970s through lateral exparsion of
cultivation, production growth since then has been primarily through
intensification of production. This was due mainly to increased yields and to
the reduction in fallowed lands which accounted for up to one-third of the
expansion of cultivated area. Government's main objective is to complete the
transition from a highly subsidized, protected and inefficient system of
primary production to one which is essentially self-reliant, financially
independent and responsive to policy signals and incentives. The key
instruments of Government's policy emphasis which affect the proposed project
are policy reforms to: (i) reduce producer subsidization while maintaining
adequate incentives and (ii) rationalize public investment with primary focus
on irrigation, the key to intensification as lateral expansion is being
exhausted.
Cost Recovery by DSI and GDRS
6.06     Under the IAEE Irrigation Project (Loan 2433-TU, FY83), the
government agreed to (i) adjust DSI capital recovery charges under existing
legislation to include interest, (ii) progressively increase DSI water charge
assessments for operation and maintenance to 100I (by 1986) of the actual cost
of operating and maintaining such facilities during the previous year; and
(iii) increase penalties for overdue payments. It was further agreed that
action would be taken to permit GDRS to recover its capital costs for on-farm
works over 20 years. Considerable progress has been made to implement these
agreements. DSI's O&M assessments were increased by 254% in real terms by
1984 over 1978 levels. Beginning in 1983, the Government also adopted a much
stiffer schedule of penalties for late payment. Under the new rules, if
payment is late by one year, a total penalty is levied equal to 54X of the
initial assessment. Before 1983, the penalty was a flat 10%. A further
increase of the penalty rate to 75Z took effect in mid-1985. New legislation
was enacted in May 1985 allowing GDRS, for the first time, to recover its



-40-
costs. The required implementing rules and regulations, however, require
Council of Ministers' approval. Draft regulations have been prepared and the
process of review and approval is underway. Arrangements satisfactory to the
Bank for carrying out GDRS cost recovery obligations (expected to be met
through Council of Ministers' approval cf the regulations referred to above)
would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para 8.02 (a)).
6.07     DSI's actual recoveries for capital costs have increased from 35% of
amounts due in 1978 to 51% in 1983. Recoveries for O&M costs on due assessed
charges have increased from 49% in 1978 to 74% in 1983. Annual fluctuations
seem to be linked to the relationship of inflation and the level of the
penalties for late payments. In the past, assessed charges for O&M were lower
than the previous year's actual O&M cost, resulting in an average rate of cost
recovery of 27% between 1978 and 1983. With much increased assessment levels
(para 6.06, the situation should be redressed. During negotiations assurances
were received that the Government would take all necessary actions to improve
collection of DSI accounts, including instituting appropriate legal procedures
against users whose accounts are more than twelve months overdue (para 8.01
(k)).
6.08     The charges assumed in the rent and cost recovery analysis follow
DSI's current practices and the progressive improvements agreed under the IAEE
project (para 6.10). DSI's O&M costs are charged in full annually to all of
the farmers within a given ;rrigated perimeter, as are capital costs over 40
years at an imputed 5% interest rate. With regard to GDRS it is assumed that
the required implementing rules and regulations under the new iegislation
(para 6.06) will conform to the agreement under the IAEE project, for recovery
of costs, including interest, amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years
from the completion of the works. For current financial calculations, we are
assuming that the GDRS cost recovery regulations will provide for capital cost
recovery over 20 years, with one year of grace and with a 5% rate of interest.
6.09     The irrigation cost recovery mechanism cannot appropriately be viewed
only on the basis of direct water charge assessments on farmers. All farm
land owners are subject to an annual tax of 0.3% of the assessed value of
their land. Field observations indicate that the assessed values are about
25% of the market value of the land. In addition, a withholding tax was
introduced in 1981 providing for a 5% tax on all crop output sold and 2% on
all animal and animal product sales. This tax was intended to compensate for
the difficulty in collection of taxes on agricultural income, but also serves
to reduce and to a certain extent correct the remaining deficiencies in cost
recovery (such as the long amortization period and low interest rate for DSI
capital cost recovery).
6.10     Assurances were received during negotiations, which provide for
maintaining under the current project cost recovery in accordance with the
agreements reached under the IAEE project (para 8.01 (1)). In the case of DSI
charges, the Government would (a) annually assess water charges from users of
irrigation facilities constructed by DSI least equal to: (i) the actual cost
of operating and maintaining such facilities during the previous fiscal year
plus, and (ii) the amount required for recovery of capital costs of such
facilities, including reasonable interest thereon, amortized over a period not



-41-
exceeding fifty years; and (b) take all appropriate action to collect amounts
due on such accounts, including instituting appropriate legal procedures
against users whose accounts are in delay for more than twelve months. In the
case of GDRS, the Government would take necessary action to assess and take
steps to collect from farmers receiving on-farm development investments under
the Project the cost of such investments, including interest, through periodic
payments amortized over a period not exceeding twenty years from the
completion of such investments.
Cost Recovery at the Farm Level
6.11     The implications for public revenues and farmers' incomes in the
recovery of the capital and recurrent costs of both DSI (surface) and GDRS
(surface and subsurface) drainage investments are analyzed below. All data
are in present value terms, discounted at 12Z over the 40 year evaluation
period and in mid-1985 prices, with the following assumptions:
(i) present levels of assessments for ongoing O&M activities (79%) are
increased to full levels by 1986 in keeping with government policy
but are not attributable to the project (para 6.07);
(ii) the incremental activities of O&M for DSI's drainage activities are
costed fully and at an increased level in the quality of these O&M
activities. These charges are applied to all the farmers withi- the
perimeter;
(iii) the investments in subsurface drainage are recovered from the actual
beneficiaries in 137,500 ha for the first time slice; and
(iv) the investments in surface drainage are recovered fully and are
spread over the entire area for the first time slice of 668,000 ha as
is the practice followed by DSI whereby capital improvements and
increases in O&M costs are spread over and charged to the full area
of each irrigation scheme or perimeter.
6.12     The rent and cost recovery analysis has been applied to farm models
in waterlogged and non-waterlogged areas in the coastal and inland regions.
The rent recovery index takes into account several factors. Family labor was
fully costed at the alternative of outside employment as unskilled farm labor,
as there exist possibilities for employment at the current daily wage of
TL 2,500 (USS 4.63). A return to management has been imputed at 20Z of the
annual net farm revenue. No allowance has been imputed for risk or
uncertainty because the crops grown are annual, not perishable, relatively
well known to farmers and because there exists an active market for the supply
of inputs and farming custom services. Furthermore, with ample water supplies
and the elimination of waterlogging, there is not a great risk in water
deficiencies due to drought periods. The results are summarized in Table 6.2
below and detailed in Annex 6, Table 6.

and TL 7,424 (US$18) for the recovery of investments.  It also contributes
annually during 20 years TL 185 thousand ($343) for the recovery of GDRS
investments. All combined charges represent 52% of the farm rent and recover
65Z of public outlays. In addition the non-waterlogged coastal farm
contributes 33Z of all DSI public outlays because DSI recoveries are spread
over the whole perimeter. The 3 ha farms on the waterlogged inland areas
(IIA) pay to DSI annual charges for O&M of TL 33 thousand (US$61) and of
TL 7,238 (US$13) for capital recovery. In addition, recovery for GDRS
investments amount annually to TL 278 thousand (USS 515). The farmts combined
charges represent about 75% of the farm's rent and recover 65X of public
outlays. The farm in the non- waterlogged area (IIC), contributes 38% to
1,SI's public outlays. These rates indicate that the farmers would have
sufficient financial incentive to achieve projected yields and cropping
intensities (the financial rate of return against public investments for the 2
ha coastal waterlogged farm (IA) is estimated at 18%, and for the 3 ha inland
waterlogged farm (IIA) at 14%). The absolute level of project charges during
the recovery period amounts to $433 annually for the coastal farm and $589 for
the inland farm. The level of charges represents a balance between farmer
incentives and the public savings needed by Government for the sustainability
of these investments in the irrigated perimeters.
Cost Recovery at the Aggregate Level
6.14     First Time Slice.  With the objective of the proposed project to
rehabilitate drainage in an area of 668,000 ha of which 220,000 ha suffer from
major drainage problems, an aggregate calculation for the first time slice has
been carried out, after phasing in the investments, to ascertain the overall
impact of the proposed undertaking. As data in Annex 6, Table 7 indicate, the
coastal regions can contribute 53% to the public outlays with the proposed
repayment arrangements, while the inland regions contribute 55Z, for a
weighted overall cost recovery index of 54%.

VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Benefits
7.01     The proposed project would support rationalization of the public
investment program for drainage and on-farm development. The proposed
investments would increase crop output from existing irrigation schemes under
growing domestic consumption and industrial requirements and demand in
competitive export markets. The investments would thus increase employment
and household incomes in farms and market centers. The value of future
incremental production in currently affected areas 'benefit areas) under the
first time slice comprises the quantifiable benefits treated in the economic
analysis below. Additional benefits which are attributable to the future area
which would eventually become waterlogged without the proposed investments are
difficult to quantify and have not been included. In addition, the proposed
project would benefit the irrLgation and drainage subsector by strengthening
operating and investment management through provision of training and
streamlining of investment selection criteria used by DSI and GDRS.
7.02     Beneficiaries.  Approximately 97,000 farmers own and operate land in
the 220,000 ha currently subject to waterlogging and salinity under the first
time slice. These and neighboring farmers operating land which without the
proposed investments would eventually become waterlogged would benefit.
7.03     Employment Impact.  At full development, annual on-farm employment in
the currently waterlogged areas would increase by about 7 million mandays per
year, about 20Z of current on-farm employment within the DSI irrigation
perimeters. This increase would be absorbed largely by farm household
members, and in part by an increase in hired labor.
7.04     Foreign Exchange Impact.  Additional exports of cotton and pulses and
fewer wheat imports at full development (first time slice) would generate
potential incremental foreign exchange earnings/savings amounting to about
US$177 million equivalent, as follows:
Table 7.1 Estimated Foreign Exchange Earnings/Savings
'000 tons        USS million
Cotton lint                     82.5              122.7
Wheat                          212.0               29.5
Broad beans (shelled)           90.0               24.8
Total                                           177.0
While a portion of cotton and pulse production would be sold locally, the
incremental sales would enable additional exports from other parts of Turkey.
In the project areas, rice production would decline by about 21,000 tons, with
the result that additional rice imports valued at about US$10.8 million would
be needed to meet the current level of domestic demand. In addition, the
incremental output under the project would require additional 30,000 tons of
fertilizer valued at the border at US$6.6 million. Assuming that all
incremental fertilizers would be imported, net foreign exchange
earnings/savings under the project would amount to about US$160 million
equivalent per year.



-44-
B. Economic Analysis
7.05     The impact on the Turkish economy in terms of economic rates of
return (ERRs) and net present values (NPVs) would be evaluated by the
Goverument using agreed criteria as a basis for selecting each investment
(Annex 3, page 2). The analysis for this appraisal covers:
(a) six representative individual projects, five in the coastal zone
covering the major share of the waterlogged areas and one covering a
substantial area in the inland zone; and
(b) the first time-slice investments, overall.
In addition, indicative ERR and NPV values are estimated for the entire core
program. The quantifiable net benefits from incremental crop production are
evaluated on the basis of the typical farm budgets for the inland and coastal
zones, after adjustments for taxes, subsidies and debt service. The
investment and operating costs in each case are based on unit rates including
capital and operating costs for equipment. The cost estimates thus include
the full construction costs taking into account equipment financed both from
the project and other sources. Price contingencies are excluded. In the
irrigated areas in Turkey's coastal and inland regions, farm mechanization
levels and household labor mobility are relatively high. Although rural
household members are generally underemployed, they receive opportunities to
participate in the rural labor force at prevailing wages which are freely
determined. In view of the above, future household family labor in the
analysis is valued at the prevailing unskilled labor wage rate. The analyses
extend over a 25-year period, including the initial six-year implementation
period and four years thereafter to realize the anticipated level of benefits
at full development.
7.06     Economic Prices.  Farm production and inputs are valued at farmgate.
Farmgate prices for internationally traded commodities or their products
(cotton, wheat, rice, and broad beans) and fertilizer inputs are derived from
projected border prices based on World Bank price projections, prevailing
trade parities in Turkey, and recenc Turkish export/import values where
available (Annex 7, Tables 1-5). Border prices for broad beans, not covered
in the World Bank projections, are based on recent unit export values.
Adjustments are made for transport, handling, and processing costs between
border and farmgate. For pesticides, which are imported with no restrictions
or tariffs other than the value added tax (10%) at sale point, 90% of the
prevailing prices paid by farmers is used. Prevailing farmgate prices are
used for other farm commodities and inputs. Economic farmgate prices used in
the analysis are sunnarized in Annex 7 (Table 6).
7.07     ERR and NPV.  Based on the above assumptions, the estimated ERRs and
NPVs would be as follows; details are at Annex 7 (Tables 7-13).

/1  Estimated assuming opportunity cost of capital (0CC) at 12%.
Tne generally high rates of return, particularly in the coastal region,
confirm the relatively high benefits and short gestation periods for on-farm
investments within areas already supported by irrigation infrastructure. In
the inland region Konya Cumra project, despite the anticipated yield
increases, a high per hectare investment cost coupled with relatively low
output value and high cost of mechanization for the predominant crops has
resulted in a low ERR. Individual projects with appraised ERRs such as this
would not be selected for on-farm investments. The range of results indicate
the necessity for the Government to screen individual proposals with the aim
of funding only those proposals which would maximize the total NPV withiu
available resources.
7.08     Sensitivity Analysis.  The analysis indicates that satisfactory
returns would be achieved on most individual subprojects and for the project
overall, even with substantial increases in investment and operating costs.
For example, for the first time-slice project and the coastal region projects
analyzed, investment costs could increase by 50X or more before the ERR would
be unacceptable. The benefits are sensitive to variation in assumed yield
levels and prices. However, the assumed yield levels have already been
achieved in similar areas not affected by waterlogging. Possible yield
improvements attributable to use of improved technology have not been taken
into account. Changes in international prices would more likely affect the
cropping pattern than the overall economic viability, as existing conditions
encourage farmers to cultivate high value crops and make efficient use of
requisite inputs. Thus, the economic benefits from the proposed investment
project are relatively secure.



-46-
C. Risks
7.09     The proposed project would entail lower risk than many others in
Turkey because it would support tested technical improvements in areas already
supported by major irrigation infrastructure. Projected cropping practices
and yield levels for the areas to be improved already are achieved in adjacent
areas not effected by waterlogging and salinity. Domestic and export market
prospects are good and marketing channels are well established.
7.10     The main risks to achieving project objectives and sustaining
efficient development are institutional:
(a) Availability of funding for the Irrigation and Drainage subsector and
within the subsector priority allocation of resources to drainage and
on-farm development;
(b) Government's capacity to prepare, appraise and select priority
investments;
(c) DSI and GDRS's ability to coordinate overlapping implementation plans
and schedules; and
(d) Availability of adequate funding for O&M.
7.11     Measures are included to minimize these risks.  Under the ASAL, the
Government has agreed to maintain 1OZ of total public investment for
agriculture (of which 66X has traditionally been allocated for irrigation and
drainage). The Government also agreed to accord the highest priority to an
agreed core program of drainage and on-farm development investments within the
budget allocations for irrigation and drainage (para 3.22). If a shortfall in
annual program funding should occur, selected subprojects in the project could
be deferred, thus extending project completion without jeopardizing the
realization of individual project benefits or subsector objectives. In
addition, current economic conditions are substantially improved over
conditions under which some projects were delayed in the past, and the
Government has undertaken measures to improve recovery of investment and
operating costs. Since it has been agreed that the financing plans and the
requisite budget provisions based thereon would be made according to an agreed
timetable to be reviewed with the Bank each year, there would be sufficient
time to adjust the investment program so as to maximize benefits, taking
account of any risk of shortfalls in funding available to carry out project
investments.
7.12     The Government has confirmed its resolve to rationalize investment
priorities in the face of limited resources and political pressures.
Provisions are made under the project for institution building to improve the
capacity of implementing agencies in preparation, planning, design and review
of proposals. Consultants are to be engaged under the ASAL who are expected
to make a major contribution to increasing the capacities of DSI and GDRS to
carry out preparation, design and selection of proposals; continuation of
these consultant services would be financed under the proposed project. DSI
and GDRS responsibilities under the project have been delineated so as to



-47-
minimize the necessity for coordination during implementation. DSI and GDRS
implementation plans and schedules would be agreed under the investment review
process. The proposed project also provides for training of DSI and GDRS
staff. DSI and GDRS would appraise and select the individual proposals using
criteria and methodology acceptable to the Bank.
7.13     DSI's regional maintenance sections are adequately staffed, well
experienced, and have made effective use of maintenance resources and funds.
The Government has consistently budgeted funds for recurring O&M costs, but
OM has been constrained by lack of foreign exchange for purchasing equipment
needed for major rehabilitation of channels. Equipment now on hand is
overused, with more than 90X of the existing items older than 5 years and over
40S older than 10 years. The ASAL includes US$111 million for purchasing the
required equipment needed to remove this constraint; while other associated
costs for rehabilitation of the system are being financed from the proposed
project.
VIII. ASSURANCES AND AGREEMENTS
8.01     During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government that:
(a) consulting and reviewing engineering firms financed initially
under the ASAL to assist DSI and GDRS would be maintained
throughout the implementation period with additional financing
from the proposed project (paras 3.13 and 3.14);
(b) subprojects proposed for financing under this project would be
selected from an agreed list (para 3.16);
(c) subprojects for the first year of implementation (rehabilitation
of surface drains) would be submitted for Bank approval in early
1986. The program of the selection of subprojects for financing
beyond the first year of implementation would be governed by the
folloving procedures: prior to initiating procurement for the
second year's subprojects, the Government assisted by the
Consulting Firms would prepare and select a program based on
agreed selection criteria, which would be submitted to the Bank
for review and approval along with the procurement documents; the
same procedure would be followed during the succeeding years of
implementation (para 3.19);
(d) Government would make appropriate arrangements to provide the
remaining funds required for the project, and submit to the Bank
for its review by September 30 each year an updated financing
plan including revised schedule of estimated expenditures, taking
into account the effects of inflation on costs (para 3.22);
(e) civil works consisting of installation of subsurface drains,
reclamation of saline land, construction of access roads,
facilities for O&M and research stations would be procured under
ICB procedures consistent with the "Guidelines for Procurement
under World Bank Loan and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in
May 1985 (Bank Guidelines) (paras 3.25 and 3.27);



-48-
(f) Government will establish a special account in the Central Bank
of Turkey to deal exclusively with eligible expenditures under
the project (para 3.31);
(g) GDRS will make arrangements for and provide on a timely basis
adequate funds for the maintenance of collector drains which it
constructs; and Government will provide adequate extension
services and facilities in the completed project areas (para
4.09);
(h) maintenance of project accounts, preparation and use of
statements of expenditures and receipts, and the carrying out of
financial reporting and auditing will be as set out in para 4.10;
(i) regular monitoring and evaluation of key indicators will be
undertaken and quarterly and annual reports will be submitted in
a timely basis in format acceptable to the Bank (para 4.11); and
a project completion report will be submitted in a timely fashion
(para 4.12);
(j) complete recording of the sample surveys of crop yields would be
carried out and supplied to the Bank on a yearly basis with the
annual report (para 5.05);
(k) Government would take all necessary actions to improve collection
of DSI accounts, including instituting appropriate legal
procedures against users whose accounts are more than twelve
months overdue (para 6.07);
(1) DSI and GDRS cost recovery under the proposed project would
proceed under the criteria agreed under the IAEE project (para
6.10).
8.02     The following action would be condition of Loan Effectiveness:
(a) Goverrnent would make satisfactory arrangements for GDRS Cost
Recovetry (para 6.06); and
(b) appoint project consultants, financed initially under the ASAL
(paras 3.17 and 3.18).

TURKEY
DRAINAGE AND ON-FARM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Subsector Program
Topography, Soils, Climate, Population, Land Tenure, Agricultural Situation
and Agricultural Extension
A. Description of the Subsector Program
2.01     Location.  The program will be implemented in the irrigated schemes
where DSI has fully or substantially completed construction and where GDRS's
onfarm developments related to these irrigation works needs to be completed.
Irrigation has been developed particularly in the coastal zone of the
Mediterranean zone and Aegean regions and in the Central South region. The
subprojects to be financed under the loan would be selected from an agreed
list of 155 DSI's irrigation and drainage schemes, both completed and ongoing
(Annex 3, Table 2).
2.02     Topography and Soils.  In Turkey, mountains cover a great portion of
the land and only one-fifth of the country remains at altitude less than
500 m, mainly located in the coastal zones. Altitude and continentality are
the factors which determine most of the cropping and farming systems. Soils
are generally of moderate quality, which, when managed properly are able to
give higher yields. Alluvial soils dominate in the coastal regions. Large
areas of central Turkey have fine textured medium to shallow calcareous soils
of the reddish brown and brown soil groups. Soils of the Black Sea region are
of heavier texture; however, generally all soils are suitable for drainage
measures. The main constraints limiting the potential of the soils lie with
severe winter conditions leading to frost and slow plant growth, and
topography with related problems of soil and water conservation, and
water-logging in the irrigation schemes.
2.03     Climate - Temperature and Precipitation.  Turkey as a whole lies in
the temperate zone but its climate has considerable regional variations
depending on the altitude and the distance from the sea. The coastal areas
have a mild sea climate while inland severe continental conditions prevail.
Variations in temperature, slight on the coast, are considerable inland. The
south has a typical Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers; and mild
winters; the average annual temperature is 19-20°C, the average for July
being 28C and for January 8-11°C. The influence of the Mediterranean is
also felt on the shores of the Aegean and Marmara Sea, although average
temperatures fall from South to North. In the Inland zones (Central Anatolia)
summers are hot and dry and winter very cold with frequent snowfalls. The



-51-
ANNEX 2
Page 2
average annual temperatures is 10-120C. In Eastern Anatolia, summers are
cool and winters severe. South Eastern Anatolia is influenced by desert
climate with hot, dry summers and severe winters. Climatic characteristics of
the two zones are given in Annex 2, Attachment 1. Average annual rainfall is
the hignest in the Aegean provinces (Manisa: 746.7mm; Izmir: 700.2m;
Canakkale: 629.1mm; Balikesir: 609.2mm); but there are large variations
ranging Erolih 323.9nm at Konya to 746.7mm at Manisa. The number of raindays is
lowest at Ankara (69.8 days) and highest at Bursa with 200.9 days. Number of
frosty d,ys in the lowest coastal zone is 6.8 days at Izmir and highest in the
Inland rone of Konya with 100.1 days. Frosty days can begin as early as
August 2 in Kutahya and continue as late as May 31 in Eskisehir. Highest
temperatures is observed at Urfa with 40.5°C and the lowest temperatures at
Konya with 28.2C below zero.
2.04     Population and Land Tenure.  The program area is characterized by a
very large number of small farms averaging 2.2 ha in Coastal and 3.8 ha in
Inland regions. Farm units are not only small but they are also composed of
several parcels scattered in the schemes, about 2 plots per farm in the
Coastal region and 3 plots in the Inland region. The average plot size is
1.0 ha in the Coastal and 1.4 ha Inland. The following table summarizes the
farm distribution:

2.05     Land Use. About 562 of agricultural land represents the crop land in
Turkey, which is occupied by field crops (about 63X), fallow (about 24%) and
vineyards, orchards and vegetable gardens (about 13%). The dominant system of
cultivation in rainfed areas consists of a rotation including fallow 1 year
out of 2, especially for the interior regions. Fallow is of lesser importance
in coastal regions, which benefit from higher rainfall and are usually better
equipped with irrigation facilities. About 187 of the agricultural land is
irrigated.

2.06     Degree of Waterlogging.  The monitoring by DSI of the water table
level in 38 irrigation schemes over a period of 10 years (total net irrigated
area of 369,000 ha) has shown that during March/April 1983, an average of 35X
of the irrigation area has water table standing at 0-lm depth (Annex 2,
Table 2). In the coastal regions the average was 40% and in the inland
regions the average was 26%, on this basis, the area subject to water-logging
is estimated to be 440,000 ha, by 1989. The regression curves for nine
irrigation projects show that the water logged area is increasing at the rate
of about 3X annually, in the publicly managed irrigation systems.
B. Agricultural Situation in the Program Areas
2.07     Present Cropping Pattern.  The present agricultural situation in the
38 irrigation projects which have been monitored for water logging has been
examined for the years 1979-1983 separately for the coastal and inland areas.
In areas where irrigation has been introduced yields have remained below
potential mainly because of incomplete onfarm development works and
water-logging. It is estimated presently that only 70X of the irrigable land
is cultivated under irrigation and only 65X of that land is cultivated without
drainage constraint. Cropping patterns for the years 1979-83 are summarized
belaw.

2.08          Effects of Waterlogging on Cropped Areas and Yield.  The consequence
of the high water table situation is a reduction in the cultivated area, for
the land which is permanently water logged, estimated to represent 1S on
average of the irrigated land, and a net reduction of yield in the partially
or temporarily water-logged area (over 440,000 ha). The data collected by DSI
on crop yields, as well as observations made by the appraisal mission ir
different parts of Turkey and analysis of the published trial data, as
surmarixed below, confirm the adverse impact of water logging on yields.

The benefits arising from drainage works depend on factors like the timing,
length and severity of water-logging, type and value of crops and salinity
hazards.
C. Predominant Crops in the Program Area
2.09     Cereals.  Wheat is the main cereal grown in the program areas, in
rotation with sugar beet in the Inland region, and with cotton in the Coastal
region.  Yields are reasonably high and average 3.5 tons/ha.  Varieties are
generally of semi-dwarf high yielding type. Wheat cultivation is totally
mechanized. Rice is grown mainly in the Coastal region in totally or
partially water-logged zones. Yields range from 4 to 6 tons/ha level.
2.10     Cotton.  The Mediterranean, Aegean and Southern Anatolian regions are
the main cotton producing areas in Turkey. Yields range from 2.5 to 3 tons/ha
in non water-logged areas and are only 0.8 to 1.2 tons/ha in the waterlogged
areas and have been almost static in recent years. Picking is almost totally
by hand, with casual laborers coming from Eastern Turkey. Pests are a major
constraint in addition to water logging in depressing yields.



-55-
ANNEX 2
Page 6
2.11     Grain Legumes.  Lentils, broad beans, chick peas and dry beans are
the major pulses grown in the program area. Broad beans is a mechanized crop
from planting to harvesting, while for other pulses harvesting is done by hand
mainly because of the non-uniform maturities. These crops are grown by small
scale farmers using family labor, resulting in good quality cultivation and
relatively high yields, 3 tons/ha for broad beans and 1.8-2 tons/ha for
lentils, chick peaa and dry beans.
2.12     Fodder.  Alfalfa is the predominant fodder crop under irrigation.
The main variety is Fayseri of Turkish origin, but other improved varieties
from USA and Peru ewce increasing. Alfalfa is mainly grown in Inland regions
where it occupies about 6% of the land. It is harvested in winter up to 4 to
5 times when temperatures permit. In the irrigation schemes, animal
production is a marginal activity. Animals are kept by a limited number of
farmers only to meet family needs. There is no organized commercial livestock
activity for meat or milk production.
2.13     Tobacco.  Traditionally tobacco is grown under rainfed conditions
where quality is good but yields low and uncertain. In recent years, there
has been a shift towards producing tobacco under irrigation, particularly in
the Coastal region.
2.14     Sugar Beet.  This is a major industrial crop in Inland region, and is
grown in rotation with wheat and fodder. Yields are moderately high; 38
tons/ha on average. Sugar companies control production, through contracts
governing the area to be planted and provision of extension services, seed,
and certain inputs. Harvesting is organized in August/September to suit
factory needs. A premium is paid to farmers for early delivery. Sugarbeet
tops and a portion of the wet pulp is given back to farmers to be used as
animal feed.
D. Production Inputs. Research and Extension
2.15     Use of Production Inputs.  Past subsidization of fertilizer prices
encouraged its widespread use, and currently in many cases, farmers still are
using more fertilizer than needed. The use of agricultural chemicals
(herbicides, pesticides) has not spread as widely because of high prices and
limited farmer's know how. Presently uses of pesticides are consistent with
OPN 11.01. Disinfected seed produced by farmers, and certified seeds are
commonly in use.
2.16     Agricultural Research.  Research institutes have succeeded in
introducing a number of new varieties for several crops and promote
recommendations on cultural practices. However, in a number of cases these
recommendations have been too broad and not adapted to specific farming
systems. Research effectiveness also is constrained by weak linkages between
research, and extension and the farmers.

2.17     Agricultural Extension.  MAFRA's provincial Agricultural Extension
Service is represented in all the 67 provinces and 631 counties. Each
province is served by a Director of Agriculture who is responsible for
coordination of the various technical services within the province. Services
provided through section chiefs consist of animal health plant protection and
agricultural extension. Under a recent Bank project, Loan 2405-TU, services
akin to the T&V extension methods have been set up in 16 core provinces and
are expected to be extended throughout Turkey.

according to the following technical characteristics:
Wi)   the areas which can be drained and rehabilitated by cleaning and
digging to design levels those main and secondary drains which
require maintenance;
(ii)   areas where minimum additional investment is required in order
to drain the land, through provision of the drains and open farm
drains;
(iii)   areas with minimum additional investment as may require pumping
facilities to evacuate the drainage effluent;
(iv)   areas with extensive and moderate to severe secondary
salinization problems; and
(v)   areas requiring heavy investment cost, supporting high value
crops, such as citrus, cotton and vegetables.
3.       On this basis, it is expected that drainage works, both surface and
subsurface, as vell as access roads and land reclamation would take priority.
