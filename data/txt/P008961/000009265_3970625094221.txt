DRAINAGE AND ON-FARM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:       Republic of Turkey
Amount:         US$255 million equivalent
Terms:          Seventeen years including four years of grace, with interest
at the standard variable rate.
Proiect
Description:    The proposed project constitutes the first time slice of the
Government's program for completing or improving drainage and
on-farm development works for irrigation projects for which
major works have been completed or are close to completion.
It would include the following components:
(a)    rehabilitatioan of surface drains to restore them to their
planned performance;
(b)    excavation of additional drains to supplement the existing
drainage system;
(c)    installation of subsurface drainage network where appropriate;
(d)    installation of subsurface collector pipe drains to reinforce
existing subsurface drainage installations;
(e)    reclamation of selected tracts of saline land;
(f)    construction of access roads, minor buildings, field workshops
and other structures to facilitate operation and maintenance
of the system;
(g)    installation of piezometers and other devices to monitor
groundwater levels;
(h)    buildings and equipment for existing drainage and reciamation
research stations in the irrigated areas; and
i)    consulting services to assist GDRS and DSI in carrying out the
above program and overseas training of GDRS and DSI staff.
Benefits and Risks
The proposed project would support agreements reached under the
Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL, Loan 2585-TU) for
accelerating priority investments for drainage and on-farm
development. The proposed investments would eliminate waterlogging
and salinity, restore the existing irrigated areas to full
production, and prevent further deterioration of soils and reduction
in crop production. Approximately 97,000 farmers would benefit
initially, plus additional farmers operating land which without the
proposed investments would eventually become waterlogged. At full
development, annual on-farm employment would increase by about
7 million mandays, and fcreign exchange earnings/savings would amount
to about t177 million equivalent per year.

The main project risks concern the availability of adequate funding
and the capacity of the implementing agencies to prepare, appraise,
and select priority investments and coordinate overlapping
implementation plans and schedules. Measures are included to
minimize these risks. Provision of consultant services and training
programs are expected to improve the design and implementation
capacities of DSI and GDRS. To reduce the risk of funding
shortfalls, the Government would give the Bank an opportunity to
comment on the proposed budget allocations for the project prior to
finalization of the budget. However, if delays should occur due to a
shortfall in annual program funding or implementation capacity
constraints, selected program elements could be deferred and the
period for completing the program extended without jeopardizing
individual subproject benefits or subsector objectives.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY FOR A
DRAINAGE AND ON-FARM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of US$255 million to help finance
the foreign exchange cost of a Drainage and On-Farm Development Project. The
loan would have a term of 17 years including 4 years of grace, with interest
at the standard variable rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.       An economic mission visited Turkey in June 1982, and its report
entitled "Turkey: Country Economic Memorandum, Recent Economic Developments
and Medium-Term Prospects" (No. 4287-TU) was distributed to the Executive
Directors in June 1983. The report of a mission to review the financial
sector, entitled: "Turkey: Special Economic Report - Policies for the
Financial Sector" (No. 4459-TU), was distributed in September 1983. A Bank
mission reviewed the Government's Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1985-89)
in September 1984 and its report: "Turkey; The Vth Five Year Plan in the
Context of Structural Adjustment" (No. 5418-TU) was distributed in July 1985.
3.       Turkey's area is about 781,000 square kilometers (i.e. about equal to
the area of France and West Germany combined) with a population of around
50 million and GNP per capita of $1200 in 1984. The density of population is
low (78 per square kilometer of agricultural land), and about 47 percent live
in urban centers. Population growth (2.2 percent per annum) is below the
median for middle-income countries. Despite rapid economic growth in the
mid-1970s as well as emigration of workers (to Western Europe and more
recently, to the Middle East), there is still substantial unemployment which,
including disguised unemployment in agriculture, is estimated at about
19 percent of the civilian labor force. There is, however, little or no
absolute poverty, although income distribution is skewed. There are
considerable regional differences in income and large rural-urban
disparities. Recent data indicate a probable increase in income inequality
since the 1970s, especially a relative deterioration of the position of wage
and salary earners and an improvement in the position of the trading and
commercial classes, and, more generally, of capital-owners. Educational
enrollment has expanded greatly, but the level of adult literacy remains
relatively low compared to the European average for middle income countries.

Background
4.       During the 1970s Turkey did not make the necessary adjustments to the
shocks caused by the steep rise in oil prices, stagflation in the OECD
economies, and the consequent deterioration of its terms of external trade.
Until 1977 Turkey maintained high rates of economic growth by increasing
public investment. The foreign exchange requirements were financed initially
by workers' remittances and then increasingly by borrowing, a large part of it
short-term. The rapid GNP growth came to an abrupt halt in 1977 as the
massive external debt burden led to a sharp deterioration in creditworthiness,
severe shortages of imports, disruptions in industrial production and a rise
in unemployment. By the end of 1979, domestic inflation had also become an!
issue of critical importance.
5.       In response to the crisis of the late 1970s, the Turkish authorities
made a major shift in development strategy in 1980, moving towards outward
orientation and giving an increased role to market forces. To alleviate the
balance of payments constraint and import shortages, policies were adopted to
expand exports, increase workers' remittances, liberalize imports, encourage
foreign investment and improve external debt management. On the domestic
front, the objectives were a reduction in the inflation rate, reform of the
State Economic Enterprises (SEEs), a more efficient financial sector, improved
resource mobilization and better selection of investments, especially in the
public sector.
6.       The adjustment program, which has been supported by the Bank through
five structural adjustment loans and an agricultural sector adjustment loan,
involves far-reaching changes in attitudes, institutions, and the legal and
policy framework, all of which require time to be put in place. Major
structural changes have been made in the exchange rate system, the export and
import regimes, the tax system, interest rate and selective credit policies
and the public investment program. Implementation of the adjustment program
started in January 1980, continued under a military regime during the period
September 1980 - November 1983, and has since been carried out by an elected
government.
The Structural Adjustment Program - 1980-85
7.       The Turkish economy has shown an impressive response to the
structural adjustment program and actual outcomes met or exceeded the
Government's own targets through 1982. The overall performance deteriorated
in 1983 due to a combination of factors (slowdown of export growth, slippages
in the monetary program, shortfall in Government revenues), but improved
again, except in the area of inflation and the budget deficit, in 1984. The
improvement was maintained in 1985, as evidenced by a slowdown in inflation
and a reduction in the budget deficit.
8.       After expanding by 4.1 percent in 1981 and 4.6 percent in 1982, real
GNP growth slowed down to 3.2 percent in 1983, due to the effects of a bad
harvest, stagnant exports, and lower workers' remittances. The growth rate
rebounded in 1984 to 5.9 percent, mostly on account of favorable performance
in agriculture (3.7 percent growth) and industry (9.3 percent growth).



Exports also expanded strongly, by more than 25 percent in dollar terms. In
1985, according to the latest estimates, the growth rate of the economy was
about 4.9 percent, as against the program target of 5.5 percent. The slowdown
of growth is apparent across the board, but was most significant in
agriculture (2.2 percent growth) and manufacturing (5.5 percent), due
respectively to less favorable climatic conditions and slackening domestic
demand. On the expenditure side, the average annual real rate of growth of
public fixed investment over the period 1980-85 has been fairly stable, at
less than 3 percent p.a., while the growth rate of private investment has
recovered, following a 17.3 percent decline in 1980, and rose by 7.1 percent
in 1984 and an estimated 5.2 percent in 1985. Private consumption, after
declining by 5 percent in real terms in 1980, grew by 5 percent in 1983 and
1984 before slowing down to an estimated 3 percent in 1985. Strict budgetary
discipline contributed to a steady decline in the real rate of growth of
public consumption from 8.4 percent in 1980 to 1.8 percent in 1983; however,
it increased to 3.8 percent in 1984 and an estimated 4.4 percent in 1985.
9.       Through 1982, the Government met with considerable success in
reducing the rate of inflation by a combination of fiscal, monetary and
incomes policies. After peaking at 107 percent in 1980, the average annual
rate of increase in the wholesale price index decelerated to 37 percent in
1981 and 27 percent in 1982. In 1983 the downward trend was reversed and the
inflation rate rose to 30 percent. Inflation accelerated further in 1984, and
reached 50 percent. The major factors that brought about the worsening of the
inflationary situation in 1984 were the lagged impact of the expansionary
monetary policy pursued during the second half of 1983, and a significant
increase in agricultural product prices, especially of fresh fruits and
vegetables, as a consequence of export liberalization and higher export market
prices. Other contributory factors included substantial "catch up" increases
of SEE prices - since January 1984 most SEEs have effectively been allowed to
set their prices freely - and higher import prices resulting from the nominal
depreciation of the Turkish lira. In addition, inflationary pressures stemmed
from a larger than anticipated budget deficit in 1984 as a result of a
slowdown in the growth of revenues.
10.      Inflation declined to about 43 percent in 1985.  This average annual
inflation rate has been the net result of a period of high inflation during
the first quarter of the year, followed by a period of deceleration starting
in April 1985. Deceleration occurred despite significant increases in prices
of goods produced by SEEs; it was rendered possible by the maintenance of high
real rates of interest, a decline in the prices of a number of agricultural
goods (mostly fruits and vegetables), and an overall slackening of domestic
demand. The slowdown of inflation in the second half of 1985 reinforces the
expectations of a further decrease in the average rate in 1986, bringing it
close to the Government's target of 25 percent.
11.      In the fiscal- area, the progress achieved between 1980 and 1982
(during which time the budget deficit declined from 5.3 percent to 2.1 percent
of GNP) was not sustained in 1983 and 1984. Due to a steady decline in
consolidated government revenues as a percentage of GNP, 1/ the budget deficit
1/ Although total government revenues (inclusive of extra-budgetary funds
introduced in 1984) have not declined as sharply.



-4-
increased to 3.2 percent of GNP in 1983, and reached almost 5 percent of GNP
in 1984. The somewhat disappointing performance in the raising of revenues
was accompanied, however, by significant improvements in the control of public
expenditure. Overall, government expenditures decreased from 22 percent of
GNP in 1983 to an estimated 16 percent in 1985, essentially due to a
curtailment of personnel expenditures and government transfers to SEEs, with
the latter declining from 2.5 percent of GNP in 1983 to an estimated
0.8 percent of GNP in 1985. However, the fact that improvements in the area
of government expenditures were not matched by commensurate gains in the
reduction of the budget deficit highlights the urgency of mobilizing
additional public resources. As a step in this direction, the Government
introduced a Value Added Tax in January 1985, replacing previous indirect
taxes based on the value of output. The new tax has resulted in raising the
share of taxes on goods in total government revenues from around 12 percent in
1983-84 to an estimated 20 percent in 1985. As a result of these measures,
the budget deficit is expected to have improved to about 2.5 percent of GNP in
1985.
12.      Progress has also been made in rationalizing interest rates and
reforming the banking system.  Commercial bank deposit interest rates, which
were deregulated in July 1980, are positive in real terms. Time deposits have
been yielding a positive real return since early 1984, with interest rates
presently ranging between 45 and 55 percent depending upon the term of the
deposit. Positive deposit interest rates have resulted in a steady increase
in deposits: in 1984 private non-commercial deposits grew by 8 percent in
real terms, and in 1985 the growth has continued at a rate of about
10 percent. Improvements in incentives for savings were accompanied by
administrative reforms of the banking system. A new banking law was enacted
in June 1983. It included many of the recommendations made in the Bank's
report on the Financial Sector (No. 4459-TU), including measures to reduce the
undercapitalization of banks and the interlocking between banks and
corporations. The legal basis of the banking reform was strengthened with the
enactment of a revised banking law in April 1985, which introduced
standardized accounting for banks and specified improved procedures for
handling of non-performing loans. The Government also took a major step
towards reducing the cost of bank intermediation by reducing in December 1983
the financial transactions tax from 15 percent to 3 percent. Other important
developmencs in the financial sector include measures undertaken to revitalize
the capital markets, for which IFC has provided technical assistance, and the
sale of revenue-sharing certificates linked to the income from selected public
infrastructual facilities (e.g. the Bosphorus bridge, and two dams).
13.      While positive real interest rates have provided an incentive to
save, they have also meant high borrowing costs. Effective nominal interest
rates range from 60 to 80 percent on non-preferential credits, in part because
of the high intermediation costs of the commercial banks and the prevailing
practice of requiring compensating balances. The Government took a number of
steps in 1985 to reduce the interest rate differentials between preferential
and non-preferential credits: in particular, the preferential interest rate
for export credits was discontinued in January 1985, while interest rates for
agricultural short-term loans and for loans to SEEs were increased in 1985 to
30 percent (from 28 and 24 percent respectively). The narrowing of the gap
between interest rates on preferential and non-preferential credits, together



with the decrease in the amount of preferential credits, is expected to
increase the general availability of credit and exert a downward pressure on
non-preferential interest rates.
14.      Improvements in the balance of payments were substantial between 1980
and 1982, with the current account deficit decreasing from $3.3 billion
(5.7 percent of GNP) in 1980 to $1.2 billion (1.6 percent of GNP) in 1982. In
1983 the current account deficit increased to $1.8 billion, as merchandise
exports stagnated and workers' remittances fell by one-third. These
developments were reversed in 1984 as exports increased by over 25 percent in
dollar terms to reach $7.4 billion. Remittances, too, registered a higher
than expected increase, reaching $1.8 billion (up by 20 percent over 1983).
Merchandise imports, fueled by high growth as well as a more liberal import
regime put in place in 1984, grew by more than 16 percent to reach
$10.8 billion (or almost 22 percent of GliP). As a result of these
developments, both the trade and the current account deficits declined as
compared to 1983: the trade deficit by $50 million, and the current account
deficit by $350 million, to reach $1.4 billion or about 2.9 percent of GNP.
Estimates for 1985 indicate a further strong improvement of the current
account situation. Merchandise exports, after a sluggish start in 1985, grew
by 13 percent (in dollar terms) in the first ten months of 1985, while
merchandise imports grew at a moderate 6 percent. Among the invisibles,
tourism revenues and investment income from abroad have increased
significantly compared to 1984 and previous years. Similarly, workers'
remittances have continued to rise at a rate of about 6 percent per annum.
The current account deficit is now estimated in 1985 at $650-800 million
(about 1.7 - 1.9 percent of GNP).
15.      Merchandise export performance has been impressive throughout the
1980-85 period, during which exports registered an average annual rate of
increase of about 22 percent in dollar terms. This growth has been led by the
manufacturing sector and has involved a rise in the share of exports to the
Middle Eastern countries. Industrial exports, composed primarily of processed
foods and textiles, have risen from 36 percent of total exports in 1980 to
more than three-quarters in 1985. These results were achieved by a
combin ition of indirect (flexible exchange rate policy, import liberalization)
and direct (tax rebates, preferential credits) measures to enhance the
relative profitability of exports and offset the traditional bias towards
production for the domestic market. Successful penetration of the Middle
Eastern markets has brought their share in total Turkish exports from
17 percent in 1980 to around 40 percent in the 1983-85 period.
16.      On the import side, the 1982-83 period was marked by a relative
stability in the growth of merchandise imports, as prices of both oil and
non-oil imports declined, and the volume rate of growth remained moderate. In
1984, however, merchandise imports increased by 16.1 percent in dollar value.
The increase was most pronounced in some of the groups (e.g. raw materials and
consumer goods) that have been subjected to major liberalization in terms of
both a lowering of tariff rates and a significant removal of quantitative
restrictions. In 1985, as domestic demand eased, and the initial effects of
pent-up demand for importables released by import liberalization weakened, the
rate of import growth decreased to one-third of the level recorded in 1984.

Medium-Term Prospects
17.      The Fifth Five Year Development Plan (1985-89), which was approved by
the Grand National Assembly in June 1984, reaffirms the Government's
determination to pursue an outward-oriented development strategy and to
liberalize the economy by relying increasingly on market forces for allocation
decisions. The public sector is targeted to play a supportive role by
concentrating its investments in infrastructure rather than manufacturing,
while the private sector is to be encouraged to play a leading role in the
growth of manufacturing and exports. Some of the key targets are:
(i)    an average annual GNP growth rate of 6.3 percent;
(ii)    an average annual real rate of growth of merchandise exports of
10.6 percent;
(iii)    an average annual real rate of growth of 10.9 percent in private
investment and 6.8 percent in public investment;
(iv)    a declining external debt service ratio, from 26 percent in 1984
to around 18 percent in 1989; and
-v)    a decreasing rate of inflation reaching 10 percent p.a. in 1989.
18.      While the overall thrust of the Plan is in accord with the goals of
the structural adjustment program, the Plan targets, if viewed collectively
and in the light of the developments in 1984 and 1985, appear ambitious and
likely to strain domestic resources (especially in the public sector) as well
as to have an adverse impact on the external balance. Accordingly, the
Government is adjusting the annual programs to ensure that they remain
compatible with the fight against infiation and with a growth strategy
commensurate with the Government's ability to generate resources.
19.      The Bank's projections indicate that GDP growth of 5.7 percent p.a.
on average for the 1985-90 period may be more realistic.  In the first phase
of this period (1985-87), growth might be relatively slow (5.3 percent p.a.),
gradually accelerating in the outer years with an average rate of 6.0 percent
p.a. in the period 1988-90. The inflation targets in the Bank's projections
are also more conservative, implying a reduction from about 43 percent in 1985
to around 18 percent in 1990. Key economic variables in the Bank's
projections for the period 1985-90 are presented in Table 1: 1/
1/ The Bank's estimate for 1985 may differ slightly from the Government's
latest eLtimates for 1985 discussed above.

20.      Achievement of these growth rates will depend primarily on the
performance of agriculture and manufacturing. This in turn will depend to a
large extent on the Government's determination to constrain the growth of the
public sector in line with resources and to create a more favorable investment
climate for the private sector. This translates into a projected real growth
in public fixed investment of about 3.8 percent p.a. on average for the
1985-90 period, starting with a more modest increase of around 3.5 percent
p.a. in the early years. The comparable figure for the growth of private
fixed investment (for the whole period) is 10.0 percent p.a. These figures
are consistent with the need to meet the infrastructural requirements of the
economy through the public investment program, while providing for the
capacity expansion of the private sector necessary to meet the output and
export targets. The projections allow for a modest increase of per capita
consumption of about 3.0 percent p.a. on average over the period 1985-90.
21.      Merchandise exports are projected to grow at an average rate of
8.5 percent per annum in real terms during 1985-90, while merchandise imports
are projected to grow at an average annual rate of 7.8 percent. This is
consistent with the import liberalization program of the Government. On these
assumptions, the current account deficit is projected to decrease through 1988
as stabilization policies act to contain import growth while encouraging
exports. As higher grow-th rates set in during the outer years of the period,
the trend would reverse and the current account deficit would rise moderately
through 1990. For the year 1990, the projections show a deficit of
$310 million as compared to an estimated 1985 figure of $750 million. The
projected capital account would remain manageable throughout the period, even
in the face of some sharp increases in amortization payments arising from the
debts rescheduled during 1978-80.
272.     On the external front, the current expectation of lower oil prices in
the next period is likely to have a positive impact on the balance of
payments. The savings on direct petroleum imports could be as much as
$275 million in 1986 alone. Lower oil prices will no doubt have some negative
consequences for Turkey's exports to oil-exporting countries as well as on
profit and workers' remittances from construction activities in these
countries. Nevertheless, the overall effect on the current account is likely
to be positive, due to the stronger effect of the import savings.
23.      The meditum-term scenario presented above is, of course, only one of
many possibilities and is used specifically to illustrate Turkey's potential
in the light of the Government's own development strategy. Given Turkey's
progress in the structural adjustment program, the favorable response which
this has evoked from the international financial community, and the present
outlook for both lower oil prices and a strong growth of Turkish exports, the
GNP growth projected in the mediumrterm base case scenario could be exceeded
if slightly higher export growth rates were achieved and there was an
improvement in the mobilization of public resources.
24.      In view of the sensitivity of the projections to the assumptions
regarding export growth, a downside risk case has also been developed. With
Turkey's export performance heavily dependent on exogenous factors such as the
world economic conditions and movements in international prices, a slower



-9-
growth of merchandise exports (an average of about 6 percent p.a. over the
1985-90 period) coupled with lower mobilization of public resources
(3 percent lower revenues than envisaged under the base case scenario) would
lead to a more difficult but still manageable balance of payments situation, a
lower GDP growth (averaging about 4.7 percent p.a.) and a higher debt service
ratio (averaging 26.7 percent during 1986-90 against 25.1 percent in the base
case scenario). In such a situation the Government would have less chance of
absorbing the unemployed and improving tangibly the average standard of
living. However, if the Government in such circumstances were to resort to a
high growth strategy, then it could witness a repeat of the situation which
prevailed in the 1970s, and which led to a debt crisis. It is unlikely that
the Gavernment would risk such a situation. It is therefore more probable -
even if exogeneous developments are unfavorable - that the Government will
continue with the structural adjustment program as implemented to date, so
that the scenario of high growth fuelled by increased external borrowing seems
at present unlikely.
External Debt and Creditworthiness
25.      At the end of 1978, Turkey had $7.2 billion in short-term debt and
$7.0 billion in medium and long-term debt. Between 1978 and 1980, Turkey
rescheduled some $9.2 billion of outstanding obligations through a series of
rescheduling arrangements concluded with official and commercial creditors.
Following the resolution of the debt crisis, inflows were mostly from official
sources - OECD countries, the World Bank and the IMF. Since 1983 commitments
from commercial banks have outstripped those from official sources and have
reached an estimated level of $2.5 billion by end-1985. Of the estimated
total debt outstanding of $22.3 billion (including IMF) at end-1984, medium
and long-term debt accounted for about 79 percent. Short-term debt as a
percentage of total debt outstanding fell from 51 percent in 1978 to about
11 percent in 1982, then increased to 14 percent in 1983 and to an estimated
21 percent in 1984. Much of this growth in the stock of short-term debt is
due to the inflows associated with the Dresdner Bank scheme 1/. At end-1984,
the outstanding liabilities associated with the Dresdner scheme amounted to
$1.8 billion, constituting 39 percent of short-term external obligations.
Based on the growth scenario outlined in paras. 19 to 22, debt outstanding and
disbursed as a percentage of GDP is projected to fall from an estimated
42 percent in 1984 to 37 percent in 1990. This translates into a total debt
outstanding forecast for 1990 of $28.8 billion, with short-term debt
constituting about 25 percent of the total.
26.      The debt service ratio for medium and long-term credits increased
from about 26 percent in 1984 to an estimated 31 percent in 1985, mostly as a
result of large repayments of rescheduled debt falling due. Debt service
obligations are expected to be on average about $4.0 billion a year during
1/ Under this scheme the Dresdner Bank collects deposits from Turkish workers
in West Germany and automatically places these funds at the disposition of
tue Central Bank of Turkey, which guarantees the deposits and pays an
interest rate commensurate with the Euro-market rate.



- 10 -
1986-90, a quarter of which is attributable to service obligations on
rescheduled debt. However, the debt service ratio is projected to decrease to
a level of about 25 percent during 1986-1990, due largely to improvements in
the current account of the balance of payments. The debt burden should remain
manageable provided current policies are successfully implemented, the export
drive is sustained, and Turkey continues to receive support from international
commercial and official sources. Confidence in Turkey's overall economic
performance, its stable record in meeting debt servicing obligations and its
improved debt management, encouraged commercial banks to commit about
$1.8 billion in 1985. Several major American, European, Japanese and Middle
Eastern banks were involved in these operations, including a $500 million
syndicated loan in support of the balance of payments signed in April 1985.
27.      Turkey's economic program has been supported by the INF through a
series of standby arrangements during 1980-84. The Government did not ask for
a new standby in 1985. The Government's decision seems to reflect the view
that the favorable economic developments in 1985 constitute proof of Turkey
having "graduated" from the IMF's program and that the INF presence through
Article IV consultations should suffice for purposes of maintaining
international confidence.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
28.      Through September 30, 1985 the Bank and IDA have lent
$tb185.8 million 1/ to Turkey, through 88 projects. Agriculture accounts for
21 percent of the funds lent, industry and DF(s for 22 percent, power for
16 percent, structural adjustment and program loans for 27 percent, and urban
development, transportation, education, tourism and technical assistance for
the remaining 14 percent. Disbursements for all sectors combined averaged
b3 percent of appraisal estimates at the end of September 1985, which compares
favorably with other countries in the region. As of September 30, 1985, IFC
commitments to Turkey totalled about $246 million, of which about $64 million
were still held by IFC. Annex II provides a summary statement of Bank loans,
IDA credits and IFC investments as of September 30, 1985.
29.      Bank lending is aimed at supporting Turkey's medium-term objectives
of restructuring the Turkish economy by placing more reliance on market forces
and adopting a more outward-oriented strategy. The main vehicle for the
Bank's operational discussions with the Government has been the structiral
adjustment lending (SAL) program, which was completed in June 1984, and more
recently the sectoral adjustment lending program. Significant progress has
been achieved in the last five years, but the task of restructuring is by no
means over. The current plan involves the broadening and deepening oL the
adjustment process at the sectoral level. Recent economic developments have
underlined the need for a continuation of the stabilization program without
1/   Net of cancellations.



- 11 -
giving up the goals of sectoral adjustment. Hence the emphasis of Bank
lending in the post-SAL period would be on striking an appropriate balance
between sectoral adjustment lending designed in part to be quick disbursing
and supportive of policy reforms in the major sectors, and carefully
formulated project le-ding focussing on high priority projects principally in
the agriculture, energy, industry and transport sectors.
30.     A series of sectoral adjustment loans for the major sectors is
planned over the next few years. A first loan for agriculture was approved in
June 1985. Further lending of this kind would support measures to address the
structural problems of the financial sector and enhance the utilization of
industrial capacity in the public and private sectors, keeping in view the
scope for the "privatization" of publicly-held assets in the manufacturing
subsectors. Other sectors where sectoral adjustment loans are likely to be
developed include energy and transport, and it is expected that there would bf:
a follow-up loan in agriculture.
31.      This would be the fifth loan to Turkey presented to the Executive
Directors this fiscal year. Other projects being processed include a second
railway project, the Sir hydropower project, and a financial sector adjustment
loan.
32.      The close macroeconomic and sector dialogue established with the
Government in recent years is expected to be pursued. The economic and sector
work currently being undertaken includes a review of the public investment
program ard studies of housing finance, engineering industries, transport
investment and electronics. Topics expected to be covered in the future
include a study in domestic resource mobilization, a country economic
memorandum focussing on inflation, reviews of the health and education sectors
and a study of private sector adjustment to liberalization action.
33.      Turkey's debt burden is projected to remain manageable throughout
1986-89 (paras. 25 and 26). The Bank Group's share of Turkey's total external
debt was 13.4 percent in 1983, is estimated at 14 percent in 1984, and is
expected to grow to about 17 percent by 1989. Official debt outstanding is
projected to increase from $11.0 billion in 1984 to $13.4 billion in 1989 and
private medium and long-term debt outstanding is projected to increase from
$5.2 billion in 1984 to $7.5 billion in 1989. The Bank group's share of total
debt service payments is projected to increase from about 12 percent in 1983
to an estimated 13 percent in 1984, and to about 18 percent in 1989.
34.      IFC has invested in synthetic yarns, textiles, pulp and paper, glass,
aluminum, cement, iron and steel products, heavy diesel engines, motor bicycle
engines, piston rings, food processing and tourism. It has also invested in
the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) and provided guarantees for
overseas contracting firms. In addition, IFC is currently providing technical
assistance to the Government with respect to the development of the capital
market and a regulatory framework for leasing.

PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
35.      While the relative importance of the agricultural sector in the
economy is declining, it still represents in a typical year about 18 percent
of GDP, about a third of export earnings and about half of civilian
employment. The growth rates of agricultural GDP and exports are projected to
remain below those for the rest of the economy. Nevertheless, the
agricultural sector will continue to play a significant role in meeting
domestic food needs, supplying industrial raw materials, and providing foreign
exchange earnings and employment.
36.      Turkish agriculture is diverse.  Intensive crop cultivation is
prevalent in the coastal regions which receive plentiful rainfall or are
equipped with irrigation facilities. Mixed (crop and livestock) farming
predominates in the eastern and central parts of the country where pastures
and meadows form more than half of the agricultural land and crop production
is dependent upon rainfall.  In these areas much of the land is kept fallow in
alternating years.  While the livestock production system is largely
traditional, dependent on grazing lands and low productivity systems of animal
husbandry, it produces about one-third of agricultural GDP.  Cereal crops
occupy about 66 percent of the cultivated area, fruits and vegetables about
20 percent, industrial crops about six percent, and oil seeds, pulses and
tubers the remaining seven percent.
37.      Through the 1970s, Turkey's agricultural policies were inward-
looking, stressing food self-sufficiency through subsidized inputs and
producer prices. This led to relatively rapid growth of production through
the first half of the 1970s, averaging 4.7 percent from 1972-75. However,
with a deteriorating overall macroeconomic situation, these growth rates could
not be maintained, due in part to the strain placed upon the budget by the
level of subsidization and the competing demand for resources from the
manufacturing sector. As a result of the overall economic crisis, growth in
the sector slowed to less than 1.5 percent per annum during the late 1970's.
Ineffective public investment policies, weaknesses in technical services, and
problems in marketing and credit also contributed to sluggish growth. During
this period, sectoral exports remained a small fraction of total production
(less than 1 percent of agricultural GDP in 1979) due to the overvalued
exchange rate and other disincentives to export.
38.      New Policies:  As part of the structural adjustment program adopted
by the Government in 1980, input subsidies and production price supports were
reduced and market-oriented policies were introduced. The overall restraint
on monetary policy forced a curtailment of agricultural credit. Exports were
encouraged through the introduction of a competitive exchange rate policy and
other incentives. Unavoidably, this shift in strategy produced some
short-term shocks to sectoral development: the growth of agricultural GDP in



- 13 -
real terms fell to an average of only 0.9 percent in 1980 and 1981. 1/ In
1982 and 1983, 1/ however, real growth in agricultural GDP recovered to an
average annual rate of 3.1 percent. During 1984 it reached 3.7 percent. Due
to the adoption of a realistic exchange rate and relaxation of export
licensing restrictions, agricultural exports increased by an annual average
rate of 17.7 percent during 1980 and 1981. If agroindustrie.' exports are
included, the average annual rate of growth increases to 18.9 percent. In
1982 and 1983, while agricultural exports continued to grow in volume, the
average annual rate of growth of the value of agricultural exports dropped
sharply to only 1.2 percent, due to the decline in the prices of the main
commodities. H{owever, for agriculture and agroindustries combined, the
average annual rate of export growth remained at a healthy 9.5 percent,
indicating a significant switch from unprocessed to processed exports. During
1985 the estimated agricultural growth rate declined to 2.3 percent, and
agricultural exports through September decreased by about 7 percent as
compared to the same period in 1984, reflecting the effects of an unusually
severe drought.
39.      Prospects:  The potential for Turkey's agricultural sector over the
medium term was examined in a recent agricultural sector study 2/. The report
stated that the possibilities for growth through expansion of the cropped area
or of livestock numbers under a system of extensive grazing, were largely
exhausted by the mid-1970s. Growth must now come primarily from increased
productivity and changing the crop mixture to reflect better Turkey's
comparative advantage. Increased productivity wouLd require expansion in the
irrigated area through improved efficiency of the implementing agencies
(better planning, increased use of contractors), better extension and research
programs, expanded imports of improved seeds and appropriate equipment, and
increased availability of institutional credit, particularly for small and
mediun-scale farmers.
40.      The demands of an export-oriented approach have led to a change of
emphasis in Government policy from food self-sufficiency to increased net
agricultural contribution to the balance of trade. Thus imports of certain
foods in which Turkey does not have a comparative advantage have been
permitted. Increasing agricultural exports has involved appropriate pricing
signals, maintenance of a competitive exchange rate, reduction of export
regulations, and improved marketing. Other important issues in the sector
include improved sectoral planning, continued progress in the reduction of
subsidies, and reform of agricultural SEEs and marketing agencies. In
parallel, general economic stabilization must continue to provide a foundation
for uninterrupted sectoral growth. With continued progress on these issues
and adherence to policies designed to encourage exports, agricultural GDP is
expected to achieve a growth rate of about 3.0 percent annually during the
remainder of the 1980s, with agricultural exports (excluding agroindustries)
growing at 5-8 percent annually.
1/    In each case, one year of above average and one of below average weather
has been averaged to produce an approximation of normal performance.
Thus the difference between 1980/81 and 1982/83 is real and not weather
related.

(Report No.4204-TU), dated June 30, 1983.



- 14 -
The Irrigation Subsector
41.      Irrigation investment represents about 65 percent of the public
sector agricultural investment program and has been a major factor in
increasing and stabilizing agricultural production. While about 18 percent of
arable land is irrigated, roughly 40 percent of all plant output and about
25 percent of agricultural exports are grown under irrigation. In many
respects, however, irrigated agriculture has performed considerably below its
potential. Newly developed irrigation projects have often failed to produce
expected benefits due to (i) lack of adequate drainage works leading to
waterlogging and salinity; (ii) lack of adequate extension services and
cropping systems research; (iii) delays in completing on-farm development
works which are required for optimum utilization of the water supplied; and
(iv) inadequate maintenance of some completed works. The increase in
irrigated crop areas has therefore lagged significantly behind the expansion
of irrigation infrastructure. The underutilization of this infrastructure,
built at comparatively high cost, results in a large loss to the economy.
42.      The irrigated area varies considerably from year to year, since wheat
is not usually irrigated in years of adequate rainfall. The maximum area
under irrigation in recent years is estimated at about 4.7 mill:on hectares
(out of 28 million ha of arable land) and much of this area is inadequately
operated with low water efficiency and less than optimal yields. The
Government has estimated, based on technical criteria only, that an additional
4.0 million ha could be irrigated. However, it is likely that only a smaller
area could be developed economically. The highest potential for increasing
irrigated production in the near future lies in (i) concentrating resources on
completing projects near to completion; (ii) providing drainage and on-farm
works in areas where major irrigation facilities have been completed;
(iii) improving the maintenance of completed works; and (iv) developing
effective extension services to introduce appropriate irrigation techniques to
first time users and to farmers currently using inappropriate methods and
cropping patterns.
43.      Two public agencies are responsible for the construction of
irrigation facilities. The General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (DSI)
of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources is responsible for the
construction of the basic irrigation infrastructure for large-scale projects.
The General Directorate of Rural Services (GDRS) of the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Affairs (MAFRA) is responsible for the
construction of on-farm development works on large-scale irrigation projects
and the development of small-scale projects. These agencies have not been
able to contribute fully to agricultural productivity increases because of the
thin spread of scarce budget resources over too many projects, excessive
reliance upon force account work, inadequate coordination between the two
agencies in project design and implementation, and poor supporting services,
resulting in slow project completion and limited agricultural benefits.



- 15 -
44.      Irrigation investment levels have been growing gradually at about
4 percent per year in real terrms since 1981. The DSI investment program has
averaged about twice that of GDRS. Since 1980, when DSI resources were spread
thinly over 142 projects, considerable progress has been made in concentrating
resources on a smaller number of projects. As a result, the new irrigation
area put into operation each year by DSI has increased from 18,000 ha in 1981
to 86,000 ha in 1984. However, GDRS has recently been able to complete only
10-12,000 ha per year of the key components of on-farm development, namely
farm drains and subsurface drains. The estimated backlog of subsurface
drainage on completed DSI schemes would exceed 300,000 ha by 1989. This
increasing backlog between irrigation infrastructure development by DSI and
the completion of GDRS' on-farm development works suggests the need to revise
the allocation of public resources for irrigation investment.
45.      The problems referred to above are recognized by the Government,
which has agreed to carry out an Irrigation Development Study and formulate a
10-year Irrigation Development Master Plan (1986-1995) using funds made
available under the IAEE Irrigation Project (Loan 2433-TU, approved in
June 1984). The Master Plan would be based on a detailed project-by-project
inventory and an assessment of existing and projected irrigation and on-farm
development investments and financial and implementation constraints. It
would detail the issues and targets to be reached, including additional works
required, cost and timing, arrangements for improving the sustainability of
irrigation works and better cost recovery. To facilitate coordination, the
Government has indicated that it intends to use the consulting firm to be
selected under this project to provide assistance (financed under Loan
2433-TU) for preparation of the Master Plan. In parallel, and with financing
from the Bank-assisted Agricultural Extension and Applied Research Project
(Loan 2405-TU, approved in April 1984), the Government is also implementing a
program to improve agricultural extension, with priority for irrigated areas.
46.      Significant progress has been made in implementing agreements reached
under the TlAF Irrigation Project (Loan 2433-TU) for overcoming problems in
irrigation cost recovery. Under the IAEE Project the Government agreed to
(i) adjust DSI capital recovery charges under existing legislation to include
interest; (ii) progressively increase DSI assessments for operation and
maintenance (06M) to achieve 100 percent recovery of the preceding year's cost
by 1986; and (iii) increase penalties for overdue payments. It was further
agreed that action would be taken to permit GDRS to recover its capital costs
for on-farm works. DSI's O&M assessments have been increased by 254 percent
in real terms in 1984 over 1978 levels. These assessments were increased
further in 1985 to cover 75 percent of the prior year's costs, and are
scheduled to reach 100 percent this year. In 1983, the Government increased
the penalties for late payment so that if payment is late by one year, a total
penalty is levied equal to 54 percent of the initial assessment as compared to
10 percent previously. This penalty was increased to 75 percent in 1985. The
Government has also enacted legislation in accordance with the IAEE agreement
permitting GDRS for the first time to collect water charges to recover costs
on its irrigation investments. Draft regulations for implementation of this
legislation have been prepared and are being reviewed by the concerned
ministries. The Government has agreed to colLect adequate water charges on



- 16 -
both DSI and GDRS works in the area served by this loan, in accordance with
the same criteria agreed for the IAEE Project, namely full recovery of DSI O&M
expenditure for the prior year, recovery of DSI capital costa over a period
not to exceed 50 years, and recovery of GDRS costs over 20 years. Since most
maintenance of GDRS works is carried out by the farmers concerned, no O&M
charge is considered necessary for such works. Arrangements satisfactory to
the Bank for carrying out GDRS cost recovery obligations (expected to be
established through Government approval of the regulations referred to above)
would be a condition of loan effectivensss.
Public Investment Rationalization
47.      In a period of constrained public resources, it is important for
Turkey to concentrate on projects which can be brought into production quickly
and for which the incremental investment in completion would result in high
economic returns. This policy is particularly appropriate for irrigation
investment. In connection with the recently approved Agriculture Sector
Adjustment Loan (ASAL) 1/, a Core Program of drainage and on-farm development
investments was agreed, designed to bring about adequate drainage in the
command area of DSI's ongoing and completed projects, the completion of
highest priority on-farm works, and the provision of adequate O&M to insure
the optimum utilization of the command area. The Government agreed to
complete this Core Program and indicated its intention to increase the share
of its investment allocations for this type of investment. Specific works to
be completed under this program would be selected in accordance with criteria
agreed with the Bank. The Government indicated its intent to maintain funding
levels beginning in 1986 to permit GDRS to complete 100,000 ha/year of on-farm
works. 2/ This would also be facilitated by increased reliance on contract
construction work.  In order to supplement current staff capacity for
implementing this program, the ASAL provides funds to finance engineering
consultants for a period of about two years to assist in operational
programming, scheduling and design of approved works in the Core Program, and
in monitoring their implementation. In view of the complexity of the task,
the ASAL also finances independent internationally recruited consultants to
review the economic, agricultural, and engineering work of the consulting
engineering firms. To assist DSI in implementing its portion of the Core
Program (rehabilitation and maintenance of surface drains over an area of
about 1.3 million ha, and subsequent continuation of maintenance through
improved O&M), the ASAL also finances the imported machinery and equipment
needed for the rehabilitation and maintenance of surface drains. The draft
consultants' terms of reference and equipment tender documents have been
reviewed with the Bank and are being revised to incorporate Bank comments.
Employment of the consultants would be a condition of effectiveness of this
loan.
1/   Loan 2545-TU, approved in June 1985.
2/   The 100,000 ha/year target includes some land-leveling and other on-farm
works which are not part of the Core Program.



- 17 -
48.      Although the Government intends to place increased emphasis in its
investment program on completing on-farm works, the construction of headworks
for selected priority investments would continue. Under the indicative
investment program reviewed by the Bank, it is expected that DSI would be able
to complete irrigation infrastructure for about 475,000 ha during the next
five to six years. Under the ASAL, the Government agreed to review during
1986, with the help of consultants, all ongoing DSI projects in accordance
with the current criteria for screening new projects, based upon economic and
technical viability. The findings of this review will be furnished to the
Bank, to be followed by an exchange of views on the proposed 1987 irrigation
investment and recurrent expenditure program.
Performance under Previous Irrigation Projects
49.      The Bank and IDA have provided financing for six irrigation projects
in Turkey through loans and credits totalling about $274 million. Some of
these projects also included power components. All but one (the IAEE
Irrigation Project, approved in June 1984) have been completed. Aside from
components under rural development projects, no irrigation lending took place
between 1973 and 1984 due to the lack of an agreement on adequate measures
regarding cost recovery. The most recently completed Project Performance
Audit Reports (PPARs) on two irrigation projects found them to have been
generally successful and to have yielded high economic benefits. But, in
addition to the issue of cost recovery, the PPARs noted inadequate provision
of extension services, initial delays in establishing project implementing
units and periodic delays in providing adequate local cost financing. The
proposed loan has been designed to take full account of these findings. In
the areas served by the Ceyhan-Aslantas project (Loan 883-TU/Credit 360-TU,
FY 1973) and the Corum-Cankiri Rural Development Project (Loan 1130-TU, FY
1975) the extension service is performing well using an improved approach
pioneered under several Bank-assisted projects. The Government has recognized
the need to reorganize and strengthen its extension activities and is
developing programs for introducing the new extension system on a nationwide
basis. Loan 2405-TU (Agricultural Extension and Applied Research Project),
approved in 1984, assists in financing a first phase program to introduce
improved extension and research methods in 16 of Turkey's 67 provinces. A
second extension and research project is currently under preparation. Since
the proposed Drainage and On-Farm Development Project would finance completion
or improvement of services for on-going irrigation programs, most of the major
implementat;on units required already exist. Arrangements are proposed for
Bank revieh of proposed project budget provisions (para. 55), which would
provide an early warning system and help to provide adequate financial support
for the project.
PART IV - TkiE PROJECT
History
50.      In connection with the preparation of the ASAL, a Core Program of
high priority investments was identified to increase yields in the command
areas of DSI projects for which the headworks have been completed or are close



- 18 -
to completion (para. 47). The proposed loan would assist in financing the
first time slice of this Core Program. The outline of the Core Program and
the preliminary engineering and agricultural/economic preparation was carried
out by DSI and GDRS staff, with assistance from Bank staff and the FAO/World
Bank Cooperative Program. The project was appraised in May/June 1985. A
Staff Appraisal Report entitled "Turkey - Drainage and On-Farm Development
Project" (No. 5869-TU, dated February 6, 1986) is being distributed separately
to the Executive Directors. The key features of the proposed project are
listed in the Loan and Project Summary and in Annex III. Negotiations took
place in Washington in January 1986, with a delegation headed by Mr. Hikmet
Ulugbay, Chief Counselor for Economic and Commercial Affairs of the Turkish
Embassy in Washington, and including representatives of the Treasury, DSI,
GDRS, and the State Planning Organization.
Project Objectives and Features
51.      The proposed project would support the strategy agreed under the Core
Program which involves placing priority on investments designed to improve the
productivity of subprojects for which DSI headworks and irrigation systems are
completed or close to completion. Waterlogging and salinity due to inadequate
drainage has been identified as a major factor limiting production in
irrigated areas, reducing yields by a minimum of 25 percent from those
observed in similar areas having adequate drainage. These estimates do not
take into account the progressive additional areas which would be affected by
waterlogging without remedial measures. The Core Program involves investments
to vi) overcome the backlog of on-farm drainage works (para. 44);
(ii) rehabilitate existing surface drains, construct new drains where
required, and improve maintenance of major drainage works; (iii) recLaim land
suffering from salinity due to inadequate drainage; and (iv) provide access
roads required for maintenance of the irrigation and drainage systems.
52.      The estimated total cost of the Care Program, including physical and
price contingencies, is about $1.2 billion. This includes about $117 million
for DSI drainage maintenance equipment and technical assistance and training
financed under the ASAL. A time slice within the Core Program has been
identified consisting of works expected to be initiated during the next three
years and to be completed by December 31, 1991. The proposed project would
finance this time slice consisting of rehabilitation and construction of new
drains over about 668,000 ha, subsurface drainage over about 137,500 ha, and
other related works as swmnarized below:
(i)   Rehabilitation of existing surface drainage systems where
drains are choked with silt deposits and weed growth
(resulting primarily from lack of appropriate maintenance
equipment);
(ii)   Installation of additional surface drains in areas where the
initial intensity of surface drains has proven to be
inadequate to prevent salinity and waterlogging;



- 19 -
(iii)   Installation of subsurface drainage facilities to drain clay
soils which cannot be adequately served by surface drains;
(iv)   Installation of additional subsurface collector drains in
existing areas served by subsurface drains;
(v)   Reclamation of land damaged by salinity due to previous
inadequate drainage;
(vi)   Construction of feeder roads to provide adequate access for
maintenance and to otherwise connect with the public road
system, and of minor field offices, stores, workshop
facilities and other buildings needed for the operation and
maintenance of the system;
(vii)   Installation of piezometers and other groundwater level
monitoring devices;
(viii)   Provision of buildings and equipment for two drainage
research stations; and
(ix)   Technical assistance and staff training programs.
Items (i) and (ii) above would be implemented by DSI, (iii)-(viii) by GDRS,
and (ix) by both. It is anticipated that the remainder of the Core Program
(consisting of works to be initiated from mid-1989 to 1991 and completed by
about 1993) would be considered for financing under a second Bank loan.
53.      The Government's program for the first year, which consists only of
rehabilitation of surface drains, would be selected from an overall program
for surface drainage rehabilitation which has been reviewed (on a sample
basis) by the Bank and is considered appropriate. All design work for this
program for rehabilitation of surface drains has been completed. The specific
list of subprojects selected to be carried out during the first year of the
project would be submitted to the Bank for approval in early 1986. Criteria
have also been agreed for the selection of subprojects for inclusion in
subsequent years' programs. Prior to initiating procurement for the second
year's program, and annually thereafter, the subprojects to be included would
be selected by the Government in accordance with the agreed criteria and,
together with designs prepared with the assistance of the consultants financed
under the ASAL (para. 47), submitted to the Bank for approval. Since the ASAL
financing of these consultants is expected to be completed in about two years,
the proposed Drainage and On-Farm Development Loan includes funds for
continuing the service of these consultants, who would be retained until the
end of the implementation period.
Riparian Rights
54.      It has been agreed that the subprojects to be financed under the loan
would be selected from an agreed list of 155 completed or on-going DSI
irrigation and drainage schemes. None of these 155 schemes is located on an
international river and therefore no riparian rights issues are involved.



- 20 -
Cost Estimates and Financing
55.      The estimated total cost of first time slice of the Core Program to
be financed under the proposed loan is about $480.5 million, excluding about
$23 million of taxes and duties and the drainage maintenance equipment,
technical assistance and training financed under ASAL. The foreign exchange
component, both direct and indirect, is estimated at about $255 million or
53 percent of the total cost. Physical contingencies at 15 percent of the
base cost have beer. included for civil works. Price contingencies in dollar
terms have been compounded annually for the years 1986 to 1991 at 7, 7, 7.5,
7.7, 7.6 and 4.5 percent respectively, for both local and foreign costs.
(While local costs in TL are expected to increase at a faster rate, it is
assumed that the Government will maintain current exchange rate policies which
compensate for differences between local and foreign inflation.) The proposed
Bank loan of $255 million would finance the equivalent of the estimated
foreign exchange cost of the project. The remaining costs would be financed
by the Government. The Bank has reviewed the allocations for the various
project components included in the 1986 budget and found them to be adequate.
For later years the Government would, by September 30 each year, provide to
the Bank for comment an annual updated financing plan giving the proposed
budget allocations for the project, and updated project schedules and cost
estimates.
Contracting and Procurement
56.      The rapid increase envisaged in GDRS' implementation capacity for
drainage and on-farm development works is expected to be achieved through the
use of contractors for types of work previously carried out primarily by force
account. About $307 million of such works would be implemented by contractors
employed through international competitive bidding (ICB). Subprojects (other
than about $2 million for buildings for the research stations and construction
of minor buildings for operation and maintenance of the drainage systems)
would be regionally combined to form groups sufficiently large to attract
international bidders, with a minimum contract size of $15 million
equivalent. For drainage works, contracts need to be large enough to justify
the contractor's purchases of equipment. Subcontracting would be allowed.
Land leveling (for which small locally tendered contracts would be
appropriate) would not be financed under this loan. DSI rehabilitation of
surface drains (estimated to cost about $122 million) would be carried out by
force account, using equipment procured through ICB and financed under the
ASAL. These works are spread throughout Turkey, and are too small to be of
interest to international contractors. After rehabilitation, the same
equipment would be used for periodic maintenance of the drains. The
rehabilitation work would be carried out by existing DSI staff employed by its
25 regional directorates. DSI is considered fully competent to carry out
these activities in an efficient manner. DSI force account would also be used
for about $0.8 million of expenditure for the installation of groundwater
monitoring devices. DSI has already installed such equipment in 38 existing
schemes and the arrangements for this ongoing program are considered
appropriate. Consultants' services (about $7.6 million equivalent) would be
provided by firms recruited in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.



- 21 -
Equipment for the research stations and for monitoring groundwater (about
$0.20 million) would be procured after soliciting at least three price
quotations.

Note:    Figures in brackets are the amounts to be financed by the Bank.
Disbursement and Audit
57.      The Bank loan would be disbursed against (i) 57 percent of the costs
of GDRS civil works; (ii) 45 percent of the costs of DSI civil works;
(iii) 100 percent of expenditures for consultants' services; (iv) 100 percent
of expenditures for overseas training; and (v) 100 percent of foreign
expenditure and local expenditure ex-factory for equipment and for library
materials for the research stations. Disbursements would be made against full
documentation, except for reimbursements for DSI force account work and
contracts below $10,000 for equipment and below $20,000 for civil works, for
which statements of expenditure would be used. A revolving fund Special
Account woulu be established in the Central Bank of Turkey, to which the Bank
would make an initial deposit of $20 million, so as to avoid the need for the
Government to prefinance contracts and then await Bank reimbursement. The
loan is expected to be disbursed within about seven years. This corresponds
to about 95 percent of the disbursements under the standard agriculture sector
profile for Turkey.
58.      DSI and GDRS would each maintain separate accounts for the project.
Staff of the two agencies would prepare at the end of each quarter a detailed
statement of project expenditures during the period and submit each statement
to the Bank within 45 days after the end of each quarter. Such statements
would, inter alia, be used as the basis for Bank review of progress and



- 22 -
supervision of costs of DSI force account works. An annual audit would be
carried out by auditors of the Undersecretariat for Treasury and Foreign Trade
and submitted to the Bank within nine months of the end of each fiscal year.
Other Project Features
59.      The Government would implement an agreed extension systen in the
areas served by the project, upon completion of the irrigation works for each
subproject area. This extension system would be based upon the model
introduced in 16 provinces under the Agricultural Extension and Applied
Research Project (Loan 2405-TU). A second extension and research project is
under preparation and would be expected to place special emphasis on raising
productivity in irrigated areas. The Government would take measures to ensure
adequate maintenance of facilities constructed or rehabilitated under this
loan. DSI has adequate maintenance staff, and is fully capable of providing
appropriate maintenance with the provision of the equipment financed under the
ASAL (para. 47). GDRS has no maintenance staff and is expected to organize
farmer cooperatives to maintain the facilities it constructs. Most of the
GDRS drainage facilities constructed under this project would be subsurface
drains and would not require regular maintenance. However, the collector
drains constructed by GDRS would require periodic inspection and occasional
maintenance. GDRS operates a special fund for repairs financea through annual
budget allocations, and has agreed to use this fund for financing such
occasional maintenance work by contractors.
Environmental Impact
60.      The proposed project is confined to areas which are already developed
and served by fully or partially completed irrigation and drainage systems.
In the coastal areas, which predominate, the project is likely to have
beneficial effects by providing drainage to the waterlogged land in several
subproject areas with effluent Woing into the sea. In the case of inland
rivers which open into lakes, the salts and other pollutants carried would be
inconsequential and there would be no significant detrimental effects. The
improved drainage provided under the project would also be expected to reduce
mosquito breeding areas and lead to a reduction in the incidence of malaria.
Benefits and Risks
61.      The proposed program, at full development, would lead to improved
agricultural production on 220,000 halY of waterlogged land which would
benefit from improved drainage. The project is expected to benefit directly
1/   This estimate and the resulting economic benefits are conservative in
that they exclude the additional areas which would progressively become
waterlogged without the project. The extent of such area is difficult to
predict. The estimated benefitted area is less than the 668,000 ha shown
in para. 52 since only part of the total area without adequate drainage
becomes waterlogged, through collection of the excess water from other
parts of the area.



- 23 -
over 97,000 farm families.  The net disposable farm incomes of these farmers
at full development would average about three to six times higher than without
the project. In addition, as a result of the intensification of cropping
patterns and practices under the project, the annual demand for seasonal labor
would increase; it is estimated that at full development, about 350,000 more
people will find temporary employment on farms in the project area during the
off-peak farm labor season. Additional non-quantifiable benefits inciude a
strengthening of irrigation operations and investment management through
provision of staff training and improvements in investment selection criteria,
and a reduction in malaria incidence due to the improved drainage.
62.      Full development would be achieved in the tenth year of the project
(1996). At that time total incremental production would amount to about
$107 million per year equivalent in i985 economic prices. Of this, about
70 percent would be derived from increased production of cotton, 15 percent
from wheat, and the remainder from fodder and broad beans. No problem is
anticipated in the marketing of the additional output. Additional exports of
cotton and pulses and reduced imports of wheat are expected to generate about
$160 million of foreign exchange earnings/savings (net of about $11 million of
incremental imports of fertilizer and other inputs).
63.      The economic rate of return for the first time slice of the Core
Program is estimated at about 22 percent.  Sensitivity analysis indicates that
satisfactory returns would be achieved even with substancial increases in
investment costs or farm production costs. The benefits are sensitive to
variation in assumed yield levels and prices. However, the assumed yield
levels have already been achieved in similar areas not affected by
waterlogging, and do not take account of expected improvements through
improved technology. Changes in international prices are considered more
likely to affect the cropping pattern than to affect the economic viability of
all suitable crops in the project area. Thus the economic benefits from the
proposed investment program are relatively secure.
Project Risk;
64.      The proposed investment program would entail lower risk than many
others in Turkey because it would support tested technical improvements in
areas already supported by major irrigation infrastructure. Projected
cropping practices and yield levels for the areas to be improved already are
achieved in adjacent areas not effected by waterlogging and salinity.
Domestic and export market prospects are good and marketing channels are well
established. The main risks to achieving project objectives are:
(a)     Institutional capacity to prepare, evaluate and select
priority investments;
(b)     DSI and GDRS' ability to coordinate overlapping
implementation plans and schedules;
(c)     Availability of funding for the irrigation and drainage
subsector and the Core Program; and
(d)     Availability of adequate funding for 0&M.



-24 -
Measures are included to minimize these risks. Consultants' services and
training programs financed under the ASAL and this proposed loan are expected
to make a major contribution in increasing the capacity of DSI and GDRS to
carry out the selection and preparation of subprojects. DSI and GDRS would
evaluate the individual subprojects using criteria and methodology agreed with
the Bank. The availability of adequate local budgetary support, the absence
of which delayed some projects in the past, would also be a risk under the
proposed subloan. However, current economic conditions are substantially
improved over conditions in the past. The Government's indicative planning
figures for the irrigation subsector, in line with Government's policy
statements recorded in connection with the ASAL, show agriculture receiving
about 10 percent of the public investment budget, with about two-thirds of
this amount allocated for irrigation and drainage. Within the irrigation
subsector, the Government' s planning figures provide for progressive increases
in real terms of the share allocated for drainage and on-farm devclopment. To
minimize the risk of a funding shortfall, assurances have been received (see
para 55) that the Government would, for each year of the implementation
period, give the Bank an opportunity to comment on the proposed allocations
for the project prior to finalization of the budget. If a shortfall in annual
program funding should occur, selected subprojects in the program could be
deferred, thus extending program completion, without jeopardizing the
realization of individual project benefits or subsector objectives. Recent
progress (para. 46) in assessing and collecting water charges should also be
helpful in increasing availability of funds for maintenance.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
65.      I am satisfied the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.
