MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENATION
OF THE RENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR THE NORTHEAST BASIC EDUCATION II PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Federative Republic of Brazil for the equivalent of US$212.0 million to help
finance a basic education project in the Northeast of Brazil. The loan would be at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 15 years, including five years of grace.
2.         Brazil's levels of human resources development are exceedingly low compared with
other countries in the region and especially compared with other countries of similar per capita
income: the mean education of the population is 4.5 years of schooling, and over 60 percent of the
population has completed four years or less of schooling. (For comparison, only 7 percent of the
Korean population has had four or less years of schooling). Access to primary school is close to
universal, but repetition and dropout rates are among the worst in Latn America and two-thirds of
children do not complete the eight year primary school cycle. Conditions are worst in the Northeast,
where about 80% of all children do not complete primary school. Low completion rates in the
Northeast to some extent reflect access problems, especially in rural areas (the gross enrollment rate
in the Northeast is 93%, compared to 104% nationally). But a more important problem is the low
quality of schooling; books and materials are scarce and close to a quarter of teachers in the Northeast
have not completed primary school themselves. Education spending in most municipal systems in the
Northeast, at less than $50 per primary student per year, is far below the national average of US$
250-300 per studeat per year, and there is a need for the states and federal government to reduce
these disparities. Education management in state school systems (which handle about 35% of primary
erollments in the region) and municipal systems (with about 50% of enrollments) is generally weak
and education secretarats are often substanially overstaffed.
3.         Under Northeast Basic Education I, or EDURURAL (US$32 million, approved by the
Board in 1980), the Bank supported school construction, in-service teacher training and textbook
provision in rural primary schools. One of the key lessons learned from that project was that the
sustainability of these investments was limited by the absence of reforms in education system
management and financing. Thus, our dialogue with the Government since EDURURAL has
emphasized a more systemic approach to the education quality problems in the region, stressing the
need to address disparities between state and municipal systems, the need for shifts in the allocation of
resources, and the need to support urban (where the majority of students are enrolled) as well as rural
schools. Along with the proposed Second Northeast Basic Education Project, the Government is also
curny prepari  Northeast Basic Education m which follows the same design and will involve in
the other Northeast states. Ihere is strong support for these projects at the state level, and the
Ministry of Education has demonstrated a high degree of commitment as well, playing a strong and
coniwous role in project preparation despite three changes of Minister over the past year. Thanks to
a Japanese grant of US$1.4 million for the preparation of both Northeast projects, intensive work at
the state level was possible, which has developed the states' sense of ownership of the projects.

Relatonship of P&oWect to Bank Conmtra Assistance Strateg
4.         The Bank's country assistance strategy in Brazil is to support policies and investments
that will encoae economic growth and social development, and greater macroeconomic stability.
Our stregy strongly emphasizes the social sectors, because we believe that Brazil has significantly
underinvested in human resource development in the past, and that this not only undermines Brazil's
long term economic potental, but is also a contributing faor to high income inequality and poverty.
In all sectors, our strategy emphasizes Increased efficiency of public spending and better tagetng of
sevices to the poor. Within education, the focus of our strategy Is investment in primary education.
becuse the country is far from achieving universal completion of primary education, and because
primary education has the highest social returns and the greatest potential for increasing the equity of
economic opportunity. Our Hfforts in the social sectors in general are heavily concentrated in the
Northeast, where human resources are least developed and education and health systems are weakest.
Reflecting these priorities, we have continuously invested resources in the development of Northeast
Basic Education II and m, even when federal government support appeared uncertain.
Wed  Motive mid Dmif
5.         Proect Objtive. The project's goals are to increase student learning, reduce
repetition and dropout, and increase primary school completion rates in the four states, through
improvements in the quality of basic education and the efficiency of education management. The
project will also contribute to expansion of primary school access, but this is not its focus. At the
state level (97 percent of project costs), the projec will: i) streamline state education bureaucracies
an help them achieve a more efficient allocation of spending; ii) increase state and municipal primary
stdent access to textbooks and other instructional materials; iii) improve state and municipal
teahers' skllls and classroom effectiveness and the management skills of school directors; iv)
rehabiitate and exd state and municipal primary schools; and v) stimulate promisg new
approaches tO early primary education at the state and municipal level through an Innovations Fund.
6.          he project also has a component at the federal level (3 percem of project costs), to
strengthen Ministry of Education (MEC) capacity for key oversight and support functions, such as
national standardized student testing; planning, policy and norm-setting; and financial transfers to
equalize education spending across states. Finally, the project will support reform of the centalized
national wxtbook and school lunch distribution programs, in order to assure the timely and adequate
availability of learning materials in Brazilian primary schools and to improve the efficiency of school
lunch distibution. The insttional strengthening of MEC being carried out under the Northeast 11
project Is critical for the successful aministraton of both Northeast projects (which require the
Ministry to play a substatial coordination and supervision role) as well as for national education
managemen.
7.                           The statewlevel component will finance: i) technical assistance,
training, and office equipment (ncluding computers) to assist the states in streamlining their education
secretariats, modenizing education management and achieving a significant improvement in the
efficiency of education spending; ii) textbooks, workbooks, reading books, teachers' guides and other
instuctional maerials for all state and municipal students in grades 14; ii) in-service training to
improve the clssroom effectiveness of teachers and the management skills of school directors; iv) a



- 3 -
time-slice of the states' five year programs for rehabilitation and construction of state and municipal
schools; and v) grants to support innovative primary education programs at the state and municipal
levels. The time-slice component is innovative in that financing fot states' annual investment
programs will be conditional upon states' attainment of agreed annual targets for improving their
education staffing ratios and the allocation of education spending. If a state doer not meet Its
management efflciency targets in any given year, MEC and the Bank msy reallocate time-slice funds
to other, better-performing states.
S.         The federal level component will finance technical assistance, training, studies, overseas
study tours and graduate fellowships both at home and overseas, in connection with the following
objectives: i) strengthening the capacity of the federal government for education policy analysis and
norm-setting; ii) improving the efficiency and equity of federal education transfers; iii) building a
national capacity for student assessment; and iv) reform of the textbook and school lunch programs.
9.         Project Co. The project will be carried out over five years. The total cost is
estimated at US$378 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$38 million or
about 10 percem of the total. The proposed Bank loan of US$212 million equivalent will finance 65
percent of total estimated costs excluding local taxcs, or 56 percent of costs including taxes. The Bank
loan will finance 100 percent of foreign exchange costs and 51 percent of local expenditures. The
relatively high local cost financing under the project is a consequence of the project's small foreign
exchange component. It is justified by the need to encourage implementation of the significant policy
changes being sought under the project and by the fact that the project is targeted to Brazil's most
impoverished region. Retroactive financing of up to US$15 million will be provided for expenditures
incurred after July 31, 1992 (in the period up to twelve months prior to loan signing). A breakdown
of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and
the status of Bank group operations in Brazil are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 11298-BR, dated April 20, 1993, is also attached.
10.        Project Implementation. The implementing agencies will be the state education
secretariats of Ceara, Maranhao, Sergipe and Pernambuco, and the Ministry of Educatian (including
the Secretaiat of Basic Education, and the semi-autonomous agencies of the Ministry responsible for
education funding transfers, the school textbook and lanch programs, and national student testing and
research). In order to reduce disparities between state and municipal school systems, the states will
ensure that all support provided under the project is channeled to municipal schools as well as state
schools. The project will also encourage improvements in education management at the municipal
level though the criteria set for municipal participation in the Time-Slice component, which the states
will monitor. Finally, the project includes technical assistance to support strengthening of education
management at the municipal level.
Lessons 1-arned
11.        World Bank lending to Brazil for education began in the early 1970s. Initially, Bank
lending emphasized skills training and secondary-level technical education; other projects included
support for basic research at the federal universities. In recent years, in line with a shift in overall
World Bank policy, Bank lending to Brazil has focused increasingly on primary education,



-4 -
particularly in disadvantaged regions. Our first primary education project was Northeast Basic
Education I, known as EDURURAL. This US$32 million loan approved in 1980 sought to improve
primary schools in rural areas of the Northeast through financing of classroom construction and
upgrading, provision of textbooks and other teaching materials, in-service teacher training, and
institutional strengthening in selected poor municipalities throughout the nine Northeast states. An
important feature of the project was support for large-scale, longitudinal evaluation of the impact on
student learning and cost-effectiveness of the various types of investment financed under the project.
Key conclusions were that textbook provision and school upgrading are highly efficient investments -
in fact, each dollar invested in these areas under the project actally more than paid for itself in terms
of budgetary savings in the project states due to lower student repetition.
12.        The EDURURAL project ended in 1987. Our overall evaluation is that the project
succeeded in bringing additional books and other inputs to mral schools, and these had measurable
and highly cost-effective impacts on both student learning and overall education spending in the
project areas. However, the sustainability of these investments was limited by the absence of changes
in tea;her hiring, salaries, and overall financing (for example, inadequate funding for books and
school maintenance) that are fimdamental factors in the low quality of rural schools. Also, while the
package of investments delivered under the project had a dramatic impact on individual rural schools,
overall the project's resources were very dispersed (reaching less than one in five municipalities in the
nine states), and had almost no impact on the functioning of state and municip& education zystema in
the Northeast. In line with this assessment, the proposed Northeast Basic Education II and m
projects emphasize a more systemic approach, focusing on reforms of overall financing and
management of education in the selected states, and explicit attention to developing states' capacity for
sustained investment in education quality after the project period.
13.        A general lesson from our past education projects which is also supported by our project
experience in the health sector in Brazil is that keeping project design as simple as possible facilitates
project execution and increases the likelihood of project success. Given the weak institutions of
Northeast Brazil, the overwhelming problems of education quality in the region, and the inherent
difficulties of administering a multi-state project which involves multiple levels of government, a
guiding principle has been to try to keep both the proposed Northeast Basic Education II and
Northeast Basic Education m projects focused on a few key objectives, and to keep project financing
arrangements as simple as possible. Simplicity in project design has been explicitly pursued at the
expense of many other worthwhile investments in education quality, such as support for pre-
schooling, school health and nutrition interventions, or research, as are included in the Bank-financed
Sao Paulo Innovations in Basic Education Project. However, we believe that while a more
comprehensive project design is feasible in a state such as Sao Paulo, which has relatively strong
administrative capacity, such approaches are inappropriate in the Northeast.

17.        The project is not expected to have any environmental Impact.
Benefits, Risks and Sutainability
18.        The project wIll directly improve the quality of schooling for approximately 3 million
children per year in the first four grades of state and municipal primary schools in the four project
states, which is approximately 75 percent of totl primary enrollmens in these states. The project
target group also represents 45% of the total number of students enrolled in the first four grades of
primary school in the Northeast, and 30% of total primary enrollments in the Northeast. By
improving quality, the project will contibute to reduced dropout and repetition rates, increased
student learning, and higher graduation rates in the four states. Improved student flows would also
improve the efficiency of state and municipal spending on primary education. Technical assistance in
support of management reforms under the project should produce significant improvements in the
functioning of state education secretariats and will help state secretatiats develop a new role as
catalysts for improvements in municipal school quality as well. The project will also improve the
efficiency of textbook and school lunch procurement and distribution and strengthen the Ministry of
Education's capacity to carry out core oversight and technical assistance functions.
19.        A risk is that states' commitment to implementing politically difficult administrative
reforms and other actions to improve education quality and equity may falter after the change in state
governors in 1995 and that the expectea improvements in state and municipal education systems might
not result. This risk has been mitigated by the intensive preparation work at the state level dt  was
possible thanlks to the Japanese grant, and the states' sense of ownership in the project design and
conditionality. To reduce this risk further, the project design includes annual reviews of states'
implementation of their programs and an explicit system for reprogramming time-slice resources
across states or to other project components in the event of nonperformance by any state. A second
risk is slow implementation of the other state-level components, due to weaknesses in administrative
capacity. The project's cetral emphasis on strengthening states' institutional capacity, the amount and



- 7 -
types of technical assistance planned, and the supervision and coordination role which the Ministry of
Education is expected to play, will all mitigate this risk.
20.        The sustinability of the project is expected to be high, becarse one of its central
objectives is to improve the efficiency of education management and resource allocation at the state
and municipal levels, in order to ensure that these can sustain the ievel of education investments
supported under the project. The project's national component is also explicitly focused on reforms of
the national tex;book distribution system that would make annual provision of adequate schoolbooks
sustainable. The project's time-slice component creates incentives for states and m'unicipalities to
change their current patterms of resource allocation in order to achieve savings in somv areas and
permit increased investment in the cost-effective education inputs supported by the project (sucb as
books and materials). The project will also help pros -. education secretariats with the necessary
management tools (etter information systems and bette-Lrained staff) for achieving more efficient
resource allocation.

the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
