RAJASTHAN DAIRY DEVELOPMENl PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Dairying in India
i.        This project in Rajasthan will contribute to the development of
Indian agriculture, which accounts for about 40% of Indian GNP and employs 70%
of the total work force. Although Go!rernment of India's (GOI) emphasis in the
sector in recent years has been to increase the output of foodgrains, it is
attempting to diversify, where appropriate, with special attention to the dairy
sub-sector. Over the past two decades there has been a marked decline in per
capita consumption of milk, a primary source of animal protein for the bulk
of the population. Efforts are now being made to increase milk production
from 21 million tons in 1972 to 30 million by 1979. The project and its
companion, the Mladhya Pradesh Dairy Development Project, appraised at the
same time, are the second and third of a series designed to make a signif-
icant contribution towards this target. The first was the Karnataka Dairy
Development Project presented on June 13, 1974.
ii.       A large proportion of the world's bovine population is in India,
which has 17% of the world's cattle and 50% of its buffalo.  However, indig-
enous varieties produce verv low milk yields. Their main contribution has
been to provide draft power and to support a small livestock industry
accounting for 14% of the total agricultural sector's share of GNP and about
5% of total exports. To increase milk production significantly, a large-scale
effort to develop higher yielding animals and expansion of animal health care
and breeding facilities are required.
iii.      Crossbreeding of indigenous cattle with exotic varieties to produce
higher yielding dairy cattle has been conducted in India for many years, so far
with only limited success. With one rather notable exception, it has not been
accompanied by adequate institutional support, effective organization of small
and marginal farmers (who produce most of the milk) into economically viable
units, development of adequate milk collection, processing and marketing. Nor
has there been adequate provision of animal health care and technical services
to farmers. Few farmers use their land principally for dairy production, which
is essentially a subsidiary farm activity. If a significant increase in milk
production is to be achieved, additional feed must be made available or more of
the available feed must be reserved for high producing animals. The demand
for cereal grains as human food and the favorable export position of oilseeds
and oilcake preclude any significant increase in the supply of concentrate
feed for livestock. It is, therefore, important to develop animal production
systems whichl will result in more efficient use of available supplies and
encourage development of higher quality forages where these are now grown.
However, by integrating leguminous fodder into the existing farming systems,
hligher overall crop yields would result which would largely compensate for
some diversion of land to fodder.



- ii -
iv.       A notable bright spot in the Indian dairy picture is the successful
experience over the past 25 years, of the Kaira District Cooperative Milk
Producers Union Ltd (AMUL). AMUL is centered on the formation and operation
of hundreds of village milk producers cooperatives (a typical member owns two
buffalo and tills less than 1 ha). The village cooperatives are welded to-
gether into a cooperative Union which owns and operates facilities for milk
and feed processing, collection and distribution and provides its members
with a full range of technical 3ervices. The Union is responsible for setting
milk prices and obligated to buy milk in any quantity from members. Thus,
the farmer is assured of year round outlet for his milk at fair prices. Mem-
bers are provided with a package of services which includes artificial insemi-
nation (AI) and routine veterinary health coverage, sale of concentrate feed
and fodder seed, and training. The outstanding success of AMUL has encouraged
GOI and several states to foster the establishment of similar programs in
other parts of the country.
Status of Dairy Development in Rajasthan
v.        Rajasthan, has considerable potential for dairy development due to
higlh agricultural potential and crop yields in the eastern districts where
the project is situated. Rajasthan is in the northwest of India, and is the
country's second largest state in area but among the smallest six in popula-
tion. It is almost the size of Spain and its population of 27 million is
slightly less than that of Burma. About 73% of the population is engaged in
agriculture, which in 1971/72 accounted for 40% of total state income. Of the
14.5 million ha. under cultivation, about 2.5 million ha. are irrigated. The
annual 1962/63-1971/72 rate of agricultural growth during the period was 2.8%.
The average holding is 6.8 ha; 60% are 2 ha. or less.
vi.       In this agricultural environment dairying, although a subsidiary
activity, provides many farmers with their only source of cash income. Dairy
animals are mainly low yielding nondescript native types. Crossbreeding of
cattle through AI was initiated in the mid-sixties, but the effectiveness of
the AI and health services has been limited due to shortage of qualified
personnel and facilities.
Vii.      The feed situation in the state is comparatively better than average
for India, but there is, nevertheless, a shortage. There is considerable scope
for increasing production of high quality leguminous forages by small farmers
through the integration of these crops into existing farming systems.
viii.     Total Rajasthan milk production is about 5 million liters per day or
about 190 grams per capita, well above the national average of 112 grams per
capita per day. However, dairy processing and marketing are largely unde-
veloped, therefore, village milk ils mostly converted into ghee and only about
40Z of the milk is consumed in fluid form. The only dairy plant (Government
owned) in Jaipur (project area), supplies about 8% of the urban milk market.
ix.       A dairy cooperative movement based on the AMUL pattern was started in
1970 in connection with the Government milk schemes to assure milk supply. The



- iii -
movement is slowly picking up momentum and societies with bylaws similar to
AMUL would be incltded in the proposed project.
The Project Description
x.        The proposed IDA credit of US$27.7 million would assist in the
development of an integrated program for increasing milk production in rural
areas, involving about 240,000 farm families, most of whom farm less than
2 ha or are landless, through a six-year program focusing on quality cross-
breeding, animal health, increased fodder production and the development of
milk collection, processing and marketing facilities. Village cattle owners
would form Dairy Cooperative Societies (DCS), which would in turn be grouped
into five milk producers' unions following the AMUL pattern in Gujarat. Each
union would own and operate dairy and feed plants and would be capable of
providing AI, animal health, training and extension, milk collection and
marketing services to the DCS. In addition to the establishment of about
1,800 DCS and the five unions, a Rajasthan Dairy Development Corporation (RDDC)
would also be formed to coordinate project implementation and produce purebred
exotic breeding stock. The State Department of Animal Husbandry in consulta-
tion with the College of Veterinary & Animal Sciences, would operate a
Biological Veterinary Vaccine Institute (BVVI), a diagnostic laboratory,
with funds provided under the project. An extensive training program would
also be provided. Each union would also operate an extension service involving
one trained extension worker for ten DCS. Consultant services would be
provided to assist RDDC in dairy engineering and plant construction, marketing
of milk and dairv products, milk processing plant operation, the organization
of DCS and fodder animal production. About 50 farms of progressive owners
would be improved for demonstration purposes in fodder production, crossbred
rearing and milking hygiene.
The Project Implementation
xi.       The RDDC would be the main bodv for implementation and coordination
of project activities and would play an essential role in the initial estab-
lishment of dairy cooperative societies and milk producers' unions. RDDC would
build dairy plants and other facilities under the project for the Unions which
would operate them once they are adequately capitalized and staffed and a
sufficient number of DCS's organized.
xii.      RDDC would engage the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) to
help in recruitment, training and field supervision of each spearhead team
and the union staff. The NDDB would also assist RDDC in design and construc-
tion of milk and feed plants and carry out marketing studies to determine
plant product mix capacities, prepare specifications for requesting construc-
tion bids, and supervise construction.
xiii.     Total estimated project cost is US$51.8 million equivalent including
duties and taxes and the foreign exchange component of US$12.7 million is about
25%. The proposed IDA credit of US$27.7 million would cover 53% of total
project cost. The remaining 47% would be financed by GOI (16%), GOR (19%),
ARC and participating banks (11%0 and farmers (1%). IDA funds would be



- iv -
channelled in two ways. (i) Credit funds for union and RDDC investments in
facilities, totalling US$22.3 million, would be made available by GOI to the
Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC) repayable over 15 years at 7.5%
annual interest, minimum. GOI would bear the exchange risk. ARC would
in turn on-lend the funds to participating banks at a minimum annual interest
rate of 8%. The banks would lend to RDDC and the unions at 11% per annum
minimum. Loans to the unions and RDDC would have upto 6 years grace and re-
payment over 9 years. Repayments to ARC would be scheduled to coincide with
those by the unions and RDDC to the banks. The interest rates would be in line
with prevailing interest rates, and the margins, reasonable in relation to
the risk element involved, and the need for appraisal and supervision of
individual loans. (ii) US$5.4 million for consultants, importation of exotic
cattle, BVWI and diagnostic laboratory, the union training centers and exten-
sion programs, would be channelled through GOI to GOR.
xiv.      Materials and equipment valued at US$18.2 million or 35% of total
project cost would be procured on the basis of international competitive
bidding in accordance with the IDA Guidelines. Domestic suppliers would be
accorded the usual preference of 15% or the rate of customs duty, whichever is
lower. Procurement of importecl exotic dairy heifers, bulls, and frozen semen
(US$0.2 million) would be on thie basis of quotations from at least three
countries free from foot and mouth disease where suitable animals are available.
xv.       Other equipment valued at US$11.7 million would be procured locally
due to the small sizes of individual items and the time spread.
xvi.      Buildings and civil works (valued at about IJS$9.4 million) for the
RDDC farms, union dairies and feed mills would be dispersed in time and place
and would be unsuitable for international bidding. They would be constructed
by local contractors selected tlhrough local competitive bidding.
xvii.     The proceeds of the IIDA credit would be disbursed against the full
c.i.f. costs of imported equipment and materials and the ex-factory cost of
local equipment bid internationally; against the full c.i.f. costs of imported
cattle and semen; against the full expenditures for consultant services and
fellowships; against 70% of expenditures on locally procured equipment and civil
works; and against 80% of the cost of the union training centres and the exten-
sion programs.
Economic Benefits
xviii.    The project would provide a number of important economic and social
benefits. The direct economic benefit would be the increased production of
milk, estimated at 475,000 tons/year by year ten (26% of state total). Some
240,000 farming households, or approximately 1.3 million people, would benefit
bv raising of their standard of living and providing increased cash family
income. The project's establishment of 1800 DCS, five unions and RDDC would
provide employment for about 8,000 as well as supporting a milk transport
service, consisting largely of 100 owner-operators. Consumers would also



-v -
benefit from better milk supply. Milk borne diseases, such as TB, would
decrease significantly. Based on the quantified incremental costs and
benefits, the economic rate of return of the project is about 31%.

India from March - April 1974 comprisinig Messrs. C. Wolffelt, A. Seth (IDA)
sitl(n A. Pursell, C. Percival and J. l). von Pischke (consultants). Mir. N. Krafft

II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.()1     Rajasthan is in north west India.  It is the second largest state
with an area of 34 million ha (10% of Tndia's total) and a population of 27
rillion (5% of India's total).  rhe capital is .Jaipur with a population of
8LJ0,000.  The state has three main ecological regJors:  eastern, with an
annnval rainfall of 400-800 mm, with mostly alluvial soils and high ;agricul-
2-ural production; southern, with an annual rainfall above 600 mm, which is
h;lly with red soils mostly suitable for limited livestock production, and
western, with less than 400 mm precipitation and sandy soils, which is mostly
arid or semiarid.
ALri culture
2.02      About 73X of the population is engaged in agriculture.  Approxi-
wmately 13 million ha (37%) of the state is desert and largely uncultivated.
1f   Thc first dairy development project for the state of Karnatak-i was
approved by IDA on June 13, 1974 (Report 431a-IN of May 21, 1974).



Of the rest, forests cover one million ha and 11.5 million are under rainfed
crops mainly millet, jowar (sorghum) and maize. About 2.5 million ha (18%)
is irrigated. Irrigated crops include wheat, cotton, paddy, sugarcane, millet,
pulses, oilseeds, fodder crops (alfalfa and berseem), fruit and vegetables.
The annual rate of agricultural growth during 1962/63 to 1970/71 was 2.8%
(Population growth rate was 2.3%).  The average holding is 6.8 ha.
B.  The Dairy Subsector 1/
The AtVJL Model
2.03      Thie Kaira District Cooperative Milk Produicers Union Ltd. (AMUL),
lieadquartered at Anand in Gujarat State, is a model for dairy development
well adapted to India. AMUL is centered on the formation of hundreds of vil-
lage milk producers' cooperatives welded together into a cooperative Union
whiich owns and operates its own milk and feed processing, collection and dis-
tribution facilities. The Union now numbers about 225,000 families in 785
village cooperatives and processes about 150 million 1 annually. The Union
Is governed by a farmer-elected Board and operated by hired market-oriented
managers responsible for setting milk prices. AMUL members are provided
with a package of services, incLuding veterinary health coverage and training
facilities, financed by the Union from milk levies, and concentrate feed and
fodder seed paid for by produce-s through deductions from their milk sales.
Five similar Unions have been formed in Cujarat and were recently amalgamated
into a Federation. The success of AMUL has encouraged GOI and several states
to promote similar programs in other parts of the country (Annex 3).
N.ational Dairy Dcvelopment Boarc (NDDB)
'.04      NI)DB was registered in 1965 to step up planning and execution of
dairy development on a national scale. It is located in Anand, Gujarat, and
its close association with AMUL has enabled it to build up the most authorita-
tive expertise in India on dairy technology and the AMUL. model.
Livestock and Breeds
2.05      The present bovine popilation of Rajasthan is about 12.5 million
cattle (7% of India's total) and 4.7 million buffalo (9% of India's total).
Respectively, 4.6 and 2.5 millioni represent the breedable milking stock.
Around 50% of these are in milk.  Most cattle do not conform to any specific
breed although there are seven well defined breeds in the state. Milk pro-
duction varies considerably with breeds, feeding and management practices;
it averages about 500 1/lactation for cows and 800 1/lactation for buffalo.
Crossbreeding with exotic purebreds mainly Jersey was successfully initiated
in 1971 in Jaipur through the services of the Government of Rajasthan (GOR)
I!  The Rajasthan dairy subsector is described in Annex 1.



-3-
Animal Husbandrv Department. There are now eight cattle breeding farms in
the state producing pedigree bulls of the main breeds.
Feeds and Feeding
2.06      The most common cattle feeds are byproducts of agricultural crops,
cultivated fodders, perennial pasture grasses and concentrates. Increased
dairy herds and milk production under the. project (Annex 3) depend on an
adequate supply of high quality forage and balanced premixed feed (Annex 1).
GOR measures to encourage fodder production include demonstration farms for
improved pastures and better management, seed multi-plication farms, distribu-
tion of hybrid napier seedlings, loans and grants for pasture improvement and
for fencing of pasture land and subsidies for fodder seed and chaffcutters.
Hiowever, the largest scope for increased production of high quality forage
is bv integration of these fodder crops into existing irrigated farms by
effective extension work.
2.07      In 1971-72 Rajasthan produced 6.4 million tons of foodgrains (6%
of India's total) equivalent to about 240 kg yearly per capita (India average:
190) (Annex 1). This agricultural production comes mostly from eastern Rajas-
than where the project would be sited (3.01). This would assure the supply
of thie balanced feed ingredients required under the project. By year ten,
the incremental foodgrain requirements would only represent about 0.9% of
total state production.
2.08      The marginal productivitv of a crossbreed would be about 1 1 of
milk per kg. of balanced feed (0.25 kg. foodgrain ingredient). The nutritive
value of 1 1 of milk would be about 35 g. protein and 750 calories, comparable
to 25 g. protein and 850 calories for 0.25 kg. foodgrain (as meal).  At the
village level the cost of milk is about Rs 1 per 1 and the cost of 0.25 kg.
of foodgrain only about Rs 0.25; but milk has a higher content of minerals
(Ca) and a broader spectrum of vitamias (A, B2, C, D). GOI rightly considers
the trade off fully justified in view of the need for increasing the avail-
ability of milk in fluid or powdered form to the Indian population not only
to improve the diet of infants but also for the large low-income urban popula-
tion whose average daily intake of milk and milk products is less than 100
Milk and milk products provide the only acceptable source of animal protein
for the large vegetarian segment of the population.
Milk Production
2.09      Dairying in Rajisthan is largely a subsidiary activity to crop
farming though in many instances it provides a daily cash income.  Over
80Z of the cows and buffalo are kept in villages.  The average size herd
is 2 - 3 breedable head per family.  Milk producers are of 3 categories:
(a) the landless who represent 15% of the rural population, keep one to
two animals and purchase all feeds and fodders; (b) the mixed farmer
(cropping and livestock) whose main inconie is from sale of crops surplus
to household needs, to whom dairying is a sideline which utilizes crop bv-
products. lie may use a small area of his land for growing fodder (alfalfa
and berseem) purchasing small amotnts of concentrate, herd size is about two



- 4 -
to five animals; (c) the urban milk producer with lherds up to 20 head, who
Ourcaases all the feed and fodller and buys cows at peak production, selling
them when dry.  In west Rajasthan, nomads keep herds of up to 200 head.
Total milk production in the st:ate is about 5 million 1/day equivalent to
about 190 grams/capita, well above the national average of 110/115. The
urban centers are the natural markets for village milk, but lack of adequate
transportation compel distant villagers to convert most of that surplus
into -hee (butter oil.), wasting some of the skimmed milk. Only about 40%
of the milk is consumed as fluid.
2.10      Rajasthan has an undeveloped dairy processing and marketing
'-tructure resulting in severe shortage in the urban centers during the lean
season with marked price escalations. The first milk processing plant was
cstablished by GOR in Jaipur in 1965.  However, during the Fourth Five-Year
Plan (1969-1974), construction was initiated on four dairy plants in the
cities of Bikaner (Operation flood), 1/ Jodhpur, Ajmer (Project Area) and
Kota and are now in the completion stage. Milk would be supplied through
dairy cooperative societies orgamized along the AMUL model with introduction
of crossbreeding. There are already eight milk producers unions registered
in the state, and two are in the Project area (3.08). These unions are still
in a developing stage.
Government Services, Research, Education
'.11      Government services for animal health and livestock development are
provided by the GOR Animal Husbandry Department. It operates 342 Veterinary
'hospitals and dispensaries, and L44 AI centers. Due to lack of qualified
personnel and transportation, AI services are not very effective and only 25%
of the semen produced is utilize(l. Endemic cattle diseases as elsewhere in
India, are rinderpest, foot and rmouth, blackquarter, hemorragic septicaemia
and anthirax. Limited vaccines are produced in the Biological Production
Institute of Jaipur which is obsolete and would be replaced under the project
to meet the needs of the state. The Danish Project Assistance Program has
unlder consideration the production of foot and mouth vaccine. It is already
cormmitted to a 125,000 dose/year frozen semen bank for Bikaner. The state
))as a Faculty of Veterinary and Animal Sciences at Bikaner, a constituent
(ollege of the University of Udaipur. There is also an Animal Husbandrv
'chool and an AI training center, both at Jaipur, and a livestock field
investigation center at Bassi, near Jaipur.
1/   A GOI ongoing project for increasing milk supplies to the cities of
Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta and Madras with financial assistance from WFP
in the form of milk powder (126,000 tons) and butter (42,000 tons).
Istimated completion:  1977.

C.  CGoverment Policies
2.12      The policies followed by the GCUR in the dairy suibector are essen-
tially those established by the GOI in its Five-year plans. Allocations for
the dairy subsector in the first three development plnr.ns were inadequate.
GOI objectives in the Fourtli and current Fifthi Plan are to attain food grain
self-sufficiency and to diversify agricultural production.  Within the live-
stoclc sector, dairy development has been given greatest eiplbasis in GOI's
Fifth Plan since milk ancl milk products provide the primarv source of inimal
protcin for the large ve-eterian segment of the poptulation.  The daily per
capita availability has however fallen from 120 (1970) to 112 g. (1973). GO'
plans for dairy developrient have been stimulated by the successful AMUL experi-
ence and in the Fiftth Five-Year Phan, GOT is encouraging the AMIL model as the
basic means to increase milk production. In addition, animal, production,
health and Al facilities are proposed to be improved at starc level and more
emphasis placed on increasing crossbred cattle.  GOI would provide a cross-
bred calf subsidy of Rs 200 per head, in the form of pro-mixed calf feed, to
encourage farmers to adopt better feeding practices and so avoid losses of
valuable crossbred heifers due to malnutrition. The Foturth Plan provides
funds fsr the construction of a total eight dairy plants in Rajasthan, four
of which are soon to be commissioned.
D.  Agricultural Credit
2.13      Institutional agricultural credit is provided directly by cooper-
ative banks, commercial banks and GOI indirectly through the Reserve Bank
of India (RBI) and the Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC) (Annex 2).
Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC)
2.14      ARC is an intermediary channel for 15 current TBRD/II)A credit nro-
jects. 1/ It was established in 1963 as a subsidiary of the Reserve Bank
of India (RBI) to provide the on-lending agricultural credit institntions
with a supplemental source of medium and long-term finance. With the RBI it
sponsors orientation and training programs for management and technical staff
of banking institutions. Tts expanding technical division assists banks in
appraising the techno-economical feasibility of projects and supervision of
ongoing schemes.
Cooperative Banks
2.15      The cooperative banking system is the villager's most important
source of institutional credit.  The Rajasthan Cooperative Banks, which
11   Full details of ARC,s organization and financial operations arc given in
Annex 4 of the IJttar Pradesh Agricultural Credit Appraisal Report No.
107a-IN, April. 12, 1973.



supply short and medium-term loans, have a thiree-tier structure: State Apex
Cooperative Bank, 25 Central Cooperative Banks and 7,700 primary agricul-
tural credit societies. The State Cooperative Land Development Bank, which
supplies long-term credit, is a federation of 37 Primary Land Development
Banks (PLDB), at least one for each district. LDB lending has been about
Rs 35 M to Rs 45 M annually, with almost 98% being for minor irrigation
(wells and pumpsets). Credit needs for minor irrigation in Rajasthan have
been assessed by Government and the Rajastlhan Groundwater Board, and ARC
refinance is available to meet these needs. Interest rates to the ultimate
borrowers have recently been revised and now range from 11 - 13% per annum.
The on-lending institutions generally receive a spread of 2 - 3%.  Cooperative
Banks have been plagued with problems of low recoveries and overdues partially
related to droughts and crop failures but largely due to inefficient manage-
ment. These problems in turn affect their ability to lend. Only banks
meeting the criteria listed in Annex 2 Appendix 1 would be eligible to parti-
cipate in the project.
Commercial Banks
2.16      Since 1969 commercial banks have increased their role in providing
institutional rural credit. Designated banks were charged with assessing
local resources and credit needs, mobilizing capital and improving rural
credit supply, in specific districts and rehabilitation of weak credit socie-
ties. Experiencee to date has Deen modest. Commercial banks are nevertheless
attempting to expand into agricultural operations based on sound lending
)rinciples with good technical support.  Prevailing interest rates are 11 -
1   per annutm.
III. THE PROJECT AREAS
GCnieral Description
3.01      The project would be in eastern Rajasthan, see Map, in the milksheds
approximately identified witlh the districts of Jaipur, Ajmer, Alwar, Bharatpur,
Sawai-4adhopiir and Tonk selected for their potential for growing feed and for-
a,e and for dairy livestock development. Each district capital is also an im-
portant urban center for marketing fluid milk and dairy products. These dis-
tricts are not involved in any other on-going or proposed IDA project for
Rajastihan.
3.02      The June-September monsoon accounts for most of the rain varying
from about 500 mm (Ajmer) to 700 mm (Sawai-Madhopur) in the project area.
Rajasthan is known for extreme climatic variations, its minimum temperature
is about 5°C with maximum over 400C in summer (March - June). Total rural
population in the project area is about 6.6 million, distributed between
9900 villages, each of about 120 households.



-7-
3.03      The project area covers approximately 5.6 million ha, (16% of
the state) 3.4 million ha (60Z) under cultivation and 0.4 million ha (12%)
under irrigation.  The average holding is 5 ha with 70% less than 3 ha.
The breedable stock is about 1.3 million cows and 1 million buffalo. The
average household owns about 1.3 cows and 1 buffalo.
Status of Dairy Development
3.04      Approximately one third of the facilities operated by the Depart-
ment of Animal Husbandry (2.11) for animal health services are located in
the project area. However due to shortage of trained staff and poor communi-
cations the services lack effectiveness. The milk production in the area is
estimated at 2 million 1/day with capacity for processing only about 5%
of this total in four plants.
Milk Marketing
3.05      In Rajasthan, as in most of India, there are three main channels for
milk supply to the urban market: (i) traditional village agents, (ii) city
producers; (iii) cooperative sector. The traditional village agent, acting
as a collector/middleman for private vendors in the cities is the main supplier.
The supply from city producers is also significant representing about 20% - 30%
of the market.
3.06      Milk prices in Rajasthan are not controlled and the urban market
price for raw milk varies according to type and season from about Rs 1.50 to
2.00 per 1. GOR dairies market pasteurized milk in 1/2 1 bottles at subsi-
dized prices: Rs 1.35 per 1 of 3% fat (.Jaipur). This subsidy does not per-
init paying fair prices to the village producers, therefore, procurement vol-
uime is low and operating losses result from low throughput. Accordingly, the
GOR milk scheme in Jaipur accommodates only about 8% of the urban demand
(presently 110,000 1/day). In addition to the Jaipur plant (20,000 1/day),
the following plants are also in the project area: Ajmer, (Union owned)
(30,000 1/day) to be completed in 1974 and Alwar, (Union owned) (10,000 1/day).
In Elharatpur there is a private milk powder plant of 40,000 1/day. The milk
is brouglht to the processing plants, in 40 1 cans, by contract trucker while
aIt the village level, agent/collectors procure and transport it to collection
prints by bicycle or oxcart.
3.07      '-lost agent/collectors pay tlie village producer between Rs 1 - and
1.50 per 1; though ustually offering an inferior prodluct, they operate from
villages comparatively close to the urban centers and are serious competitors
co ore,ranized milk schemes which have to bear the hi-,her cost of processing.
Under the present marketing system, the city producer selling direct to  a
regular consumer clientele is also competitive with the agent/collector even
though the former must buy all his feed supply.  To reduce feede costs many
city producers purchase cows in mill: anO! sell them at the end of their lacta-
tion; they do not therefore generally rear calves. The unions would gradually
displace the private ,suppliers, who by year eight would only control about
20, of the urban markets.



-8-
Dairy Cooperatives
3.08      The Dairy Cooperative novement in the project area came into exist-
ence with the creation of the govrernment milk schemes to assure supply for
their processing plants. Due to the subsidized milk price policy of the GOB
dairies and other organizational shortcomings, the cooperative movement did
not develop. As a result in 1972 the Animal Husbandry Department commenced
the implementation of dairy cooperative societies organized along the AMUL
pattern. In the project area there are now about 100 such societies formed
under two unions: (Ajmer and Alwar), which would form part of the project
(4.05).
IV. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      In an area of suitable potential (eastern Rijasthan), the project
would provide, over six years, the necessary inputs to develop an enclave
of high milk production. It would not only benefit the area itself but
also generate a significant surplus of milk that would be channeled to
other large deficit markets outside the state. It would organize village
cattle owners to form Dairv Cooperative Societies (DCS) which would be
grouped into unions similar to the AMUL scheme in Gujarat. The unions
would employ technicians and managers, and be controlled by farmers. Each
union would own and manage its own dairy and feed plant and would provide
milk collection, marketing, veterinary, AT and extension services to the
member DCS. About 240,000 families, most of whom farm less than 2 ha or are
landless, would be involved. The Rajasthan Dairy Development Corporation
(RDDC) would be set tip to coordinate and implement the project through the
unions.
4.02      The project comprises:
(a)  Establishment of about 1,800 DCS, five milk producers unions
and the RDDC,
(b)  Importation and multiplication of purebred exotic breeding
stock and an associated Al program of crossbreeding native
village cattle with high producing exotic breeds. Provision
of extension programs to encourage production of fodder,
mixed farming and improved animal husbandry,
(c)  Construction of five union dairy plants and cattle feed mills;
and the establishment of milk collection routes and milk
chilling centers,



- 9
(d)  Establishment of one regional diagnostic laboratory (DLAB)
and a plant for production of biological veterinary vaccines
(BVVI),
(e)  Provision of consultant services to assist RDDC,
(f)  Provision of a training center for each union (UTC), an
extensive training program for developing instructors
for training technical and field staff, and fellowships
for key personnel.
The project does not include a farm credit component, as crossbreds are not
available for purchase. Credit for dug wells for increasing fodder produc-
tion would be available through existing ARC schemes for minor irrigation
(4.09).
B. Detailed Features
New Institutions
4.03      The Rajasthan Dairy Development Corporation (RDDC) to be established
under thie project, would be the center for coordination and implementation of
project activities. It would be the base from which consultants and other
expertise would schedule and direct the organization of the unions and through
them the implementation of the DCS. To ensure that the essential AMUL features
are adopted when establishing the DCS and the unions, RDDC would engage the
services of NDDB on a contract basis. NDDB would assist in recruiting and
training the nucleus staff of RDDC, unions and spearhead teams. NIDDB would
supervise the implementation of the DCS during the first year. NDDB would
also assist in a marketing study (4.12) and furnish consulting services to
the RD,DC in the preparation of engineering specifications for the procurement
of equipment and construction of the dairy plants and feed mills as well as
for evaluation of tenders (6.10). It is a condition of credit effectiveness
that (i) RDDC had been established under articles of association acceptable
to IDA; and (ii) that RDDC had engaged NDDB to assist in the training of
consultants and RDDC and union management staff, and provide other consulting
services. Assurances were also given that about year five, the future role
of RDDC either as a corporation, a federation of the unions, or other, would
be reviewed witlh IDA.
4.04      Five unions -/ would be established each incorporating about 300/400
DCS implemented over a five year period, making a total about 1,800 DCS.
By-laws would be similar to AMUL's (Annex 3). The principal functions and
1/   RDDC would organize the unions wlhich would implement the DCS; RDDC would
bear the initial cost as the unions could only be legally constituted
after at least 25 DCS had been registered.



- 10 -
responsibilities of a union would be to:  (a) organize and effect the imple-
mentation of the DCS; (b) assist the DCS with organization, management,
inspection and auditing; (c) es;tablish and supervise milk and cattle feed
transportation; (d) process andl market the members' milk and operate the
feed mills; (e) provide animal health and breeding services; (f) demonstrate
improved mixed farming and fodder production techniques.
4.05       The principal functions and responsibilities of a DCS would be
to: (a) act as a center for milk collection (b) effect regular payments to
producers; (c) sell balanced feed; (d) provide AI services; (e) communicate
cooperative and technical information to members. The two existing unions
in the project area and their 70 odd AMUTL Type societies would be incorporated
under the project after a review by ARC and approval by IDA of their by-laws,
capitalization and management strLcture (assurances would be sought). No other
type of existing society would he incorporated with the project. Assurances
were given by GOR that the five unions and the 1,800 DCS would be formed
under by-laws acceptable to IDA.
CrossbreedinQ and Milk Produetion
4.0h       Milk prodtuction would begin from native cattle and buffalo and would
; e gradually increased, primarily bv upgprading low producing native cows
thr,ough an AI program of crossbreeding with high producing exotic breeds
(mainly Jersey, although other Exotic L.reeds would also he considered) and
by better nutrition.
4.07       RDDC would own and operate an exotic bull breeding farm near Jaipur,
to be financed under the project. The breeding farm would supply bulls
(exotic and buffalo) to the five union bull farms (AI centers).  Initially a
foulndation herd of about 100 in-calf heifers would be imported for the breeding
farm and 30 bulls to be supplied to the b5ull farms of the unions. Thc bull
farms would supply fresh semen that would be delivered daily to the DCS by
tlhe nmlk collection trucks, following the pattern of the AMUL model.
4.08       The low quality crop r2sidues, which traditionally comprise the main
roughage component of the native animal's diet are inadequate to maintain
crossbrcds and would be supplemented with higlh quality green fodder and balanced
concentrate feed in pellet form. Advised by the proposed extension services,
farmers with irrigated land would be encouraged to grow fodder for their own
use and also for sale to otlher members. Under present conditions production
of alfalfa renders a net income to the farmer comparable to that from wheat.
4.09       The incremental fodder demand of the crossbreedes by year ten, would
require a total 20,000 ha of irrigated land (Annex 1). There are about 280,000
wells in the six districts of the project and about 25%, equivalent to an
irrigated area of 40,000 ha woulc belong to farmers expected to join the DCS.
Ihis area would appear ample for fodder production, however, about 15,000
additional wells would be dug (over a 10 year period) allowing for members
with irrigated land who would cortinue growing other crops.  Ground water is



- 11 -
available and assurances were given at negotiations that GOI, GOR and ARC
would ensure that loans would be available to eligible DCS members for minor
irrigation for fodder production. Each union would also operate a feed mill
of about 75 tons per day capacity for producing premixed balanced concentrate
feed. Construction of these mills would be matched to the growth of demand
for feed.
4.10      By year ten of a DCS, all native cows would have been replaced by
crossbreds. However mainly due to improved calving rates, the average DCS
member cattle herd would have increased from about 210 Animal Units (AU) in
year three to 260 (22% increase) in year ten. The membership of a typical
DCS would be about 30% (58) of the total village households in the first year,
50% (97) in the second year, stabilizing at 70% (136) in the third year.
Based on the experience at AMUL, the DCS would be implemented with the fol-
lowing phasing, similar for all five unions: year one: 60 DCS, year two:
70; year three: 80; year four: 80 and year five: 70. Thus total project
milk collection 1/ would only be 12 million 1 in year one, increasing to 195
million 1 in year five and 571 million in year ten (Annex 4 Table 4). The
incremental milk production 2/ would be 106 million 1 (100% increase) in year
five and 512 million 1 (280% increase in year ten).
Milk Collection, Processing and Marketing
4.11      Milk would be collected from the DCS along defined and economi-
cally viable routes involving about 13 - 15 DCS in each route. Milk from
the DCS would be picked up daily and transported to the dairy plants by a
fleet of both owned and hired trucks operated by the union; 15 chilling
centers would be provided for pooling milk from distant routes serviced by
five 13,000 1 capacity road tankers for freighting the milk to the plants.
4.12      The project provides for the construction of five milk processing
plants each with an initial capacity of 100,000 1/day, which would be expanded
in two stages (Year 4 and 6) to 200,000 1/day to match the increase in milk
supplies under the project (Annex 4 Table 4). One of the plants would involve
the expansion of the 30,000 1/day plant being completed at Ajmer. The exist-
ing plants at Jaipur and Alwar are too small and outdated and assurances
were given by COR that they would be phased out or relocated after the new
plants come on stream in year 3.  General layouts and building design would
allow this expansion in a functional manner. Due to surplus production, on
an average, plants would be equipped to retail about one third of their volume
in the urban narket, one tlhird for bulk shipment in rail tankers (assurances
were given that these would be available) and one third for conversion into
milk powder (Annex 4 Table 10).  Jaipur and Ajmer plants would be equipped to
meet a comparatively large urban demand, the other three plants located in
smaller urban centers would be equipped principally to produce milk powder
1/   Excludes milk retained by farmer for family and calf feeding.
2/   Includes milk retained by farmer for family and calf feeding and
assumes that the present traditional production would remain static.



- 12 -
and deliver pasteurized milk in bulk by rail to Delhi which is expected to
remain a deficit area for several years.  The NDDB would assist in conducting
marketing studies prior to plant construction to determine the appropriate
product mix for each plant.   With these provisions the unions would not
have to cut back milk collections cluring the life of the project, even in
the flush season, for lack of processing capacity. Milk would be retailed
both in bulk and bottles (1/2 1), from union owned booths and private foodstores
in the major urban centers.
Biological Veterinary Vaccine Institute and Diagnostic Laboratory
4.13      The project would include a new facility for the production of
veterinary vaccines (BVVI) to meet the state's requirements of 5 million
doses a year. Supply of vaccine is inadequate in Rajasthan. The plant
would be administered by the Animal Husbandry Department in consultation with
RDDC. The unions would purchase their vaccine requirements from the Institute
(Annex 7). To improve the crossbreeding, animal health and veterinary suppor.
programs, the project would provide for one fully equipped diagnostic laboratory
(DLAB) which would be located in the project area. The laboratory would be
administered by GOR in consultation with the College of Veterinary and Animal
Science at Bikaner.
Technical Assistance, Training and Extension
4.14      The project provides for the following consultants, some expected
to be available in India, to assist RDDC in implementing the project:
(a) A dairy plant engineer to check plans, layouts, specifications,
evaluate tenders and supervise construction.
(b) A dairy processing expert to train union plant personnel
in operating the new plants, process monitoring and qual-
ity control.
(c) A mass-media communications expert to assist spear head teams
in developing visual and other aids to transmit effectively
the concept of the AMUL model to the farmers and motivate
them to join the DCS.
(d) A marketing expert to advise on optimization of production
schedules and marketing strategy within the context of five
dairy plants.
(e) A fodder/livestock expert to select about 50 farms owned by
progressive farmers and set them up for demonstration pur-
poses, in applied animal husbandry and milking hygiene and
incorporating permanent pasture/fodder crops grown exclusive-
ly for milk production.



- 13 -
4.15      Assurances were given by GOI and GOR that these consultants,
acceptable to IDA, would be recruited for RDDC; for consultants' terms of
reference see Annex 6.
4.16      Establishment and operation of five Union Training Centers (UTC)
with training equipment and staff would be financed under the Project. Each
center would provide about 1,000 man months of training annually during
formation of the DCS. Trainees would range from dairy farmers to DCS and
Union staff and Board members. Course content would relate to the AMUL model,
and in the case of DCS trainees would involve AI, milk testing and basic
record keeping, and cooperative principles. The project also provides for
intensive extension effort during the development phase involving some 50
village extension workers (VEW) per union. The VEW would assist producers
in the application of basic principles of animal husbandry, milking hygiene,
feeding, fodder production and mixed farm management as directed by the
fodder/livestock consultant and practiced on the demonstration farms. The
VEW and UTC instructors, along with key union staff, and spearhead teams would
be trained by NDDB and the National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI). Overseas
fellowships for three key staff of each union would also be provided. Assur-
ances were given that project funds for training and extension would be
channeled to the unions, quarterly, through RDDC. Training and Extension
programs are in Annex 6; timing and duration of training and extension
activities are in Annex 6 Chart 1.
4.17      The animal health services to be furnished to the DCS by the unions
include a mobile veterinary unit for every 35 societies involving a vehicle
equipped with animal health and vaccination kits and staffed by a veterinarian
and trained assistant which would visit the DCS weekly without charge. Emer-
gency service would be available on call, at all times, to members free of
charge, and to nonmembers for a fee.

5.01      Estimates are based on mid-1974 prices.  Establishment costs during
development are initial operating losses and working capital. A physical
contingency of 10% has been applied to DCS investments to allow for the failure
of some DCS, although the equipment would be recovered. A 10% physical con-
tingency has been applied to all milk plant and feed mill investments to
account for unforeseen building and equipment corresponding to final plant
product mix. A 5% physical contingency has been applied to investments in
PRDC, BVVI and DLAB.  No physical contingencies are needed for establishment
costs, training and extension and the calf rearing grant. Price contingencies
have been applied to all items, except the calf rearing grant, on the following
assumptions: for civil works, 9% for the second half of 1974, 15% in 1975 and
12% thereafter to 1980; for equipment and local cost expenditures, 7% for the
second half of 1974, 11% in 1975 and 7.5% thereafter to 1980.

- 16 -
5.02      The proposed IDA credit of US$27.7 M would be to GOI and would
finance about 53% of the project costs. IDA financing would cover all foreign
exchange expenditures (US$12.7 M) and about 38% of local costs. IDA funds
for BVVI and DLAB support programs, the purchase of imported cattle, DCS
equipment and for training and extension services would be channelled by GOI
to RDDC through GOR (US$5.4 M). All other IDA funds (US$22.3 H) would be
channelled through ARC and participating banks, to RDDC and the unions under
subsidiary loan agreements satisfactory to IDA. Project lending terms and
conditions are detailed in Annex 2, Appendix 1. Details of the financing
plan are shown in Annex 7, Table 2.
5.03      GOI-GOR contributions (US$18.25 M) would finance about 35% of pro-
ject costs. They would cover theZ equity financing for investments (US$6.8 M)
of the institutions set up under the project and provide the necessary start-
up costs (US$4.6 M) to cover the expected deficits over the first four years
of operations. In addition, GOI--GOR would provide funds for BVVI and DLAB
(US$0.75 H), support training and extension (US$0.9 M) and subsidize the sale
of calf rations for rearing of thie first crossbred calves (US$5.0 M) and
provide for local cost financing of technical services and imported cattle
(US$0.25 M). ARC and participating banks would contribute US$5.6 M, about
11% of project costs, for financing investments and working capital of RDDC
and the unions. Farmers' contribution to the project is estimated at US$0.25
M, their minimum capital subscription to become DCS members. Assurances
regarding GOI. GOR. ARC and participating banks financing commitments were
given at negotiations. During nEgotiations, GOR demonstrated that substantial
progress had been made on a pre-project training program recommended by IDA,
for project personnel. Completicn of this program prior to project commence-
ment would be essential and IDA financing for such expenditures from June 1974,
subject to a maximum of $50,000, would be provided.
C. Procurement
5.04      RDDC would be the sole procurement agent for all RDDC and Union
investment items financed by IDA. Procurement for BVVI and DLAB items would
be through normal GOR channels. All major equipment (Annex 4) for the five
milk-processing plants and feedmills US$18.2 M) would be bulked in accordance
with phased construction and expansions (Annex 4 Table 4) and subject to
international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA Guidelines. Suitable
assurances were given by GOI. As most leading manufacturers of the equipment
are well represented in India and are competitive, tenders would be advertised
locally, and the representatives of potential supplier countries informed.
Locally manufactured equipment would be allowed a 15% preference or the
prevailing customs duty, whichever is lower. Appropriate assurances were
given. Consultants services (US$ 0.7 M) would also be procured according to
IDA guidelines. Minor equipment, items for the plants such as electrical
components, equipment fittings, arLd furniture (US$8.5 M) would not be amenable
to bulking and would be purchased over six years as phasing requires. Since
ready availability of service and spare parts is essential, these would be
purchased locally as needed from reputable suppliers.



- 17 -
5.05      As civil works for the construction of milk processing plants,
feedmills, BVVI, DLAB, RDDC and the unions, (US$9.4 M) would be dispersed
in time and place, they would each be too small to attract international
bidding and would be subject to local contracting by competitive tender.
5.06      Equipment for the DCS (US$0.7 M), and for RDDC and unions such as
farm machinery, irrigation equipment, breeding equipment, trucks, and vehicles
(about US$2.1 M) would be purchased following local competitive bidding, since
these items would be purchased in small quantities over the project period.
For procurement of imported bulls and dairy heifers for the RDDC breeding
farm and the unions' bull farms (US$0.2 M), assurances were given by
GOI that tenders would be called from at least three countries free from foot
and mouth disease where animals of the required breed, type, and adaptability
are available.
5.07      The equipment, chemicals and glassware for the DLAB and BVVI (about
US$1.4 M) would be procured following local competitive bidding because it
would be difficult to bulk orders. Most of the world's leading manufacturers
of scientific equipment are represented in India and they are competitive.
The local maintenance service offered by established representatives would
also be available to maintain the equipment to be purchased under the project.
Orders would be bulked to the extent possible. The remaining project costs
(US$11.6 M) would be for union and DCS establishment costs (initial operating
deficits), training and extension services, working capital and calf rearing
grant.
D. Disbursements
5.08      IDA disbursements are expected to extend over seven years (Annex
7 Table 5) and would be against appropriate documentation:
(a)  100% of cif expenditures, or of ex-factory costs, if locally
manufactured of milk and feed-processing equipment to be pro-
cured under ICB;
(b)  100% of cif expenditures for imported cattle and 100% of
the cost of consultant services and fellowships;
(c)  70% of expenditures for locally procured equipment and
civil works, including engineering;
(d)  80% of project expenditures on local training, union training
centers and extension program.



- 18 -
E. Accounts and Audit
5.09      Assurances were given that ARC would maintain project accounts,
audited by independent and qualified auditors, the audited accounts to be
submitted to IDA within four months after the close of each fiscal year.
Commercial firms audit the accounts of the commercial banks. Accounts of
cooperative institutions (LDB, RSCB, DCS and Unions) are audited by the
Department of Audit and Inspection under the Registrar of Cooperatives in a
manner satisfactory to IDA. However, AMUL experience has shown that a single
annual audit of DCS is insufficient. Efficient management of AMUL village
dairy cooperatives called for intensive and continuous audit service involv-
ing about 50 field inspectors from the State of Gujarat Cooperative Depart-
ment.  This service has been highly satisfactory and has proven to be a major
factor contributing to AMUL's siccess. Assurances were also given that the
GOR Department of Audit would: (a) audit the accounts of the unions, submitting
the audited accounts to IDA withiin six months of the end of each fiscal year;
(h) provide audit to each DCS, with at least one full audit and two book
supervisions per year; (c) strengthen its staff to carry out the above func-
tions; and also that RDDC would maintain audited project accounts, submitting
the audited accounts to IDA within six months after the end of each fiscal
year.
VI. ORGANIZAI'ION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Rajasthan Dairy Development Corporation
6.01      GOI and GOR would subscribe equally to all of RDDC's initial paid
up capital suitable assurances were given. As a condition of effectiveness,
(i) GOI and GOR would invest an initial equity capital of Rs 0.30 M each
(Annex 5 Table 3); and (ii) GOR would provide redeemable equity capital to
cover the first year's estimated startup costs (Rs 0.5 M). GOI and GOR would
also provide additional equity financing to ensure that RDDC qualifies to
borrow funds from participating banks for project investments, according to
criteria listed in Annex 2 Appendix 1. An assurance was also given that,
not later than year six (1980) of tie Project, both GOI and GOR would offer
for sale their shares in RDDC to the unions, at par value, until the unions
had attained at least 75% ownershlip.
6.02      RDDC would be established under articles acceptable to the Asso-
ciation and governed by a fifteen member board of directors (Annex 5). A
Managing Director with qualificat:ions and experience acceptable to IDA, would
carry out executive duties assisted by about five Divisional Managers (Annex 5
Clart 1).



- 19 -
B. Unions and Cooperatives
6.03      Each cooperative milk producer's union would have an eleven member
board of directors (Annex 4). Initial farmer representation would be six,
elected from among and by the chairmen of the affiliated DCS. Once the DCS
become majority shareholders (year eight-nine) they would acquire the right to
appoint the Chairman of the board. A ineral Manager appointed by the board
and approved by RDDC for the first year following establishment of the unions,
would be responsible for day-to-day management of the union and would also be
an exofficio board member.
6.04      GOI and GOR would finance as equity at least 20% of union invest-
ments (Rs 54 M), so as to maintain a suitable debt: equity ratio and to
ensure the unions' creditworthiness. GOR would also provide additional
redeemable equity capital to cover the unions' initial operating deficits
(Rs 31 1M). Assurances as to these financial commitments were given by GOR
and GOI. Under cooperative law DCS are required to allocate 25% of their
net income to a reserve fund and DCS bylaws (Annex 3) would require that 80%
of this reserve fund be held as union shares. With these funds, DCS would
buy out Government equity in the unions, expecting to become majority share-
holders by about year eight (1982), of the project. Assurances were given
by GOR and GOI would not later than in year six (1980) of the project and
each year thereafter, offer for sale their shares in the unions, at par value,
to individual DCS, until the DCS had attained at least 75% ownership. In
addition, assurance were given by GOR share capital subscriptions for initial
operating deficit, would be redeemed once the loans are repaid. Government
equity financing and its acquisition by the DCS is estimated in Annex 4,
Table 14. After debt service, paying dividends and bonuses to DCS, retained
earnings (estimated at about Rs 32 M by year ten) would be used for a further
stage of dairy and feed plant expansion.
The Village Dairy Cooperative Societies
6.05      The village dairy cooperative society (DCS) would be the basic
organization unit. Each would be normally managed by a committee of nine
members, elected for a three-year term. The committee would elect a chairman
and nominate a member to represent the cooperative and to stand for election
to the union board of directors. During the first year of operation the DCS
would be managed by a smaller 5 member committee. The committee would ap-
point a paid secretary who would be responsible for day-to-day operations.
There would also be one to four helpers to assist the secretary. All would
be trained in AI, emergency first aid and milk testing as well as in simple
bookkeeping, at the Union Training Center (Annex 6). They would be paid from
the revenues of the society derived from commission on milk sold to unions
and feed sold to members (Annex 3, Table 5).
6.06      Each DCS would be capitalized by share subscriptions by members
and entrance fees. For each newly formed DCS, GOR would grant the capital



- 20 -
equipment (Rs 2,000/DCS) and operating deficit in the first year (Rs 1,000/
DCS). Initial working capital needs would be financed by the shares sub-
scriptions. Total cost to GOR is estimated at Rs 5.5 MI for capital equipment
and initial operating deficit. Assurances were given that GOR would meet
this financial commitment. Similar grants are available elsewhere in India
where Government promotes producer cooperatives, including AMUL, and are
essential to bring about a rapid transformation in the rural institutional
framework that the AMUL model implies.
C. Project Implementation
6.07      The project has a defined scope and its implementation would be
planned with each step scheduled iD. a critical path fashion. The RDDC would
be set up immediately, all five unions within one year and the 1800 DCS would
be established progressively over a period of five years.
6.08      The project authority and center of coordination would be the RDDC.
This would be the seat of the hired consultants and other experienced execu-
tives (Divisional Managers) who would be coordinated by the Managing Director.
The Divisional Managers would each be responsible for carrying out a specific
phase of the project. This would be done by working through their respective
counterparts in the unions, who in turn would be responsible for the same
specific phase within their own union.
6.09      Major initial steps in ir.plementing the project would be to organize
the RDDC, recruit, train and appoint the executive staff of the RDDC, and the
five unions. In coordination with its respective RDDC Divisional Manager,
each union Divisional Manager would determine the workload of his Division,
the schedule, the staff required, including spearhead teams and arrange for
its recruitment and training. The participation of NDDB would be essential
in selecting and training staff ance. supervise spearhead teams and also in
assisting in the marketing study ar,d in the preparation of specifications
and evaluation of tenders for construction of the plants (Annex 4 Appendix 1).
D. Supporting Activities
Diagnostic Laboratory
6.10      A cross breeding health program would be instituted and coordinated
by the GOR Department of Animal Husbandry. The proposed diagnostic field
laboratory to be located in the prclject area would have an active partici-
pation in this program. The Laboraitory would be staffed and operated by GOR
in consultation with CVAS. It would also work in close collaboration with
the new BVVI. Assurances to this effect were given.



- 21 -
Biological Veterinary Vaccine Institute
6.11      The project would finance the construction of a plant principallv
for production of vaccines against rinderpest, hemorragic septicaemia, black-
quarter and anthrax. The Institute would function under the GOR Department
of Animal Husbandry. To ensure representation of the organizations involved
in animal disease control in Rajasthan, a board of management would be estab-
lished. It would be responsible for major policy matters including integration
of disease control programs with production of the appropriate vaccines. The
board would consist of the Secretary of Agriculture (chairman) with two repre-
sentatives each from the RDDC and the GOR, Department of Veterinary Services
and one from the University of Agriculture Science. It would appoint a
director who would be responsible for the management of the institute and
who would also be a board member, ex-officio.
6.12      Assurances were given that project funds for equipment for the DLAPJ
and BVVI (Rs 16 M) would be made available by GOR.  Fequests for suclh financing
under the project would be prepared each year by DLAB and BWVVI directors,
respectively, and approved by GOR and IDA. Assurances were also given by GOR
that the initial operating deficit of 1V'VI (Rs 1.1 N; Annex 7, Table 4) and
cost of operating DLAB would be financed by GOR.
E. Lending Operations
AIRC would invite all banks operating in the project area to parti-
cipate in the project. Based on eligibility criteria agreed to with IMA,
A}PC would determine the eligible bankos.  To ensure effectiveness and uniformity
of supervision the minimuml number of banks required to adequately servicc the
six subloans vould be selected by ARC in consultation with the unions and
RDI)C. ARC would provide at least 80% refinance for the banks' loans. Sub-
loansproposals, on behalf of the unions, would be prepared by RDDC in con-
sultation with NDDB and submitted to the participating banks.  The conditions
of effectiveness would be that (a) a subsidiary loan agreement between GOI
and ARC, approved by IDA, had been executed, (b) loan agreements, satis-
factory to IDA, between ARC and participating banks had been concluded.
6.14      Project lending terms and criteria are detailed in Annex 2 Appendix
1.  Unions and RDDC would payat least 11%0 per annum, the participating banks,
3S, and ARC, 7.5%. These rates are in line with the current rates in the
agriculture sector in India. nTe participating banks would be required to
operate a project supervision group, in consultation with ARC to continuously
monitor the progress of the project, submit quarterly reports and make recom-
mendations to the banks, ARC and IDA. The necessary assurances were given.
Funds for training and extension would not be refinanced through banks as
these would be a GOI-GOR grants.

VII. PRODUCTION, MAPRETING, PRICES, SUBSIDIES,
AND FINANCIAL RESULTS
Production
7.01      Initially producticn would be increased from existing native cattle
and buffalo by adoption of better management and feeding practices, but the
greatest increase would come from an intensive program of cross-breeding
native cattle with high producing exotic breeds. The first cross-bred cows
would come into production in year four increasing in significant numbers
thereafter (Annex 3). In year three of a DCS (full membership) milk collected
daily (cows and buffalo) would be about 110 1; in year five, 180 1; and in
year ten, 400 1. In year five the total daily increase in milk production
from present levels would be 290,000 1 and 1,400,000 1 in year ten.
Xarketing
7.02      Despite growth of t'e cities in the project area, after year six,
project milk production would be far in excess of the urban demand (about
350,000 1/day). Allowing for the private vendors who would supply about 20%
of the urban demand, the remaiLning 80%, supplied by the unions, would only
represent about one third of their production. The Union milk sold in the
cities, would be about 50% in bottles (1/2 1) and the balance in bulk form
sold at union owned booths and from vending machines installed in grocery
shops. The booths would also serve as outlet for union milk (chilled, raw)
during the first two years when plants are under construction. Another third
part of the production would be channeled into the National Milk Grid by
freighting to Delhi in bulk form in insulated rail cars. The balance of the
milk production would be converted into butter, ghee and skimmed powder, for
whic-l there is a ready market in big milk deficit centers like Delhi, Bombay,
Caicutta and MIadras.  Mlarketing and product mix assumptions are shown in
Annex 4, Table 10. The marketing study proposed under the project would
cstallish the optimal product mix for each plant, before construction.
Prices
7.03      Assurances were given by GOR that each union would be free to set
the sale price of its products, the procurement price of milk and charges for
services to members. The unions would supply wholesome milk at prices in
competition with the private producers and vendors. The average prices in
the urban markets would be expected to decline particularly during the lean
season when they are over Rs 2 per liter.  Following the AMUL model, village
producers would be paid according to butter fat content of their raw milk or
albout Rs 25/kg butter fat, a price higher than the average Rs 21/kg under
the traditional intermediary system. (Annex 3, Table 7). Village producers
would also increase their purchasing power for feed supplies and would re-
tain more of the fodder now sold to urban producers.



- 23 -
Grants, Subsidies and Cost Recovery
7.04      The present policy of Government dairies implies a subsidization
of consumer milk prices that would come to an end in the project area when
the unions determine prices in their members' interest. The only non-recover-
able expenditures under the Project are Government startup grants to the DCS
(training, extension and calf rearing), justified to facilitate the setup of
new cooperative organizations and the spread of proven crossbreeding technology
to rural areas. Loan components under the project are all recoverable at
commercial interest rates. Farm income and the sale of milk are not taxed,
but the Government would earn sales tax on processed milk products and income
taxes on RDDC and the unions.
7.05      To ensure the proper care of the early crossbred calves during the
critical first three months of their lives and to encourage the spread of
crossbreeding, GOI would subsidize the provision of calf starter rations for
their first crossbred female calf to members of the DCS up to a maximum of
Rs 200 per member. Assurances were given that the GOR Animal Husbandry Depart-
ment would administer the calf rearing subsidy program.
Financial Results
7.06      All institutions set up under the project would be financially
viable and would generate a satisfactory rate of return. DCS would earn
surpluses from year two onward. Financial rates of return at the unions'
overall activities would be about 18% (see Annex 4, Table 13). RDDC would
charge a yearly levy from each union to cover the cost of services starting
year five. The RDDC bull farm would be an independent profit center. Its
financial rate of return would be about 13,'. BVVI vaccine production would
also generate profits.  The typical smallholder in the project area now owns
one nondescript native cow, yielding about 500 1 of milk per lactation. Part
of this milk is consumed by the calf and the household, so that cash income
from the sale of surplus milk would seldom exceed Rs 100 per lactation. In
addition to providing for increased domestic consumption of milk, net cash
income from a crossbred cow would be about Rs 400 per year (Annex 3, Table 6).
As the smallholders in the project area are predominantly subsistence farmers,
dairying would be their main source of cash income and link to the money
economy.
7.07      In addition, the project would afford small farmers the opportunity
to adopt a mixed farming system through the integration of a profitable live-
stock enterprise (commercial dairying) into their traditional cropping system.
Since such a change would involve the introduction of pasture/fodder crop
rotation, it would result in long-term improvement in soil structure and ferti-
lity which would largely compensate for some diversion of land to fodder.

VIII. ECONOMIC COSTS, BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATIONS
8.01      The direct economic benefit of the project would be the increased
production of milk. The incremental annual milk production is estimated
at 475,000 tons by year ten. Although ample markets would exist, potential
increase in milk production after year ten has not been taken into account
because additional processing capacity required then is not included in the
project investments.
8.02      The project would directly benefit, through increased incomes, about
240,000 agricultural households most of whom farmless than 2 ha (15% landless),
or approximately 1.3 million people, which is about 20% of the rural popula-
tion in the project area.  The establishment of 1,800 DCS, five milk unions
with their own milk plants and feed mills would provide direct employment for
about 8,000 people. It would also support a milk transport service of about
100 vehicles mostly owner operated.
8.03      Social benefits would be derived after the village DCS become
firmly established with a regular surplus of funds (estirated at Rs 12,000
annually by year eight). These funds would most likely be used to augment
or initiate village development schemes such as education, health, family
planning, minor public works and infrastructure (AMUL model). A further
benefit would accrue from improvred nutrition due to increased intake of milk,
particularly by children and infants. The benefits to the consumers would
also come from an improvement ini nutrition due to increased availability of
unadulterated pasturized milk in the urban areas. Also, as the share of
hygienic pasturized milk to raw milk increases, the risk of milk borne diseases
such as TB, Brucellosis and gastrointestinal infections (particularly with
infants) will decrease greatly.
8.04      The assumptions for computing the economic rate of return are in
Annex 8. Labor costs for feed and green fodder production are included
at their market price. Skilled and semi-skilled labor for milk plants and
feed mill operations is costed at market price. Incremental family labor
requirements for twice daily milking of crossbreds as opposed to native cows
are minimal (about 10 minutes/day) and would not affect alternative employ-
ment and are thus not considered significant. Milk is valued at Rs 1.50/1
which is a composite price of ex-plant fluid milk and the portion of the farm
production that would bypass the plants. This price is at the lower end of
the price range in urban markets. Based on these costs and benefits assump-
tions, the estimated economic rate of return is 31%.
8.05      The most significant risk facing the project is the task of creating
DCS and unions to establish a new cooperative controlled production and mar-
keting channel for the increased amount of rurally produced milk. NDDB's
experience in replicating the AM1iL pattern in Gujarat and other parts of the
country indicates that human responses to such a program are varied but that
the obstacles, though many, are surmountable. Intensive training, extension



- 25 -
and organizational support are essential in replicating the AMUL model and
the project places considerable emphasis on these inputs. A sensitivity
analysis to test the effect of higher costs and lower benefits on the estimated
rate of return was carried out. If investment and operating costs are 10%
higher while the benefits due to delays in farmer response or decreased pro-
duction are 10% lower, the economic rate of return is estimated to drop to
22%. A sensitivity analysis to test the effect of slower formation of
successful DCS, assuming that plant investments are not delayed, shows that
if successful DCS can only be formed at half the rate envisaged, the expected
rate of return would still be 24%.
IX. RECONMENDATIONS AND AGREEMENTS REACHED
9.01      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following major
points:
With GOI that:
(a) All major equipment of the milk processing and feed mill
facilities would be procured through international compe-
titive bidding, in accordance with IDA guidelines.
Locally manufactured equipment would be allowed a 15%
preference or the prevailing customs duty, whichever is
lower (5.04);
(d) Exotic dairy heifers, bulls and frozen semen would be pro-
cured on the basis of quotations requested from at least
three countries free from foot and mouth disease where
animals suitable to the project are available (5.06);
With GOI and GOR that:
(c) Consultants acceptable to IDA would be recruited by RDDC
to assist the unions in the following activities: dairy
plant engineering, milk and dairy products marketing,
dairy processing engineering, mass-media communication
expertise, and forage/animal production (4.14);
(d) nTey would, for the first time not later than 1980, and each
year thereafter, offer for sale their shares (i) in RDDC to
the unions at par value until the unions had attained at
least 75% ownership (6.01); and (ii) in the unions to the
individual DCS, at par value until the DCSs had attained at
least 75% ownership (6.04);



-. 26 -
(e) They would provide equity financing required to ensure
that the RDDC and the Unions quality for project loans
from participating banks (6.04);
With GOR that:
(f)  The DCS and the unions would be formed under bylaws
acceptable to IDA (4.05) and existing societies and
unions would be eligible to participate only after
the capitalization, bylaws and management had been
approved by IDA (4.05);
(g) It would finance the start-up costs and initial operating
deficits of the DCS, unions, and RDDC; such financing for
the unions and RDDC would be in the form of redeemable
share capital, to be redeemed once the loans from banks
are repaid (6.04);
(h) Each union would be free to set prices for its products and
services, and for milk procurement from members (7.03).
With ARC that it would:
(i) Invite all banks operating in the project area to determine
interest in participating, establish a list of eligible
banks based on criteria agreed to with IDA and lend through
the minimum number of banks selected in consultations with
the unions and RDDC (6.13); basic eligibility criteria for
cooperative banks would 1e that collection rate must be
above 6f5% and any amount required to reduce overdues as a
percentage of demand to 25%, to be financed by GOR by
purchase of redeemable equity; participating banks would
provide an adequate project supervision group to oversee
the project investments, submitting quarterly reports to
ARC and IDA (6.14).
9.02      It was agreed that the following would be conditions of credit
effectiveness:
(a)  RDDC had been established under the articles approved by IDA
and its Managing Director having qualification and experience
acceptable to IDA, appointed (4.03); and GOI and GOR
had contributed Rs 0.30 M each as share capital subscription
of RDDC and GOR had contributed an additional Rs 0.5 M as
redeemable share capital for the first year start-up costs
(6.01);
(b) RDDC had made arrangements satisfactory to IDA to (i) train
consultants, executive staff of RDDC and unions and spearhead
teams; (ii) provide first: year field supervision; (iii) furnish
consulting services for effecting a dairy marketing study; and



- 27 -
(iv) assist in preparing specifications for tenders for
procurement of equipment and construction of the dairy
plants and feed mills (4.03);
(c) RDDC had recruited three consultants (Dairy plant
engineer, mass media communications specialist, and
livestock/forage specialist), and the RDDC divisional
managers of institutional development, livestock development
and engineering.
(d)  A subsidiary loan agreement between GOI and ARC had been
approved by IDA and executed.
(e)  Loan agreements, satisfactory to IDA, had been concluded
between ARC and participating banks.
9.03      Given the above assurances and conditions, the project is suitable
for an IDA credit of US$27.7 M.

RAJASTHAN DAIRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The Dairy Sub-Sector
A. Background
General
1.        Annex 1 of Report NP:  431-IN of Karnataka Dairy Development Project
contains a comprehensive review of the Dairy Sub-sector in India in general.
Agriculture
2.        About 73% of the Rajasthan population is engaged in agriculture
which contributes about 40% of state income. Approximately 13 million ha
(37%) of the state are desert. Forests cover 1 million ha (3%) and, 11.5 mil-
lion ha (40%) are under rainfed crops mainly millet, Jowar(sorghum)and
maize. About 2.5 million ha (18%) is irrigated. Irrigated crops include
wheat, paddy, cotton, sugarcane, millet, pulses, oilseeds, fodder crops
(alfalfa and berseem), fruit and vegetables. The annual rate of agricul-
tural growth during 1962/63 to 1970/71 was 2.8%. The average holding is
6.8 ha.
3.        The production of foodgrains in Rajasthan in 1971-72 was as
follows:

4.        Average production of foodgrain per capita is 270 kg/year comDaring
favorably witlh 190 kg/year for all of India.  This agricultural Droduction
comes mostly from western Mad"hya Pradesh where the Project would be located.
B.  Daisy Livestock
Livestock and Breeds
5.        The present bovine nopulation of t4adhya Pradesh is about 26 million
cattle and 6 million buffalo.  This represents 15% and 11% respectively of
the Indian total. Some 8.1 million cattle and 2.5 million buffalo above 3
vears of age are breedable milkin7 stock.  Only about 50% of these females
are in milk.  'lost animuals do not conform to any specific breed, the following
breeds can be identified:  cattle:  Malwi, llariana, Gaolao, Nimari, Cir and
Kankathar. The prevalent buffalo breed is the ?'rurrah for milk production,
also the Bhadawi.
6.        There are seven government cattle breec7ing farms in the state nro--
ducing pedigree bulls of the main breeds, but only one maintains Jersey bulls.
Until 1970 the cattle breeding policy in the state was to upgrade the local
cattle wqith hullls of the dominant breeds in the state. Y-Towever because of
the slow rate of genetic improvement throtugh selection and the relatively low
potential for milk production of the indigenous milking breeds of cattle, it
is now pronosed to introduce exotic breeds of dairy cattle to upgrade local
cattle to a level of 2/3 exotic blood.
7.        It is only in the last two vears that exotic purebred breeding of
dairy cattle have been introdulced into the state for the purpose of producing
bulls for crossbreeding with the indigenous cattle.  This will be the breeding
method used in the nroject for improving milk production.  The Jersey breed,
because of its high fat content. low maintenance requirements (small nature
body size), and7 availahlitv of high quality stock, ¶3oulr he the oreferred
cross.  However other exotic breeds are lhein( tested under controlled condi-
tLons suchi ts the Broi^m Sxyiss under th-e Inlo1 Swiss Breeding Project (Kerala)
and the Red Dane under the Danish'  oject Assistance Program  (Karnataka).
'lanagement of exotic stoclk and cro3sbreeding in India requires close super-
vision. Some important features are:
(a)  it takes two to three veirs to acclirmtize exotic animals-
(b)  ever after suich acclimatization the exotic population does not
normallv reach the production  level which could be exnected
in its home countrv
(c)  it takes time for local rianagement to adapt to the requirements
of the exotic breecls and their cross breds-



ANNEX 1
Page 3
(d) crossbred heifers show a much earlier maturity than their native
mother but in mating, consideration must be given to their lower
body weight and measurements as compared with the exotic animals;
(e) under Indian conditions the optimum proportion of exotic blood is
about 2/3. The Indo-Swiss Project is aiming at a 50% dual
purpose (dairy and draught) crossbred where the indigenous
parental stock is a crossbred between Hariana (dairy and
draught) and Sahiwal (dairy) breeds;
(f) an improved animal can express its higher production potential
only under adequate management and feeding.
Milk Production
8.        Indian native cattle and buffalo mature late, calving for the first
time around four years of age, with an intercalving period of two years (50%
calving) and have low milk production. Cows in milk average 1-1/2 1. per day
(500 1. per lactation) and buffalo around 2.5 1. per day (800 1. per lactation).
First cross project heifers by Jersey bulls are capable of producing about
2,300 1 per lactation.
9.        The following selected data show the milk yields of crossbreds
compared with their indigenous dams:

C. Feed Requirements
Feeds and Feeding
10.       The most common cattle feeds available are:  byproducts of agricultural
crops: straw, sugarcane tips; cultivated fodders: alfalfa, berseem (clover) and
hybrid napier; perennial pasture grasses; concentrates from rainfed crops:
barley, cottonseed, gram (chickpea); and oilcake from groundnut, sesame, rape,
cottonseed. The low quality crop residues which comprise the main roughage
component of the native animal's diet are inadequate to maintain crossbreds.
Therefore increased dairy herds and milk production (Annex 3) under the
Project would depend on an adequate supply of high quality forage and balanced
premixed feed. GOR measures to encourage fodder production include demonstra-
tion farms for improved pastures and better management, seed multiplication
farms, distribution of hybrid napier seedlings, loans and grants for pasture
improvement and for fencing of pasture land, and subsidies for fodder seed and
chaff-cutters. However the largest scope for increased production of high
quality forage is by intergration of fodder crops into existing irrigated
farms.
11.       The comparatively high agricultural production in eastern Rajasthan,
where the Project area would be located, would assure the supply of the food
grain ingredient (25%) and the agricultural byproducts (75%) of the balanced
concentrate feed. In view of the need of increased supplies of milk for better
human nutrition, together with the social impact dairy development has for
small farmers, the trade off between increased milk production and a greater
demand for cereal grains is readily accepted by government, particularly as
milk constitutes an important source of protein for the large vegetarian segment
of the population.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
Incremental Feed Demand Under the Project:
12.       Indigenous cattle currently consume about 3 tons of straw, 3 tons
of green fodder, and 0.5 tons of concentrates during the year of lactation
(500 1 every second year). Crossbred cattle when seasonally well managed
require an additional 4 tons of green fodder and 1 ton of concentrate mix
in a year for producing about 2,300 1 per lactation. The replacement of
indigenous cows by crossbred stock in each DCS is also projected to increase
its member cow herd size from 210 AU to about 260 AU at maturity. Allowing
for the phased implementation of the 1,800 DCS over five years and increased
membership in each DCS during the first three years, the total numbers of
crossbred cows, in year ten, would be about 170,000.
The total additional feed requirements, by year ten would then be:
Green fodder:
(a)  for crossbreds:  170,000 X 4              680,000 tons
(b) for increased milk production
of buffalo and indigenous cows:
100 million liters X 2 ton/1,000 1        200,000 tons
Total                               880,000 tons
at a yield of 50 tons/ha/year this would require about 20,000 ha of irrigated
land and approximately 30,000 dug wells.
Premixed feed:
(a)  for crossbreds:  170,000 X 1              170,000 tons
(b) for increased milk production
of buffalo and indigenous cows:
100 million liters X 0.5 ton/1,000 1    50,000 tons
Total                               220,000 tons
The additional requirements of premixed feed would involve about 55,000 tons
(25%) of cereal grain or about 0.9% of Rajasthan's total present grain
production.
13.       There are at present about 280,000 wells in the six districts of the
Project and about 25% (70,000) would belong to farmers expected to join the
DCS. As only about 10% have access to electric power for pumps, a dug well of
about 20 ft in diameter and 80 ft deep can only irrigate 0.6 ha extracting the
water with bullock power. The presently irrigated area to come under the
Project would thus be about 40,000 ha. This area would appear ample for fodder
production, however about 15,000 additional wells would to dug (over a ten
year period) allowing for members with irrigated land who would continue growing



ANNEX 1
Page 6
other crops. Ground water is available, and also on-farm credit to farmers,
through ARC, for minor irrigation schemes involving wells. Advised by the
proposed extension services under the Project, farmers with irrigated land
would be encouraged to grow fodder for their own use and also for sale to
other members. Under present conditions, production of berseem and alfalfa
renders a net income to the farmer comparable to wheat on irrigated land. In
addition, and most important, long term improvement in soil structure and
fertility through introduction of leguminous fodders into the crop rotation
would increase yields of other crops grown on the irrigated land.
D. Milk Production and Marketing
Milk Producers
14.       Dairying in Rajasthan is largely a subsidiary activity to crop farm-
ing though in many instances it provides a daily cash income. Over 80% of the
cows and buffalo are kept in villatges. The average size herd is 2 - 3 breed-
able head per family. Milk producers are of 3 categories: (a) the landless
who represent about 15% of the rural population, keep 1 to 2 animals and
purchase all feeds and fodders; (b) the mixed farmer (cropping and livestock)
whose main income is from sale of crops surplus to household needs, dairying
is a sideline which utilizes crop byproducts. He may use a small area of his
land for growing fodder (alfalfa and berseem) purchasing small amounts of
concentrate, herd size is about 2 to 5 animals (c) the urban milk producer
with herds up to 20 head, he purchases all the feed and fodder and buys the
cows at peak production selling thiem when dry. In west Rajasthan nomads keep
herds of up to 200 head. Total milk production in the State is about 5,000,000
1/day equivalent to abqut 190 gr/capita, well above the national average of
110/115.
Dairy Cooperatives
15.       The Dairy Cooperative movement in the Project area came into existence
with the creation of the government milk schemes to assure supply for their
processing plants. Due to the subsidized milk price policy of the government
dairies and other organizational shortcomings, the cooperative movement did
not develop. As a result, in 1972, the Animal Husbandry Department commenced
the implementation of dairy cooperative societies, based on the AMUL model,
formed under two Unigns: Ajmer and Alwar, which would come into the project.
Milk Marketing
16.       The urban centers are the natural markets for village surplus milk
and in Rajasthan as in most of India there are three main type of suppliers of
milk to the urban markets: (i) traditional village agents, (ii) city producers;
(iii) cooperative sector. The traditional village agent, acting as a collector/
middleman for private vendors in the cities is still the main supplier. The
supply from city producers is also significant representing about 20% - 30% of



AN2NEX 1
Page 7
the urban demand. Villages that are remote from main roads and urban centers,
due to lack of adequate transportation, are compelled to convert most of their
milk into ghee (butteroil) wasting some of the skimmed milk. Only about 40%
of the milk is consumed as fluid.
17.       Most agent/collectors pay the village producer between Rs 1 - and
1.50/1, they operate from villages comparatively close to the urban centers.
Though offering a poorer product, they are serious competitors to organized
milk schemes which have to bear the higher cost of processing. Under the
present marketing system, the city producer selling direct to a regular con-
sumer clientele is also very competitive with the agent/collector even though
the city producer must buy all his feed supply. To reduce feed costs many
city producers purchase cows in milk and sell them at the end of their lacta-
tion, they do not, therefore, generally rear calves. Rajasthan has an unde-
veloped dairy processing and marketing structure resulting in severe milk short-
age, with marked price escalation in the urban centers, during the lean season.
18.       Milk prices of private vendors in Rajasthan are not controlled and
the urban market price for raw milk varies according to type and season from
about Rs 1.50 to 2.0 per 1. The GOR dairies market pasteurized milk in 1/2
1 bottles at significantly lower prices: Rs 1.35 per 1 of 3% fat (Jaipur) and
this makes them unable to pay village producers a competitive price. This
results in low procurement volume and operating losses due to low throughput.
Accordingly the GOR milk scheme in the city of Jaipur accomodates only about
8% of the urban demand. In addition to the Jaipur plant which has a capacity
of 20,000 1/day, the following government owned plants are also located in the
project area: Ajmer of 30,000 1/day to be completed in 1974 and Alwar of 10,000
1/day. In Bharatpur there is a private milk powder plant of 40,000 1/day.
Milk reaches the processing plants, in 40 1 cans, by contract truckers while
at the village level agent/collectors often procure and transport it to collec-
tion points by bicycle or oxcart. These four plants represent a processing
capacity equivalent to 5% of the total present milk production in the Project
area which is about 2,000,000 1/day.
19.       During the 4th Five year plan construction was initiated on dairy
plants in the cities of Bikaner (Operation flood). Jodpur, Ajmer (Project
Area) and Kota and are now in the completion stage. Milk would be supplied
through dairy cooperative societies organized along the AMUL model with intro-
duction of crossbreeding. There are already eight milk producers Unions
registered in the state.
E. Technical Services
Veterinary Services
20.       Disease prevention and control measures in the state are the respon-
sibility of the Department of Veterinary Services and Animal Husbandry. The
Department employs over 1,000 Veterinary graduates. For the 26 districts the



ANNEX 1
Page 8
state has 342 Veterinary Hospitals, 144 AI centers over 50 Rural Veterinary
Dispensaries and 37 Mass Immunization and Mobile Veterinary Units. The
Mobile Veterinary Units' function is to control epidemics and carry out free
of charge routine vaccinations for rinderpest and to a lesser extent for
blackquarter and hemorragic septicaemia.
21.       Approximately one third of the facilities operated by the Department
of Animal Husbandry for animal health services are located in the Project area.
The existing diagnostic station located at Jaipur has insufficient facilities
and staff to provide an efficient back-up service for field veterinarians and
mobile veterinary units. A new central diagnostic laboratory (CVAS) would be
established under the Project.
Vaccine Production
22.       The present vaccine production facilities at Jaipur are very in-
adequate and production has been curtailed because of low quality standards.
A new vaccine production unit known as the Biological Veterinary Vaccine
Institute (BVWI) would be established under the Project at Jaipur. The new
laboratory would concentrate on vaccine production for the state's livestock
requirements. Vaccine production is of particular importance to the exotic
and crossbred animals who are more susceptible to the infectious diseases
that are endemic in the country. The vaccines of importance to the Project
are hamorragic septicaemia, blackquarter, anthrax and rinderpest. The capacity
would be about 5,000,000 doses per year. Those are offered without charge,
government bearing the cost. The proposed Institute would be the respon-
sibility of the State Veterinary Services and Animal Husbandry Department
but subject to quality control by the Indian Veterinary Research Institute.
National production of foot and mouth vaccine is currently being reorganized
with the establishment of regional production plants under the Danish Project
Assistance Program. At present Hoechst operates a small plant in Bombay of
a capacity of 500,000 doses/year. The FM vaccine would be sold at Rs 8/dose
which would include a 50% GOI subsidy.
Artificial Insemination
23.       Artificial insemination is effected with fresh semen through 144
AI centers in the state. Due to shortage of trained staff and poor communi-
cations and transport facilities only about 25% of the semen is actually
utilized. The following statistics on AI in the district of Jaipur confirm
the present trend to crossbreeding:
Year         Exotic Jersey      Hariana        Buffalo        Total
1970-71        5,662 (48%)         2,890          3,185        11,737
1971-72         7,446 (54%)        2,401          3,992        13,839
1972-73        6,712 (54%)         2,570          3,168        12,450



ANNEX 1
Page 9
24.       Frozen semen from exotic stock is imported under bilateral aid
programs (Swiss, Danish, Canadian, and others) in limited quantities and
used mostly for the bull breeding farms. Frozen semen gives low conception
rates (25%) with buffalo and this has precluded its use in the AMUL model
where AI services are done xith fresh semen delivered daily with the milk
collecting trucks. Conception rates at AMUL average 45%.
25.       The Danish Project Assistance Program has provided five frozen semen
banks, one is scheduled for installation at Bikaner. Each bank has a capacity
of 125,000 doses/year for distribution tlhrough 50 AI units. It can receive,
store and distribute frozen semen and includes a liquid N2 plant. An addi-
tional nine such units are under consideration for India under a US$40 M
grant by the Danish government. The first five units would operate on imported
supplies of frozen semen. The subsequent nine would include twenty exotic bulls
each.
F. Government Policies
26.       The policies followed by the GOR in the dairy subsector are essen-
tially those established by the GOI in its Five-year plans. Allocations for
the dairy subsector in the first three development plans were inadequate
causing Government to reconsider its policies in the Fourth and current Fifth
plan. Togethier with the objective of food grain self-sufficiency, livestock
development in India and in Rajasthan is now gaining importance as a means
to diversify agricultural production. Witlhin the livestock sector, dairy
development has been given greatest emphasis in GOI's Fifth plan since, de-
spite imiilk and milk products providing the primary source of animal protein
availability has fallen from 120 (1970) to 112 g (1973). GOI plans for dairy
development have been stimulated by the successful AMUL experience and in
the Fifth five-year Plan GOI is encouraging the AMUL model as the basic means
to increase milk production. In addition, animal production, health and AI
facilities are proposed to be improved at state level and more emphasis placed
of increasing crossbred cattle. GOI would provide a crossbred calf subsidy
of Rs 200 per head, in the form of pre-mixed calf feed, to encourage farmers
to adopt better feeding practices and so avoid losses of valuable crossbred
heifers due to malnutrition. The Fourth plan provides funds for the con-
struction of a total eight dairy plans in Rajasthan four of which are soon
to be commissioned.

RAJASTHAN D4IRY DEVELOPMFNT PROJECT
Project Lending Institutions
1.        IDA funds for loans to the RDDC and the Unions would be on-lent by
GOI, through the Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC). 1/ ARC is well
known to the Bank group, being the intermediary refinancing channel for 15
ongoing IBRD/IDA credit projects.
A. Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC)
2.        ARC was established in 1963 as a subsidiary of RBI to provide a
supplemental source of medium- and long-term finance for agricultural credit
institutions and to guide them toward a development-oriented approach in their
operations. In support of the latter objective, ARC sponsors orientation
and training programs for management and technical staff of financial insti-
tutions, helps strengthen the nanagement and financial operations of banks,
especially the land development banks and, with the expansion of its own
technical division, is increas[ngly assisting financing institutions in
appraising the economic and technical feasibility of development schemes as
well as their supervision.
3.        During its first ten years of operations, ARC disbursed Rs 2,190 '1
(US$274 M) against a total conmiitment of Rs 4,010 M (USS626 M). About 90%
of its refinance assistance has been for minor irrigation and land develop-
ment schemes. Other minor lending includes farm mechanization, plantation
and horticulture, poultry, fishery, dairy cattle, storage facilities and
market yards. About 90% of ARC's refinance and assistance so far has been
disbursed through Cooperative Land Development Banks, 5% through State Co-
operative Banks and 5% through commercial banks.
4.        The spread between ARC's borrowing and lending rates is sufficient
to meet expenses and after declaring dividends, it showed a profit of Rs 3.7
Mi (US$463,000) in 1973-74. ARC is in good financial condition, its equity
position is unimpaired by losses, and its assets in GOI securities and de-
bentures of land development baaks are guaranteed in principal and interest
by GOI and State Governments.
1/  Full details of ARC's organization and financial operations are given
in Annex 4 of the Uttar Pradesh Agricultural Credit Appraisal Report
No. 1071-IN, April 12, 1973.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
5.        ARC would be required under the Project to:
(a) establish participation criteria with IDA based
on conditions listed in Appendix 1, invite all
banks operating in the Project area to participate
in the Project; and make a list of eligible banks;
(b) channel funds through not more than two banks
selected by the borrowing Unions & RDDC from the list
of eligible banks, providing 90% refinance
for project loans by these banks; and
(c) chair and direct the operations of a Project
Supervision Group to be established by the
banks (Appendix 1).
B. Cooperative Banks
6.        There are two separate cooperative banking systems in Rajasthan--
the Cooperative Land Development Bank (LT)B) System which provides long-
term development credit--and the State Cooperative Bank System (RSCB) which
provides credit mostly for crop production.  However, these systems are
independent of each other, though both are supervised by the GOR Registrar
of Cooperatives.
Rajasthan State Cooperative Land Development Bank (LDB)
7.        The LDB System is a federation of 37 Primary Land Development
Banks (PLDB) with most districts having at least one PLDB. The LDB has its
headquarters in Jaipur and also five regional offices. Annual lending in-
creased from Rs 2.2 million in 1964-65 to almost 46.5 million in 1970-71
but fell to Rs 31.4 in 1971-72 due to poor collection and the consequent
shortage of lendable funds. The emphasis is on development, mainly irrigation
wells, pumpsets, tractors and implements and land preparation. At the end of
1972, 1/ LDB portfolio was:
1/ Based on LDB Annual Report for 1972.

25,950            172.6
Average loan Rs. 4,800
8.        Principal LBD sources of funds are paid up share capital, reserves
and debentures. PLDB's are required to hold 5% of their borrowings from LDB
as share capital. As of February 28, 1974, paid up share capital was Rs.
14.7 million, of which 37% belonged to GOR, 62% to the PLDB's and less than
1% to the Central Cooperative Banks (para. 6). Reserves were Rs. 1.4 million,
undistributed profits 5.2 million, and issued debentures Rs. 205 million.
Net earnings improved from Rs. 0.25 million in 1967-68 to Rs. 2.1 million
in 1971-72.
9.        Collection Performance of PLfTB's, and thus the LDB, is unsatis-
factory. The PLDB's overdues as a percentage of demand (arrears plus amounts
due that year) have, since 1969-;'0, been contintially above 40%, while that of
LDB have risen from 4% in 1969-70 to 48% as of December 1973. Of the PLT)B's,
only 9 reported overdues below 25%, which is the maximum Permissible for
participation under ongoing IDA credit projects in other states of India.
GOR would provide redeemable equity capital to make up for the difference
between the actual overdues and the 25% requirement for LDB to participate
in the Project. Other conditions for Project participation are given in
Annendix 1.
Rajasthan State Cooperative Bank (RSCB)
10.       The Rajasthen State Cooperative Bank (RSCB), established in 1953,
has a three-tier structure based on 11,000 primary cooperative societies
federated into 28 Central Cooperative Banks (CCB), one for each district.
About 7,700 of primary societies are agricultural while others are consumer,
marketing or small agro-industrial societies. Borrowing members hold share
capital (12-1/2% of borrowings) in the primary society in the CCB. Similarly,
a CCB must hold 8.5% of its borrowings from the RSCB as share capital.  GO0
and GOR provide substantial financial assitance as equity capital, by sub-
sidies, placing of long-term, interest-free or low interest deposits or bv

contribution to a stabilization fund for converting short-term uncollectibles
into medium-term credit. The financial position of the RSCB 1/ at the end
of FY 1973 was:
Assets                                        (Rs million)
Cash & short call deposits                        20.4
Investments                                       25.7
Loans & Advances                                 169.3
Other Assets                                       7.9
Total Assets                                223.3
Liabilities
Capital--Paid up                                  20.6
Reserves & Other Funds                            38.2
Deposits                                          47.3
Borrowings                                       110.6
Other Liabilities                                  6.6
Total Liabilities                           223.3
11.       The RSCB loan portfolio is about 67% of short-term loans and
cash credits (a form of revolving credit), 30% medium-term and a very small
amount of long-term loans for cooperative processing. Borrowings are almost
exclusively from the RBI which annually provides 40-50% of the funds of the
cooperative banking system.
12.       Profits improved from about Rs 1.0 M in 1965-66 to about 1.9 M in
1970-71 but have since declined to 1.2 M as a result of reduction in lending
operations associated with severe overdue problems since 1971. The ratio of
overdues to amounts outstanding for the CCB's and the RSCB is unsatisfactory.
Thus, at the end of 1973 overdues with the CCB's stood at 42% of demand with
two reporting as high as 93% but two below 25%. The RSCB's overdues, at
Rs 30.7 M against a loan portfolio of Rs 135 M in 1972, were about 56% of
demand.
13.       RSCB given its limited experience in financing long-term processing
investments of cooperatives would be invited to participate in the Project
provided conditions for participation listed in Appendix 1 were satisfied.
C. Commercial Banks
14.       Direct financing of agriculture by commercial banks is a recent
development, beginning primarily after the nationalization of major banks
in 1969. Government has attempted to set targets for the opening of new
1/   Based on RSCB annual report 1972-73.



ANNEX 2
Page 5
branches in rural areas. Performance to date has been modest with the
commercial banks slowly building up expertise for agricultural lending.
Loans to date have been for tractors and pumpsets, with crop loans and short-
term credit limited to individuals who have taken medium-term credit. Col-
lection record, in agricultural oeprations except for the specialized Agri-
cultural Development Branches, ADE, is believed to be generally similar to
that of cooperative banks.
15.       The most important commercial bank operating in Rajasthan is the
State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur (SBBJ), a subsidiary of the State Bank of
India, followed by the Bank of Baroda and the Punjab National Bank. SBBJ is
currently experimenting with two Agricultural Development Branches, one of
which is in the Project area at Alwar. Operating since January 1973, ADB
Alwar, had achieved the following results by March 1974:
Number of      Amounts
Purpose of Loan                             Loans        Rs million
Crop Loans                                   610           29.7
Wells                                        220            6.8
Tractors                                      65           14.1
Pumpse ts                                    140            4.2
Animals                                       45            1.2
1,080          56.0
16.       ADB's experience to date has been very encouraging as it has no
overdues. ADB management is in the hands of a well trained agricultural
graduate, supported by one technician. The field staff are charged with
filling bimonthly supervision reports on every account. Based on experience
to date, to be effective, an ADB should concentrate on a maximum geographical
area of about 20-30 mile radius. A total of 10 ADB's are to be set up in
Rajasthan by December 1974 and 10 additional ADB's are likely to be estab-
lished during the next two years in the Rajasthan Canal Command area under
an IDA Project.
17.       In summary, commercial banlks are financially sound and are
strengthening their agricultural staif capabilities to expand their role
in agriculture. However, they lack experience in long-term financing of
investments for processing plants and are reluctant to move into the cooper-
ative sector. Given the changed emphasis following nationalization, it is
expected that commercial banks would be keen to participate in the Project
for long-term lending to the cooperative sector for milk processing and
cattle feed plants. Conditions for participation are given in Appendix 1.
Considering the problems of overdues and management of the LDB and RSCB,
the participation of commercial banks would be critical to the implementation
of the Project. Assurances would be sought that GOI and ARC, GOR would
facilitate the participation of commercial banks in the Project and that GOI
and GOR would provide guarantees, if necessary, for their project loans to
the Unions and RDDC.

RAJASTHAN DAIRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The Dairy Cooperative Societies
The AMUL Story
1.        DCS and Unions under the project would be organized along the well
known and highly successful AMUL 1/ cooperatives operating in Gujarat. The
core of AMUL 's success was the organizing of thousands of small farmers, each
cultivating an average of three acres, into hundreds of village cooperative
milk producer societies which, in turn, were federated into a union known as
the Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers' Union Ltd., Anand. The term
"AMUL", an abbreviation for Anand Milk Union Ltd., in the Sanskrit language
means "priceless" and is used as the trade name for all milk products sold
by the Union.
2.        The Union was started in 1946 with two village milk producers'
societies. From a handful of producers in two village societies, producing
about 250 1 of milk daily, the AMUL system today is based on some 785
village cooperatives with total membership of 225,000 individual milk pro-
ducers, all affiliated with the Union, which is now collecting about 150
million liters annually.
3.        Several unique features contributing to the success of the AMUL
pattern stand out. Its development was based on self-help; its leadership
grew while overcoming strong resistance from vested private interests. AMUL
is unique in its ability to provide numerous economic and social benefits to
thousands of small farmers. Some of the more signifeant features include:
(a) technical services on animal husbandry and fodder programs; (b) avail-
ability of prompt veterinary health and AI services; (c) concentrate feed;
(d) seed and fodder seedlings: (e) training programs for men and women; (f)
continuous supervision of the village cooperatives and quarterly audit;
payment for milk based on butter fat content; (g) supply of startup equipment
for each new society.
The DCS Model
4.        The DCS model (Table 1) is built upon data for the "average village"
in the project area which includes 9,860 villages (30% of Rajasthan's total)
1/   Also see IBRD report on the Survey of Successful Experiences in assist-
ing the Smallholder Livestock Producer dated December 1973 by Dr. E.
McCauley (Consultant), and Annex 2 of the Karnataka Dairy Development
Project Report (431a-IN) of May 21, 1974.



ANNEX 3

having a population of about 6.5 million (about 30% of the State's rural
population). The Project is aimed at 3,600 villages, or approximately 60%
of those accessible. The area contains 1.0 million (about 40%) of the State's
breedable buffaloes and 1.3 million (about 30%) of its breedable cows. The
average village in the project area has a population of 670, constituting
about 120 households. Of these households, about 80% own breedable animals
and approximately 15% are agricultural laborers who own no land or insufficient
land to meet their subsistence requirements.
6.        The average DCS is projected to reach its maximum membership in
the third year, covering about 70% of the village households and about 70%
of the village breedable cattle. ]:n order to obtain the volume necessary
for viable operations, two average villages would be included in each DCS.
The project would consist of 1,800 DCS and at maturity, it would cover an
estimated 245,000 rural households, 260,000 breedable buffaloes and 320,000
breedable cows (see Table 1).
Milk Collection & Services
7.        DCS would collect milk twrice daily.  The collection point would be
a building in the society's home village rented by the DCS. Collections would
be handled on a first-come-first-served basis and samples for fat testing
would be taken from every batch of milk. The quantity delivered by each
member would be noted at the time cif delivery by the DCS secretary trained
in milk testing (Annex 6), in a pocket record book carried by each member.
The payment according to fat content would be determined and recorded, along
with the volume delivered, in society records. Milk would be brought to the
main collection center from sub-centers in outlying villages. At each col-
lection sub-center a DCS helper would take a sample of each member's delivery
and note the volume. These deliveries would be bulked and transported by
the DCS helper to the main collection center, where the samples would be
tested and entries made in the DCS records. DCS staff would be trained (Annex
6) to provide AI and animal first aid services. Village extension workers
would provide technical assistance in crossbreeding and fodder production
through twice monthly contact with DCS members.
Payment
8.        Payment would be based on quantity and fat content.  Payouts would
be made at regular, frequent intervals as specified by a majority vote of
the membership. DCS bylaws would not allow payments to be made less fre-
quently than once a week. Daily payments would be recommended. Prices
would have to be established in competition with the village traditional
agent/collector and improved on to attract producers to the DCS. Bylaws
(Appendix 1) would permit price differential between members and non-members
for milk as well as feed. This would be in addition to the bonus of
Rs. 0.05/liter the DCS members would receive starting year 5.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
Transportation
9.        DCS milk would be bulked in 40 liter cans and transported from the
DCS's collection center initially by union owned trucks, later expanding with
private contractors, engaged by the Unions. Each contractor would be required
to provide tangible security which could be realized by the Union in the event
of breach of contract, which would follow the AMIUL format.  The maximum time
between the first pickup on a route and the time of delivery of milk to the
dairy plant or chilling center would not exceed 4.5 hours.  Any spoilage of
milk would be for the contractor's account.  At the dairy plant or chilling
center each DCS batch delivered would be sampled and tested for fat content
and SNF (solids-non-fat) and the DCS would be paid according to volume, SNF
and fat content.  Union payments for milk to DCS would be made every other
day for the first five years. Payments made in cash would be delivered by
the transport contractor, or else by depositing in the DCS account at the
nearest bank.
Investments and Financial Operations
10.       The physical investment for a DCS would consist of milk collection
and testing equipment, an AI crate, veterinary first aid equipment and some
furniture. Table 4 shows the projected investment requirements of a typical
I)CS and the total for the 1800 DCS to be formed under the Project. Table 2
shows the projections for milk collection and financial operations of a
typical DCS.  Suppliers hlio are not DCS members would be charged extra com-
mission. The initial year's loss would be covered by Government financing
the salary of staff for four months including two months in training. Equip-
ment would be provided. Working capital needs would be minimal as the Unions
would pay the DCS every other day for its milk (DCS would pay the members
daily). These requirements would initially be financed from membership fee
and share capital and further increases, as the volume expands, would be
financed from surpluses. Application of annual surplus would be governed
by the bylaws, with the first 25% applied to a reserve fund, 80% of which
would be held in Union shares. The typical DCS would be able to declare a
small patronage bonus of about 1 p/lit in year 2 increasing to 5 p/lit by
year 5. At the same time a DCS would be able to purchase, in addition to
one share required to become a Union member, additional shares worth Rs. 700
in year 2, rising to Rs. 3,100 by year 5, out of the funds allocated to
Reserves. By year 10, a DCS is expected to have a Reserve Fund of Rs. 83,000
of which Rs. 30,000 would be in the form of Union shares, Rs. 8,000 as working
capital and the balance available for other allocations, including village
development, according to membership decisions.
Accounts and Auditing
11.       DCS accounts would be maintained by the society secretary, who
would also supervise milk collection, record members' deliveries and compute
payments and disburse payments due each miember.  DCS secretaries would be



ANNEX 3
Page 4
trained in basic record keeping and other functions at the UTC (Annex 6).
Field managerial assistance would also be available to new DCS from the Union's
division of institutional development. The accounts of each DCS would be
audited at least every four months by the audit staff of the Registrar of
Cooperatives or the Union's supervisor. Results of each audit would be
communicated to the appropriate Union. The financial position of the DCS
would be communicated to members, along with the auditor's report, at the
annual meeting. Any significant irregularities would be reported by the
Registrar of Cooperatives to a special membership meeting.   DCS would not
be charged for audits for the first three years but thereafter, would be
charged according to a schedule of fees to be specified by the Registrar of
Cooperatives.

Z/ Incremental income per cow is aboutl Rs 340/year as a result of replacement through
AI. Most producers currently receive about Rs 0.80/1 for milk, partly in the form
of ghee. Based on this price, the gross margin for native cows would be about
Rs 70/cow/year. DCS would pay the higher price.

RAJASTHAN DAIRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Dairy Cooperative Union
A. Functions
1.        Under the Project, the DCS in each district (milkshed) would be
federated into a Union, established according to the State Cooperative law.
Once 25 DCS had been formed and operating in a district, a Union would be
formally registered. At full development there would be about 360 DCS in
each Union. The Union, like DCS, would be a farmer service organization
providing the following services: AI, animal health, cattle feed produc-
tion, milk collection, processing and marketing, institutional development
and technical extension services in fodder production and mixed farm
management.
Artificial Insemination Service--Bull Farm
2.        The Union would make a daily delivery of fresh semen to each DCS.
Each Union would invest in and operate a bull farm to produce fresh semen
from Jersey and Buffalo males, for AI service in the village. Trucks leaving
for milk pickup would collect iced semen packs for delivery to the DCS. The
DCS secretary and helpers would be trained at the Union Training Center to
provide Al services (Annex 6).
Animal Health Service
3.        For each route covering about 35 DCS's the Union would operate a
mobile unit with vaccination and animal health kits and staffed by a
qualified veterinarian and helper to provide routine veterinary services to
the DCS. Each society would be visited once weekly on fixed days and at
a fixed time. There would be no charge for such routine visits. However,
emergency 24-hour service which would also be available, would cost a member
Rs 15 per visit, and a non-member Rs 20. A total of 75 mobile units (30
Union owned and others hired) by year five would be equipped to provide
routine health services, pregnancy diagnosis, and vaccinations. A union
would not operate a veterinary hospital as this service is available from
the Government hospitals in the Project area.
Milk Collection and Processing
4.        Milk would be collected from the DCS along defined and economically
viable routes involving about 13-15 DCS each. Milk in 40 1 cans from the



ANNEX 4
Page 2
DCS would be picked up daily and transported to the dairy plants by a fleet
of both owned and hired trucks operated by the Union; 15 chilling centers
would be provided for pooling milk from distant routes services by five
13,000 1 capacity road tankers for freighting the milk to the plants. Pro-
cessing plants are discussed in Appendix 1.
Institutional Development and Technical Extension Services
5.        A Union Training Center (UTC) would be operated to cater to the
training needs of the DCS staff, members of the DCS Management Committee DCS
farmer membership as well as to Union staff. UTC investment estimates and
a description of the various training programs to be organized are given in
Annex 6. A total of 1,100 man months of training is expected to be provided
by the UTC annually. Management and organizational support to the DCS would
be provided by the Union, through frequent supervisory visits, by supervisory
staff from the Institutional Development Division. Extension needs of the
DCS would be considerable, especially during the early years. Union's ex-
tension services, described in Annex 6, provide for one full time village
extension worker during the first three months of a DCS operation, and sub-
sequently, once fortnightly supervision visits by the extension staff. Cross-
breeding, calf rearing, animal health, milking hygiene, feeding, fodder
production and mixed farming management would be the main subjects. Practical
demonstrations would be provided through the operation of about 10 demonstra-
tion farms by each Union. These farms of 2 ha. size would be operated by
their owners,under close supervision of the Union and the RDDC livestock/fodder
consultant, and would be guaranteed adequate incomes in order to encourage
their participation in the program.
Financial Operations
7.        Equity capital to enable a Union to borrow for investments in fixed
assets would initially come almost totally from Government, except for funds
resulting from the share purchases required from each member DCS. Lending
institutions would finance up to 80% of the cost of investments in milk plants,
feed mills, technical services and administration. Operating deficits (See
Table 13) would be small in the first two years and are expected to increase
in year three when the nilk plant comes into operation, all on account of
small milk volume. Operating surpluses are expected from year five when the
milk from the crossbreeds starts to increase. Operating deficits, including
feed mill operations, are expected to total Rs 3.8 M over years one to three.
These would be financed by equity-capital subscriptions by Government to be
redeemed at par in equal installments over years seven-nine.
8.        Union bylaws would require that 25% of the net income in each year
be automatically transferred to a Reserve Fund. Up to 80% of the balance
can be returned to the DCS as a patronage bonus effectively increasing the
members' selling price of milk. Cooperative Unions are assessed income tax
at 44%. Tax liabilities would be minimized by declaring the maximum permissible



ANNEX 4
Page 3
bonus while retaining sufficient funds for debt services and future expansions.
The unions are projected to reachi and, after tax and after bonus, rate of
return of about 13.5%. The rate of return including the bonus paid to DCS
would be 18%.
9.        Purchases by DCS of Government equity holding in the Unions are
shown in Table 14. By year nine, it is expected that DCS, applying 80% of
their Reserve Fund allocations for the purchase of Government shares in the
union, would have a 75% interest in the Union. Union's purchase of RDDC
shares would occur from the Reseive Fund allocations in year seven, enabling
the five unions to jointly own 75% of the RDDC paid-up capital. GOI and GOR
would hold the remaining 25%. By year ten, when a plant expansion may be
due, a union is expected to have reserves of Rs 32 M to enable it to raise
funds without Government involvemient.
D. Management and Bylaws
10.       Key requirements of the bylaws governing the Union operations are
summarized in Appendix 2. They provide for limited liability of members,
one vote per DCS, and the constitution of an 11 member board of directors.
The board, to be chaired during majority ownership by the district Collector,
would have the following representation: from member DCS, (6); GOR, (2);
RDDC, (1); and the Union's financing institution, (2). However, until a
Union has 80 DCS members, there would be only 1 DCS nominee on the Board.
Once the DCS have majority sharehAldings they would have the right to elect
the Chairman of the Board.
11.       Operational authority and responsibility would be vested in a
General Manager appointed by the board working through 5 divisional managers
responsible for Institutional Development, Livestock Development, Plant
Operations, Administration and Marketing (see Chart 1). The staff of the
union (Table 11) would expand frorm 100 in year one to about 430 in year five.
Union Division managers would work closely with the RDDC division managers
and consultants in planning and iriplementing their programs.

RAJASTHAN DAIRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Milk Processing Plants and Feed Mills
A. 14ilk Processing Plants
Milk Supply Projections-Plant Capacities
1.        The fluid milk available to the unions during the initial five
years of the project is comparatively small because the crossbreds from local
cows become productive only in the fourth year which is equivalent to year
nine for those societies implemented in year five. Table 4 shows the pro-
jected milk supplies to the Unions which have served to determine the capacities
of the proposed dairy plants. To reduce operational deficits during the
early years the dairy plants would be expanded to match the increased milk
supplies. The first expansion from 100,000 lts./day to 150,000 lts./day
would take place in year 4 and the second expansion to 200,000 lts./day in
year 6. As the project would not provide for disbursements beyond year 6,
throughputs and operating results have been based on this maximum capacity
which would be filled in year eight. The milk supplies expected to continue
increasing beyond year eight would be processed in new plants or further
plant expansions financed by new or other loans.
Urban M1arket Demand--Product Mix
2.        No adequate study has been made to deternine present and future
demand of milk and milk products of the urban markets in the Project area.
Consequently to determine plant equipment requirements a representative
and viable product mix, similar for all plants, was assumed.  This is
indicated in Table 10.
3.        As soon as NDDB had been contracted and the divisional managers of
marketing of the RDDC and Unions had been recruited, they would collaborate
with NDDB in making a market study involving the urban centers and the potential
demand of the regional and national milk grids, to determine the appropriate
product mix for each plant within the project context of five unions, to avoid
installing excess capacity in any one plant and to minimize freight of fluid
milk.
4.        General Design:  The successive expansion of the plants has been
planned to defer investment and improve cash flow. However, general layouts
and particularly building design from the very first phase of construction



ANNEX 4
Appendix I
Page 2
would allow for the subsequent expansions to assure a functional flow at all
times. Civil works, utilities, equipment and dairy processing equipment have
been detailed on the corresponding investment estimates (Table 1 and 2).
Effluent treatment would be of the secondary type either in the form of
trickling filter or anaerobic lagoons. Power would be purchased.
5.        All plants would include a milk drying plant for balancing purposes
and eventual production of infant food, a triblender for reconstitution of
milk during the lean season, and bottling facilities. For transportation of
milk from chilling centers to the plants and freighting surplus milk between
plants, one road tanker of a capacity of 13,000 liters would be provided for
each plant. Surplus milk to be diverted to the city of Delhi (National Milk
Grid) would go by rail utilizing Government rail tankers which would be
available.
6.        The Unions are only loosely identified with their respective dis-
tricts and milk routes would transverse the district borders as dictated by
the respective milksheds. Existing Government-owned chilling centers in the
region remaining in use would be incorporated as needed into the assets of
the respective Unions. In addition, the Project would provide for three chilling
centers for each Union for pooling milk from remote DCS.
B. Feed Mills
Balance Feed Demand
7.        This has been computed on the basis of a rate of 1 kg feed per
3 lt of milk, allowing for members that would not purchase feed. The milk
supply projections (Table 4) havre served to establish the yearly require-
ments of feed, as well as the peak capacities on a per day basis, for each
of the five plants.
Feed Mill Capacities and Constructions
8.        The feed mills would not undergo successive expansions but be built
in a phased manner each to its nominal capacity of 75 tons/day. Accordingly,
the first plant would be built in years one-two, the second in years two-
three and the last three in years four-five.
Feed Mill Operations
9.        Plants would have facilities for receiving raw materials in bulk
by truck and carry inventories for one month's production. Equipment would
be suitable for producing typical varieties of balanced feed formulas with
about 10 ingredients, sold in pellet form in 70 kg bags. To assure regular
supplied of feed to the DCS, each plant would be equipped with its own
fleet of trucks. Income and operating cost assumptions are shown on Tables
9-10.



ANNEX 4
Appendix 1
Page 3
C. Plant Construction
Engineering
10.       The NDDB has developed considerable capability and expertise in
dairy plant modular design and coordination of all phases of construction
with contractors. After having effected the recommended market study, NDDB
would assist the RDDC (Engineering Division) in preparing layouts, building
design and specification of equipment to meet recommended capacities and
product mix, on which, bids would be requested. Procurement of equipment,
installation and construction would be bulked into as few contracts as possible,
as NDDB, due to previous commitments, would not be available to handle all the
engineering and it would not be justified to build up the RDDC Engineering
Division to do this work considering difficulty in recruiting experienced
staff. This would also apply to the construction of the feed mills.

1/ There would be 5 unions of about 360 ± 50 societies each, however aNl unions are assumed equal for the purpose of this
model. - Each union is approximately idestified with the distri^t beoring the sane name.
2   Based on model of typical village dairy cooperative society Annex  l'  Table 1
/  Ratio of milk supply between flush and lean seasons has been assuaied to decrease from  1.4 in years 1 - 4 to 1.35 in
years 5 - 7 and 1.3 in year 8 and onwards due to introduction of ^rossbreeding and other inputs.
i   Determined on basis of average daily volumes during the peak month of the flush period.
5/  Yearly throughput becones constant after year 7 as project does not provide for further plart expansions after year 6.
i/  The Ajmer Union would take over the new plant under construction which would be expanded during years 1 - 2.
/  Computed on basis of 1 kg. feed/ 3 Lts. of milk allowing for members that would not purchase premix feed.
/  Initially premix feed would be purchased outside.                                                                                                                 . .
9/ To avoid staged expansions plants would be built to 75 ton/day capacity as required. - The first and second plant
supplying feed to all unions would initially be run by the corporation. - Each union would take over its own plant in
year 6.

RAJASTHAN DAIRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Rajasthan Dairy Development Corporation
A. Functions
1.        The Rajasthan Dairy Development Corporation would be established
to direct and coordinate the implementation of the project. The main func-
tions of the corporation would be the following:
(a) Overall coordination and execution of the Project with assistance
from NDDB.
(b) Act as the sole procurment agent for goods and services
financed under the Project;
(c) Develop and operate a bull breeding farm to provide
quality Jersey 1/ bulls for the member unions' AI services;
(d) Direct the construction of the union's plants and feed
mills;
(e) Assist the unions in preparing requests including cost
estimates and detailed engineering, for financing by
participating banks;
(f) Provide the Unions with marketing services, including a
marketing study to determine product mix capability of the
dairy plants to be built: under the project.
(g) To engage five consultants according to terms of reference
provided in Annex 6 Appendix 1, to assist in Project
implementation;
(h) To coordinate the development of dairy operations and
livestock production in the area of operation of the
member Unions.
1/   Other exotic breeds would also be considered.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
B. Investments
2.        RDDC's main investments would be for a Jersey Bull Breeding farm
for producing good quality Jersey bulls annually for sale to the unions.
Table 1 summarizes the investment requirements of the RDDC.
C. Financing Operations
3.        GOI and GOR would subscribe shares of RDDC to provide 20% of the
cost of Project investments. The remaining 80% would be borrowed from parti-
cipating banks. In addition, the operating deficit expected during years
one-three (Rs 0.55 M) would be financed as redeemable share capital by GOR.
Main source of RDDC revenues would be the sale of Jersey Bulls at Rs 9,000/head
to the unions. On the operations of the Bull Breeding Farm, RDDC would earn
a rate of return of 13% (Table 3). To cover its administrative expenses for
services provided to the unions, the RDDC would assess a levy on the unions.
Table 4 shows the consolidated cash flow of RDDC, indicating that funds would
be adequate for debt service and reserves. Table 4 also shows the purchase
of Government share holdings by the Unions in year six, which would give the
Unions a combined 75% interest in the RDDC. The GOI and GOR jointly would
hold the remaining 25% of the shares. The redemption of GOR subscriptions
for start-up costs would be separate from the above and is expected to occur
in years six and seven in equal instalments.
D. Management
4.        RDDC would administer the Project and would be governed by a 15
member Board of Directors, with the following representation: GOI: (2)
Department of Planning/Finance and Agriculture: GOR (2) Department of Animal
Husbandry; and Registrar of Cooperatives; NDDB (1); RDDC's financing institu-
tions (2), including Lead Bank or Cooperative Bank; University of Veterinary
and Animal Sciences (1); Managing Director (1) and representatives from the
Unions (5). A secretary to GOR dealing with the Project, would be the chairman
of the Board during Government majority ownership. As the Unions progres-
sively buy out Government's equiLy, Board composition in year six and there-
after would be as follows: GOI and GOR representatives (4), including
Registrar of Cooperatives, Department of Animal Hlusbandry, NDDB, University
of Veterinary and Animal Sciences; financing institutions (2); Managing
Director (1) and representatives from the Unions (8), all elected by DCS.
The Managing Director, whose qualifications and experience would be subject
to IDA approval, would carry out executive duties assisted by about five divi-
sional managers (Annex 5, Chart 1). RDDC articles of association would also
require IDA approval before incorporation.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
5.        The RDDC staff in year three would be about 40 persons (See Table
5). In year five, an overall review of the RDDC functions and staff require-
ments would take place with IDA, since by then the marketing and engineering
would cease to be an operational responsibility of RDDC. However, the RDDC
could continue to provide advisory support in these fields, besides operating
the bull breeding farm.

RAJASTHAN DAIRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Training and Extension
A. Training
1.        The factor most critical to the success of the Project is the
availability of trained and motivated manpower at all levels. While gradu-
ates in the various technical disciplines involved in the Project are avail-
able, further orientation and job related training would be required for them
to handle the responsibilities envisaged under the Project. In addition, the
task of creating 1,800 new cooperative societies would require acceptance of
cooperative principles on part of 245,000 project farmers, 16,000 members of
DCS management committees and 5,500 paid officers of DCS. This can only be
achieved through extensive education and demonstration, organized specifically
for the Project. Table 1 gives the course content, frequency and training
methods for the various training programs while Table 2 provides a cost esti-
mate for this promotional investment. Chart 1 presents the relative timing
and duration of the training and extension activities relating to a single
DCS.
DCS Level
2.        At the DCS level, the training involves a two-day visit to AMUL of
10 farming couples for each DCS prior to the formation of the DCS. These
farmers would see AMUL in action and cooperation at work. Spending a day at
the AMUL villages, they would learn firsthand about the duties and benefits
involving cooperatives. On their return to their own villages, the farmers
would be expected to participate in or lead group discussions during the
village base camps organized by the spearhead teams. These camps, of 4 days'
duration for 3 hours/day, would be held during the period of pre-DCS activity
aiming to communicate cooperative principles and AMUL experience, identify
potential leaders and build membership in preparation for the DCS operation.
Union Level
3.        At the Union Training Center (UTC), courses would be organized for
training the three-man staff of each new DCS in AI, animal first aid, milk
testing and basic record keeping. These basic courses would be of 2 months'
duration immediately preceding the village base camp, followed by a 1 week
refresher course every year. A one-week course would be organized for the
members of the management committee of each DCS in the village by the Union's
Training Center about 2 months after a DCS had commenced operations. The
management committee from two or three DCS would be trained simultaneously.
The course would use the DCS by-laws, and the record of operations as the



ANNEX 6
Page 2
training material and focus cn the objectives, potentials and pitfalls open
to a DCS with a view to formulating an annual plan of action for each individual
DCS. Cooperative principles would also be discussed. A third course also
organized at the Union level would be for the Village Extension Workers (VEWs)
of the Unions. A 2-month course, followed by 2-week refresher courses every
year, would deal with animal Droduction, crossbreeding, fodder production as
well as on cooperative princi-Ales and practices. The RDDC consultants would
contribute their expertise to the course (para. 5).
RDDC Level
4.        Most of the training; of the project implementation teams, the UTC
staff and the extension supervisors would be organized by the RDDC at NDDB
and NDRI. For the five speardead teams the program at NDDB would focus on the
AMnUL principles and practices and on the experience of NDDB with replicating
the AMUL model. The objectives would be to establish the specific systematic
approach to be followed in setting up DCS, milk collection routes, AI and
animal health services and DCS supervision, etc. (Outline of a recommended
approach to DCS implementation is given in Chart 1.) The NDRI course would
deal with the technical aspects of crossbreeding, crossbred rearing, fodder
production and feeding.
5.        The RDDC's animal production and fodder experts would organize
seminars for the extension and animal production officers of the Unions.
The results from Project demonstration farms would be evaluated and other
improved techniques would be discussed at these seminars. Similarly, the
RDDC Dairy Processing and Dairy Engineering consultants would formulate train-
ing programs for the Union's erigineers and plant managers. Terms of reference
of RDDC five consultants are given in Appendix 1.
6.        A total of 15 overseas fellowships (3 per Union) of 6 months duration
in the field of dairy plant management, dairy livestock production and cross-
breeding, and cooperative communication would be arranged by the RDDC for the
Union staff. Suitable training courses would be found in Denmark, New Zealand,
Australia and Sweden. These overseas followships would follow a 3-month
orientation course at NDDB, and would be organized in the first and second
year of the Project so that the trained staff would be available when the
dairy plants come into operationi early year three.
B. Extension
7.        To spread the concept of crossbreeding, improve animal management
and stimulate fodder production, special extension efforts would have to be
undertaken under the Project. These changes in dairy practices would have
to be implemented in a reasonably short period in order that the DCS and
the Union become financially viable institutions.



ANNEX 6
Page 3
Extension System
8.        Existing extension systems (Annex 1) attempt to cover very large
areas in all kinds of activities, and these tend to be slow in inculcating
new practices. Extension under the Project would be intensive and centralized
under the Union's divisional manager of institutional development. Training
of the Union extension staff at NDRI, along with the expertise provided by
the consultants and that developed at the Project demonstration farms, would
provide sufficient material for the extension effort, which would need to be
very vigorous during the early life of a DCS. For this purpose, one Village
Extension Worker (VEW) would be placed in each new DCS for the initial period
of 3 months. The VEW would be a member of the spearhead team during the
village base camp and would stay behind in the village to attend to its exten-
sion needs. The resident VEW would be charged with identifying and training
10 Progressive Dairy Farmers (PDF) during the 3-month assignment. Following
the resident assignment, each group of 10 DCSs would be supervised by one
VEW through 1 day stay at each DCS once every fortnight. A supervising VEW
would basically operate through PDFs, although he would devote 50% of his
time in the DCS to individual member's problems. Each Union Extension Super-
visor would direct the activities of 10 VEW's. Considering the enormous
importance of the farmer's wife in the process of changing any farming or
dairy practice, the participation of the VEW's wife in the extension activities
would be encouraged.  An extra allowance in the VEW's salary for such partici-
pation would be provided by the Union.
Selection of Staff
9.        During the 5-year Project development period when the extension
activity is very intense and totally promotional in nature, each Union's
requirement of 30 VEWts in year 1 and 50 by year 2 could be met by the
secondment of VEWs by GOR to the Union, where they would be directed by
the Union's divisional managers. The selection of VEWs for secondment to
the Union would be made by the Union and would have to be particularly meticu-
lous because of the very demanding nature of the assignment. Factors like
technical training and degrees would be assigned as much importance as moti-
vation, cooperative thinking, devotion to the welfare of farm families and
ability to work hard. The Union would be allowed to pay extra compensation
in addition to the regular salary in order to reward good performance by a
VEW. At the end of 5 years of DCS implementation, the Union would have the
option to absorb as many or as few of these VEWs as it requires into its own
staff with the rest returning to GOR.

RAJASTHAN DAIRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Project Implementation: Initial Steps
1.        The project has a defined scope and its entire implementation would
require careful planning with each step scheduled in a "critical-path" fashion.
The RDDC and the five Unions would be organized in year one and their corres-
ponding DCS would be implemented progressively over a period of five years,
only the second expansion of the dairy plants would take place in year six.
2.        The Project authority and center of coordination would be the
RDDC. This would be the seat of the hired consultants and other experienced
executives (divisional managers). They would be coordinated by the Managing
Director. The divisional managers, assisted by the consultants, would each
carry out a specific phase of the Project. This would be done by working
through his respective counterpart in the Unions who in turn would be respon-
sible for the same specific phase within his own Union.
3.        Major initial steps in implementing the project would be the fol-
lowing:
(a) Government would appoint a key team to assist in organizing
the RDDC, nominate its board, establish its headquarters and
appoint its Managing Director. NDDB's services would be contracted.
(b) With assistance of the NDDB, the team would recruit
the executive staff, including three of the five
consultants, for RDDC and the five Unions, and train
the selected candidates at NDDB.
(c) The General Managers of each Union and the Divisional
Managers of the RDDC and the Unions would be appointed.
(d) The headquarters would be established for each Union
in the main urban center of their respective district
or milk-shed regions.
(e) Each Union division would determine its workload,
schedule, staff and other facilities required in co-
ordination with the respective RDDC divisional manager:



ANNEX 7
Appendix 1
Page 2
(i) The Division of Institutional Development of each
Union would schedule the implementation of cooperative
societies, determine strength of spearhead teams
and arrange fcr their recruitment, coordinate their
training at NDDB with the teams for the other Unions
and arrange for purchase of vehicles and other
facilities.
(ii) The Division of Livestock Development of each Union
would schedule the implementation of the extension
services: animal health; AI, demonstration farms,
etc. and arrange for recruitment and training of
its staff at NDDB and NDRI also coordinated with the
teams from other Unions. Vehicles and other facilities
would be purchased.
(iii)  The Division oi Marketing of each Union would promptly
be organized fclr selling the milk collected from the
DCS in the urban centers. Until the plants are com-
missioned in year two, the milk would be sold chilled
in bulk from one or two Union owned chilling centers
temporarily installed in the cities.
(f) The Division of Marketing (RDDC) with assistance from NDDB,
would effect a marketing study to determine the most appropriate
product mix for each dairy plant, to effect economies of scale
in investment and minimize transportation of fluid milk.
(g)  The Engineering Division (RDDC) would promptly procure and
install chilling centers in the urban areas for sale of
Union milk.
(h)  The Engineering Division (RDDC) in consultation with the
other divisions of RDDC and the Unions would locate and
purchase suitable sites for the bull breeding farm, bull
farms (AI centers) and dairy and feed plants.
(i)  The Engineering Division (RDDC) would prepare specifications
in consultation with NJDDB for calling tenders for the con-
struction of the feed mills and the dairy plants based on
the marketing study. NDDB would also be consulted for
evaluation of tenders received and award of contracts.
(j) Each union would be formally registered on completing the
implementation and registration of 25 of its DCS (see
Annex 6, Chart 4).

RAJASTHAN DAIRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
1.        Primary Project benefit to the Indian economy would be increased
milk production, mainly pasturiLzed milk and milk products (475,000 tons/year
by year ten). This represents about 22% of Rajasthan's and 2% of India's
present production.
2.        Key assumptions and adjustments made in computing the economic
rate of return were that:
(a)  The prices of investment items, operating cost and milk
would remain in real terms at mid-1974 price levels;
(b) Milk production is valued at Rs 1.50/lit., which is the
composite price for ex-plant fluid milk and the portion
of the incremental farm production that does not reach
the plant. Milk products (skim milk powder and associated
butter) are valued at Rs 1.50 liter fluid milk equivalent
which is comparable to the cif price of skim milk powder
and butterfat. In the local markets, the prime impact
of the Project would be a substitution of raw milk by
pasteurized milk, with the excess being converted to
powder and products. Powder production in the winter and
reconstitution to fluid milk in the summer would dampen
out the wide fluctuations in the price of milk over the
year. Overall, a sli;ght supply effect (10-15%) on prices
would be expected and is included in the price assumptions.
(c)  Labor for plant operations and administration is priced
at the financial wage rate, and labor cost for fodder
and cattle-feed production is included in the market
price of these inputs:
(d) Cost of training and extension is charged to the Project,
as are all administrative costs of the DCS, Unions and
RDDC;
(e) Milk production, without the Project, is assumed to grow
to 3% per annum, which is slightly higher than the 1950-1970
rate of growth of 2%;



ANNEX 8
Page 2
(f) Incremental production beyond year 10 is not taken into
account since the additional processing investments
required then are not part of this Project;
(g) The residual value of the Project crossbred herd
would be the difference in market price between an
indigenous cow and a crossbred;
(h) The expected long-term increase in soil fertility and
crop yields as a result of the introduction of leguminous
fodder crops and mixed cropping systems is not included.
3.        Based on these assumptions, the economic rate of return is pro-
jected to be about 31% (Table 1).
4.        A sensitivity analysis has been carried out with respect to costs
and benefits. Table 2 summarizes the results. It costs were 10% higher
and benefits 10% lower, the rate of return would fall to 22%.
5.        To test the sensitivity of the estimated economic rate of return
to the rate of formation of successful DCS, the following assumptions were
made:
(a) The timing and the amount of investments was not altered
even though investments are to be made in three distinct
phases according to success in DCS formation;
(b) A DCS was termed "successful" if it yielded the milk
production stream of Annex 3, Table 3 1/ from the first
year of its implementation. An "unsuccessful" DCS was
assumed to take 5 years from the year of implementation
before starting on the milk production stream above.
During these five years, upgrading of native cattle
by crossbreeding was assumed not to take place;
(c) For testing the sensitivity it was assumed that DCS were
implemented at the same rate but that half of all DCS
implemented in years 1-5 were unsuccessful, as defined
above, and thus begin to yield benefits only 5 years
after being implemented. Thus the number of successful
DCS operating from year one onwards was 150, 325, 525,
725, 900, 1050, 1225, 1425, 1625, 1800 respectively, as
opposed to the original schedule of 300, 650, 1050, 1450,
and 1800, thereafter;
1/   Even for a "successful" DCS, it is projected that it would take
3 years before the full level of participation (70% of village herd)
is reached: also it takeA 3 veArs hefcre a rative hreepXble co¢
is replaced by a crossbred in milk.



ANNEX 8
Page 3
(d) The new project incremental milk production stream is
obtained from the new phased formation of "successful"
DCSs and the incrernental milk production stream for one
successful DCS (Annex 3, Table 3);
(e) Costs of operation of the DCS, union services, BVVI, DLAB,
and RDDC were assumied to be unchanged even when there are
fewer number of suc:cessful DCS during years 1-9;
(f) New operating costs for the milk plants, feed mills, and
fodder production were derived from the corresponding costs
in Annex 8, Table 1, by splitting the latter into "fixed"
and "variable" costs. "Fixed" costs were assumed to be
independent of, and the "variable" costs directly propor-
tional to, the level of operation. The level of operation
itself was assumed to be directly related to the amount of
incremental milk production. Thus,
(i)  for milk plants, from Annex 4, Table 5 (excluding
taxes and raw mnilk purchases), it was derived that
(at most) 30% of the costs were fixed while (at least)
70% were variable;
(ii)  for feed mills. from Annex 4, Table 6, it was
derived that (at most) 10% of the costs were fixed
and (at least) 90% variable; and
(iii)  for fodder production charged to the project, 100%
of the costs were assumed variable.
6.        Given the above assumptions, when the rate of formation of
successful DCS is reduced to half, but the same number is eventually formed,
the estimated rate of return Is about 24% (Annex 8, Table 3).

The timing and amount of inrestments (except training) is asosued unchanged. Training activity is continued at the intensive level for 5 additional years.
DCS are implemented snd apening costs incurred at the previous level. However, it in assumed that oniy 50% yield t4e hAM projected benfits stile the balance 50% yield none at all for first five years after implexentation.
5/    30% of costs on Annex 8 Table 1 ara fixed, and the balance 70% are directly proportional to milk handled; for feed mill, only 10% of correaponding costs on Table 1 are fixed and the
balance 90% are directly proportional to silk handled. (See paragraph 5 of Annex 8). Full 100% of the coot of fodder is directly proportional to incremental milk production.
4 Tbe are assued unchanged frm Table 1.
Derived from  the incrmcental production stream of 1 successful DCS (Annex 3 Table 3) and the rate of successful UOS toreation given in Paragraph 5 (c) of Annex 8
H Herd replacement i. comlete by year 15 but herd increase  of Annex 8 Table 1 is net coplete, and only the former benefit is includod bere.
