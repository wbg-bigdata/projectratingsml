                  overruns and delays, depending on their
                  severity, would first erode returns to equity and
                  could also jeopardize debt service. Although
                  the debt-equity ratio grants debt providers a
                  cushion of 20% (standby facilities are also
                  available), lenders are still at risk in the event of
                  a shortfall in project revenue. Cost overruns
                  and/or inefficient management of the project
                  during operation also could lead to debt service
                  default.

                  In order to streamline its appraisal of private
                  sector projects involving Bank guarantees and
                  shorten project development time, the Bank
                  intends to capitalize on project reviews by other
                  project participants. To this end, the Bank can
                  incorporate third-party project assessments into
                  its own appraisal.         For instance, since
                  commercial lenders will assume construction
                  and performance risks of a project, they will
                  closely scrutinize the project's technical and
                  financial characteristics.       If it finds them
                  satisfactory, the Bank could incorporate the
                  results of the analysis into its own appraisal.
                            The Bank's partial guarantee covers
