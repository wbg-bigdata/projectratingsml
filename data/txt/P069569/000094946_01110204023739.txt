release conditions.






REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
ON A PROPOSED PUBLIC EXPENDITURE ADJUSTMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF NIGER
I. INTRODUCTION
1.    I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a
proposed Public Expenditure Adjustment Credit (PEAC) to the Republic of Niger for
SDR 54.5 million, the equivalent of US$70 million to be disbursed in two tranches of
SDR 23.4 million (US$30 million) and SDR 31.1 million (US$40 million respectively).
This two-tranche operation would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and a
10-year grace period.
2.    The proposed credit aims at providing timely and sufficient financing to the
Government's program of poverty reduction and economic reform during 2001-2002 and
supporting the country's poverty reduction strategy, while contributing to the
consolidation of sound macroeconomic policies. In particular the credit will build upon
achievements realized with the support of the predecessor Public Finance Reform Credit',
approved in 1998, and the more recent Public Finance Recovery Credit approved in
September 20002, by continuing the support to the government's budgetary management
reform program and its efforts to improve public expenditure allocations. It will also
support the ongoing implementation of key social sector and structural reforms which
aim at improving the delivery of essential public services and promoting an enabling
environment for more sustained economic growth.
3.    While the programs underpinning the proposed credit span over the medium-term
and cannot be fully completed in the timeframe of the operation, it is envisaged that the
progress accomplished over the period considered could justify subsequent programmatic
support from IDA, e.g. in the form of a first Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) in
early 2003. Building on the I-PRSP (IDA/SecM2000-691, Board discussion on December
20, 2000) and within the overall poverty reduction framework which is expected to be
presented in 2002 in Niger's full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), the reforrns
accompanying this credit will support laying the groundwork for programmatic support,
through the elements of the government's reform program described in the attached
Letter of Development Policy. The proposed credit is fully consistent with IDA's
Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the Board in 1997. A CAS progress report is
presented for discussion along with this credit. The CAS Progress Report highlights the
importance of budgetary reform to support Niger's poverty reduction efforts.

II. BACKGROUND
A. Country Context
4.     Niger is a landlocked Sahelian country characterized by a very limited natural
resource base and high vulnerability to external shocks, such as droughts, that take a
heavy toll on economic growth and living standards. Its population is estimated at 10.5
million, 80 percent of which lives in rural areas, with a high growth rate of 3.3 percent
annually3.  Rainfall, averaging less than 400 millimeters per year since the 1970's, is
erratic and generally insufficient to ensure adequate agricultural production, rendering
Niger perhaps the Sahelian country most vulnerable to desertification. The combination
of rapid population growth, southward migration due to droughts, and few opportunities
of employment outside of agriculture, has put increasing pressure on limited amounts of
arable land, which was reduced by half since 1965. Today, about 85 percent of Niger's
population are concentrated in a 100-150 kilometers-wide corridor running north of the
1,600 km-long border with Nigeria.

census has been undertaken in 2001, which will provide a sound basis for demographic and social analysis
starting in 2002.

5.    Social Development and Poverty. Social indicators are extremely poor (see
Table 1). GNP per capita stood at approximately US$200 in 2000 (World Bank Atlas
method), and Niger ranks 161't out of 162 countries listed in UNDP's 2000 Human
Development Report (HDR). Vulnerability to drought leads to food insecurity and
consequently malnutrition, which affects close to half the children under 5 years old.
Combined with poor access to safe water and the high incidence of parasitic and
respiratory diseases, this results in an infant mortality rate of 118 and life expectancy at
birth of about 46 years. Adult illiteracy remains high at 85 percent and gross primary
enrollment rates are low at 34 percent overall, with a sharp distinction between male and
female enrollment at 38 and 27 percent, respectively. The burden of poverty and low
social development falls disproportionately on women, whose access to land, credit,
technology, and social services remains limited. The last poverty assessment, published
by the Government with Bank support in 1996, estimates a 63 percent poverty headcount
rate (using the official poverty threshold of less than US$ 1/day in 1993), with 34 percent
of the population considered destitute. The assessment shows that most of the poor live
in rural areas and that poverty is strongly associated with large family size, a lack of
education, owning no livestock, and (in rural areas) living in a female-headed household.4
Poverty rates have likely increased in recent years: the average 1993-2000 GDP growth
rate is only slightly higher than the population growth rate, and falls short of the annual
5-6 percent deemed necessary for a reduction in relative and absolute poverty.
6.    Political Context. Following independence from France in 1960, widespread
corruption within the newly established political elite and a series of droughts in 1968-74
led to unrest and the overthrow in 1974 of the civilian government by the military,
starting the long domination of an authoritarian regime under the leadership of General
Seiny Kountche. Through 1990 and 1991, various groups stepped up calls for a
multiparty system, and a national conference was held in 1991 that paved the way for the
first multiparty constitution. Since the adoption of this constitution in 1991, Niger's
political landscape has been shaped by unstable coalition arrangements in the wake of the
various national elections. These episodes of instability culminated into two coups d'e'tat,
staged in 1996 and 1999. Over the last decade, the political situation was further
complicated by tense social relations as recurrent difficulties in public finances fueled the
discontent of the powerful trade unions as well as student unrest. In addition, waves of
rebellious movements in the northern and eastern part of the country erupted in the first
half of the 1990's. The implementation of a peace accord signed in 1995 has led to a
gradual pacification of the rebellion. The transition regime controlled by the military
junta that had taken over after the April 1999 coup, handed power over to a civilian
Governrnent, following orderly presidential and legislative elections completed in
December 1999. Since January 2000, social and political tensions have subsided,
although the government is regularly challenged by parliamentary opposition,
intermittent strikes in the public sector and student unrest.
4In the framework of the PRSP, the Government is preparing a program to update the poverty information
database with both quantitative and qualitative surveys (see paragraph 63 below).

7.    Economic Context: The growth record of Niger's rural-based and poorly
diversified formal economy is to a large extent determined by factors such as climatic
conditions and the level of external financing. Niger experienced a short-lived period of
sustained growth in the late 1970's, recording double-digit GDP growth rates for a few
years, when activity was stimulated by the discovery and exploitation of uranium
resources in the North of the country. Since then, real GDP growth rates have been highly
volatile and low on average, as a result of declining uranium demand, two severe
droughts, the real overvaluation of the currency and other market distortions, as well as
poor management of public finances. As a member of the West African Economic and
Monetary Union (WAEMU), sharing a common currency and a central bank with seven
other west African countries, Niger benefited from the January 1994 CFA Franc
devaluation, but perhaps to a lesser extent than the more diversified coastal countries.
Some competitiveness was restored to the economy, contributing to reinvigorating
economic growth that has averaged 3.5 percent a year since 1994.
8.    Regional integration and WAEMU membership has also translated into the
implementation of trade liberalization policies with the implementation of a common
external tariff in 2000 and the progressive harmonization of regulations in other areas
such as public finance. It should be noted, however, that Niger's main sub-regional
economic partner is Nigeria, itself not a member of WAEMU. Trade and investment
flows along the border between the two countries are mostly unrecorded but estimated to
be substantial.
9.    Niger's primary sector (about 40 percent of GDP in 1999) is dominated by rain-
fed agriculture, while livestock production accounts for about a third of the value added
in the sector. However, agro-pastoral GDP grew at an annual average rate of only 1.1
percent in real terms in the period 1969-98, mainly from increased cultivation area. This
has translated into an annual decline in per capita agricultural GDP of about 2 percent,
and an increase in the number of households vulnerable to food insecurity. Unlike other
Sahelian countries that have experienced productivity gains in cereals, yields of Nigerien
staples (millet, sorghum) are low and declining. Having increased dramatically during
the uranium boom, the share of the secondary sector in total production has stagnated
around the current level of 18 percent over the past ten years. Growth in the tertiary
sector (44 percent of GDP) has been stagnant over the long term, although there has been
a moderate pick-up since 1995 due to increased trade activities. Despite shrinking
somewhat over the last ten years, the state's share in the formnal economy remains
significant, representing just under a third of total value added in the "modem" economy.
10.   Niger's performance in terms of fiscal management has been erratic in the last
decade. Given the country's weak performance in terms of domestic revenue
mobilization, political instability has recurrently affected the availability of external
resources, while adverse shocks, such as droughts, have put additional demands on public
expenditure. This led to the accumulation of external and domestic payment arrears for
most of the 1990's. In addition, persistent weaknesses in public expenditure management
have prevented a significant improvement in the efficiency of spending.

11.    The successful return to a democratically elected government at the end of 1999,
and the important initial efforts undertaken by the new Government in restoring financial
stability and resurrecting the reform program, led to the preparation of a new three-year
macroeconomic program supported by a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
approved by the IMF's Board in December 2000, as well as to the country's access to the
Decision Point of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative at that same time. To support the
preparation of the PRGF and the HIPC decision point, the government also prepared an
Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy paper (I-PRSP), which provides a provisional outline
of the Govermment's development strategy.

12.    External debt costs a long shadow  on Niger's development prospects and the
analysis undertaken in the preparation of Niger's accession to the Enhanced HIPC
Initiative has shown that its level is clearly unsustainable. At the end of 1999, total
outstanding debt stood at US$1,604 million. In net present value terms, the 1999 stock of
external debt amounted to 48 percent of GDP or 322 percent of exports. Assistance
provided under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative is estimated at US$520.6 in NPV terms, or
53.5 percent of the outstanding debt at the decision point. While the bulk of this
assistance will be provided at the completion point, expected by early 2003, some
multilateral creditors including IDA, the IMF and the African Development Bank have
decided to provide interim assistance starting in 2001 equivalent to 0.6 percent of GDP
for the current year. The debt sustainability analysis and related sensitivity simulations
have shown that Niger's external debt situation remains extremely fragile, even after
taking into account the relief provided under the Initiative. In particular, the debt burden

would again become unsustainable if the long-term growth projections assumed in the
HIPC scenario fail to materialize (an average 5 percent growth rate between 2000 and
2019), and, even more strikingly, if Niger fails to receive very favorable financing

conditions for its public investment and budgetary gaps
B. Recent Macroeconomic Developments
Macroeconomic performance during 1996-99
13.   Between 1996 and 1998, economic and financial performance was broadly
satisfactory under the program implemented by the authorities with the support of IDA
and Fund resources. Real GDP accelerated to an average 5.5 percent over the period
1996-98, mainly because of exceptional rainfall and strong agricultural production in
1998. The strengthening of Niger's external competitiveness following the devaluation of
the CFA franc contributed to a strengthening of the external position, with the current
account deficit (excluding official transfers) falling from 14.9 percent in 1994 to an
estimated 10 percent of GDP in 1998. At the same time, the overall government budget
deficit (on a commitment basis and excluding grants) was brought down to 5.4 percent of
GDP in 1996, before increasing to 8.1 percent of GDP in 1998. Inflation, as measured by
changes in the consumer price index for Niamey, declined rapidly after 1994, reaching
5.5 percent in 1995 and remained below 5 percent since then.
14.   The political events and the violent coup of April 1999 resulted in a temporary
interruption of Niger's satisfactory macroeconomic performance, a freezing of nearly all
non-project external financing and delays in the implementation of structural reforms.
The financial situation of Niger deteriorated significantly, with: (i) a substantial increase
in the fiscal deficit (accrual and excluding grants) from 9.7 percent of GDP, (ii) large
accumulations of external and domestic payments arrears (including seven months of
civil service salaries), raising the estimated total stock of payments arrears at end-1999 to
more than 19 percent of GDP; and (iii) issues of governance and transparency regarding
expenditure effected at the end of the transition regime. In addition to a deterioration of
public finances, real economic growth was slightly negative in 1999 (-0.6 percent) and
the overall balance of payments deficit widened. It was financed mainly through an
accumulation of external payments arrears (nearly 2 percent of GDP) and a large draw-
down on net foreign assets.
Outcomes in 2000 and early 2001
15.   The democratically elected civilian goverrnment that took office in January 2000
inherited a very difficult situation, which was further complicated by escalating
petroleum prices on the world market. However, the new government implemented a
5 In the Enhanced HIPC framework, the sustainability threshold for the NPV of debt-to-export ratio is set at
150 percent. Financing assumptions in the HIPC decision point document foresee project-related and
budgetary financing needs to be covered by 70 percent grants while the remainder is provided through
loans at standard IDA terms.



- 7 -
series of far-reaching measures starting in January 2000 to restore the financial and
economic situation through the adoption of a strictly enforced cash rationing system and
the establishment of expenditure priorities ensuring full payment of salaries, avoiding the
accumulation of domestic payments arrears, and orderly, if incomplete, external debt
servicing. These priorities were justified by the need to ease domestic social tensions and
strengthen relations with external partners. A revised Budget Law was enacted in May
2000 which corrected unrealistic revenue projections and several important actions were
taken by the government in the area of fiscal discipline and accountability, such as the
regular and timely closing of fiscal accounts. These measures provided a solid foundation
for improved budgetary management in the remainder of the year 2000, and prompted the
Bank to conclude an agreement for a Public Finance Recovery Credit which was
approved in September 2000, exceptionally, before the formal PRGF agreement in order
to help sustain the Government's initial stabilization and reform efforts.
16.   Those efforts undertaken during the year 2000 achieved the desired results on the
macroeconomic front, as evidenced by the recent satisfactory conclusion the PRGF' s first
mid-term review (August 2001). Program objectives were reached with respect to all
major benchmarks with the exception of the wage bill and the reduction of domestic
arrears. At end-2000, the overall budget deficit (accrual and excluding grants) was held to
7.4 percent of GDP, in line with program objectives. Despite the reduction in trade tariffs
brought about by the adoption of the WAEMU common external tariff, total budgetary
revenue was maintained at 8.5 percent of GDP, while total expenditure stood at
15.9 percent of GDP (including an off-budget, implicit subsidy of petroleum products
equivalent to 0.4 percent of GDP). Wages were paid on a regular basis, and one month of
wage bill arrears was settled. The slight overshooting of the wage bill target is
attributable to the delay by a couple of months in the implementation of the new civil
retirement regime. This delay was justified by the need to avoid a disruption for the
concerned teaching positions before the end of the school year. Clearly, the strict
observance of budgetary financing constraints and the priority given to some
expenditures made regular budget execution difficult, affecting the overall delivery of
public services and the execution of the public investment program.
17.   Performance of the real economy, however, was again constrained by insufficient
rainfall in 2000. The resulting decline in agricultural production led to a stagnation in real
GDP growth as well as to a slight acceleration in consumer prices because of increasing
food prices. The persistence of the economic slowdown also had an impact on trade, with
the current account deficit (excluding grants) remaining about 1 percentage point of GDP
below target. While net credit to Government decreased sharply because of the fiscal
restraint, another significant macroeconomic development in 2000 relates to the growth
of credit to the economy, which surged by more than 40 percent year-on-year mainly
because of the increased financing needs of companies active in the petroleum products
sector. Despite two retail gasoline price adjustments in 2000, the administrated pricing
system led to the absorption of a large part of the negative stabilization by the state-
owned importation company throughout the year 2000.
18.   Preliminary fiscal outcomes for 2001. Performance in the first quarter of 2001
remained satisfactory, with positive results in terms of net credit to government,

budgetary revenues and the containment of the wage bill. However, because non-wage
current expenditure grew faster than programmed, the basic balance, which excludes
externally financed investment spending, posted a deficit of FCFA 17.8 billion (accrual)
vs. the FCFA 5.1 billion foreseen in the program. The faster pace of expenditure
commitments in the first quarter reflects the Government's decision to free one fourth of
yearly credits in order to restore adequate provision of public services, which had
suffered somewhat during the stabilization efforts of 2000.  The good revenue
performance and disbursements on budget aid in the beginning of the year provided
adequate financing in justification of this decision. While it noted the weakening of the
fiscal performance in the first quarter of the year, the fist mid-term review of the PRGF
also provided an assessment that the slightly revised macroeconomic targets can be met
by year end without accumulation of new payment arrears, provided the anticipated
external support materializes, including the proposed adjustment support from IDA.
19.   The 2001 supplemental budget. In line with the commitments made in the
framework of the HIPC decision point discussion, the government prepared a
supplemental budget law, which includes the interim resources from the Initiative. These
interim HIPC resources, worth about US$12.3 million or 0.7 percent of GDP will finance
a poverty reduction program focusing on social sector and rural infrastructure, which is
consistent with the poverty reduction objectives outlined in the I-PRSP. The program
launched by the Head of State in consultation with the concerned sector ministries,
consists in the building of primary classrooms, health posts, wells and small reservoirs,
mainly in rural areas. Capital spending represents about four fifths of the incremental
expenditure financed by the interim assistance, while the remainder is allocated to
sustaining expenditure as well as special programs aiming at the advancement of women.
For the implementation of constructions at the community level, the government relied
on participation, notably by replicating successful initiatives piloted by NGOs. The
selection of sites also appears to have followed a bottom-up, participatory process. Initial
positive lessons to be drawn from this program relate to the effective channeling of
resources at the decentralized level, and the establishment of an output-oriented
monitoring and tracking system. However, the implementation of the program poses a
certain number of challenges which will need to be addressed up front, including the
coordination of the special program with ongoing sector strategies. In particular for the
health sector, the increased demand for support staff for the health posts will need to
accommodated without affecting the adequate staffing of the higher level health facilities
(Centres de Sante Integres). The Ministry of Public Health is currently updating its
human resource management policy to resolve this issue (see below). Also, the
government has committed to report on the financial management and realizations of the
program and a tracking framework is being established to that end.
20.  In addition, the supplemental budget also integrates the proceeds from the sale of
two mobile phone operating licenses in November 2000, amounting to US$11.7 million,
which had been secured in a central bank account until proper budgetization. In line with
recommendations from the Fund and the Bank, the government has earmarked these
funds to the settlement of external and domestic arrears as well as incremental capital
spending. Finally, the government also slightly increased budgetary allocations for a
response to the substantial food shortages in some parts of the country, as well as to



- 9 -
address increased security needs at the northern and eastemn borders of the country6. The
revised budgetary framework, after taking the supplemental into account, raises the
projected budget deficit (excluding grants, accrual basis) by 0.9 percent of GDP to an
estimated 8.9 percent. If all expected external support materializes, the resulting increase
in the financing gap to be domestically covered would amount to about 1 percent of GDP,
three-fifths of which are already secured from the sale of the mobile phone licenses.
C. Medium-term macroeconomic projections and financing requirements
21.    The Government's macroeconomic projections for 2001-2004 anticipate a gradual
acceleration in growth to reach an annual average of 4.4 percent in real terms over the
period. Assuming a constant population growth rate, this would translate into 1.1 percent
real growth in annual per capita income. Growth forecasts in Niger are complicated by
the country's high vulnerability to external shocks such as adverse climatic conditions.
Preliminary rainfall data for 2001 suggest that agricultural production could suffice to
fuel the growth rate foreseen in the framework. For subsequent years, and barring the
occurrence of a severe drought, it is expected that the further consolidation of political
and financial stability will be conducive to an increase in investment of both private and
public origin, and contribute to the attainment of the growth targets over the period.

6 Bank staff estimates suggest that this additional spending would bring allocations for national defense
spending (excluding police and interior security) to about 1.3 percent of GDP from 1.2 percent in the initial
budget. This actually translates into a reduction in the share of defense spending in total expenditures from
the general budget (recurrent and domestically financed investment spending) from 7.8 percent to 7.7
percent because of the higher increase in other spending items (including the special program).
7 The impact of the post-September 11 deterioration of the international environment on Niger's
macroeconomic framework, will be discussed with the authorities in the framework of the second PRGF
mid-term review before year end. Preliminary estimates suggest that economic growth in 2002 could be
affected by half a percentage point, while the external financing requirements could increase by about
USD15 million. The size of the proposed credit takes into account the potential consequence of the global
slowdown in 2002.



- 10-
22.    As  a  major  stimulus  to  this  improved  economic  performance, domestic
investment is expected to gradually increase from an estimated 10.6 percent of GDP in
2000 to above 15 percent by 2003, with the share of public investment in gross fixed
investment remaining at around 60 percent throughout the period. Domestic savings
would also rise to about 5.6 percent in 2003, on account of rising budgetary revenues (to
above 10 percent of GDP by 2003) and higher private domestic savings. As a result, the
current account deficit (before official transfers) would oscillate around 11 percent of
GDP over the period. Given the expectation of prudent monetary policies from the
regional Central Bank, inflation would stabilize at around 3 percent after the moderate
pick-up in 2001 induced by higher food prices in the first half of the year.
23.    As mentioned earlier, Niger's access to the Enhanced HIPC Initiative will reduce
its external debt burden over the next twenty years by US$521 in 1999 NPV terms, with
multilateral creditors expected to provide US$309 million, Paris Club bilaterals the
equivalent of US$209 million and other bilateral creditors US$104 million8. IDA, the
IMF and AfDB provide interim debt relief on the multilateral side, while Niger was able
to reach a new agreement with the Paris Club in January 2001, which includes a flow
rescheduling on Cologne terms for debt service due in 2001-2003 as well as a
rescheduling of arrears on Naples terms. Cash-flow relief in the interim period is
expected to reach on average US$13.2 million per year in 2001-2002, and increase to
above US$50 million in 2003, assuming Niger will have reached the floating completion
point by then.

assistance also includes relief worth US$2.2 million from commercial creditors.

24.   The external financing gap for 2001 before debt relief and committed external
project financing is estimated at CFAF 186.6 billion, or US$261 million. After debt
relief (including HIPC) and identified project aid, the residual financing would stand at
about CFAF 93.6 billion or about US$131 million. A slightly reduced gap is expected in
2002 (see table 4). The proposed operation would contribute to financing about 28
percent of the gap over the period 2001-2002. Other donors including the EU, the AfDB
and key bilateral partners such as France are expected to provide additional budgetary
assistance to cover the residual financing need. Sufficient and timely availability of
external budgetary support is essential to help financing the delivery of basic services and
allow the Government to pursue the implementation of its reform program. On their side,
the Nigerien authorities are committed to respect their macroeconomic targets, not only
to preserve the hard won stability but also foremost to allow regular and orderly
management of the public expenditure program, while avoiding the past episodes of
arrears accumulation which characterized much of the nineties and led to arbitrary cash
rationing systems.
III. NIGER'S POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY AND ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAMS
25.   A first comprehensive medium-term reform program was launched in 1996,
which received the support of the IMF (three-year ESAF) and that of the Bank (two
adjustment credits)9. Overall performance under the program  was evaluated to be
satisfactory as evidenced by the successful completion of the first two mid-term reviews
of the ESAF and the satisfactory completion rating of the Bank's first adjustment
operation. The program's main achievements were realized in the areas of public finance
management (especially revenue mobilization), civil service reform (wage bill control)
and divestiture from public enterprises. Unfortunately, this first wave of reform was
interrupted by the 1999 political events, which prevented the completion of the third
ESAF mid-term review and led to the cancellation of the second, three-tranche IDA
operation with two tranches undisbursed.
26.   Quickly after being appointed, the current government revived and broadened the
main elements of the 1996 reform program whose agenda was left unfinished before the
coup. In 2000, Bank and Fund support, as well as that from other major donors, relied on
a series of prior actions in the area of budgetary management, taken to complement the
stabilization efforts. These measures included: (i) the adoption of a supplementary
budget law for 2000 which brought revenues and expenditures back to realistic levels
while preserving as much as possible social spending, (ii) elimination of the implicit
subsidy on petroleum products through two increases in the prices of petroleum products;
(iii) the formal closing of fiscal accounts for 1997, for the first time in a decade, with the
transmission of a budget review law to the National Assembly and of the corresponding
treasury accounts to the Supreme Court's Chamber of Accounts (accounting office) for
auditing purposes; and (iv) verification of the conformity with the budget procedures of
expenditure effected at end-1999. The program also included a series of measures in
9 The single-tranche IDA credit (Public Sector Adjustment Credit, PSAC) approved and disbursed in
September 1997, and the three-tranche Public Finance Reform Credit (PFRC), approved in October 1998.



- 12 -
other areas of social sector and structural reforms which are briefly described in the next
sections. Many of these measures were taken while external financing had not yet
resumed, demonstrating the government's commitment and ownership of the reforms.
Initially, the program had been outlined in the Prime Minister's inauguration address to
the National Assembly. The budgetary component of the program was later formalized in
the Letter of Development Policy underpinning IDA's single tranche Public Finance
Recovery Credit. Finally, at the end of 2000, the authorities presented the Interim PRSP
which provided a more comprehensive agenda for poverty reduction and economic
reforms.
27.   The Interim PRSP. In addressing the special challenges of a landlocked country
with limited natural resources, low human development and where desertification is a
serious threat, the government's policy priorities proposed in the I-PRSP focus on
responding to what are believed to be the root causes of poverty: lack of food security
and opportunities for rural income-generation, insufficient access to health and education,
poor infrastructure (water and roads) and the excessive hardship imposed on women. To
attempt addressing these concerns, the I-PRSP defines a first roadmap which targets
promoting human development by reinforcing basic education and health care, enhancing
rural infrastructure (mainly rural roads and water resources) and growth opportunities in
the rural economy, and establishing an environment conducive to private sector
development, including judicial reform.  Furthermore, the I-PRSP identifies as
indispensable policy vectors to sustain any improvement in the delivery of basic social
services, the sound management of public (human and financial) resources and structural
reforms, especially in the areas of private and financial sector development.
28.   The government recognizes that given the immensity of needs and the limited
available resources, enhancing the quality of public spending is essential for the strategy
to achieve its objectives. Improved transparency and accountability in public financial
management is also seen as an essential factor for establishing good governance and
providing an incentive framework for the civil service to provide quality services. In
addition, because of the structural mismatch between the needs to be addressed and
available public resources, the role of the State is being re-examined across sectors. Even
in sectors where the State has traditionally been the dominant, if not the lone service
supplier, such as education and health, the potential for partnerships with non-
governmental organizations and private sector providers has been explored on an
experimental basis and will be further promoted in the coming years.
29.   Niger is now preparing a full PRSP where the policy priorities initially proposed
in the I-PRSP are being revisited, put to the test of participatory validation mechanisms
and fturther refined, inter alia with the determination of measurable poverty reduction
objectives. The full PRSP will also attempt to provide a first cost estimate of the
proposed strategy, which should be refined as sectoral ministries establish their medium-

(M&E) systems, and to design a framework for systematic M&E to inform policy
decisions in the course of the PRSP's implementation. °
30.   The full PRSP is expected to be completed and presented in early 2002. In the
meantime, the Government has prepared an economic reform program based on the key
objectives of the I-PRSP which have been validated through the initial work undertaken
for the preparation of the full PRSP. This program, which the proposed credit would help
support, is described in the attached Letter of Development Policy (Annex H) and focuses
on three key reform areas deemed essential for promoting economic growth and
facilitating poverty reduction:
* the continuation and deepening of the budgetary reform program, and the
fiurther strengthening of the link between poverty reduction objectives and
public expenditure allocations;
* the policies to expand coverage and enhance quality of basic social services;
* the completion of key structural reforms expected to promote private sector-led
growth.
The next sections provide additional details on recent achievements, outstanding issues
and proposed actions in these policy areas.
A. The Budgetary Management Reform Program
Recent achievements and outstanding issues
31.   As highlighted above, Niger has been plagued over the last decade by political
instability which has compounded fiscal management problems, often resulting in
outright public finance crises. The unpredictability in the timing and size of aid flows, on
which Government programs are very dependent, as well as the persistently low
mobilization of domestic resources has induced recurrent liquidity shortages and the
accumulation of arrears. This has disrupted budget execution, often at the expense of
essential spending programs, and prevented government from appropriately focusing on
improving the quality of expenditure. In 2000, the new government identified a set of
fiscal management reforms to address the numerous remaining challenges in such areas
as recording and tracking of transactions, the upgrade of a financial management
information system (FMIS), or the modernization of the public accounting framework.
Based on this initial program of actions, as well as on a series of other achievements, the
Bank approved the Public Finance Recovery Credit. The implementation of the actions
underpinning the Recovery Credit was altogether successful, although an evaluation of
the program is only possible in the coming years, as many the reforms span over the
medium term. In addition, the implementation of some reforms was delayed in 2001 as

support to poverty reduction in Niger are described in the CAS progress report presented along with this
operation.

attention focused on the imperatives of financial stabilization. Accordingly, outstanding
issues remain numerous along the budgetary cycle.
32.   In past design of fiscal reform programs, budget formulation has perhaps not
received the same level of attention as execution, because of the focus on short-term
stabilization objectives. However, improvements in budget preparation were realized as
the 2000 (supplemental) and 2001 Finance Laws have been based on more realistic
assessments of available resources, and led to an appropriate calibration of the
expenditure program. However, the budget formulation process still shows important
systemic shortcomings. While it covers all sources of the central government's revenues
and expenditures, the Finance Law presented to the National Assembly cannot be
regarded as a fully unified budget, in the sense that it is split in two main budgets, as well
as "annexed budgets" and a series of special accounts or funds (Comptes speciaux du
Tresor). The two main budgets follow the typical pattern of dual budgeting, with one
"general budget" and an "investment budget". The latter would more accurately be
described as a development or project budget as it lists the (mainly externally financed)
projects from the Public Investment Plan for which the erstwhile Ministry of Plan
expected some activity in the year considered, and includes, therefore, recurrent spending
associated with project implementation. On the other hand, it should be noted that the
national contribution to the "investment budget" (counterpart funds) appears as an
expenditure in the general budget, so that the latter in fact includes (non-project related)
recurrent spending, as well as capital expenditures of the central government. While
deconcentrated expenditures appear in the general budget, there is little or no
consolidated informnation about local government budgets. 'I
33.   Other issues related to budget formulation include the sub-optimal use of outturn
data, with the exception perhaps of the wage bill data. Very recently, however, the
government made better use of existing information on public consumption of utilities.
Also, the public expenditure reviews undertaken in the health and education sectors have
had an impact on budget preparation in these sectors, translating into increased
allocations for non-wage recurrent spending. Still, the preparation remains particularly
weak for external debt service, and transfers (subsidies, scholarships) and many other
items of non-wage current spending. This explains the largely unrealistic budgets of the
past decade in which revenues and financing assumptions are often very optimistic with
the consequence of discretionary cash triage and the accumulation of domestic arrears.
As a benchmark of the recent progress, the 2001 Finance Laws (both initial and
supplemental) are fully consistent with the PGRF-supported program objectives, a
consistency which had not been observed in the past.
34.   More fundamentally, the time horizon of the routine budget preparation process is
still limited to a year. There is little reflection on a medium-term budgetary framework
which would meaningfully support the development strategies prepared at the sectoral

in September 2001. This lays the institutional foundation for improved integration of investment and
recurrent budgets.

level, themselves often spanning over a decade. Similarly, at the sectoral level, while the
strategies are often technically sound, they most often do not incorporate the financial
requirements needed to achieve development objectives, beyond a list of existing and
future projects.
35.   With respect to budget classification, the current 6-digit general budget
nomenclature is a mix of economic and "administrative" classification 12, quite disparate
across ministries, thereby offering limited potential for a thorough expenditure analysis
on the sole basis of budget documents. This obviously also complicates expenditure
tracking. In addition, the investment budget nomenclature is not consistent with the one
of the general budget.
36.   The budget execution process remains cumbersome, as it is still tailored to
manual recording and control processes. Compliance by spending agencies has often
been weak in the past, and committed expenditures have not always respected the
priorities set by budget regulation (credit rationing) or even the Finance Law itself. The
internal control system is typical of the francophone system relying on a series of ex ante
and simultaneous controls. Despite these various layers of control, arrears have been
accumulated and there have been episodes in which certain powerful spending agencies
by-passed the procedures through the exaggerated use of advance payment practices.
This problem became endemic in 1997, was abolished in 1998, but is reappearing from
time to time. It should be noted that salaries, utility payments and deconcentrated
expenditures (delegations de credits) follow streamlined procedures. For the latter, in
particular, internal control is left to the discretion of the local Treasury agency with little
feedback information. Recent actions in the area of expenditure management have
mainly focused on introducing the computerization of budgetary processes (see below).
While it is expected that the use of improved technology will provide the opportunity to
streamline administrative processes, the government recognizes that it has yet to fully
think through the steps to make the actual procedures governing the expenditure circuit
more efficient.
37.   In-year budgetary reporting is sporadic, responding to ad hoc needs from
decision-makers. The data usually covers commitments and payment orders, and there is
no automatic reconciliation with the data on actual payments from Treasury. The
difficulty of ensuring that payment information is consistent with commitment reports
lies with the rather opaque chart of public accounts. Although the situation has improved
recently, inaccurate or untimely accounting and the frequent recourse to suspense
accounts complicate the compilation of comprehensive and reliable payments data. The
government has since 2000 established a data reconciliation process on the revenue side,
which should be further facilitated with the recent decision to merge tax issuance and
collection authority (these were separate for most direct taxes until the 2001 Finance
Law). The actual reconciliation between cash and accrual data for management purposes
12 The administrative classification follows the list of existing Ministries in Niger and is not fully
consistent with the functional classification as presented in the Government Financial Statistics (GFS)
manual.



- 16 -
is attempted in the Policy analysis division of the Ministry of Finance, which prepares a
monthly summary statement of government financial operations (Tableau des Op&rations
Financieres de I'Etat, TOFE). The quality of the TOFE, which broadly follows the
architecture proposed in the GFS Manual, usually suffers from the weaknesses
encountered in commitments recording and cash accounting.
38.   Cash management is especially challenging in Niger, a country which relies
heavily on external financing with unpredictable timing, has extremely limited recourse
to central bank bridge-financing, or is not yet in a position to issue securities. As
mentioned earlier, in an effort at financial stabilization, backward-looking cash budgeting
has characterized much of the year 2000. In principle, the pace of expenditure is
determined since 1998 by a two-tier cash-rationing system, which is fully integrated in
the computerized information system. Strategic decision-making on cash allocations were
attributed to a Treasury Committee which would also prepare rolling cash management
plans. This fairly ambitious framework has to date not been functioning well. Until the
end of 1999, many loopholes emerged in the expenditure regulation system as many
important line items were gradually exempted from complying with the temporary credit
ceilings imposed by the system. Second, the Treasury Committee never really functioned,
despite the adoption of related legislation. Cash management is de facto left to the
discretion of the leadership of the Ministry of Finance. The new government has
nevertheless introduced the establishment of monthly treasury plans on a rolling basis,
which have proven useful in regulating commitments.
39.   A new Financial Management Information System (FMIS) was developed to
cope with the Y2K problem in late 1999. The system is based on a server-client
environment and offers many opportunities in terms of improved recording, reporting,
safety (tracking) and, eventually, a simplification for the overall expenditure process. To
date, this potential is still largely untapped. The scope of the system is currently limited
to the commitment authorizations and payment orders. Actual payments made by the
Treasury are recorded in a separate environment, and there is no automated data
exchange. As mentioned earlier, the diverging nomenclatures between the budget and the
accounting systems make reconciliation difficult and efforts to organize ad hoc
reconciliation sessions are organized to temporarily cope with this situation. In principle,
data on commitment and payment orders issued for most current expenditure items are
available in real time. But data on the investment budget (in fact, externally financed
projects) are lagging. As the investment budget is in fact a "development budget" also
including certain recurrent expenditures, these data problems do affect overall budget
analysis. The input of information on payments for external debt service and the
deconcentrated expenditures is also lagging.'
40.   With respect to accounting, the Treasury's chart of accounts is being cleansed and
accounting discipline restored, but the current chart is still characterized by sizeable
13 While the actual commitment for deconcentrated expenditures is fairly simple, their budgetary recording
and accounting are particularly cumbersome, as payment orders for these expenditures are actually issued
ex post, once the information on the completed transactions surfaces back from the regions, usually with
considerable delays.

suspense accounts and overall poor readability, requiring a more general overhaul. In
addition the Treasury balance sheet has failed to show an opening balance for many
years. An opening balance has been reconstructed for 1997 and 1998, and the process is
being carried forward in order to establish a provisional opening balance for the current
fiscal year. 14
41.   Formal reconciliation of the whole budget for a complete fiscal year (1997) was
completed in 2000, for the first time in about 15 years, resulting in the preparation of a
budget review law (loi de reglement) and the compilation of Treasury accounts (comptes
de gestion). In accordance with Nigerien legislation, the budget review law was sent to
the National Assembly where it should be discussed, while the treasury accounts were
deposited at the Audit Office of the Supreme Court for auditing purposes. Similarly, the
accounts for 1998 and 1999 were very recently closed, and the related budget review
laws prepared. It is expected that the nornal rhythm  for processing the documents
sanctioning the closing of accounts can be reestablished in 2002. While these actions
reintroduced the discipline of formally closing budgetary accounts, a further
development impact will be the actual evaluation of budget execution and the
certification of the accounts by the National Assembly and the Audit Office of the
Supreme Court respectively. At this time, the capacity of these institutions to perform
these tasks is limited, both on account of insufficient human resources , and because of
the lack of experience in auditing public accounts.
42.   Another extremely important area of reforms related to budget execution is public
procurement. A Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) completed by the
Bank in 1999 concluded that the procurement system in Niger shows a significant
number of deficiencies linked to legal and institutional weaknesses, as well as non-
compliance with the existing procedures. The recommendations made in the report can be
summarized in three broad categories: (i) reform of the legal and regulatory framework;
(ii) institutional reform to ensure adequate accountability and transparency; and (iii)
capacity building and development of procurement expertise.
43.   Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs) have been completed by the government in
the education and health sectors (1998/1999), as well as more recently for the rural
development sector (1999). While these PERs provide an in-depth analyses of intra-
sectoral budgetary trends, as well as an initial attempt to analyze the cost-efficiency of
public expenditure in these areas, they need to be taken one step further to address
incidence issues and cover the whole budget.
The policy framework for 2001-2003 in the area offiscal reforms
44.   The relevance of actions laid out in the government's policy statement annexed to
the 2000 Public Finance Recovery Credit remains, and they seek to address many of the
issues raised above. Although notable achievements were realized over the last months,
the reform agenda remains unfinished as was also foreseen at the time of the Recovery

Credit's presentation (since most of these reforms would only be completed and show
results over the medium term, i.e. well beyond the life span of the single-tranche
operation). However, in the process of preparing the PRSP, the Government felt that this
program could be improved in terms of its logical design and strategic anchoring. The
government has therefore decided to revisit the program and developed a framework for
budgetary management reform with the objectives of (i) linking the program to the
broader development agenda and the poverty reduction objectives set forth in the PRSP,
(ii) seeking to ensure a logical consistency and sequencing of the measures proposed in
the program, and (iii) better taking into account capacity shortages and needs for the
program's implementation. Two long-term development objectives were identified for
the program: (i) improving the quality and access to core public services, and (ii)
facilitating growth and macroeconomic stability through selective and cost-efficient use
of public resources. In order to move towards these objectives, the program singles out
five main outputs summarized below. In designing the technicalities of the program, the
authorities emphasized the importance of budgetary management reforms as a necessary
condition for ensuring that public resources are better channeled to the intended
beneficiaries. Details of program components and specific measures are provided in the
annexed Letter of Development Policy and attached policy matrix.
45.   First output: improved budgetary programming. The government has decided
to engage the formulation of a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). Taking
into account the important capacity shortages which would constrain the rapid
implementation of an MTEF in Niger, the sequencing of its various building blocks has
been examined. At the central level, the tools for designing the macro framework are
being developed in the framework of the PRSP with the support of the Bank, to
meaningfully guide the subsequent determination of sector expenditure envelopes. At the
sectoral level, the Ministry of Education has initiated a pilot experience in launching the
preparation of a program-budget. This agency was deemed an appropriate candidate for
this endeavor, as it is finalizing with the assistance of the Bank a ten year strategy, using
a performance budgeting approach, in which inputs are linked to output and impact
indicators, with annual cost estimates integrating investment and recurrent spending. The
Ministry of Public Health has also expressed strong interest in program budgets.
However, limited absorption capacity does not allow introducing this approach in all
major spending agencies in the very short-term. Recognizing that an MTEF only makes
sense if it covers all (or a vast majority of) the budget, the Government has decided, as a
first step, to engage in a medium-term programming discussion with all the main
ministries, even if only on the basis of limited information at the beginning. Also, the
Bank team has shared with the government experiences learned from MTEF processes
elsewhere in Africa, the main lesson being perhaps that the MTEF approach only appears
to have an impact if it is accompanied by deep-rooted reforms in the execution process.
The government's program seeks to adequately respond to this finding as it includes the
deepening of reforms for budget execution as another central component of the program
(see below).
46.  In addition to medium-term programming, the Government also intends to
improve annual budget formulation through a series of targeted actions. In particular, a
census of students receiving scholarships is being carried out to improve the



- 19-
budgetization of these transfers. Also, autonomous public agencies receiving subsidies
are now required to present financial statements and budget proposals to better guide the
allocation of subsidies. A vast program of budget nomenclature reform is also being
implemented, not only to bring the Nigerien nomenclature in line with WAEMU
guidelines, but foremost to establish an improved framework for budgetary monitoring
and tracking in line with local needs and realities.
47.   Second output: improved expenditure process. The measures envisaged under
this component relate to the streamlining of expenditure management procedures, in
order to simplify processes while improving the performance of ex ante and simultaneous
control. It is expected that a simpler expenditure chain will remove existing incentives to
circumvent it. To this end, the government will establish a working group to review and
synthesize the various recommendations made by technical assistance missions, notably
from the IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department, and from the recently completed systemic and
financial audits undertaken by the European Union, to make its own diagnosis of the
situation and set up an action plan for reform. It is foreseen that the diagnosis work will
feed into a Public Expenditure and Management Review (PEMR), and provide an
opportunity to consolidate the findings from the PEMR with the Bank's scheduled
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA). It is expected from this dialogue
that the Government's involvement from the onset will provide substantial input into the
CFAA as well as foster client ownership of the CFAA's recommendations.
48.   To accompany these reforms, the FMIS will be further expanded upstream
(expenditure managers in line agencies) and downstream (the Treasury). Liquidity
management will be improved by formalizing the production of rolling cash management
plans. The process for committing and recording deconcentrated expenditures will be
simplified by delegating some routine responsibilities while improving the transmission
of key data from the regions.
49.   Public Procurement Reform. In response to the 1998 Country Procurement
Assessment Report (CPAR) and their own assessment, the Nigerien authorities have
launched the process to design and implement an action plan for public procurement
reform. Targeted areas for reform include the revision of the legal and regulatory
framework, with a view of bringing it in harmony with modem, internationally accepted
practices, including the sub-regional guidelines which are being developed by the
WAEMU Commission. Driving principles of the reform will be the elimination of
discriminatory practices and equitable treatment for all participants, increased
transparency and accountability, and the development of sound competition around
public contracts. In addition, the program will focus on institutional reform, including
increasing the efficiency of the national structures responsible for managing public
procurement by redefining their organization, mandate, and bring about better
enforcement of procurement regulations. To this end, the Government will develop tools
such as standard bidding document for goods, works and services. Public procurement
will be subject to regular external audits and a complaint mechanism will be established.
Transparency will be fostered by the publication of information bulletins on procedures,
open bids and contract awards. Finally, the program will need to provide adequate
training for staff involved in managing public procurement. As an immediate first step,



- 20 -
the Government will establish a reform steering committee including representatives
from the private sector and civil society. The government has also initiated dialogue with
external partners, including the Bank, requesting assistance for the preparation and
implementation of the action plan.
50.   Domestic arrears settlement. The large stock of domestic arrears continues to
burden the day-to-day execution of the budget. The government has set the resolution of
this problem as a key measure to restore credibility to public finances in the eyes of the
private sector and even civil servants. Building upon the technical work undertaken
previously, the government has prepared a plan for domestic arrears clearance which
defines settlement modalities and a program of domestic arrears priorities within the
financial constraints provided by the macro-financial framework. First settlement
payments under the plan have been initiated in 2001 and are expected to gain momentum
towards the end of the year and in 2002.
51.   Third output: expenditure accounting, reporting and evaluation. A new chart
of accounts will be introduced, consistent with the WAEMIJ guidelines, and which will
facilitate the reconciliation of cash and accrual data. Templates for regular budgetary
reports will also be designed to meet the needs of decision-makers, partners in
development, the media and the general public. The reforms which started in the
Treasury in order to restore accounting discipline will be deepened and strictly enforced.
The government has also requested support from the Bank to undertake the PEMR, which
would include a systemic assessment of procedures as mentioned earlier, in addition to an
analysis of pattems in public spending over the last four years for the whole budget.'5 In
addition, the government has requested technical assistance for the implementation of
pilot tracking surveys and beneficiary incidence analysis included in the program.
52.   Fourth output: restoring accountability. The process of completing and orderly
closure of budgetary accounts and submitting budget execution to the oversight of the
parliament and the Audit Office (Chambre des Comptes) of the Supreme Court will be
strengthened. As a first step, the Government has offered a panel of local experts from
which the Audit office will choose counselors to undertake a first audit of public
accounts. It is expected that a first draft audit report would be completed in the first half
of 2002. Particular attention will be paid to further reinforcing the capacity of the Court
to regularly perform its oversight mandate, notably through mobilizing the technical
assistance needed to that end.
53.   Fifth output: improve the management of human resources for the provision
of quality services. The budgetary management of human resources is being reformed to
allow for a better response to actual needs, especially in rural areas, through the
decentralization of budgetary positions. The integrated civil services database, which has
been operational since July 2000, will be used to streamline the cumbersome system of
indemnities. A new civil service statute will be adopted and implemented with the view
to introducing quality considerations in the provision of public services and establishing
15 This task has been included in the AAA program for Niger in FY02.



- 21 -
corresponding performance incentives. New avenues for the decentralized recruitment of
contractual personnel will be explored, by drawing lessons from the experience in the
education sector (see below).
B. Social sector reforms for an improved delivery of basic social services
Recent achievements and outstanding issues
54.   Education. During the last two decades, school enrollment and the efficiency of
the school system have stagnated and Niger has been falling steadily behind its neighbors
in those areas. Gross primary enrollment rates have only recently surpassed 30 percent,
remaining substantially behind average rates prevailing in sub-Saharan Africa. Internal
efficiency of the system is low, as grade repetition is widespread, especially at the end of
the primary and secondary cycles. Wide disparities exist between girls and boys and
between children in urban and rural areas. External efficiency is also inadequate as many
students completing tertiary education or vocational training fail to find employment. In
order to revive the development of primary education, reforms have been initiated since
the mid-1990s, mainly addressing supply side constraints on schooling, including the
construction and rehabilitation of classrooms as well as the reallocation of budget
appropriations in line with recommendations of the sector expenditure review. While still
insufficient at around 13 percent of total expenditure (or 2.1 percent of GDP), non-wage
budgetary allocations for basic education have increased gradually over the past few
years. Among the measures that have shown great promise are innovative delivery
mechanisms to address the issue of teacher shortage, while keeping payroll costs
sustainable. A program for hiring "volunteer teachers" introduced in 1998, resulted in
substantially lower costs.'6 This development explains the decrease in related salary
spending over the last couple of years.
55.   Health. Niger's poor health indicators result from  the high prevalence of
communicable and parasitic diseases, poor nutrition, one of the highest fertility rates in
the world, inadequate access to safe water and sanitation, and low levels of literacy and
education, especially for women. The unreliable supply and high cost of generic essential
drugs, especially for the rural population, further discourages the use of existing health
care centers. Preventive and curative health delivery mechanisms have had only limited
success in responding to health care challenges thus far. The objectives of the first
comprehensive policy statement for the health sector and a corresponding implementation
plan for the period 1994-2000 included the decentralization and reorganization of the
health system; the improved management of sector resources; the wider availability of
health services; increased monitoring of sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS;
immunization; and the improved availability and management of essential generic drugs.
16 In the volunteer teacher program, supported by IDA, primary school teachers are recruited among the
large pool of unemployed or underemployed young graduates and offered medium-term contracts with the
communities. They are subsequently enrolled in training programs. The program has received the active
support of regular civil service teachers.



- 22 -
56.   Thus far implementation of the health plan has culminated in a number of
achievements. Both the quality and the coverage of basic health care improved with
considerable investment in rehabilitation works, training, quality assurance and essential
generic drugs and with the construction of 157 integrated health centers (primary health
care facilities) around the country. The population living within 5 kilometers of a health
center has increased during the Plan period from 32 percent to 47 percent. Access to
first-level referral and surgical services has expanded thus providing a critical input to the
reduction of high levels of maternal mortality. Achievements in improved quality are
reflected in modestly increased utilization rates. Application of Niger's cost recovery
law and capacity building of ONPPC (drug procurement agency) have resulted in
improved availability of essential drug stocks in health facilities, although further
improvement is needed. Decentralized strategic sector management is improving and
health public expenditure reviews are carried out rigorously and routinely, through a
participatory process, and are linked to the budget preparation process. Communities,
NGOs and other local partners are becoming more assertive in their participation in the
management of health services and local revenues from cost recovery; and small scale
contracting (partnerships) between districts and local partners for health are
demonstrating high cost-effectiveness and innovation in contributing to the
implementation of district health plans.
57.   HIV/AIDS. The emergence of HIV/AIDS is another major health and
developmental challenge facing the Nigerien population. Although the official prevalence
rate of below 2 percent is low in comparison with other sub-Saharan countries, partial
indications would suggest that HIV/AIDS is now expanding rapidly and that the official
estimate no longer provides an accurate baseline. Although the National Program for the
Fight against HIV/AIDS (PNLS) was established over a decade ago and benefited from
the financial support of the Bank and other donors, its performance has fallen far short of
what is needed. During the year 2000 the Head of State approached the Bank to request
financial and technical support under the Multi-country HIV/AIDS Program (MAP)
operation to assist Niger in the conception and implementation of a viable HIV/AIDS
program.  To demonstrate Govermment commitment as well as to facilitate a
multisectoral approach to HIV/AIDS prevention and control, the PNLS was taken out of
the Ministry of Health and relocated to the Office of the President and is closely followed
on behalf of the President by a Minister/Adviser for HIV/AIDS.
58.  In line with the Africa Region's policy on HIV/AIDS, the Bank, in partnership
with other donors, has responded to the Government's request both through immediate
action to prepare a MAP operation, and through the rapid development of HIV/AIDS
interventions for all projects in its portfolio. For example, the upcoming Community
Action Program is supporting analytical work on the epidemic and on the response to
date at the community level, and has included HIV/AIDS activities in its pilot phase. The
Education operation is supporting an action plan for HIV/AIDS prevention conceived by
the Ministry of Education.   The mid-term  review  of the transport operation
accommodated the financing of an HIV/AIDS action plan prepared by the Ministry of
Transport. The health operation has restructured the HIV/AIDS component to respond to
evolving challenges, including the financing of small contracts to support local level
initiatives.

The social sector policy frameworkfor 2001-2003
59.   Education. The government is finalizing its 10-year development plan which
establishes ambitious targets to be reached in 2012: increasing the gross primary
enrollment to 70 percent (68 percent for girls and 65 percent in rural areas), reducing
repetition rates by two thirds, and increasing the adult literacy rate to 38 percent. In terms
of intra-sectoral priorities, basic education will be the foremost priority of the program,
including primary education and literacy programs. As a strategic means to attain these
objectives the government also intends to further promote the delivery of education
services outside government, e.g. through community schools or the private sector. In
particular, the private sector's share is expected to rise to 20 percent of total student
population in the secondary cycle. Sector reforms envisaged also include the
establishment of monitoring mechanism to evaluate access equity, reform of the teacher's
training program, reform of curricula and testing methods to boost internal efficiency,
further strategic reallocation of public resources towards rural areas, expanding the
volunteer teacher program, the adoption of special measures to promote girls' schooling
through advocacy, information and communication programs involving local opinion
leaders and school-level management committees, and the decentralization of service
delivery for primary schooling to local communities and the delegation of authority to
adapt the school calendar and curriculum to suit local conditions.
60.   Since 1996, the education program has received the support of an IDA sector
investment credit which will close at the end of calendar 2001. In 2002, the Government
intends to finance through budgetary resources critical expenditures which were financed
by the IDA operation. In particular, the national budget will take over the financing of the
following expenditure items:
*  The recruitment and training costs of new contractual teachers;
*  The salaries of all existing contractual teachers;
*  The subsistence costs of students attending the reformed teacher's colleges;
*  The costs linked to the expansion of double-shift teaching in urban areas;
*  The costs related to monitoring and evaluation of the program including the
collection and compilation of statistical data, the continuous undertaking of
public expenditure reviews, as well as of an expenditure tracking survey.
The government intends to seize this very important opportunity to demonstrate its
commitment and capacity for a future transition towards programmatic lending.
61.   Despite notable progress achieved in health service coverage and quality since
1997, the remaining challenges and issues are considerable. Still less than half of
Nigeriens live within 5 kilometers of a health facility (the benchmark for accessibility).
Service quality and availability of essential generic drugs still fall short of what is needed
to ensure the adequacy and reliability of health service delivery. A more concerted effort
is being undertaken to improve unacceptably low vaccination rates. The quality, quantity
and allocation of human resources for health are lacking, as are resources for financing of
non-salary expenditures. Current allocation and utilization of scarce resources are neither
equitable nor cost-effective. Finally, while the strategic management capacity of health



- 24 -
districts has notably improved, that of the central level of MOH remains extremely weak.
The Government is in the process of revising its health policy and preparing a 10;-year
health sector development plan to improve the cost-effectiveness and impact of efforts to
achieve goals of improving health service coverage and quality, especially of priority
programs, such as immunizations, reproductive health, malaria, tuberculosis, and
HIV/AIDS/STIs. The draft policy and 10-year planning process include among the
strategic objectives: operationalization of the health district , stronger emphasis on
prevention, human resource management, improved partnerships with communities and
civil society, improved efficiency and equity in the allocation and utilization of sector
resources, and a multisectoral approach to health. In the framework of the 2002 budget,
the government intends to increase allocations for an adequate staffing of health centers,
particularly in remote areas. In order to avoid an exodus of staff to the capital, the
program foresees that new recruits would be hired at the local level and financed through
block grants from the national budget.
62.   HIV/AIDS. With the support of UN/AIDS and other key partners. the
government is undertaking analytical and strategic work with a view to developing a
policy and strategic framework for a proactive and multi-sectoral approach to the
HIV/AIDS crisis. A number of activities are underway to this effect. A strategic
planning workshop held in June 2001 succeeded in training a national team and in
launching a process to produce a strategic framework by end-September 2001 and an
operational plan by mid-November 2001. An epidemiological survey and a beneficiary
assessment should provide by end-2001 quantitative and qualitative data on which basis
target setting, monitoring and evaluation will be undertaken. A revision and fine-tuning
of the institutional/organizational framework for HIV/AIDS is being undertaken through
a consultative process that will ensure that roles, responsibilities and partnerships are
clearly defined and that all key actors and stakeholders will be fully implicated in
program design and implementation in line with their comparative advantages. The
elements of the fiduciary architecture of the program have been sketched out and will be
refined with a view to accommodating both rigor and flexibility in the channeling and
management of funds under the MAP operation and that of other financing sources.
63.   Poverty targeting. In order to further improve the equity and efficiency of public
expenditure and policies in general, the government is committed to update and expand
its knowledge of poverty and evaluate the impact of policies. To that end, the 2002
budget will include an allocation for a long due household survey, as well as other
sectoral monitoring mechanisms (such as the education tracking survey).
C. Structural Reforms to promote private sector-led economic growth
64.   Privatization and regulatory reform. In 2000, the authorities had initially
imparted new momentum to the privatization program, specifically the sale of the four
key public enterprises: NIGELEC (power), SNE (urban water distribution), SONITEL
(telecommunications), and SONIDEP (petroleum products importation). After some
delays, the terms and conditions for the privatization of NIGELEC were finalized,
consisting in a concession arrangement for the production, import, and distribution of
electricity. Potential buyers for SONITEL and SNE were invited to come forward and



- 25 -
the successful sale of two cellular telephone licenses was completed. Finally, the strategy
for the privatization of SONIDEP was adopted. While the divestiture from SNE was
completed in March 2001, the privatization of SONITEL encountered problems.
Because of insufficient information in the bidding documents, especially with respect to
the company's financial statements, no investor responded to the call for bids.
Subsequent work to improve the bidding documentation suffered delays over the last six
months, including because of internal resistances to the proposed reforms. Nonetheless,
the Government has set a new timetable and relaunched the process in mid-September
2001.
65.   Financial sector. A recent assessment undertaken jointly by the Government and
the Bank has outlined the extremely fragile situation of Niger's financial sectors. The
main outstanding issues hampering the sector's development include an unfavorable
environment where the state holds large payment arrears vis-a-vis the banking sector, as
well as an inadequate judicial framework, both in terms of legislation and enforcement.
Also, most commercial banks do not meet prudential standards, a situation mainly
attributable to low capacity in the sector. The financial sustainability of the insurance
companies and of the social security institution is also in jeopardy. Micro finance
activities are limited, uncoordinated and poorly supervised, and existing institutions are
financially fragile and vulnerable.  There is little opportunity for formal financial
intermediation outside the capital. Finally, the range of financial products is too narrow
to efficiently finance productive activities. In response to these many challenges, the
government has prepared a financial sector reform program which is summarized below
and described in the Letter of Development Policy. The Bank is considering supporting
the program through a technical assistance credit.
The structural reform policyframeworkfor 2001-2003
66.   Telecommunications. With respect to the mobile phone segment, a timetable of
June 2001 had been initially set for the two outside investors to begin operations.
However, given SONITEL's incapacity to cover the costs of the required interconnection
investment as well as the operators' own delays in installing their equipment, this
deadline was not met. The Government has reaffirmed its commitment to rapidly solve
this problem, and one licensee partially began operations in September 2001. With
respect to the privatization of SONITEL, the Government has taken the necessary steps to
irrevocably bring the company to the point of sale, starting with the renewed call of
interests to potential investors in September 2001, the organization of an investor data
room in early October and the invitation to submit financial offers made to qualified
investors soon after. Assuming the bidding process is successful, the choice of the
strategic investor will take place before year end.
67.   Power distribution. Preparatory work for the privatization (granting of a
concession) of NIGELEC is progressing as expected. The framework legislation is
expected to be adopted by the National Assembly, and the call for bids launched in the
latter part of 2001. It is expected that the concession would be granted to a private
operator in the first half of 2002.



- 26 -
68.   Petroleum products importation and distribution. The main reform priority in
this sector relates to the adoption of a transparent, flexible and automatic pricing
mechanism which occurred on August 1, 2001. The privatization of the state-owned
company which holds a monopoly on importing petroleum products (SONIDEP! will
take the form of an outright sale of its equity to pre-qualified investors active in the
sector. Given that the newly privatized company would retain the exclusivity on the
importation of petroleum products, preparatory work over the next months will focus on
establishing a regulatory framework which would ensure market-like pricing conditions
(in particular with respect to purchases of refined products and open market access for
new distributors). Another important issue to be resolved relates to SONIDEP's financial
health following the surge in world oil prices experienced in 2000. While consumers
absorbed part of the shock through two increases in the retail gasoline price, most of the
deficit was borne by the sector and in particular by SONIDEP. This issue has found an
initial resolution with the inclusion of the overhang from the negative stabilization in the
domestic arrears settlement plan.
69.   Financial sector reform: The proposed program will focus on the following six
areas: (i) improving the banking environment, including settling or restructuring the debt
overhang of the State vis-a-vis the banking sector and strengthening of the legal and
judiciary framework; (ii) strengthening the commercial banking system, through the
sound restructuring of two ailing state-owned commercial banks17, and capacity building
activities for human resources employed in the sector; (iii) restructuring of the four
insurance companies and capacity building of their staff; (iv) adoption of a microfinance
strategy and promoting decentralized financial intermediation throughout the country, in
which the savings and checking arm of the postal institution (ONPE) is expected to play
an essential role; (v) formulation of a general social security strategy, as well as the
restructuring of the current institution covering employees from the formal private sector
(CNSS); (iv) deepening of the financial sector, through the promotion of new lending
products, the development of lease financing and financial guarantees.
70.   Other important areas of structural reforms include the effective operation and
adequate funding of the Road Fund (CAFER), an autonomous agency established to
ensure routine maintenance of the Niger's network. In addition, efficiency in the transport
sector is still hampered by non-transparent queuing arrangements (tours de role) for the
provision of domestic passenger transportation as well as international freight transport.
The introduction of competitive mechanisms is called for to reduce the high costs which
penalize the competitiveness of the country.

IV. THE PROPOSED OPERATION
A. Credit rationale and timing
71.   The proposed credit will help the Government of Niger finance its poverty
reduction and economic reform program, in particular by reinforcing its budgetary
management reform effort. Given Niger's structural fiscal imbalances and the need for
medium-term support to the implementation of the reforms described above, the proposed
credit would provide a source of support to carry out important expenditure programs
such as for basic education and primary health care. In addition, the program
underpinning the credit would further enhance Niger's track record in terms of the
promotion of basic social service delivery and the development of a more productive
private sector economy. Finally, the expected substantial progress in improving the
framework for public finance management would allow the Bank to consider subsequent
support in the form of a series of programmatic operations such as Poverty Reduction
Support Credits. Although the first disbursement under this credit would happen in the
latter half of Niger's current fiscal year, the proceeds from the credit have been included
in the 2001 budget law approved by parliament, and will cover about 23 percent of the
financing gap for the year. Without the quick-disbursing financing provided by the credit,
the government's ongoing efforts to establish a track record of reforms and effectively
implement its poverty reduction program could be undermined by liquidity shortages and
the constraints of cash rationing.
72.   The proposed instrument is a Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC) rather than a
Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) for the following reasons:
-  The Government has yet to finalize its full Poverty Reduction Strategy. While
the Interim PRSP provided adequate guidance on overall policy orientations,
the preparatory work for the full PRSP will lead to a more comprehensive
document, reflecting a participatory consultation process, and will hence
constitute a more adequate framework for programmatic support.
*  The analytical underpinnings for the PRSC, as identified in the recently
finalized guidelines, still need to be completed in Niger. To a large extent, the
activities supported by this credit will facilitate this groundwork. In order to
foster ownership, it is proposed that the PEMR be as closely related as
possible to the fiduciary assessments of financial management (Country
Financial Accountability Assessment) as well as to public procurement
procedures. The reforms outlined above would also result in important
progress in the transparency of budgetary operations, throughout the budget
cycle, and hence provide a strengthened fiduciary framework for
programmatic lending. In terms of social and structural analysis, ongoing
work on the macroeconomic framework would result in a diagnosis of the
potential sources of growth for Niger and the implications for poverty
reduction. Knowledge on living standards will also be improved in 2002 with
the completion of the first household survey since 1993.



- 28 -
73.  In summary, this adjustment operation will support all the groundwork deemed
necessary for the introduction of effective programmatic lending in Niger. Also, the
proposed "budgetization" in 2002 of the education spending supported by a stand-alone
sectoral IDA operation until the end of 2001 will provide very useful lessons for the
design of a PRSC in Niger. Beyond the outstanding work described above, the multi-year
reform program underpinning this credit (described in the attached Letter of
Development Policy and the attached policy matrix) would provide an appropriate
framework for possible PRSC support.
B. Progress on triggers from the previous adjustment operation
74.   The Public Finance Recovery Credit identified four minimum requirements in the
areas of macroeconomic performance, fiscal management reform and structural reforms
for the consideration of further adjustment support from IDA. Progress on each of these
triggers is described hereafter and provides a sound set of prior actions for the approval
of the proposed credit.
(a) Satisfactory performance in the implementation of the macroeconomic and fiscal
program. As described above, macroeconomic performance has been altogether
satisfactory in 2000 and in the beginning of 2001. This assessment has been
confirmed by the successful completion of the first mid-term review of the PRGF
which was discussed and approved by the Board of the IMF on August 3, 2001.
(b) Continued progress in establishing transparency and accountability in fiscal
management. As a performance indicator, the proposed trigger identified the
formal closure of accounts for FY 1998 and the submission of the corresponding
Budget Review law to the National Assembly. This action has been completed by
the submission of the 1998 Treasury Accounts to the Supreme Court's Audit
Office. A similar process has also been completed for fiscal year 1999.
(c) Adoption of a domestic arrears settlement plan. The Plan has been adopted and
provides an adequate framework for domestic arrears settlement over the period
2001-2003. Quantitative targets for domestic arrears reduction laid out in the plan
are fully consistent with the objectives of the macroeconomic program supported
by the PRGF. The plan is summarized in paragraphs 25 to 28 of the Letter of
Development Policy (see Annex H).
(d) Progress in the liberalization of the telecommunications sector. The liberalization
of the mobile telephone market is completed with the two private sector licensees
fully operational on the ground since August 2001. Prior to Board presentation of
this Credit, the government issued final bidding documents for the sale of
SONITEL which include all the necessary information missing in the
unsuccessful initial bid, and invited qualified investors to submit financial offers.
75.   Other significant actions taken since September 2000. In addition to the
triggers described above, a number of actions have been completed since the presentation
of the predecessor Recovery Credit to the Board in September 2000, which should be



- 29 -
considered as further justifying the release of the first tranche of the proposed credit upon
effectiveness:
Bud-etarv management:
(a) The adoption of a supplemental budget law adequately incorporating HIPC
resources and proceeds from the telecommunications liberalization program (see
paragraph 19).
Social sector reforms:
(b) The adoption of measures to increase the internal efficiency of primary education
and limit repetition rates at the exit of the primary cycle (see paragraph 59 of this
President's Report and paragraph 116 of the Letter of Development Policy).
Structural reforms
(c) The successful privatization of water distribution company in urban areas through
the granting of a management license to a private sector operator (see paragraph
64).
(d) The introduction of an automatic, flexible and transparent pricing mechanism for
petroleum products (see paragraph 68).
(e) The adoption of a restructuring plan agreed to with the Bank to restructure the
postal financial institution (see paragraph 69 of the President's Report and
paragraph 142 of the Letter of Development Policy).
C. Tranche-release conditions
76.   Release of the second tranche of the proposed Credit will be conditional upon
satisfactory performance in macroeconomic management and in the overall
implementation of the program set forth in the Letter of Development Policy, particularly
with respect to structural reforms in the productive sector (such as the privatization
program and in the social sectors). In addition, specific tranche release conditions will
have to be met which focus on the fiscal reform program, sound budgetary outcomes in
2001, improved budgetary allocations for 2002, and important reforms for basic
education. In the area of fiscal reform, the specific conditions proposed are seen as
critical steps in improving the tracking and evaluation of public expenditure, as well as
improving the fiduciary framework and accountability of the public sector. The proposed
condition for the education sector aims at institutionalizing cost-efficient teacher
recruitment through a contractual model, while enhancing the quality of primary
schooling by reforming the training framework. The proposed conditions for the release
of the second tranche include:



- 30 -
Fiscal stability and budgetary outcomes for 2001
(a) The implementation of the Domestic Arrears Reduction Plan for 2001 according
to the quantified reduction targets and settlement modalities set forth in that plan,
and the non-accumulation of new domestic arrears in FY 2001.
(b) The orderly and timely closing of budgetary accounts for fiscal year 2001 in line
with prevailing legislation, as evidenced by the establishment of a final
consolidated balance sheet of the Treasury (Balance Genirale du Tresor).
Budgetary preparation and execution reforn
(c) The adoption by government of new budget and accounting nomenclatures in
early 2002, for the preparation and execution of the 2003 Finance Law.
(d) The adoption by the Government and submission to the National Assembly of a
revised draft public procurement code , which reinforces transparency and cost-
efficiency in the public procurement of goods and services.
(e) The preparation by the Supreme Court's audit office of a first draft audit report
for fiscal 1997.
Content and initial execution of the 2002 Finance Law
(f) Adequate allocations in the approved 2002 Finance Law for education, health,
HIV/AIDS and poverty monitoring as detailed in paragraphs 59 to 64 of the
Letter of Development Policy.'8
(g) Appropriate execution in the first quarter of fiscal year 2002 for the education and
health sectors, and in particular for the items listed under (f), as evidenced by a
joint report from the Ministries of Finance, Education and Public Health.
18 In particular, allocations will be adequate for: (i) the recruitment and training of 2550 new contractual
primary school teachers for the 2001-2002 school year and the payment of salaries of all 10,O00contractual
primary school teachers; (ii) the subsistence entitlement for 1,200 students to the teacher's college; (iii) the
recurrent costs of the pedagogical supporting units (Cellules d'animation pedagogiques CAPED); (iv) the
indemnities to compensate double-shift teaching in urban areas for at least 1,000 teachers; (v) the costs
related to the collection and analysis of data for the compilation of the education statistical yearbook, the
completion of the sectoral education PER and of a public expenditure tracking survey in the education
sector (vi) the deconcentrated recruitment of certified physicians, multipurpose nurses, midwives and
laboratory technicians for the staffing of all primary health care centers (Centres de Sante Integres, CSI),
existing and to be opened at the beginning of CY 2002, according to existing quality standards; (vii)
adequate counterpart funding for the health sector investment budget in 2002; (viii) the operating costs of
the steering unit of the HIV/AIDS program; and (ix) the costs of a household poverty survey.



- 31 -
Social sector reforms
(h) Revised statutes and programs of the teacher's colleges (Ecoles Nationales
d 'Instituteurs, ENI) and adoption of a teacher recruitment policy institutionalizing
exclusively contractual recruitment for teaching positions in primary schools.
77.  In course of the preparation of a follow-up adjustment operation in FY 2003,
(possibly a PRSC), progress will be monitored in key reform areas of the program. In
particular, the program's measures in the social sectors envisage improved outcomes in
terms of higher primary enrollment rates, lower repetition rates, expanded primary health
care coverage, increased availability of essential drugs and higher immunization rates.
With respect to fiscal management, performance will be evaluated, inter alia, in terms of
keeping the fiscal and macroeconomic program on track, further satisfactory execution of
the 2002 budget, such as compliance with budget allocations, especially for social
sectors, achieving progress in public expenditure reforms or marked progress in the
privatization and financial sector reform programs.
D. Link to the CAS
78.   The current Niger CAS was discussed by the Executive Directors in 1997 and
identified three priorities for IDA support, namely (i) the development of human
capacities inter alia through expanded and improved delivery of basic social services; (ii)
the improvement in the management of water resources; and (iii) the promotion of
Niger's openness to its external environment, notably through private sector
development. Given the persisting predominance of State involvement in Niger's
economy, and the need to improve Government's role to reach the objectives laid out
above, the CAS further identifies sound public finance management as a cross-cutting
prerequisite for socio-economic development. A CAS progress report is presented along
with the proposed credit to the Board, while a full CAS will be elaborated upon
completion of Niger's first full PRSP. Preliminary results from the consultation for the
progress report show that the 1997 CAS priorities remain largely valid. In particular, the
improvement of budgetary management is perceived to be perceived by various
stakeholders as a key cross-cutting element for the implementation of a sound poverty
reduction strategy.
V. CREDIT FEATURES
A. Credit amount, disbursement procedures and implementation arrangements
79.   The proposed operation amounting to US$70 million would be disbursed in two
tranches for the period 2001-2002, with the first tranche amounting to US$30 million
being released upon effectiveness, while the second tranche worth US$40 million is
expected to be disbursed in the first half of 2002 upon completion of the conditions
described above (see paragraph 76). This design is proposed because it would allow the
Bank to efficiently focus lending preparation in 2002 on the substantial preparatory work
needed for a possible PRSC, while providing support in 2002 that would be better phased
in with the borrower's own budget cycle and expenditure procedures. Generally, multi-



- 32 -
tranche operations have proven inadequate to address high political risk. However, in the
case of Niger, the cancellation of the Public Finance Reform Credit (PFRC) is mainly
attributable to the rather exceptional circumstance of the 1999 coup d'Etat. 19
80.   Disbursement. Proceeds of the credit will be deposited by IDA in a Central Bank
account at the request of the borrower. If, after deposit in this account, the proceeds of the
credit are used for ineligible purposes (i.e. to finance items imported from non-member
countries, or goods and services on the Bank's standard negative list), IDA will require
the Borrower to refund the amount to the Credit Account.
B. Benefits and risks
81.   The proposed operation is expected to help the implementation of poverty
reduction programs by (i) fostering macroeconomic and financial stability, (ii) improving
the management of public resources, leading to better channeling of resources to the
intended beneficiaries; (iii) addressing institutional development to improve public
service delivery.
82.   At this stage, four types of risks should be highlighted. First, the political risk
remains high despite recent developments. While the ruling coalition holds a fairly
comfortable majority in parliament, the influence of special interest groups remain strong
and the risk for (partial) policy reversals or slippages cannot be discounted. On the basis
of the actions taken since the beginning of 2000 however, the current Government has
demonstrated its commitment to the program and has started to establish a substantial
track record in this relatively short period of time, and considering the constraints on
resources. Implementation of the program described in the Letter of Policy Development
and initial implementation of the PRSP should consolidate political stability. However, at
this stage, the residual risk should still be considered as substantial. Second, given the
remaining shortcomings in the management of public resources, fiduciary risk should not
be overlooked. However, the program supported by this credit addresses fiduciary issues
up front. Ownership of the program is strong enough to provide sufficient comfort for the
mitigation of this risk, although only gradually over time. Third, capacity remains weak
throughout the administration. In order to address this risk, the Government has set aside
budgetary resources for capacity building and has established contacts with donors to
undertake the capacity building measures described in paragraphs 168 ff. of the Letter of
Development Policy. In addition, the IMF has recently established resident technical
assistance with terms of reference fully consistent with the program. Other donors,
including the French Cooperation and the EU are also providing resident support. The
fourth risk is that the macroeconomic and growth scenario may fail to materialize. While
the implementation of the program should facilitate growth, the actual attainment of the
targets lie largely outside the scope of the proposed operation, and the risk remains high.
This could lead to additional financing shortfalls as it would affect the level of domestic
resources, and possibly undermine the implementation of the poverty reduction prograrns.
19 For a detailed discussion of the lessons learned from the PFRC, see the operation's Implementation
Completion Report (ICR, Report No. 22453).



- 33 -
A variant of the risk to the macroeconomic framework relates to the adverse impact that
the expected post-September 11 global economic slowdown is likely to have on Niger's
2002 financing needs. The size of the proposed PEAC has factored in the likely impact
on Niger's financing requirements, and the Bank will encourage appropriate burden
sharing on the part of other donors. The final risk mentioned here relates to the country's
vulnerability to external shocks, especially droughts or rising energy prices, which may
disrupt the implementation of the program. Mitigation mechanisms have been established
to cope with extreme situation such as a major food crisis. In the longer run, rural
development programs, including those supported by IDA, are expected to reduce as
much as possible this type of vulnerability. A final risk relates to lagging or insufficient
aid flows to fill the remainder of the financing gap. The government's altogether positive
performance to date, and continued implementation of the program, is the prime
mitigation factor for this risk. The Bank is also maintaining a close dialogue with other
concerned development partners in order to promote adequate burden sharing.
84.   The risks are mitigated, where possible, by the design of the credit, and are
altogether outweighed by expected benefits. A decision not to proceed with the operation
would not only undernine the credibility of the reform program, but also jeopardize the
successful stabilization efforts realized since 2000.
VI. COLLABORATION WITH OTHER DONORS
83.   The reform program underpinning the proposed credit is fully consistent with the
macroeconomic program supported by the PRGF which was approved in December
2000. There is close collaboration between the Bank and IMF teams, notably in the areas
of common interest such as budgetary management and financial sector reform. The IMF
also focuses its intervention in the area of domestic revenue mobilization which is not
addressed by the proposed credit. The Bank and Fund team will continue to work in close
collaboration, particularly with respect to the monitoring and strengthening of the
fiduciary framework. IDA staff have also consulted closely with other major donors such
as the AfDB, the European Union and France, who are all providing budgetary assistance
as well as technical support to the budgetary management reforms.
VII. RECOMMENDATION
84.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

REPUBLIC OF NIGER
MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND THE ECONOMY
Niamey, September 14, 2001
The Minister
To
Ms. Antoinette Sayeh
Country Director for Niger
The World Bank - Washington
Subject: Letter of Development Policy
I am pleased to send you herewith the Letter of Development Policy Letter,
prepared by the Government of Niger to serve as an instrument to implement the country's
poverty reduction policy.
This letter, comes at a time when our country, after having adopted the Interim Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (IPRSP) in October has devoted itself to develop the full Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) with the participation of all the levels of the population.
In this regard, among the overall poverty reduction objectives which will be elaborated in
the full PRSP, the government has chosen to retain three main areas of intervention for this
Letter of Development Policy, namely:
*     ''The improvement in the management of public resources
*     The improvement in the coverage and quality of basic social services
*     The promotion of the private sector to enhance its contribution to economic growth.
The government is determined to implement with all the necessary rigor, the required
measures and actions to achieve these objectives set out in this Letter of Development
Policy, i.e. to consolidate and enhance the positive results of economic and financial
management in 2000/2001.
Therefore, this Letter of Development Policy, expresses the political commitment and
emphasizes public finance management , in particular with respect to public expenditure
and budgetary control, the structural reforms in the social sectors, and the traditional
structural reforms which aim at promoting private sector development and at strengthening
economic management with a view to ensure sustainable and high economic growth.
The fiscal management reform policy aims at a more efficient use of public resources, that
is, the improvement in the quality of the expenditure in view of reducing poverty. In this
respect, the policy will assure the equal access to quality public services, support to



- 58 -                           Annex H
economic growth and contribute to the financial stability. To achieve this, the ke) strategic
principles of reforms are:
*     The improvement of the planning and preparation of the budget so they reflect the
priorities of the poverty reduction policy and the macroeconomic objectives;
*     The rationalization of budget execution in order to strengthen the efficiency and
effectiveness of the use of budgetary resources;
*     The improvement in the recording, monitoring and evaluation of budget execution;
*     The timely closing of budgetary accounts and the restoration of legislative and
judicial oversight over budget execution by the National Assembly and the
Supreme Court's Chamber of Accounts;
*     The strengthening of the human resource management in view of improving the
quality of service delivery to the population.
From this perspective, the objectives of the budget 2002 focus on the following points:
*     The maintenance of the macroeconomic stability;
D     The improvement in public finance management;
a     The incorporation of poverty reduction objectives.
The policy to increase the coverage and the quality of basic public services (health,
education) will be focus on the following reform areas:
With respect to the health sector, (i) further decentralization of the health system,
(ii)improvement in the availability of resources and rationalization of their management,
(iii) expansion of the health service coverage, (iv)development of the partnership for
health, (v)improvement of the quality of care, (vi) fighting against diseases, (vii) supply of
essential drugs, traditional drugs, medical equipment, blood and its by-products, (viii)
reforming the hospital system, (ix)development of reproductive health, (x) promotion of
traditional medicine, (xi) development of health research, (xii) promotion of hygiene and
sanitation.
With respect to the education sector: (i) teacher recruitment, training and supervision
policy for primary education, (ii) training program in teacher colleges, (iii) private sector
participation in the delivery of education services, (iv) improvement in the quality of
education and vocational training, (v) revision of the current student testing system, (vi)
adoption and implementation of measures to limit repetition at the end of the primary
cycle, (vii)strengthening of local communities' responsibility in school management.
The private sector development policy mainly aims at the development of the economic
activities in the private sector, particularly production and processing in small and medium
scale enterprises which generate employment and income. In order to achieve these
objectives, the government has already carried out following actions: (i) revision of labor
code introducing wage flexibility and abolishing the public sector's monopoly in hiring or
terminating employment; (ii)creation of management support centers for new enterprises,
(iii) harmonization of the modernization of business laws in the framework of the
OHADA; (iv) launch of a vast program of reforms and privatizations of public sector



- 59 -                         Annex H
enterprises.
The government intends to pursue the process of reform particularly through stepping up
the actions to promote the private sector by: (i) creation of an enabling institutional and
legal environment providing the right incentives; (ii) the strengthening of the
organizational autonomy of the private sector, (iv)the valorization of local resources, (v)
the development of human, managerial, and technological resources; (vi) promotion and
the development of opportunities offered by regional integration; (vii) the rehabilitation of
the banking and financial sector; (viii) the modernization of judicial system, and (ix) the
continuation of the program of privatization and public enterprise restructuring.
The monitoring of the program spelled out in the Letter of Development Policy will be
assured by an by a monitoring mechanism established in the Ministry of Finance and the
Economy through an "Economic Management Support Group" (GAGE), established by
by-law N° 00374/ MF/DGER dated August 20, 2001.
In close collaboration with the concerned ministries, the GAGE is responsible for:
*     Preparing an Economic and financial report on Niger;
-     ''The management of economic and financial databases;
--    Statistical and economic analysis based on a macroeconomic model;
D     Giving technical support to the agencies dealing with the monitoring of economic
and financial programs
*     Carry out studies allowing a better understanding of the performances and the
perspectives of Nigerien economy.
The administrative capacity of Niger having considerably eroded over the past years in
terms of human and material capacity in all sectors, the government will solicit the
technical and material support form its partners in order to implement these reforms.
The Government counts on all its partners for mobilizing adequate external resources in
support of the reform timetable.
The most stringent needs for the support are most felt in the following areas:
macroeconomic management and public finance management, financial sector, social
sectors, and the update of the poverty knowledge base through the undertaking of a new
household survey in 2002.
These are, Madame the Director, the main features of the attached Letter of Development
Policy that I have the honor to share with you in the framework of the negotiations on the
new Public Expenditure Adjustment Credit, requested by my government to your
institution. Sincerely yours
Ali Badjo Gamatie
Minister of Finance

1. BACKGROUND, STRATEGY AND OBJECTIVES
Niger is a 1,267.000 square kilometers sahelo-saharan country, land locked in the center of
the continent. Its ten million population is facing considerable natural challenges, caused
by an increasingly dry climate, a strong population pressure and a very limited natural
resources base. With the nearest harbor more than a thousand kilometers away and lacking
railroad infrastructure, Niger's import and export are more expensive.
2.    In addition to an unfavorable natural environment, the country's economic growth and
improvement in the welfare of its population has been further constrained by adverse
economic, social and political circumstances during the 80 and 90. The collapse of the
uranium market, a debt crisis, armed rebellions, military coups, strikes, and others have
accelerated the extension and the deepening of poverty. Today, poverty is widespread in
Niger:
* The GNP per capita has dropped from US dollars 391 in 1975 to US dollars 269 in
1998;
* Life expectancy at birth is 48 years, one of the lowest in the world;
* The infant and juvenile mortality rates are 123 and 274 per thousand live births
respectively in 1998;
* Gross enrollment is one of the lowest in the world, 34.14 % in 1999/2000, with a
marked disparity between boys and girls. Enrollment rates were 44.49 % for boys and 26.9
% for girls in 1999/2000;
* Access to drinking water is less than 60 %;
* 63 % of the population live below the poverty line according to the 1989-1990
household survey.
3.    Given the extent of poverty, Niger has first designed and implemented a Poverty Reduction
Strategy based on a National Poverty Reduction Program, supported by the International
Community following a round-table with all development partners in Geneva in March
1998. Afterwards, building on the experience derived from the program, the Government
has embarked into the preparation of a poverty reduction operational strategy through a
process involving the participation of all stakeholders nation-wide.
4.    The output of a first step in this process is an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-
PRSP) that has become the Government's main development policy starting October 2000.
5.    The second stage, currently ongoing, has been launched in February 2001 at a national
workshop involving all key stakeholders in the country. Its output should be the adoption
of a full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). Once approved by Government, the
full PRSD will replace the interim strategy document.
6.    Prepared between the two steps of the PRSP process, the present letter of development
policy is designed to become an implementation instrument for the Government's poverty
reduction strategy as it is established in the I-PRSP. In that regard, among the overall
objectives of poverty reduction which the full PRSP will further develop, the Government
has centered its letter of development policy around three main lines:



- 62 -                             Annex H
* Improving public resources management;
* Extending the coverage and improving the quality of the basic social services;
* Promoting the private sector in order to improve its contribution to economic growth.
7.    The economic and financial policies from the 2000-2003 program, supported by the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and implemented by the Government, aim
at maintaining a stable macro-economic framework and thus to help achieve the kev
development objectives mentioned above. Noticeable progress has been accomplished on
several fronts during the first semester of 2001 through the careful implementation of the
following economic and financial stabilization measures:
* Separating year 2000 fiscal management from previous fiscal years, including a
temporary suspension of the payments of domestic arrears accrued up to December 31
1999 in order to verify the validity of payment claims;
* Creating a Center for the Amortization of Public Domestic Debt (Centre
d'Amortissement de la Dette Interieure de l'Etat, CADIE) that will be responsible for
implementing the settlement plan for domestic arrears;
* implementing a new control mechanism to better monitor the utilization of operating
budget appropriations;
* Eliminating exceptional practices in budget execution, particularly the advance
payment practice;
* Strengthening the routine monitoring of budget execution;
l Improving budget preparation by using more realistic assumptions on resources
mobilization;
* Increasing the autonomy of key public utilities (telephone, water, and electricity) that
are authorized to collect payments from public agencies using the same set of rules and
measures they use with private commercial customers;
* Restoring a process of formal closing of public finances account and parliamentary
control on budget execution by transmitting to the National Assembly for the firs time in a
decade the draft budget review laws for the 1997, 1998 and 1999 fiscal years;
* Restoring fiscal discipline in the bookkeeping of Treasury's operations.
8.    A scrupulous enforcement of these measures have helped achieve encouraging results, in
particular:
* Restoring timely salary payments in the civil service, leading to a progressive
resumption of work in public agencies, particularly in essential public services (education
and health);
* Improving the Government's credibility by ensuring timely settlement of suppliers
invoices, including bills from public utilities (electricity, water and telephone);
* Restoring macro-economic stability as confirmed by the conclusion of an agreement
with the IMF under the PRGF, by an agreement in December 2000 on the decision point
from the HIPC Initiative for Niger and by the approval in August 2001 of the PRGF-
supported program.
9.    Government is committed to scrupulously implement measures and actions needed to
achieve the objectives of the present letter of development policy, i.e. consolidating and
broadening positive results achieved in 2000/2001 with better economic and financial
management.



- 63 -                            Annex H
10.   Therefore, topics of the present letter of development policy, which is the expression of the
Government's political will, include first public finances policy, emphasizing in particular
public spending and budgetary control; second, structural reforms in the social sectors; and
third, other structural reforms classically used to promote the development of the private
sector and to strengthen economic management in view of a strong and sustainable
economic growth.
2. PUBLIC RESOURCES MANAGEMENT REFORMS
11.   Reference policy in the area of public resources management aims at a more efficient use
of public resources in order to reduce poverty. Therefore, public finance management
policies will:
  Insure equitable access to quality public services;
*  Support economic growth and contribute to financial stability.
12.   Government reforms will focus on five strategic areas:
a  Improving the programming and budget preparation in order to reflect poverty
reduction and macro-economic priorities;
*  Streamlining budget execution to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the use of
budgetary resources;
*  Improving the operation accounting, follow-up and evaluation of budget execution;
*  Timely closing of budget accounts and restoring legislative and judicial control of
budget execution by the National Assembly and the Supreme Court's Audit Office;
*  Strengthening human resources management to improve the quality of services
delivery to the population.
2.1.1. Budget planning and preparation
Context
13.   Current budget planing and preparation methodologies lack a medium term perspective and
do not allow for a broad enough integration of the poverty reduction objectives in the
budget. Moreover, several annual budget expenditures items are not formulated with the
appropriate level of economic and financial analysis, in particular the appropriation of
grants for public facilities, for students' scholarships and for the external debt service.
Obiectives and strateeies
14.   The Government is committed to modernize the way budget appropriations are prepared
and planned on the basis of economic and financial criteria consistent with the Medium
Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). Within the MTEF, medium term appropriations by
sector will be determined in conformity with the macro-economic framework.
15.   During the 2001-2003 period, program budgets will be prepared for the education, health,
rural development, and transport and infrastructure sectors.



- 64 -                              Annex H
16.    The reform will also improve the preparation of annual budgets through the use of criteria
resulting from the physical census of students and from the auditing of scholarships, both
finalized in 2001, as well as of performance contracts signed with key agencies operating
with public grants. Moreover, starting with the 2002 budget, greater emphasis will be given
to translating poverty reduction objectives into budget appropriations (see the following
paragraphs about the 2002 budget orientations).
17.   The budget planning and preparation can only contribute to a more efficient use of public
resources if there is appropriate monitoring and evaluation. Therefore, the Government will
put in place starting 2003 a new budget nomenclature and a new chart of accounts
consistent with international standard.
18.    To address some of the existing deficiencies, the Government will seek the support of its
development partners, in order to train officials on the use of the new instruments and to
acquire the necessary equipment to develop a model that will help to prepare a macro-
economic framework for economic and budgetary management and ensure on the long
term the definition of appropriate poverty reduction policies.
2.1.2. Streamlining budget execution to improve its effectiveness and efficiency
Context
19.   The first public expenditure reviews in Niger (health, education, rural sector) as well as
several audits on public finances have revealed, inter alia:
* The complexity of the budget expenditures process that makes control and monitoring
of budget execution very difficult if not inoperative;
 The need to extend computerization to the full budget expenditures process;
* The constraints caused by arrears to an effective management of public finances;
 The insufficient weight of cost effectiveness in public procurement criteria;
* Major deficiencies at the level of decentralized expenditures;
* The legacy of past crisis on the management of public finances.
20.    Public procurement is also an area where the current system is constrained by problems:
* Lack of clarity and simplicity in legal texts and legal and technical instruments
(bidding documents, absence of standard bidding contracts, lack of standard procurement
contracts etc.);
* Lack of clear and accurate evaluation criteria;
* Lack of compliance and misinterpretation of procedures;
* Lack of consistency among national regulations, decentralized procedures and rules
imposed by donors;
* Lack of professionalism among public procurement officers;
* Lack of a procurement code of ethics;
* Potential for corruption due to the lack transparency in procurement procedures, in
particular direct contracting;
* Over-invoicing and improper slicing and packaging.



- 65 -                             Annex H
Obiectives and strateaies
21.    The Government knows that a context of information system unable to generate reliable
infornation does not offer guarantees of quality for public expenditures. But it is
determined to make the improvement of public expenditures one of its top priorities.
22.    Therefore, the Government will:
a  Take measures to streamline the expenditures process system to control more
efficiently the management of public finances with the objective of having revised and
enhanced operational procedures for the 2003 budget execution;
*  Continue the installation of a financial information system that will make budget
execution data available in real time;
a  Improve budgetary regulations and cash management plans to enable the timely and
transparent payment of public expenditures.
23.    Determining criteria to monitor cost-effectiveness and transparency will be a key element
of the Government's procurement policy. These criteria as well as the harmonization of
procedures at the sub-regional level will shape the procurement reform. More specifically,
the reform will include the revision of the regulatory framework, the preparation and
implementation of a training program for procurement officers, the putting in place of an
instrument to monitor public procurement and, if needed, additional institutional reforms.
These different actions will all have as ultimate objective contracts awarded in full
transparency and on the basis of the lowest acceptable offer.
24.    Since 1995, the Republic of Niger has accumulated domestic arrears large enough to
become issues addressed by the then adjustment programs. The World Bank has provided
its financial and technical support to the settlement of these arrears on the basis of several
reports taking stock of the debt and domestic arrears.
25.   In 1997, the total debt outstanding and arrears amounted to FCFA 225 billions prior to
making effective an IDA reform credit. The largest part of these arrears were debt claims to
the financial sector (FCFA 70 billions) and to public and private suppliers (also CFA 70
billions, divided into FCFA 40 billions of held over invoices and FCFA 30 billions of
balances outstanding). On December 31, 1997, belated wage bills in the civil service
amounted to FCFA 17 billions.
26.   Between December 31, 1997 and December 31, 1999, the structure and amount of the
domestic debt have considerably changed. During this period as well as in 2000, the
Government has embarked in consultation with the Bretton Woods Institutions in a series
of actions to improve public expenditure management and to avoid further accumulations
of arrears.
27.    The execution of this policy adjustment has suffered from interruption and even reversal.
Actions aimed at settling accumulated arrears have also been taken, leading to the creation
of the CADIE, which is today the central executing institution for the arrears settlement
policy. The Government has also adopted an arrears settlement plan, defining settlement
priorities and modalities and providing quantitative targets consistent with the macro-
economic and financial program.



- 66 -                             Annex H
28.   The execution of this plan in 2001 should cause to disburse FCFA 34 billions using a
transparent mechanism to verify and validate the arrears to be paid in accordance with the
Government's strategy. This amount will be paid out as follows: FCFA 8 billions to settle
two months arrears in salary payments, FCFA 2 billions to repay the balance outstanding
on accounts payable inferior to FCFA 5 millions, FCFA 2.5 billions of advances to
reimburse commercial banks, FCFA 2.4 billions to repay the National Saving Institution,
FCFA 2 billions to partially correct the negative stabilization of the petroleum sector
originally paid by the SONIDEP and FCFA 17.1 billions to pay the debt claims from
private suppliers of the State.
29.   The Government is committed to prevent new accumulation of new arrears.
2.13. Accounting, monitoring and evaluation of budget operations
Context
30.   Recent years have seen deterioration in the quality of statistical information in Niger,
including Public finance data, which had for a long time received a privileged treatment.
Information is untimely and of uncertain quality. An cash shortage, an unstable political
social climate and an economic decline have led to the accumulation of arrears and to the
use of inappropriate practices such as payment advances and payment of invoices for
expenditures with no prior appropriation commitments. Theses practices have further
aggravated an already very difficult situation due to the lack of consistency between
different sets of statistical information: Typical budget documents (Budget, Tax collection
statement, Treasury's overall balance), the Government Financial Operations tables and
since 1991 following severe difficulties, the State's cash management plan.
31.   In normnal times when there is enough liquidity at the Treasury, the Treasury pays
expenditures within 48 hours upon their reception. Since Niger's cash position has become
difficult, authorized expenditures are paid according to the cash at hand in the Treasury, a
situation that has led to the accumulation of arrears in the State's creditors payments.
32.   In sum, during several years, the bookkeeping of budget operations has been hampered by
these new practices in budget execution. Therefore, since its inception in January 2000, the
Government has taken necessary measures to disconnect the fiscal year 2000 budget
management from previous fiscal years in order to facilitate the return to normal budgeting
and accounting management.
33.   With respect to budget evaluation and execution analysis, the Government has undertaken
since 1997 public expenditures reviews in the health, education and rural development
sectors, which have produced financial analyses and have improved the monitoring and
quality of public expenditures in these sectors. However, because of their sector nature and
their limited scope, they have not produced an evaluation of the economic and physical
impact and a global analysis of public expenditures.
Obiectives and strateeies
34.   A Transparent monitoring of budget execution should be a key ingredient of good public
accounting procedures. Therefore:



- 67 -                             Annex H
* A revised chart of accounts, consistent with regional directives, will be adopted and
implemented;
* Reliable tools to monitor budget execution will be prepared regularly to better inform
the decisions of policy makers;
* Fiscal discipline in the bookkeeping of Treasury's operations will be strengthened;
* A public expenditures review covering the entire budget and its management
procedures will be prepared and its recommendations implemented;
a Pilot surveys to physically and financially track expenditures and assess their impact
among the beneficiaries of public services will be carried out on a pilot basis.
35.   Moreover, for decentralized budget appropriations, the Government will adopt a more
efficient payment mechanism that will enable appropriation commitment and payment to
be recorded in accordance with regulations and the data for this expenditure category to
become available with the other public expenditures.
2.1.4. Closing of accounts
Context
36.   For more than a decade, Niger's budget system has not created the official documents
needed to close the fiscal year and all of its budget accounts, in particular the budget
review laws (loi de reglement) and management accounts used by the Supreme Audit
Office to produce an external evaluation of the budget execution.
37.   The interruption in the production of these documents mirrors a deterioration in the
working capacity of administrations responsible for producing these documents and the
emergence of questionable budget practices that have contributed to a deterioration of the
accounting record system and hence the loss of its internal consistency and logic.
38.   However, in the context of putting the public finances straight starting year 2000, the
Government has drafted budget review laws and management accounts for the 1997, 1998
and 1999 fiscal years.
Obiectives and strateLzies
39.   Closing the accounts is a mandatory step in the budget process that must normally lead to
an external audit, the parliamentary and jurisdictional control.
40.   To that effect, the Government is committed to continue the production of past budget
review laws and management accounts restored in 2000 with the 1997 fiscal year budget
review law, and to routinely produce these documents starting with fiscal year 2001 which
together with the fiscal year 2000 documents will be transmitted in 2002 to the National
Assembly and to the Supreme Audit Office. The later should produce it first closing
ordinance during 2002. On that base, it is expected that the National Assembly start
organizing parliamentary debates on budget execution in the course of 2002.
41.   However the lack of human and material resources in the agencies responsible for
producing theses documents will impose the mobilization of external technical and



- 68 -                             Annex H
material support to carryout this commitment. To that effect, the Government will contact
its partners to obtain the necessary support in the areas of staff training, technical
assistance and equipment for data collection and processing, communication and travel.
2.1.5. Improving the quality of human resources in the civil service
42.   The overall objective in reforming the civil service is to insure a quality civil service
accessible throughout the national territory by making available to key public services the
human resources they need to operate properly. The following objectives are being
pursued:
 Improve the effectiveness of the public service;
 Control the number of staff and the wage bill in the civil service;
* Better utilize civil servants;
* Improve the quality of public services delivery.
43.   To achieve these objectives, the Government has launched a civil service reform program
with the following component: (i) reform of the system of remuneration and promotion,
including a review of social benefits and the introduction of a career planning system; and
(ii) right-sizing the civil service, including the reallocation of staff to priority sectors, the
decentralization of budgetary positions, the implementation of an integrated (wage and
position) civil service database and as a voluntary departure program. By 2001, the
Government has decided that the total budget appropriation for all recruitment including
those to meet staff needs in education (with the exception of the volunteer teachers), health
and in the financial authorities will not exceed savings realized from staff departures
outside the voluntary departure program.
44.   The Government is committed to pursue the implementation of the strategies detailed
above while promoting and developing a quality-oriented culture within the public service.
2.2. OTHER REFORMS WITH BUDGET IMPLICATIONS
2.2.1. Decentralization
45.   Government's policy on decentralization will rest on greater accountability and
involvement of concerned communities in expressing their needs and in implementing
recommended solutions.
46.   The following objectives will be pursued:
* Deepening, strengthening and consolidating democracy and governance at the local
level;
 Bringing Government's services closer to the public;
* Creating homogeneous poles of economic, social and cultural development;
* Making communities more accountable in the promotion of local development.



- 69 -                             Annex H
47.   These objectives will be achieved with the following strategies:
*  Better definition of institutional boundaries and establishment of all decentralization
levels on the ground;
*  Effective empowerment of local governments;
*  Promoting decentralized cooperation and strengthening of community level
partnership;
*  Developing financial, human and material capacity at the local level;
* Organizing free and transparent elections at the different level of local governments;
  Designing a monitoring and evaluation mechanism of local governments.
48.   In collaboration with the National Assembly, the government has engaged into a long
consultation process with the objective to define a territorial division of the country that
allows decentralization to be as extensive as possible given the resources available while
being best suited to the needs of the country. The process should lead to a wide consensus
on the number and limitations of regions, departments and communes.
49.   Government will pursue the reform effort, in particular with: (i) the adoption and
implementation of a decentralization legal framework; (ii) organization of elections at the
local level and establishment of communes, departments and regions; (iii) organization of a
roundtable on decentralization; (iv) training of elected officials and communities with
respect to local management and to the institutional and legal framework of the
decentralization; (v) finalization of regional guidelines for territorial administration.
50.   The results of this process should include:
*  Financially autonomous administrative entities with their own legal status;
*  Elected legislative bodies;
*  Business at the local level distinct from that of the State and managed by local
communities.
2.3 ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PRIORITIES FOR 2002
51.   The 2002 budget reflects Government's objectives spelled out in the Prime Minister's
Statement of General Policy and in the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy document.
They fall into three major areas:
*  Maintaining macroeconomic stability;
*  Improving public finances management;
*  Integrating poverty reduction objectives in the Budget.
2.3.1. Improving the macroeconomic framework
52.   The 2002 budget's objective will be to steer Government's actions towards a strong and
sustainable growth, which is a prerequisite for poverty reduction. Therefore, the approach
is to restore macroeconomic and financial equilibrium by pursuing the following
objectives:



- 70 -                            Annex H
*  Increasing GDP growth to 4.1% in 2002;
 Keeping inflation under 3% in 2002;
* Increasing the level of investment to 13.8% of GDP in 2002.
53.   Key 2002 budget aggregates will be consistent with the targets in the economic and
financial program supported by the PRGF. Therefore, the level of revenues and
expenditures are forecasted to be FCFA 144.2 billions and 269.5 billions respectixely,
representing an annual increase in revenues of 13.2% and in expenditures of 8%, which
translate into a lower total budget deficit, from 8.9% of GDP in 2001 to 8.2% in 2002. The
wage bill, another key target in the program, will not exceed FCFA 50.3 billions in 2002.
54.   In executing the 2002 budget, Government will aim at:
* Creating an institutional environment promoting economic development;
* Continuing the implementation of poverty reduction strategies by improving the
impact of public investments on the standards of living of the population, in particular
through cost effective budget allocations in health, education and rural development; and
by promoting small and medium scale enterprises;
s Strengthening the integration of the national economy into the regional economy
through WAEMU and ECOWAS.
2.3.2. Improving public finances management
55.   During 2002, Government will continue the implementation of realistic budget policies by
keeping expenditures within the limits of available resources and by allocating
expenditures in a way that ensure a broader access by the population to quality public
services.
56.   The following measures will be put in place to achieve this goal:
* Making optimal use of the potential offered by the Unique Fiscal Identity Number to
reduce tax evasion;
* Controlling and reducing tax exemptions by strictly enforcing exemption control
measures related to public procurement in externally financed project that were made
effective in May 1998;
* Reestablishing the automatic sending of delinquency notice to delinquent taxpayers;
* Strengthening the monitoring of major taxpayers;
* Broadening and better controlling the tax base by identifying and managing better tax
households;
*  Implementing strategies to tax the informal sector;
* Improving revenue collection by strengthening the tax administration with appropriate
staffing and equipment.
57.   A key objective with respect to public expenditures is to improve the quality of
expenditures. To that effect, the following measures will be implemented:
* Compliance with budget and accounting regulations, including stock records keeping;
* Controlling and restructuring expenditures in accordance with past public expenditure
reviews and audits recommendations;
* Improving the management of the public debt;
* Settlement of domestic and external arrears;



- 71 -                             Annex H
  Avoiding accumulation of new arrears through strict observance of fiscal discipline;
* Continuing the rehabilitation and modernization of public finances management;
*  Continuing the rationing in the use of water, power and telephone services by public
agencies;
.  Pursuing efforts undertaken to control the wage bill, in particular with a better
utilization of civil servants and wages integrated file.
2.3.3. Key orientations of the 2002 budget
58.   The Government is committed to a budget proposal consistent with the poverty reduction
objectives.
59.   To that effect it will introduce in the 2002 budget specific measures in the areas of health,
education and poverty statistics, translating its strong commitment to work towards poverty
reduction and to update the knowledge base on poverty to better orient policy making. This
exercise will be carried out in full compliance with the macroeconomic and financial
program described in paragraph 53 above.
60.   EDUCATION. The 2002 Education budget will cover new expenditures formerly paid out
of the Fundamental Education Sector Project which will close on December 31 2001 in the
context of a transition towards a program budget approach. Therefore payment of these
expenditures by the national budget is a pilot test for such an approach.
61.   The corresponding budget allocations will finance in priority: (i) allowances paid to at least
10000 Education Volunteers (EV) in the form of transfers to communities; (ii) allowances
paid to 1200 students in teachers colleges; (iii) double shift bonuses for at least 1000 school
teachers; (iv) implementation of education quality improvement strategies through the
strengthening of CAPEDs and a reduction in the repetition rate in particular at the exit of
the primary school level; (v) producing indicators to monitor the education policy; (vi)
tracking and reviewing public expenditures.
62.   HEALTH. Health priorities are: (i) to make up for insufficient resources in basic health
facilities by appointing the following personnel to the Integrated Health Centers at the first
and second level of the health system and to district hospitals (existing as well as those
which will open early 2002): 22 doctors, 174 registered nurses, 76 registered midwives,
145 laboratory technicians as well as hygiene and sanitation technicians, and 129 certified
nurses, their contracts being strictly limited to the designated positions and signed with the
local governments concerned; (ii) to ensure availability of counterpart funds for health
projects in the budget. To meet these staff requirements, funds will be transferred to local
governments (districts) for which needs have been identified following the 2001 health
personnel census.
63.   HIV/AIDS. The pandemic is expanding in Niger. To face this expansion, Government will
develop a multisectoral strategy to combat the disease building on the existing National
VIH/AIDS Program (NVAP). To that effect, the 2002 budget will cover all NVAP
operational costs for an amount totaling FCFA 75 millions.
64.   UPDATING THE KNOWLEDGE BASE ON POVERTY. To update statistical
information and knowledge on poverty, Government will allocate funds in the 2002 budget
to finance a National Budget and Expenditure Household Survey (NBEHS) as it remains
the best source of data to determine the actual situation, determinants and evolution path of



- 72 -                              Annex H
poverty. It should be noted that the last NBEHS the results of which are used by current
studies on poverty dates back to the early nineties.
65.   In the context of the new budget monitoring system, a report on budget execution
focussing on the above budget measures will be produced at the end of the first quarter in
2002. The Ministry of National Education and the Ministry of Public Health will validate
the report.
3. POLICIES TOWARDS IMPROVING THE COVERAGE
AND THE DELIVERY OF BASIC PUBLIC SERVICES
3.1 HEALTH SECTOR
Context
66.   In July 1995, Niger has adopted a Health Sector Policy Statement following the
formulation of a National Drug Policy in March of the same year. The key objective in the
Health Sector Policy Statement was to improve health and nutrition of individuals, families
and communities by centering the sector strategy on the strengthening of Health Districts.
This approach was implying the development of prevention and health promotion activities
to be integrated to curative health care and to coordinated cross-sector activities in the
context of a managerial process.
67.   An assessment of its implementation has shown that many positive results have been
achieved. A legal framework has been elaborated and adopted, covering the areas of
reproductive health, nutrition, health education, health costs recovery, generic essential
drug procurement, hygiene and sanitation; as well as the effective implementation of
health districts with structured participation of communities and establishment of health
committees.
68.   In spite of these achievements, most health indicators have not showed significant
changes, with the exception of the physical health coverage rate that has increased from
32% in 1994 to 47 .6% in 2000 and infant and juvenile mortality that has decreased
significantly, from 31 8%o to 274%o.
69.    The health sector is still facing major issues, including:
* Precarious nutritional status of the population;
* Persistence of communicable diseases, epidemic and often fatal, in particular for
children;
* Expansion of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and sexually transmitted infections;
* Inequitable access to health care and services between urban and rural population,
between the poor and the rich primarily due to difficulties in the access to drinking water
and sanitation in rural areas;
a Under-equipment and obsolescence of hospital facilities;



- 73 -                              Annex H
Irregular drugs supply.
70.   In the face of such evidences, change is imperative in order to guarantee a right to good
health to the vast majority of the people in Niger, and therefore to contribute to poverty
reduction.
Strategies
71.   In the context of its strategies focussing in priority on poverty reduction, Government will
keep giving a higher priority to prevention through information and awareness raising
campaign, improving sanitary conditions, increasing the coverage of immunization
campaigns and reorienting investments towards increased access to health services
throughout the country. Reproductive health in Woman and child health strategy
components, family planning as well as AIDS and sexually transmitted infections will all
receive special attention.
72.    With respect to drugs, priority will be given to making generic essential drugs available to
the population, improving the production and supply systems of these drugs.
73.    Moreover, the poor will continue to benefit from the national solidarity in sharing health
costs in an equitable manner.
74.    Health infrastructure investments foreseen in Health Development Plans will be
implemented to ensure a better decentralization and to bring population closer to health
services. The major strategic pillars of the above reforms are:
a) Continuing the decentralization of the health system
75.    The decentralization of the health system will result in a more equitable distribution, better
management and control of resources allocated to health as local decision-makers are made
more accountable. In this context, budget items will be regionalized and budget allocations
will be determined at the level of health district on the basis of performance and outcomes.
b) Improving the availability and management of material resources
76.    A more equitable distribution of available equipment will be achieved through appropriate
criteria and the definition of standards and quotas reflecting the status of health facilities.
The construction and equipment of village health centers, Integrated Health facilities and
District Hospitals will be pursued. Health facilities technical equipment will be improved
and renewed to better respond to the expectations of the population. Infrastructure and
equipment will be brought up to date and rehabilitated. Equipment management procedures
will be effectively implemented. More thoughts will be given to the restoration of the
maintenance system in view of implementing a maintenance strategy and protocols.
Government will contribute to the replacement of logistic means and will allocate
substantial resources to its maintenance to support mobility-based strategies.
c) Extending health services coverage
77.    Government will make sure that all health centers are operational, undertaking
rehabilitation and technical updating where needed. The construction of new health
facilities will be pursued and a new health map will be established. Districts will prepare



- 74 -                              Annex H
their own plans for improving health services coverage on the basis of objective
implantation criteria targeting the poorest areas. The private sector will be encouraged to
develop health facilities, in particular in rural areas.
d) Forging a partnership for a better health: Implications for the civil society and
the private sector
78.    Emphasis will be placed on planning and managing human resources. To address the
current scarcity, staff will be reallocated, volunteers will be recruited, a partnership
involving the private sector, Non Government Organizations (NGOs) and Associations in
the civil society will be developed, and subcontracting services will be encouraged in some
areas. Less inequity in the distribution of human resources and less mobility will be
achieved through the regionalization of budget items aimed at encouraging
contractualization.
79.    The private sector will be given a center stage role in contributing to the achievement of
objectives of improving the health of the population. To help it take up its new role, a
private sector development strategy will be designed and its implementation will follow a
master plan for the development of private health facilities across the country.
80.    A revised and updated legal framework will govern the private practice of health
professions. Capacity building in the private sector will be undertaken to improve the skills
of human resources. However the private sector will also need to contribute to their
training. The Government will support the mobilization of additional resources needed to
develop the structures.
81.    Community participation will be developed to increase the responsibilities of the
population and community based organizations (women's groups, youth organizations) in
the management of health services. Such participation will contribute to the design of
efficient and sustainable programs while encouraging the mobilization of local resources.
82.    Decentralized partnership and cooperation will be developed to reinforce management
capacity, decision making and leadership of population and local governments. The
supervision and training of health committees to improve the effective implication of the
population in the management of services will be carried out with the help of NGOs.
83.    The experience in creating community health centers will be extended to support the
community-based components of essential interventions while taking into account the
actual capacity of local population to effectively operate them.
e) Improving the quality of health care
84.    The satisfaction of health services users will be given a priority. The quality of health care
will be periodically assessed on the basis of surveys of the population and of their
representative structures such as health committees and community based organizations
(women's groups, youth organizations) as well as of service providers.
f) Combating disease
85.   In the area of monitoring and controlling communicable diseases, priority will be given to
infections representing major public health threat: HIV/AIDS/STI, malaria, Acute



- 75 -                               Annex H
Respiratory Infections (ARI), Diarrhea, measles, cholera and meningitis.
86.    Strategies to control non-communicable diseases will be designed and implemented.
87.    Efforts to control communicable and non-communicable diseases will be supported by
encouraging behaviors and environment conducive to better health.
g) Supply and availability of essential drugs, enhanced traditional drugs, medical
equipment, blood and derivative products.
88.    The issue here is to make generic essential drugs available in particular by continuing the
restructuring of the national institution responsible for drug supply and quality control.
Partnership with the private sector will be strengthened.
h) Information, Education, Communication (IEC)
89.    The implementation of this strategy will focus on reducing the main causes of morbidity
and mortality in the country, including inter alia: HIV/AIDS, malaria, Acute Respiratory
Infections (ARI), Diarrhea, meningitis, cholera, measles, high blood pressure and cancer.
i) Hospital Reform
90.    On the basis of an evaluation of existing public health facilities, the Government will
pursue the transformation of reference regional hospital centers and maternity clinics into
administrative public institutions to ensure that these structures remain functional.
Appropriate arrangements to assess the legislative and consultative structures will be
implemented.
91.    Tariffs for health services will be revised to better account for the actual cost of service
delivery and of the level of subsidies granted by the Government. In parallel appropriate
arrangements will be made to ensure a better availability of drugs. Improving the quality of
delivery constitute a permanent objective to be evaluated on the basis of actual needs of
beneficiaries. It also requires a motivated staff. Therefore special statutes governing
hospital staff will be elaborated. Particular emphasis will be given to sanitary conditions in
hospitals.
92.    To ensure proper implementation of the above strategies, each hospital will elaborate and
implement a five-year development plan. In order to ensure access by all to hospital
services, the Government will help put in place a system to meet medical costs (mutual
insurance system and/or other medical insurance scheme).
93.    To better link the hospital with its environment, the partnership with sub-regional, regional
and international hospitals, associations and private structures will be reinforced.
j) Developing reproductive health
94.    Reproductive health will be given a very high priority in the on-going health sector reform.
In its context, prevention of AIDS sexual, blood or perinatal transmission will receive a
special attention.



- 76 -                             Annex H
k) Promoting traditional medicine and pharmacopoeia
95.   In the context of improving knowledge and redirecting research in this domain, an institute
for traditional medicine and pharmacopoeia will be created.
I) Promotion of health in the workplace
96.   An appropriate legal framework will be put in place to better organize the protection of
workers' health. In addition, the existing institutional framework will be oriented towards
meeting workers' and employers' needs with respect to protection of health in the
workplace. To help maintain a quality delivery of services, the Government is committed
to implement the "Quality Insurance" approach.
m) Developing health research
97.   Health research will be listed as a priority in the 2001-2010 ten-year health development
perspective. Research outcomes will guide policies aiming at improving the health system.
A country profile including a research development plan will be prepared.
n) Promoting hygiene and sanitation
98.   This component has the following objectives:
  Adopting the hygiene and sanitation strategy;
*  Improving access to hygiene and sanitation facilities and to drinking water;
*  Strengthening food and water quality control, in particular with the establishment of a
sanitation police.
Medium term health objectives
99.   Key health policy objectives are as follows:
  Increasing health services coverage from 47.60% to 60% by 2004;
*  Increasing the full immunization coverage from 18.40% to 50% by 2004;
*  Reducing maternal mortality by 25% by 2004;
*  Reducing infant and juvenile mortality by 25% by 2004;
  Increasing the efficiency end effectiveness of the management of human, material and
financial resources made available to health services.
100.  Specific medium term measures and actions: Government is committed to implement the
following priority measures and actions:
*  Updating and implementing the 1998 staff redeployment plan;

Creating a quantitative and qualitative database enabling appropriate monitoring of the
program implementation;
*  Improving condoms availability by listing them with essential drugs;
  Adopting an action plan to meet the existing latent demand for family planning
services.
3.2 EDUCATION SECTOR
3.2.1. Background
101.  Forty years after its independence and despite the effort of the Government and its
development partners (15.47% of the General Budget in 1999), Niger has one of the lowest
enrollment rates in Africa and in the world, with a primary school enrollment of 34.14% in
1999/2000. Its literacy rate is also one of the lowest in Africa and in the world (19.9% in
2000, according to the UNICEF-MICS2-Niger multiple indicator survey).
102.  Furthermore, these low rates hide disparities between boys and girls as well as between
urban and rural areas. For instance, at the primary level, boys' enrollment reaches 41.4%
against 26.9% for girls; urban enrollment is 50.9% against 27.8% in rural areas. Enrollment
rates also differ from region to region, from 23.6% to 42.4% (excluding the Niamey urban
community). With a combined total of 19.9%, the literacy rate among men is 30.4% but
only 10.6% among women.
103.  Some of the main problems affecting Niger's education sector are:
a  High drop out and repetition rates, especially at the end of the primary and secondary
levels (an average 37% repetition rate at the end of the primary level);
*  Reproducing a largely ill-adapted education model producing graduates that do not
meet the needs of the economy and of the labor market;
*  Very high unit costs which considerably limit the development of the sector.
104.  These findings are one the reasons that have led Niger to get involved into a process of
rehabilitation and modernization of its education sector.
105.  The process was launched with the adoption of Law NR 98-12 of June 1, 1998 that defines
the broad directions of the education sector future development.
106.  The ten-year education development program under preparation has to be seen as part of
the implementation of the above law. Its content is an expression of Government's political
will and stems from a context including:
* The low development level of Niger's education sector;
*  Promulgation of the Law NR 98-12 of June 1, 1998 on orientation directives for the
education system;
a  The intemational mobilization around the theme "Education for all" through the Action
plan issued at the World Education Forum (Dakar, April 2000);
a  The results achieved by a conference of Heads of State from Burkina Faso, Guinea,
Mali, Niger, Senegal and Chad on strategies towards accelerating school enrollment
(Bamako, November 2000);



- 78 -                              Annex H
The Head of State's and Government's commitment to universal education affirmed in
the General Policy Statement and the Special program;
a Commitment of technical and financial partners to recycle the debt of highl) indebted
poor countries (HIPC initiative) in the social sectors, in particular basic education that will
receive 40% of these resources.
3.2.2. Measures related to the training and recruitment of teachers
107.  Achieving the quantitative objectives of the ten year Education Development Program, in
particular raising gross enrollment from 34.1% to 70%, will require the implementation of
major reform measures, most critically measure related to the training and recruitment of
teachers. Therefore, to improve Niger's capacity to use its already very limited public
resources towards an effective enrollment by reducing unit costs, Government's policy on
meeting the education sector needs with respect to human resources will rest on the two
following pillars:
1. Recruitment, supervision and training policy in basic education
108.  Government will only recruit Volunteer Teacher (VT) to fill all vacancies, replacement or
new positions, in primary schools in partnership with civil society.
109.  Thus 20459 teachers (81.6%) will belong to that category, out of a total of 25063 required
to meet the needs stemming from the quantitative expansion objective for 2012.
110.  Beginning with the start of the 2001-2002 school year, Government will recruit 2550
teachers of this new type to meet the requirements of Basic Education level 1. These
Education volunteers will complement the 4843 existing VT and the 476 VT from the
special program.
2. Training in Teachers colleges
111.   Such training will be reduced to one year, the mandate of these colleges being from now on
to train teachers for the education market. In that regard, 3000 teachers in average will be
trained each year, of which 2500 for the public sector. It follows that for the start of the
200 1/2002 school year, the teachers colleges total enrollment will reach 3830 students, of
which 1280 existing students and 2550 newly enrolled.
3.2.3. Role of the private sector in the delivery of education services
112.  Niger's fundamental policy option in education is the priority given to basic education.
Logically, this priority will be reflected in the budget allocation needed to achieve the
objectives. Government's available resources will be allocated in priority to basic
education.
113.  This option has implications for the other levels of education, as it will limit Government's
capacity to meet the demands of post-primary education, in particular Basic Level 2 that is
bound to expand as a result of the expansion of Basic Level 1.



-79-                                Annex H
114.  Consequently, Government will take initiatives and develop strategies to identify and
exploit any non-public opportunities that may arise in order to respond to such demand.
Private schools will have a front stage role to play in the post-primary education system.
115.  Therefore private education services which currently represents only a small fraction of the
total education supply (14% of students enrolled in the Basic Level 2) will be integrated in
the development of the secondary level of education. The Government will put in place
necessary incentives, will facilitate and support private sector development in secondary
level education.
116.  Key strategies and support options envisaged in that context are primarily focussing on
improving the regulatory framework and facilitating investments:
* Leasing or rental of facilities built for such a purpose to private sectors operators;
* Management contract of education facilities;
* Incentive measures; etc.
3.2.4. Reducing the repetition rate
117.  Reducing the repetition rate in basic education, especially at the end of the primary level,
remains a major concern. Therefore in the context of implementing the program, measure
will be designed to reduce the repetition rate at the end of the primary level from 37% to
15% by school year 2005/2006 corresponding to the first phase of the program, ant then to
7% by 20015.
118.  Key measures that will be implemented include:
i.    Improving the quality of teaching and learning through: improvement in teaching and
learning environment and conditions (Teachers training more responsive to the needs of
their profession, availability to teachers and students of teaching aid and classroom
equipment, as well as of school books in large enough quantity, with 1 book per 2
students), construction and rehabilitation of school facilities, strengthened supervision of
teachers, in particular through the CAPEDs, etc.
ii.    Revising the current students evaluation system through the delivery of a certificate to
all students completing the education level requirements; the organization of an
examination that will determine admission in the 6'h grade in proportion of the number of
slots programmed to be available in public facilities.
iii.    Adopting and implementing a new regulation relative to the repetition of CM2 (end of
the primary level). The new rule will determine a minimum average points to be achieved
by students, failing to graduate from the primary level (and thus not obtaining the
Certificaf de Fin d'Etudes du Premier Degre, or end-of-primary school certificate) and
having never repeated a class before, in order to be allowed to repeat the CM2 grade.
iv.    Broadening local communities' responsibilities in school management. The Education
Orientation Law in Niger's system sanctions the principle of communities responsibilities
in school management; Thus the implementation of the Ten Year Education Development
Plan calls for a full participation of regional and sub-regional school committees, and of



- 80 -                              Annex H
local school boards. On an experimental basis, the Government has allocated funds in the
2002 budget to be transferred to some school boards, to pay for school supplies and
operating costs. Sampling will be used to determine participating school boards and the
outcome of the experience will be assessed at the end of the 2001-2002 school year.
4. PRIVATE SECTOR PROMOTION POLICY
4.1 PRIVATE SECTOR PROMOTION
119.  Government is committed to bring up to date and to stimulate private sector activities to
help the latter become a determinant actor in economic growth and in poverty reduction. In
this context, it has adopted in March 1997 a decree approving the national policy statement
regarding the promotion of the private sector.
120.  Its prime objective is to develop the whole gamut of private sector economic activities, in
particular the production and transformation of goods and services in micro, small and
medium size enterprises, which are creating employment and generating income.
121.  To reach this objective, the Government has undertaken the following actions: (i) revision
of the labor code to increase flexibility with respect to wages, recruitment and termination
of employment, and to lift the monopoly of public services; (ii) creation of accredited
management centers to support new enterprises; (iii) harmonization and streamlining of
business laws within the OHADA framework; and (iv) launching a major program of
reforms and/or privatization of public enterprises.
122.  The Government wants to proceed with the reform process by intensifying its actix ities to
promote the private sector, in particular: (i) creating an enabling institutional and legal
environment; (ii) strengthening the organizational autonomy of the private sector; (iii)
supporting the creation and development of private enterprises; (iv) promoting and
developing local resources; (v) developing human, managerial and technological resources;
(vi) identifying and exploiting opportunities stemming from the regional integration; (vii)
restructuring the banking and financial sector; and (viii) improving the functioning of the
judiciary and modernizing its facilities.
4.2 PRIVATIZING PUBLIC ENTERPRISES
123.  The privatization program is one of the key elements of the economic and financial reforms
undertaken by the Government of Niger. Since 1996, Niger is implementing a vast
program of reforms of its public enterprises. The objective of the privatization program is
to restore the competitiveness of the nigerien industries and services in the medium termn.
124.  One objective is to refocus public sector activities on social services, such as education and
health, and to let the private sector operators manage the delivery of infrastructure services,



-81 -                              Annex H
a domain where they are better equipped to be cost effective.
125.  The privatization program is organized around the following objectives:
Medium and long term objectives
*  Boost the productivity and competitiveness of enterprises and of the economy;
*  Reduce costs and factors of production;
*  Increase local savings by facilitating the emergence of a national shareholding;
*  Increase the national budget resources;
* Meet needs in modernizing and renovating infrastructures;
*  Ensure a reliable provision of infrastructure services and population welfare.
Short term obiectives
*  Expand private sector participation in the financing of activities with new money
packages critically needed to modernize the economic production apparatus;
*  Increase the national budget resources
126.  In the context of this reform program, twelve (12) enterprises have been targeted for
privatization. Since the program has started, four (4) have already been transferred to
private operators. Three (3) enterprises have been totally privatized:
* SONITEXTIL, a textile company, privatized in July 1997;
 SOLANI, a dairy company, privatized in May 1998;
*  SNC, a cement company, privatized in August 1998.
127.  In the context of the urban water supply reform, the Government has signed in October
2000 a concession agreement with a private operator, selected through intermational
bidding, to operate National Water Supply Company and provide public water supply
services in urban areas. Similarly, In the context of liberalizing the telecommunications
sector, the Government has completed the sale of two cellular telephone licenses in
October 2000, in addition to services provided by SONITEL, the national
telecommunications parastatal.
128.  The Government is determined to proceed with the privatization of the eight (8) remaining
public enterprises, and to accelerate the process. These are:
*  SONITEL (Telecommunications);
*  NIGELEC (Power);
*  SONIDEP (Importation of petroleum products);
*  SPEHG (Owner and operator of a major hotel);
*  OFEDES (Water wells and infrastructure)
*  RlNI (Rice production)
*  Niamey refrigerated slaughterhouse
*  SLMTP (Lease of public works equipment)
129.  The status of the privatization of SONITEL, NIGELEC and SONIDEP, which are the three
main enterprises in the list above, is as follows:
SONITEL: The selected option is the divestiture of 51% of the capital. Following the lack
of responses to the first call for bids, the Government has decided to launch a new call for
bids. Bidding documents will be updated and a new bidding is planned in October 2001.



- 82 -                              Annex H
The transparent selection of a strategic buyer should take place before the end of 2001.
NIGELEC: The selected option is to grant a concession for the northern zone, the
interconnected zones and the stand-alone power plants. A notice seeking expression of
interest and draft pre-qualifying bidding documents are currently reviewed and should be
sent during the third quarter of 2001. The selection of a concession operator is planned for
the first semester of 2002.
SONIDEP: In the context of petroleum products distribution and of the privatization of
SONIDEP, the selected option is to sell a majority share of the company's capital to
petroleum products professionals. Several measures have been taken in the context of this
reform, including a price adjustment mechanism and the establishment of a taxation base.
The sale of the company's equity should take place in the course of 2002.
130.   The privatization program also includes the preparation and implementation of social plans
for the personnel as well as plans to clear the arrears of the companies to be privatized.
There is also a plan to put in place a mechanism to ensure timely payment of services
rendered to the State.
131.   A Multi-sector Regulatory Agency has been created by the ordinance NR 99-044 of
October 20, 1999. Its constitutive bodies should be put in place during the last quarter of
2001.
4.3 FINANCING THE ECONOMY
132.  In February 2001, the Government has launched the preparation of the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Document (PRSD). Reaching the objectives pursued through this participative
process will require contributions from all sectors of activity, including financial
institutions. On the one hand, a sound and well developed financial sector brings a critical
input to macroeconomic growth and stability by providing operators in the economy with
appropriate payment mechanisms, by helping mobilize savings and by making available
the financing needed by investment and consumption. Thus it contributes to the
development of trade and to an increase in savings and investments. The provision of
insurance services protecting operators against all kinds of risks, theft, fire, accidents, is
equally important. On the other hand, the financial sector development is also needed to
reduce poverty. This is especially true for local financial intermediation mechanisms such
as microfinance institutions and the post office financial services, providing services in
rural areas, to small scale enterprises and to the poorest segments of society, offering them
a safe place to save their meager resources and small financing they need for school and
health, for the acquisition of seeds, the development of micro or small enterprises or the
sale of products on the village market. Insurance companies and the social security
institution, part of the financial sector, offer a protection against illnesses and occupational
accidents, as well as a support for children and senior citizens.
133.  In addition to the Central Bank, Niger's financial system comprises seven (7) banks, one
(1) financial institution, decentralized financial Systems, Institutional savings institutions
(Social security, insurance companies) and the regional financial market with the National
Stock Exchange Agency and the Management and Internediation Company.



- 83 -                               Annex H
134.   Despite this array of financial institutions and the existence of a legal and regulatory
framework governing the sector, analytical findings show that the sector remains extremely
vulnerable and ineffective in mobilizing savings and channeling those to economic
operators and rural communities. Thus, Niger's population in general and the private sector
in particular do not receive the quantitative and qualitative financial services they need to
finance their activities and to improve their standards of leaving. This lackluster
performance of the financial sector stems from several factors and constraints.
135.  In general, and in terms of its environment, financial institutions operate in an unfavorable
economic and financial context with large financial commitments of the State to banks,
insurance companies, Social security and ONPE. The total amount of these commitments
is estimated at FCFA 63.7 billion, of which 8.5 to ONPE, 3.1 to insurance companies, 8.0
to banks and 44.1 to the social security institution. Arrears to BCEAO to be cleared by
December 31, 2001 under the Article 16 provisions amount to FCFA 30.5 billions.
Activities of the financial sector structures are further constrained by a dysfunctional
judiciary.
136.   Specifically, and in terms of its internal mechanisms, the banking system is confronted
with inadequacy between resources and application of funds; high operating costs
contrasting with a narrow range of financial products; a limited number of customers
resulting in credit being overly concentrated among services and trade sectors, while
agriculture, is largely forgotten, having received only 2% in average of the distributed
credit between 1995 and 2000, against 60% for trade and services; lack of compliance with
prudential standards by some banking institutions and difficulties associated with claims
recovery.
137.   Given the shortcomings and deficiencies that resulted in an unsustainable financial
structure, non compliance to prudential standards, unreliable information system and
internal control mechanisms, several financial institutions have been put under temporary
administration while others had their operations closely monitored by the WAEMU
banking commission.
138.   The situation of insurance companies is also a cause for concern as their capital base is
very weak, their overhead is very high, and their financial resources and their margins are
insufficient while their management lacks the required specialized skills.
139.   The postal financial system also suffers from a permanent lack of financial resources.
Traffic is steadily decreasing. The level of the postal debt is very high. It is also overstaffed
and its management system is ineffective.
140.   Microfinance development through the decentralized financial systems (DFS) is
experiencing the same limitations and weaknesses that are found in the other parts of the
financial sector. Major factors include lack of professionalism, inadequate regional
coverage, lack of perspective and synergy between the DFS and banking institutions,
concentration on short term credit, ineffective management systems and poor financial
health. Furthermore, supervision of these institutions is also problematic.
141.  The social security sector is experiencing a major liquidity squeeze. Its management lacks
the necessary autonomy and its branches are not individually managed. Private as well as
public or parapublic employers have accumulated huge arrears in social security



- 84 -                              Annex H
contributions. Overhead costs are very high and the social coverage is low (only 8% of the
population).
142.   At the national level, the "regional financial market" component of the sector suffers from
a lack of tradition in stock market transactions, a weak demand for and supply of securities
and inconsistent taxation policies with respect to securities.
143.   Given this context, it is not surprising that Niger's financial sector has been unable to fully
play its role in the process of economic development and poverty reduction. Therefore it
has become necessary to put in place in the sector the conditions for a return to stability,
long term sustainability and effective contribution to wealth generating activities.
144.  It is in this context that the Niger's Government has approached the World Bank fior its
support in launching a financial sector reform program for 2002-2003. This program
supported by the World Bank financed structural adjustment credit and by a technical
assistance credit under preparation rests on six strategic components underscored by
several measures and actions:
(a) Improving the environment in which financial institutions operate by settling the debt
overhang of the State vis-a-vis the banking sector and the insurance companies by issuing
securities, and by improving the legal framework through a study aiming at harmonizing
the national regulatory framework with the OHADA directives, changes in the national
regulatory framework, a study on debt recovery, securitizing and contracts, strengthening
the judicial inspectorate, organization of a roundtable on justice and financial institutions,
and capacity building to provide staff in the judiciary with appropriate training with respect
to operations of banks, insurance and stock exchange;
(b) Restructuring the banking sector to improve the capacity of commercial banks and of
the Money, Credit and Savings Directorate in the Ministry of finances, as well as
restructuring two state-owned commercial banks, CDN and CPTC. This will impl) closing
the accounts and getting an accurate estimate of the costs involved in such closing as well
as identifying those who will bear the burden of payments. It will also require the
preparation of a housing and local governments financing strategy with the objective of
broadening the scope of the mandate of both financial institutions and ensure that such
mandate can be discharged and is line with identified needs. To bring the restructuring of
CDN and CPCT to a successful closure, the mandate of the current temporary
administrator will need to be extended until March 31, 2002 in consultation with the
Banking Commission. Also a market survey towards the financing of small and medium
scale enterprises and of consumption in the area of real estate will be envisaged.
(c) Developing the insurance sector. Public infornation campaigns on the role of the
insurance sector will be conducted with the view to develop the insurance market. Other
activities in the program include restructuring of the insurance companies and capacity
building of their staff. As well as of the staff of the Insurance Monitoring Directorate in the
Ministry of Finance, and of the Insurance Professionals Association.
(d) Developing financial intermediation at the local level. An in-depth audit of the
microfinance institutions will be conducted to identify potential problems and the
conditions to be met for their long-term sustainability. A microfinance strategy will be
adopted. Also, the postal savings institution (ONPE) will be restructured and its Savings
and Postal Checks divisions will be rehabilitated and merged, leading to a new subsidiary



- 85 -                             Annex H
of the Post Office, with an independent legal status, institutional arrangements, accounting,
information system and management and control procedures. Other postal services,
including financial services will also be restructured (traffic, postal debt, etc.) and
information campaigns will be launched to explain to the public the reasons behind the
Post Office Administration restructuring and modernization process.
(e) Reforming the social security system will include an actuarial audit, the restructuring of
the CNSS, and the preparation and implementation of a new national social security
strategy. The reform strategy will build on an analysis of the current situation (institutional
arrangements and management, structure of contributions, delivery of services, etc.),
capitalization, extension of delivery to new beneficiaries and introduction of new products.
(f) Deepening the financial sector primarily through a study of supply of and demand for
long term financing to determine how best major investors can be supported by the
financial institutions, a more specialized study on the financing of SMEs, as well as an
information campaign on the opportunities offered by the regional financial market with
the view to encourage national economic operators, individuals and companies, to fully
take advantage of this community market, as it constitutes an appropriate framework for
the long term resources needed to finance the national economy.
145.  The above strategies and underlying measures will be implemented on the basis of a
timetable to be established for the duration of the program.
146.  The Government of Niger will define the program's performance indicators and criteria in
consultation with the World Bank.
4.4 TRANSPORT SECTOR
4.4.1. Transport sector reform
147.  To improve its competitiveness, Niger must pursue its efforts towards a more efficient
transport system, in terms of costs, timeliness, reliability and security, in particular through
the liberalization of all sector activities.
148.  The Government has shifted from the use of force accounts in road maintenance to
contracts established with private civil works enterprises and is now focussing on planning,
programming, budgeting and monitoring public works. The Equipment Directorate has
been transformed into an equipment leasing company that will be privatized soon. To
ensure an adequate financing of road maintenance, the Government has created in 1999 a
Road Maintenance Fund the resources of which come from the taxation of petroleum
products imports. The legal status of the National Road Laboratory, responsible for
handling geotechnical issues in the monitoring of public works, will be modified to make it
financially autonomous and sustainable.
4.4.2. Lifting legal and de facto monopolies in the transport sector
149.  In 1998, the Government has abandoned its control of sea freight allocations. As a



- 86 -                              Annex H
consequence, shippers are now free to select sea transport companies.
150.  In 1996, the Government has lifted the monopoly of the National Transport Company
(SNTN) on the transport of freight for mining companies. In 2000, it has abolished the
quota system used in the transport of petroleum products.
151.  Despite a flexible regulatory framework governing the transport profession and the
liberalization of transport tariffs, the "queuing" system established by the Union of
Transport Professionals for the transport of passengers and freight is contrary to
international trade regulations and has contributed to artificially raising tariffs and
maintaining a poor quality of service in transport.
152.  In concert with its social partners (Unions of Transport Professionals and Consumers
Groups), the Government has taken the institutional measures needed to discourage this
system and to create a proper framework promoting the flexibility sought by consumers
and shipping companies.
*  With respect to inter-city travel, a decree dated January 2001 organizes regular
transport services. It allows transport companies, cooperatives and GIE to provide regular
point-to-point fixed itinerary services to consumers, with fixed timetables available to the
public. Transport companies that have been created to materialize this policy are already
operational and departures are organized from privately owned bus stations. With such
services now available, queuing is now facing a stem competition.
*  With respect to domestic freight, queuing was abolished when transport tariffs were
liberalized in 1994.
*  With respect to international freight, in the Benin-Niger corridor (the main access to
the sea for Niger), Ministers of Transport of both countries have jointly adopted in
December 2000 more rigorous rules for the operation of OCBN, including inter alia
increased competition among carriers belonging to the joint organization's pool. Their
decision has already started to be implemented.
4.4.3. Reforming public enterprises in the transport sector
153.  The Government has decided to pursue the reform of SNTN. The Governments of both
Niger and Benin have decided to grant a concession contract for the operation of OCBN.
An implementation plan has been prepared in consultation with donors (French
Development Agency and World Bank) and is being implemented through a joint steering
committee (Benin-Niger). Finally, the Government has liberalized sea transport and plans
to restructure the CNUT, a national public transport users association.
4.4.4 Urban infrastructure policies
154.  In the urban sector, the Government will pursue with the support of the World Bank the
implementation of the program for construction and rehabilitation of priority urban
infrastructures. Labor intensive works will be carried out by local private entrepreneurs,
with the help of local consultants hired to help improve the management of urban
infrastructure development. The following measures will be emphasized: (i) Establishing in
major towns the foundation needed to transfer the management, execution and control of



- 87 -                            Annex H
urban infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance to the local administration; (ii)
improving the management of local administration through subcontracting and better
planning and programming; (iii) drafting the new legal status of major townships; and (iv)
enhancing the mobilization of local financial resources.
5. REFORM MONITORING AND EVALUATION
5.1 UPDATING THE KNOWLEDGE BASE ON POVERTY
155.  Updating the knowledge base on poverty is a critical priority of this Letter of Development
Policy. It is required in order to adjust continually poverty reduction policies to changes on
the ground in a context of weak data collection systems, obsolescence of available data and
emergence of new information requirements.
5.1.1. Current information systems
156.  Information is currently collected either regularly through administrative surveys
undertaken by some of the line ministries, or by periodic surveys organized at the national
level or targeting specific populations. The collection of statistical data is normally the
responsibility of the Statistics and National Accounts Directorate (SNAD) in order to
ensure the validity of the methodology used in the surveys and the quality of their outputs.
National surveys are usually conducted or supervised directly by the SNAD. The results of
the administrative surveys are periodically processed, summarized and disseminated by the
SNAD.
Standard administrative surveys
157.  The administrative structures of line ministries such as the Ministry of National Education,
of Public Health, of Rural Development, of Environment and Desertification and of Civil
Service regularly collect, process and publish information pertaining to their area of
competency. This system must be strengthened and decentralized to provide a timely
response to emerging requirements in poverty monitoring.
National surveys and light surveys
158.  Over the last decade, several surveys and studies have taken place, including: the National
Household Expenditure Survey (89/92), Poverty Profile (1994), Agriculture and livestock
Surveys (1993), Continuous Economic and Social Surveys (1994 and 1995), National
Informal Sector Survey (1995), Multiple Indicators Surveys (1996 and 2000), Niamey
Household Expenditure Survey (1996), Population and Health Surveys (1992 and 1998)
and the National Population and Housing Census (2001), the preliminary results of which
should be available in the months to come.



- 88 -                             Annex H
159.  A survey of operations conducted in Niger in recent years shows that the current
information system has produced a major collection effort. However, it is also clear that
the current collection program is sub-optimal as it provides only partial answers to concern
in poverty monitoring. This is partly due to the lack of an adequate collection program.
160.  Therefore the new system will have to offset these deficiencies to better monitor poverty
and the standards of living.
5.1.2. Required statistical information
161.  During the next three years, emphasis will be given to the production and dissemination of
information on poverty, in accordance with priority objectives defined by the Government
and on the basis of the PRSD indicators. Furthermore, data from administrative surveys
will be regularly processed and the following new surveys and studies will be undertaken
as needed:
*  Analysis and dissemination of the 3d general population census data;
*  New Standard of Living Surveys and a new Household Expenditure Survey;
*  A National Informal Sector Survey;
*  A Multiple Indicator Survey;
*  Annual Publication of the National Economic Accounts.
162.  To complement the qualitative information, a national qualitative survey on the perception
of poverty by households will be carried out. It will help understand better the determinants
of poverty and hence to better guide strategies and actions regarding poverty reduction.
163.  The lack of recent data on poverty makes it a priority to respond to these requirements. The
most compete data on poverty were collected by a Household Expenditure Survey dating
back to the early nineties.
164.  The rehabilitation of the national statistical committee during this period will allow the
harmonizing of methodologies used in national surveys as well as the implementation of a
national program of surveys in the context of monitoring poverty reduction.
5.2 MONITORING THE REFORM PROGRAM
165.  The monitoring of the program will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance
through the Economic Management Support Group (EMSG) created by the Decree NR
00374/MF/DGER of August 20, 2001. The EMSG has the responsibility for the following
activities, in cooperation with the pertinent structures and ministries:
* Drafting Niger Economic and Financial Report;
*  Managing economic and financial databases;
*  Providing statistical and econometric analytical support based on a macroeconomic
model;
*  Providing technical support to the structures responsible for the monitoring of
economic and financial programs;



- 89 -                             Annex H
* Conducting studies needed to better apprehend the performances and perspectives of
Niger's economy.
166.  The EMSG comprises four working groups:
* Macroeconomic;
* Natural resources and infrastructure;
* Human resources and governance;
* Private sector.
167.  During the 2001-2003 period, the EMSG will prepare at the end of each quarter of program
execution an Implementation Progress report that will be transmitted to the World Bank by
the Minister of Finance. The first quarterly report will be produced at the end of the fourth
quarter of 2001.
168.  Furthermore, a mid-term review and a final evaluation will be carried out before June 2002
and December 2003 respectively and their findings will be integrated in specific reports.
169.  The EMSG will require technical assistance and material support from the World Bank for
the establishment of an economic and financial database, accessible to all users (decision
makers, civil society, development partners).
5.3 TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE REQUIREMENTS
170.  The human and material capacities of Niger's administration in all sectors have
considerably deteriorated in recent years.
171.  In the area of public finances where the Government intends to accelerate the process of
reform, as stated in its Letter of Development Policy, the absence of adequate capacity is
eloquently illustrated by the poor quality of public finances statistics, the long interruption
in producing a Budget Review Law as well as the lack of activities by the Supreme Audit
Office by lack of qualified staff.
172.  In this context, the implementation of the reforms will require that external support will
need to be programmed in order to meet the requirements of the reform implementation
timetable.
173.  The following are the areas where the need of support will be the most determinant for the
implementation of the reform program:
* Macroeconomic and public finances management;
* Financial sector;
* Social sectors.
5.3.1. Macroeconomic and public finances management
Macroeconomic modeling
174.  The World Bank is already providing support to the Government in the area of



- 90 -                             Annex H
macroeconomic modeling. It supervises the work of an inter-ministerial group responsible
for the development of a model of Niger's economy, and for the monitoring of economic
program and economic analysis.
175.  In order to achieve the expected results, including the creation of economic analysis
capacity, it is indispensable to maintain the current technical assistance and to consolidate
its impact through the organization of in-service training for members of the inter-
ministerial group.
176.  The Government will make necessary contacts to ensure that all partners willing to help
Niger in this area will align their assistance with this plan.
Public finances
177.  With respect to budget preparation, the Government has opted for the establishment of a
Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) in order to provide a multi-year
perspective in the national budget, which is more consistent with poverty reduction
objectives.
178.  At the sector level, programming will be developed in preparation of program budgets that
will improve the quality of public expenditures by linking expenses to measurable
development objectives.
179.  During 2001, the Government has defined with the technical support of the World Bank
the key steps needed to put a MTEF in place and has laid the foundation for the preparation
of program budgets in health and education.
180.  The Government will make necessary arrangements to develop the instrument needed to
program expenditures on the medium term and will train the staff that will use these
instruments with the support of its development partners.
181.  With respect to the revision of the budget nomenclature, the Government has established a
working group with the technical assistance of the World Bank. The team has already
achieved considerable progress.
182.  With respect to budget execution, the Government is committed to the computerization of
the budget system to achieve its objective of simplifying the public expenditures system,
improving cash management at the Treasury and the production and dissemination of
appropriate information among all parties involved in the budget execution.
183.  Significant progress in the computerization has been achieved at the central level with the
financial support of the World Bank. The next steps that are planned involve the
connection of decentralized services to the existing network, improvement of the existing
system and its effective use in the central administration. Several partners have manifested
their interest in helping Niger in extending its budget systems to the regions.
184.  With respect to public procurement, the Government has prepared several draft regulations
and laws including a new procurement code. The Government will recruit a high level
expert to carry out an in-depth review of said texts before their final adoption.
185.  In the area of accounting and monitoring and evaluation of budget operations, the need for



- 91 -                              Annex H
assistance is particularly acute in the following areas: (i) revision of the management
accounting nomenclature, (ii) Public Expenditure Review covering all aspects and
procedures of the national budget, and (iii) evaluation of the economic and physical impact
of the public expenditures.
186.  With respect to the closing of budget accounts, the Government has prepared draft budget
review laws and management accounts for the 1997, 1998 and 1999 fiscal years and has
transmitted them to the National Assembly and to the Supreme Audit Office for
Parliamentary and Jurisdictional verification.
187.  However, due to the lack of qualified personnel, these institutions were not yet able to
carry out the process needed for a final adoption of these laws.
188.  In that regard, the Government intends to strengthen these institutions with qualified staff
allocated to help them carry out budget control activities and with an appropriate training
program for which it is seeking the support of its partners.
5.3.2. Financial sector
189.   Since 1999, the Government is committed to the preparation of a specific adjustment
program including an important technical assistance component. Several bilateral partners
(AFD, GTZ) and multilateral (IFAD, EU) already bring technical support to Niger in the
area of microfinance. This assistance will be enhanced through the Rural Financial
Services Program to be launched in September-October 2001.
190.  In the context of the Financial Sector Reform program supported by the World Bank that
will cover the 2002-2003 period, Structure of the Ministry of Finance responsible for the
monitoring and control of financial institutions will receive a technical assistance. This
assistance will also be extended to banks, insurance companies and microfinance
institutions through the training of their human resources.
5.3.3. Social sectors
191.   The Government has carried out several important activities to improve the effectiveness of
public services in the social sectors (education and health) and to better control their costs.
These include in particular the Public expenditure Review in the education and health
sector, the preparation of the ten-year education plan and preparatory work towards the
implementation of program budgets.
192.  In the coming years, emphasis will be put on sector planning and program budgets.
Therefore the Government requests the support of its partners to make working tools
available and to train the professional staff concerned.
