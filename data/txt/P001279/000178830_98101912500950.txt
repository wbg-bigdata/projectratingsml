I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Economic Setting
1.01      The Republic of Kenya (Map 1) covers an area of some 583,000 km ,
about the same size as France. Although the country lies on the equator,
variations in altitude provide a wide range of climatic conditions. GDP grew
at 6.15Z p.a. in real terms between 1964 and 1973, but has slowed down in
recent years to 4.5% p.a. from 1973 to 1978, and to an estimated 3% in 1979,
following accelerated worldwide inflation and the decline in the value of
agricultural output. GNP per capita was US$380 in 1979. The economy is
largely based on agriculture, which accounted for about 60% of export earnings,
and an average of about one third of GDP at constant prices during 1975-77,
with subsistence farming contributing nearly 50% of agricultural value added.
Since the late sixties, tourism has been of growing importance and is now the
second largest earner of foreign exchange after coffee exports. Industrial
production has also grown quite rapidly during the 1970s, increasing by 6.5%
p.a. from 1972 to 1977.
1.02      Kenya's economic growth has placed tremendous demands on the trans-
port sector. The increased demand for transport has been for both the import
and export of goods, and the internal movement of goods, particularly of
agricultural produce and the distribution of services.
B. The Transport System
1.03      The heaviest concentration of transport facilities, comprising
road, rail and air services, is along the 1,000 km corridor from Mombasa
on the coast, to the Ugandan border, via Nairobi. This is a densely populated
area of major economic importance, containing over half of Kenya's population.
The corridor is also a major transport route for goods to and from Uganda,
Rwanda, Burundi, southern Sudan and parts of eastern Zaire. Other areas of
Kenya, particularly the east and north, are poorly served by transport
facilities, although these areas tend to be less developed economically and/or
less densely populated. Practically all of the 2,000 km rail network is in
the Mombasa-Ugandan border corridor as well as a sizeable proportion of the
50,000 km road network; the only port of significance is Mombasa, on the
Indian Ocean, an oil pipeline runs 452 km from Mombasa to Nairobi, and the
focus of aviation is on the Nairobi and, to a lesser extent, Mombasa inter-
national airports.
Railways
1.04      Details of the more than 2,000 km rail network are included in
Chapter II.



-2-
Roads
1.05      The total classified road network comprises 50,600 km of roads, of
which 4,330 are bitumen, an estimated 16,000 km are gravel and the remaining
30,000 km are earth. Traffic on the trunk, primary and secondary classified
network has increased by an average of 6.6% p.a. between 1973 and 1978. The
traffic fleet has increased by 8.2% p.a. since 1970 to a total of 238,000
vehicles in 1977, when vehicle density was 16.5 per thousand population, which
is quite high for Eastern Africa. To meet the demands of an expanding economy,
road transport has increased rapidly.  The number of trucks, trailers and
buses on the road grew by 8.3% p.a. during 1970-77, whereas the passenger car
fleet grew at an average of 7.2% p.a. over the same period; average truck size
has also increased.
Ports
1.06      Mombasa, Kenya's principal port, handles most of the country's
imports and exports as well as transit traffic. The port's capacity is
estimated at about 3 million tons per year including oil. Traffic reached a
peak in 1973, when general cargo traffic amounted to 2.5 million tons, but
declined in 1975 and 1976 to about 1.8 million tons, mainly because of lower
Ugandan imports and exports. During 1977, however, general cargo traffic
increased to 2.0 million tons. Port management is generally competent, and
the port has been earning a net surplus after depreciation and interest.
The Kenya Port Authority was established in 1977 to replace the East African
Harbours Corporation (EAHC), but management and staff have remained relatively
unchanged.
Civil Aviation
1.07      Nairobi is one of the principal aviation centers of Africa.  Inter-
national air transport services are provided to Nairobi by 28 airlines on a
scheduled basis, and 17 on a non-scheduled basis. Passenger traffic at
Nairobi International Airport increased by 17% from 1972 to 1976, but there-
after declined with the decrease in tourism: in 1979 there were 1.3 million
passengers. Air transport is of major importance to the tourist industry
since the majority of tourists travel to Kenya by air, and many travel within
Kenya by chartered air services. Air transport is also important for Kenya's
rapidly expanding export of perishable horticultural and farm products which
go principally to Europe. These exports increased from 1,476 tons in 1968 to
25,077 tons in 1977. Both Nairobi and Mombasa have international airports,
while scheduled domestic services are provided to four other airports and
several game parks.  Until January 1977, one of the principal international
carriers serving Kenya was East African Airways Corporation, the multi-
nationally owned airline of the East African Community. With the de facto
breakup of the Community and East African Airways, a national airline, Kenya
Airways, was established to take its place in providing domestic, regional and
international services. Kenya Airways currently flies to five other African
countries, Europe, Mauritius, the Seychelles, India and Saudi Arabia. Its
fleet consists of three 707s, one 720B, one DC-9 and two F-27s. The financial
situation of Kenya Airways is as yet indeterminate.



-3-
Oil Pipeline
1.08      The Government-owned Kenya Pipeline Company operates a 452 km pipe-
line, financed with Bank assistance, to transport white oil products from
Mombasa to Nairobi.  Construction   was completed in late-1947, and the pipe-
line was in full operation by mid-1978. About 1.3 million m were transported
in 1978, with annual growth thereafter projected3at about 4% p.a. Initial
capacity of the pipeline is a~out 3.75 million m p.a., but this can be
increased to 5 to 6 million m p.a. by increasing the number of pumping
stations from four to eight.
C. Transport Planning and Intermodal Coordination
Transport Planning
1.09      Until December 1979 transport planning was divided between two
ministries, the Ministry of Works covering highways and the Ministry of Power
and Communications covering all other transport modes as well as regulation
of the road network and the road transport industry. Coordination of planning
came under the Ministry of Economic Planning and Community Affairs. However,
in December 1979 the two Ministries of Works and of Power and Communications
were merged, so that all transport planning and operations now fall under the
Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC). MTC has inherited a good
Planning Unit from the previous Ministry of Works; the Unit which carries out
all of its own feasibility studies for road projects, is now in the process of
being reorganized and will be expanded so as to improve transport planning and
the formulation of transport policy.
1.10      During the last planning  period (1974-1978) KE 213 million was
allocated to the transport sector, of which KE 60 million was for railways,
Kb 99 million for roads, and Kb 54 million for ports and civil aviation. Road
development expenditures have mainly been increased during the current planning
period because of major rehabilitation and reconstruction works required on
the Mombasa-Nairobi-Uganda border route, and extensive rural road construction
and improvement programs. While the overall allocation to highways and
railways appears to have been reasonable for each of the sub-sectors, some
projects were neglected at the expense of other projects of lower economic
importance.  However, the present transport plan has attempted to rectify this
this by including investment for higher priority projects.
1.11      The Fourth National Development Plan for FY79-83 includes nearly
Kh 300 million for the transport sector, or 20% of total public investment.
Kh 35 million have been allocated to railways, compared to Kb 203 million for
roads, and KE 56 million for ports, shipping and civil aviation. Railway
development expenditures were higher during the previous planning period
because of the establishment of KR in 1977 and the need to catch up with
capital investment postponed since early 1970 by the East African Railways
Corporation (EARC). The main objective for the transport sector as outlined
in the National Development Plan is to improve competition between road



- 4 -
transport and railways so as to achieve a more efficient allocation of re-
sources, making the railways the principal means of transport over long
distances. The overall size of the Transport Sector Plan is ambitious, and
will probably be reduced given financial and implementation constraints.
However, the relative allocation of funds between sub-sectors appears adequate.
Although there are no expenditures allocated for railway extensions in the
Plan, there are provisions for feasibility studies of various branch lines.
The Government is about to contract consultants to carry out a feasibility of
the Kerio Valley Railway, a 230 km branch line from Solai to Marich Pass.
Given that this and other proposed branch lines are, in all probability, not
economically justified at this time, it is recommended that Kenya Railways
(KR) does not take on the financial burden of any such investments in branch
lines (paras 5.14 and 6.01).
Transport Policy
1.12      During the 1960s most long-distance freight was transported by rail,
mainly because commercial road transport was subject to considerable operational
restrictions, primarilj through licensing, which protected the differential
tariffs of the railway. In the late sixties, road transport regulations were
relaxed and this, together with improved roads, particularly the paving of the
Mombasa-Nairobi road led to a substantial rise in road transport throughout
the seventies. Furthermore, from 1974 to 1978 the Railways faced severe
operational and capacity problems during the gradual breakup of the EARC and
the eventual formation of KR, which naturally increased the competitiveness of
road transport, but the purchase of additional rolling stock in 1979 has now
given the railways additional capacity. Given the Railways problems over the
last five years it is difficult to assess how much traffic is going by road
because of consumer preference, rather than force of circumstance (i.e.,
because the Railways were unable to carry more goods). Information obtained
from railway customers shows that private manufacturing companies and dealers
transport considerable amounts of their inputs and finished goods by road;
this would include such products as cement, limestone, iron and steel, and
timber. However, information gathered on the modal split in respect of main
commodities carried by rail and road is incomplete and, in some cases, un-
reliable. The road user charge study will obtain more reliable information on
goods transported by road (para 1.14). Speed and reliability of services were
stated as the main reasons, despite a substantially higher tariff for road
transport (about 50-100%). In addition, practically all of Rwanda, Burundi
and eastern Zaire traffic, plus a substantial amount of Uganda traffic (pos-
sibly more than twice as much as goes by rail), goes by road because of the
lack of transshipment facilities in Uganda and the unreliable and limited
service provided by Uganda Railways (UR).
1.13      Because of KR's restricted capacity from 1974-78 Government took
few active measures to divert traffic back from the roads to the railways
during the seventies. Government has taken measures to improve the railways
by making substantial investment in rolling stock to build up the capacity
of the railways. Apart from encouraging the agricultural and other commodity
marketing boards to transport goods by rail, a relatively laissez-faire
attitude has prevailed with respect to road transport. Consequently, Kenya



-5-
has a good road transport system, which appears to be quite competitive.
However, the Government is concerned that considerable long distance traffic
is going by road, and is reviewing measures to help divert traffic back to the
railways. The proposed project is one positive measure to realize this
objective, as with the project there will be more than adequate railway
capacity, and reliability and speed of railway service should be improved.
Also the railway costing system will be updated and marketing techniques
improved. Another measure under consideration is to encourage the transporta-
tion of all external freight traffic through Kenya by rail. The proposed
proje-tF includes the provision of transshipment facilities at the Kenya-
Uganda border, which will be needed in the short-term at least (para. 2.16),
given the inadequate facilities in Uganda and the limitations of UR. In
addition, more traffic could be carried by UR if cooperation between KR and UR
were to improve.  The Bank has advised the Government that efforts be concen-
trated on effecting a railway agreement between KR and UR, improving the
efficiency of KR, ensuring that road user taxation is adequate, and studying
the movement of specific major commodities to identify problems in the distri-
bution system, and A, o formulate measures for improving the system. The latter
studies have been included in the project (para 3.19).
1.14      MTC has recently hired consultants to carry out a road user charge
study (whose terms of reference have been approved by the Bank). The study,
which will be completed in 1981, will take into consideration transport
demand, the capacity of the present transport system and real costs of trans-
port, including handling, time, inventory, storage and other costs. The
consultants will then recommend road user charges to achieve a distribution of
traffic as close to the optimum as possible, taking into account social
welfare policies, regional development plans and other factors which might
require divergence from the economic optimum. On completion of the study it
may be necessary to undertake further detailed studies of particular aspects
of the sector, such as specific commodity studies; these studies would be
carried out by the Planning Unit but would be set up with the assistance of
consultants provided under the proposed project who would also review the
final results. During negotiations, assurances have been obtained that the
Government and KRC will implement the recommendations of these studies not
later than January 1, 1982.
D. Past Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
1.15      The Bank Group has been involved in Kenya's transport sector since
the country's independence in 1963.  Loans and credits have been made amount-
ing to US$339 million for roads, Nairobi Airport, the oil pipeline, railways
and ports; however, only part of the railways and ports loans directly bene-
fitted Kenya since they were made to the East African Railways and Harbours
Corporations (EARHI) (Annex I).
1.16      The Bank has made three loans (one including a small component
for ports), totalling US$104.4 million for the development of the railway
under the various East African Corporations. Two of the loans are fully
disbursed, but the third will not be fully disbursed until the mediation
process is complete. Two other loans, totalling US$61.5 million, plus a



-6-
sm,all component of the joint railways and ports loan mentioned above, went
toward the development of Mombasa's port; these loans also will not be fully
disbursed until the mediation process is complete. Recently the Bank has been
involved in the upgrading and expansion of Nairobi's International Airport
under a US$29.0 million loan which has been fully disbursed; the new terminals
were opened in March 1978. The Bank also provided a US$20 million loan
towards the construction of the oil pipeline from Mombasa to Nairobi.
Construction was completed in October 1977, and the loan should be fully
disbursed in 1981. Since 1960, the Bank Group has lent US$214.2 million for
11 road projects and major road components included in agricultural projects.
Funds have been provided for the construction and strengthening of about
1,200 km of trunk roads and construction of 8,625 km of feeder, special
purpose, agricultural, and rural access roads, and for road maintenance.
Four of the projects are still ongoing; one loan should be fully disbursed in
1980, two in 1982 and the last in 1985. Institution building coaponents of
road projects have assisted with the development of the Roads Department to
the extent that the First Highway Sector Loan was rmade to Kenya in 1979.
II. KENYA RAILWAYS
A. Introduction
2.01      KR was created in early 1977 out of the defunct EARC.  It was
formalized by the enactment of the Kenya Railways Corporation Act in January
1978, to become a national entity operated by Kenyans in the interest of the
national economy. The Corporation provides a network of rail, road and inland
waterways transport services in Kenya.
2.02      The railway system from Mombasa to Nairobi was built between 1896
and 1899, and from Nairobi to Kisumu between 1899 and 1901. The railway
has seven branch lines, built between 1915 and 1930, of which one connects
with the Tanga line of the Tanzania Railway system, at Moshi. This line is
presently closed at the Tanzania border.
2.03      In 1948, the Kenya and Uganda Railways and Hlarbours Services and
the Tanganyika Railways and Port Services were amalgamated as EARH, overseen
by the East African High Commission.  In 1961 this Commission was replaced by
the East African Common Services Organization, which in turn was succeeded in
1967 by the East African Community created under the Treaty of East African
Cooperation. As a result of Article 71 of the Treaty, EARHI was divided into a
Railways (EARC) and a Harbours (EAHC) Corporation. fIowever, owing to diffi-
culties between the Partner States since 1973, resulting in the break-up of
the Community, three separate railway corporations were created in 1977, one
each for Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.

B. Organization, Management and Staff
2.04      Kenya Railways is a parastatal company headed by a Managing Director
reporting to the Minister of Transport and Communications through a Board of
Directors comprising a Chairman, the Managing Director, the Permanent Secretary
of the Ministry responsible for the railways, the Permanent Secretary to the
Treasury, the Managing Director of the Kenya Ports Authority, and not more
than three persons unaffiliated with the Railways, who are appointed by the
Minister.
2.05      Reporting to the Managing Director are seven department heads: Chief
Administrative Secretary, Chief Accountant, Chief Mechanical Engineer, Chief
Civil Engineer, Chief Traffic Manager, Chief Personnel Manager and Chief
Supplies Officer (Chart 20939). Although a Deputy Managing Director was
originally expected to assist the Managing Director in coordination and
planning of various activities, the position was nevei filled and the Managing
Director has had to carry out this work himself. The overly centralized
organizational structure has forced the Managing Director to carry an unneces-
sarily heavy workload. Since the present structure wa- set up as a stop-gap
measure at the breakup of the EARC, it should now be reviewed by a consultant
and, if necessary, reorganized. This was agreed during negotiations.
2.06      For operating and maintenance purposes, KR is divided into three
engineering districts (Mombasa, Nairobi, and Nakuru), each having a district
mechanical engineer and civil engineer (reporting to headquarters in Nairobi,
and five traffic districts (Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru, Kicumu and Marine
Services) each under the jurisdiction of a District Traffic Superintendent
reporting to the Assistant Chief Commercial Traffic Manager and Assistant
Chief Traffic Manager Operations in Nairobi.
2.07      The past years of uncertainties during the EAC breakup and the
establishment of KR have led to a weakening of the Railways  management.
During the past three years alone, ten senior managers have left KR. Weak-
nesses are particularly apparent in planning and coordination, statistics
and reporting, and in commercial activities. Although this situation is
serious, KR's management seems to be stronger than any other railway manage-
ment in the region, and it is likely that the problems can be solved by
msodifying the organizational structure, strengthening certain sections
with technical assistance, and expanding the training program.
2.08      The total staff numbers 21,000, of whom some 30 are expatriates
employed in the two engineering departments. One expatriate is holding the
Deputy Chief Civil Engineer's position and two others are section heads;
all other expatriates are at lower levels. Until KR has completed training of
its own staff, which is expected in three to five years, expatriate staff
should be used to fill vacancies in key posts. One major problem, however,
remains outstanding. It is difficult for KR to retain its staff after
completion of training because Government's salary policy with respect to KR
is not competitive witil salaries in p.lvate irdustry. With the current growth
of private industry, and the construction industry is particular, the
competition for civil engineers will become even greater.

C. Training
2.09      Opened in June 1956, KR's Training School was originally built to
train EARC staff but is presently used only for KR's needs and on occasion to
train railway staff from the Eastern African countries. The school has 60
instructors for its seven sections: mechanical engineering, civil engineering,
traffic, supervising, accounts, supplies, and clerical. The school has
capacity to train 1,000 students at any one time, and currently graduates
abo_t 700-800 students each year, 250 from the mechanical section, 120 each
from the clerical and supervisory sections, and the remaining evenly spread
over other sections. Students are trained up to the foreman level, but plans
now exist to build a wing for a management training program which will be
staffed by both local and expatriate training experts.
2.10      The quality of training is particularly good; however, some physical
improvements are now needed, including the renewal of some buildings, a review
of the physical catacity of the various training sections, and the replacement
of old equipment. Furthermore, before a management wing is built and new
houses constructed, plans for the whole training school should be reviewed and
training needs investigated. This was agreed during negotiations.
2.11      Training opportunities abroad are also offered to engineering
graduates after two years of on-the-job training in KR. This normally consists
of nine months of specialized training in India, Japan or the United Kingdom;
as yet, however, no supervisory or management training has been offered to
these students, which is a serious shortcoming (para. 3.17).
D. Track
2.12      KR operates 2,050 km of meter gauge single track:  1,080 km of main
line from Mombasa to Malaba at the Uganda border, and 970 km of branch lines.
2.13      All rail is laid on steel sleepers, except for a small part of the
Magadi line with wood and concrete sleepers. The track from Mombasa to
Nairobi has 95 lb/yard rail; the remainder of the main line has 75 lb/yard and
80 lb/yard rail; and all branch lines have rail of 50 lb/yard and 60 lb/yard
(Chart 20940).  The age of the rail varies.  New rail is found on curves and a
short length of track between Gilgil and Nakuru. The rail on most of the main
line and on some branch lines is between 16-50 years old, while that on
the main line between Eldoret and Malaba and on the remaining branch lines is
more than 50 years old (Chart 20941). The rail on all curved sections has to
be renewed continuously due to heavy wear, and the very old rail on the
Eldoret-Malaba section and the branch lines to Kisumu and Kitale is now beyond
its economic life and should be replaced for reasons of safety.
2.14      Track maintenance is supervised by three District Civil Engineers
zox'ering the district_, wit!S >e_dnlarterE at Mombasa, Nairobi and Nakuru.
Maintenance groups living in staff quarters along the line are responsible for

a six to seven km section, which is adequate to keep the track well maintained.
KR has plans to eventually reorganize the present maintenance system by
introducing mechanical track maintenance since it is becoming more difficult
to have staff living along the line at considerable distances from schools,
hospitals and other social services. In the meantime, however, it will
improve housing for track maintenance staff, where needed, since their
quarters have deteriorated considerably during the last ten years.
2.15      Track maintenance equipment is 10 to 15 years old and is generally
beyond its economic life. Machinery and equipment in track maintenance depots
is also wearing out and needs replacing. New depots for long welding of rail
and the manufacture of sleepers are required (see para. 3.04).
2.16      KR is currently planning to establish a transshipment depot at Malaba
to facilitate the movement of transit traffic between Mombasa and neighboring
countries (Uganda, southern Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi and eastern Zaire). Because
the capacity of Uganda Railways (UR) has been seriously constrained, most
transit traffic is now routed entirely by road and represents an unnecessary
added burden on Kenya's limited highway network. Since plans to improve UR
are still unclear, KR has decided to construct the Malaba transshipment depot
with facilities for containerized freight to allow rail transport from Mombasa
to Malaba and, if necessary, road transport thereafter.
2.17      Mombasa station needs to be replaced.  Built in 1896, the station
consists of sheds ill-suited to present traffic requirements, and staff are
forced to work in temporary barracks scattered around the station area or
in houses elsewhere in the city. Partly as a result of this arrangement,
the efficiency of railway operations has suffered and trained staff have
left KR.
E. Telecommunications
2.18      The main line and the branch lines to Magadi and Kisumu are equipped
with a key-token signalling system, while the other branch lines use the train
order system. The main signalling equipment was installed in 1957-1959 and is
still functioning well, although spare parts are becoming difficult to obtain.
A feasibility study for improvement of the signalling system has already
begun with financing from the Federal Republic of Germany, and KR is planning
to renew the system when justified for capacity reasons, which is not expected
before 1983.
2.19      The telecommunications system is basically an open wire transmission
system with interlinks between switchboards at Nairobi and Mombasa via radio
transmission. The complete system is about 60 years old although some replace-
ments have been made in later years; the Nairobi and Mombasa switchboards
are 25 years old; and a battery-operated telephone system is 20 years old.
At present, telecommunications on the Nairobi-Mombasa line break down on an
average of 28 times a month, with repairs taking from 8 to 17 hours each time.
A German consulting group has already studied the system and has recommended
its renewal.

F. Locomotives and Rolling Stock
2.20      KR currently has an over-capacity of both locomotives and wagons,
and the existing locomotive fleet should be sufficient to handle the traffic
projected up to 1984-85, provided spare parts are available. The fleet,
which was converted to diesel power between 1958 and 1979, although some
steam locomotives will still be in operation during the project period,
consists of 89 main line diesel electric locomotives and 148 branch line
loco-^"ives and shunters, most of which are diesel hydraulic. Of the main
line locomotives, 36 are close to 20 years old but could stay in service at
least for another 5 years if spare parts are available. Of the branch line
and shunting locomotives, 32 are at least 25 years old and will be scrapped
during the project period; replacements have recently been procured. The
availability rate of locomotives has been low, averaging 55%-60% in 1975-1978
for main line locomotives and 65%-70% for others; this has been due to lack
of preventive maintenance from May 1974 to July 1975, when major problems
within the EAC began to develop, and later on due to lack of spare parts.
2.21      When the rail links with Tanzania were discontinued in 1975, 67% of
EAR's total wagon fleet were left on the Kenya/Uganda section. KR currently
has some 6,700 wagons, of which about 5,000 are bogie wagons (double units)
and 1,700 are two-axle wagons (single units), in total some 11,700 units of
wagons. Another 1,700 units belonging to Uganda Railways also operate in
Kenya. Of KR's fleet, 50% are covered wagons, 28% open wagons and 11% tank
wagons of different kinds. The remaining 11% consist of various wagons for
specialized traffic. The wagon fleet is quite new and in good condition.
Only one third of the wagons are more than 25 years old, and 1,200 were
acquired as recently as 1979. This should meet the need for wagons beyond the
project period, except for some specialized wagons for transport of soda ash,
logs and containers. However, spare parts continue to be in short supply due
to lack of foreign exchange, and the availability rate, now 80%, has conse-
quently suffered.
2.22      For its passenger traffic, KR has 170 passenger coaches and another
16 coaches are being delivered. Of the fleet, 26 are first class, 41 second
class and the remaining 103 third class. KR also has 17 restaurant and buffet
cars, 116 departmental and inspection cars, and 222 brake and luggage vans.
Except for 12 recently-delivered third class coaches, all wagons are more than
20 years old and most of them more than 30 years old. The coaches are all
well maintained, but replacements are necessary to offer safe passenger
service in the future. The present fleet is also insufficient for the increas-
ing demand.  Accordingly KR will be ordering ten coaches to be financed by
the AfDB which will be delivered after the project period (see para. 2.33).
G. Workshop and Depots
2.23      The workshop for overhaul and major repair of locomotives, wagons
and coaches is located at Nairobi. Depots for servicing locomotives are
located at Mombasa (Changamwe), Nairobi (Makadara), Nakuru and Eldoret, while
major depots for repair of wagons are at Mombasa and Nairobi.



- 14 -
2.24      The Nairobi workshop was built to meet the needs of the entire EARC
system and is too large for KR's present needs. Part of its excess capacity
is however being used for external works. The locomotive shop is currently
being modified to allow the repair of diesel, rather than steam, locomotives;
other shops are generally in good condition, although there is a need to
rehabilitate some buildings, to replace some machinery, and to provide
specialized equipment for repair of specific diesel locomotive components.
The whole workshop organization and all workshop facilities should however be
reviewed in line with KR's future requirements before any major modifications
should be done.
2.25      The change from steam to diesel traction has also required the
modification of all locomotive depots, which is now underway and will continue
throughout the project period.  The recently opened depot at Changamwe is
operating well, but has been assigned some 60 locomotives rather than 40 as
planned since no other depot has the capacity to service more units. Other
depots are in acceptable condition and need only minor improvements.
2.26      The wagon depot at Changamwe is also new and is operating well.
However, lack of trained manpower has reduced its capacity to one third
of its planned 60 wagons per day, and this has resulted in a backlog of wagons
to be repaired in the Mombasa area. A major reason for this manpower shortage
is the lack of housing facilities at Changamwe and the lack of public
transport between Mombasa and Changamwe.
H. Water Transport
2.27      Since the breakup of the EAC, marine services are only a minor
part of KR's operation. The only existing traffic is transport of agricul-
tural products in the Homa Bay area by tugboats and lighters to Kisumu
for further transport on the railway network. Kisumu has a railway wagon
ferry terminal in good condition, and one of the wagon ferries belonging
to the EAC is berthed at the terminal awaiting decision as to future owner-
ship. KR would like to improve transport to Homa Bay by building a wagon
ferry terminal there to avoid transshipment at Kisumu. They also have an
ongoing program to improve docks and piers in the area.
2.28      The marine services also have a workshop and docks for repair and
construction of ships at Kisumu. These facilities have been little used in
later years due to the low traffic levels; however, since traffic is expected
to increase in the future, the Kisumu workshop buildings, which are now old
and in poor condition, will need to be improved for upcoming operations.
I. Operations
2.29      KR is capable of handling 22 trains a day between Nairobi and
Mombasa and on occasion has operated 26 trains a day. At present, however,
only 12 trains are running due to the low traffic level. The maximum number
of wagon units allowed per train is: 79 on the Mombasa-Nairobi section, 75 on
the Nairobi-Malaba and Konza-Magadi sections and 55 units on all other lines.



- 15 -
The average speed is about 30 km/h for freight trains and about 40 km/h for
passenger trains. Operations are smooth, and trains show a good record for
punctuality although the unrealiable telecommunications system sometimes
causes serious delays. In the past locomotive availability has been poor, and
some trains have had to be cancelled for lack of locomotives. This problem
has been temporarily solved by delivery of new diesel locomotives and a
limited supply of spare parts.
J. Traffic
(i) Freight Traffic
2.30      From 1971 to 1979 freight traffic carried by KR fluctuated consider-
ably, with an overall decline from 1973 to 1979, largely because of the steady
decrease in Ugandan traffic during the last decade and the limited capacity of
the railways from 1974 to 1978. In 1979, about 3.8 million tons were carried,
3.6 million tons of which was internal traffic and the remainder Ugandan
traffic. This compares to 4.2 million tons in 1971, of which 1.3 mllion tons
was Ugandan traffic. This has inevitably affected the length of KR's average
haul, which has decreased from 710 km in 1971 to 530 km in 1979.
2.31      Kenya's internal freight traffic increased by an average of 4.5%
p.a. between 1971-79 (page 17), although it fluctuated considerably throughout
that period. Traffic actually declined in 1975 as a result of operational
problems on the railway and the country-s general economic stagnation; however,
with the establishment of KR in 1977, traffic increased by 2.3% p.a. until
1979, despite the opening of the oil pipeline in 1978, which resulted in the
loss of over 10% of the 1977 traffic. In 1979, ten commodities accounted for
75% of KR's internal freight traffic; these were oil products, cement, lime
and limestone, iron and steel, soda ash, fluorspar, grains, coffee, sugar and
fertilizers.
2.32      The decline of Ugandan traffic, which represented only 4% of KR's
total tonnage in 1979 compared to 34% in 1971, has been due not only to
Uganda's deteriorating economic situation, particularly since 1975, but also
to the declining performance of Uganda Railways (UR), operational problems
between KR and UR, and inadequate transshipment facilities (para. 3.05).
Consequently, a substantial amount of transit traffic must now go by road,
including almost all of the traffic for Burundi, Rwanda and eastern Zaire,
which is estimated at over 200,000 tonnes; the amount of Uganda traffic going
k          by road is not known, but is thought to be at least 400,000 tonnes per year.
(ii) Passenger Traffic
2.33      Passenger traffic has fluctuated considerably since 1974 partly as a
result of a disruption of rail services, caused by the breakup of the EARC
when passenger services were periodically withdrawn because of a shortage of
locomotives. KR increased passenger service capacity and reliability in 1979,
and as a result, traffic increased by more than 25%. In addition, many
potential customers were turned away because of an insufficient number of
passengers cars. In part, the excess demand for rail passenger services is
due to the low fares which appear to be below operating costs, excluding



- 16 -
depreciation, and are far below bus fares over the same distance. Passenger-km
in 1979 amounted to 499 million, an 83% increase over the 1971 level; however,
the number of passenger journeys has not increased between 1971 and 1978.
This means that the average journey length has increased considerably from 154
km in 1971 to 283 km in 1979, mostly because of increased travel between the
west of Kenya and Nairobi. Owing to the past disruption of service and the
obvious, though unquantified, excess demand in 1979, future passenger traffic
is difficult to estimate; it will depend largely on changes in the tariff
level and the relative competitiveness of the revised tariffs with those of
road transport. The Government has agreed to a 16% increase in the tariff
as an interim measure to be reviewed when the traffic costing unit is opera-
tional (para. 5.19).
K. Budget, Accounts, Audit and Insurance
2.34      The fiscal year end of KR is December 31.  A detailed annual budget
for the next succeeding fiscal year is prepared for management by September 30
of each year and the current budget is revised at that time to reflect actual
events. Commencing with 1979, each department head has received monthly
management reports, which compare actual results with the budgeted forecast
for the department.
2.35      Section 26 of the Kenya Railways Corporation Act 1978 requires KR's
Board to submit to the Controller and Auditor General, who is acceptable to
the Bank, within six months of the end of each financial year, a statement of
accounts prepared in accordance with the best commercial standards. The
Controller and Auditor General is required to audit the accounts and return
them to the Board, together with his certificate and report, within suffi-
cient time to allow the Board to transmit them to the Minister for presenta-
tion to Parliament within nine months from the end of the fiscal year. It
was agreed during negotiations that KR would submit the audited accounts to
the Bank within nine months from the end of the fiscal year.
2.36      The auditor's report issued for the year ended December 31, 1978,
KR's first fiscal year, contained numerous qualifications, which for.the most
part related to assets and liabilities inherited from the EARC. These quali-
fications will not be resolved until the affairs of the East African Community
(EAC) are settled and agreed upon by the governments of the three former
Partner States, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. A mediator was appointed in 1978
to investigate and recommend an equitable apportionment of the assets and
liabilities of all EAC corporations and institutions.  This exercise is still
in progress. In addition to the foregoing, certain assets were acquired by
the Government on behalf of the Railway. These assets and the corresponding
liabilities have not been recorded in KR's accounts. For the purpose of
financial evaluation these assets, in the amount of K Sh 1.047 billion
(US$139.7 million), have been included in the assets shown in this report as
of December 31, 1978. The government has indicated that of this amount Ksh
533 million (US$71.1 million equivalent) will be treated as a loan to KR
and the remainder as equity. The respective accounts have been increased
accordingly.
2.37      KR is self-insured with minor exceptions.  This is an accepted
practice.

Ill. THE PROJECT
A. Scope of the Project
3.01      The proposed project is based upon the Kenya Government * s Five-Year
Development Plan for the fiscal years 1979-1983 and Kenya Railways' investment
plan for the same period. Part of the plan is already under implementation
with assistance from bi-lateral aid and suppliers credit, and the remaining
part, which principally covers the last three years of the plan period 1981-
1983, was reviewed with respect to the railway's implementation capacity and
economic justification. The original plan was reduced by some 30%. There are
no investments outside the proposed project.
3.02      The proposed investments are intended to improve KIVs operations and
transport capacity. The project will also help implement a training program
for staff at all levels and, by providing for studies and technical assistance,
will help the Railways review its organization and modify its operating
facilities to meet its future needs.
3.03      The project will provide for:
(a) relaying of 103 km of main line track and improving
73 km of branch line track; ballasting and formation
works; improving yards, crossing stations and buildings;
transshipment depot of Malaba; and providing for machinery,
vehicles and spare parts for track maintenance;
(b) improving the telecommunications system;
(c) purchasing hopper wagons and spare parts for locomotives
and wagons;
(d) improving maintenance facilities;
(e) improving marine services;
(f) staff housing; and
(g) extension of the training school, overseas training,
studies to improve utilization of KR's facilities, and
technical assistance at the middle-management level.
B. Details of the Project
(i) Track
3.04      Rail on the Eldoret-Malaba section (164 kin) of the main line is old
rail originally laid between Mombasa and 1airobi. It is now worn out, and 48



- 19 -
km should be replaced in the project period. Rail on curves on other sections
of the main line is also heavily worn and has to be replaced, 8 km between
kMombasa and Nairobi and 13 km between Nairobi and Eldoret, as well as anothler
34 km of rail east of Nairobi with deteriorated welded joints. In total 103
km of main line is involved. It is also planned to relay a total of 73 km of
the Nakuru-Kisumu and Kitale branch lines, using partly new and partly used
rail to replace the existing rail which is of 50-60 lb/yard standard and in
poor condition. The rail on the main line will be long-welded and, to increase
the quality of the welded joints, the project will provide for a flash-butt
welding plant. The project will also include ballasting, improvements to
yards and crossings, and a concrete sleeper plant. Included are also main-
tenance vehicles, machinery, and equipment and spare parts.
3.05      The project also provides for the construction of a new station at
Mombasa, to replace the existing station built in 1896 and to provide KR with
additional office space. Furthermore, to facilitate use of the railway by
transit traffic from southern Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, isurundi and eastern
Zaire, a new transshipment terminal will be constructed at Mialaba, KR's
terminal station on the Uganda border.
3.06      The fast growing container traffic in Kenya will require container-
handling facilites at Mambasa, Nairobi, Nakkuru, Eldoret and Malaba. KR has
agreed with the Kenya Ports Authority to jointly invest in such facilities and
the project thus provides for the KR portion of cranes and forklifts required.
(iii) Telecommunications
3.07      The 60 year old telecommunication system between Nairobi and Mombasa
is the cause of many train delays. Failures are frequent, averaging 28 per
month, and the system is out of order between 8 and 17 hours at each breakdown.
Consultants have studied the telephone network between Mombasa and Nairobi
and have recommended that KR renew the system on that section and thus
release parts for maintenance of the system's other sections. They have also
recommended the replacement of the switchboards at Nairobi and Nakuru in
order to increase the capacity of the local telephone system as well as
replacement of old equipment on stations along the line. The existing open
wire transmission system between Nairobi and Mombasa will also be replaced by
underground cable. Financing of these improvements are included in the
project.
(iv)   Locomotives and Rolling Stock
3.08      KR has covered its need for locomotives as well as general cargo
wagons for the next five to ten years. Some hopper wagons are, however,
required for increased soda ash traffic and wagons for transport of logs and
containers. The project provides for 30 wagons for the transport of soda ash,
to supplement the 110 wagons ordered. Log and container transport will be
assisted by modification of existing flat wagons and provision will be made
for furnishing 150 wagons with roller bearings, and for new cranes as well as
forklifts for handling logs.
3.09      Due to lack of spare parts, locomotive and wagon availability has
been exceptionally low for some time:  55-60% for miain line locomotives and



- 20 -
80% for wagons. The project will therefore finance the spare parts needed
to build up the stock to normal levels as well as for rehabilitation and
regular maintenance of locomotives and wagons during the first year of the
project period.
3.10      KR currently lacks sufficient emergency equipment, and two break-
down cranes of 75 tons capacity are thus included in the project.
(v) Workshops and Equipment
3.11      It was agreed during negotiations that the workshops in Nairobi,
built to handle the whole EARC system, should be reorganized following a
study of KR's future needs (para. 3.19). Certain minor improvements can,
however, be made prior to the study's completion and will be provided for
under the project. These include: (a) continuation of works to modify the
locomotive workshop from steam to diesel traction; (b) provision of special-
ized machines for repair of locomotive components such as traction motors,
auxiliary machines and generators, which must now be sent abroad; (c) provi-
sion of testing equipment for diesel locomotives; (d) replacement of old
machinery; and (e) provision of an additional foundry for melting steel scrap
into billets for the manufacture of spare parts.
3.12      The ongoing program for modification of steam locomotive depots to
diesel depots will proceed during the project period. Provision will also
be made under the project for: fuelling stations at Voi, Sagana, Kajiado
and Kisumu; extension of the Changamwe diesel depot; and rebuilding of the
carriage and wagon depot at Eldoret, which has been damaged by fire.
(vi) Water Transport
3.13      Capacity to transport agricultural products from the Homa Bay area
to Kisumu for further rail transport should be increased, and it was agreed
during negotiations that the various transport alternatives must first
be studied before any construction can begin. The project thus provides for
a study and the first phase of construction of a terminal at Homa Bay and
improvements to docks and piers between Homa Bay and Kisumu.
3.14      The marine workshops and workshop equipment at Kisumu are currently
in poor condition and will not be able to handle the planned expansion in
water transport capacity.  The project will therefore provide for urgently
needed improvements, including replacement of some machinery.
(vii)  Staff Quarters
3.15      Staff working at the Changamwe yard outside Mombasa live in
Mombasa and must find their own transport to work due to lack of public
transport facilities. Staff on early shifts are usually forced to stay
overnight in the Changamwe area or sleep on the workshop floor since no
housing facilities are provided. This lack of both transport and housing
has led many trained staff to leave KR, and as a result the wagon shop is
presently only working at one third of its capacity due to lack of staff. To
improve this situation KR plans to build staff quarters and social facilities
at a living area at Changamwe, and as a first step 296, one, two and three



- 21 -
room flats will be built. The flats are of KR standard size for the staff
occupying them and are adequate. In addition, living quarters for track
maintenance staff along the line are in poor condition due to lack of main-
tenance and should be improved. The project will provide for the new housing
facilities at Changamwe as well as improvements to other living quarters
along the line.
(viii) Training, Technical Assistance and Studies
3.1'      The railway training school, built for EARC's needs, should be
reorganized and modernized in accordance with KR's requirements, particularly
with regard to the physical capacity needed in the various training sections.
Some buildings will need to be rehabilitated, some machinery replaced and new
equipment acquired. KR is also planning a much-needed expansion of management
training at the school, for which new buildings will be required. These
buildings and equipment are included in the project.
3.17      Management training will principally take place in Kenya at the
training school, partly by Kenyan instructors and partly by visiting instruc-
tors from abroad.  Managers, mainly specialists, who cannot be trained
in Kenya will be sent abroad for training. All training is provided for in
the project.
3.18      The breakup of the EAC left KR short of trained staff, and until
the planned training program can fill this need, the services of expatriate
experts will be required. The project will therefore include 180 man-months
of technical assistance to strengthen KR's organization in the area of co-
ordination and planning, commercial services, and locomotive and rolling
stock maintenance.
3.19      The project includes a variety of studies which should also help
strengthen KR. The Railways organizational structure will be reviewed to
improve the efficiency and coordination of operations. The organization and
facilities at the Nairobi workshop will also be studied in the light of KR's
future requirement, and a study will be undertaken to identify the training
requirements of lower-level staff and to reorganize the training school area.
Finally, in preparation for development of marine services, the alternative
transport modes between Kisumu and the Homa Bay area should be assessed.
Other studies will be carried out on the transportation of specific commodi-
ties by road and rail to identify problems in the distribution system and to
formulate measures to improve the system. In addition Bank staff will review
KR's materials management system and will recommend changes if required.

C. COST ESTIMATES
3.20      The project cost is estimated as follows:
K Sh       US$ (equivalent)
(million)         (million)
Local cost                        341.6              45.5
Tax                            62.2              8.3
Total local cost                  403.8              53.8
Total foreign cost                662.3             88.3
Grand total                1,066.1            142.1
Details of the cost estimates are given on the next page.
3.21      The cost estimates are based on recent quotations and bids for
similar materials and equipment, updated to 1980 prices. Physical con-
tingencies of 20% are provided for the concrete sleeper plant, the workshop
and depots, and the training school since no detailed studies have been made
for those items. Other items can be considered as fixed. Price contingen-
cies have been provided as follows: for imported material and equipment, 1981 -
9%, 1982 - 8%, 1983 - 7%; and for local costs: 1981 - 10%, 1982 - 10%, 1983 -
8%. The man-month cost of technical assistance services is approximately
US$4,000 and for consultant-s services for studies approximately US$10,000.
D. FINANACING AND PROCUREMENT
3.22      Of the total cost of the project amounting to US$142.1 million
equivalent, the foreign cost of US$88.3 million will be met from external
borrowings and of the local cost of US$53.8 million US$2.8 million by KfW and
US$51.0 by KR from internal resources. It is proposed that the Bank Group
provide a loan of US$58.0 million to the Government of Kenya to be onlent to
KR.  The remainder of the foreign costs will be met by KfW, AfDB and the
Government of Kenya. These have been confirmed during loan negotiations.
Proceeds of the Bank loan would be onlent by the Government to KR for a period
of 20 years, including five years of grace, with interest of not less than 10%
per annum. 1/ KR would bear the foreign exchange risk. The execution of a
subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and KR, acceptable to the
Bank, has been agreed upon as a condition of effectiveness for the loan. The
proposed foreign exchange financing plan is as follows:
1/   The inflation rate in Kenya (defined as the increase in the Average
Consumer Price Index) rose from 10.4% in 1977 to 12.5% in 1979 but
declined to about 11% in 1979. Over the period 1980-82 the inflation
rate is expected to moderate from about 14% to 10%.

operational norms discussed during the field appraisal and agreed during
negotiations. They are based on the 1973 operational performance, the
last year of normal operations before the deterioration of EARC.

3.31      Tender documents for spare parts for locomotives and wagon rehabili-
tation are under preparation. All contracts will be signed before the
end of March 1982, and a detailed schedule drawn up for rehabilitation
before the end of December 1981, to be regularly reviewed thereafter. Spare
parts for regular maintenance are also provided for, which, together with the
rehabilitation program, will increase locomotive availability to 75% and
wagon availability to 90% by the end of the project period. The scheduled
track rehabilitation program and improvements to telecommunications will
reduce the turnaround time for wagons and locomotives, and hence increase
their utilization. With the estimated traffic in 1983 and the estimated
average wagon load, productivity per available wagon will increase to 260,000



- 28 -
ton-km per year in 1983 and locomotive utilization to 100,000 km per available
locomotive per year. As a result, staff productivity will also increase to
160,000 traffic units per employee by 1983, assuming the same number of staff
as in 1979. Other project items will also contribute to overall operational
improvements, provided the implementation schedule is followed.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Traffic Forecast
(i) Internal Traffic
4.01      Future internal traffic on KR will depend on many factors, including
the overall level of economic activity in Kenya, import and export growth, the
development of regions with low levels of economic activity, Government policy
on road and rail transport, operational efficiency of KR, and competition from
road transport. Bank projections of GDP growth for Kenya are 3.0% for 1980
and 3.5% rising to 5.0% between 1981-84; Western Kenya is developing parti-
cularly fast as a result of Government regional policy, and this has led
to an increased flow of traffic between Nairobi/Mombasa and the Kisumu/Eldoret
areas. With increasing tariffs for road transport, Government's policy to
encourage traffic to divert from the roads to the railways, and the increased
capacity of KR, railway traffic should increase substantially, at least over
the next few years. The ability of KR to handle the traffic should not be a
problem as, according to the traffic projections, KR will only transport the
same tonne-km of traffic in 1986 as it did in 1973. Road transport may still
offer a more reliable and faster service, and customers have been willing to
pay a substantial premium for this, but recent increases in road transport
tariffs due to higher fuel and other costs as well as enforcement of axle-load
regulations seem to be forcing more customers to consider the railways as a
viable transport alternative, particularly for exports where higher internal
transportation costs cannot always be passed on. The project includes
technical assistance for studies to determine in what ways the distribution
system can be improved; this will entail studies of major commodities
transported by road and rail to determine the most efficient mode of
transport, and measures that can be taken to encourage shippers to use it.
4.02      Projections based on commodity forecasts give an estimated traffic
growth of 4.% p.a. over the next five years, but these have been revised
downwards so as to reflect a more gradual increase, given the expected low
rate of economic growth for Kenya over the next two years. Freight traffic is
projected to increase from 1,873 million tonne-km in 1979 to 2,268 million
tonne-km in 1984, a growth rate of 3.5-4.5% p.a., and by 4.5% p.a. from
1985-1990. Thereafter, a conservative growth rate of 3% has been projected.
KR will have increased capacity and improved marketing under the proposed
project which will enable it to carry the increase in traffic. Commodity



- 29 -
projections were estimated after discussions between Bank staff and KR's
principal customers and KR itself. Agricultural goods projections have been
based on FAQ and National Development Plan projections plus discussions with
the Ministry of Agriculture.
4.03      Passenger traffic growth is projected at around 10% for 1980, 8%
for 1981, 7% for 1982, and 3.5% for 1983 and thereafter, which is just around
the projected annual population growth rate. High growth rates for 1980-82
are foreseen because of the apparent excess demand that now exists.
(ii)   External traffic
4.04      At present, a substantial amount of Ugandan traffic is transported
by road, possibly more than double the amount presently going by rail. The
main reasons for this are the limited capacity and operational efficiency of
UR and operational problems restricting the flow of rail traffic between Kenya
and Uganda. The performance of UR is expected to show slow but gradual
improvement, and several bilateral donors have already given assistance to UR
in the form of rolling stock, workshops, and wagon ferries. However, if there
is to be maximum tse of existing, TTR are KP resources, there must also be some
working agreement between UR and KR.
4.05      The Bank-s economic projections for the Ugandan economy indicate
a significant recovery over the next four to five years; however, given
the risk factor attached to these projections, a conservative traffic growth
has been assumed. Ugandan traffic for 1984 is tentatively projected at 0.5
million tonnes, compared to the present traffic level of 0.15 mil) *on tonnes
and the 1971 level of 1.4 million tonnes. This will mean an increase from 135
million tonne-km of Ugandan traffic carried by KR in 1979 to 450 million
tonne-km in 1984: a larger increase has been projected for 1985, amounting to
575 million tonne-km. Thereafter traffic is projected to increase by 10% p.a.
until 1990 and then by 5% p.a. until 2000. This will mean that even by 1990
Ugandan traffic will only be 70% of the 1971 level. With the construction of
transshipment facilities at the Uganda/Kenya border and KR's improved opera-
tional efficiency as a result of the proposed project, even if UR or operations
between UR and KR do not improve, Ugandan traffic will be able to transit
Kenya by rail.
4.06      In 1979 over 0.2 million tonnes of Rwandese and Burundese traffic
were transported through Kenya, nearly all by road, because of the situation
in Uganda and the closure of transshipment facilities at Kampala. In the
future, with the construction of the proposed transhipment facilities at
Malaba (if not the improved performance of UR), much of this traffic is
expected to transit Kenya by rail. Traffic for Rwanda, Burundi and eastern
Zaire to be transported by KR in 1984 is conservatively estimated to grow to
0.11 million tonnes (105 million tonne-km). Thereafter traffic is projected
to grow by 10% p.a. until 1990, and 5% p.a. until 2,000. This will mean that
by 1980 nearly all traffic presently going by road (0.2 million tons) will be
going by rail. Projections for all transit traffic assume that the Malaba
transshipment facilities will be constructed and in use by 1983.

B. Project Benefits and Economic Return
General
4.07      The project's main objective is to increase the efficiency and
reliability of KR's services and to thereby help expand the use of rail
transport, which is the most economic transport option for both transit
traffic and long-distance Kenyan traffic. With the establishment of KR in
1977 and the ensuing problems associated with setting up any new institution,
operational efficiency of the railways has suffered and marketing activities
have been allowed to decline. With the project KR will be able to make
effective use of its potential capacity, by increasing the effectiveness of
existing rolling stock and speeding up and improving the reliability of
railway services.  Then it z1-111w be possible to attract traffic back from
the trucks to the railways, especially if aggressive marketing techniques are
adopted.
4.08      The benefits of the proje~ct have been evaluated from a regional
standpoint, as benefits will accrue to Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and
eastern Zaire. The benefits that have been taken for the project as a whole,
and for most of its individual components are vehicle operating cost (voc)
savings, based on the assumption that if the project were not implemented
traffic would be diverted from the railways to road transport, at a higher
economic cost. Costs will vary depending on the type of traffic to be diverted
to road transport, but for the purposes of the analysis average costs have
been used. For the road, they are K Sh 0.44 per tonne-km in 1980 prices,
determined on the basis of the Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance Model.
The corresponding costs of rail transport are K Sh 0.23 per tonne-km, based on
KR-s average transport distance of 530 km. Road transport of long-distance
cargo would therefore increase transport costs by about K Sh 0.21 per tonne-km.
Shadow pricing has been applied to foreign exchange (ratio of shadow exchange
rate to par rate = 1.4) and unskilled labor costs (50% of wage).
4.09      All the major physical components of the project have been evaluated
individually to assess the benefits of each component. Because of the wagon
and locomotive over-capacity (para. 2.20) and the replacement of the tele-
communications system (para. 4.13) there will be some excess capacity over
a period of 4 to 6 years.
Track Renewal
4.10      About 176 km of main and branch line track need to be replaced
(para. 3.04), in addition to ballasting and formation works, improvements to
yards and crossings, bridges and culverts. This is essentially part of the
normal routine maintenance which has fallen behind schedule as a result of
EARC's and KR's financial difficulties. The benefits of clearing up this
backlog of maintenance will be an increase in train speed as a result of
lifting the present speed restrictions on deteriorating rail sections, and
this will improve wagon turnaround time by one day. Without the project, it



i 32 -
has been conservatively assumed that turnaround time will worsen by half a
day since track conditions will deteriorate even further. Also, without the
project traffic will be diverted to road transport, as capacity will be
reached in 1985; therefore, the benefits of track relaying will be savings
in road transport costs.
4.11      The track renewal program includes the Kitale branch line which
carried 0.21 million tonnes of freight in 1979. Existing cost data for branch
lines are not sufficient to permit an economic analysis of this sub-component
and it was agreed during negotiations that it will be done during project
implementation on the basis of a complete review of KR's costing system which
will be carried out with the assistance of consultants to be financed under
the project. Therefore, disbursement of loan funds for renewal of the Kitale
line track will be conditional upon the economic justification of the line.
Other branch lines with low traffic density carry less than 100,000 tonnes,
3% of total traffic carried by KR.
4.12      The track renewal component will also result in savings in track
maintenance costs which will be minimal for at least five years after the
project but are projected to increase by 4-5% p.a. without the project, even
with the lower level of traffic assumed in the "without project" case. In
addition, even without the project, parts of the track will have to be replaced
from 1984 onwards after complete failure. By waiting until various sections
of the track completely fail KR will be risking serious disruptions to train
services. The number of derailments would also be reduced as a result of
renewing the track, since about half of the 76 derailments on the main line
and the Nakuru-Kisumu line that occurred in 1979 were attributed to the poor
track. The reduction in the number of derailments will contribute to the
one day improvement in turnaround time, as the number of line closures will be
less as a direct result of fewer accidents. On the basis of these savings,
plus transport cost savings, the above benefits yield an economic return of
23% for the track renewal component (representing 39% of the total cost of
the project).
Telecommunications
4.13      Telecommunications failures on the Mombasa-Nairobi section of the
main line currently occur about 28 times a month, with consequent disruption
to the signalling system and closure of the line. Installation of a new
telecommunication system would result in reduced telecommunication maintenance
costs, which are expected to increase by 4-5% p.a. without the project, but
with the project would be minimal after installation until 1986. A new system
should also eliminate most of the telecommunication failures and thus reduce
turnaround time by one day on the Mombasa-Nairobi rail section, which by 1984
will account for about 50% of total tonne-km.
4.14      Although with the existing telecommunication system there will be
sufficient capacity to carry the traffic projected until 1987, the new system
has been included in the project since financing has been committed by the
Federal Republic of Germany and initial work has already begun. Under other



- 33 -
circumstances, this component would have been deferred for 3-4 years. How-
ever, even with the lack of benefits in earlier years, this investment
(representing about 4% of total project costs) still yields an economic rate
of return of 27% because of its substantial benefits in later years.
Spare Parts and Workshop Improvement
4.15      Due to a lack of spare parts and adequate workshop facilities, the
availability of locomotives and wagons is currently 62% and 81%, respectively.
By improving the workshops and purchasing spare parts under the project,
availability rates can be increased to 75% and 90%, respectively. In the
economic analysis, it is assumed that without the spare parts there would be
a decline in locomotive and wagon availability to 55% and 75%, respectively,
reducing KR's capacity and causing traffic to divert to road transport at
higher economic cost. Locomotive availability would become a major constraint
on railway capacity by as early as 1982, and wagon availability by 1984.
Altogether these capacity constraints would mean that 387 million tonne-km of
traffic would be diverted to road transport by 1982, increasing to 1,475
million tonne-km by 1988.  The economic rate of return for spare parts and
workshop improvements (representing 28% of total project costs) is 52%.
Hopper Wagons
4.16      Soda ash production, primarily for export, is projected to increase
from 230,000 tonnes in 1980 to 300,000 tonnes p.a. by 1984: plans for in-
creasing production are already well advanced. An additional 30 hopper
wagons will be needed to transport the soda ash by rail from Magadi to
Mombasa port (610 km), the only other alternative being road transport at
significantly higher economic cost. The economic rate of return on the
proposed investment for hopper wagons compared with the road transport
alternative (representing 3% of the total costs of the project) is 30%.
Malaba Depot
4.17      The Government of Rwanda and Burundi have requested the construction
of transshipment facilities at the Kenya/Uganda border, given the past disrup-
tion of rail and transshipment services within Uganda and future uncertainty
as to the restoration of such services. The proposed facilities included in
the project are only estimated to have an economic cost of K Sh 5.5 million
(representing less than 1% of total project costs). About 0.2 million tonnes
of Rwanda and Burundi freight is already going by road, and with the projected
diversion of traffic to the railway the savings from transporting this
freight by road in 1982/83 alone will more than cover the construction costs
of the transshipment facilities.
Other Project Components
4.18      KR can replace its deteriorating sleepers with either concrete,
steel or wooden sleepers. Concrete sleepers can be purchased or manufactured
by KR itself while the other types must be purchased. After comparing the



- 34 -
cost and life of each sleeper type, the least-cost solution is concrete
sleepers manufactured by KR; therefore, the proposed project includes the
construction of a concrete sleeper plant, representing about 1% of total
project costs.
4.19      The Homa Bay Terminal, estimated to cost K Sh 20 million, will not
be constructed until a feasibility study has been carried out to determine its
economic justification. Other project components, amounting to 19% of the
total economic cost of the project, could not be specifically analyzed. These
are the construction of Mombasa Station, training and technical assistance,
equipment for container depots and wagon conversion, construction of staff
quarters, and improvement of docks, piers and marine workshops. They are,
however, important to achieving the overall project objectives and have been
included in the economic evaluation of the project as a whole. The construc-
tion of a station at Mombasa is obviously required, particularly to create
office space for staff now working in makeshift offices all over Mombasa. The
training and technical assistance component is essential to improve KR's in-
stitutional strength and its operational efficiency. Equipment for containerized
traffic is needed to handle the increased volume of containerized traffic now
arriving at Mombasa Port. Staff housing, particularly at Changamwe, is needed
to help KR to retain its experienced and trained staff.
Overall Return
4.20      The project's overall economic return is 21%, including the cost of
components not separately analyzed. This return includes the cost of addi-
tional locomotives that will be necessary from 1985 to 1988 to realize all the
benefits of the project in the form of increased wagon capacity. By excluding
the cost of the locomotives, capacity will be reached in 1985, when additional
locomotives are needed, even though there would still be sufficient wagon
capacity up to 1988.
C. Risk and Sensitivity Analysis
4.21      The foregoing economic evaluation should be understood in the
context of three major risks which could alter the outcome of the project.
These include a lower than expected traffic growth rate, a lower than expected
improvement in KR-s performance and an increase in project costs. A further
factor to consider in the economic evaluation of the project is that there
could be slower than estimated savings from the diversion of traffic from rail
to road transport.
4.22      The major risk to the project is that traffic will not reach the
levels projected; therefore, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to test
the economic return in the event of a delay in the increase of Uganda traffic
beyond the 1979 level until 1985. The rate of return was still 17%. Further
sensitivity analysis reduced the projected growth rate of internal traffic to
2.0% p.a. throughout the period of analysis, plus the delay in increase of



- 35 -
Uganda traffic until 1985: the rate of return fell to 14%. The implications
of a significant drop in projected traffic levels are that some project
components, namely track renewal and spare parts, should be reduced. However,
this would in itself further affect the level of traffic going by rail as
opposed to road, because speed and reliability of rail service would continue
to be poor. This would result from the delays and disruptions to train
schedules caused by frequent accidents on the line due to the poor track, and
breakdowns of trains due to poor preventive maintenance resulting from
insufficient spare parts.
4.23      The second major risk is the slower than expected improvement in
KR's performance. Therefore, the sensitivity analysis reduced the improvement
in turnaround time resulting from the proposed project from two days to one,
and the availability rates of locomotives and wagons from 75Z and 90% to 70%
and 85%, respectively. The remaining benefits would still yield an economic
return of 19%.
4.24      The third risk is that project costs will increase.  However, even
if costs increase by 20%, the rate of return will be 18%. A combination of
20% increased costs and a delay in the growth of Uganda traffic as well as
lower than projected internal traffic would give a rate of return of 11%,
while 20% increased costs and a lower than expected improvement in KR's
performance would give a rate of return of 14%.
4.25      In the "without project case" it has been assumed that KR would
lose average cost traffic to road transport. However, in the event of
higher than average cost traffic being the first to be diverted from rail
to road transport the savings resulting from the project would be lower.
If such savings were reduced by 25% the rate of return would be 16%.

V. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. Settlement of EARC's Assets and Liabilities
5.01      The final division of EARC's assets and liabilities among the former
Partner States is still pending. A mediator was appointed in 1978 to advise
on their disposition and his proposals were submitted during March 1980.
However, the final settlement may take considerable time. Government has
authorized KR to manage, operate, use and deal with the property of EARC in
Kenya.
5.02      Until such time as the affairs of EARC are finalized the assets
and liabilities inherited by KR from EARC will not be known in exact detail.
An agreement was reached in 1976 between the partner states which allocated
the payment of long-term debts of EARC on the following basis: Kenya-48%;
Tanzania-37%; and Uganda-15%. This formula was based on the EARC assets
believed to be in each country, as revalued, at December 31, 1974. Conse-
quently KR has taken into its accounts 48% of the assets and long-term debt
of EARC. The May 1976 agreement provides that this formula is interim and
subject to retroactive adjustment when the Community affairs are finalized.
5.03      Financial accounts were maintained by EARC up to December 31, 1974.
These accounts were for EARC in total and did not present the results by
countries. Consequently data are not available for Kenya prior to this date.
5.04      KR has prepared operating statements, before depreciation and
interest, for the interim period between the de facto demise of EARC and the
incorporation of KR on January 11, 1978. These accounts are provisional and
unaudited. The operating accounts for 1978 include provision for depreciation
and interest on debt but these amounts may be adjusted according to a future
and final settlement of EARC's assets and liabilities.
B. Past Financial Performance
5.05      Prior to the period leading up to the dissolution of the East
African Community, EARC was a financially sound and self-supporting concern.
During the ten years through 1971, annual operating expenditures, before
provision for depreciation, were never higher than 75% of revenues. Only in
1972, when traffic was much affected by the situation in Uganda, and by import
restrictions in all three Partner States, did these expenditures rise as high
as 85% of revenues. During the three year period 1975-77 revenues earned by
the Kenya region of EARC covered all working expenses. However, the operating
surplus in each year is not indicative of normal operations as the railway
operated under constraints resulting from the deterioration of the East
African Community. Passenger service was cancelled for a period during 1975
and maintenance outlays were subject to the availability of funds for parts



- 40 -
and materials. As the traffic carried remained relatively constant during
these years, increases in revenues were the result of tariff increases.
During 1978, the first year of operations for KR, the audited accounts show an
operating surplus sufficient to cover the provision for depreciation and
approximately 50% of the interest expense. However, the provision for
depreciation does not include depreciation on assets acquired by the Govern-
ment for the use of KR (para 5.06). Had these assets been included in the
accounts the depreciation would have been increased by approximately KSH 50.0
million and the final loss increased by a similar amount. Details are given
in the table on page 41.
Balance Sheet
5.06      The balance sheet as of December 31, 1978, is set out on page 42.
Included in the fixed assets is an amount of K Sh 1,047 million (US$139.7
million equivalent) for locomotives, wagons and coaches purchased by the
Government for the use of KR. These assets are not recorded in the accounts
of KR. The Government has indicated that of this amount K Sh 533 million
(US$71.1 million equivalent) will be treated as a loan to KR and the balance
as equity. The respective accounts have been increased accordingly.
5.07       KR holds one sixth of the share capital of the Kenya Cargo Handling
Services Ltd. and also one sixth of the K Sh 4.6 million 6% Secured Debentures
of the Company. The debentures were due for redemption in 1976 but have not
been redeemed to date. These are shown on the balance sheet as a non-current
asset in the amount of K Sh 1.2 million.
5.08       The fixed assets are shown at historical cost.  The mediator
selected by the East African Community has revalued all assets on a current
value basis as of June 30, 1977 in his proposals which were submitted to the
former Partner States in March 1980. Until such time as an agreement is
reached the assets to be taken over by KR and their value will not be known in
exact detail.
5.09       The Railway is in a liquid position, as the bank balance and trade
debtors alone exceed the total current liabilities, and the operating surplus
covers the debt service charges by the ratio of 1.6 to 1.

C. Financial Forecast
5.10       The financial projections do not include inflation and have been
prepared using a fixed monetary unit (1979) for all revenue and expense items
with the exception of provision for depreciation. Capital items included in
the project are stated at their expected market costs at date of acquisition
and to this extent the provision for depreciation contains an element of
inflation. The following assumptions were used in the Projections:
(a)  goods revenues and passenger traffic are based on the
traffic forecasts in Chapter 4;
(b)  steam locomotives phased out by the end of 1981 and all
expenses relevant to steam traction terminated at that date;
(c)  salaries and wages increased at an annual ra e of 3% to
reflect a real increase in the wage levels unassociated
with inflation;
(d)  the cost of diesel fuel increased annually to reflect the
anticipated price increase in real terms;
(e)  water transport held constant as the future of this
service has not been determined to date;
(f)  the remainder of the working expenses broken down in
detail as to fixed and variable components. The variable
items have been increased on the basis of net tonne-
kilometers or passenger-kilometers, as the case may be;
(g)  as further investments will be required beyond the project
period to sustain KR, these have been included in the years
1984-90 in the total amount of K Sh 1,331.5 million (US$177.5
million equivalent);
(h)  the project costs are included at the expected market cost
at date of acquisition of the assets. These include the
following allowances for inflation:
Local          Foreign
1981                     10%               9%
1982                      10%              8%
1983                       7%              7%
(i)  the foreign costs of all investment items treated as long-
term debts repayable in 15 years, after a grace period of 5
years, with interest at 10% in accordance with Government
policy. Debt service payments are calculated with fixed
principal amounts plus interest.
(j)  provision for depreciation is calculated on a straight line
basis over the estimated economic life of the assets and based
on historical costs (para 5.08);



- 44 -
(k) all local costs paid from internally generated funds; and
(1) all goods revenues collected within 45 days.
D. Projected Income Statements
5.11      Based on the foregoing, KR will not show an operating profit
although operations will generate sufficient funds to allow the railway
to remain in a liquid position after the payment of annual debt service
and the local cost component of the investment plan. As KR currently covers
its fixed operating costs, excluding depreciation, a high percentage of any
increase in revenue is reflected in the operating surplus.  A summary of the
operating statement is given below and details are set out on page 45.
1981    1982      1983     1984      1985
Revenue                           653.5   703.9    744.8    823.4    887.8
Working Expenses                  516.3   507.7    521.5    542.6    575.1
Operating Surplus               137.2   196.2    223.3    280.8    312.7
Depreciation                      147.8   159.7    173.4    183.3    191.2
Net Operating Revenue           (10.6)   36.5      49.9      97.5    121.5
Interest                           72.8   123.9    146.4    155.3    165.7
Net Loss                        (83.4)  (87.4)   (96.5)   (57.8)   (44.2)
E.  Projected Cash Flows
5.12      During the project period (1981-1983) the annual cash flow will be
negative due to the heavy investment in fixed assets. Beyond that date,
positive cash flows will be generated. This is based on the assumption that
all accounts receivable are collected on a current basis as is now the case.
5.13      The projections assume that all local costs, including contingencies,
are paid by KR from internally generated funds.  Based on this, KR contributes
approximately 40% of the financing of the proposed project. The cash flow is
set out on page 46.
5.14      During negotiations it was agreed that in order to safeguard KR's
cash flow situation during the period of implementation of the proposed
project, KR shall consult semi-annually with the Government and the Bank on

the adequacy of the Investment Plan (1981-83) and if necessary make such
revisions as may be agreed upon on the basis of economic, financial and
technical studies. In addition, it was agreed during negotiations that the
Government shall periodically review and discuss with the Bank any future
investments in the railway sector which it proposes to undertake.
5.15       KR should maintain a reasonable relationship between its operating
surplus and debt service requirements. During negotiations it was agreed
that, unless otherwise agreed with the Bank, KR will not incur any debt if
its operating surplus for the fiscal year, or the twelve consecutive months
immediately before the date of occurrence, whichever is greater, would be
less than 1.5 times the maximum debt service requirements of any succeeding
fiscal year.
F. Projected Balance Sheets
5.16      The proposed project covers the three-year period 1981-83.  Based on
the assumptions set out in para. 5.10 KR will remain in a liquid position
throughout the projection period. The financing gap representing funds
required beyond the proposed Bank loan are shown in the balance sheet under
the caption "Long Term Debt-Required." All projected ratios are acceptable
and indicate that KR should experience no difficulty in not only financing
the local costs but also servicing the associated indebtedness. Comparative
projected balance sheets and a schedule of selected financial indicators are
set out in the tables on pages 48 and 49.
G. Tariff Structure
5.17      Tariffs are classified in 10 classes/groups according to wagon type,
load and distance. Oil traffic is subject to a special tariff and certain
other commodities have tariffs set by special convention. Oil accounts for
approximately 20% of total tonnes carried by KR and the special convention
commodities approximately 16%. Kenya's Five-Year Development Plan (1979-83)
states the Government's intention that tariffs be based on clearly identified
costs. In addition, high priority is to be given to ensure that traffic is
allocated between transport modes according to the most efficient means. In
order to achieve a tariff structure that will accomplish the foregoing, a
consultant was retained to design a traffic costing system and submit a report
thereon. This was agreed during negotiations.

5.18      KR's traffic costing unit requires strengthening and during negotia-
tions it was agreed that it should include three traffic costing specialists
who may be trained in costing techniques by the consultant or by a suitable
railway abroad.
5.19      As a result of the foregoing KR should implement an adequate
traffic costing system to compute its operating costs related to its freight
and passenger traffic and, based on the results of the traffic costing
unit, KR should revise its tariff structure to reflect the true costs of
operations by September 1, 1981. This was agreed during negotiations.
H. Future Financial Objectives
5.20      Section 24 of the Kenya Railways Corporation Act requires KR to
attain a rate of return of such percentage as the Minister may direct on the
value of the net fixed assets in operation. It also provides for the
revaluation of fixed assets if the amounts shown in the accounts do not
reflect a true measure of the value of the assets due to currency
revaluations, changes in prices or similar factors. To date the Minister
has not established a rate of return.
5.21      In order to generate sufficient revenues to cover working expenses,
debt service (principal and interest), and to provide for a reasonable contri-
bution towards development costs, it will be necessary for the Government
and KR to take all measures appropriate to ensure that the working ratio does
not exceed 70% commencing in 1982. This was agreed with the Government and KR
during negotiations.
I. Impact of Inflation on KR's Finances
5.22      The projected cash flow is stated in constant 1979 values except
for the amortization of long-term debt, both principal and interest, which is
shown in the actual current monetary values which will be paid each year. As
the impact of these payments on the cash flow will decrease with inflation, a
separate calculation has been made to determine the amounts involved in
constant 1979 monetary units. The total debt service payments over the
projection period of K Sh 2,319 million, in current values, will be reduced
by inflation to K Sh 1,427 million in 1979 values. The details of the debt
service deflation are given on page 51.

J. Financial Internal Rate of Return
5.23      In order to assess the financial soundness of the proposed project,
the financial internal rate of return was calculated by projecting the
operating statements of KR with and without the project, setting out the
operating surplus before provision for depreciation and interest. The pro-
jections are done in constant 1979 prices.
5.24      Without the project KR reaches its traffic and passenger carrying
capacity in 1981, hence these revenues will remain at those levels respectively.
Revenues from other coaching will be unaffected.
5.25      In order to maintain even these restricted capacity levels, the
following working expenses will go up:
(a)  track maintenance costs will increase if the renewal program
is not implemented;
(b) cost reductions from fewer accidents will not be realized; and
(c) maintenance of the telecommunication system will increase.
Fuel consumption will drop with the decrease in traffic carried, as will all
costs which are a function of tonnage or passengers carried.
5.26      Operating statements setting out the position without the project
are given on page 53. The operating surplus shown is before provision for
depreciation and interest.
5.27      The financial internal rate of return with the project investments
is 22%. The calculations are given in the tables on the following pages.
