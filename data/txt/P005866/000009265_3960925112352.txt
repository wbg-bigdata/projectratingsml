PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1222-YDR)
PREFACE
i.          This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Third
Education Project in the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (Republic of
Yemen since 1990) for which an IDA Credit (12.22-YDR) in the amount of SDR 5.3
million was approved on May 25, 1982. The Credit was closed on December 31,
1990, four years behind schedtule. SDR 4.75 million (89.6 percent) of the
Credit was disbursed, and an amount of SDR 0.55 million was cancelled with
effect from December 31, 1990.
ii.         The PCR was jointly prepared by the Population and Human Resources
Division of the Europe, Middle East and North Africa Regional Office (Preface,
Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III), and the Borrower (Part II).
iii.        The preparation of the report was facilitated by data collected
before and during the IDA supervision and identification mission in April/May
1991. The PCR is based, inter alia, on information contained in the Staff
Appraisal Report, the Credit Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence
between IDA and the Borrower, internal IDA memoranda and information gathered
in the country.
iv.         A follow-on project, the Fourth Education Project (Cr. SF019-YDR),
is nearing completion and is expected to close on December 31, 1991. Owing to
the fact that it shares and builds upon many of the objectives and initiatives
begun under the Third Education Project, detailed analysis and review of
implementation experience and results under the Third project will be
revisited in the context of the Project Completion Report for the Fourth
project.

THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
CREDIT 1222-YDR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obhectives
i.          In the contexr of a centrally planned economy, the objectives of
the project were to: (i) help alleviate urgent manpower needs by providing
appropriate facilities and equipment for the training of skilled workers and
technicians and by improving the methods and data base available to manpower
planners; xii) upgrade the skilis of existing poorly qualified teachers and
iiicrease the output of primary teachers; _nd (iii) improve the quality of
school buildings "y establishing school building maintenance units in regional
education directorates, and by determLning urgent school furniture and
equipment needs.
ii.         To achieve these objectives, the project included:  (i)
construction/extension, equipment and furniture for a Commercial Technical
Institute (CTI), an Agricultural Technical Institute (ATI), an In-service
Teacher Training Institute (ITTI), and a Primary Teachers' Training Institute
(PTTI); (ii) provision of two mobile building maintenance units; (iii) a
manpower planning study and a school inventory survey; and (iv) technical
assistance and training for strengthening the Borrower's project preparation
and implementation capacity through the provision of specialist seminars and
fellowships.
Implementation Experience
iii.        Despite some delays, project implementation was satisfactory and
the quality of Government supervision was high. With an envisaged
implementation period of less than five years, the project was originally
scheduled to be completed by December 1986. However, the Government was
unable to secure the outside financing envisaged at appraisal necessary to
implement the project, and so IDA agreed to increase its share in the
financing of civil works from its original 17 percent to 60 percent, and
eventually to 100 percent. This cofinancing shortfall also resulted in the
transfer to the Fourth Education Project (Credit SF019-YDR) of the component
covering the construction of a PTTI at Seiyun. As project implementation
progressed, construction work proceeded without major delays and, in early
'985, about 80 percent of the revised project had been completed. In
addition, during this period unforeseen savings were realized due to
fluctuations of the SDR-US$ exchange rate, and as a result, three years into
project implementation, additional activities were included in the project,
namely, the construction of a boarding section at the ITTI in Aden and the
procurement of additional printing paper for new textbooks. These late
additions to the project, coupled with delays in the manpower planning study
and confusion caused by the 1986 civil disturbance, extended the
implementation period beyond the expected completion date, leading to four
extensions of the closing date, the final one to December 31, 1990. The



- iv -
fellowship program was not executed using project funds as originally planned,
but was completed on the agreed time schedule through bilateral assistance
provided by a number of Eastern European countries. The Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) fvnctioned well and provided effective coordination
between IDA and the various agencies involved in the project.
Results
iv.         Except as noted above, all project components were duly completed.
(a)   Physical facilities for the CTI were executed as planned,
providing 750 student and 96 boarding places.
(b)   Physical facilities for the ATI at Saber were completed as
planned, providing 450 student places and eight staff houses.
(c)   Physical facilities for the ITTI at Rharmaksar were completed as
planned, providing 630 student and 96 boarding places.
(d)   Owing to the 1986 civil disturbance, sevare flooding in the late
1980s, and acute lack of funding resulting from sharply diminished
expatriate remittances, actual enrollment in the above training
institutes has been less than anticipated--about 8 percent less at
the CTI, 51 percent less at the ATI, and 73 percent less at the
ITTI.
(e)   The two mobile maintenance units were acquired and are operating
satisfactorily.
Sustainability
v.          The sustainability of this project rests primarily on two factors,
which are currently being met satisfactorily: (i) adequate funding for the
operation and maintenance of physical facilities, to be provided annually in
the national budget; and (ii) clear policy and priority action on the part of
the Government to maintain adequate quality of teaching staff, students and
graduates.
Findings and Lessons
vi          The project experience provides the following main lessons:
(a)   Cost Estimates.  The project provides a good illustration of the
importance of accuracy in estimating costs during appraisal and of
flexibility in responding to rapid changes in a country's economic
situation. The combined effects of civil unrest in 1986, the
economic development of neighboring countries, and fluctuation of
the SDR-US$ exchange rate, resulted in substantial cost savings,
which provided the basis for subsequent changes in project scope.
(b)   Financing Covenants. The Government had difficulty in obtaining
other bilateral and multilateral financing as envisaged at the
time of appraisal. As a result, amendments to the Credit
Agreement had to be authorized by IDA to increase IDA's
disbursement percentage for civil works and to move the PTTI
component to the ±lourth Education Project (Credit SF019-YDR). In



retrospect, it appears that in addition to a dated covenant to
ensure the timely prevision of project funds, it would have been
realistic to prepare a contingency ?lan in the event that the
required cofinancing was not forthcoming. For future projects,
careful attention should be paid to identifying and confirming
potential cofinancing at earlier stages of project preparation.
(c)   Studies should be included only on the basis of agreed, explicit
terms of reference, and the presence of a qualified national
counterpart team. Otherwise, as in the case of this project, they
can cause serious delays in project completion, and the studies'
findings could be less functional. Furthermore, implementation
delays can be alleviated by fostering stronger communication ties,
as necessary, between relevant government agencies, and ensuring
that the oversight authority for studies rests with the
appropriate agency. (In this instance, the Ministry of Education
(MOE) was placed in charge of the Manpower Planning Study
implemented by the Ministry of Labor and Civil Service (MOLCS).)

B. Proiect Background
Sector Development Obiectives
1.          Over the past decade and in the context of a centrally planned
economy, the Government, with bilateral and multilateral assistance, has
consistently given priority to education and training, including technical and
higher education. IDA assistance has been utilized for the development of
technically oriented education and training programs to enhance the supply of
much needed skilled and semiskilled manpower, including teachers for basic
education.
Sectoral Issues
2.          Mfjor issues affecting the country's educational development have
been: (i) shortages of trained manpower, particularly in the skilled and
technical categories; (ii) an absence of reliable data for manpower planning;
(iii) low quality of teacher training, pa:.ticularly in the more remote regions
of the country; and (iv) a need for training of Government employees at all
levels to improve the quality of planning, administration and project
management. Moreover, the regional economic growth has attracted many of the
skilled Yemenis towards the oil-producing countries.



-2-
Previous Sectoral. Initiatives
3.          The First and Second Education projects gave pricrity .o thie
enhancement of teacher training and vocational training centers (for
agriculture, industry and commerce).  This project, the Third, included the
construction and equipmenit of an Agricultural Technical Institute (ATI), a
Commercial Technical Institute (CTI), a Primary Teacher Training Institute
(PTTl), an In-service Teacher Training Institute (ITTI), two mobile building
maintenance units (MMUs), and technical assistance for studies and training,
all of which fall within the broad policy context of the Government's efforts
to improve education standards and Lo train skilled manpowver.
Linkales to l4acro Policy Ob ectives
4.          In a country w.ore the state controlled most of the productive
sectors, the project had three links to economic policy objectives: (i) the
need to upgrade the quality of teachers as a means of improving the formation
of human capital; (ii) the need to generate an increasing flow of technically
trained manpower to ease the shortages of technicians and skilled workers; and
(iii) the need to strengthen manpower planning in MOLCS, and policy
formulation in MOE.
C. Project Objectives and Components
Project ObLectives
5.    The project's objectives were in line with IDA's continued emphasis on
supporting the development of skilled manpower training programs.
Specifically, the project was designed to:
(a)   help alleviate urgent manpower needs by providing buildings and
equipment for the vocational training of skilled workers and
technicians, and by improving the methods and data base available
to manpower planners;
(b)   upgrade the skills and knowledge of existing teachers and increase
the output of new primary teachers; and
(c)   improve the quality of physical facilities by establishing mobile
maintenance units in two regional education directorates, and by
supplying school furniture and equipment.
Prolect Components
6.          The project consisted of:
(a)   Construction, equipment and furniture for:
-- a Commercial Technical Institute (CTI) at Aden;
-- an Agricultural Technical Institute (ATI) at Sabar;
-- an In-service Teacher Training Institute (ITTI) at Aden; and
-- a Regional Primary Teacher Training Institute (PTTI) at Seiyun;
(b)   provision of two fully equipped mobile building maintenance units;



-3-
(c)   technical assistance for a manpower planning study and a school
inventory survey; and
(d)   technical assistance (expert/consultant services) and a fellowship
training program to strengthen the Borrower's project preparation
and implementation capacity.
D. Project Design and Organization
7.          The project was appraised in May 1981 and negotiated in January
1982.  IDA Board approval of the Credit was obtained in April 1982, and it was
signed and declared effective in May and October, respectively, of that year.
Within the framework of a centrally planned economy and in the light of IDA
consensus that such an economy was not incompatible with labor market needs
and productivity, the project was properly conceived, effectively designed and
well prepared. Its concepts were clearly defined and understood by the
institutions and agencies responsible for implementation, and the project was
on a scale commensurate with the absorptive capacity of the sector. The
project was oriented to continue the efforts of the Government in the areas of
education and training that had started with the earlier two projects
involving IDA assistance. A distinctive feature of this project was its focus
on the need For an occupational classification system to improve the
GoverLiment's -pability to forecast specific training needs to meet future
manpower requirements.
8.          The design concepts underlying the individual components were as
follows:
(a)   The CTI  was designed as a combined complex consisting of a two-
year vocational school and a five-year technical institute to
prepare skilled workers in bookkeeping, accounting and secretarial
skills. It was well located near the main business and industrial
districts to facilitate on-the-job instructional experience, and
to assist the placement of graduates. However, businesses and
industries were not full participants in the process.
(b)   The ATI was designed to train agricultural technicians in the
fields of horticulture, agronomy and animal husbandry. Its
location near a previously IDA-financed agricultural develop .ent
project was designed to achieve economies of space, equipment and
services and thus was meant to be cost effective.
(c)   The ITTI was conceived as a national institution for the
implementation of the teacher upgrading programs and for
introducing teachers to the new curricula. The center was thus
conceived as an essential element in the continuing effort to
improve the quality of teaching staff.
(d)   The regional PTTI at Seiyun was aimed at meeting the critical
shortage of trained teachers for primary schools in remote
villages.



- 4 -
(e)   The Mobile Maintenance Units (MMUs) werIC designcd as a pilot
program for a nationwide school building maintenance system to
prcovide maintenanice assistanice, par-ticularly to sclhools where
local skilledi craftsmnern were not available.
9.          In terms of organizationi and implementat ion, thie project hiad thie
appropriate blend of devolution of respornsibility amonp, the various agencies
involved.  The PIU was competent and well staffed, and, with the exception cf
the manpower planning study (discussed below), effectively coordinated the
activities of different ministries and institutions.
10.         The implementation schedule was properly planned, yet delays
occurred in the execution of the project due to unexpected difficulties in
obtaining anticipated financial assistance from other bilateral and
multilateral sources, and in carrying out the manpower planning study.
Furthermore, the introduction at a late implementation stage of additional
items to be financed by the project extended these delays. In retrospect, the
project should have emphasized more the need for an adequate policy framework
for these components.
E. Project Implementation. Costs and Financing
11.         With an envisaged implementation period of less than five years,
the project was originally scheduled to be completed by December 1986.
However, the Go\ernment was unable to secure the outside financing envisaged
at appraisal necessary to implement the project, and so IDA agreed to increase
its share in the financing of civil works from its original 17 percent to 60
percent, and eventually to 100 percent. This cofinancing shortfall also
resulted in the transfer to the Fourth Education Project of the component
covering the construction of a PTTI at Seiyun. As project implementation
progressed, construction work proceeded without major delays and, in early
1985, about 80 percent of the revised project had been completed. In
addition, during this period unforeseen savings were realized due to
fluctuations of the SDR-US$ exchange rate, and as a result, three years into
project 'mplementation, additional activities were included in the project,
namely, the construction of a boarding section at the ITTI in Aden and the
procurement of additional printing paper for new textbooks. These late
additions to the project, coupled with delays in the manpower planning study
and confusion caused by the 1986 civil disturbance, extended the
implementation period beyond the expected completion date, leading to four
extensions of the closing date, the final one to December 31, 1990.
12.         The CTI at Aden, the ATI at Saber, and the ITTI at Aden, were
built as agreed under the project proposal--including the installation of
furniture and equipment. The School Inventory Study was completed as
originally scheduled, and the -.vbile maintenance units were acquired 4.id
became c?erational.  The Government ensured in its annual MOE budget an
earmarked amount to cover recurrent maintenance costs.
13.         There was a major delay in the completion of the Manpower Study.
This was caused by the late signing of the contract with ILO (June 1987) and
the late start of field work by the ILO expert (January 1989).  Problems arose
mainly in defining the terms of reference for the study and in recruiting a
qualified consultant. Once completed, the study was only marginally



-5-
satisfactory due, inter alia, to an inadequate national participation in
preparing the terms of reference of the study, and to the fact that manpower
development was considered the responsibility of the Government and excluded
the private sector. Subsequent revision of the study's terms of reference and
additional work by ILO on the study resulted in a final report which was
deemed satisfactory by IDA, and has been submitted for final review by the
Government.
14.         The fellowship program was not executed using project funds as
originally planned, but was completed on the agreed time schedule through
bilateral assistance provided by a number of Eastern European countries. In
addition, the envisaged regional PTTI at Seiyun was transferred from this
project to the Fourth Education Project as a response to the unanticipated
financing shortfall.
15.         Throughout the implementation period the PIU was appropriately
staffed and equipped to maintain proper records and accounts. The Unit
cooperated effectively with different project entities and with IDA.
16.         The final total cost of the project was US$8.3 million, compared
with US$20.6 million estimated at appraisal. This cost difference may be
attributed to:
(a)   Transfer of Construction of the PTTI at Seiyun to the Fourth
Education Project. Excluding the cost of these works from the
appraised project cost reduces the appraised total to US$11.1
million.
(b)   Lower than Estimated Unit Construction Costs.  The actual costs of
civil works for the CTI (Aden) and the ITTI (Aden) worked out to
be 26 percent and 55 percent, respectively, less than the
appraisal estimate, as a result of fluctuations in the valuation
of the Yemeni ainar.
(c)   Lower Costs for the Procurement of Furniture.  The actual costs of
units purchased in West Germany were 60 percent less than the
original estimates, due, inter alia, to a fluctuation in the value
of the US dollar vis-a-vis the German mark.
(d)   The non-implementation of the fellowship program under the project
saved another US$156,000.
(e)   However, new boarding facilities at Aden added US$370,000 to the
cost of the project.
17.         Due to the less than favorable regional and international support
for former PDRY, leading to insufficient bilateral and multilateral aid, the
financing plan had to be revised during implementation. As a result, IDA's
contribution to the project had to increase from 29 percent, as originally
estimated, to 48 percent to allow the completion of the project.
18.         The institutional development activities under the technical
assistance component were completed as originally scheduled.

19.         Except as noted above, all project components were duly completed.
(a)   Physical facilities for the CTI were executed as planned,
providing 750 student and 96 boarding places.
(b)   Physical facilities for the ATI were completed as planned,
providing 450 student places and eight staff houses.
(c)   Physical facilities for the ITTI were completed as planned,
providing 630 student and 96 boarding places.
(d)   Owing to the 1986 civil disturbance, severe flooding in the late
1980s, and acute lack of funding resulting from sharply diminished
expatriate remittances, actual enrollment in the above training
institutes has been less than anticipated--about 8 percent less at
the CTI, 51 percent less at the ATI, and 73 percent less at the
ITTI.
(e)   The School Inventory Study covering two governorates was completed
as planned. A further study covering the remaining four
governorates was left to be financed under the Fourth Education
Project.
(f)   The two MMUs were acquired and are operating satisfactorily.
(g)   The Manpower Planning Study conducted by the ILO expert
experienced lengthy delays.  It is worth noting that as a result
of the reunification of Yemen, both the Government and IDA agreed
to adjust the terms of reference of the study to address the new
needs, following which the study was completed. An initial
evaluation of the study led IDA to request that ILO improve the
quality of the study. ILO complied, and the final report has been
reviewed and found satisfactory by IDA, and has been submitted to
the Government for final review.
G. Proiect Sustainability
20.         The sustainability of this project rests primarily on two factors,
which are currently being met satisfactorily: (i) adequate funding for the
operation and maintenance of physical facilities to be provided annually in
the national budget; and (ii) clear policy and priority action on the part of
the Government, regarding the three Institutes under this project, to achieve
and maintain adequate quality of teaching staff, students and graduates.
H. IDA Performance
21.         At appraisal it was assumed that other donors would contribute to
the financing of the project. Considerable efforts were made by both the
Government and IDA to mobilize additional funds from bilateral and
multilateral agencies. Failure to do so affected the composition of the

(FTTI) at Sciyut' had 'L, L.- ,i,u±->'d  ',I ice Foi'l 11 FJilt o, r P 'j "I
22.         In view of this shortfall in funding, IDA agreed to increase its
share in the financing of the remaining project components, i.e., civil works
from its original 17 percent to 60 percent, and eventually to 100 percent.
This deciJion to keelp the project viable was facilitated by the fact that
actual construction costs were mucLh lower than estimated.  IDA also showed
flexibility in extending closing dates as requested by the Borrower.
23.         The overall supervision of the project was efficient and well
timed. Almost 80 percent of the staff weeks in the field were used during the
first half of the implementation period, since in the latter period there was
a decrease in project activities.
24.         In view of the lessons learned from implementation of this project
and from past performance, it is suggested that:
(a)   greater care be taken at the early stages of project preparation
to identify and confirm the possible participation of other
bilateral and multilateral agencies in project financing;
(b)   greater care be taken to enable more precise estimates of
construction and furniture costs at appraisal; and
(c)   studies be included only on the basis of agreed, explicit terms of
reference and the presence of a qualified national counterpart
team. Otherwise, as in the case of this project, they can cause
serious delays in project completion, and the studies' findings
could be less functional. Furthermore, implementation delays can
be alleviated by fostering stronger communication ties between
relevant government agencies, as necessary, and ensuring that the
oversight authority for studies rests with the appropriate agency.
(In this instance, the Ministry of Education (MOE) was placed in
charge of the Manpower Planning Study implemented by the Ministry
of Labor and Civil Service (MOLCS).)
I. Borrower Performance
25.         The presence of an efficient PIU er. ._. .' a remarkably good
performance on the part of the Borrower. During the course of project
implementation, the PIU coordinated effectively with the activities of IDA and
the national agencies involved in the project.  Any questions that required
clarification were answered and the necessary information was provided
promptly and efficiently. Consequently, most problems encountered during
implementation were quickly overcome and did not adversely affect the project
components, most of which were completed on time.
26.         A lesson drawn from this experience is that a competent PIU
Director, with adequate experience and managerial talent, along with a
competent tea., can be crucial to successful project implementation.
27.         Credit covenLants were observed and all have becn c3mrplicd with

J. Borrower - IDA Relato1onship
28.         The relationship between theo Borrower and IDA s;as excellent
thliougliout the period of project preparat ion and implementation.
K. Consulting Services
29.         Consulting services, with the exception of those necessary to
perform the studies, were not financed by IDA.  However, after verification of
the information available, it was noted tlhat consultant services were used
efficiently to carry out the agreed tasks. Two experts were engaged for the
School Inventory Study; each worked for 12 months and successfully completed
his assigned tasks.  The manpower planniiig study requircd 30 person-months of
services (six person-months more than originally planned), and there was
considerable delay in its initiation and implementation. Thie final docuLment
of the manpower planning study prepared by ILO has been reviewed by IDA and
found satisfactory, and has been submitted for final review to the Government.
Based on preliminary drafts of the study report, the Government considers that
it could provide a good basis for future manpower planning (although this is
somewhat doubtful, owing to the different geopolitical setting of today)
within the framework of the reunified, market-oriented economy.
L. Proiect Documentation and Data
30.         The project implementation was well documented.  The Staff
Appraisal Report, working papers, progress reports and supervision reports all
provided essential information to gauge the progress of the project and to
evaluate its shortcomings and achievements. The Credit Agreement was
appropriate for its purpose and the data for the PCR was readily available.
Borrower representatives provided valuable support to the project completion
mission.

PART II. PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
31.   At IDA's request, the PIU assisted in the project completion exercise.
The IDA mi.sion provided guidelines on the preparation of the completion
report and sample reports of recent missions. The PTU reviewed its records,
and discussed with the IDA misaion the additional information required.
32.   During the implementation period, IDA supervision missions visited the
country on average once every six months. The missions visited construction
sites, reviewed equipment and furniture lists, held meetings with and advised
the PIU on project executioni, evaluated performance of the technical
assistance team, and advised the PIU on IDA's procedures. In general, IDA was
responsive to the changes proposed by the Government during implementation.
Moreover, IDA used supervision missions to engage the Government in major
sectoral policy dialogues.
Changes During Implementation
33.   There were two major changes made in the project during its
implementation: (i) as a result of serious underfunding when additional
cofinancing did not materialize, one of the project items (PTTI, Seiyun) was
shifted to the Fourth Education Project (Credit SF019-YDR); and (ii) funds
remaining after the other components were nearing completion were used to
finance the construction of a boarding section for the ITTI in Aden, and to
provide textbooks for the trainees who will be taught new teaching methods and
curricula.
Project Facilities
34.       The facilities provided to the project institutions are satisfactory
and appropriate. Equipment and furniture provided is general'ly of the right
type and of high quality; they were satisfactorily installed and are well
used.
Project Cost Estimates
35.       Total project cost (US$8.3 million) was significantly lower than
estimated at appraisal for the project items remaining in the project (US$11.1
million) because of the strong US dollar du7ing implementation and efficient
and rapid project implementation.
Use of Remaining Funds
36.       Disbursement percentages against civil works were raised from the
original 17 percent to 60 percent and finally to 100 percent. The average was
about 45 percent. Because of this low average, about US$1.8 million of credit

Note: The original credit closing date was June 30, 1987. However, it had to
be extended to permit completion of the ongoing manpower classification
study and to allow for the implementation of the In-service Teacher
Training Institute in Aden and procurement of new textbooks and reacher
guides. Despite these delays, the project was successfully completed by
December 31, 1990, with about 10 percent of the allocated funds
remaining undisbursed.

Note (1)    At the time of Credit Agreement, the Government thought that it
would finance about 71 percent of total project cost through its
own and multilateral and bilateral resources. However, the
Government was unable to obtain such resources from those
agencies; hence, the original estimated contribution besides IDA
was reduced to US$2.8 million entirely financed by the Government,
instead of the originally planned US$14.0 million.
Note (2)    Government also financed about US$1.1 million for technical
assistance related to institutions.

Comments: Owing to the 1986 civil disturbance, severe flooding in the late 1980s, and acute
lack of funding resulting from sharply diminished expatriate remittances, actual enrollment in
