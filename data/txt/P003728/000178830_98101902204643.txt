INTERNATIONAl DELOPENT ASSOCLATION
REPORT AND RCOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A
SUGAR PROJECT
1.       i submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of
US$50.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a sugar industry
rehabilitation project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       The economy of Indonesia has been discussed in Fart I of my Report
and Recommendation on a proposed Development Credit for a Smallholder and
Private Estate Tea Project (dated May 29, 1973 No.P-1271-IND); the relevant
paragraphs of that Report and Recommendation are reproduced as part of
Annex I, which also contains basic country data.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA.
3.       The present status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia has been
described in my Report and Recommendation referred to in the preceding
paragraph. The relevant portion of that Report and Recommendation is also
reproduced as part of Annex I. Annex II contains a summary statement of
IDA Credits and IFC investments, and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
PART III - THE INDONESIAN SUGAR INDUSTRY
4.       Agriculture is the mainstay of the Indonesian economy, accounting
for 50 percent of GNP, almost all non-oil exports and 65 percent of
employment. Landholdings on the densely populated islands of Java and Bali
are vezr small, and highly intensive rice culture predominates. Agricultural
developnent on the outer islands has concentrated on estates and smallholder
production for exports, and on rainfed fooderop cultivation.
5.       A Bank Group agricultural sector mission visited Indonesia in
February and March 1972 and recommended, for Java and Bali, that emphasis
be given to increasing efficiency of smallholder production through
irrigation and improved provision of other agricultural inputs. The sector
report confirms that continued emphasis should be given to the improvement
of rice cultivation but stresses that there is considerable scope in some
areas for increased production of other cash crops, including sugar. The
report endorses the objective of sugar self-sufficiency because of Indonesia's
comparative cost advantage and because the amounts of land involved are small
and therefore do not significantly affect xice targets. The report also
points out that rehabilitation of the sugar industry has lagged considerably
behind rehabilitation of other agricultural sub-sectors and is attractive
for productive investment.



2-
6.       The Indonesian sugar industry, located entirely in Java, used to
be one of the wXorld's largest and most productive, with annual output of
3 million and exports of more than 2 million tons. Production began to
decline during the depression of the 1930's and was further disrupted by
disturbed conditions during World War II and the post-independence period.
In 1957, nearly all sugar factories were taken over by Government and they
are now grouped geographically into eight Perusahan Negara Perbebanan (PNP -
State-owned enterprises). Prior to World War II, sugar was produced from
more than 200,000 ha; today only about 135,000 ha are under cane for white
sugar production, though possibly another 50,000 ha are cultivated for crude
bro-n sugar. Average yields in the 1930's were 137 tons cane/ha (TCH) and
16.2 tons sugar/ha (TSH); sugar content was 11c8 percent. This compares
wiv'. the 1965 - 1970 averages of 93 TCH, 9.1 TSH and 9.8 percent sugar
content. Yields and cane production improved moderately in 1971 and 1972
and should continue to do so, especially with the assistance and demonstration
that would be provided by the proposed project.
7.       The Indonesian sugar industry is unique in that it depends almost
entirely on land leased to factories by smalholders, one planting season
(16 months) at a time. The land is cultivated by the factory with its own
supervising staff and hir ed labor. Land-leasing farmers are given a
preference in employment. After one planting, land reverts to the owners
for two seasons of rice and other crops. Amnnual rent, presently set at a
base rate of Rp 80,000 per ha (US$192 equivalent), is regulated by Government
and is based on the value of land for rice production. While this rotational
system provides both equity and security to farmers, it necessitates special
systems of water control to accommoda-te the different needs of rice and
sugar production, increases transport requirements to service a more
extensive production area, makes it difficult to ratoon (growing cane from
the stubble of the previous crop) and leads to higher sugar production cost.
The system has nevertheless operated successfully for many years.   Due, in
part, to favorable soils and climate, sugarcane is more profitable than
rice or other foodcrops, but lack of technical knowledge and credit
discourages many farmers from growing cane on their own.
8.       Most sugar factories were constructed in the 19th century and
rehabilitated in the 1920's.  The average annual sugar production of
15,000 tons per factory is low compared to the 100,000 tons produced by
modern units.  Because they are run-down and lack spares, many factories
operate below installed capacity and production is generally limited to
about 120 days instead of a more normal 180 days per year, mainly because
breakdown is feared if the old machinery is made to run longer.
9t ~     Cane is usually transported to factories by light railway.  Rail
track is in five different gauges, making linkage difficult. Haulage is
still mainly by steam locomotive, though diesel units are being introduced.
Road and rail communication with the ports of Surabaya and Semarang are
good.
10.      Sugar consumption per head has grown from about 6 kg in 1962 to
about 8 kg in 1972 and in total is expected to continue to grow somewhat
faster than production. Average consumption in Asia was about 7.5 kg per
head in 1969, Annual sugar exports, which averaged about 90,000 tons
durinn; nthe early 1960's, have since been replaced by .imports reaching



- 3 -
200,000 tons in 1972. Sugar, both from imports and Government factories,
is marketed by Badan Urusan Logistik (BULOG), a non-profit GOI agency, which
attempts to ensure regular supplies and stable consumer prices. It distributes
sugar by quota to some 300 licensed wholesalers, for resale within specified
areas. Marketing is characterized by inefficient distribution which has
resulted in artificially high prices; however, the Government is attempting
to improve the system and, for example, recently established buffer stocks
at consumption centers.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
11.      In January 1971, at the request of the Indonesian Government, the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) commissioned the Indonesian
Sugar Study (ISS), for which the Bank was Executing Agency, to formulate
a ten-year program that would meet domeatic sugar demand at least cost to
the economy and to prepare a project for international financing. ISS
prepared an initial three-year project comprising major expansion of one
and construction of two sugar factories and rehabilitation of twelve others,
with ancillary transportation and agricultural facilities. The Association's
appraisal mission, which visited Indonesia in October/November 1972, concluded
that the major rehabilitation of three and minor rehabilitation of twelve
factories would be less costly, show a better rate of return and increase
sugar supply by about as much as ISS proposed. Subsequently, the Government
and the Association agreed on a phased program under which in addition to the
major rehabilitation of three factories, the minor rehabilitation of twelve
factories would be prepared, but only six would be implemented under the
project, since finance for the balance would only be required by the middle
of 1975. The additional funds needed could then either be included in a
second IDA credit or obtained from other IGGI sources. The Asian Development
Bank is presently considering financing the major expansion of one high
priority plant recommended by ISS and one or two minor rehabilitations.
12.      Negotiations for the proposed credit were held in Washington from
May 7 to 11, 1973. The Government's delegation was headed by Mr. Muluk
Lubis, the Director-General for Estate Agriculture in the Ministry of
Agriculture. The appraisal report is being circulated to the Executive
Directors separately. A credit and project summary is contained in Annex III.
Project Description
13.      The project consists of:
(a) the major rehabilitation, over four years, of
three designated sugar factories at Sragi
(Central Java), Pesantren and Gempolkrep
(East Java);
(b) the minor rehabilitation, over five years,
of about six sugar factories in Java, and
preparation of six others for subsequent
implementation; the final selection of
these factories would be made by agreement
with the Association;



(c) associated agricultural and cane transportation
improvements;
(d) extension services and credit for cane farmers; and
(e) consultant services to provide management, training
and engineering assistance to the Government sugar
enterprises, strengthen the appraisal capability
of the Bank Bumi Daya (BBD), the State Bank
responsible for assisting agro-industries and
estate agriculture, provide research services to
the Pasuruan Research Station and to carry out
feasibility studies and prepare a program for
additional sugar production in Indonesia.
14.      Major rehabilitation of factories would include improved cane
transportation, handling and storage facilities; boilers of modern design;
steam t-rbines to drive the mills and generators for electrical drive of
ancillaries; increase in milling speed and capacity, and improvement in
conveyor systems; improvement and expansion of juice handling and
processing equipment; modernization of the sugar extraction plant; and
electrification and modernization of workshops. Although many factories
could meet minor rehabilitation criteria, twelve have been identified as
a first choice for consideration by the Association, subject to more
detailed appraisal provided for under the project. All factories will
generate their own power from steam boilers fired with bagasse    the waste
left after sugar and molasses have been extracted from the cane, because
they are widely dispersed and linking them to public power sources would
increase the cost of power.
15.      The project would markedly improve the output of rehabilitated
sugar factories, not only by enabling them to process more cane daily, but
also to process cane for longer periods each year.   Increased production
estimates are based on large increases of cane area. Sufficient suitable
land is expected to be available, but adequacy of cane supply to meet
forecast capacity is critical to project success and depends on many
factors, such as the value of alternative crops, availability of irrigation
and farmer attitude. Before rehabilitation of any factory is carried out,
therefore, a survey satisfactory to IDA, would be carried out to determine
whether sufficient suitable land would be available to provide an adequate
supply of cane. The Government would ensure that minimum rental levels
are annually set so as to provide sufficient incentive to landowners to
lease their land. The Government would keep the Association informed of
the basis of an-nual rent determination.  In addition, previous regulations
have been changed to permit factories to extend their land leases from 16 to
at least 28 months and to permit ratooning of cane. Cane farming by small-
holder farmers would also be encouraged and factories would organize small-
holder production by providing extension services and helping farmers to
obtain credit from Bank Rakyat Indonesia, the state bank concerned with
nrral credit.
16.      Cane transportation would also require substantial improvement to
accommodate the increased loads and extended production areas. About 170 km
of new track would be installed to provide access to new lands, and 264 km



of old track would be replaced or rehabilitated. New diesel locomotives
would replace omrn out steam locomotives, new rail cars -would be added and
old cars overbauled.
17.      Research is vital to the success and future development of the
sugar industry. Accordingly, the project would strengthen the Pasuruan
Research Station, by providing consultancy services, new research equipment
and overseas orientation and training tours for research staff.
Organization
18.      The Badan Chusus Urnsan (BCU) in the Ministry of Agriculture has
responsibility for all PltPs and has tried to control and coordinate, with
insufficient staff, a widespread system of estates growing a nmber of
different amps. This system has led to conflict and lack of PHP management
initiative. Decentralization and consolidation is needed to provide
independence and a greater sense of initiative, responsibility and cost
consciousness at the operating levels. The l-overnment plans to consolidate
the eight sugar fPPs by the end of )975 into four coamercially oriented
Perseroan Terbatas (PT - an enterprise established under the ccmercial code).
Each PT would have a Supervisory Board (Devan Komisaris) comprising a
chairman, a member - finance, a member - sugar industry and one or two other
members with a regional background. To facilitate coordination and
consistency in supervision, the first three members would preferably be
comnon to the Supervisory Board of all sugar ?Ts. Responsible to this
Supervisory Board would be an Executive Management Board (Direksi), comprising
a first director, directors for field production, factory production and
finance, and a Comptroller. Each PT would se responsible for factories in
a particular geographical region and the direct management of field and
factory operations. No IDA funds would be disbursed for an individual
factory until it had been transferred to a PT. The chaiman and the member
- finance of the Supervisoryr Board and all members of the Xarwareenl ?oard
would be appointed after comsultation with the Association.
19.      In order to ensure economies of scale and coordination of comnon
activities, the sugar FNPs would enter into a Joint Agreement to form a
Joint Sugar Projects 'Unit to handle matters of common concern, including
coordination of rehabilitation and organization of procurement. In addition,
the Unit would make arrangements with consultants, satisfactory to the
Association, to provide engineering services and management assistance to
the individual PTs, which would assume the PIIP obligations as soon as they
were fonned. An initial task of the engineering consultants would be to
help the PT8 prepare detalled plans for the factory rehabilitations.
Conditions of credit effectiveness are that the Joint Agreement is entered
into by the PNPs, that the Joint Sugar Projects Unit has contracted for
engineering services and that the two PTa concerned with the three major
rehabilitation sub-projects have been formed.
20.      Common policy issues for the sugar industry need to be considered
on an industry-wide basis. Examples include legislation and regulations
concerning the industry, production planning, marketing, land rental and
sugar prices. Such policy matters would be dealt with by a Standing
Committee for Sugar (SCS), which the Government has agreed to create as an
inter-departmental committee with a penmanent secretariat not later than
January 1, 19T4. The Government intends to set the price of sugar so as



- 6 -
to provide an adequate and stable income to sugar factories, cane farmers
and landowners leasing land for sugar cane production, and to provide
consumers -with sugar at stable and equitable prices. Suitable measures will
be taken to discourage abuses of the sugar marketing system.
Project Cost and Financing
21.      Total estimated project cost is US$81 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of $52 million. The proposed IDA credit would
cover 96 percent of the foreign exchange requirements. The Government
would provide the balance, mainly for fertilizer and permanent working
capital, from its own resources or from program aid.  US$29 million
e.iLralent needed in local currency will be provided by the Government,
mainly from sugar industry earnings.
22.      Total project cost, broken down by local and foreign exchange and
major project components is shown below:

Total Project Cost                  52.0      29.0    81.0      64
23.      The Government would lend the bulk of the proceeds of the IDA credit,
as well as its own contribution, to the Bank Bumi Da,ya (BBD) which would
relend the funds to the PTs. Lending to BBD and to the PTs would be for
15 years, including 5 years of grace. The PTs would pay interest at a rate
of 12 percent per annum; BBD would pay 11 percent per annum to the Government.
Since the Government owns the PTs, and would bear both the foreign exchange
and the default risk under the project, BBD would retain only a 1 percent
per annum agency fee on the funds channelled to the PTs; this would be
sufficient to cover its costs. BBD would retain consultants to help in the
appraisal of sub-projects submitted to it by the PTs.
Procurement
24.      Procurement of factory and field equipment (US$31 million) would
be by international competitive bidding, in accordance with Bank/IDA guide-
lines except for purchases of less than $25,000.  Purchases of similar items
for several factories would be grouped into larger contracts and procurement
wo-uld be organized by and channelled through the Joint Sugar Projects Unit.
A preference margin of 15 percent or the actual tariff, whichever is less,
would be granted to qualified local manufacturers.  Contracts for installation
and civil works wo '   e let after competitive bidding among local contractors



- 7   -
who are quite experienced. These contracts would be for irrigation works
(Us$0.3 million), road improvement(US.$07million) and buildings (US$0.7 million)
and would be widely scattered and low in unit value.
Economic Benefits
25.      Incremental production of white sugar from the project would reduce
the country's requirement for sugar imports by 190,000 tons annually
(15 percent of current production) by 1978, thus saving about $41 million
per annum in foreign exchange. The estimated rate of return for the
project is 26 percent. Sensitivity analyses indicate that even under
unfavorable assumptions regarding sugar prices, costs and milling periods,
the rate of return would not fall below 12 percent.
26.      Ty 1978, an estimated 30,000 additional farmershaving an average oF less t
0.5 ha each would rent land to project sugar factories and another 5,000
would switch from other crops to sugar cane production. Farmers' income
would increase by at least 10 percent over present levels if they rent
their land to the factories and by up to 55 percent if they take on the
added risk of growing cane on their own.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
27.      The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Indonesia and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association
and the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft Agreement
conforms to the iormal pattern for credits for agricultural projects.
28.      I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECCWMENDATION
29.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

EXCERPT FR(a REPORT AND RECOMMNDATION
NO. P-1271-IND, DATED MAY 29, 1973
(SMALLHOLDER AND PRIVATE ESTATE TEA PROJECT)
PART I - THE EGON=
2.         The latest Bank report on Indonesia, (Development Issues for
Indonesia, December 1, 1972: R73-6/1) contains a discussion of recent
economic developxents, but addressed itself principally to longer-term
policy issues relevant to the Second Plan (1974478) now in preparation.
Country data are presented in Annex I.
3.         Indonesia's economic progress over the five years ending 19TL
has been satisfactory. The rate of growth of GDP, averaging 5 percent per
year in 1965-70, reached 6-7 percent in 1971, but was probably lower in
1972 when food production, particularly rice, was severely affected by
drought. Rice imports to meet the shortages in 1972/73 are estimated at
1.2 million tons, up from 530,000 tons in the preceding year. Mainly as
a result of these shortages the cost of living indices escalated towards
the end of 1972 so that prices at the end of December were 26 percent high_Uic-
than a year earlier, interrupting the relative price stability achieved
and maintained since 1969. However, secondary price effects have so far
been limited. Rice prices declined in the first quarter of 1973 and the
general price level also fell slightly.
4.         In the industrial sector, there has been further substantial
growth in the production of textiles as well as of other consumer and
industrial goods. The rehabilitation and expansion of domestic enterprises,
backed by a continuing inflow of private investment and commitments of
official aid for several major industrial projects, suggests that the prospects
are good for further industrial growth from the present small base.
Infrastructure rehabilitation and expansion is underway, financed in large
measure by project aid, including IDA credits. Deficiencies in the transport,
power and telecommunications sectors, however, could become a constraint o.
agricultural and industrial growth unless special efforts are made to accelerate
the implementation or, ongoing and future projects.



ANNEX I

-2-
5.         In the public sector, Government revenues in 1971/72 were 20
percent higher than in the previous year. A much larger increase, in the
order of 45 percent, will be realized in 1972/73. The largest item in this
increase would be taxes on expected higher earnings of foreign oil companies.
Other revenues could increase by up to 20 percent. The expected increase
in revenues of Rp 160 billion (US$387 million) after financing increases in
salaries and material expenditure in the routine budget, would allow for a
doubling (to Rp 135 billion or US$326 million) of the surpLus available for
the development budget. Together with counterpart funds generated by program
aid (estimated at Ip 97 billion or US$234 million) this provided for a
rupiah development budget in 1972/73 of Rp 232 billion (US$560 million),
which was 48 percent more than in 1971/72. In addition, project aid disbursements
in 1972/73 are estimated at Rp 62 billion (US$150 million).
60         The balance of payments situation has improved steadily. Exports,
led by oil, have expanded at an unprecedented rate in recent years, but imports
have also risen rapidly. Recorded exports from Indonesia rose by over 30
percent in the last two years, and they increased even more in 1972/73, reaching
about US$1,935 million, largely as a result of shazp increases in the volume
and value of oil and timber exports. Foreign exchange reserves increased
rapidly in 1972, from formerly very low levels, and reached e net level of
$285 million at the end of December 1972. Gross reserves then amounted to $489
million, equivalent to about three months of total imports at 1972/73 rates
and an increase of $345 million in the year. The changed situation resulted
partly from good export perforsance, partly from an inflow of capital attracted
by high Indonesian interest rates but largely also from the utilization of
foreign loans contracted in 1972 by state enterprises, notably Pertamina, the
national oil company. The Government has since taken steps to ensure effective
control over the amounts and purposes of short and medium-term foreign borrowing,
which under the new IMF standby arrangements agreed on 1ay 4 will be substantially
less r-n the coming year than the obligations incurred last year.
7¢ ,The Government is now in the process of assessing Indonesia's past
performance and future economic potential as part of its preparations for the
Second Plan. This Plan will address more directly than was possible in the
rehabilitation phase the issues of employment, income distribution and regional
development. Although the ability of the Indonesian iGovernment to formulate
and implement plans, programs and projects has improved, limited managerial
capacity presents a serious obstacle to more rapid growth. This problem,as well
as the continued need to improve the mobilization of domestic savings, will
alnso have to be considered in the formulation of the Plan.
8.         Bank Group assistance to Indonesia is a part of the international
support being given in increasing amounts through the IGGI. Aid commitments
have risen from less than US$200 million equivalent in 1967 to over US$600
million for 1971/72. The proportion of project aid has steadily increased
over this period, but substantial program aid remains essential as support

-3-
for the balance of payments and - in spite of strong domestic revenue
efforts - as a source of additional funds for the development budget. For
1572/73, express or implied commitments made by IGGI members amounted to
some US$724 millian equivalent, of which US$320 million was for program
aid, including US1O million in food supplies. In December 1972, the
IW0I accepted as reasonable and realistic, in terms of Indonesia's needs,
a request for $760 million in new aid commitments in 1973/74. Of the total,
$160 million was requested in food aid with the other $600 million for
project and non-food program aid. On My 7, 1GI member countries and ageneies
announced intentions to provide non-food aid amounting to $720 million in
1973/714. Even after allowance for recent currency realignments, this
substwatially exceeds the Indonesian request. Efforts will be made in addition
to ensure the timely availability of food aid in the required amounts.
9.         The soft average terms of foreign assistance in the IGGI framework,
and the rescheduling of pre-1966 external debt obl-igations (under the 1970
Paris Club agreement with the Western countries and Japan and parallel
arrangements with several Eastern uropean contries) have kept Indonesia's
public debt service ratio relatively low, for 1973 estimated atll percent of
exports. The capacity to service external debt will, however, cont;nue to
be limited by the sise of investment income transfers arising from foreign
investment in oil, hard minerals, forestry and manufacturing which amounted
to 14 percent of exports in 1972 and will increase substantially through the
1970's. The maintenance of low official debt service ratios during the decade
will depend on the continued availability of concessional aid, restraints
on short and medium term foreign borrowing not directly related to export
growth, and the further substantial increases in exports which are now projected.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDOINEIA
10.        In order to accelerate the pace of economic development, Indonesia
will require substantial external support for rehabilitation and improvement
of infrastructure and expansion of production capabilities in agriculture,
minerals, forestry and manufacturing. It will also require continued strength-
ening of the institutions for the planning of development and the management
of the economy. Welfare and income distribution, including family planning,
as well as regional development and related patterns of employment and population
movements, also need to be given an important place in Indonesia's development
strategy.
11.        The work of both the Resident Staff in Indonesia and at Headquarters
and the lending activities of the Bank Group have been oriented towards these
development objectives. The focus of the Bank's economic work in providing
assistance to the Government in the current preparation of Indonesia's next
five-year plan is also along these lines.

12.         Consistentu with Indonesia's low per capita income, large external
resource requi.rements. and liinited debt servicing capacity, the Bank Group' s
lending to Indonesia (aside from IFC investments) has been and will probably
conitinue for saxe tine, to be in the fonm of DA credits. In recognition of
the urgent need for institutional reforms, most IDA-financed projects have
been associated with major reorganizations of existing institutions or the
esta'blishment of new ones, and most credits have -included appropriate
urov1ision for consultant services.
13.         Ui to the end of April, 1973, Indonesia has received 26 IDA
cred-its amourting to US$34105 million. Annex II contains a sumary statenmetof IDAk
credits and JYC investments as of April 30, 1973 and notes on the execution
of on-going projects. The composition of this lending reflects the priorities
for' rehabi itation and development established by the C0veilment. Indonesia' s
First Firve Year Elan (1969-74t) gives highest priority to agriculture. The
Assocj.atie.n has alreacr extended four credits to help rehabilitate and
develop plantations inr the Goverrnment estates sector. Other credits for
agriculture incluide four to assist rehabilitation of irrigation systems and
one each for a fisheries Droject, a seeds multiplication Program, beef cattle
development in the outer islands and smallholder rubber development in
Sumatra. In addition., the Association organized a consortium of lenders to
fLnzance a major extension of the Pusri Fertilizer Plant.
14.         Other priority sectors to which credits have also been extended
include power, transportation, telecommunications, industry, education and
3oc1ationL In a- ,i tion, three technical assistance credits have been made
t-o finance preinvestment studies undertaken by the Goverrnnt, which have
helped to establish investment priorities over a wide range of activities,
and r;rovide other urgently needed technical assistance, Since April 30 credits
mojmuiiting to US$78.5 million for projects in power generation, primary
teducat.1on and highways as well as an increase of US$5 million in Credit 193-IND
(Pusri Fertilizer Expansion) have been approved. Credits to Pinance an
-^ne'ustrial estate and. sugar industry rehabilitation are expected to be
pre.sented to t7he Za-ecutive Directors in the next seve,ral months. Projects
-n irrQgAt,ion, teleco' n unications, and tourism are urnder preparation.
1%          The first TDA credit to Indcuesia was made in September 1968, and
more than half of all credits have been made since July 1970. The program is
thus new, and the undisbursed portion of the credits is relatively large.
Virtually every credit has been associated with extensive institutional reforms
involving, inter alia, the creation of new project authorities, drafting of
new chartersand enactment of new legislation, all of which have taken, in
most cases, much time. Several credits - including the first two for agricultural
est+ates projects - have experienced delays in disbursement because of management
prob' ems.

16.          Both because of the limited absorption capacity of project agencies
and the need in the initial stages of lending to Indonesia to assist in a
number of sectors, IDA lending was spread over a relatively large number of
fairly small projects. Now that the program has substantially expanded, our
assistance will in general concentrate more heavily on consolidating what has
already been started, through a smaller number of larger loans to project entities
already familiar with Bank Group procedures. New initiatives will be limited to
a few projects which support the Association's overall lending strategy of
building up vital institutions of high economic and social priority. This
consolidation is expected to reduce the Government's needs to staff new or
substantially reorganized project agencies and to make more manageable the Bank
Group's responsibility for supervising projects in Indonesia.

C.         PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Cr. No. 127  Irrigation Rehabilitation; US* Million Credit of Se teer 6
P968T nlosing Date: June 30, 1974. 
This credit was for the purchase of earth moving equipment required
for rehabilitating three irrigation systems in Java and for the construction of
a fourth in South Sumatra. While all equipment supplied under the project is
being well utilized and disbursements are within 98 percent of the appraisal
timetable, the actual cost of the rehabilitation will be considerably higher
than was estimated during appraisal, as a result of the unforeseen need to include
substantial drainage works under the project. This increase in project cost
is bei.g7 financed by GOI. Project completion will be delayed by about two years
due to this additional required work, but the economic rate of return will
still be above 20 percent.
Cr. No. 135 Technical Assistance; US$2.0 Million Credit 0ff December 27) 1968;
ClostinDate: January 31, 1974.
The preinvestment studies financed by this credit are progressing
satisfactorily and the credit is nearly fully committed, In order to complete
disbursements for ongoing studies, we have recently agreed to postpone the closing
date for one year, to January 31, 1974.
Cr. No, 154 Iihways; US$28 Million Credit of June 20, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1973.
This credit finances equipment for highway maintenance and a specific
highway rehabilitation program. Initial delays in project execution arose from
the unfamiliarity of the Indonesian officials with Bank procurement procedures
and adainistrative inefficiencies in disbursement of local funds. The project
is now progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 155   gricultural Estates; US$16 Million Credit of June 20, 1969;
Closing Date: June 30 
The project is about one year behind the original schedule due to
.initial delays in appointing management advisors and visiting inspectors, lack
of suitable planting material in the early stages of development and an unforeseen
sharp fall in rubber prices which seriously restricted the availability of self-
generated funds. Adequate supplies of good quality planting material are now
becoming available so that by the end of 1974 oil palm planting programs should
be on target. There has also been a recovery in rubber prices in recent montbs
and the availability of self-generated funds will be much less of a problem in
1973. While there have been improvements in plantation work leading to increased
production, weak and inexperienced management continues to be a problem and the
impact of foreign advisors has been mixed. Improvewents are also needed in
budgetary procedures, financial and operational control and overall organization
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the progress
of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems which are
being encountered, and the action being taken to remecr them. They should be

present a balanced ev-.alustion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

in the estates sector. Government has taken two steps to improve the situation.
First, in November 1971, it agreed to an IDA-prepared Aide-Memoire on PNP
management problems, including action timetable for implementation of specific
improvements by July 1972. As a result reporting and accounting procedures have
been improved, but management control is still deficient. Second, Government
commissioned a study by management consultants to determine a system for effective
supervision and control of Government-owned estates. The recommendations of the
report are now being reviewed by the Government and we expect to discuss a
timetable for implementation of reforms in the next several months.
Cr. No. 165 Electricity Distribution: US$15 Million Credit of October 29, 1969,
Closj__ Date: December 31, 1973.
This project is progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 193  PUSRI Fertilizer Expansion: US$35 Million Credit of June 15, 1970
(as amended _Ny 1973); Clo~sinite: December 31,     97~
Implementation of this project began nearly a year later than
anticipated in the appraisal report because of the time required to meet all
the conditions of effectiveness, to select contractors on bid specifications
acceptable to all co-lenders, and to negotiate contracts satisfactory to all
parties. Since the conclusion of the contracts, Part I (construction of an
ammonia-urea fertilizer complex with an annual capacity of 380,000 metric tons
of urea) has progressed well and the contractors, spurred on by a penalty-bonus
arrangement, are now ahead of the new schedule. Part II (construction and
installation of a natural gas gathering system and a 65-mile transmission line
to the fertilizer complex for use as feedstock and fuel and to serve other
industrial users) has also suffered delays, but the construction contract has been
awarded and the system is now expected to be completed by February 1974, when
the fertilizer plant needs gas for plant testing.
Current estimates of capital cost show an increase of about 25
percent over the appraisal report figures. Part I shows an increase of 17 percent,
due to currency revaluations and changes made necessary as detailed design
progressed and the true composition of the gas supply became known. Part II
has been enlarged to increase transmission of gas, in part to meet the increased
needs of the fertilizer complex but also to supply a greatly increased usage by
Pertamina for its refineries and by power plants. This has increased the cost
of Part II by about 78 percent, but has lowered the cost of gas to the fertilizer
complex since the system throughput has been increased by 104 percent.
Current estimates indicate that these factors will result in
increased foreign exchange costs of US$20.2 million equivalent, including contingencie
and a potential bonus for the general contractor if he completes the facilities
ahead of the agreed schedule. AID,, OECF and IDA have agreed to contribute US$4.0
million, US$4.5 million and US$5.0 million respectively to help finance the foreign
exchange cost overrun. The Government will cover the balance required to complete
both parts of the project.

Despite the capital cost increase, the project has become more
remunerative. The economic rate of return has increased from 14 to 21 percent
and, because of recent, market developments a faster build-up of sales and
higher market prices can be expected than assumed in the appraisal report.
Cr. No. 194  AFLiul.ural Estates; US$17 Million Credit of June 15, 1970j
Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
The crnments are generally the same as those for Credit No. 155.
Cr. No. 195   Irrigation Rehabilitation II; Us$18.5 Million Credit of June -5
--~~~ 1~970; ClosQigDate: oeme 30 19Th.-
This credit was for the rehabilitation of the Jatiluhur system in
West Java covering 186,000 ha. An autonomous agency Otorita Jatiluhur was
established to administer the project. After a slow start due to problems with
preparation of teider documents and difficulty in obtaining acceptable bids,
work is now proceeding and the project could still be completed on schedule
provided that good contractors win the last two contracts. There are no serious
cost overruns, but due to the above difficulties disbursements are presently
behind schedule.
Cr. No  210 _1 elecomunications nxpnsion; US$12.8                   ofllionlCredit o   uz 13,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1974.
After a slow start due to procurement difficulties the project
is now progressing satisfactorily. Orders for all equipment, except the
tropospheric scatter system, have been placed. The management consultants
retained to study the telecommunications authority and recommend remedial
measures have conpleted their work and have also been retained to implement
the recommendations.
Cr. No. 211 Fisheries; US$365 Million Credit of July 13, 1970j Closing Datet
This project is part of an overall program to develop export-oriented
skipjack tuna fishing. It consists of construction and equipment of freezing
and cold storage facilities, the construction of a wharf in Aer Tembaga, the
purchase of 30 wooder vessels for pole and line fishing, and two refrigerated
carriers to transport frozen tuna to export markets. The project provides technical
assistance to support the program. Although operations of the project unit,
the 5tate f'isheries Enterprise, have been inefficient, the recent appointment
by Government of new management acceptable to IDA is expected to improve the
situation, and overall prospects for successful implementation nave improved,
pa rt-Jcularly since there is an upward trend of world market prices for skipjack
tuna.

This project is progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 219  Education; US$4.6 Million Credit of November 6, 1970; Closing
Date: December 31, 1976.
Implementation of this project fell a year behind schedule due to
delays in the GovernzDut's evaluation of consultants and to uncertainties regarding
the liability of foreign contractors and consultants for Indonesian income tax.
A contract with consultants was signed in June 1972, and the project is now
progressing satisfactorily.
fir. No. 220  Irrigstion Rehabilitation III; US$14.5 Million Credit of November 6,
lY70; Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
This credit is for rehabilitation of three irrigation systems covering
200,000 ha, two in Java and one in South Sulawesi. Construction is presently behind
schedule due to initial difficulties in recruiting expatriate staff, problems with
the preparation of contract documents andover-extension of local contractors due to
the large volume of construction involved. Although some improvements in project
execution is expected, it is still estimated that the project's completion date
will be 2 to 3 years behind the appraisal report estimate. Overall project cost
estimates have increased by 15 percent and GOI has made arrangements to meet this
cost overrun. Despite the cost increase and the delay in implementation, the
economic rate of return for the project remains satisfactory.
Cr. No. 246  Seeds; US$7.5 Million Credit of May 1   1971; Closing Date: September
This credit for the establishment of facilities for growing, process rng
and distributing high yield varieties of rice and other seeds is behind schedule due
to delays in organizing nanagement and the effective procurement. A March 1973
supervision mission reported that these constraints are being overcome, but due to
delays mentioned above and recent exchange rates adjustments, project costs are
likely to be considerably higher than appraisal report estimates. The effect of
this cost over-run is presently being evaluated.
Cr. No. 259 Tea; US$15 Million Credit of June 24, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
