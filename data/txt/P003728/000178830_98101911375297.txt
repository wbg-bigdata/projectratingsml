APPRAISAL OF SUGAR PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project for rehabilitation of nine sugar
factories, owned by the Government of Indonesia (GOI), including associated
agricultural and cane transportation improvements, extension services and
credit for cane farmers, engineering services, technical assistance, and
feasibility studies for additional sugar production.
ii.       The Indonesian sugar industry is unique.  It depends on land
leased to factories one season at a time, by many thousands of peasant
farmers. Located entirely in Java, and more than a hundred years old, it
/used to be one of the world's largest and most productive, with annual
output of 3 million (M) tons of sugar, two-thirds for export. Production
began to decline during the 1930's and declined still further during World
War II and subsequent disturbed conditions so that by the 1960's production
was down to an annual 600/900,000 tons. Imports replaced exports from the
early 1960's and are estimated at about 200,000 tons for 1972.
iii.      The emphasis of Indonesia's 1974-78 Five-Year Plan, now in
preparation, will be on agriculture, with high priority for programs aiming
at national self-sufficiency in basic commodities, such as rice and sugar,
which can be produced competitively in Indonesia. The recent Bank Agricultur-
al Sector Survey endorses the priority for sugar, partly because the amounts
of land involved are small and do not significantly affect rice production
targets. It points out that rehabilitation of the sugar industry has lagged
considerably behind rehabilitation of other agricultural subsectors and is
attractive for productive investment.
iv.       IDA has made 26 Credits to Indonesia totalling US$342 M, of which
13 totalling US$159 M, were for agriculture, mostly for Government estates
and rehabilitation of agricultural infrastructure, which were the immediate
priorities. More recently, Credits have been made for seed production,
fisheries, beef cattle, and smallholder rubber and tea. The agricultural
projects are significantly improving production, though managerial problems
persist and frequent supervision is necessary.
v.        At GOI request, UNDP commissioned the Indonesian Sugar Study
(ISS) in January 1971 to formulate a ten-year program to meet domestic sugar
demand, at least cost to the economy, and prepare a project for international
financing. This appraisal report recommends rehabilitation of factories,
rather than construction of new ones, proposed by ISS, which would be very
expensive (US$25-30 M each) and difficult to justify under Java conditions.
Three major and six minor rehabilitations are included in the project.
The Asian Development Bank is considering concurrent financing of one other
major and one or two minor rehabilitations.



- ii -
vi.       GOI sugar factories are owned and operated by eight units known
as PNP, for which policy decisions are reserved to the Ministry of Agricul-
ture through a unit (BCU) responsible for many diverse enterprises, which it
cannot control properly. GOI proposes to consolidate the eight sugar PNP
into four commercial corporations (PT) and to create a policy-making and
coordinating Standing Committee for Sugar (SCS).
vii.      Three major and two minor rehabilitations would be planned in the
first year for implementation over the next three years; four minor rehabili-
tations would follow one year later; and four more would be planned for
implementation when funds become available. Project costs are estimated at
US$81 M equivalent, of which about US$52 M (64%) would be foreign exchange.
IDA would contribute US$50 M (62%) in foreign exchange, with GOI providing
local costs (36%) from its own resources and the small balance of foreign
exchange costs (2%) from its own or other, e.g. bilateral aid, resources.
viii.     A Joint Sugar Projects Unit would be created to provide common
services to GOI sugar factories and help coordinate rehabilitation. Consultants
specializing in sugar projects and design engineering would help to plan and
execute rehabilitation. Others would provide management advisory services
to PT, and technical assistance to: the Bank Bumi Daya (GOI agent for ad-
ministration of loans in the Government estate sector); the sugar industry
research station; SCS - for the feasibility studies. Training would be an
important part of their services.
ix.       All contracts in excess of US$25,000 for factory and field equipment
(total about US$35 M) would be by international competitive bidding, in
accordance with Bank/IDA Guidelines. Irrigation works (US$0.3 M), road improve-
ment (US$0.7 M) and buildings (US$0.7 M) would be widely scattered, low in
unit value, and would be financed by GOI, or by PT from self-generated funds.
Procurement for these items would be by local competitive bidding.
x.        Rehabilitation would markedly improve factory output and enable
about an additional 17,000 ha to be brought into sugarcane production.
It would substantially improve the return from existing investment and
the return from project investment would consequently be high. The
estimated financial rate of return is 23% and the rate of return to the
economy, 26%. The project would increase annual earnings of about 35,000
farmers between 10% and 55%, depending on their present circumstances and
whether they prefer to lease land to the factories or take the risk of growing
and supplying cane themselves.
xi.       The project would, after about five years, result in an additional
annual 190,000 tons sugar (reducing imports at that time by a like amount)
and 60,0nn tons molasses (all for export) together worth a net annual US$41 M
to the economy. It would thus help produce a basic food and save foreign
exchange.
xii.      The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$50 M.



INDONESIA
APPRAISAL OF SUGAR PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Indonesia (GOI) virtually controls the country's
entire sugar industry. It wholly owns and operates 48 out of 55 sugar
factories, and has a part interest in 5 of the remaining 7. In January 1971,
at GOI request, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) commissioned
the Indonesian Sugar Study (ISS) 1/ to formulate a ten-year program to meet
domestic sugar demand, at least cost to the economy, and prepare a project
for international financing. The Bank was Executing Agency.
1.02      ISS prepared an initial three-year project comprising two new
sugar factories, and major expansion of one and rehabilitation of twelve
others, with ancillary transportation and agricultural facilities. Appraisal
has established that new factories would be too expensive (US$25-30 M each)
and could not be justified at the present time. Major rehabilitation of
three and minor rehabilitation of six is recommended instead. This would
substantially increase sugar supply, at less cost. The Asian Development
Bank is considering concurrent financing of the one major expansion recom-
mended by ISS and one or two minor rehabilitations.
1.03      I-DA has made 26 Credits to Indonesia, totalling US$342 M, of which
13, totalling US$159 M, were for agriculture. Four were for rehabilitation
and development in the Government estate sector. The first and second, in
1969 and 1970, totalled US$33 M for four rubber and oilpalm enterprises in
North Sumatra. The third, in 1971, was US$15 M for tea estates in West Java;
and the fourth, in June 1972, was US$11 M for rubber and oilpalm in South
Sumatra. Other Credits for agriculture were for: production of high
yielding seed; irrigation rehabilitation; and fisheries. A US$30 M Credit
for fertilizer production was made in 1970. The projects are significantly
improving production, though many initial difficulties and delays, stemming
largely from managerial problems, have not been fully resolved, and frequent
supervision is necessary. In FY73 Credits of US$3.6 M have been approved for
beef cattle and US$5 M for smallholder rubber. A smallholder and private
tea estates project (US$7.8 M) is about to be submitted for Board considera-
tion. Further details are in Annex 1.
1.04      These Credits are in keeping with a strategy of rehabilitating ag-
ricultural infrastructure, restoring foreign exchange earnings and increasing
production by supplying inputs (such as seed, planting material and fertilizer)
and improved processing facilities. The project likewise conforms with this
strategy by rehabilitating a key industry, saving foreign exchange, and
increasing (or making more secure) the income of many thousands of peasant
farmers.

1.05      This report is based on the findings of an IDA appraisal mission to
Indonesia in October/November 1972, comprising Messrs P. G. Nelson, S. Bhatia
and S. Thillairajah (IDA), H. Idehara (sugar processing consultant) and
D. Young (sugar agricultural consultant); and on data from ISS. The mission
was greatly assisted by the Bank Resident Staff.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      The Indonesian archipelago of 1.9 M km2 has a population of
about 120 M, increasing at approximately 2.5% per year. About 70% live in
the islands of Java and Madura; 17% in Sumatra. Urbanization is low at about
12%. GDP has grown at about 6% per year in recent years, though still very
small at about US$80 per capita. Agriculture contributes about 50% of GDP
and of earnings from exports, consisting principally of rubber, timber, coffee
and palm products. Petroleum has become increasingly important, contributing
about 40% to export earnings in 1971/72 (US$590 M out of US$1,375 M) and
expected to grow substantially.
2.02      1969-73 Five-Year Plan objectives were rehabilitation of basic
infrastructure and productive capacity. The 1974-78 Five-Year Plan, now in
preparation, will emphasize agricultural development and stress self-suffi-
ciency in basic commodities, such as rice and sugar which can be produced
competitively in Indonesia. The February/March 1972 Bank Agricultural Sector
Survey endorses priority for sugar, partly because the amounts of land in-
volved are small and do not significantly affect rice production targets.
It points out that rehabilitation of the sugar industry has lagged consider-
ably behind rehabilitation of other agricultural sub-sectors and is attractive
for productive investment.
B. Government Estates
2.03      The Government estate sector has been discussed in several previous
reports 1/. Briefly, 1968 reorganization and partial decentralization resulted
ili 28 Perusahan Negara Perkebunan (PNP) being formed, each with an Executive
Management Board. Many important powers are retained by the Ministry of Ag-
riculture's Badan Chusus Urusan (BCU) which, with insufficient staff, attempts
to control and coordinate units growing a wide range of crops. A final stage,
already begun with some IDA projects, is conversion of PNP into Perseroan
Terbatas (PT), operating under the commercial code, each with a Supervisory
1/   E.g. PA78b May 4, 1971 Part II B and C and Annex 1; PA-138 June 9, 1972
Part II B and C and Annex 2.

Board representing shareholders and monitoring the performance of its          v
Executive Management Board.
2.04      Serious management deficiencies hamper progress of the sector and,
in an attempt to correct them, an IDA financed management survey was made,
including the BCU/PNP/PT organization. A timetable for implementation of
its December 27, 1972 report is being drawn up and the consultants who made
the survey have been retained to introduce the management information systems
they recommended.
C. The Sugar Industry
'and Use System
2.05      The Indonesian sugar industrylocated entirely in Java, is unique,
depending 6fft-zid-.leMto f5actori es, on at a time, in
con  act-- -ithey'd6iitres wnere land is conStZinuously under cane,           
large!%'tates.' Suga'r production could not have been developed on permanent
estafesain crowded Java without serious social disruption and reduced food
supplies (Annex 2, paras 11-14). The present system therefore evolved,
whereby sugar factories lease land in concession areas from thousands of
farmers on a one-third rotation for 16 months (one season); it then reverts
to farmer  frtwo'7e&±s tinder rice and-othfier-crops. -PGM  cannot therefore
grow (ratoon') cane in -the following year from th'estubble of the previous
year's crop, and cane must be freshly planted each year.  The very different
irrigation and drainage requirements of rice and sugarcane also demanded a
special system of planting and cultivating rice and sugarcane consecutively
on the same land (Reynoso system - Annex 2 para 16). Though well suited
to the labor surplus economy of Java, it is not ideal for sugar, but has
worked successfully for many years; no alternative land use system has yet
been devised that would be economically and socially acceptable in Java.
2.06      Rent is regulated by Government, and is presently a basic
Rp 80,000/ha with various premiums, based on cane yield and prompt vacation
of land, making it up to about Rp 100,000 (USS240). In principle, rent is
decided by September, for land to be planted the following March or April,
one half of the basic rent is paid in October, the rest when land is vacated
for sugarcane. The cumbersome (though fair) procedure for fixing rent is
described in the ISS Report (Appendix E13). Briefly, the Minister of Home
Affairs issues a yearly Regulation setting minima, based on rents paid
locally for other purposes, and maxima, based on returns from alternative
crops (opportunity cost). In practice, there are often variations above the
maxima officially set. Furthermore, decision is often delayed and the farmer
is told too late what rent he may expect; land is thus frequently in other
crops when it should be ready for cane. In general, taking into account the
high opportunity cost of capital, rent is about equal in value to net income
from alternative crops; and without risk. Nevertheless, though factories have
the right to rent more land in their concession areas than they presently use,
improvements in rent setting and regulation are required, if enough land is to



- 4 -
be made available, with certainty, for expanded cane supply on fair terms to
farmer lessors.
2.07      Cane farming is generally more profitable to farmers than growing
rice or other crops, but is not widely practiced because farmers lack tech-
nical knowledge and the credit to tide them over crop growing time (about
ten months). Some farmers ratoon cane and sell it to middlemen who supply
their credit needs and arrange delivery. To introduce numerous small farmers
to sugarcane cultivation, however, requires organizational, financial and
educational changes that cannot be quickly made. Furthermore, there are
risks in cane farming, different from those in farming more familiar crops,
and many farmers would prefer the certainty of rent (which provides them
with valuable working capital finance) to the uncertainties of cane produc-
tion. At the present stage, also, factories need land under their own control,
to give them assured minimum cane supply and to act as a nucleus for trial and
demonstration of improved methods. While desirable, therefore, the expansion
of cane farming needs to be cautiously approached.
Production and Consumption
2.08      Sugarcane culture and sugarcane growing in Java are described in
Annex 2; sugar processing in Annex 3. Sugars produced are "plantation
whites", slightly yellow compared with refined sugar, but quite satisfactory
nutritionally and readily accepted on the Indonesian market. Most sugar
factories were constructed in the 19th century and rehabilitated in the 1920's.
Average annual sugar production per factory is low by international standards
only 15,000 tons, compared with 100,000 tons for a modern unit. Many facto-
ries operate below installed capacity because they are run-down and lack
spares. Though maintenance is very good, it takes a long time to carry out
between seasons; and milling is generally curtailed to about 120 days, instead
of a more normal 180 days per year, mainly because breakdown is feared if the
old machinery is made to run longer.
2.09      The Indonesian industry used to be one of the world's largest and
most productive, with annual output of 3 M and exports of more than 2 M tons.
Production began to decline during the Depression of the 1930's, and declined
still further during World War II and subsequent disturbed conditions. Im-
ports became necessary from 1966. In 1957, nearly all sugar factories were
taken over by Government and they are now grouped geographically into eight
PNP. Prior to World War II, sugar was produced from more than 200,000 ha;
today only about 135,000 ha are under cane for white sugar production, though
possibly another 50,000 ha are grown for crude brown sugar. Average yields
in the 1930's were 137 tons cane/ha (TCR) and 16.2 tons sugar/ha (TSH); sugar
content was 11.8%. This compares with 1965-1970 averages of 93 TCH, 9.1 TSH
and 9.8%. Yields and cane production improved in 1971 and 1972 and should
continue to do so moderately for all units, especially with project demonstra-
tion; but they are still a long way short of 1930's achievement.
2.10      Annual average sugar production for 1962-66 was 653,000 tons and
for 1967-71, 720,000 tons, an increase of less than 2% per year. Consumption
per head, with general economic development, increased from about 6 kg in 1962



to about 8 kg in 1971. Average total annual consumption for 1962-66 was about
600,000 tons and for 1967-71 about 790,000 tons, an increase of about 5.75%
per year. During the next decade, consumption is expected to continue growing
somewhat faster than production. Annual sugar exports averaged about 90,000
tons during the early 1960's. They have since been replaced by annual imports,
estimated at about 200,000 tons for 1972.
Marketing
2.11      Badan Urusan Logistik (BULOG), a non-profit GOI agency, is respon-
sible for marketing sugar from Government factories and imports, and intended
to ensure regular supplies and stable consumer prices. It distributes sugar
by quota to some 300 licensed wholesalers, for resale within specified areas,
but suffers serious shortcomings (Annex 4).
Prices
2.12      GOI controls ex-factory prices and indicates retail prices of
sugar. Although Indonesia is partially isolated from the world market by
Government controls, its sugar prices are influenced by world trends.
International free market sugar prices are liable to wide and frequent fluc-
tuation. The averages (per ton cif London) increased from US$110 in 1970
to US$155 in 1972, mainly due to poor sugar crops in USSR at this time and
in Cuba (Annex 4). Late 1972 prices were as high as US$250 but have since
receded somewhat. Indonesian sugar prices have followed approximately the
same pattern, ex-factory prices rising from Rp 4,700 to Rp 6,450 per bag
(100 kg) (equivalent to US$113-155/ton) and indicated retail prices from Rp
85/kg to Rp 100/kg during this period.
III. PROJECT AREAS
Geography and Climate
3.01      The project area is mostly in East and Central Java (Maps 10285/6),
where sugarcane is extensively grown, generally below 100 m elevation. An-
nual rainfall varies between about 950 and 2,950 mm, with the relatively
wet season from December to April (Map 10034). The climate is favorable to
sugarcane, despite occasional drought (Annex 2).
Soils and Irrigation
3.02      Soils are volcanic and, being free draining and fertile, are very
suitable for cane. Almost all the area growing cane is irrigated, subject
to regulation (particularly as to quantity) by the Government irrigation
service. Many dams, canals, rivers and drains are being re-built, cleared
or repaired to provide not only more irrigation water, but also (important
for cane) better wet season drainage.



- 6-
Transport and Communications
3.03      Cane is usually transported to factories by light railway, though
track is in five different gauges, making linkage difficult. Haulage is
generally by steam locomotive, but diesel units are being introduced. Road
and rail communication with the ports of Surabaya and Semarang are good (see
Maps 10285/86). Telephone communication, however, is poor.
Labor
3.04      Labor supply is usually adequate, though some factories need to
transport and house seasonal workers. The minimum seasonal cash wage
is Rp 85 daily; transport, accomodation and other costs bring the total
up to about Rp 100/day (25 US cents). Permanent workers, mostly unskilled
factory labor, earn a minimum Rp 138/day; with fringe benefits and an annual
production bonus, average total cost is about Rp 190/day. Skilled workers
are trained on the job and appear adequate in number. Monthly salaries are
low, ranging from Rp 15,000 (US$36) for foremen to Rp 50,000 (US$120) for
junior executives and Rp 150,000 (US$360) for managers; but they are tax-free.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      The project aims to increase Indonesian sugar production, replacing
imports, through rehabilitation of nine cane sugar factories that have be-
come run down and out-dated. It includes feasibility studies for additional
sugar production. It would be part of a continuing program to modernize the
industry, for which GOI is also seeking assistance from the Asian Develop-
ment Bank and bilateral aid sources. The project is:
(a) the major rehabilitation, over four years, of three sugar
factories at Sragi (Central Java), Pesantren and Gempolkrep
(East Java), increasing annual capacity by 1.1 M tons cane;
(b) the minor rehabilitation over five years of six other
sugar factories, increasing annual capacity by 0.8 M tons
cane, and preparation for minor rehabilitation of six more;
(c) associated agricultural and cane transportation improvements;
(d) extension services and credit for cane farmers;
(e) the provision of engineering services, together with technical
assistance for appraisal, improved operation and research, and
staff training; and



- 7 -
(f) feasibility studies to determine the next phase for
additional sugar production.
B. Detailed Features
Rehabilitation
4.02      Criteria for rehabilitation would be:  sufficient suitable land
available to supply a minimum increase in annual cane throughput of 125%
(major rehabilitation), or 80% (minor rehabilitation); farmers nearby willing
to lease land for one plant crop and lease land for, or grow, one ratoon;
equipment that can be rehabilitated to accommodate increased throughput; and
transportation that can be readily improved or expanded to carry the extra
crop.
4.03      Details of proposed major rehabilitation are in Annex 5 and, in
summary, would comprise:
(a) improved cane transportation, handling and storage;
(b) new and replacement boilers of modern design;
(c) steam turbines to drive the mills and new generators
for electrical drive of ancillaries, in place of
old steam engines and belt drive;
(d) increase in milling speed and capacity through in-
creased power, minor design changes, and bearing
replacement;
(e) improvement in conveyor systems;
(f)  improvement/expansion of juice handling and processing
equipment;
(g) modernization of sugar extraction plant;
(h) electrification and modernization of workshops.
4.04      Minor rehabilitation would vary somewhat according to the needs
of particular factories, a few of which have pieces of relatively new
equipment. Nevertheless, since they are mostly of similar design and
age, it is possible to prepare a typical rehabilitation plan, detailed in
Annex 6. Steam and electrical power generation would be the main items
(about 50%); also included would be: cane handling and milling; electrifi-
cation of factory and workshops; modernization of sugar extraction plant;
and improvement of instrumentation and control systems. Many factories could
meet minor rehabilitation criteria, and many would remain for a further
project, following successful completion of this one. The first choice
(Annex 6) is based on ISS-recommendation and discussion with GOI.



-8-
Production Parameters and Cane Supply
4.05      The project would markedly improve sugar factory output, not only
enabling more cane to be processed daily, but also to be processed for longer
periods each year. Estimates are based on large increases of cane area
(Tables in Annexes 5 and 6), varying from 70% for minor rehabilitation to
200% for Sragi. Sufficient suitable land is expected to be available; but
adequacy of cane supply to meet forecast capacity is critical and depends on
many factors, such as the value of alternative crops, irrigation availability
and farmer attitudes. Rents are estimated to increase by 10% but, before any
rehabilitation is planned, a survey, with terms of reference satisfactory to
IDA, would be carried out to determine whether adequate land would be availa-
ble for forecast cane production, at rents providing a sufficient incentive
above basic opportunity cost of land, having regard to the ability of the
industry to pay. Draft terms of reference are at Annex 7. IDA would be in-
formed of the amount of, and the method of determining, annual rent. Suitable
assurances were obtained at negotiations.
Project Size and Phasing
4.06      Project size is based on the need to make a sufficient impact
on the industry and meet domestic sugar demand to the extent possible,
having regard to funds, and management and contracting resources, available -
including contractors to remove and install machinery - and the number of
factories that consultants might reasonably be able to handle over three or
four years. There would be economies of scale and of continuity of technical
assistance and supporting services. It is also important that the project
be large enough, other constraints permitting, to induce management and
institutional reforms throughout the sugar industry. Plans for the three
major and two minor rehabilitations would be made in the first year, for
implementation to begin during calendar 1974; four minor rehabilitations
would follow one year later; and six more would be planmed for implementa-
tion when funds become available. Each rehabilitation would normally take
about 36 months to complete from the date of placing orders (Chart 7352).
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that all plans would be submitted to
IDA for review.    would be supported by the consultants' recommendations.
Land Use and Cultivation Practices
4.07      Pending promised legislation, the Ministry of Home Affairs has
issued a regulation permitting factories to lease land for 28 months inside
or outside their concession areas and to permit ratooning of cane, by either
factory or farmer. Minimum rents would be determined as in para 4.05.
4.08      PT cultivation practices would be improved, as recommended in the
ISS report and endorsed at appraisal. In summary, ISS recommended: improved
irrigation and drainage (para 3.02); earlier planting; more fertilizer trials
and more extensive application of results; better disease control, particularly
removal of infected planting material from nurseries; greater control of pests,
particularly top and stem borer; cleaner harvesting.



- 9 -
4.09      ISS also recommended, as very significant, the introduction of
improved planting material (including new varieties), and this would be done
as soon as such material became available from tle Pasuruan Research Station,
as strengthened under the project. Substantial increases in yield/ha are
forecast from these improved practices, but sugar content would increase only
slightly, for technical reasons. At a later date, as suitable varieties and
methods are developed, it should be possible to vary planting times, so that
cane reaches maturity in different fields over a longer period, and sugar
content would be improved.
4.10      Cane farming by smallholders would be encouraged by:  establish-
ment of an extension service at each project factory, comprising a senior
agriculturist with approximately one assistant for each 250 ha covered; and
provision of credit by Bank Rakyat, which is willing to cooperate. Credit
would be on lines similar to the present GOI BIMAS program for high yielding
rice and would cover the cost of inputs and some living expenses (equivalent
to part of the value of the farmers' labor) during the period to crop maturi-
ty. Interest would be 1.25%/month (compared with 1%/month for BIMAS).
Credit would be recovered by deduction from the proceeds of cane deliveries
(see Annex 8).
4.11      At Srag_ and Gempolkrep, wnich now have virtually no farmers'
cane, up to 350  ta would be grown (about 30% of the ratoon crop, '10% of
the total). A-I. esantren, farmers' cane would be increased from 1,600
to 2,0)O h7.   `WzLost all the ratoon and 35% of the total).  At other project
factories, a start would be made with 200 ha (20% of the ratoon, 7% of the
total). These are modest objectives, for reasons stated in para 2.07, and
cane farming would develop during this and subsequent phases of the moderni-
zation program according to experience gained in this initial effort. At
negotiations, assurances were obtained that: extension would be provided by
the factories, and credit by Bank Rakyat, in a manner acceptable to IDA; a
senior staff member of each PT owning a project factory would be engaged full
time on establishment and operation of cane farming. It would be a condition
precedent to commitment to IDA financing of any factory rehabilition that
arrangements for cane farmers to supply that factory, with details satisfac-
tory to IDA (similar to Annex 8), had been made.
Technical Assistance
4.12      Consultants would: help plan and implement factory rehabilitation
(engineering services); assist in appraisal of specific investment proposals
(appraisal for Bank Bumi Daya (BBD)); provide financial, factory and field
advice (management); assist in soil surveys, cane breeding, variety selection,
disease control, ratooning and cultivation trials (research); and undertake
feasibility studies of new sugar areas. All would be expected to train staff
on-the-job, and specific provision is made for training by engineering services,
management and research consultants. These services are estimated to total
US$4.8 million over five years. In addition design engineering consultants
would be needed to prepare plans for and assist in supervision of the rehabi-
litation work, estimated to amount to 5% of the capital cost, or a total of
US$2 M. Details are in Annexes 9-11 and 13 (Table 5).

Further Studies
4.13      For later phases of a ten-year program for development of the sugar
industry, the project includes feasibility studies to be carried out by con-
sultants with special reference to new areas, particularly outside Java.
Annex 11 discusses the prospects for new areas and has draft terms of reference.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations, that consultants acceptable to IDA
would be appointed, with terms of reference and upon terms and conditions
acceptable to IDA; and it would be a condition precedent to commitment of IDA
funds for the feasibility studies, that they had been appointed.
Working Capital
4.14      Incremental working capital, in the form of stocks and stores,
(particularly fertilizer), and cash for wages and salaries, is included as
part of the project cost and would be financed by the sugar factories.
C. Cost Estimates
4.15      Total estimated five-year project cost is Rp 33.6 billion (US$81 H),
including contingencies, of which about US$52 M would be the foreign ex-
change component. Details, summarized below, are in Annexes 12-16.

4.16      Estimates are based on findings during appraisal, with guidance
from the ISS Report. By its nature, there could be unforeseen additions to
major rehabilitation when machinery is dismantled for detailed inspection
(not possible during appraisal). 7% is therefore added to equipment and 5%
to construction work as physical contingencies. 5% is also added to agricul-
tural equipment and fertilizer to cover possible changes in specifications and
quantities; and 20% to engineering services and technical assistance to cover
possible variation in cost, particularly in the man-months required. Minor
rehabilitation is based on a typical model and is less likely to result in
significant unforeseen costs especially since some factories already have im-
provements which would result in savings and provide a contingency element in
the overall estimate, based on model cost. No provision is therefore made for
physical contingencies on minor rehabilitation. Physical contingencies total



- 12 -
about 6.7%. An annual price contingency totalling about 24% is included,
made up from a compounded 5% for local and 7% for foreign costs, based on
presently estimated inflation rates, internally and externally (after recent
US$ rate adjustments), and on probable national sources of procurement.
4.17      Changes in US dollar exchange rates, since appraisal, have been
taken into account. Major items such as boilers and electrical equipment,
were expected to come most probably from the Netherlands and Japan; there
is strong international competition for these items and a 7% increase in US
dollar equivalent was added to them, and should be adequate. Where com-
petition is less certain 10% was added; and between 3% and.5% where procure-
ment from countries less affected by the changes seemed likely. Details
are in Annex 13.
4.18      Income taxes, if any, levied on consultants' fees and salaries would
be excluded from amounts requested for disbursement by IDA.
D. Financing, Procurement and Disbursement
Financing
4.19      Proposed financing (Annex 16) is based on IDA providing the equiva-
lent of up to US$50 M (62%) in foreign exchange costs, the maximum available
for this project in FY73, with Government providing the local costs, largely
from sugar industry earnings (36%) and, the small balance of foreign exchange
costs (2%) from its own or other e.g. bilateral aid, resources. A summary

4.20      BBD is GOI agent for loans in the estate sector and would undertake
debt service accounting and appraisal of minor rehabilitation sub-projects.
It would onlend the IDA credit to PT for 15 years, including five years' grace,
at 12% per annum, subject to early repayment without penalty. This is in line
with current long-term rates for development and, assuming a 5% average in-
flation rate, is equivalent to a real rate of about 6.5%. BBD would collect
an annual fee from GOI (not more than 1%) for its services. Suitable assur-
ances were obtained at negotiations, including assurances that no change
would be made in these terms without prior consultation with IDA, and that
BBD would retain a consulting firm, acceptable to IDA, with terms of reference
and upon terms and conditions acceptable to IDA, to help carry out the above
appraisal, which would be subject to review by IDA before commitment. GOI
proposes to carry the foreign exchange risk, rather than pass it on to PT
with a lower interest rate.
4.21      Financial implications for Government are illustrated in Annex 17,
and rehabilitation cash flows are in Annex 18, which shows that PT would
have no difficulty in repaying BBD from net incremental revenue generated by
the project, except that Pesantren might need to draw on total rather than
incremental revenue to meet the 15-year schedule.
Procurement
4.22      Purchases of similar items for several factories would be bulked into
single contracts, whenever feasible, and procurement would be organized by and
channeled through a Joint procurement service (para 5.05). For contracts
above US$25,000, procurement of factory and field equipment to be financed by
IDA (total about US$35 M) would be by international competitive bidding, in
accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines. Other equipment purchases, of relatively
minor items, would be in accordance with sound business practice.  Experienced
local contractors are available for installation, to be let by competitive
bidding. Irrigation works (US$0.3 M), road improvement (US$0.7 M) and build-
Lngs (US$0.7 M) would be widely scattered and low in unit value; they would
be financed by GOI, or by PT from self-generated funds, and would be subject
to local competitive bidding.
4.23      Appropriate assurances were obtained at negotiations, including
assurance that: draft tender documents and bid analyses for all contracts
exceeding US$250,000 would be submitted to IDA for approval, before contracts
were awarded; and Engineering Services (para 4.12 and Annex 9) would assist
in preparation of bidding documents and specifications and report in detail
on bid evaluation for rehabilitation items, together with their recommendations
for award.
Disbursement
4.24      IDA would disburse against cif documents for imported goods.  For
goods supplied off the shelf, IDA would disburse 83%, representing the ex-
factory price net of Indonesian duties and taxes. IDA would also pay the
foreign exchange cost of expatriate staff engaged for the project, on the
understanding that tax on emoluments would be paid by PT. Suitable assurances
were obtained at negotiations. A disbursement schedule is at Annex 19.

V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Government Policy
5.01      PNP operate under the direct control of the Ministry concerned.
Appointments of senior executive staff, approval of budget estimates, and
major policy decisions, are presently reserved to the Minister of Agriculture
through BCU. Long-term funds are normally provided by direct contributions
from the budget; short-term funds by BBD or from the budget. Following
Presidential Decree 17 of 1967, control of Government-owned enterprises
is being gradually decentralized by conversion of PNP into PT which can
receive funds from GOI only in the form of equity or loan.
5.02      PT Supervisory Board powers, defined in detail in each PT Charter
of Incorporation, normally include authority to appoint and suspend members
of the Management Board, approve budgets and lay down general policy. Where
GOI is the only shareholder, the Minister of Finance appoints the members
of the Supervisory Board after consultation with, and on the recommendation
of, the Minister concerned. The conversion from PNP to PT is frequently
used to create larger units which, as independent companies, have to show
greater initiative and cost consciousness than PNP to be economically
viable.
B. Reorganization
5.03      GOI has agreed immediately to consolidate the PNP owning Sragi,
Pesantren and Gempolkrep into two PT and consolidate the remainder into two
other PT by mid-1975. The four would be further consolidated into two PT
within a reasonable period of time. The Supervisory Boards of the first two
(and preferably all four) would have three members in common: a chairman,
who would be a competent and experienced administrator, not necessarily
experienced in the sugar industry, but conversant with GOI wishes and with
access to the latest technical developments; a member with high caliber
experience in financial administration of commercial enterprises; and a
member experienced in the sugar industry. PT opening balance sheets, audited
in accordance with GOI regulations, would be transmitted promptly to IDA.
Operating Units
5.04      The PT would be responsible for the operational control of their
factories. Their Executive Management Boards would be slightly different
from the normal PNP/PT in composition in that there would be two Production
Directors instead of one; and instead of one Commercial Director, a Financial
Director would be responsible for financial and budgetary matters, and a
Comptroller Director for accounting and cost control. Day to day operation
would be the responsibility of the individual factories under their general
managers (see Annex 20 Appendix).



- 15 -
PT Joint Services
5.05      The PT would need to cooperate on a number of matters.  Most
important, for the project, is the orderly coordination of rehabilitation,
including the hiring and servicing of consultants and the organization of
procuren!2.nt.  The sugar PNP would, therefore, immediately enter into an
agreement (Joint Agreement) to form a Joint Sugar Projects Unit (the Unit),
under a Director who would organize: consultantts contracts, housing,
passages, transportation, and payments; bulking of items for procurement,
issuing invitations for and approving bids; exchange of technical information;
and other matters of jo.ant concern.  The sugar PT would assume PNP obligations
under the Joint Agreement as soon as they were formed. The Unit would be
located in Surabaya, which is nearest to most of the sugar factories.
5.06      The Unit would, on behalf of the PNP and successor PT, contract
with a consulting firm to provide engineering, including design engineering,
services and assist with planning and execution of the rehabilitation (see
para 4.12). These consultants would work to a program agreed by the Unit
and approved by IDA and would report to the Unit Director, for administrative
purposes, and to the PT First Directors for matters directly concerned with
rehabilitation of their factories. Draft terms of reference are in Annex
9 and suitable ass-:.'s were obtained at negotiations, including assurances
that, during the   -:Žct, PT would not undertake major capital works exceeding
US l M in an-,;    year, other than the project, without prior approval of IDA.
5.07      Common policy issues and coordination need to be considered on an
industry-wide basis. Examples are: long range planning, including coordina-
tion of major capital works inside and outside Java; industry legislation
and regulations; matters affecting the industry which are the concern of
other Government Departments e.g. irrigation and drainage; rents for sugar
lands; marketing and pricing policy, including import/export. At the time
of appraisal, a sugar corporation was proposed for this purpose, with the
PT as subsidiaries; but GOI now prefers a Standing Committee for Sugar (SCS),
to be established with a permanent secretariat in Jakarta. Detailed terms
of reference are being drafted, but the functions outlined in Annex 20
Appendix were agreed during negotiations. SCS composition would be: the
Director-General of Estates (chairman); a representative each of the Minis-
tries of Agriculture, Finance, Home Affairs, and Trade; representatives of
BAPPENAS, the Bank of Indonesia and BULOG.
5.08      During negotiations, draft charters for the sugar PT, the general
terms of the Joint Agreement and outline terms of reference for, and the
composition of SCS, were agreed with IDA, and assurances were obtained that:
(a) the sugar PNP would enter into the Joint Agreement; the sugar
PT would assume sugar PNP obligations under it as soon as
they were formed; and no material amendment would be made to



- 16 -
the charters, the Joint Agreement or the terms of reference
without prior approval of IDA;
(b) all appointments of, and changes in, the chairman and the
member responsible for financial matters of the Supervisory,
and all the members of the Executive Management, Boards of
PT controlling project factories would be subject to prior
consultation with IDA;
(c) no commitment for disbursement of IDA funds would be made
for any factory until it had been transferred to a PT, all
members of the PT Boards had been appointed, and that PT had
entered into tne Joint Agreement;
(d) a consulting firm, satisfactory to IDA, would be appointed
to provide engineering, including design engineering, services
for up to four years, on terms and conditions satisfactory
to IDA; and
(e) consultants, satisfactory to IDA, would be appointed, within
four months of PT incorporation, to provide management advice
to the PT, on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA; and
(f) SCS and its permanent secretariat would be established not
later than January 1, 1974.
It would be a condition of effectiveness that: PT owning Sragi, Pesantren and
Gempolkrep had been created in legal form; they had entered illto the Joint
Agreement; and a contract had been signed with consultants for Engineering
Services.
C. Accounts, Audit and Financial Control
5.09      Sugar PNP accounts are not up to date and, at the time of the
appraisal mission, 1971 accounts had not yet been audited. The Directorate-Ge
General of Audit is unde-.rmanned and lacks staff experienced in commercial
auditing. Audits are cionsequently too late to be of practical value and
commercial principles are not generally applied.
5.10      Retrieval of management information from the elaborate financial
records is laborious. Internal audit procedures are ineffective and cost
accounting virtually non-existent. Annual budgets follow BCU guidelines, but
executive staff aL factory level do nIot actively participate in budget form-
ulation. While capital costs are compared with budgets, management is not
generally cost conscious and budgetary control is not effective. It is
important, therefore, that management advisory consultants referred to in
para 4.12, acceptable to IDA, be appointed to each PT, starting with units
participatirig in the project.



- 17 -
5.11      Assurances were obtained at negotiations that assets transferred
to PT would be realistically valued within six months of incorporation,
in accordance with sound accounting principles, consistently applied.
5.12      PT responsible for project factories would keep accounts in com-
mercial form, showing the results of their activities and, separately, the
results of the project. The Pasuruan Research Station would keep separate
accounts of expenditures on project technical assistance and training for
research and the Ministry of Agriculture of expenditure on project feasibil-
ity studies. Accounts would be prepared annually for audit within three
months of the financial year end. Quarterly summary, and draft and audited
annual accounts would be submitted promptly to IDA, as would quarterly progress
reports in a form acceptable to IDA.
5.13      No commitment to disbursement of IDA funds for the Pasuruan Research
Station would be made until the services of research specialists had been
engaged. Independent auditors, acceptable to IDA, would be appointed for the
PT within three months of incorporation, and for the Research Station by the
end of the fiscal year.
5.14      Suitable assurances on the above matters were obtained at negotia-
tions, including assurances that: auditors would not be removed without
prior consultation with IDA; auditors would carry out comprehensive audits
following guidelines in Annex 21; copies of unaudited accounts would be
submitted to IDA within three months of the financial year end, and audited
accounts and audit reports as soon as they became available, but not later
than six months from the financial year end.
VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND FINANCIAL RESULTS
A. Production and Yields
6.01      Net incremental production of white sugar from the project would be
about 190,000 tons annually (15% of estimated total production) by 1978, due
to factory rehabilitation, increased area under sugarcane (17,000 ha) and
improved yield. Plant cane yield (tons cane/ha) is estimated to increase
from 105 to 120 at Gempolkrep and for the minor rehabilitation areas; 105 to
125 at Pesantren; and 115 to 130 at Sragi. Ratoon yields are estimated to
increase from 75/85 to 90/100; and farmers' cane from 65 to 75 (70 to 80 at
Sragi). Details are in Annex 5, Tables 1-3 and Annex 6 Table. Sugar factories,
not covered by the present project, would also increase their annual output
by an estimated 3% compounded over about five years, mainly due to improved
cultivation techniques, partly demonstrated by the project, though the benefit
from this increase is not attributed to the project in calculating rates of
return. Indonesia's total white sugar production is estimated to increase
to about 1.0 M tons by 1975 and to 1.3 M by 1980, based on present plans for
the industry.



- 18 -
B. Consumption, Marketing and Prices
6.02      Total sugar requirements, including industrial usage, are expected
to rise to about 1.2 M tons by 1975 and 1.6 M tons by 1980 (mainly from annual
population growth of 2.4% and income increases of about 5.0%). Imports would
make up the difference (Annex 4) until production could be increased further.
Marketing
6.03      Sugar marketing in Indonesia is characterized by inefficient distribu-
tion (Annex 4, paras 21 - 25) which has hindered supply, despite availability,
even during the processing season, resulting in artificially high prices and
other social frictions. Principal reasons are underestimation of demand,
uncertain monthly quotas and inability of the transport system to move sugar
quickly to meet local shortages. Unless the marketing system channels
production to consumers efficiently, benefits of increased output, such as
adequate supply and more stable consumer prices, are lost. GOI is continually
seeking to improve sugar marketing and, since appraisal, has moved sugar from
factory storage to buffer stocks at consumer centers. Assurances were obtainea
at negotiations that supply/dewand estimation would be irproved; imports
would be planned well ahead, matching supply to demand to t'-.e extent possible,
having regard to the objective of stable and economic prices and to priorities
for the use of foreign exchange; and, while it is still necessary to control
sugar distribution (as in other sugar importing countries), methods will be
determined by the agencies concerned with international marketing and dis-
tribution (e.g. BULOG), international trade (Ministry of Trade) and inter-
national planning (BAPPENAS), and not by one agency alone; and changes would
continue to be made to improve distribution efficiency and reduce speculation,
including suitable measures (such as penalties for failure to meet schedules)
to discourage abuses (such as hoarding). IDA would be informed of any
material changes in the marketing system.
Prices
6.04      Free international market prices of white sugar, marked by wide
fluctuations, have gradually recovered from their low 1965-69 level (about
US$100/ton, cif London in 1969). They rose sharply in 1972, due to a relapse
in Cuban production, coinciding with poor crops in the USSR. The long-term
forecast 1/ assumes that demand and supply would be about balanced by 1980;
but, due to the sharp rise in production and investment costs, average free
international prices (cif London) would move up to about US$180/ton. Actual
prices for any year will deviate from the trend, largely due to weather
variation, which causes sharp swings in supply, and particularly since demand
is inelastic in the short-term. Domestic ex-factory sugar prices (100 kg bag)
are expected to follow the international price trend and are forecast to be:
1972/74 Rp 6,450/bag; 1975/79 Rp 7,100; and 1980 onwards, Rp 7,400/bag. These
1/   Price Forecasts for Selected Primary Commodities in the 1970's (see M
72-174, April 1972); Sugar - A Reappraisal of Investment Policies for
Development Countries (See M 72-571, No. 1972); Economics Department,
IBRD.



- 19 _
prices are equivalent to US$155, 171 and 178 per ton. No significant change
is foreseen in the present ex-factory price of molasses of Rp 5,800/ton (US$14).
6.05      Since GOI controls sugar prices, and in view of their importance
to factories and farmers, assurances were obtained, at negotiations, that
GOI would set ex-factory sugar prices on the basis of commercial criteria,
and promptly inform IDA of prices set and how they are decided.
C. Forecast Financial Results
Production Units
6.06      Project investment in the factories would substantially improve
the return from past investment in existing installations (sunk costs). It
would, notably, enable the factories to operate for longer continuous periods,
as much as 50% longer in some cases. The return from the marginal project
investment would consequently be substantial.
6.07      Calculation of the financial rate of return (ROR(F)) is in Annex 22.
The assumptions are:
(a)  without the project, the factories would have continued modestly
to improve their output, at a rate of about 3% per year, until
about 1977;
(b)  an allowance should be made for a time lag due to possible
delays, by carrying forward 50% of incremental revenue to
the following year;
(c)  forecast price changes apply equally to production with and
without the project; and
(d)  expatriate emoluments would be liable to tax from 1974, charged
as an expense.
6.08      On the above assumptions, the estimated overall financial rate of
return, before tax, would be 23%; ISS indicated that this would be in line
with the return expected by international investors. The effects of possible
increases in cost and decreases in revenue are illustrated below:
ROR(F)   %% Revenue   % Cost Increase
Decrease    NIL    5       10
10       17   14      12
5       20   17      15
NIL       23   20      18
6.09      A reduction of factory operating time to 160 days (from 180/170)
would reduce before tax ROR(F) to about 17%; 140 days, to about 13%.



- 20 -
Farmers' Income
6.10      By 1978, an estimated 30,000 additional farmers would rent land to
project factories and about 5,000 would switch to sugarcane from other crops.
Though rent is about equal in value to net income from alternative crops,
discounted at the opportunity cost of capital to farmers (not less than 25%7
per year), rent avoids cultivation risks, such as weather, pests and diseases,
and many farmers renting land would obtain seasonal employment in sugarcane
fields, or elsewhere, thus further increasing their income. New cane farmers
(ratooning only) would increase their incomes by 40% (by about Rp 25,000
(US$60) each), compared with other crops generally cultivated; and farmers
already growing cane (about 4,000) would increase their annual income by about
50% (Rp 60,000 to Rp 90,000) because of higher yields through project extension
services (Annex 23, para 10). However, cane farming is risky, especially
for farmers not used to it, and there are organizational problems that cannot
be quickly solved (para 2.07).
VII. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Economic Impact
7.01      The project would enable Indonesia to use its comparative advantage
as a low cost producer of sugar, arising from a favorable climate, high soil
fertility and low labor cost, by making a threefold impact on the economy:
improving production and the balance of payments; providing additional rural
income and contributing to stabilization of domestic sugar prices.
7.02      The project would reduce Indonesia's annual sugar imports by about
190,000 tons at full production, and increase molasses exports by about
60,000 tons. By importing rice, instead of sugar, Indonesia would save
about an annual Rp 100,000/ha (US$240) (Annex 23, Table 2), based on average
1971/72 prices. Using projected 1980 import prices for sugar (rice prices
unchanged) the saving would increase to about Rp 164,000/ha. The net benefit
to the balance of payments, after deducting the cost of rice imports to
replace production lost from project farms, would be about an annual Rp 17,000
M (US$41 M) at full development in 1978, at prices forecast for that year
(Annex 23).
7.03      Sugarcane farming is about as labor-intensive as the displaced
rice production, but men are used more for sugarcane, women more for rice,
and peak seasons are somewhat different. While net field labor employment
would not change numerically, therefore, its composition would. The project
would create an additional 200 permanent and 80,000 seasonal wage paying
jobs in the sugar industry.
7.04      Improved production and distribution, under the project, would tend
to prevent the present occasionally artificially high consumer prices of
sugar and to stabilize the market. This would help reduce the social tensions
referred to in para 6.03.      -



- 21 -
~~  ~/
B.  Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity
7.05      For rate of return purposes, all factors of production, including
la b      e been valued at existing market rates, since these represent the
Econom   opportunity cost in the project area.  Investment costs (including
gnencies) are as given in par& 4.15 (except that management advisory ser-
vices are apportioned between project and other factories, and 30% of research
costs and none of the feasibility study costs are attributed to project pro-
duction). Economic benefits comprise estimated incremental production valued
at forecast average free world market sugar prices (cif Indonesia), less the
amounts by which the forecast cif cost of additional rice imports exceeds
domestic production costs. Based on these assumptions, the estimated rate
of return to the economy (ROR(E)) would be 26%.
7.06      Sensitivity of ROR(E) to sugar prices has been tested and increase/
decrease of 10% in ex-factory sugar prices would change ROR(E) by about 6
points. Sensitivity to labor costs indicates that doubling wage rates, with-
out increasing labor productivity, would reduce ROR(E) from 26% to 18%. Other
sensitivity tests, referred to in Annex 23, have been carried out. These
returns and the impact on the economy confirm the high priority for the
project and its place in Government's strategy for agricultural development.
VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations, the following principal assurances were
obtained:
(a) before any rehabilitation is planned, a survey, with terms
of reference satisfactory to IDA, would be carried out to
determine that sufficient land would be available for cane
production; and IDA would be informed of the amount, and
the method of determining, annual rent (4.05);
(b) consultants acceptable to IDA would be appointed, with terms
of reference and upon terms and conditions acceptable to IDA:
to carry out feasibility studies and prepare a program for
additional sugar production in Indonesia (4.13); and to
provide: appraisal assistance to BBD (4.20); management
advice to the PT (5.08); Engineering Services to the PT
for up to four years (5.08); and research services to
the Pasuruan Research Station;
(c) all rehabilitation plans (4.06) and minor rehabilitation
sub-project appraisals, would be subject to review by
IDA before any commitment to rehabilitation (4.20);
(d) the sugar PNP would enter into the Joint Agreement, the
obligations of which would be assumed by the sugar PT



- 22 -
and no material amendment would be made to the charters
for the PT, the Joint Agreement, or terms of reference
for SCS, without prior IDA approval; all appointments
of, and changes in, the appointments of the chairman
and the member responsible for financial matters of the
Supervisory, and all the members of the Executive Management,
Boards of PT, controlling project factories, would be subject
to prior consultation with IDA; and SCS and its permanent
secretariat would be established not later than January 1,
1974 (5.08); and
(f) sugar supply/demand estimated would be improved and imports
planned well ahead to match supply with demand at stable
and economic prices; and IDA would be informed of any material
changes in the sugar marketing system (6.03).
8.02      It would be a condition of effectiveness that PT owning Sragi,
Pesantren and Gempolkrep had been created in legal form; they had entered
into the Joint Agreement; and a contract had been entered into with con-
sultants for engineering services (5.08).
8.03      It would be a condition precedent to commitment to IDA financing:
(a) of the feasibility studies, that consultants acceptable to
IDA had been appointed with terms of reference and upon terms
and conditions acceptable to IDA (4.13); and
(b) of any factory rehabilitation, that the factory concerned had
been transferred to a PT; all members of the PT Boards had
been appointed; it had entered into the Joint Agreement
(5.08); and
(c) of the Research Station that research consultants, acceptable
to IDA, had been appointed (5.13).

SUGAR PROJECT
IDA Credits to Indonesian Agriculture
A. Credits to the Estate Industry
1.        Four IDA credits for rehabilitation and development of rubber
oilpalm, tea and other crops in the Government-owned estate sector have
been approved to date. The first (Credit 155) in June 1969 was for US$16.0 IT
to assist two estate enterprises (PNP V and PNP VII) in North Sumatra. The
second (194) in June 1970 for US$17 M was for PNP IV and PNP VI, also in
North Sumatra. The third (259) in June 1971 for US$15 M was for PNP XII and
PNP XIII in West Java; and the fourth (319) in June 1972 for US$11 M was for
PNP X in South Sumatra. Further details of these Credits (dates of signing
in parenthesis) are in the following paragraphs.
Credits 155 and 194 - Rubber and Oilpalm (Estates I and II), US$16 M and
US$17 M
(June 20, 1969; June 15, 1970)
2.        Credits 155 and 194 were for projects to rehabilitate four
Government-owned estate groups. Their problems are identical. They involve
the planting or replanting of nearly 40,000 ha of oilpalms and rubber;
upkeep of some 29,000 ha of immature trees; fertilizers; agricultural
vehicles and machinery; processing plant; and technical assistance for
research and management.
3.        The projects are about one year behind schedule due to initial
delays in the appointment of management advisors and visiting inspectors,
lack of suitable planting material in the early stages of development,
and an unexpected sharp fall in rubber prices which seriously restricted the
availability of self-generated funds. Adequate supplies of good quality
planting material are now becoming available so that by the end of 1974 oil
palm planting programs should be on target. There has also been a recovery
in rubber prices in recent months, and the availability of self-generated
funds will be much less of a problem in 1973.
4.        While there have been improvements in plantation work, leading to
increased production, weak and inexperienced management continues to be the
principal problem and the impact of advisors has been mixed. Improvements
are also needed in budgetary procedures, financial and operational control, and
overall organization in the estates sector.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
5.        Government has taken two steps to improve the situation.  First,
in November 1971, it agreed to an IDA-prepared Aide-Memoire on PNP Management
Problems, including an action timetable for implementation of specific
improvements. Project PNP's were to execute the action program by July 1972.
As a result, reporting and accounting procedures have been improved, but
management control is still deficient. Second, it commissioned a study by
management consultants 1/ to determine a system for effective supervision
and control of Government-owned estates.  The report is concluded, and a
timetable to implement the recommendations is being drawn up. The same
consultants have been retained to implement their recommendations on
management information systems. Their work is scheduled to begin mid-June
1973.
Credit 259 - Tea (Estates III), US$15 M
(June 30, 1971)
6.        Credit 259 was for the rehabilitation of two groups of Government-
owned tea estates in West Java. The project includes rehabilitation of
2,100 ha of existing tea, planting of 2,300 ha of new tea and 1,100 ha of
cinchona (quinine) and reorganization and re-equipment of the estatest tea
factories. Technical assistance has been provided to strengthen management
and introduce up-to-date tea cultivation and processing methods. Tea
research is being improved. Progress to date is satisfactory and relationship
between management and consultants are good. The project provided for a
study of the depressed and inefficient smallholder and private estate tea
industries, aimed at finding ways to rehabilitate them. The resultant
project has been appraised and an IDA Credit for US$7.8 M is scheduled for
presentation to the IDA Board on June 12, 1973.
Credit 319 - Rubber and Oilpalm and Crop Diversification (Estates IV),
US$11.0 M
(June 28, 1972)
7.        Credit 319 was for rehabilitation and development of 8,600 ha
rubber and 9,400 ha oilpalms, including factories, of a group of Government-
owned estates in South Sumatra. It also provides for rehabilitation and
expansion of storage and pumping facilities at the port of Pandjung. After
a delay of several months to allow additional time to appoint inspection
services and executive assistants, this Credit became effective on February 1,
1973.
B. Irrigation Credits
Credit 127 - First Irrigation Rehabilitation Project, US$5 M
(September 6, 1968)
8.        Credit 127 was for the purchase of earth moving equipment required
for rehabilitating three irrigation systems in Java and for the construction
1/   SyCip, Gorres, Velayo & Co; financed from IDA Credit 216.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
of a fourth on South Sumatra. While 'all equipment supplied under the project
is being well utilized and disbursements are 98% of appraisal timetable, the
actual cost of the rehabilitation will be considerably higher than was
estimated during appraisal, as a result of the unforeseen need to include
substantial drainage works under the project. This increase in project costs
is being met by Government. Project completion will be delayed by about
two years, but the economic rate of return will still be above 20%.
Credit 195 - Second Irrigation Rehabilitation Project, US$18.5 M
(June 15, 1970)
9.        Credit 195 was for the rehabilitation of the Jatiluhur project in
West Java covering 186,000 ha. An autonomous agency, Otorita Jatiluhur,
was established to administer the project. After a slow start due to
problems with preparation of tender documents and difficulty in obtaining
acceptable bids, work is now proceeding and the project could still be
completed on schedule, provided good contractors win the last two contracts.
There are no serious cost over-runs, but due to the above difficulties,
disbursements are presently behind schedule.
Credit 220 - Third Irrigation Rehabilitation Project, US$14.5 M
(November 6, 1970)
10.       Credit 220 was for rehabilitation of three irrigation systems
covering 200,000 ha, two in Java and one in S. Sulawesi. Construction is
presently behind schedule due to initial difficulties in recruiting expatriate
staff, problems with the preparation of contract documents, over-extension of
local contractors due to the large volume of construction involved. Though
some improvement in project execution is expected, it is still estimated
that the project's completion date will be two to three years behind
appraisal report estimate. Overall project cost estimates have increased by
15% and Government has made arrangements to meet this cost over-run. Despite
the cost increase and the delay in implementation, the economic rate of
return is expected to be satisfactory.
Credit 289 - Fourth Irrigation Rehabilitation Project, US$12.5 M
(March 9, 1970)
11.       Credit 289 was for rehabilitation and improvement of irrigation at
Pekalen-Sampean covering 229,000 ha; investigation of groundwater resources
in East Java; and feasibility studies of two future irrigation projects
in Java. Consultants have been appointed and the first civil works are now
being let.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
C. Other Agricultural Credits
Credit 211 - Fisheries ProJect, US$3.5 M
(July 13, 1970)
12.       Credit 211 was for part of an overall program to develop export-
oriented skipjack tuna fishing. It consists of construction and equipment
of freezing and cold storage facilities, the construction of a wharf in Aer
Tembaga, the purchase of 30 wooden vessels, for pole and line fishing, and
two refrigerated carriers to transport frozen tuna to export markets. The
project provides technical assistance to support the program. Though
operations of the project unit, the State Fisheries Enterprise, have been
inefficient, the recent appointment by Government of new management, accept-
able to IDA, is expected to improve the situation, and overall prospects for
successful implementation have improved, particularly since there is an
upward trend of world market prices for skipjack tuna.
Credit 246 - Seeds Project, US$7.5 M
(May 14, 1971)
13.       Credit 246 was for establishment of facilities to grow, process
and distribute high-yielding varieties of rice and other seeds. It is behind
schedule due to delays in organizing management and effective procurement.
A March 1973 supervision mission reported these constraints are being
overcome, but due to the delays and recent exchange rate adjustments, project
costs are likely to be considerably in excess of appraisal report estimates.
The project is in process of reevaluation.
Credit 355 - Beef Cattle Development, US$3.6 M
(January 31, 1973)
14.       Credit 355 was for development of beef cattle production in the
outer islands. It is not yet effective, awaiting the completion of land
leasing arrangements.
Credit 358 - North Sumatra Smallholder Development, US$5.0 M
(February 14, 1973)
15.       Credit 358 was for the development of smallholder rubber production
in North Sumatra. It is scheduled to become effective in July, 1973.
May 12, 1973

SUGAR PROJECT
Sugarcane Culture and Sugarcane Growing in Java
A. Sugarcane Culture
1.        Sugar cane is a stout, tall perennial grass.  It is a tolerant
crop that grows under many tropical and subtropical conditions of soil,
moisture and fertility. It responds well to high sunlight and temperature,
adequate moisture (rainfall or irrigation), good drainage and proper
nutrition.
2.        Different cane varieties have characteristics suitable for
different conditions, e.g. drought and disease resistance, flood tolerance.
The variety to be planted should, therefore, be selected on the basis of
field experiments for the particular conditions in which it will grow.
Tillage should be to a depth of about 6-8 cm and soil should be thoroughly
broken up to allow good root development. Cane "seed" comes from stalks
or tops of mature cane and should be disease free. It is planted in furrows
and covered, and must have moisture in the soil soon after planting for good
germination. From soil tests and/or field experiments and experience,
appropriate and adequate fertilizer should be applied. Phosphate and some
nitrogen are commonly needed and are usually applied with the seed, or
later with additional nitrogen applications. Unless there is adequate
rainfall, the cane must be irrigated every two to four weeks, depending on
the amount of evapo-transpiration. Until the canopy of cane foliage has
shaded the inter-rows, weeding must be done three or four times, either
manually, mechanically or with herbicides. Pests, such as stem or top
borers, other insects and rats, frequently infest cane fields and must be
controlled. Some of the more common cane diseases can only be prevented
from spreading by physical removal of diseased plants, especially important
in the nursery.
3.        As cane approaches maturity, usually in 12-24 months, absence of
moisture is important for ripening and sugar contetTr-nd there must be a
relatively dry season for optimum results. Irrigation intervals must be
lengthened and water withdrawn for several weeks before harvest. Some type
of pre-harvest sampling of the fields is advisable to determine maturity
by the amount and quality of sucrose (sugar content) in the juice so that
fields are selected for harvest in the proper sequence.
4.        The entire cane stalk contains extractable sugar and cane is
usually harvested, by hand or some mechanical means, by cutting it at ground
level and taking off the top part of the stalk, all the leaves and the dry

trash, and stripping it with a heavy knife (cutlass, machete) or by
burning. Cane is loaded onto railcars or trucks by hand or machine and
transported to the factory. In most areas the plant crops are "ratooned"
by allowing new shoots to gro' f_ro-m -cant  it        ftr- e

howev#er, cane is usually pulled or dug out of the groa dttt    the land
is needed for another crop the following season, and no ratooning is then
possible.
5.        When cane arrives at the factory it is crushed and milled between
rollers to squeeze out the juice. Cane from burnt fields deteriorates
rapidly and should be milled within hours. Cane stripped by hand deteriorates
less rapidly but should, nevertheless, be milled as soon as possible.
Burning is not practised in Java, where labor is cheap. Hand-cut cane can
be processed immediately but mechanically harvested cane must go through
some kind of cleaning or washing plant for the removal of foreign matter
before being sent to the mills.
B. Sugarcane_Growing in Java
Background
6.        The sugar industry in Java, which 40 years ago produced as much
as 3 million tons of sugar per annum and was one of the world's major
exporters, had already been curtailed before World War II because of the
Depression and world overproduction. Its operations were then severely
interrupted by the Japanese invasion and by the postwar struggle for
Independence. Production revived after the War, but never again approached
the prewar peak. In recent years, the output of factory-produced sugar has
been something over 700,000 tons per annum; however, since 1966 the growth
of consumption has overtaken domestic production and, instead of a surplus
for export, imports of about 100,000 tons per annum have been needed to meet
domestic demand. In addition to white sugar produced by the factories,
there is a substantial production of crude, brown sugar (jaggery) made by
simpler methods from smallholders' cane or from palms, estimated to amount
to at least 350,000 tons per annum.
7.        Much of Java is very well suited for sugar production.  It has
large areas of very fertile volcanic soils, many of them low-lying, flat
and alluvial. The climate, except in the west, is also favorable, with a
wet season from November to April giving a supply of moisture which is
ample to produce large tonnages of cane, and a well-marked dry season to
ensure ripening and harvesting. Sugar production, although substantial,
is only a small part of total agricultural activity in Indonesia, and in
1970 occupied about 135,000 ha out of a total cultivated area in Java of
about 8 M ha and in Indonesia as a whole of over 50 M ha.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
Organization
8.        Today, of 55 factories, 48 belong to Government and 7 to so-called
private companies, though 5 are actually owned by a Government agency. The
48 Government factories are under the control of the Directorate of Estates
in Jakarta (BCU) which is also responsible for Government estates growing
many other crops, notably oil palm and rubber. BCU estates are grouped
into four geographical areas, each of which is the responsibility of BCU
Area Representatives. Area I covers North and Central Sumatra and Areas II,
III, and IV cover West, Central and East Java respectively. Within each
BCU Area, the various enterprises are grouped under PNP, about five to
seven under each. There are eight PNP concerned with sugar (one in West
Java, two in Central Java and five in East Java).
9.        Operational control centers on the PNP.  They represent the highest
level in the industry at which there is an organization concerned solely
with sugar; they are responsible for recommending managerial appointments in
the factories to the Director-General of Estates, and for the appointment
of senior factory staff; and they control the financial policies of the
factories, any surpluses on operation usually being retained by the PNP
generating them. A large part of PNP revenue is absorbed by taxes and
other central charges, or in meeting capital charges on accumulated indebted-
ness. There is little lateral transfer of remaining funds, e.g. to finance
new development. Control over expenditure rests with the PNP officials
(subject to the overriding authority of the BCU).
10.       BCU, at Jakarta EQ and in the Areas, is organized more or less
functionally, i.e. with specific officials responsible for finance, personnel
and marketing; but there are no BCU officials concerned solely with the
sugar industry, either in the area covered by an individual BCU (with the
exception of one senior technologist in East Java) or in the country as
a whole. There is also a strong functional emphasis in the managerial
organization at estate and factory level, but there is not always a clear
enough allocation of general managerial responsibility to the administrators
(managers) of particular sugar production units, nor is there usually a
single person responsible for the total factory operation.
General Characteristics
11.       The sugar industry in Java has characteristics which sharply
differentiate it from cane sugar industries in other countries. Elsewhere,
cane is grown continuously on the same land for years without interruption,
either on estates of substantial size, belonging to and cultivated by the
enterprise owning the factory; or on smaller privately owned plots selling
cane for processing to a central factory. In many cases sugar estates have
been developed on land not previously under systematic cultivation.
12.       In Java, when sugar production began more than 80 years ago, the
most suitable lands were already occupied and intensely cultivated, above
all with rice; and sugar estates, of the kind developed elsewhere, could have
been established only at the cost of very serious social disturbance and,



ANNEX 2
Page 4
at least locally, serious reduction of food supplies. A system was evolved,
therefore, by which land- could be made available for cane cultivation
without passing out of the ownership of the local community and without
being permanently withdrawn from rice production. Under this system, the
land is leased for one season at a time to a sugar enterprise and then
reverts to the lessors (peasant occupiers of small plots) for two seasons,
during which it is usually planted to rice (with perhaps some intermediate
crops during the dry part of the year). In effect, each factory has
allocated to it an area of land, its concession area, within which it is
entitled to arrange leases on this rotation system. Ideally, arrangements
are worked out with representatives of the village or villages involved
by which one-third of the land is scheduled for leasing in each of three
successive years. In practice, since sugar cane takes more than 12 months
to mature fully, and some time must be allowed for soil preparation and for
clearing after harvest, the nominal lease period is 16 months. In recent
times, the actual period has often been shorter because of late release of
land by the farmers. In fact, the amount leased usually falls somewhat
short of the theoretical one-third, though most factories have been able to
maintain the area under cane at a more or less steady level year by year.
Rentals are regulated by Government order and must, under the more democratic
system now prevailing, be sufficiently attractive to induce farmers to
release land (i.e. related to the opportunity cost of land).
13.       This rotational system results in important differences of agri-
cultural practice. Elsewhere it is normal to ratoon cane for periods of
five years (or longer). This is not customary in Java, though occasionally
the cane root is left for the farmer himself to take a ratoon crop if he
chooses, after the land has reverted to him. It is therefore normally
necessary to plant cane afresh each year. This involves additional planting
costs for labor and planting material from nurseries, which occupy about
12% of the available land (which could otherwise be used to grow production).
14.       Another important effect of the rotational system is that, since
the lands cultivated with sugar cane are scattered over an area at least
three times that actually planted at any one time, the cane transport
system (normally light railway) has to be proportionately more extensive
than would be needed for a more compact layout, with consequent increases
also in rolling stock requirements and fuel costs. Irrigation and drainage
systems cannot be designed and operated with sugar cane needs primarily
in mind, but are oriented towards rice, wlhich occupies most of the land
most of the time. There are additional administrative tasks and problems.
The negotiation of leases every year is time consuming and a significant
burden on management; supervision of the growing cane takes longer and
protection against theft of mature cane is more difficult. Although the
lands leased for sugar are not as scattered as the multitude of individual
landholdings involved would suggest, the grouping which takes place, by
agreement with the local community, still leaves the factory with a number
of comparatively small and separated areas of cane. This complicates
agricultural management and makes the introduction of alternative cultivation
techniques difficult. Finally, additional costs are involved after harvesting
in removing the cane roots, restoring boundaries and otherwise preparing
the land for reversion to rice.



ANNEX 2
Page 5
Irrigation and Drainage
15.       Irrigation water comes mainly from rivers through storage dams,
barrages and direct or pumped intake, though there are some shallow and
deep wells. Except for water from wells, most of the primary irrigation
supplies are the responsibility of the Government irrigation service.
Originally of good design and construction, the irrigation systems have
deteriorated for various reasons and are now being rehabilitated (largely
with IDA assistance).
The Reynoso System
16.       Water is the responsibility of the sugar factory field staff as
soon as it reaches the cane field boundaries. Inside the fields, water is
distributed along drainage channels peculiar to the Reynoso system of sugar
cane culture (developed by Sr Reynoso of Cuba) which, with modifications, is
in general use in Java. In this system, ring drains around the field are
dug manually to a depth of 70-80 cm, main drains are then dug at 50-100 m
intervals and 60-80 cm deep across the field connected to the ring drains.
Cross drains, at a spacing of 4-12 m and 40-70 cm depth, connect to the
main drains, leaving a bed 50-100 by 4-12 m in which cane is planted in
furrows 15-35 cm apart. After planting, furrows are gradually filled with
soil to ground level by a series of earthing up operations, each preceded
by an application of irrigation water baled by bucket from the cross drain
into the furrow. Weeding is carried out, with one or two more earthings,
and a final hilling up completes the formation of the ridges. The principal
objects of this system are deep tillage, deep planting, irrigation and
drainage. It is very labor-intensive but can be continued so long as there
is an ample supply of low-paid labor, as at present. Yields of sugar per
hectare under this system, although lower than prewar, are still good by
international standards; but the very favorable soil and climatic conditions
should enable appreciably higher yields to be obtained at lower cost,
particularly if planting material is improved, fertilizer practices intensi-
fied, and drainage restored.
17.       The drainage systems in the sugar areas of Java have been designed
as a compromise between the requirements of sugar cane for free drainage
and the requirements of rice for removal of seasonal excess water. To
drain land to sugar cane standards would prejudice the rice padi system,
especially during the dry season, and a compromise becomes inevitable. The
system is minimal for sugarcane and can result in flooding or excessively
high water tables which seriously restrict root volume and cane growth.
Proper maintenance of irrigation and drainage channels, however, helps to
minimize the disadvantages inherent in the system.
Farmers' Cane
18.       The proportion of Indonesia's white sugar produced from cane
supplied by farmers themselves has risen from 6.3% in 1967 to 9.4% in 1971.
With their lower yields, farmers produced this 9.4% of sugar from 15.7% of



ANNEX 2
Page 6
the total area under cane. Farmers' cane is almost invariably ratoon, and
often has little irrigation, high levels of pests and disease, incorrect
cultivation and fertilizer practices, and poorly supervised and coordinated
harvesting. Farmers' production for factories is probably less than 25%
of their total cane, the remainder being used to produce crude brown sugar.
19.       The "private" Krebet Baru factory in South Malang is entirely
dependent on farmers' cane and farmers provide a significant proportion of
the total supply in PNP XXI. At Krebet Baru, farmers are organized into
a "cooperative" and in PNP XXI most of the farmers sell their cane to
contractors or middlemen who also grow cane on land they own or lease. The
most serious constraint confronting farmers is finance, for they do not
have the funds to live without income during the nine months or so it takes
the cane to mature. Until recently, factories processed farmers' cane in
return for half the sugar made from it, but in practice most of the farmers
sold their rights to sugar at a discount, long before the cane was harvested.
New Areas
20.       In 1960 a decision was made to grow cane at Tjot Girek in North
Sumatra and a factory was built there. In 1970 a trial run was made on cane
from 223 ha. The cane was over-age, difficulties were experienced in
delivery to the factory, the output of cane cutters was low and juice
purities were poor. The cane was abandoned, but new sugar cane trials are
now being conducted in the area with technical assistance from the British
Government. At Bone, in South West Sulawesi, the major part of equipment
for a factory is on site and, since 1963, attempts have been made to grow
cane there. Response to phosphate and potash trials has shown cane can
be grown. Other areas in both Sumatra and Sulawesi and on other islands
have been surveyed for possible sugar development and trials are under way
at some of the sites chosen for study.
Conclusions
21.       Conclusions are:
(a) sugar grows well in Java, as do many other crops (notably
rice); sugar lands are owned by many peasant farmers in
small lots (less than 0.5 ha), who appear keen to rent land
to sugar factories, provided rents reflect opportunity
cost; though the extent of their interest is hard to
measure;
(b) leases should be extended to include at least one ratoon
crop, cultivated and harvested by the factories or the
farmers themselves;



ANNEX 2
Page 7
(c) appreciably higher yields are possible, if better
planting material is provided and known cultivation
techniques are more widely applied; technical assis-
tance for research to provide the material and for
field practices to apply modern techniques would
greatly help to achieve higher yields; and
(d) cane farming is not common--partly because special
permission is required for cane farming on factory
concession land, partly because the factories do not
have the capacity to accommodate additional cane
production, but also partly because cane farmers need
credit to span the long pre-harvest period; cane farming
could be increased if: regulations permitted it,
technical advice was given by the factories, and credit
provided (by the Bank Rakyat, which is willing to con-
sider it).

SUGAR PROJECT
Cane Sugar Processing
A. General
1.        Sugar extraction from cane is basically a simple process.  Cane
stalks are crushed between four or five groups of heavy rollers. The
sugar-rich juice is squeezed out as cane passes between the rollers. Water
is added at the last mill to increase extraction efficiency.
2.        The extracted juice is weighed and sampled before clarification
and decolorization, then treated with milk of lime (CaO) and either sulfur
dioxide (S02) or carbon dioxide (C02) or a combination of these chemicals,
to remove non-sugars and to decolorize the juice and produce a direct
consumption, plantation white sugar. The treated juice is heated and settled
in tanks or clarifiers. The clear juice overflow from the settling tanks
is passed on to evaporators for further processing. The muddy remainder is
pumped to filter presses or rotary vacuum filters to recover its sugar
content and the filter mud discarded after its sugar content is exhausted.
3.        Evaporators concentrate the thin clear juice into a thick syrup
from which sugar is crystallized by boiling at supersaturation in vacuum
pans. The low boiling temperatures produced under vacuum prevent burning
or conversion to caramel.
4.        Crystallization is carried out in several stages and the
particular boiling system used generally depends on the quality of the
materials handled and, to some extent, on the equipment available. The trend
has been to simplify and reduce the number of boilings and at the same time
increase the sugar recovery efficiency of each boiling stage. Many
factories now use the three boiling system, while some still use four
boiling. In general, the first and second boilings are of higher quality
and produce sugar in saleable form. The third and fourth boilings produce
lower quality sugar which must be reprocessed into saleable form.
5.        The product of crystallization in the vacuum pans is known as
massecuite, a mixture of sugar crystals in molasses. The sugar crystals
are separated from the molasses by centrifuging. The molasses from the
early boilings are still not completely exhausted of sugar and are recycled
for reprocessing. The saleable sugar is weighed and bagged for storage
and distribution.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
6.        To maximize sugar recovery from the lowest quality boilings, the
massecuite is treated in crystallizers after boiling. The supersaturation
necessary to continue crystallization is provided by cooling the massecuite.
Low quality sugar is separated by centrifuging and melted for reprocessing.
The exhausted molasses recovered by centrifuging are generally sold to
produce alcohol or for use as cattle feed.
7.        The residual fiber, known as bagasse, is burnt as fuel for steam
raising in the factory and can also be used as fuel for steam locomotives
on light railways used to transport cane from the fields. It is still so
used in Indonesia although steam locomotives are being replaced by diesel
units. Modern factories with these units have surplus bagasse, which can
be used to make paper and other similar products, or converted to cattle
feed.
8.        A sugar factory consequently has the following "stations":  cane
handling and storage; power generation; milling; juice processing; crystal-
lization; baggage and storage. Crushing needs massive machinery and sugar
factories deal with material in large bulk. They are, therefore, expensive
to build (US$25-30 million) though robust in construction and long lasting
(those in Java being 50 years old or more, with some original machinery
still running).
B. Sugar Processing in Java
Cane Transport, Handling and Storage
9.        In Java, sugarcane is usually delivered to the factories on
narrow-gauge railcars of 4-6 ton capacity. Light steam locomotives, which
still haul most of the cane, are no longer made and are being replaced by
diesel units. Agricultural tractors or oxen are also used for supplemental
haulage. Road transport of cane is limited, though in a few areas it may
carry about 50% of a factory's cane supply. Since Java factories are not
equipped to receive cane directly from road trucks, loads are transferred
manually to railcars for weighing and delivery.
10.       Because of the extensive crop rotation system, light railways in
the Indonesian sugar industry are much longer per unit of cane delivered
than for similar sized factories in other countries. There are about five
different track gages, ranging from 60 cm to 75 cm, which makes it difficult
to link adjoining systems. However, in the flat, densely populated areas
of Java, rail systems have the advantage of occupying only about half the
area needed for an alternative road system.
11.       After weighing, cane is stored in the millyard in waiting railcars.
Unloading is usually by winch or crane. Cane is hoisted onto a feeder
table, usually static, though some mechanized rotating tables have been
installed. It is then raked into the main cane carrier. In a few factories,
cane is unloaded manually into the main cane carrier.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
12.       Generally, the installations and operation of cane handling
and storage are inefficient, though adequate for current production rates.
If these rates are to be increased, however, improved equipment and methods
will be necessary to maintain reliable and steady cane feed to the mills.
Milling Plant
13.       Milling is the only method used in Java to extract juice from
sugar cane. Cane or bagasse diffusion has not yet been introduced. Most
factories are equipped with a 2-roll crusher and four 3-roll mills, driven
by steam engines, though a few are electrically powered. Most factories also
have cane knives and shredders. Mill sizes range from 60 to 84 in.
14.       Mills operate at slower speeds than those of most other sugar
industries, which are generally powered by larger drive units and operate
at much greater speeds for higher production rates. Because of their age,
detailed inspection of individual mills will be necessary in the Java
industry to verify their condition before repowering. Cracked mill housings
and bedplates are reported in a few factories.
15.       Top roll hydraulics are installed in about 85% of the factories;
the remainder have fixed top rolls. The hydraulics are usually of old-
fashioned deadweight design. Most of the mill bearings are white metal,
adequate for present conditions; but bronze bearings will be needed to
handle higher speeds and increased mill loading. Many mills have inter-
mediate carriers not fitted for satisfactory application of imbibition
water, and the quantity of water is inadequate for maximum extraction.
S team and Power Generation
16.       Many boilers are of the "elephant" firetube design, installed in
the 1920's. They have from 250 m2 to 350 m2 of heating surface and are
rated at 3.5-6.5 tons steam per hour. Working pressures are usually
7-8 kg/cm2 but a few produce steam at 2-4 kg/cm2. Since 1963, about 27
more modern bagasse boilers have been installed with ratings from 12.0-37.5
tons steam per hour and working pressures from 8.0-18.5 kg/cm2. These have
generally been supplied as a package, including auxiliaries, water treatment
plant and turbogenerator.
17.       The older boilers are manually fed with bagasse through an
opening in the arch of the step-gate furnace, which requires much labor
and results in loss of efficiency because excess air is drawn through
the feed door. They are not adequately fitted with instruments and gages,
and firing control depends on the operator's skill and experience. Some
factories claim a shortage of bagasse and burn supplementary fuel, either
fuel-oil or wood. Boiler inefficiencies and the use of baled bagasse as
steam locomotive fuel, contribute to this shortage. Factory steam has not
always been installed with thermal economy in mind.
18.       Supplemental fuel-oil is used continuously in some of the new
boiler installations, because bagasse feed is unreliable. There are no



ANNEX 3
Page 4
adequate bagasse storage facilities and bagasse reclaim systems are ineffi-
cient. Bagasse handling systems do not react fast enough to switch bagasse
feed from storage during mill stops or slowdowns, and oil-fired boiler
operators manually adjust fuel-oil flow to maintain boiler steam.
19.       Cold water is often used as boiler feed because of sugar contamina-
tion in warm factory condensates, quite common with old processing equip-
ment. This use of cold make-up water could be minimized by individual
sampling and testing of condensate before the common collection points.
Some new boiler installations are equipped with flame photometers which
continuously monitor factory condensates to the boiler. Water treatment
plants, furnished with new boilers, are of generous size at 50% of boiler
capacity.
20.       In general, boiler stations cause very little factory lost time
and, though old, perform quite reliably for existing operating conditions.
There are few problems with maintenance, since this is generally confined
to tube replacement and brickwork repair.
21.       Power is generated by steam turbines, steam engines and diesel
generators. At three factories, supplemental hydro-electric power is
available. Diesel generators are generally used during out-of-crop periods,
though a few factories operate solely on diesel power. New turbogenerators
are usually installed with new boilers.
22.       Power is generally supplied at 220 V or 380 V, 50 hertz.  Factory
loads are grouped and usually handled by individual generators to eliminate
the need for paralleling machines.
23.       In any improvement program, the addition of greater generating
capacity will most likely involve replacement of switchgear installed for
systems with low current rating.
Juice Processing
24.       Three main juice treatment processes are used:  sulfitation, car-
bonation and defecation. Juice sulfitation and carbonation are Javanese
Aevelopments of the 1920's and not generally used elsewhere. The juices
,re treated with milk of lime, sulfur dioxide or carbon dioxide, either
alone or in combination, and in several steps which may include heating in
stages to decolorize and remove non-sugar impurities. Sulfitation and
carbonation are used to produce SHS quality sugars and defecation to produce
lower HS quality sugars.
25.       After chemical treatment, the juice is passed to batch setting
tanks. Few factories have clarifiers. The clear juice overflow passes to
evaporators where it is concentrated into syrup for crystallization. The
muddy underflow is generally clarified by plate and frame filter presses
though, in two factories, the underflow is pumped back to the mill train
and applied to the bagasse before the last mill. Filter presses are of



ANNEX 3
Page 5
old design, very labor intensive and generally inefficient. The average
loss for Java factories is about 6%, compared with 1-2% in other sugar
areas using rotary vacuum filters.
26.       A few factories have semi-Kestner type evaporators, but most are
of standard design with tubes between 1 and 1.5 meters, installed at low
elevations, so that condensate removal through a barometric leg is not
possible. A central system supplies vacuum in many factories, both for
evaporators and boiling pans. A shortage of injection water is sometimes
a problem. All evaporators are controlled manually and the installation
of a basic juice level control system would improve performance by main-
taining optimum juice levels.
Crystallization
27.       About 75% of the vacuum pans for sugar boiling are coil pans;
the rest, calandria pans. Coil pans are seldom installed today, since
modern calandria pans boil faster, operate on lower pressure steam, and
are cheaper to maintain.
28.       The standard Java sugar boiling system is based on four stages
of crystallization, A,B,C, and D massecuite in order of decreasing purity.
Product sugar is recovered from A and B boilings and D boilings produce final
molasses. After centrifuging, C and D sugars are reprocessed, since
neither is pure enough to be product sugar.
29.       In most factories, all sugars are processed through two sets of
centrifugals or double purges. For A and B sugars, double purging is
necessary with existing equipment to achieve product quality. For C and D
sugars, double purging is practised to remove maximum impurities from the
sugar crystals before reprocessing.
30.       Significant improvements in sugar production and quality are
possible with improved methods and techniques. In most cases, sugar is
boiled by "feel" and experience, and pans are fed in large batch "drinks"
instead of continuously, as is normal practice elsewhere. The consequent
alternate loosening and tightening of the massecuite promotes the formation
of false grain which reduces sugar boiling and centrifugal efficiencies.
31.       Crystallizers accomplish further crystallization by cooling the
D massecuites and are all air-cooled, with ribbon type stirrers. In some
cases, water is applied to the exterior shell of the crystallizer in an
effort to achieve more rapid cooling. The possibility of installing more
efficient water-cooled units should be investigated before installing addi-
tional crystallizer capacity.
32.       Most centrifugals in the Indonesian industry are batch machines
of old design, small size and normally belt or water driven. The belts or
water pumps are usually powered by steam engines. Operation is very labor
intensive. Condition and performance of the centrifugals are such that



ANNEX 3
Page 6
sugars must be double purged to maintain acceptable quality standards - an
unnecessary process with modern high performance machines.
33.       A few continuous centrifugals have recently been installed to
handle C and D massecuites and final molasses purity increases of 3-4 points
have been experienced in tests. However, sugar boiling practices will
have to be improved to obtain satisfactory results with these centrifugals.
Sugar Bagging and Storage
34.       All sugar is-packed in 100 kg net weight jute bags.  Sugar
bagging, weighing and sewing are all manual. Modern packing units use
net weighers, discharging pre-set weights of sugar directly into bags,
which are then closed by sewing machines.
35.       Bagged sugar is stored in warehouses, generally in good condition
and with adequate capacity at current production levels. The industry
guideline for factory storage is 60% of annual sugar production.
36.       Trucks haul away most of the sugar from the factory, though some
is moved by rail. Molasses are generally hauled by rail, but certain areas
depend on road deliveries.

SUGAR PROJECT
Indonesian Sugar Market and Prospects
A. Introduction
1.        Sugar is a basic food 1/ in both rural and urban Indonesia.  General
economic development (rise in per capita incomes) and natural population
increase have resulted in an increase in domestic demand for sugar. Domestic
production, however, has declined due to lack of capital investment in
sugar-processing facilities and technical improvements in cultivation practices,
coupled with political instability. Since 1966 Indonesia has imported varying
quantities of sugar to meet domestic requirements (Table 1). However before
World War II, Indonesia was a major sugar exporting country, and sugar
accounted for three-quarters of Java's exports and contributed more than one
quarter of the total income of the Netherlands' East Indies Government.
2.        The Indonesian Government, fully aware of the potential of this
industry for the development of the agricultural sector, as well as the
economy (Annex 23), is encouraging the modernization and expansion of the
industry aimed at self-sufficiency in sugar production.
B. Demand-Supply and Imports
Demand
3.        Although statistics are imprecise (primarily due to the lack of
population data), per capita consumption of sugar (kg/year) has apparently
increased from about 6 in 1962 to about 7.9 in 1972 (Table 1). This consump-
tion level is in line with most Asian countries. (1969 average for Asia was
about 7.5). The major factors determining future Indonesian sugar demand
are population growth rate, per capita income growth and the relative prices
of sugar and other commodities. The assumptions used to estimate future
demand are outlined in the following paragraphs.
1, Other basic foods are: rice, wheat, salt and edible oil.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
Population
4.        Based on the 1971 population census, the rate of population
growth will be about 2.4% per annum compounded between 1972 and 1980 1/.  The
present slow rate of urbanization in Indonesia will continue until 1980 when
urban population will constitute about 15% of the total.
GNP
5.        In 1968 and 1969, GNP, at constant prices, was rising by 6.9% and
6.2%, respectively, but in 1970 had reached 8%. This higher rate of growth
reflected the policies of stabilization and expansion pursued since 1967,
after a number of years of political and economic disruption. It may
therefore be considered representative of growth rates to be expected of
the Indonesian economy, estimated to be between 7-8% per year at constant
prices between 1972 and 1980, 2/ or, say, an annual average of 7.5%.
Income Elasticity
6.        Income is one of the most powerful determinants of sugar consump-
tion. Income elasticity of sugar demand has been estimated at between
0.8 - 0.9 3/, though accurate data are lacking. Discussions with Government
officials indicated 0.8 as more realistic. There is very little difference
in income elasticity of sugar demand between the rural and urban areas, and
between Java and the Outer Islands 3/.
Prices
7.        Demand is also affected by price, particularly at current levels
of income. However, the lack of fully detailed statistics of consumption,
and the effects of other changes in the general economic and social conditions
over the last decade, make it very difficult to calculate even the most
approximate price elasticity of demand. The practical value of such a
calculation is further reduced by uncertainties as to the range of price
changes due to either fluctuations in the world market or changes in
Government policy, which attempts to stabilize the price because sugar is
a basic food. Moreover, recent price increases, both at ex-factory and at
retail levels, have had no visible negative impact on sugar consumption which
has, on the contrary, appeared to increase slightly. Price is therefore a
less significant factor than income in determining sugar consumption. In
calculating future sugar demand for this Annex, two sets of assumptions have
been made:
1/   The Population Division of the Bank Economics Department and the
Central Bureau of Statistics, GOI, project the same rate.
2/   Country Program Paper - Indonesia, IBRD, February 19, 1972, p. 4.
3/   Indonesian Sugar Study, Annex E5.

(a) with constant prices to the consumer, i.e. prices bearing
the same relationship to general average prices as in 1972;
and
(b)  with consumer prices increasing in relationship to world
market prices (paras 27 and 28).
Industrial Consumpti,l
8.        The industrial use of refined sugar (for food and beverage manufac-
ture) is proportionately small. After considering the future growth of the
food and beverage industry, industrial demand for sugar is estimated to
increase from about 18,000 tons in 1972 to about 40,000 tons by 1980. Current
industrial sugar demand is largely met by imports, since there is no refinery
in the country.
Future Demand
9.        Based  ;       above assumptions, total demand, including that for
industrial purr>f ,-, would increase from an estimated 0.89 M tons in 1972
to about I    i¢ tos in 1980 (Table 2).  Alternative projections based on
the slme ass~.;-ions, but allowing for changes in retail prices, in accordance
with in.ten iational sugar prices, indicate that demand would increase from an
estimated 0.89 M tons in 1972 to about 1.5 M tons by 1980 (Table 2).
Future Supply
10.       Indonesia has 55 sugar factories.  In 1972, total estimated
national sugar production was about 0.89 M tons. Expected increase to about
1.3 M by 1980 includes forecast production from the proposed project (rehabi-
litation of 9 factories) and the proposed Asian Development Bank project
(rehabilitation of two or three factories), and also assumes that the
remaining factories will increase their production by a compounded 3% per
annum to about 1977, through improved field and factory practices (Table 2).
Imports
11.       The demand-supply balance of sugar indicates that Indonesia
will continue to import sugar until 1980 (Table 2); combining the two demand
projections (para 9), on average, about 100,000 tons per year.
C. Sugar Marketing and Distribution
12.       About 85% of total sugar production is marketed and distributed
under GOI direct supervision from Government-owned factories; the remainder
is marketed and distributed by "private" factories independently.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
'listorical Development
13.       Sugar marketing and distribution have undergone considerable
changes in the last four years. Between April 1969 and October 1971,
marketing and distribution were carried otut by about 90 licensed sugar
syndicates, under the supervision of the Ministry of Trade. The syndicates
were groups of trading companies licensed to buy sugar from Government
factories and distribute it in specified zones.  Each syndicate member had
a monthly quota, fixed by government decree, to purchase sugar from a
specified factory. These quotas range(i from 200 to 1,100 tons (doubled
in November and December, the holiday months). Although quotas were fixed
for the whole vear, each syndicate member had to apply each month to the
Ministry of Trade for confirmation of his quota, which could be adjusted
from month to month in accordance with local market conditic7ns and available
supplies.
14.       This systen failed to achieve its basic objectives   L` . egular
supply of sugar countrywide, stable consumer prices, and sufficient compe-
tition to keep trading margins low.  Administrative complexities prevented maptr
syndicate members from being licensed, and a relatively smail number of
wealthy members enjoyed an oligopolistic Position 1/. These few were able
to buy delivery orders from the financially weak, sometimes at a discount,
and hold or dispose of stocks on a speculative basis, often keeping sugay
off the market for as much as three months. This resulted inI risinlg
retail prices for sugar and price fluctuations, varying much more  rom
region to region than differential freight and hlandling costs would Justify.
Moreover, sugar imports were handled by private traders, an(i thks contri-
b-tted further to erratic supply.
The ExistinF_Svstem
15.       From October 1971, marketing and distribution of sugar from
.overnment-oc,ned factories were handed over to BULOC (Badan Urtsan Logistik),
-Government agency reporting directly to the President of the Republic.
'VT LOC has regional offices (DOLOG) all over the country. It is also
responsible for marketing and distributioni of the other basic commodities,
r_.c . whieat, kerosene oil. etc. The new system works as follows:
(a)  the T3anrk Bumi Daya purchases all Government factory
stocks w'ithin three days,
(b) syndicates have been replaced by a large number of
wholesalers (more than 300), with the intention of
reducing the monopolistic position they previously
enjoyed: wholesalers are approved by BULOG on the basis
of qualifications such as financial ability, past
experience in the sugar trade, amount of storage owned,
etc., in order to select the more efficient and
capable f1i rms;
1/   For example, one syndicate member had a monopoly in North Sulawesi,
,whch offici-lly had five licensed distributors.



ANNEX 4
Page 5
(c) the average quota has been considerably reduced;
(d)  imports of sugar are now handled by BULOG itself,
which distributes imports to the licensed wholesalers.
16.       BULOG has divided the country into a number of regions.  On the
basis of demand, monthly allocations are determined for each region and
distributed among the licensed wholesalers, who are required to restrict
sale of their quotas to a specified area. Since domestic production is
not sufficient to meet demand for more than nine months per year, BULOG
releases imported sugar to the wholesalers during the remaining three
months.
17.       Although the  monthly  quota is fixed for a whole year, as
previously, each wholesaler is required to apply to BULOG each month for
a confirmation of his quota. This is ostensibly to allow for monthly
adjustments to be made, depending upon demand and supply. Within seven
days of confirmation, wholesalers pay the Bank Bumi Daya for the allocation
and then collect sugar from the specified factory within 15 days. A penalty
payment is levied if a wholesaler fails to keep to this schedule and, in
the case of outright default, BULOG may suspend his license. After taking
delivery, the wholesalers sell the major proportion to sub-wholesalers who,
in turn, supply retailers. In a few cases (20%), wholesalers also sell
to the retailers directly.
The Cost of Marketing and Distribution
18.       Wholesalers' marketing and distribution costs are:

Since both ex-factory and retail prices are fixed by Government, wholesalers
and retailers have an estimated official profit margin of 5% and 3%,
respectively, as can be seen from the following table:

Transport t±o7
20.       Most sugar is transported internally by road, though rail is also
used, particularly from Central Java to Jakarta. Wholesalers do not own
trucks, but rely entirely on contract hire. Although, in theory, rail is
generally cheaper than road, especially for distances of over 200 km, rail
transportation takes much longer. Timely arrival of consignments is
important in a market where interest rates are high and short-term price
fluctuations frequent. There is also significant loss and damage to sugar
consignments by rail. For these reasons, rail is not used as frequently
as cost comparisons might suggest.
Sugar Storage
21.       Most storage is owned by wholesalers or by private individuals
in consumer centers.  The Bank Bumi Daya and BULOG sugar stock  s kept mostly
in the Government factory stores, which are at a considerable distance from
these centers. This handicaps BULOG's ability to counteract sudden price
rises by releasing additional supplies of sugar to market centers.
Moreover, the condition of much private storage in both East and Central
Java is inadequate. Storage should be studied further to determine the
required capacity and location of facilities to meet the future marketing
requirements of sugar in Indonesia and this has been included in the terms
of reference for the proposed feasibility study (Annex 11).
Shortcomings of the Existing System
22.       Sugar marketing is presently characterized by inefficient distribtu-
tion practices, such as BULOG's requirement that wholesalers' quotas must be
reconfirmed every month and other bureaucratic procedures. This has hindered
the supply to consumers, in spite of its availability even during the processing



ANNEX 4
Page 8
season, resulting in artificially high prices and other social frictions.
In September/ November 1972, for example, free market retail prices ranged
between Rp 115-120/kg compared with Government's fixed prices between Rp 95/kg
(in Java);and Rp 100/kg (in the Outer Islands). The principal reasons are:
(a) Under-estimation of Demand
At present,. BULOG derives per capita consumption (5.8 kg/year)
simply by dividing installed sugar processing capacity by
population. If production is less than expected, the
difference is made up by belated imports. Economic parameters,
which actually determine per capita consumption potential
(per capita income increases being a principal determining
factor) are not taken into consideration.  Based on income
elasticity, per capita consumption in 1972 was close to
8 kg. This under-estimate reflects partly Government's
insistence that the country is nearly self-sufficient in
sugar production and partly the foreign excharg;e scarcity.
There is, therefore, a constantly inadequate supply and
this invites speculation, irrespective of the distribution
and marketing system;.
(b)  Uneven Delivery
(). The situation is aggravated by BULOG's monthly recon-
firmation of quotas; since both demand and supply should
be fairly well-known and stable, this procedure has 'Led
to unneeessary delays and corrupt practices;
(ii) during June, July and August, 1972, BULOG released on
average less than 50% of the monthly quota, in September,
even when retail prices were much higher than the
Government target prices, BULOG released only 75% of
the quota allocated for that month, although sugar was
available in store; BULOG assumes that the portion
withheld will be supplied by private factories;
(iii)  if the full monthly quota were released, BV7LOG asserts
that retail prices would be depressed, wlich in turn
would bring a great financial strain to bear on
wholesalers and retailers, thus causing instability in
the market;
(iv)  in practice, the private factories, which are fully
aware of the market situation, also withhold stocks in
the hope of maximizing their returns; when prices have
thus inevitably risen, in order to obtain their full
quota or even additional allocations, wholesalers
willingly make unofficial payments to BLTLOG (believed
to amount as much as Rp 40/bag).



ANNEX 4
Page 9
Alternative Free Market System
23.       However, if marketing and distribution were left completely free
of controls and reliance placed entirely upon the price mechanism, the same
problems would be encountered as in the 1969/71 syndicate system (para 13).
Almost all sugar importing countries control sugar marketing to some extent
and, if the ex-factory and retail prices were left to be determined entirely
by the free market mechanism, this would tend to create financial uncertainties
and strains for factories, farmers, cane growers and consumers. The
importation of sugar to meet domestic demand until 1980 would also seriously
hamper regulation of the market on price alone.
The Proposed Changes in the Existing System
24.       At the present level of economic development in Indonesia, and
while sugar imports are still necessary, the principal objectives of any
marketing and distribution system for sugar should be to:
(a) guarantee an adequate and stable income to factories
and cane farmers; and
(b) stabilize sugar prices to the consumers.
The present system, in principle, is well designed to meet both these
objectives, since it guarantees a fixed price to the Government factories
which, in turn, leads to a stable and adequate rent for farmers who lease
their land for sugarcane production. Similarly, through selection of a large
number of financially capable wholesalers and fixed retail prices, consumers
should be protected against speculative and monopolistic manipulation. In
addition, a reasonable profit margin is provided for both wholesalers and
retailers.
25.       However, in order to remove the more important shortcomings of the
existing distribution system, the following changes should be introduced:
(a) distribution of sugar should continue to be channeled
through wholesalers, but the selection of wholesalers
and their yearly allocations (broken down into monthly
instalments) should be made by BULOG, the Ministry of
Trade and BAPPENAS together and not by BULOG alone;
(b) the present requirement that wholesalers' quotas be
reconfirmed by BULOG everv month should be withdrawn;
(c) buffer stocks should be established at consumer centers;
(d) licensed wholesalers should be informed annually of
their monthly instalments and of the location of the
factories or stores from which they are to collect their
allocations; they should make payment within a specified
time each month to the Bank Bumi Daya, in accordance with



ANNEX 4
Page 10
their monthly allocations; after payment, the wholesalers
should collect their quotas from the factories or stores
within 15 days;
(e) wholesalerst allocations should be reviewed quarterly,
and in case of emergency or unforeseen circumstances, all
three parties (BULOG, the Ministry of Trade and BAPPENAS)
should determine the required changes; and
(f) BULOG should remain responsible for imports and distribute
imported sugar through licensed wholesalers.
26.       The proposed changes would assist in maintaining an adequate supply
and would reduce existing bureaucratic procedures in marketing distribution.
This, in turn, would help to check speculative and monopolistic activities
at present found in the sugar marketing system in Indonesia. At the same
time, the present mechanism for calculating demand and the desirability of
meeting shortfall from imports, taking into consideration the scarcity of
foreign exchange, should be reviewed.
D. Prices
International
27.       Average free world market prices (960 raw sugar, cif London),
characterized by wide monthly fluctuations, increased from USS110 in 1970
to US$130/ton in 1971 and to US$155/ton in 1972. Exceptionally high prices
for all agricultural commodities were recorded internationally in 1972 due
to poor crops, resulting mainly from drought; hence these prices do not
indicate a permanent trend. Sugar prices increased sharply in 1971/1972
mainly because a poor crop in USSR and a significant decline in Cuba's
output led to worldwide shortages which persisted through 1972/73. Never-
theless, based on long-term worldwide demand-supply analyses 1/, up-dated
by the Bank's Economics Department, average international free market sugar
prices (cif London) are expected to increase only to about US$170/ton by
1975, rising to US$180/ton by 1980, at which time the present supply deficit
would be reduced and be closer to equilibrium with demand. The sharp rise
in costs of production and investment would contribute to higher average free
international market prices. Actual prices for any particular year will
deviate from the trend due to weather, which causes sharp swings in supply,
particularly since demand is inelastic in the short-term.

Domestic
28.       Ex-factory prices (per 100 kg bag), deternined by the Ministries
of Agriculture and Trade, follow international price trends and consequently
rose from about Rp 4,700 in 1970 to Rp 5,500 in 1971 and Rp 6,450 in 1972.
Government indicated retail prices also increased from Rp 85/kg in 1970 to
Rp 100/kg in 1972. As long as sugar imports are required, internal prices
cannot differ too widely from average free world prices. Hence it is
projected that present ex-factory price will increase to about Rp 7,100
by 1975 and Rp 7,400/bag by 1980.
By-Products
29.       Incremental molasses production would be exported.  No signifi-
cant increase is foreseen in the present ex-factory price of Rp 5,800/ton
(US$14).

SUGAR PROJECT
Proposals for Major Rehabilitation
I. General
1.        The factories for major rehabilitation (double underlined on Maps
10285/6) are:
Capacity (tons cane pertday)
PNP                                     Present       Proposed
XV        Sragi                          1,600           3,600
XXI       Pesantren                      1,550           3,000
XXII      Gempolkrep                     1,500           3,000
2.        They have been selected on the following criteria:
(a) sufficient suitable land is available to increase cane supply
by at least 125%, so as to meet increased capacity and number
of days milling;
(b) farmers in the area appear willing to make additional land
available to the factory on lease for planting, followed by
ratooning by the factory or by the farmers themselves;
(c) the factory is physically capable of expansion;
(d) cane transport can readily be improved or expanded at
reasonable cost;
(e) cost per ton of sugar can be reduced;
(f) the factory is not likely to be absorbed by amalgamation
with other units over the next ten years;
(g) rehabilitation would result in continuous reliable operation
for about 20 years; and
(h) the financial rate of return (before tax) on new investment,
calculated on a discounted cash flow for 20 years from
commencement of rehabilitation, would be at least 20% per
year, unless there were special reasons to accept a lower



ANNEX 5
Page 2
return, (e.g. in the case of Pesantren, which already has
a higher annual rate of production and a large amount of
farmers' cane).
3.        In every case, before rehabilitation is planned, a survey would
be made to ensure adequate land is made available by farmers. (Terms of
Reference in Annex 7.)
4.        Regulations on land use would permit ratooning in factory
concession areas for at least one season. In forecasting production, it is
assumed that extension of factory cane planting on available land would be
relatively easy and well understood but that initiation or extension of
factory ratooning would take place slowly, as experience is gained, at the
minimum rates indicated. Where more ratooning is possible, the area under
plant cane could be reduced, at cost savings to the factory. Planned ex-
pansion is outlined in Part II of this Annex.
5.        It is further assumed that, with rehabilitation, the days on which
factories could be operated would increase from the present 120/150 up to
180 per year. Yields (TCH) would gradually increase as technical guidance
and improved practices take effect. Rendement is expected to improve through
better field and factory practices, including some late irrigation of mature
cane, but this would be offset to some extent by the longer time the cane
would be left in the field to permit the longer factory operating periods.
6.        Drainage would be improved by the field staff and fertilizer
trials extended by the sugar research station.
7.        Further details of cane production plans are in Part II, and of
factory rehabilitation in Part III of this Annex.
8.        Before rehabilitation, detailed plans would be made by the Engineering
Services, for desk review by IDA and approval by the PT owning the factories.
Engineering Services would, after approval, be responsible for supervising
the rehabilitation according to the general plan outlined in Part III of
this Annex. Strict economy is essential and serviceable items should be left
in operation, where possible, until they need replacement. The expected
life of such items would be indicated in the detailed plans.
II. Cane Production
A. Sragi Area
9.        Sragi's 1972 production was 21,400 tons sugar from 1,600 ha factory
plant cane. After major rehabilitation, production would be 73,200 tons from
5,500 ha (Table 1).



ANNEX 5
Page 3
10.       To obtain t!his production:
(a) factory plant cane would be increased in the Sragi-Jomal
area to its limit (3,188 ha); planting would then be
extended to Bandjardwa to the extent necessary to bring
the total up to 3,500 ha.
(b) factory ratoon cane would be grown up to about 1,500 ha
43% of the planted area); to the extent that ratooning
is not possible, additional land would be planted in
Bandjardwa or other expansion areas;
Cc) ratooning by farmers would be introduced but, in view
of the lack of experience of this practice in the Sragi
area, the initial target would be 500 ha, or about 14%
of the planted area (to be expanded in place of planted
cane to the extent desired);
(d) yields (TCH) would improve from 115 to 130 on planted
cane, 85 to 100 on factory ratoon and 70 to 80 on farmers'
cane;
(e)  no c.    .uld be planted in Kalimati;
(f)l    ianization of field operations would be carried out.
B. Pesantren Area
11.       Pesantren's 1972 production was 26,500 tons sugar from 1,307 ha
factory plant cane and 1,600 ha farmer ratoon cane. After major rehabili-
tation production would be about 60,000 tons from 5,650 ha (Table 2).
12.       To obtain this production:
(a) in the present concession area, plant cane would be increased
slightly to 1,400 ha and a ratoon crop taken from 100 ha
in 1975/77; factory ratooning would be increased if possible;
(b) farmers would continue to grow first and second ratoon crops
up to 2,000 ha per year;
(c) unirrigated Jenkol land, totalling 3,600 ha on long lease, is already
partially planted by the adjoining Gadiredjo factory; cane
from 400 ha would be purchased for Pesantren in 1976 and up
to 3,000 ha would be transferred progressively to Pesantren
from 1977; at least 900 ha would be planted at Jenkol each
year (more in 1977 and 1978 to build up a base for ratooning)
and as much of this as the factory could accommodate would
be ratooned twice, with a fallow period before replanting;



ANNEX 5
Page 4
(d) timing of agricultural operations is particularly important
for rainfed cane (time lost in planting after rain cannot
be made up by irrigating the land) and the Jenkol area would
be cultivated mechanically; two crawler tractors with
related equipment would be purchased for delivery in 1975
and one for 1976;
(e) irrigated yields (TCH) would improve from 104 to 125 on
planted cane and 64 to 75 on farmers' cane; 85-95 would be
possible on irrigated and 85 on Jenkol ratoon; Jenkol
planted yield (rainfed) would be a steady 115.
C. Gempolkrep Area
13.       Gempolkrep's 1972 production was about 20,000 tons sugar from
1,694 ha factory plant cane and 21 ha farmer ratoon caun;  4. F,r major
rehabilitation, production would be 61,200 tons from 5,000 ha (Table 3).
14.       To obtain this production:
(a) factory plant cane would be increased from 1,694 to
3,200 ha in the present concession area and additional
areas northeast, west and south of the present area, which
would be brought under irrigation by factory installad
pumps; water for these areas is planned to be available
in 1976;
(b)  factory ratoon cane would be grown up to about i ,300
ha (41% of the plauted area);
(c)  farmers ratoon area would be increased gradually to 500 ha;
in view of alternative crops available and lack of
previous experience of newly irrigated lands, this would
be an initial target (to be expanded in place of planted
cane to the extent desired); and
(d) mechanization of field operations would not be necessary.
III. Factory Rehabilitation
A. Improvements Common To All Three Factories
15.       Rehabilitation activity outlined in the following paras would
be common to all three factories.



ANNEX 5
Page 5
Steam and Power Generation
16.  (a)  Construct new bulk storage for bagasse and install
a reliable bagasse reclaim system and conveyors so that
bagasse from the mills can be conveyed to the boiler
and excess bagasse stored in the bagasse house (the
bagasse reclaim system would ensure that bagasse could
be continually fed to the boilers, whether or not the
factory was milling cane);
(2' relocate bagasse baling machine to new bagasse storage
so that surplus bagasse can be baled for use as steam
locomotive fuel; and
(c) install new high and low voltage switchgear in a new
central control panel, equipped to permit parallel
operation of all generating units; install sub-stations
for primary and secondary distribution.
Milling Plant
17.  (a)  Make r~zreful inspection to confirm whether the existing
,!rs and mills are in satisfactory condition and
out any necessary repairs and replacements before
Owering; and
(b) replace existing white metal bearings by bronze bearings
to permit higher mill speeds and loadings; investigate
existing mill hydraulics to evaluate the advantages of
installing "Edwards" type hydraulic units.
Cane Transport
18.       Rationalize harvesting and loading by having each operation
carried out by separate gangs so that railcars can be loaded throughout
the day (with the present system, using the same gang for harvesting and
loading, trains are not ready for hauling until the afternoon; the objective
of the proposed system is to have trains ready for hauling once by noon and
again later in the afternoon).
Workshop Equipment
19.  (a)  Upgrade existing belt driven machine tools, still in
satisfactory condition, by installing individual electric
motors;
(b) procure worksaving maintenance equipment, such as pneumatic
hoists, pipe threading machines, mechanical steel saws,
we'ding machines, hydraulic pipe bending machines, etc.,
so that the factory workforce can effectively assist in
the factory rehabilitation program; and
(c) procure selected machine tools for factory workshops.

25.  (a)  Six vacuum pans provide 1,260 hl total sugar boiling
capacity; about 3,000 hl capacity would be required to
handle the expanded production; install four 400 hl (or
equivalent) pans to provide the additional capacity;
(b) about 3,000 hl of crystallizer capacity is available and
7,000 hl would be required for 3,600 TCD; investigate
feasibility of converting existing aircooled units to
more efficient watercooled design, at about the same
cost as additional aircooled units; install 13 additional
300 hl aircooled crystallizers with ribbon stirrers
or convert installation to watercooled system and add
units of equivalent capacity; and
(c) rehabilitate existing pumps, piping, tanks, etc. and provide

Proposals for Minor Rehabilitation
I. General
1.        The factories provisionally selected for minor rehabilitation
(single underlined on Maps 10285/6) are listed below, with those of second
priority in parenthesis.
Present Annual
PNP          Factory               Production
(Tons sugar)
XIV         (Jatiwangi)               7,750
Tersana Baru            25,000
(Gempol)                 10,000
XV          (Bandjaratma)            14,700
Sumberhardjo            13,500
Cepiring                14,300
Rendeng                 15,500
XVI          Ceper Baru              13,400
projosragen              19,900
(Tasikmadu)              25,000
XXI         (Lestari)                18,000
XXII        (Cukir)                   13,000
2.        Final selection would be based on the following criteria:
(a)  sufficient suitable land available to increase cane
supply by at least 75%;



ANNEX 6
Page 2
(b) farmers in area willing to make sufficient additional
land available for factory planting and some ratooning
by the factory or by the farmers themselves;
(c) factory physically capable of expansion and completion
of rehabilitation;
(d) cane transport can readily be improved to accommodate
additional crop;
(e) cost per ton of sugar can be reduced:
(f) factory rehabilitation and related cane supply would
not inlibit plans for amalgamation with other units or
major rehabilitation of the subject factory, within the
next 10-15 years;
(g) rehabilitation would result in continuous reliable
operation for a minnium of ten years from completion;
(h)  the financial rate of rettrn (before tax) on new invest-
ment, calculated on a discounted cash flow for 15 years
from commencement of rehabilitation, would be at least
25% per year.
3.        In every case, before rohabili£tation is planned, a survey would
be made to ensure adequate land 'ts uade available by farmers (Terms of
Reference in Annex 7) and a cane production plan would be prepared by the
factory management.
4.        Assumptions, as to land use regulations, extensions of cane
production and days grinding, improvement in yield, rendement and drainage,
and extension of fertilizer trials, would be the same as for major rehabili-
tation (Annex 5, paras 4-7).
5.        Before rehabilitation, detailed plans would be made by Engineering
Services, following thorough survey Of the factories selected, for approval
bv the Boards of the PT owning them, and for appraisal by the consulting firm
retained by the Bank Bumi Daya for this purpose. Strict economy is essential
and serviceable items should be left in operation, where possible, until
they need replacement. The expected life of such items would be indicated
in the detailed plans. The appraisals would be subject to desk review and
approval by IDA. Engineering Services would, after approval, be responsible
for supervising the rehabilitation according to the detailed plan prepared
for the particular factory, which would generally cover the items referred
to in Part II of this Anxnex.



ANNEX 6

II. General Plan for Rehabilitation
6.        Except for Tersana Baru and Rendeng, to a limited extent, the
factories scheduled for minor rehabilitation do not have electric power to
drive modern higher performance machinery and equipment, and, as for the
major rehabilitation, effort would be concentrated on steam and electric
power generation, which would be about half the total investment. In
addition, typical improvements would be as in the following paragraphs.
7.   (a)  Improve cane unloading and handling by installing
variable speed rotating feeder tables to minimize
interruption in the cane feed to the milling train;
(b) convert from wooden slats to steel slats for the
main cane carrier to permit more efficient knifing;
(a) install knives where necessary to increase capacity
and improve mill feed.
8.   (a)  Modify ntermediate mill carriers to allow use of
increased imbibition water;
(b) inscail more effective imbibition systems to increase
extraction efficiency;
(c) increase mill hydraulic pressures, when feasible, and
run routine trix diagrams for milling control;
(d) use Messchaert juice grooves on feed rolls to improve
Juice drainage.
9.   (a)  Install automatic temperature controls for juice heaters;
(b) install basic evaporator levels controls to maintain
juice levels for optimum evaporation;
(c) rehabilitate condensate removal systems.
10.       Where feasible, replace batch settling tanks and plate and frame
filter presses with tray type clarifiers and rotary vacuum filters.
11.  (a)  Provide instrumentation (e.g. pressure vacuum and tempera-
tures gauges) at process control points for the heaters,
evaporators, vacuum pans and other stations;
(b) evaluate the feasibility of installing absolute pressure
controls for vacuum pans;
(c) install cuitometers to guide sugar boiling.



ANNEX 6
Page 4
12.  (a)  Install feed chutes with rotary feeders between the
bagasse conveyor and boilers;
(b) investigate the condensate collection system and,
install a system to minimize the risk of sugar conta-
mination.
13.       A typical list of machinery and equipment for.minor,,rehabilitation
is in Annex 13, Table 4.

SUGAR PROJECT
Draft Terms of Reference for Cane Supply Survey
Composition of Survey Team
1.        The sase team, so far as possible, would be engaged by all the PT,
coordinated by the Joint Sugar Projects Unit, and would consist of a
sugarcane economist and an agricultural economist, assisted by the village
headmen in the area to be surveyed. Specified factory staff would be assigned
to assist with the survey, with one staff member primarily responsible for
co-ordination.
Phasing
2.        The Joint Sugar Projects Unit would determine the order in which the
surveys would be conducted, beginning with the factories initially selected
for rehabilitation under the project. Each survey is expected to take two
to three weeks, on average, including reporting.
Rent
3.        The survey would particularly study land rents paid by sugar
factories and would make recommendations to them on equitable rents for the
land they require, separately for plant and ratoon cane, having regard to:
(a) the opportunity cost of the different areas of land required,
based on net income from alternative crops;
(b) the rental period and the discounted value of rent and
alternative net income;
(c) the risk involved;
(d) the incentive required to persuade farmers to sacrifice
alternative net income for rental income;
(e) employment opportunities and the economic value
(shadow price) of labor;
(f) ability of factories to pay.
The survey would also make recommendations on procedures for fixing rents
over periods longer than the traditional 16 months, decide on and advise
SCS of criteria and formulae to be used in calculating equitable rents, and
justify its conclusions.



ANNEX 7

4         Tine survey would determine for each factory:
(a) total area of factory concession;
(b) area currently in factory cane; estimated yields;
(c)  area ?urrently in farmers' cane; estimated yields;
(d) area available for expansion by factory, within concession
area, divided into area available for planting and area
available for factory ratoon; estimated yields;
(e)  area available for ratooning by farmers within conces-
sion area regardless of factory capacity; estimated yields;
(f)  at rents proposed, and existing prices for sugar and other
crops:
(i)  what area farmers would be -illing to lease;
estim.ate  yelds;
(ii) wh.at total area farmers would be willing to ratoon;
the nunber of years' ratooning desired; estimated
yields.
Conclusions
5,       tOn conclusion of the survey, the factory would prepare and agree
with the survey team a plan for annual supply of cane over the next five
years in a form similar to the attached Appendix.
6.        On completior of the survey of the factories scheduled for
rehabilitation, the team would continue surveys for the remaining factories
according to a schedule agreed with the Joint Sugar Projects Unit.
7.        Based on 36 man days for each of the first 9 factories, or 324
man days, and 1,296 man days for the remaining 36 factories, at a cost of
Rp 6,250/day for two men, plus other costs of Rp 5,000/day, a total of
Rp 11,250/day, the total cost of the surveys would be Rp 18.2 M.
8.        The survey team would be called upon each year to assist SCS in
the determination of rents appropriate to the areas in which sugar is grown.

SUGAR PROJECT
Cane Farming
1.        Cane farming by individual farmers for supply to sugar factories
has not been practiced on any significant scale in the project factory
areas, except at Pesantren, where farmers ratoon about 1,600 ha of the
previous season's crop, planted by the factory on land rented to it. Though
profitable, farmers are not able to undertake cane cultivation because of
lack of finance and technical advice. Credit is both difficult to get
and expensive to service and poor cane yields result from lack of technical
knowledge.
2.        Project production forecasts assume a moderate proportion of ratoon
crops would be cultivated by farmers. With suitable arrangements for farmer
credit and effective extension services, it would be possible to encourage
them to grow ratoon crops and thus enable the factories to concentrate on
high-quality plant cane.
3.        Bank Rakyat (BRI), already organized to extend credit to rice
farmers through the GOI BIMAS scheme, would be the most appropriate source of
institutional credit, and would be willing to undertake credit to cane farmers
under the project. Under the BIMAS rice scheme individual farmers are eligible
for seasonal rice production loans granted by BRI through its several
village units.  FIla                     l_oan applications, and these are
countersigned by the vil 1 .bea.dian who con                  fi     0 f-he  i
obtain farm inputs in kind from TiciT7sY5WanLb.  nErovioe   e oiTnce
of thie loFin cash for living expenses.  M-E'fl    an, which carries interest at
1% per month, is repaid by the farmers as soon as possible after the rice
harvest.
4.        Factory management, being the party most interested in good reliable
cane supply, would provide the extension services necessary. Farmers wishing
to supply cane to a factory would register with it and enter into a contract
to supply from the registered area. They would then apply to BRI for a loan
to cover cultivation and harvesting cost, estimated at about Rp 100,000
(US$ 240) per hectare, with the recommendation of the factory extension
officer. The initial rate of interest proposed is 1.25% per month, which
would be acceptable to cane farmers.
5.        The cost of cultivating one hectare of ratoon cane is estimated as
follows:

Total cost (excluding rent)        118,000
6.        It would be desirable to make physical delivery of fertilizer
and not lend farmers cash for its purchase, and this would be organized,
as it now is, by the factories. The cash cost of Rp 100,000/ha, which includes
living expenses, would be advanced by BRI in three installments, each depending
an satisfactory performance to date, as indicated below:
Rupiah
Commencement of cultivation
(when signing loan agreement)        40,000
3 months after commencement          30,000
1 month prior to harvest             30,000
100,000
7.        Disbursement for fertilizer would be made with the assistance
of the factory. The factories would purchase that quantity estimated to
be the season's requirements of the farmers and distribute it to them
in return for fertilizer slips, to be issued by BRI to the farmers at
the time they sign a loan agreement. The factories would be reimbursed for
fertilizer supplied by returning the credit slips to BRI periodically.
The borrowing farmer's cane would be processed by the factory and 50% (or such
other percentage as may be agreed) of the value of the sugar content would
be paid to him in cash or kind, at his option, after deducting any amounts
owing to BRI, as evidenced by a certificate from BRI which every borrowing
farmer would produce on collection of his proceeds.



ANNEX 8
Page 3
8.        Each PT participating in the project would make arrangements with
BRI for the provision of credit to cane farmers and employ full time a
qualified and experienced senior staff member to arrange for the provision
of credit and technical advice to those willing to supply cane to its
factories. Each factory would establish and maintain a Department of Cane
Farmer's Affairs, headed by an agricultural executive, directly responsible
to the general manager, for both extension services and BRI liaison. He
would be assisted by senior field managers, each of whom would be responsible
for about 500 ha of farmer's cane. Each senior field manager would have
two assistants; one to liaise with and assist BRI and arrange fertilizer
procurement and distribution; and the other to make field visits and advise
farmers on cultivation methods, harvesting and other problems of cane
production. A field supervisor (mandor) would be responsible to a senior
field manager for cane farming operations in each village supplying cane.
Each field assistant would be able to look after the needs of about 250 ha
or, say, 500 cane farmers.
9.        Cane farm size would average about 0.5 ha, except on Pesantren.
On Sragi and Gempolkrep the number of farmers to be served would be 1,000
each; on Pesantren, where cane farming is projected to increase from 1,600
ha to 2,000 ha, the total number of farm units is not expected to be more
than 1,000 since most of the existing 1,600 ha is cultivated by some 50
contractors and farmer groups with the number of farm tnits totalling, perhaps,
200. Pour extension officers would therefore be adequate for Pesantren. On
the factories where minor rehabilitation is planned, cane cultivation by
farmers would be experimental (an average total of 200 ha or, say, 400
farmers) and one senior field manager would suffice for each.

IND0NESIA
SUGAR PROJECT
Engineering Services and Technical Assistance
1.        Production targets set for the Indonesian sugar industry can only
be achieved if the industry is efficiently managed. Present management
provides a healthy nucleus on which to base future development, but isolation
of the industry has deprived it of contact with worldwide developments in
sugar technology and in cane growing techniques. In the short term, this
deprivation can only be corrected by external assistance. In the long term,
development of a competitive and viable industry, staffed entirely by
Indonesians, will depend on carefully planned and systematic training programs
for all levels of staff.
Engineering Services
2.        Factory management and staff have been pre-occupied with the
difficult task of keeping old factories going with spares hard to get and
funds hard to come by. They have had little opportunity for, and consequently
little experience in, planning the modernization of the plant and machinery
in their care. The scale and complexity of rehabilitation and expansion
of the Indonesian sugar industry, of which the project is a first phase, are
too great to be superimposed bn management staff responsible for day-to-day
operations and would need engineering services beyond those now available in
Indonesia. These services would therefore be provided by a consulting firm
under one contract entered into initially by the sugar PNP, to be adopted
by the sugar PT as soon as they are formed.
3.        Headed by a Chief, Engineering Services, the consultants' team
would be responsible for overall planning, preparation and implementation
of factory rehabilitation. Major rehabilitation is intended to result in
continuous reliable operation for about 20 years, and minor rehabilitation
for about 10 years. Strict economy is essential and serviceable equipment
is intended to remain until it needs replacement.
4.        The Engineering Services would provide access to current developments
in engineering design and process technology and managerial experience in the
implementation of large-scale major projects. Long-term requirements would
be fulfilled by training suitable qualified Indonesians to take over as soon
as possible; but three years would be a minimum safe period.
5.        The consulting firm would provide the following seven individuals,
all qualified by training and experience: Chief, Engineering Services;
Financial Manager; Technical Manager; Sugar Technologist (modern sugar
production methods and equipment); Mechanical Engineer (steam power plants
and sugar factory machinery and equipment); Electrical Engineer (electrical



ANNEX 9

pow-er generation and distribution for sugar factories); Civil Engineer
(foLundation and structural design for sugar factories and rail transport
svste,s)
6.        Design engineering consultants would be engaged by the consulting
firm, as required, to assist in preparation of detailed designs, specifications
and tenders.  niese consultants would also be required to assist in
supe':visiLo  of factory construction and rehabilitation work through to
7.        More detailed Terms of Reference for Engineering Services are in
Appendix A to this Annex.
3.        A consulting firm, different from that employed for Engineering
Services, would be hired by the Bank Bumi Daya on retainer to provide the
3e.;ices of a financial analyst (leader), a sugar technologist and other
exp3zer--ise, as necessary, to carry out appraisal of the minor rehabilitation
subpro,ects as they were prepared by the PT, with assistance from Engineering
Services. They would require about 27 man-months, together witti transportation
and acco-modation. and would be employed over a period of about two years,
begianmng about: nine months from conmencement of the project.  Guidelines
for appraisal are in Appendix B to this Annex.
'Operational Services
9.        Sugar PNP management is generally out of touch with modern techniques
for suarzcane growing and processing and needs specialist advice to introduce
imoproved methods.  PNP accounts are not up to date and, though detailed and
elaborate records are kept, they are not consistent in composition and
definitions and it is difficult to extract meaningful management accounting
information from them. Cost accounting is virtually nonexistent and at no
levei is management cost conscious, though capital expenditures are more
or less controlled within budgets approved by BCU. PT therefore need the
,4ervices of a financial advisor, a sugar technologist and a sugarcane field
ipec alist to help them introduce and disseminate improvements.  The Financial
ldvisor would reorganize accounting and financial control procedures and
introduce an effective management accounting and costing system. The Factory
Advisor would assist in improving production methods, transport organization,
sligar techniology and quality control; and the Field Advisor would concentrate
on cultivation practices, including irrigation and drainage, cane breeding,
varie.ty selection, wider use of ratooning, disease and pest control, fertilizer
and other field trials, and harvesting methods.
10.       Consultant firms would be invited to offer these services to one
or more PT and 399 man-months are provided; though there could be savings
iv one f£irm is able to serve more than one PT.  Terms of Reference are in
A ppeendix C to this Annex.

II. Stages of Rehabilitation Work
Preliminary Design
10.       The rehabilitation work would be divided into three programs.  The
first would comprise the major rehabilitation of three factories, together
with the minor rehabilitation of two others; the second, to commence about
one year later, would comprise the minor rehabilitation of four factories;
and the third, concurrently with or consecutively to the second, would
comprise preparation of plans and estimates (but not implementation) for
minor rehabilitation of six further factories. For factories selected in
the first program, all major items of equipment would be sized after
preliminary engineering studies, and orders placed by international competitive
bidding; all existing equipment would be inspected during the 1973 crop
season to verify mechanical operation and, upon completion of the crop, to
verify structural integrity.
11.       For factories selected in the first program, major equipment sizing
and specifications would be submitted to the Joint Sugar Projects Unit by
March 31, 1974; other equipment specifications would be submitted by June 30,
1974; and all preliminary design work would be completed by September 30,
1974. Factories selected for the second program would follow a similar timetable
one year later.
Final Design
12.       Final design work would proceed upon placement of equipment
orders and receipt of suppliers equipment drawings. Construction drawings
and specifications would be included in the final design work. Final lists
of material, equipment and supplies would be submitted to PT management by
the Chief, Engineering Services.
Construction Management
13.       All construction for first program rehabilitation and expansion
would be phased to be completed for operation during the 1977 crop; for the
second program, one year later.

SUGAR PROJECT
Sugar Research
A. Background
1.        The first sugar experiment stations in Indonesia were at Semarang
in Central Java, founded as far back as 1885 and at Pasaruan in East Java,
started in 1887. Semarang was closed in 1925 and all research has since
been centered at Pasuruan.
2.        The widespread incidence of sereh disease created a crisis in 1881
that led to importation of many cane varieties from other islands and from
abroad. Some of these were planted directly by the factories and others
played an important part in the highly successful cane breeding program
that produced such varieties as POJ 2,878, recognized worldwide as outstand-
ing. Pasuruan helped to pioneer commodity research stations in sugar and
other crops, and was regarded as one of the best sugar research organizations
in the world.
3.        When the Japanese occupied Java in 1942, they carefully preserved
the station and carried out programs that had been laid out by the Dutch.
Unfortunately, in 1947, during a clash between Indonesians and Dutch forces,
the station library was burned.
4.        In 1958, the station became the responsibility of the Directorate-
General of Estate Crops (BCU) of the Ministry of Agriculture. The Director
of the station is responsible to a PNP Directorate, of which the head is the
BCU Director for Region No. 4. The BCU Director also heads a special
committee to supervise the station, the other members of which are the
First Directors of the eight sugar PNP and one Director from each of the
three private sugar companies. Under the Director of the station are the
Heads of three Divisions: Agriculture, Technology, and External Services.
B. Present Position
5.        Since 1970, sugar research has been financed by a compulsory levy
of one percent of the ex-factory sugar sale proceeds. In 1972, this exceeded
Rp 400 M (US$1 M). However, funds for operation of the station were very
short from 1958 until 1970. As a consequence, though the buildings are in
good repair and adequate in size, there is a shortage of equipment.



ANNEX 10
Page 2
6.        The Agriculture Division has a breeding section with a geneticist
and a physiologist. In 1972 it made 800 crosses which will produce 100,000
new seedlings for future testing. After two years of selection, some of
the 200-400 varieties that have not been discarded will be sent to substa-
tions for further testing. Eventually about 25 of the varieties will be
tested on factory land, but only two or three survive the selection program
each year and are given permanent PS variety numbers. A quarantine station
for imported varieties is maintained on the island of Madura, and 15 to 20 are
imported each year.  Varieties are tested for disease resistance, but little
work is being done on breeding and selection for good ratooning qualities.
Also in Agriculture are sections for crop protection, with an entomologist,
a pathologist and an agronomist; a soils and fertilizer; and statistics.
7.        The Technology Division does experimental work on juice purifica-
tion, crystallization, use of chemicals, etc. and operates a laboratory
for analysis of sugars, molasses, etc. for the factories.
8.        The External Affairs Division has three representatives on
substations in three parts of East and Central Java. In addition to
supervising the substations, they maintain contact with the factories,
give technical assistance for field trials, and supply seed for trials
and nurseries.
9.        The research station is trying to upgrade its staff by sending
them for training to various courses in Indonesia, and three to five people
per year are sent for study or to conferences abroad for three to six
months. This program should be continued and, if possible enlarged; however,
with the shortage of trained and competent staff, the research work suffers
if many are away and more staff are needed.
C. Project Proposals
10.       The station has suffered from insufficient contact with other
sugar research institutions and lack of exposure to international academic
standards. To strengthen the station, an advisory or consulting service
would be established with a leading sugar research institution or inter-
nationally recognized scientific group, to provide guidance periodically over
the next five years. Visiting staff needed for such guidance would be: an
advisor to the Director and, subject to confirmation with the advisor,
an entomologist, a plant pathologist and a statistician; alternatively,
a geneticist or a plant physiologist or a soils physicist might be selected
in place of any one of these (see Drafts Terms of Reference in Appendix).
11.       These scientists would be responsible to the Director for ad-
vising section heads, assisting in planning and evaluating research programs.
Initial visits would be for six months with two visits in the second year
to total three months and one month visits in the next three years.



ANNEX 10
Page 3
12.       The following full time resident staff would be hired locally,
if available, to bring the size of the staff to an acceptable level: a
geneticist; a plant physiologist; an irrigation agronomist; a soil physicist;
two sugar technologists; an instrument technologist; one assistant for each
of the above. For estimate purposes, it is assumed that five of these
resident staff would be expatriate.
13.       The advisory or consulting service would review the research
equipment available and recommend additions, within an agreed budget of
US$350,000, estimated to be sufficient to make up for major deficiencies.
14.       To overcome the lack of exposure of the staff to other sugar
research institutions, funds should be made available to send five staff
members each year for about six months on an overseas orientation visit for
each of the next five years (see Table 1).
15.       Estimated costs of the above are in the attached Table 1;
estimated research equipment needs and costs are in Table 2.
16.       The research station should continue to be supervised by a Board
of Directors (see para 4) on which the new PT would be represented. If a
national agricultural research organization is formed, there should be full
cooperation between that body and the sugar research station, but sugar
research should be independent of it.

SUGAR PROJECT
Prospects for Sugar Production in New Areas
A. General
1.        The basic requirements for growing sugar cane are discussed in
Annex 2. Although it is a tolerant crop and techniques can be adapted to
suit different conditions, yield and quality are greatly affected by
climate. Soil and topography are also significant. For new areas, land
and labor supply are important and infrastructure availability would
affect the economics of a new sugar enterprise. ISS Report Chapter 10 and
Volume IX (Appendix F) detail the basic factors and refer to specific areas
examined.
2.        The capital cost of a new sugar factory, per unit of output, falls
sharply as daily production rises up to, say, 4,000 TCD and, in the field,
there are significant advantages in larger units of operation. A primary
consideration in the selection of new areas is therefore the availability
of blocks of land of at least 5,000 ha on a permanent basis or long lease
to allow monoculture of cane, as successfully practised in other countries.
B. Java
3.        Two possible sites for development, referred to by ISS, are
Hutan Lojang in West Java and Banjuwangi-Muntja in South-east Java. Hutan
Lojang is west north-west of Tjirebon at an elevation of 45-90 meters with
almost flat to slightly rolling terrain. There are approximately 28,000 ha
that have not had much development because they lacked irrigation. Soils
are adequate but, though annual rainfall is about 2,000 mm, irrigation would
have to be developed to realize the full yield potential. Sugar trials are
presently under way at this site.
4.        The Banjuwangi-Muntjar area has high quality soils and good
supplies of irrigation water in an area of 124,500 ha. However, it is
densely populated and intensively farmed with rice and other crops. A
part of this area might be developed for sugar cane, but high population
density would mitigate against large scale development.



ANNEX 1 1
Page 2
C. Outside Java
5.        Outside Java the best prospects for development, referred to by
ISS, appear to be in South Sulawesi and in South Sumatra. Other possible
development sites are on the islands of West Irian, Flores, Sumbwa, Sumbawa
and Sumba.
Sulawesi
6.        In South Sulawesi, in addition to Bone, there are six areas that
could be considered, and trials are in progress at three of them:
(a) Takalar has 2,500 ha of Government land and 3,000 ha
additional land could be acquired; climate and soils
are satisfactory but irrigation water would have to
be developed;
(b)  Segeri has a possible 4-5,000 ha of land for cortinuous
cane cultivation; climate and soils are satisfactory
and, because of high rainfall, little irrigation would
be necessary; and
(c) Baranti could have 3,000 ha of Government land and could
rent an additional 8,500 ha; rainfall is irregular, how-
ever, and irrigation would have to be developed.
7.        Other areas in Sulawesi are:  Tjaming where 7,300 ha of Govern-
ment land might be made available. Polewali with an estimated area of
4,000 ha, Tonra-Mare with about 4,000 ha, and Wawotomi Kendari with
10,000 ha.
8.        At Bone, an unassembled factory has been on site for several
years but failure to solve technical cultural problems, particularly
drainage, has prevented development of adequate cane production. Climatic
conditions favor sugar cane and annual rainfall of about 2,000 mm is
well distributed over eight months, so irrigation may not be necessary.
A six-ha trial planting is under way and yields of 12.47 tons sugar/ha (TSH)
have been obtained with the addition of nitrogen, phosphate and potash; so
large-scale development could be contemplated with a reasonable chance of
success.
Sumatra
9.        In Sumatra, cane trials are in progress at Gunungbaten.  Rainfall
is variable and irrigation water needs to be developed. Approximately
18,000 ha might be available. Other areas in Sumatra are Kalinda, which
is not recommended by ISS because of soil and drainage conditions, and
Rantau Prapat with an area of 23,000 ha and irregular rainfall, where a
private company has established a small area of sugar cane for observation..



ANNEX I 1
Page 3
10.       In North Sumatra, at Tjot Girek, a factory has been erected with
a concession area of 7,891 ha, of which over 4,800 ha is regarded as suitable
for cane. Well distributed rainfall is in excess of 2,000 m but there is
no pronounced dry season, which is important for sugar. Soils tend to be
water-logged and regional drainage is required. Cultivation techniques
have also to be developed. An unsatisfactory trial run with over-age cane
was held in 1970, but the cane was abandoned because of shortage of funds.
Another area of 350 ha was planted in 1972 to be extended to 1,200 ha for
a further trial in 1973.
D. Conclusion
11.       Enough evidence exists to suggest that large-scale growing of
sugar cane would be feasible outside Java, but further trials and feasibility
studies are necessary to prove this. Feasibility studies, with Terms of
Reference similar to the Appendix to this Annex, are included in the project.

Draft Terms of Reference
Feasibility Studies for Production in New Areas (including Java)
A. Introduction
1.        The objective of the studies is to prepare a program for the
development of technically and economically feasible additional sugar
production in new areas of Indonesia, whether in Java or other sites,
aimed at meeting the internal demand for sugar in Indonesia at the least
cost to its economy; and to make proposals for storage of expected production
over at least the next ten years.
2.        The approximate cost of the studies would be Rp 347 M (US$840,000)
over three years.
B. Background
3.        Indonesian sugar consumption has exceeded production since
1966. The UNDP Indonesian Sugar Study (ISS) was carried out in 1971-72
and prepared a ten-year program for increased production.
4.        The ISS findings in regard to sugar production in new areas
would be a useful starting point for further studies.
C. The Project
5.        The consultants will review all existing data (including that
provided by ISS and the trials being conducted with bilateral aid) on
possible sites for development of new areas, and make a preliminary recon-
naissance thereof.
6.        The consultants will assign priorities for study based on rapid
development possibilities for sugar production and select not more than
five areas where climate, soil, land availability, water and drainage
conditions, and labor availability appear most suitable for sugar produc-
tion.



ANNEX 11
Appendix
Page 2
7.        At the sites selected, the consultants will collect meteorological
information, prepare soil, topographic, water availability and drainage
surveys and install or ensure continuance of variety, fertilizer, and
cultural practice trials.
8.        Within two years of the inception of the project, the consultants
will recommend the two sites they consider most suitable for development
of new sugar production units of at least 4,000 ha with preliminary plans
for, and cost estimates of establishment of these units and prepare a
Project Feasibility Study for each. The studies will be prepared in such
detail and form as to be suitable for appraisal and investment decision by
international sugar companies and international financing agencies that might
be interested in participation.
9.        The studies will include:
(a) rainfall amounts and distribution, sunlight
availability and temperaturs, including diurnal
range;
(b) description of soil and soil analysis of the area
and description of topography, together with a
topographic survey, if needed;
(c) area of land available with terms of acquisition
and length of tenure; statement of opportunity cost
(comparison with other crops);
(d) local availability of labor with wage and fringe
benefit cost estimates;
(e) plans for irrigation, if needed, including method
(Reynoso, furrow, overhead) and availability and
cost of water;
(f) drainage requirements and plans for meeting them;
(g) cultivation practices including field layout, soil
preparation (plowing, etc.) and method (mechanical
or manual), planting and ratooning techniques,
weed, disease and pest control methods and fertilizer
requirements;
(h) varieties for planting, their origin and availability;
and seed nursery technique to ensure rapid propagation
of seed;
(i) yield estimates of cane and sugar per ha, indicating
estimated rendement;



ANNEX 11
Appendix
Page 3
(j) harvesting, loading and cane transport methods, with
cost estimates;
(k) site description and size and specification of fac-
tory, housing and ancillary buildings needed; road,
bridge and port requirements; and any other infra-
structure required including storage requirements; and
(1) future demand for sugar related to expected production,
with and without the proposals made in the studies; the
required capacity and location of storage facilities to
meet the future marketing requirements of sugar in
Indonesia; and proposals for providing additional storage,
if needed, and its cost.
D. Organization and Management
10.       The consultants will provide full-time, as project leader for a
three-year period, a person well qualified in the sugar industry with admin-
istrative ability and experience, and preferably with agronomic or financial
background. They will support him with one assistant, also full-time. In
addition, they would provide such back-up specialist services as they may
specify, estimated to total 24 man-months.
11.       The Government of Indonesia will provide the services of five
graduate agronomists with potential administrative ability and sugar expe-
rience and other staff as required, estimated at 540 man-months.
12.       Government will also provide economic, agricultural, financial
and technical data as required; offices with furnishings and services; and
Government specialist assistance when required.
13.       The consultants will make their own arrangements for accommodation
and transportation but may request Government assistance therewith.

SUGAR PROJECT
Organization and Management
A. General
1.        This Annex is based on the ISS Final Report Chapter 12 and
Appendix E8, ISS Project Preparation Report Chapter 3, the draft report of
managing consultants, SyCip, Gorres, Velayo & Co., IDA experience of
Indonesian agricultural projects and field observation.
2.        Serious management deficiencies hamper the progress of Government-
owned agricultural projects (see Annex 1 for projects being financed by
IDA). They derive largely from cumbersome and inefficient bureaucratic
procedures; concentration in one unit (BCU) of control over enterprises of
many different kinds, growing many different crops; diffusion of management;
inappropriate appointments (often of civil servants with no commercial
experience); and failure to remove ineffective management staff (sometimes
due to lack of suitable alternatives, when so many are required for so
numerous small units). The same deficiencies afflict the sugar industry
and are referred to by ISS as serious.
3.        This by no means implies a general condemnation of existing
management personnel, many of whom are doing a first class job. However,
following a generation of internal disturbances, major changes in Government
policies and industry reorganizations, during all of which contacts with
other sugar cane producing countries were broken or much reduced, there is
a shortage of the essential qualities and experience needed to manage an
industry for which rapid evolution and growth is planned.
4.        The realization of potential technical improvements, implementa-
tion of the project, and subsequent developments in field and factory
depend, above all, on effective management and control, including receptivity
to new ideas, willingness and capacity to experiment, and ability to main-
tain or develop mutually beneficial relationships with workers and cane
farmers. It is important, therefore, to concentrate the best available
management staff where it can be most effectively deployed.
B. Existing Management Structure and Practices
5.        This part of the Annex comprises edited extracts from ISS
Appendix E8.



ANNEX 20

Historical Background
6.        An objective assessment of sugar industry management is difficult
because there have been so many recent organizational changes. The present
system has only been in effect since 1969, and 1970 was rather unfavorable
climatically; so results are not a true reflection of the technical and
financial effectiveness of management in recent years.
7.        ISS studied historical changes in conjunction with results achieved
(Figure A on page 108 of ISS Appendix E8 shows the 1940-1971 trend of pro-
duction and yields). 180 factories operated in Java in 1930, reduced to
85 by 1940. These were managed in groups under several large companies, with
head offices in Holland. The industry achieved its highest technical
competence at this time and led the world in productivity per hectare.
8.        Management was very rigid, and many detailed field an. Xfarory
operations were dictated from head office, working in close conjunction
with a highly efficient research station which had many scientists of world
acclaim on its staff. In spite of the very high yields per hectare, however,
the world recession of the 1930's closed down many factories and some of
the holding companies failed financially and had to be taken over and managed
by banks to which they were indebted.
9.        The Japanese invasion in March 1942 interrupted Dutch operations
and no production records under the Japanese are available. Following the
Japanese surrender, the Indonesians actively opposed the return of the Dutch
and declared their independence unilaterally in August 1945; after much
fighting this was accepted by the Dutch in December 1949. It was only in
the 1950's that normal conditions returned to the industry.  The factories
then remaining in operation were run by 13 Dutch companies and achieved
rapid improvements in yield and sugar content, the latter reaching and
sometimes exceeding prewar levels. Very few Indonesians held managerial
positions and most Pasuruan Research Station staff were Dutch. Rigid
management was again imposed, but labor unrest. and strikes were prevalent
and it was difficult to reach prewar operational standards. The sugar
industry was nationalized in late 1957, and by 1960 all the Dutch management
had departed leaving inexperienced local personnel to manage the industry,
now grouped as 55 factories under the Ministry of Estates.
10.       Managers were at first paid industrial rates and received a bonus
based on factory profitability. Government then decided to pay management
civil service rates without bonus. Substantial salary cuts took place,
leading to acute loss of incentive, the removal of the bonus being particular-
ly discouraging. After nationalization, the industry suffered extreme
financial stringency; and every two to three years, the industry was sub-
jected to reorganization and went through a period of complete bureaucratic
control.



ANNEX 20
Page 3
11.       From 1965 to 1968 the BPU was set up under the Minister of
Estates to provide general management of all Government-owned estates,
including the sugar industry. However, the administration of 55 factories
was too much for one body, so they were divided up under nine Inspectors
who were responsible for control and coordination. They had no direct
authority, however, and all instructions came from the central BPU.
12.       Early in 1968, the Ministry of Estates and the Ministry of Agri-
culture were amalgamated, and in April 1968, PNP were formed for all estates
and plantations. Eight were formed specifically for sugar and more or less
followed the division of the former nine Inspectors. The First Director of
each PNP was nominated by the President of Indonesia and made directly res-
ponsible to the Minister of Agriculture. Many of the First Directors were
chosen from the nine Inspectors. They were responsible for selecting the
other PNP directors from candidates put forward by the Minister of Agricul-
ture.
13.       Shortly after this reorganization, in September 1968, the Minister
of Agriculture set up the BCU in Jakarta to take over PNP administration.
BCU has four Area Representatives controlling and coordinating PNP in their
areas regardless of crop. They have no direct authority but are influential
and expected to represent Government views, which leads to uncertainty of
authority; and though the First Directors remain responsible to the Minister,
they are inevitably sometimes faced with conflicting directives.
14.       BCU staff, being concerned with many plantation crops as well as
sugar, find it extremely difficult to administer effectively such a large
diverse operation. A single body should have responsibility for sugar.
Furthermore, for the industry to fulfill its national obligation and bring
Indonesia back to self-sufficiency, the industry must be operated on a
profit making basis. This profit objective has already been instilled into
PNP; but they often inherited substantial burdens from the past, and their
motivation has been restricted. In addition they still lack authority to
act on their own initiative, and in general there has been little incentive
for directors and management to exert themselves for the benefit of the
industry.
15.       During the latter part of the 1960's, in order to provide an
independent yardstick for assessment of the industry's managerial achieve-
ments, seven factories were given back to "Private Management". Even though
the Minister of Finance remains the major shareholder, the managerial
approach at the "private" factories appears generally more progressive.
16.       Within this overall framework, and the historical background of
change from strict Dutch management to bureaucratic civil service adminis-
tration and a semi-return to an independent profit motivated industry,
the current level of management is reasonable. On the other hand, consider-
ing the recent radical changes in managerial approach that have been develop-
ing outside Indonesia, the Indonesian Sugar Industry, by world standards, is
not managed as well as it might be.

Factory and Field Organization
17.       The PNP management structure is remarkably consistent.  An Admin-
istrator (General Manager) has overall charge of each factory and associated
cane areas, though the holding PNP technical staff officers generally con-
sider themselves responsible for a factory's technical performance and
often participate in the actual control of operations. At least four main
functional senior managers report to the Administrator. The Chief of
Plantations (Agricultural Manager) is clearly responsible for all field
aspects of cane production including harvesting, transport and agronomy.
The Bookkeeper is responsible for accounts and general administration. The
factory itself is divided between two senior managers; the Chief Engineer,
responsible for the actual mill house, boilers, power generators, and
engineering maintenance; and the Chief Chemist responsible for processing
of cane juice and all technical aspects of sugar production.
18.       Neither has overall authority for the factory, and its successful
operation depends on close cooperation between them and the coordination of
the Administrator. It is generally accepted elsewhere, especially with
larger units, that one factory manager, so appointed should have overall
managerial responsibility for factory operation. Since the factory's prime
purpose is to produce sugar, it is preferable for a process manager to be
in complete charge; however, where individual personalities dictate other-
wise, then the chief engineer assumes responsibility. This procedure should
be followed in Indonesia, to ensure proper delegation of responsibility and
uniformity of command.
19.       Apart from harvesting-transport and agronomy, field operations
are not divided functionally but according to specific areas. At the base
of the field management structure is the Headman (Mandur) who is responsible
for 10 to 30 ha. He generally engages his own labor and, under his direction,
all operations from land preparation, irrigation, planting, right up to
harvesting are carried out. The Headman is responsible to a Section Manager
(Sinder) who is responsible for between 100 and 150 ha, thus having between
five and ten headmen under him.
20.       The Section Manager in turn, along with three to four others, is
responsible to an Assistant Agricultural Manager. Between one and three
Assistant Managers are each normally responsible for between 500 and 750 ha;
though in some sugar factories, he may be responsible for as much as 2,000 ha.
The Agricultural Manager is thus able to delegate all direct field operations
to his Assistant Managers.  He also has reporting to him the Agronomist and
the Transport/Harvesting Manager.  The former is responsible for research
field trials laid down by the PNP agronomist, in conjunction with the Pasuruan
Research Station. The Harvesting/Transport Manager has between four and
five Harvesting Supervisors, and usually two Railtrack Supervisors. He also
coordinates cane farmers' deliveries by providing a daily quota of rail trucks
each day onto which farmers load their cane. The Harvesting/Transport Manager
is responsible for laying down portable track ahead of harvesting. In the
off crop season he is responsible for maintenance of the permanent way. (The
Transport Workshop also comes under the Transport Manager (at most factories),
or under the Chief Engineer.)



ANNEX 20

Management Progression
21.       Management progression and promotion are slow, an inheritance from
the Dutch system under which the most senior employees served a long time in
junior positions, regardless of their scientific qualifications. The field
worker can become an assistant Headman and, after organizing his own supply
of workers, a Headman. He usually has little formal training, and recruits
and employs people from his own village, depending on the work available
and agreed to by the Section Manager.
22.       After up to five years, the Headman can become Chief Headman and
assist the Section Manager. An exceptional Chief Headman can become Section
Manager, though most are promoted from Harvesting Supervisor, the latter
generally having a higher level of primary education. Alternatively the
Agronomist may become a Section Manager in the course of his progression.
From Assistant Section Manager, responsible for 80 to 100 ha of cane, and
then to Section Manager with between 100 and 150 ha, promotion is either to
Harvest/Transport Manager or to Assistant Agricultural Manager. This usually
takes three to five years.
23.       Young men with higher education, after studying tropical agriculture,
start working as chemists in the factory and are responsible for supervising
processing on shift work for two to five years before being promoted to Chief
Chemist. After two or more years in this position, the potential senior is
expected to change career and become agronomist for up to three years of
detailed work in the field. He then progresses to Section Manager for a
further three to five years before becoming Assistant Agricultural Manager
for a further two or three. Thus, having first received a very thorough
grounding in the factory, the potential Senior Manager spends many years in
the field before progressing to higher overall responsibility.
Need for Specialization
24.       With the present trend of sugar industry technology and speciali-
zation, it is almost impossible for one man to assimilate sufficient tech-
nical expertise in such diverse fields as sugar processing and tropical
agriculture, and more specialization must be introduced. Future General
Managers can be selected either from field or factory, or even outside the
industry, primarily for their ability to manage; they can then receive
enough specialized training to assimilate any additional modules of knowledge
and experience in sugar technology, engineering, agriculture and general
administration, they may require as general managers.
25.       Under the current system, the manager with the least experience -
the Chemist - has charge of the most important operation - recovering sugar
from cane juice using highly sophisticated techniques and equipment. The
position of Process Overseer (Shift Chemist) should carry even greater
responsibilities, and men with a high level of technical training and
experience will be required.



ANNEX 20
Page 6
26.       On the agricultural side, the advance in technology will soon
require more specialized personnel, and the need for a more functional
organization, e.g. in irrigation and drainage, can already be seen. With
poor irrigation, reported almost universally throughout the industry, it
is essential that specialist irrigation agricultural engineers be brought
into the management structure at an early date. In addition, higher caliber
agronomists, with detailed technical training, are required effectively to
implement new agricultural techniques.
27.       At the moment the factories are very small by world standards,
producing only between 10,000 and 20,000 tons of sugar per annum from 1,000
to 2,000 ha of cane. Such small units cannot carry the technical staff and
management required under modern conditions. With expansion and amalgamation
of production units, it would be possible to employ better qualified staff.
28.       In other cane sugar producing countries Section Managers control
up to 800 ha of irrigated cane. However, bearing in mind the dispersed
nature of Java cane areas (up to six times the normal area expected under
single blocks of monoculture cane), it should be expected that Section
Managers of suitable caliber might control 300 ha or more, especially if
irrigation and mechanization are managed on a functional basis.
Personnel Management
29.       A noticeable absence from the present system is a "Personnel
Department", now so often a major feature in other sugar industries. Leav-
ing the Headman to find his own workers has obviously been effective in the
past, but should a shortage of "willing" labor develop it will become very
difficult for the Headman to insist on high work standards.
Labor Administration
30.       The administration of labor payments, whereby the Headman contracts
a price for each job with the Section Manager, is also open to considerable
abuse. Though, in theory, wage rates are quoted at a very low figure, far
fewer workers may be actually doing the work though sharing the overall
wages between them, with the connivance of the Headman, because nobody
other than the Headman has control of the number of people actually employed
on the job. Malpractices can therefore easily occur, and could lead to
considerable industrial strife. An alternative approach wouild be for the
factories to have formal and open agreements with labor contractors.
31.       A key factor in tropical agriculture is timeliness and much im-
provement could be effected by insisting that headmen employ sufficient
labor; alternatively the factory could recruit labor directly to carry out
operations on time. This particularly applies to land preparation where
often up to two months of growing time is lost due to short working. As
more sophisticated agricultural techniques are developed, so the importance
of timeliness of operations will increase in proportion.



ANNEX 20
Page 7
Present Management
32.       The Indonesian sugar industry's overall objective is "to make
Indonesia self sufficient in sugar within the next ten years at the least
cost to its economy". Yet many senior managers are completely unaware of
the availability of land that could be leased nearby, even though they are
operating for shorter crops than are economically and technically desirable.
Obviously the need for increased production has not been communicated to
them.
33.       It is also important that senior managers be given clear overall
objectives. If the industry is to be managed efficiently, these objectives
should be clearly defined, regularly reviewed, and actively communicated
to all levels of management. Without this first step managers cannot
operate properly.
34.       Management motivation should be reviewed.  Salaries appear low,
though tax is paid by the PUP and a bonus system has been recently introduced.
Payment of the bonus, however, is provisional on PNP payment of its full
government taxes and, with further delays in authorization in Jakarta,
payments become far removed in time from past achievements. Management
should be paid promptly according to results, for which targets should be
predetermined and agreed mutually, well in advance. Results should also
be measured in relative, not absolute, terms so that improvements are
rewarded and staff at factories with exceptionally good conditions are not
unduly favored.
Records
35.       The industry is severely handicapped by excessive paperwork,
demanded in the attempt to control the industry. The Dutch system of
autocratic, and often remote, management led to the development of an
enormous volume of data being recorded and submitted to controlling offices.
36.       As circumstances changed or as problems occurred, requiring
information to effect corrective action, so the quantity of returns has
built up over many years. As each calamity was overcome, no critical
reappraisal and reduction of information was demanded of lower management.
An attempt must be made to provide management with only the minimum mean-
ingful data needed to control the industry, so that time can be given to
the more important aspects of progressive management - forecasting, planning
and on-the-spot visits to create team work and work-force motivation.
37.       At the moment, in spite of the many returns, the essential measure-
ment of financial results against estimates and against other units is not
adequately made.
Conclusion
38.       The industry is operating under a management regime of "safe
mediocrity" and, with a few exceptions, there is no spirit of self



ANNEX 20
Page 8
motivation. Very few managers use their reserves of dedication and effort
and there is no atmosphere of creative energy. Though many staff are
knowledgeable and keen, little attempt is made to introduce innovations
or take calculated risks. Nobody is prepared to risk making a mistake, so
nothing is ventured and nothing gained.
39.       Performance standards are either lacking or set low, except in
respect of factory down time, which management is obsessed to avoid at all
costs, in spite of reduced crop. The machinery is generally very old and
needs to be treated with care to avoid breakages as a result of metal
fatigue. Spare parts are difficult to obtain, due to obsolescence, and
they are expensive. Also, whenever there is a major factory breakdown there
is invariably a police court of enquiry to determine whether the cause was
sabotage, and this is a very time consuming and demoralizing experience for
all factory senior management. Because of this, no attempts are made to
put machinery under stress to increase throughput.
40.       ISS was on the lookout for divergencies of practice and innova-
tions, to obtain indications of the effects that change would have in the
future and to evaluate existing alternatives. Divergencies in systems of
cultivation, alternative methods of irrigation, lengths of ratooning were
particularly sought. It was very disappointed to find that alternatives
were singularly absent and the industry is virtually devoid of innovation
and initiative.
41.       This does not reflect well on either the organization or the
management of the sugar industry, and a complete structural review is
required. It is also essential to change to a profit motivated system
whereby management can be rewarded according to the clearly measured results
that they achieve.
C. Structural Organisation
42.       For the internal structure of the industry, the essential problem
is to find the right balance of central co-ordination and delegated
initiative and responsibility. At present nearly all the factories,
being in the Government sector, come under the central control of BCU,
exercised through PNP. More decentralisation of Government enterprises
through conversion into larger, more independent units, is approved
and desirable Government policy. The managements of such units, even
when wholly owned by Government, would have a greater sense of initiative
and cost consciousness than is normal in Government enterprises controlled
by the Civil Service. This view is supported by the higher production,
longer crops, and generally lower costs achieved by independent sugar
industries in other countries7and, formerly, in Indonesia. At the same
time it is very doubtful whether a simple conversion of each PNP into a
more independent unit, or PT, would produce an adequate result.



ANNEX 20
Page 9
43.       A major objection to such a conversion is that there would be a
continuing need, at least during the development period, for central co-
ordination of a number of activities of common concern to the component parts
of the industry. These include long-range planning, particularly the
planning and control of major capital development, including substantial
rehabilitation of production units and the development of additional cane
land, of which the project is only a first phase; exchange of technical
experience between units; budgetary and financial control and comparison;
raising of funds; research and effective application of its results;
training and especially post-experience training. Subsidiary to that
basic need is the desirability of coordination and consolidation of procure-
ment for factory and other equipment to ensure competitive quotations, a
high degree of interchangeability, and satisfactory quality standards.
44.       A second objection is that the PNP are hardly large enough, under
modern conditions, to serve as high level operational units. Experience
elsewhere demonstrates the advantage of having available a small central
group of first class administrators, technologists and scientists, available
to advise a number of units to a coordinated plan. Average PNP production
from as many as eight factories is less than 100,000 tons of sugar per annum,
little more than the output of a single modern factory. A more appropriate
"group" output norm would be at least 250,000 tons.  Even allowing for
planned substantial increase of output from existing units, as a result of
yield increases and extension of cane areas, the average PNP, as now consti-
tuted, would fall considerably short of this norm.
45.       Other considerations bear on the general structure.  The coordina-
tion of the industry's needs, through larger independent units, would
provide valuable additional opportunities for experimentation and for
demonstration of new techniques. There would also be the need to look to,
and coordinate, the development of wholly new areas, possibly with the
help of foreign capital and technical expertise, which are more likely to
be attracted to units created quite separately for specific enterprises.
At the same time, Government would wish to participate, and could do so
with a better prospect of an understanding of the needs of the industry and
of cross fertilisation of new ideas, if this participation were channeled
through a central coordinating body.
Proposed Reorganization
46.       For the existing industry, especially with rehabilitation and
extensions planned, there is need for overall coordination and a controlling
body concerned only with sugar, without the distraction of other crops -
which is a defect of the present attempt at control by BCU - and for con-
solidation of existing PNP into fewer, stronger units. ISS suggested a
sugar production authority, constituted as a corporation, with up to four
subsidiary units (PT) each responsible for a group of factories and event-
ually including all present PNP. SyCip, Gorres, Velayo, management con-
sultants hired by GOI to make recommendations for management of the Govern-
ment-owned estate sector, suggested a regrouping of sugar factories into
Divisions under two autonomous regional PT with a Service PT owned jointly,



ANNEX 20
Page 10
to provide common services such as procurement, research, management, per-
sonnel and legal advice and marketing. The Ministry of Agriculture would
decide upon and enforce national policy for the industry and the Ministry
of Finance would appoint PT directors and monitor performance.
47.       Government considered a proposal, made during appraisal, for the
creation of a wholly Government-owned policy-making and controlling sugar
corporation, with up to four subsidiary operating PT, but has since expressed
a preference for four operating PT to be formed without a controlling or
holding corporation. Factories for immediate rehabilitation, at least, would
be transferred to these PT by January 1, 1973; the remainder to follow as
soon as possible. The PT would be further consolidated into two within a
reasonable period of time.
48.       A coordinating Standing Committee for Sugar (SCS) would be created
in Jakarta as an inter-Departmental Committee, with a permanent secretariat.
It would be responsible for long-range planning and general policy, including
coordination and decision on major capital expenditure inside and outside
Java; reconstructions and amalgamations, including the creatlon of the new
PT; marketing and pricing policy, including imports and exports.  It would
also be responsible for legislation concerning the industryl and matters
affecting the industry which are the concern of other Government Departments
such as irrigation and drainage and rents charged for sugar lands.  Functions
would be as outlined in para 2 of the Appendix to this Annex.
49.       PT would be responsible for organizing the factories within. their
control, grouped geographically but with emphasis on day to day management
being at factory level. Functions would be similar to those outlined in
para 3 of the Appendix to this Annex and would include:  preparation and
submission to their respective Supervisory Boards of proposals for major
capital expenditure; arrangement of short-term. borrowing; determination of
production targets; approval of factory capital and operaz ing budgets;
monitoring and comparing factory performance (includiing comparison with other
PT through NCS); budgetary and financial control; accounting and financial
procedures; and coordination of field research with the Pasuruan Research
Station.
Joint Sugar Projects Unit
50.       The PT would need to cooperate on a number of matters.  Most
important, for the project, is the orderly coordination of rehabilitation,
the hiring and servicing of consujltants anTd organization of procurement.
Also important is the organiization of management advisory consultants for
the four PT, which could be provided by one or more firms or by individuals
directly recruited. The sugar PT would therefore, as they are created,
assume the obligations of an agreement (Joint Agreement) to be entered into
immediately by the sugar PNP for the establishment, staffing and financing of a
Joint Sugar Projects Unit under a Director who would coordinate all factory
rehabilitation and organize: consultantst contracts, housing, passages,
transportation, and payments; bulking of items for procurement, issuing and
approval of bids; exchange of technical information; and other matters of



ANNEX 20
Page 11
joint concern. The Unit would be located in Surabaya, which is nearest to
most of the sugar factories.
51.       The Unit would employ a consulting firm to provide Engineering Services
that would assist with planning and execution of the rehabilitation, and to
hire design engineering consultants, as needed, for specific factory design
and supervision. The consulting firm would work to a program agreed by the
Joint Sugar Projects Unit and would report to the Director of that Unit for
administrative purposes and to the First Directors of the PT concerned for
rehabilitation work. Details of these Engineering Services are in Annex 9.
52.       Such an organisation is designed to avoid, at the one extreme,
detailed and bureaucratic rigidities; and at the other the complete indepen-
dence of a large number of small units, with consequential dispersal of
capital and management resources in small scale developments and without
the prospect of realising the very large potential economies of larger
operating units.
53.       Completely new developments, a?ether in Java or elsewhere in
Indonesia, would probably best be undertaken by new units (PT) independent
of the main operating groups, possibly with external private participation
from the start, but with a controlling interest retained by GOI in any
event.
54.       On the basis of these principles, the functions of the component
parts of the structure would be as outlined in the Appendix to this Annex.
D. Control and Management
55.       Each PT would have a Supervisory Board, preferably with three members
common to them all; a chairman, who would be a competent and experienced
administrator, not necessarily experienced in the sugar industry, but conversant
with Government wishes and with access to the latest technical developments;
a member with high caliber experience in financial administration of commercial
enterprises; and a member experienced in the sugar industry. None would be
concurrently directors of PT Executive Management Boards.
56.       The PT would each have five-man Executive Management Boards com-
prising a First Director, who would be the chief executive, a Field Produc-
tion, a Factory Production, a Financial and a Comptroller Director,
selected from existing PNP directors on the basis of their competence and
experience in the industry. The First Directors, in particular, would be
chosen for their administrative ability and willingness to adopt new techniques.
These Boards would be slightly different from the normal PNP/PT in composition
in that there would be two Production Directors instead of only one; and instead
of a Commercial Director, the Financial Director would be responsible for
financial, and budgetary matters, and the Comptroller would be responsible for
accounting nd cost control. The directors would be responsible, through
their First Director, to the Supervisory Boards for overall planning of the



ANNEX 20
Page  12
production units under their control and other functions described in para
3 of the Appendix to this Annex; and they would attempt to raise the per-
formance of the weaker units.
57.       Assisted by consultants provided under the project, PT would
introduce new techniques in factory and field, and liaise with the Pasuruan
Research Station in the introduction oL improved planting material and field
production techniques.  The PT Management Board, particularly the Production
Directors, would frequently visit the units under their control and assist
the Inspection Service, appointed by SCS, in monitoring and improving
performance.
58.       At unit (factory) level, mana-ement would. be organised on a
functional basis under a General             lie would preferably have attended
the Acadeny of Plantations and Estates at JogJakarta and have spent several
years as a chief chemist or chief engineer, and have some knowledge of
field operations.  He would be selected for his aptitude for management and,.
if necessary, would have received training for the post to give him know-
ledge of sugar cane culture, financia:' cotrol and personnel management.
59.       The Factory Manager would be responsible for ail. aspects of
processing, mechanical and chemical. Hie also would al'so, preferably, have
attended t,Le Academy and would have detailed knowledge either of sugar
chemistry or of sugar production engineering.  He would have received
training also in general engineering, steam and electrical generation and
use, transport operation and maintenance, sugar laboratory technology,
and quality control, budgetary control and personnel management; and he
would have a general knowledge of the principles of cane agriculture, civil
engineering, building construction and industrial safety.  He would have
the following senior staff responsible to h.iv chief engineer; chief chemist
and process manager; electrical engineer; and technical stores controller.
60.       The Agricultural Manager woil.d be responsible for all aspects
of field work, including irrigation and drainage, cane nursery management,
planting, harvesting and cane transportation, and farmers' cane supply.  He
would have detailed knowledge of sugar agronomy and have received training
in. plant physiology; water duty; pests, disease and weed control; fertilizer
response; and agricultural engineering. He would have the following senior
staff responsible to him: agricultural (irrigation) engineer; agronomist;
transport manager; field manager; cane farmiers' extension officer. He would
have a number of assistants in these categories.
61.       The Business Manager would be basically an accountant, responsible
for all legal and commercial matters, record keeping, cost information and
control of funds. He would also be responsible for the movement of
sugar stocks and, if free market conditions returned, for marketing. He
would have responsible to him: a senior accountant; a cost accountant; an
executive assistant; and a sugar storekeeper.



ANNEX 20

62.       SCS composition would be:  the Director-General of Estates (chairman);
a representative each of the Ministries of Agriculture, Finance, Home Affairs
and Trade; and representatives of BAPPENAS, the Bank of Indonesia and BULOG.
SCS would have a permanent secretariat the head of which would be conversant
with Government procedures but aware of the needs of commercial enterprise.
He would be responsible for seeing that the policy laid down by SCS was
carried out.

Guidelines for Independent Auditors
1.        The independent auditors should submit both sfhort-form and long-
form reports.
2.        These reports should be addressed to the Chairman of the Supervisory
Board of Directors and not to any member of the PT management.
3.        The following is an example short-form report:
"We have examined the balance sheet of PT -- as of
December 31, 19--, and the profit and loss account
and related statements for the year then ended.
"Our examination was made in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included
such tests of the accounting records, verification of
assets and liabilities, and such other auditing procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
"In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements and
appended notes present fairly the financial position of
the PT at December 31, 19--, and the results of its
operations for the year then ended, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles, applied on a
basis consistent in all material respects with that of
the previous year."
4.        When a qualified opinion is offered by the auditors, the opinion
paragraph of short-form report should be modified in such a way as to
make clear the nature of the qualification. It should refer specifically
to the subject of the qualification and of the effect on the financial
position and results of operations, if reasonably determinable.
5.        Generally accepted auditing standards include, in addition to
adherence to accounting principles which are generally accepted, standards
of preparation, standards of field records, standards of supervision, review,
reporting and disclosure. The scope of the auditors' examination should be
sufficient to enable him to express the opinion described above. All of
these standards are well-known to public accountants.
6.        In case generally accepted auditing standards could not be
followed, the auditors should expressly state so, indicating specifically



ANNEX 21

the circumstara,es  WThere there is a failure to observe these standards, the
auditors should refrain from making an overall opinion of the financial
statements subr4tted
7.        Verification of assets and liabilities should cover:
(a) cash and bank balances;
(b) inventories and produce stocks; and
(c) fixed assets - vehicles; field, factory and office equipment.
Verification should include physical and test checks; examination of records
and expenditure; and obtaining of certificates independently from banks and
other custodians of assets, contractors, suppliers, and other debtors and
creditors.
8.        The long-form report is an extension of the short-form report.
Appropriate details (analyses, summaries, explanations and comments) of
items in the various certified financial statements should be included in
the long-form report.
9.        Certified statements would include:
(a) a balance sheet for the whole PT;
'b) consolidated profit and loss account for the PT;
(c)  profit and loss statement for each factory or other unit
f(e.g. Research Station);
(d) sources and application of funds;
(e) fixed assets showing additions, disposals, depreciation
and balance sheet values;
(f)  non-recurring expenses;
(g)  miscelleneous income and expenditure; and
(h) age classification of debtors and creditors.
All statements should, when practicable, show comparative figures for the
preceding years.
10.       Conmments and recommendations in the long-form report would include:
(a) implementation of recommendations made in previous year;
(b) management and organization;
(c) btudgetary control;



ANNEX 21
Page 3
(d) financial and field controls;
(e) payroll, procurement and sales procedures;
(f) inventory control and stock levels;
(g) adherence to public accounting standards;
(h) efficacy of the internal audit procedures; and
(i) events after the date of the balance sheet significantly
affecting the financial position of the PT.

SUGAR PROJECT
Impact on the Economy and Economic Rate of Return
A.  Project's Economic Potential
Introduction
1.        The economic rate of return from the proposed investment would
be about 26% as shown in Table 1, based on assumptions described in paras 14 and
18 below. In addition to this satisfactory return, the project would
make a significant impact on the country's balance of payments and on income
distribution.
Balance of Payments
2.        Indonesia imports both rice and sugar; and though rice self-
sufficiency is planned within four or five years, the sugar deficit, even
with the project, is expected to continue until about 1980. 1/ Incremental
project production would reduce annual sugar imports by 190,000 tons by 1978,
resulting in net annual foreign exchange saving of about US$41 M, a significant
saving, particularly since Indonesia pays for sugar imports from its own
foreign exchange earnings and not from food aid programs, as has been the
case for part of the cereal imports.
3.        Moreover, based on an economic cost-benefit comparison between
domestic production of rice against imported rice and domestic sugar
production against imported sugar, the economy would save about Rp 100,000
(US$240) per ha by opting to grow sugarcane and import rice (Table 2).
In this comparison, production inputs are calculated at market prices.
These include on-farm production cost, transportation and processing. In
the case of rice, the subsidy provided by the Government is also considered
as a cost to the economy. The cost of unskilled farm labor has been
calculated at an average rate of Rp 60 and Rp 85/person/day respectively for
rice (private farmer) and sugarcane cultivation (under factory management).
Although both these crops require a large number of unskilled farm laborers
for their cultivation, their peak requirements for labor differ; furthermore
harvesting, which causes peak labor requirement for rice, is usually done by
1/ Primarily because of the time needed for organizational improvements
required to modernize and expand the sugar industry, such as improvement
of cane varieties, selection of optimum location of new factories,
organizing of cane farmers, and for the mobilization of capital to effect
these improvements.

women whereas sugarcane harvesting is done by men. Thus sugarcane cultivation
does not create or aggravate a labor shortage.
4.        Average 1971/72 world free market prices have been used to
calculate the cost of imported rice and imported sugar (Table 2). With
projected 1900 I4ort prices for sugar (rice remaining the same), the net
benefit to tbe esunomy from sugarcane cultivation would increase from Rp
100,000 to about Rp 164,000 per ha, an increase of about 56%. Thus sugarcane
cultivation is, and will continue to be, more profitable to the economy
than rice.  This is due to Indonesia's natural advantages in sugarcane culti-
vation over other international sugarcane producers and the existing and
expected future high prices in the world market for sugar, compared to those
for rice.
Farmerts Income from Land Rent
5.        Sugarcane is grown by sugar factories on land leased from a
large number of small farmers. At present, about 24,000 ha, involving
about 48,000 families, are so leased in the project area. Land rent is
determined annually by Government on the basis of the opportunity cost of
the land. Provincial and district offIces of the Dinas Pertanian (a branch
of Ministry of Agriculture) regularly collect detailed data on yield, pro-
duction cost (including wages), farmgate and market prices etc., broken down
by type of land (irrigated and non-irrigated), by crops and by area. Based
on this data, the opportunity cost of the land is calculated, assuming the
basic cropping pattern followed by the majority of farmers, which in the
project area, is typically one crop each of rice (non-irrigated), maize and
soybeans in 12 months. In these calculations, family labor is computed at
the existing market rates of Rp 60/day/person. Such calculations serve as
a basis for negotiation between representatisves of the Ministry of Agriculture,
provincial and local government, farmers and sugar factories. The agreed
figure is placed before the Ministry of Home Affairs, which then officially
promulgates the basic land rent to which various standard premiums may be
added.
6.        Average present land rent (Rp 100,000/ha with premiums in 1972)
appears to be less than annual net income from rice/maize/soybean (Rp 112,000/
ha using average 1971/72 farmgate prices). However, the relative value of two
alternatives is changed significantly if income from crops is discounted at
25% per anaw, (the probable minimum cost of capital for farmers in the project
area).  Furtbe mere, farmers renting their land avoid losses from cultivation
risks and many of them would obtain seasonal employment, thus further in-
creasing their income. Nevertheless, land rent policy needs to be flexible
to ensure sufficient cane supply to factories and reflect changes, such as
increases in t'ne opportunity cost of land, and other factors (see Annex 7).
The objective of land rent policy should be to provide adequate financial
incentives for farmers to lease their land to factories, while allowing
sufficient financial incentives for those farmers wishing to cultivate their
own sugarcane. To assist the Government in deciding land rent policy, a
cane supply survey team would advise SCS from time to time (Annex 7). Project
forecasts assume land rent will include premiums and will be increased by 10%



ANNEX 23
Page 3
to reflect the future opportunity cost of land. This is shown by financial
and economic rates of return to be feasible for both factories and the
economy.
7.        Thus, the project, by increasing the processing capacity of
the sugar factories, which has been a limiting factor in the past, would
enable about 30,000 additional farmers to participate (involving about 15,000
ha) and assist them in increasing their income by 10%.
Farmers' Income from Sugarcane Cultivation
8.        For small farmers, sugarcane farming is at present marginally more
profitable than the alternative crops (rice, soybeans and maize) now generally
cultivated, with production inputs, including family labor, calculated at
existing market rates in the project area. For example, individual farmers
cultivating rice or sugarcane pay about Rp 60/day/person for hired help
(unskilled). At present, however, few small farmers are able to undertake
sugarcane farming because it requires a substantial amount of working capital
as well as living expenses during the time it takes cane to grow to maturity
(about 10 months). Inadequate processing capacity of sugar factories has
also, to some extent, discouraged farmers from undertaking sugarcane cultiva-
tion. Under the project, provision has been made for such credit, together
with technical assistance to small farmers.
9.        It is expected that at full development (1978) about 3,000 addition-
al hectares involving about 5,000 farm families, would switch to sugarcane
cultivation from other crops, which would result in a net increase of income
of about Rp 35,000 per year per family, or about 60% over present income
Moreover, those farmers already growing sugarcane (about 4,000) in the
project area, would increase their incomes by about 55% (Rp 60,000 to Rp 90,000)
due to project induced improvements. Such a development would assist the
Government to some extent in achieving its objective of increasing the income
of small farmers.
10.       Sugarcane cultivation at full development would be more profitable
for small farmers than either renting land or growing other crops as shown
in the table below:

/1   Assume farmgate rice prices decline by 5Z.
However, to organize small farmers for sugarcane cultivation (averaging about
0.5 ha each) requires organizational (cane collection and extension services),
financial (credit), and educational changes which take time to bring about.
Furthermore, there are risks in cane farming; e.g., weather, pests, diseases,
especially for farmers not accustomed to it. In view of these uncertainties,
smallholder cane farming is being introduced on a modest scale. The next
phase of sugar industry modernization/expansion would take account of the
experience of this effort in deciding how far to encourage small farmers
to undertake further sugarcane cultivation.
Consumer Prices
11.       Sugar is a major food item in Indonesia for rich and poor alike.
Inadequate domestic production and insufficient imports (Annex 4, para 21)
limit supply and enable speculators to increase retail prices of sugar,
creating social tension. The project, by inicreasing production and improving
marketing (Annex 4) would contribute to stabilization of retail prices and
would thus assist Government in meeting its social objectives.
Employment
12.       The project would create about 80,000 seasonal jobs in the sugar
industry (of 4 to 5 months' duration) and would thus provide employment
opportunities to farm families that had rented their land to the sugar
factories as a result of the project.
13.       The extent of the impact of the project on the economy confirms
its high priority, in line with the Government's strategy for agricultural
development.



ANNEX 23

B. Economic Rate of Return Assumptions
Cost
14.       For rate of return purposes, the opportunity costs of land under
sugarcane cultivation has been taken at its current rental value of Rp 100,000
per ha.
Labor
15.       Unskilled labor is available in the project area and has been
calculated at the basic rate of Rp 85/day, per person, reflecting the
economic opportunity cost of labor in that area.
investment Cost
16.       Investment costs, including contingencies, are as in Annex 12, except
that management advisory services are apportioned between project and other
factories, and 30% of research costs and none of the feasibility study costs
are attributed to project production.
Imported Rice
17.       As a result of the project, some land now under rice would be
used for sugarcane, necessitating additional rice imports. The cost of
these imports has been included at international (cif) rice prices, after
taking into account domestic production and processing cost and subsidies
provided by the Government.
Benefits
18.       Incremental white sugar production, 50% carried forward to
allow for timelag due to possible delays, has been valued at the imported
price, cif Indonesia. Incremental molasses production which would be
exported, has been calculated at the rate of US$14/ton, fob Indonesian
port.
Economic Rate of Return
19.       Based on these estimates, the project would provide an economic
rate of return of about 26% (Table 1). This return is high, partly because
rehabilitation substantially improves the effectiveness of, and hence the
return from, existing installations, but also because of the high cost of
imported sugar which is saved by the project.
Sensitivity Tests
20.       A number of sensitivity tests have been made, which support the
validity of the project. The results are summarized below:



ANNEX 23
Page 6
Economic Rate of Return
in Percent
(a) One year delay in implementation with
increasing sugar import cost and no
change in benefits                                         16
(b) Doubling the labor cost without
increasing the productivity                                18
(c) 10% decrease in the world free market
prices of sugar                                            20
(d)  10% increase in the world free market
prices of sugar                                            32
(e)  10% increase in capital cost                               24
(f) Reduction in no. of days of factory operation:
(i)  From 180 to 160 days                                  19
(ii)  From 180 to 140 days                                  12
Risks
21.       There are four major risks which may adversely affect the project
(a) sufficient additional land may not be available;
(b) processing facilities may not operate as efficiently
as assumed;
(c) sugar prices may decline; and
(d)  organizational and administrative problems may arise.
However, in view of the fact that farmers would financially benefit from
renting their land to sugar factories, it is highly improbable that additional
land would not become readily available. Moreover, since sugarcane cultivation
would be beneficial to the economy, it is very probable that the Government
would encourage the farmers to lease their land to sugar factories, by
higher rents if necessary. With regard to processing efficiency, Indonesians
have considerable experience in operating sugarcane factories and would
hire consultants under the project to improve performance, which lessens this
risk considerably. Based on an international demand/supply analysis, and
on recent trends, the present world shortage of sugar seems likely to continue
for some time, and would keep sugar prices high. Organization and administration
is the most vulnerable area. However under the project, measures have been
taken to improve this, and since the project is beneficial to both the economy
and the farmers, Government has strong incentive to ensure project success.

Conclusion
22.       The risk of the project not achieving the forecast benefits is
low. Even with a lesser economic rate of return, the impact of the project
on the economy would remain substantial.
