A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
The Health Reform Program seeks to support the Government to implement a long-term
health restructuring strategy. It is based on the Government's Letter of Development Program
(Annex 3), which addresses key elements of the health policy agenda defined in the Health of the
Nation State Program, approved by Parliament and the President on November 16, 1998. An
Adaptable Program Loan (APL) is believed to be the appropriate instrument to use for this rapidly
developing transition economy since it provides flexibility on the one hand and assures consistency
of policies on the other. In addition, it provides the opportunity to adapt to evolving priorities within
the agreed framework of the overall program and to adjust at the end of each phase, based on the
practical experience of that phase. The program will encompass three parts phased over eight years
that will seek to support the implementation of the program nationwide. The first phase, which is
described in this document will have an implementation period of four years.
The purpose of the program is to achieve a health system where health care providers are
rewarded for quality and efficiency; patients select their own primary health care doctor of choice;
health services are provided by restructured financing mechanisms to support cost-efficient outpatient
care and payments based on services provided; and continuous progress is made on priority health
status targets. Progress towards these objectives will contribute to the improved welfare of the
Kazakhstan population as measured by gains in health status and public satisfaction with the health
system. The development objectives for Phase I (current project) are regional and national in scope.
The Project is part of the Health Program, the objective of which is to achieve a sustainable
performance-oriented health system, through: (a) modernization and improvement of the quality and
efficiency of the health care system at the national level; and (b) (i) implementation of integrated
health reform; (ii) strengthening of the quality and cost effectiveness of primary health care (PHC);
and (iii) improvement of financing and management capacity at service delivery level in East
Kazakhstan and Almaty oblasts. See Annex IA for a complete list of objectives, inputs and
indicators.
At the oblast level, Phase I would be implemented in East Kazakhstan Oblast (283,300 km2,
population: 1.64 million) and Almaty Oblast (224,200 km2, population: 1.66 million. Oblasts were
selected by the government for their diversity, experience with health reform; willingness and
readiness of local providers to reform; and strength of leadership in the oblast. Oblasts differ in size,
economic base, health conditions and status, and population composition. Lessons from the
implementation of the oblast level components will help guide the Government's efforts to strengthen
primary health care services and financial and management in the country at large with support from
Phases II and III of the program. An outline of activities to be included in Phases I, II, and III of the
Health Reform Program is included in Annex lB. Passage from Phase I to II and from II to III
would be determined on the basis of analyses by the Borrower and the Bank of implementation
performance. Trigger indicators for Phase II of the APL are presented in Annex IC.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
The joint IBRD/IFC CAS document number: 16989-KZ was discussed by the Board of
Directors on August 26, 1997. The main objectives of the CAS focus on maintaining macro-
economic stability, completing the transition to a market economy, strengthening social services,
mitigating the impact of transition, and transforming the role of the Government. The CAS outlines
five specific strategy actions for the health sector in Kazakhstan: (i) improve the efficiency of health
Page 2



care provision focusing on reorientation of the service towards outpatient based primary health care,
redefine services to be provided by the state, rationalize facilities; (ii) redefine governmental role in
the health sector from direct provision to management and policy development; (iii) increase role of
non-govermmental sector in delivering health services; (iv) establish sustainable and predictable
sources of financing; and (v) update, modernize the clinical information base.
The program addresses and supports these actions for the health sector through the
reorientation to primary care; rehabilitation and equipping of ambulatory Primary Health Care
Centers; restructuring of financing mechanisms to support cost-efficient outpatient care and payments
based on services provided; rationalization of secondary level facilities; introduction of new treatment
protocols; promotion of decentralized services and diversity of providers; and strengthening of the
clinical information infrastructure.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
A Health Sector Note prepared by the Bank was discussed with the Government in February
1997. The note identified the following issues for the sector, which are still relevant to date:
Declining Health Status. In terms of basic health indicators, Kazakhstan lies somewhere
between established market economies and middle income countries. Infant and adult mortality rates
and life expectancy are all better than in middle income economies, such as Turkey with comparable
or higher levels of per capita income. The main concern has been that basic health indicators have
deteriorated in recent years. Life expectancy is dropping and in 1997 was only 70.0 for women and
58.5 for men, compared to an average of 73.1 for women and 63.8 for men during 1992 to 1997.
From 1990 to 1994 a slight increase in infant mortality was observed, from 26.4 to 27.4 per 1000
newborns (9.4 for OECD countries). However, in 1997 it has dropped to 24.2. The infant mortality
rate is variable -- a rate of 44.7 was recorded for one small community outside Almaty in 1993.
Maternal mortality is high by international standards. During 1991-1997 the rate has ranged from
67.2 to 76.9 per 100,000 live births, that is 9.5 times than the corresponding indicator in the US (8.0),
but lower than in India and Turkey.
The reasons are complicated by the relationship between access to health care and
predisposing maternal diseases such as anemia or hepatitis. A 1995 household survey suggested that
49 percent of all women suffered from some degree of anemia. According to the State Program,
during the last five years, the frequency of anemia cases in pregnant women increased by 1.5 times,
while the frequency of diseases of the kidneys increased by 1.3 times, cardiovascular diseases by 1.2
times and genital diseases by 1.7 times. In addition, there has been some claim that a high number on
maternal mortality stem from complications related to abortions (some 250,000 abortions were
recorded in 1994). The TB situation has deteriorated in recent years. According to the State
Program, during the period 1991-97, the morbidity in the country cumulatively increased by 41%.
According to WHO information, the TB notification rate in Kazakhstan increased by 57%. Annually
almost 14,500 new cases of active TB form are registered in the country. In 1997 over 17,000 new
cases were notified. In 1997, 5,948 patients died from TB including 1,358 patients who died in
detained facilities, where in 1997, 4,484 new TB patients were registered. The morbidity rate of this
contingency is 65 times higher than on the rest of the population. Some of this deterioration can be
attributed to the economic collapse following the break-up of the Soviet Union. The seeds of
stagnation can, however, be seen in published statistics well before this time suggesting that the
inherent inefficiencies of the Soviet economy may have contributed at least as much to the decline in
health status indicators as the break-up of the FSU. For TB, the former specialized system for TB
control was inefficient and inadequate to cope with the growing burden of TB in the country.

Inefficiencies. Like other FSU countries, the health sector in Kazakhstan is characterized by
large quantities of inputs, high rates of hospital use and too many physician specialists. Part of the
extensive development of infrastructure might be attributed to the relatively high health needs of the
population as reflected in the high morbidity and mortality rates. Kazakhstan also faces low
standards of living2, difficult environmental and ecological problems, low population density and
long distances between populated areas, and problems of transport and communication.
Disincentives for efficient use of resources generally continued through 1996 (including old
Moscow-based allocation and 18-line item budgeting norms), greatly exacerbating the problem of
under-funding and ignoring actual costs and volume of service use. Statistics, nonetheless, point to
commendable reductions in the numbers of beds, hospital admission rates, and average lengths of
stay (ALOS) since 1990. Between 1993 and 1997, for example, the number of beds fell by
approximately 40 percent, and the number of physicians fell by 4 percent. But the levels remain far
above OECD averages with 11.6 beds per 1,000 (versus 8.4 for OECD), inpatient days per capita at
3.0 (versus 2.5 for OECD) and ALOS 16.8 days (versus 14.4 for OECD) despite a relatively young
population.
Another area of continuing concern is the excess of physicians (3.1 per 1,000 versus 2.5 for
OECD and 2.06 for middle-income countries) and the bias of sophisticated, inpatient care over
primary care. Less than 18 percent of the country's physicians provide primary care (compared with
about 70 percent in Germany and 56 percent in Canada). USAID and British Know How Fund
(KHF) have provided some training and technical assistance support for expansion of family-based
practices and training of physicians in general practice and primary care. KHF has financed training
of existing specialized physicians for family practice through study tours to the UK, workshops, and
on-site training in polyclinics in Almaty oblast. The Program will support under Phase II, reform of
general practitioner (GP) training to include the training of GPs from the under-graduate level (See
Annex IB). Under Phase 1, the Program will support improved clinical training capability for GPs.

Underfunding. The share of the country's GDP devoted to health has declined dramatically
since the 1980s -- from 6 percent of GDP in the mid-1980s to 3.3 percent in 1990, and to 2.0 percent
in 1994 (versus 8.1 percent OECD average). In real terms, per capita health spending in 1994 was 41
percent of that in 1990. In terms of U.S. purchasing power parities, per capita spending went from
$100 per person in 1990 to about $50 per person in 1995. Spending on health as a percentage of
government budgets has been relatively stable since 1989, hovering at around 9-10 percent.
However, the decline in real GDP that Kazakhstan (and most other countries of the NIS) has suffered
over the past several years has contributed to reduced tax revenues being generated locally and
therefore less revenues for health services. In the short-term, the government might be able to
allocate a greater share of the public budget to health services. In the longer-term, public funding
will depend upon growth and expansion of the general economic base. Nominal public health care
expenditures in Pavlodar where the Bank is financing the Social Protection Project for example, has
fallen by 19% since 1995, without accounting for the effects of inflation - from 1604 in 1995 to 1295
tenge in 1997.
The short-term response to under-funding, instead, has been a greater reliance on more
diverse sources of revenue beginning in the early 1990s, including (i) revenues through patient co-
payments, especially pharmaceuticals, at the point of service; (ii) employer-based payroll
contributions; (iii) emerging private supplemental insurance sector; and (iv) enactment of a self-
sustaining public health insurance trust fund through new Compulsory Medical Insurance Fund
(CMIF) legislation. Two impeding developments, however, are likely to further erode the finances
available to the sector - the abolition of the Compulsory Medical Insurance Fund (CMIF) as a health
purchaserl. Contributions of 3% of payroll taxes previously allocated for the CMIF are being
collapsed into a unified payroll tax effective January 1, 1999, and the planned public expenditure
reduction in 1999 across all sectors in response to Kazakhstan financial situation.
'As of January 1999, the CMIF became the Medical Services Payment Center

Low Quality. The health care system is characterized by a historic reliance on specialist
medical care. First level care is often non-existent, underutilized or bypassed. Patients are kept in
the hospital for considerably longer than an equivalent case in the West. The overall average stays -
14.5 days (see table 2) in acute hospitals compared with 8.7 for the EU - would be even longer if
adjusted for case mix, as many of the admissions are for routine pathologies which would not lead to
hospitalization in the West. The lack of access to information on modern treatment protocols used in
the West has undoubtedly contributed to these longer length of stays. Other important factors have
been: (i) lack of medical supplies, which means that patients may have to wait for long periods before
an operation can take place; (ii) inadequate outpatient care, encouraging admissions and making
specialists reluctant to discharge patients; (iii) social and economic factors such as poor housing, so
that patients are kept in hospitals for social rather than medical reasons; and (iv) financial incentives
which penalize hospitals for smaller number of bed-days through budget and reimbursement
reductions.
Reform Initiatives. Health reform activity is not new in Kazakhstan. Individual oblasts have
participated in demonstrations of new financing and provider payment approaches for more than a
decade, extending back to the New Economic Mechanism (NEM) program under the FSU.
Demonstrations have taken place in Dzheskazgan, Semipalatinsk, South Kazakhstan, and Kokchetau
oblasts that used health insurance, family practice and fundholding models of service delivery. The
demonstrations led to national debate and a subsequent Presidential Decree in 1995 that established a
public Compulsory Medical Insurance system. These experimental sites provided some indication of
the feasibility of introducing health insurance throughout the country.
Government Strategy. The Government has taken steps to address some of the problems of
the health sector.  These measures include: (i) increased health sector revenue through the
introduction of the compulsory medical insurance funded, in part, from an earmarked payroll tax on
Page 6



employers; (ii) reduced hospital capacity through a nationwide reduction in staff positions and
hospital beds; (iii) privatization of facilities particularly pharmacies, some polyclinics and hospitals;
(iv) introduction, at least in some oblasts, of competitive procedures for the procurement of drugs;
and (v) merging of duplicate health services, and closing of health facilities. There have been
substantial reductions in the number of hospitals and ambulatory care facilities over the last five years
(47% reduction in number of public hospitals between 1993-97, 20% reduction in number of
policlinics); a parallel reduction in bed numbers (40% decline 1993-97) and staff (16% reduction in
number of doctors, 30% reduction in number of nurses) has also occurred. However, much of the
reduction in inpatient facilities has occurred in rural areas; some closures or disposal of assets have
taken place in cities, but less frequently, and only a very limited number of larger hospitals have been
closed.
The President's strategic policy "Kazakhstan 2030" of November 1997 addresses as a broad
policy agenda health, education, and welfare of the population, with special emphasis on: (i)
enhancing healthy lifestyles through improvements in water supply, reducing the number of facilities
polluting the environment and inflicting ecological damage, promoting physical exercise, observing
standards of hygiene and sanitation, avoiding consumption of drugs, and reducing consumption of
alcohol and tobacco; (ii) improving health of women and children, together with a broad pro-natalist
policy to curb the decline in population; and (iii) improving nutritional standards. Following the
broad strategy outlined in "Kazakhstan 2030"; the Government developed a State Program "Health
of the Nation", which was approved by the President on November 16, 1998. The President has
supported its main points of the strategy in a decree of May 18, 1998. The decree addresses eighteen
points of the strategy including the shift from inpatient to outpatient care, implementing WHO
treatment for TB, financing reforms and strengthening of primary health care. The proposed project
supports twelve of the fifteen specific health-related points set forth in the decree. The stated goal of
the State Program is to improve the health status of the population, develop and implement short-
terrn, middle-term and long-term action plans promoting the health care delivery system to a new
qualitatively new level. Further, the State Program outlines factors influencing the health of the
nation and identifies major approaches to its improvement. Great importance is attached to major
mleasures on health protection of the population related to health promotion, PHC development, and
control of TB and other socially important diseases as well as improvement of organization,
administration, and financing of the health sector. The proposed Health Reform Program will support
implementation of the State Program.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project concept was agreed upon during a Government/Bank workshop in February 1997
after discussions of the Health Sector Note.3 The project is consistent with the Government's health
strategy, including the Government's reform policy outlined in the President "Kazakhstan 2030"
strategy and the State Program - Health of the Nation. It will build on reform programs initiated in
several oblasts, while targeting more basic public health and health system delivery issues. The
concept of adapting the project to an APL approach was discussed with the Government in
September 1998 and on October 31, 1998, the First Deputy Prime Minister confirmed the
Government's wish to proceed on this basis. The APL will demonstrate a sustained commitment
from the Bank to the Government's State Program and it will provide the opportunity to adapt to
evolving priorities within the agreed framework of the overall program.
The project will address problems of under-funding and inefficiencies by promoting better
use of resources. Underfunding will be addressed by strengthening health financing mechanisms and
expanding new financing methods already tested in several oblasts. The project has identified new

sources and alternative approaches (e.g., taxes on alcohol and/or cigarettes) for generating revenues,
the roles of geopolitical units (e.g., rayon, oblast, and national) for collection and disbursement,
pooling and funds management, as well as allocation of revenues across the population. Both public
(government) and private (business, consumer out-of-pocket) sources of revenues will be pursued.
Under-funding will also be addressed by shifting constrained resources to outpatient care from the
more expensive and less efficient inpatient care. This will be possible through the upgrading of
outpatient and ambulatory care facilities and the emphasis on primary health care, including physical
upgrading, physician and other medical personnel training, provision of medical equipment, supplies
and pharmaceuticals. The project will address the inefficiencies in the system by shifting away from
an emphasis on inputs to quality and outcomes of services provided. This would be achieved by
working with the local authorities on annual work programs, including rationalization of facilities by
closing unnecessary facilities, merging duplicated services, and modernizing the ones that will be
used.
Declining health status will be addressed in two important ways: health promotion activities
and emphasis on tuberculosis (TB) control and treatment throughout the country. The TB activities
will finance improved provision of TB diagnostic services and upgrade of the quality of
bacteriological services; provision of anti-TB medicines and other treatment services; and
improvement of case management by adoption of WHO's recommended recording system. Health
promotion activities will address professional development and competence building for a wide range
of health and communication professionals; public education and communication through an
extensive health promotion campaign using print and broadcast media; and implementation of
national action plans on alcohol and tobacco. Moreover, efforts to improve system efficiency and
quality will contribute to increased capacity to deliver services.
Quality of care will be addressed through a strengthened primary health care system,
improved information systems, introduction and training on new treatment protocols, improved
clinical training capability for general practitioners and continuous upgrade of the skill base of the
practitioners to keep them abreast of clinical and therapeutic developments to ensure quality services.
Similar programs will be aimed at nurses, feldshers, and laboratory staff.
The project also addresses the issue of evaluation, replication and policy formulation with
a Health Policy and Evaluation component which will develop the capacity in the Government to
evaluate various interventions. This will include both interventions in the project and those ongoing
with other funding. This will result in better capacity in the Government to assess the effectiveness
of interventions and make decisions about policy replication to other parts of the country. The
emphasis will be to move away from one-time qualitative assessments which tend to be subjective to
a mix of qualitative and quantitative-based evaluations which are more objective and sound
methodologically.
This program will be supported by an APL, Government counterpart funding, and WHO and
USAID funding for technical assistance and training. The program will pool together best practices
in several oblasts related to new financing and provider payment approaches, fund holding models of
service delivery, in an integrated fashion in the pilot oblasts before expanding the successful aspects
countrywide under Phase 2 and 3 of the Program. Through the implementation of Phase 1, the Bank
will continue the policy dialogue with the Government to identify possible other areas for Bank
financing under Phase 2. Working in close collaboration with other donors such as WHO, USAID,
and Know How Fund will ensure complementarity and harmonization of efforts.

C: Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2for a detailed description and Annex 4for a detailed cost
breakdown):
The Project comprises four national and three regional components.  The national
components include: (1) Tuberculosis Control, (2) Health Promotion, (3) Health Policy and
Evaluation, and (4) Clinical Training Centers for GPs. The regional components are: (5) Primary
Health Care, (6) Facility Rationalization, and (7) Financial and Management Strengthening. In
addition, the project will support a project management structure at the national and regional levels to
coordinate program activities and manage the project.
(1) Tuberculosis (TB) Control. TB has been identified as one of the key priorities in the
implementation of the State Program Health of the Nation. The component will therefore, support the
Government's effort for the control of TB. In conjunction with WHO and USAID, the component
will finance nation wide activities to improve the diagnosis and treatment of TB, and adoption of
WHO's recommended system for case management. The component will finance: (i) initial and
continuous training for TB and PHC staff at the oblast and rayon levels; (ii) supply of anti TB drugs
for TB health facilities and PHC centers; (iii) basic tuberculosis laboratory equipment relevant for
diagnosis of TB; (iv) improvement of TB surveillance; (v) medical and other supplies; and (vi) local
and foreign technical assistance.
(2) Health Promotion. Health promotion in Kazakhstan needs substantial modernization, but this
cannot be achieved at once. Health promotion was identified as one of seven priority areas in the
President's Kazakhstan 2030 Strategy. Further, it has been singled out as one of the key elements in
the State Program. Public information and education on healthy lifestyles is limited, but is rapidly
acquiring importance with the new direction given by the President. An inter-sectoral Health
Promotion Council was created to develop a Health Promotion Action Plan with the newly created
National Center for Health Promotion, acting as secretariat. With technical assistance from WHO,
the component will support five key areas: (i) further development, publication and dissemination of
a national health promotion action plan; (ii) baseline and follow-up surveys on healthy lifestyle
indicators among adult and children populations; (iii) professional development and institution
building for health and communication professionals; (iv) public education and communication
through an extensive health promotion campaign using print and broadcast media; and (v) design and
implementation of national action plans on alcohol and tobacco.
(3) Health Policy and Evaluation. Experience with systemic health program evaluation is limited in
Kazakhstan.  The component will evaluate the oblast health programs, help disseminate
recommendations to other oblasts and prepare a proposal for replication throughout the country. This
component will also support the enhancement of clinical information in Kazakhstan and the use of
evidence based medicine. The goal of this activity will be to strengthen the capacity of the health
care system to follow modern trends in health care and to implement them in practice. The project
will provide funding for: (i) monitoring and evaluating specific indicators; (ii) training of oblast staff
and facility directors in measuring indicators for project evaluation; (iii) training of oblast and health
facility directors in the use of indicators for their own management of facilities; (iv) developing
capacity at the national and local levels to evaluate interventions in the health sector; (v) carrying out
operational research activities; (vi) purchasing recent medical literature and materials at selected
sites; and (vii) developing a framework for evaluating and adapting medical protocols.
(4) Clinical Training Centers for General Practitioners (GPs). Creating a cadre of general
practitioners is a key element in the State Program, to provide primary health care throughout the
country. Training of GPs is clearly important. The Bank is closely collaborating with the Know How
Page 9



Fund (KHF), Department for International Development (DFID), to assist the Government implement
its GP development program. DFID has agreed to provide about $1.6 million over a three-year
period commencing in mid-1999 to develop a national medical education curriculum and GP training
capacity. To complement the DFID initiative, this component will help establish clinical training
centers at the medical higher education institutions (Almaty, Aktubinski, Astana, Karaganda,
Semipalatinsk, and Shymkent) and post-graduate medical institutes (Almaty and Pavlodar) to create
appropriate training environments and improve the quality of training. The project will support: (i)
rehabilitation of appropriate facilities; (ii) medical equipment and supplies; (iii) teaching equipment
and materials; and (iv) minibuses. Under phase 2 of the APL, further support and reform of GP
training will be undertaken building on the combined experience of KBF and Bank inputs during
Phase 1.
(5) Primary Health Care (PHC). The project seeks to support the Government's strategy to establish
new PHC centers. This includes the reorganization of existing rural FAPs and SVAs, creation of
urban family group practices, training of GPs capable of providing basic services and upgrading the
facilities in which they will function. The component will support a program to train GPs, including
management training and continuously upgrade the skill base of GPs and other health professionals to
keep them abreast of clinical and therapeutic developments. The focus under Phase I is on
improving PHC services in rural and urban areas in two oblasts to diagnose and treat illness
effectively and in an integrated manner; this will be expanded in subsequent phases to the entire
territory of the country. The project will focus attention on treatment of priority diseases identified as
being significant causes of morbidity and mortality and having cost effective interventions. The
component will finance: (i) initial and continuous training for PHC staff; (ii) limited physical
upgrading of facilities; (iii) supply of emergency drugs for urban and rural PHC centers; (iv) basic
equipment packages for urban and rural PHC centers including laboratory equipment; (v) medical
and other supplies; and (vi) vehicles, on a selected basis.
(6) Financial and Management Strengthening. The two participating oblasts of Phase I have
initiated the process of health financing reforms in rural and urban areas. Funds are being pooled and
the benefit package redefined. Under the Program this work would continue and in addition,
financial management mechanisms will be strengthened, and oblast-wide training centers for
managers and providers will be established. The new PHC centers will have greater legal and
financial independence, flexibility in staffing, and incentive-based per capita funding. Per capita
funding will include primary care initially, and specialty-based services later. Simple but effective
management infornation systems (MIS) will be developed. Practice managers will be trained to
analyze clinical and financial data and provide management expertise to PHC Centers. Hospitals will
receive incentive-based payments as well, using a simple per-admission case-mix system. New
community advisory boards will be formed to involve greater local participation. The component
will support the implementation of action plans, tailored for each of the two oblasts during Phase I,
and for other oblasts in subsequent phases, which will build on successful pilot experiences in
Semipalatinsk and Dzheskazgan. With financial support from USAID, the component will finance:
(a) technical assistance; (b) training; and (c) computer and related equipment for MIS.
(7) Facility Rationalization and Rehabilitation. The Government has taken a major step forward
in the rationalization process by closing a significant number of beds, and facilities, especially in
rural areas. However, as noted under the Government's Strategy Section, much of the reduction in
inpatient facilities has occurred in rural areas; some closures or disposal of assets have taken place in
cities, but less frequently, and only a very limited number of larger hospitals have been closed. The
component will support and expand the Government's efforts by promoting the merging of urban and
smaller specialized facilities under one roof to improve quality of care and generation of significant
savings. A careful assessment will be needed in some urban areas to identify what may be achievable
on this score. The actual decision of any future consolidation of facilities will require careful
Page 10



planning as old facilities are closed and new ones commissioned. Specific rationalization plans will
be designed and agreed upon annually in the course of project implementation. The component will
provide assistance to: (i) upgrade rayon hospitals which, by their location, will not be subject to
inclusion in any consolidation program; (ii) assist efforts to evaluate options for consolidating
facilities; (iii) manage the consolidation phase; and (iv) physically upgrade facilities where necessary
to integrate functions. The component will also support reforms within institutions to improve their
financial and clinical performance outcomes.
2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the Program:
A number of key policy and institutional reforms will be supported by the project, such as:
*  Under-funding. The project will address the problems of under-funding by identifying options for
"sin taxes" and new private sources of funding and by promoting improved use of existing
resources. It will promote sustainable improvements in the quality of PHC, by shifting resources
from hospital and the inpatient component of polyclinics. The program will accomplish this directly
in the short-term by supplementing available resources for PHC, but over time, the increased
capacity of PHC and new financing systems will gradually attract a greater share of resources to
PHC through market mechanisms internal to the health sector. The program will also further
explore the feasibility of increasing cost recovery in some areas. These could include charging
patients for self-referrals to hospitals, i.e. patients who bypass primary level care physicians in non-
emergency cases; small daily charges for medical supplies but taking into account the need for
exemptions; and continue the development of charge units in hospitals which charge for private
accommodation and other services.
*  Decentralization of Decision Making. The project will provide greater flexibility to providers to
manage primary care practices and allocate their resources. The financing system and legal changes
will encourage the facility leadership to be innovative and to use the autonomy and increased
authority granted. The management system will provide the tools for making decisions on resource
allocations.
*  Incentive-Based Care Financing. The flow of funds will change under the program to "follow" the
patient. Over the course of the program, the new payment systems will be integrated to create
maximum incentives for efficiency and quality improvement throughout the system. Payments will
be made for services used and the outcomes gained, instead of only based on number of inputs. The
Program will promote primary care capitation and the introduction of a case based payment system
for hospital care which will create strong economic incentives to improve efficiency. Hospital
services will be paid on a per case basis, i.e. per activity rather than inputs and capacity. Improved
efficiency will be reflected in measures such as a reduction in the average length of stay and an
overall reduction in the number of beds. Incentive-based payment systems combined with increased
management autonomy are increasingly recognized as perhaps the single most significant catalyst
for behavioral change and improved technical and allocation efficiency in the health sector in
middle and upper-income countries.
*  Improved Efficiency of Hospital Services and Rationalization.  Although there have been
substantial reductions in the number of hospitals and ambulatory care facilities over the last five
years, much of this reduction in inpatient facilities has occurred in rural areas only some closures
have taken place in cities, and only a very limited number of larger hospitals have been closed. This
approach has not maximized cost reduction as the true economic benefits of hospital rationalization
are to be found in the merger and closure of large, duplicated hospitals sites. The project will
provide for the design and implementation of annual rationalization plans to identify specific
rationalization measures such as integration of vertical systems, merging of urban and smaller
Page I I



specialized facilities under one roof, closure of duplicate services, and better long-run sustainability.
* Improved Quality of Primary Health Care. PHC facilities will be able to provide better quality
care because of inputs to be provided under the project, such as better trained staff, improved
equipment and information systems, introduction of and training on new protocols, expanded
supplies of pharmaceuticals, and health promotion. The financing system will also support and
encourage continuous quality improvements.
* Strengthening Policy and Information Base for Clinical and Economic Decision Making. In
response to problems of current information due to under-funding in recent years, the Program will
support the updating of clinical information. This will include materials for the medical training
institutes and the National Medical Library. The Program will also support the development of
standards of good practice leading to new clinical protocols. Doctors will benefit with better
information to treat their patients and patients will benefit from doctors improved knowledge about
latest treatment procedures.
*  Integration of Reforns. Although reforms have been underway in several oblasts, they have
been implemented in a fragmented manner. The Program will pool together, in an integrated
manner, best practices from several oblasts before expanding the successful aspects countrywide
under subsequent phases of the Program.
3. Benefits and target population:
The main benefits of the project will be improved: (i) delivery of services and a more
sustainable health system; (ii) patterns of service use and referral by increasing quality of services
provided at PHC centers, including actively improving relations with their communities; (iii)
prevention and community-oriented services by having the PHC centers play a central role in their
communities through provision of preventive care and health promotion; and (iv) decisions of
providers about health care through the creation of strengthened information and management
structures integrated with appropriate incentives. In the short-term, there will be improved primary
and acute care, which combined in the long-term with TB control and health promotion activities will
result in better health indicators. A further benefit will be the testing and evaluation of models for
replication countrywide. Specific benefits will be improvements in the provision of primary health
care and in ambulatory facilities for out-patient care; strengthened links between primary and
secondary health care; cost reductions by merging services and closing unnecessary facilities;
improved quality of care through provision of equipment and drugs, updated protocols and training
for their proper use; and improved financial sustainability through pooling of resources, consolidation
of benefit packages and refined payment mechanisms. An additional anticipated benefit will be
changing attitudes of the population towards healthier life styles, including behavior related to better
diets and nutrition and reduction in the consumption of alcohol and tobacco.
Target Population: Under Phase 1, the Program will have a direct impact on over
3.2 million people (about 20% of the national population) in the two participating oblasts: East
Kazakhstan oblast (1,660,600) and Almaty oblast (1,640,000). The entire population of Kazakhstan
will benefit from the Health Promotion component which will include activities related to healthy
lifestyle, including promoting reduction in the consumption of tobacco and alcohol. In addition, the
entire population will benefit from TB activities, which will be addressed in Phase 1 of the program.
The population of project beneficiaries is likely to have a significantly larger proportion of women
and children, who can be expected to use the facilities more and to receive services with greater
short-run impact on health status and outcomes. In the long-term the entire population of the country
is expected to benefit from the replication of the oblast-level activities throughout the country, and
from health behavior improvements. Detailed information on the socio-economic status in the oblasts
participating in Phase I is included in Annex 9.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Responsibility for project implementation rests with the Committee of Health in the Ministry
of Health, Education and Sports (MHES). Implementation of the oblast level components will rest
with the health authorities of Almaty and East Kazakhstan Oblasts.
Project Management and Coordination: Overall responsibility for project management and
coordination rests with the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) established in the Committee of Health.
The PCU was established with financing from a PHRD grant and played a key role in project
preparation and managing the work of the preparation team. The PCU is working well and is being
expanded to cope with the increasing demands when the project is approved. Two small Regional
Coordination Units (RCUs) are being established, to coordinate project activities at the oblast level.
Regional Coordinators have been appointed and are being financed with PPF funding. In addition to
coordination, the PCU will be responsible for implementation functions such as project accounting,
procurement, disbursements, consolidation of quarterly and annual progress reports, annual work
programs and budgets. It will also provide training and technical assistance coordination, project
supervision and monitoring, and assistance to the RCUs. The PCU reports to the Deputy Chairman
of the Health Committee. The RCUs report to the Deputy Akim of the oblast. To facilitate
coordination at the city and rayon levels, one staff from the Health Department will be designated to
liaise with the respective RCU. These staff will be the focal points for all city/rayon activities and
will contribute to the preparation of work programs, budgets, and progress reports.
Project Implementation Manual: A Project Implementation Manual (PIM) was prepared to
facilitate the management and implementation of the project. The PIM includes: (i) detailed project
objectives and description; (ii) key implementation issues, and strategies; (iii) summary of procedures
for monitoring project implementation; (iv) guidelines for processing withdrawal applications under
the loan; (v) methods of procurement to be followed as per the Procurement Schedule in the Loan
Agreement; (vi) guidelines for the use of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) and overall project
funds; (vii) procedures for using the Special Account, including those for replenishment; and (viii)
sample bidding documents and contract for national shopping of civil works. The PIM was prepared
as a condition of negotiations by the PCU with technical assistance from Project Management and
Procurement Specialists financed by a USTDA Trust Fund. The PCU will be required to organize
training for the PCU and RCUs, and other project staff in order to ensure an understanding of the
procedures specified in the PIM.
Finance, Accounting and Auditing Arrangements. The PCU will be responsible for
financial management of the project (see Annex 8for detailed financial management arrangements).
The Financial and Accounting Officer in the PCU, with technical assistance from a short-term
Financial Management Specialist financed under a USTDA Trust Fund has designed a Project and
Financial Management Information System (MIS), which includes, inter alia, an accounting and
control module with the capability to record and retrieve in a timely manner, all financial transactions
under the project. The MIS complies with internationally accepted standards and will (i) reliably
record and report all assets, liabilities, and financial transactions of the project; and (ii) provide
reliable financial information for managing and monitoring project activities. The accounting module
will have a Chart of Accounts, which will reflect the sources of funds; it will be broken down into
different types of expenditures by type and component. Further, it will provide information on the
receipt and use of funds and will be able to produce financial reports comparing budget with actual
expenditures at any given time. The system will be capable of providing financial data to measure
performance when linked to the outputs of the project. The PCU will maintain consolidated accounts
for the Project and will ensure appropriate accounting of the funds provided. It will prepare Project
Management Reports (PMR) on a quarterly basis. These reports will include financial statements,
project progress reports and procurement management reports. The PMR will be in a format
Page 13



discussed during negotiations and will follow examples given in the Bank's LACI Implementation
Handbook. The special accounts will be audited in accordance with the Guidelines for Financial
Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank (March 1982) and the Financial
Accounting Reporting and Auditing Handbook, 1995. The audit report will be of such scope and
details as the Bank may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by an independent auditor,
acceptable to the Bank, for SOEs against which disbursements have been made or are due to be made
from the loan, and SOEs which will be included in the audit reports accompanying the financial
statements. The audited financial statements of the special accounts, and SOEs of the preceding
fiscal year, including a separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements made against certified
SOEs, will be sent to the Bank within six months of the end of the Government's fiscal year.
Annual Work Programs: The project will be implemented with reliance on annual work
programs (WPs) and budgets. WPs will be prepared and submitted to the Bank by July 15 of each
year to coincide with the Government budget cycle. Submission of the draft 1999 WP is a condition
of effectiveness. The Regional Coordinators (RCs) will be responsible for the preparation of the WPs
for the oblast/rayon activities. The PCU, with inputs from participating agencies, will prepare WP's
related to the national level Program. In addition, it will review and consolidate the WPs to
incorporate specific activities to be undertaken during the year by the PCU. The investment costs
included in the WPs will have to be clearly spelled out. The WPs would include inter alia: (a) a
statement of the objectives to be pursued for the coming year; (b) an up-to-date inventory of the
health facilities to be rehabilitated during the year; (c) proposed medical equipment and
pharmaceuticals to be procured during the year; (d) rationalization measures, i.e. proposed closures,
amalgamation of health services, other measures to save costs; (e) total estimated costs for the budget
year (rehabilitation, equipment, supplies); (f) financing plan (World Bank/other donors/local
financing); and (g) conclusions and recommendations.
Reporting: The RCs will prepare and submit to the PCU progress reports on activities
performed at the oblast/rayon levels. The PCU will prepare reports for national activities and those
performed by PCU directly. It will consolidate the quarterly reporting into one quarterly PMR for the
entire project, which will include financial statements, progress reports and procurement management
reports. The first report will be issued three months after Loan Effectiveness. Subsequent reports
will be submitted 45 days after the end of each quarter. The reports will include: (a) a summary of
project activities by component; (b) a description of the main achievements against agreed
implementation targets and disbursements schedules, and the problems encountered; (c)
recommendations on how to solve problems and comments on progress in implementing previous
recommendations; (d) a description of component activities; (e) a presentation of the financial
situation of the project in terms of actual versus budget for the major expenditure categories, and the
financing of these categories; and (f) a presentation of the financial situation of each component.
Annual Progress reports will be prepared and presented to the Bank by February 15 each year
summarizing project activities during the year and covering the topics addressed in the quarterly
reports.
Mid-Term Review: At the time of the estimated mid-point completion of the project --June
2001, the Borrower will be required to undertake a mid-term review of the implementation of the
project. This review will be undertaken in consultation with, and in a manner satisfactory to the
Bank. By September 30, 2001, the Borrower will prepare and furnish to the Bank a report regarding
the results of the mid-term review, including progress achieved in the implementation of the project
and measures recommended to ensure the achievement of the project's operation and development
objectives during the remaining of the project period.
Page 14



Implementation Completion Report (ICR). The PCU will prepare in collaboration with the
Bank, an ICR upon Project completion, and in any event, not later than six months after final
disbursement of the Loan proceeds. The ICR will include an assessment of the execution of the
project, costs and benefits derived or to be derived, the performance of the Borrower, the Bank and
other agencies involved in project implementation, regarding their respective obligations and
accomplishments, and including lessons learned. The ICR will also include plans for the future
operation of the facilities which had been financed under the project, including proposed indicators to
monitor and evaluate future operations.
Project Monitoring and Evaluation. Project monitoring and evaluation will be carried out in
five main areas: (a) procurement and physical delivery of goods; (b) physical implementation of
project activities; (c) impact on service delivery; (d) financial management and control of project
funds; and (e) capacity building under the project. A continuous assessment of these activities will be
carried out in the context of the Project Implementation Plan and the annual work programs. Project
outcomes will be evaluated in terms of their impact on (i) quality of services; (i) changes in clinical
protocols and utilization patters; (iii) changes in efficiency, both technical and in terms of allocation
of funds; (iv) overall cost effectiveness; and (v) consumer and provider satisfaction with the delivery
of services. Project implementation progress and the effective utilization of project funds will be
monitored through well defined Key Performance Indicators (Annex IA).
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Countrywide project versus specific regions. The decision was made at the Identification
Seminar in February 1997 to design a program in selected oblasts in order to pull together and expand
in an integrated fashion the reforms which are being undertaken in specific oblasts. This approach
will allow the Government to test which parts work best in the integrated approach in order to make
any adjustments before extending the system to the entire country. During late stages of project
design, however, the Government issued a State Program - Health of the Nation and requested the
Bank to expand the scope of the project nationwide. This issue was discussed in great detail within
the Bank and with Government and a decision was taken to change the approach from a single
investment instrument to that of an Adaptable Program Loan. Under the APL, three phases of
activities are planned. In Phase 1, TB control, Health Promotion, Health Policy Evaluation, and
Clinical Training Centers for GPs will be addressed nationwide, while other key components will
remain at the oblast level and will be expanded to additional oblasts during subsequent phases.
Number and choice of oblasts. The former Ministry of Health advocated regional
components to be implemented in four oblasts, however the Ministry of Finance and the Bank felt
that 2 oblasts for the first project would be more practical from the point of view of implementation
and coordination. The Government selected two oblasts on the basis of mutually agreed criteria (a)
representativeness of the population--demographic mix and health status; (b) representativeness of
health delivery system; (c) mix of both rural and urban population; (d) economic base and potential
for near-term economic growth; (e) historic experience in reform programs, especially in the health
sector; (f) strength of leadership; (g) willingness and readiness of local providers to reform; (h) other
donor programs which offer a potential for partnership and collaboration; (i) perceived by other
oblasts as similar; and (j) accessible by means of transportation for learning/collaboration by other
oblasts.
Page 15



Small genuine pilot versus more complex integrated program. The possibility of doing a
small, relatively quickly prepared and implemented pilot was not supported by the Government.
Instead, the Government requested an integrated program to be tested in 2-3 oblasts in order to pull
together the various reform programs that are being undertaken in a fragmented manner in some
oblasts. These integrated activities will be tested in the selected oblasts and in this sense the oblast-
based components could be seen as pilots. While the integrated approach will contribute to the
complexity of the project, it will have the positive effect of testing an integrated approach to health
sector reform in the selected oblasts before expanding it countrywide under subsequent phases of the
APL. The desire to test the integrated program outweighs the advantages of a quick, with limited
activities pilot program.
Integrated care versus vertical programs. The Program will focus on the provision of
integrated health care targeted at the primary level, including Safe Motherhood, Integrated
Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) instead of vertical programs countrywide which could
focus on specific issues or diseases. Vertical programs, such as immunization or TB control, are
effective in addressing actual problems, i.e. to quickly reestablish immunization levels over a short
period of time. However, these programs are often less cost efficient than integrated programs.
Some of the most cost-efficient programs are aimed at reducing the highest burden of disease through
PHC and a strong secondary health system. The Government supports an integrated program which
includes the shift of resources to the primary level aimed at a more cost effective system.
Support to the School of Public Health. WHO assisted the Government in the establishment
of the School. In mid-February 1998 the Bank received a request by the newly appointed Minister to
consider financing of the school under the project. During discussions in April 1998 with the
Minister, it was agreed that given the complex issues to be addressed by the project, it was not
appropriate to include financing for the school under the project. Instead, the Bank offered to explore
possibilities of financing outside the project.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The Bank has gained experience with project implementation in Kazakhstan. Currently there
are 14 projects under implementation and several others are in advanced stage of processing. The
1996 and 1998 Country Portfolio Project Reviews (CPPRs) identified valuable lessons for projects in
Kazakhstan including (i) the necessity of full commitment and ownership by the Government for
technical assistance (TA) to be effective; (ii) the necessity for TA to be tightly managed and closely
supervised; and (iii) advance staffing of PCUs with core procurement staff (by pre-appraisal). In
addition, a lesson from the preparation and implementation of the Social Protection Project was that
the Bank should foster ownership from the project from the outset. Involving technical and middle
management staff in project design ensures continuity despite numerous high level managerial
changes that happen during project preparation and implementation.  Early setting up of a
coordination unit also provides for early training of staff. Another lesson is that selection of technical
assistance should emphasize capacity building to ensure that the know how is passed from the TA to
local staff.
Review of lessons from implementation of health projects in ECA countries show that: (a)
health sector reform is a lengthy, politicized process requiring (i) carefully sequenced changes; (ii)
strong support to strengthen countries' overstretched institutional capacity for implementing reforms;
and (iii) marketing of the reforms to lawmakers, the medical community, and the public; (b) simple
projects with uncomplicated implementation arrangements are more likely to succeed; and (c) shorter
projects linked to smaller, more realistic sets of reforms are more likely to be effective. Project
implementation under other Bank-financed projects in Kazakhstan also indicate the need for
simplicity of project design and implementation mechanisms, given limited institutional capacity and
weak financial systems. Achieving simplicity of design is however difficult given the need for the
project to pool together best reform practices from several oblasts in an integrated fashion. All the
oblast-related components are interdependent and none could be eliminated if the project is to achieve
its objectives of improving health sector performance, i.e. financing and management reforms, better
utilization of resources, and improved standards in the quality of services. Experiences gained and
lessons learned have been taken into account in designing the project in the following ways:
* the government and specifically the Ministry of Health, Education and Sports and health
authorities in the participating oblasts have shown high commitment to the objectives of the
project and have been closely involved in project design and preparation;
*  a Project Preparation and Coordination Unit was established at an early stage and a Director and
a Financial and Accounting Officer appointed. The PCU has managed well the preparation
process, including utilization of funds under the Japanese Grant;
*  reforms to be pursued under the project build partnerships in the strategic areas already initiated
by the former Ministry of Health;
* a social assessment was conducted with the participation of a local institute and findings
incorporated into the project design; and
* simple but effective implementation arrangements were agreed upon prior to the pre-appraisal
mission and are working well at the central level. Regional Coordination Units are being
established in the two participating oblasts.
4. Indications of Borrower commitment and ownership:
* The project was included in the 1996 - 1998 Public Investment Program and is included in the
State Investment Program 1998-2000.
* At the request of the Government a PPF was processed and a letter of agreement was
countersigned by the Minister of Finance on January 5, 1999.
Page 19



*  The former Minister of Health appointed the Vice-Chairman of the Committee of Health as
Project Coordinator; a PCU was established shortly after identification with support from a
Japanese Grant.
* The city and oblast health departments have been closely involved in project design.
*  The Bank received a letter dated September 4, 1998 from the First Deputy Prime Minister
requesting that the scope of the project be expanded nationwide.
*  In his address to the nation summarizing the strategy for "Kazakhstan 2030", the President
singled out health promotion as one of seven priorities. The presidential decree of May 18, 1998
outlined fifteen specific health-related priorities to be implemented under a state program "Health
of the People"; the project will addresses 12 out of these priorities.
*  The Committee of Health sees this project as a key vehicle to pool together various reform
initiatives being pursued in a fragmented manner in different areas of the country and as catalyst
to ensure complementarity and harmonization of efforts by donors. In addition, the Government
and specifically the COH sees the project as the key instrument to implement the State Program
Health of the Nation.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The project builds on the achievements of MHES in health finance and PHC reforms, with
technical and financial support from the Bank, USAID, KHF. Because of the Bank's experience in
the health sector in other ECA countries, the Bank is in a position to help MHES to bring together
best practices and eventually replicate them throughout the country. The proposed Program aims at
not only obtaining specific health objectives, but most importantly, will be able to influence the
general direction of health reform in the country. An integrated approach to health reform will be
pursued, addressing inter alia the need to improve the efficiency of health services and to introduce
incentives for more cost effective management and delivery of health care. As noted earlier, health
reforms are being pursued in a fragmented manner and the Bank is in a good position to leverage
interest and financial support from other international donors to integrate within the project, various
successfui efforts currently under way. In addition, the commitment by the Government at the
highest level to design and implement a health promotion strategy will prove of relevance to other
countries in the region which have been reluctant to address this important issue.
E: Summary Project Analysis
(Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annexes 5 and 6)
1. Economic (supported by Annex 5):
[X] Cost-Benefit Analysis
The primary finding illustrated in Table 1 of Annex 5 is that there are tangible potential
economic benefits to be gained from the project, but these are not as large as the overall quantifiable
costs. Discount rate for calculating the NPV was performed at 10%, based on the Bank's traditional
approach of using a notional range of 10-12% opportunity cost for borrowing for capital. A sensitivity
analysis was performed using an NPV of 4%; the results were the same in termns of direction, though
relative amounts changed (from US$ 5.7 to 5.1 million). A substantial portion of savings stem from
savings that accrue to individuals and families outside the health sector, and potentially to the employer.
The economic justification therefore lies to a large extent in the fact of (i) benefits going to patients and
families and their employers and (ii) from a health care standpoint that the intervention is directed at
shifting health care toward known, established cost-effective strategies for addressing an excessive
burden of disease.
At the same time, the project will have an impact on allocative efficiency, by targeting those
diseases that contribute substantially to the overall disease burden (e.g. tuberculosis), and technical
efficiency, by emphasizing cost-effective methods of treating each disease. The difficulty in placing
Page 20



a monetary value on health benefits means that the analysis of the overall economic impact of the
project is incomplete. Despite this, the concentration on diseases that deliver high benefits for each
dollar spent targeted at poorer rural areas should ensure that the project has a significant impact on
health status, delivering high value for money and serving as an example of good practice for the rest
of the country. Second, the health promotion component will yield behavioral impacts in the short-
run, which can boost productivity in the workplace, and also can be expected to have significant
impacts on morbidity and mortality of both men and women. Most directly measurable impacts in
the short-term will be on the productivity gains of the workforce through fewer sick days; in the
longer-term, beyond the life of the project, the impacts will be measurable through health status
indicators such as expected years of life. Under conservative assumptions, an improvement of
60,000 Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) might be expected from anti-tobacco interventions
alone. This could mean over $11 million gains in workers wages alone. It also could yield
significant new revenues through alcohol and tobacco taxes. These monetary, productivity, and
health status benefits are not included in the economic analysis but they represent anticipated, if hard
to measure, economic benefits.
2. Financial (see Annex 6): NPV=US$-35.99 million
The detailed financial impact of the project is shown in Table I ofAnnex 6. It shows
that over a twenty year period, the estimated savings from structural reforms is $78.95 million; on the
negative side, total additional discounted capital plus recurrent costs of $109.93 million amount to a net
negative cash flow of $30.98 million. Total repayments (discounted) amount to $38.54 million. The
overall present value of net negative cash flow (net costs plus repayment) is $18.17 million. This
amounts to less than $2.50 per person over 20 years, or less than $0.15 per year for each inhabitant.
If estimates of incremental health budget revenues are added in, assuming straight-line
growth and GDP growth per annum of about 3 percent per year, the overall present value of net negative
cash flow is $2.3 million., and total cash flow over the life of the loan is actually positive by 5.68
million. A second factor for consideration is the expected income elasticity for health spending. The
national health budget was estimated to be about US$669 million in 1997. At a steady 3.0 percent GDP
growth starting in the year 2000, coupled with a relative growth of commitment to health spending
consistent with other middle income countries (a 10% relative increase in public spending), the increase
in the budget annually would be $88.98 million in year 2, rising to about a 43.1% increase or about
$287.67 million increment in year 5 in real terms. These increases would easily absorb expected
negative cash flows. Even under an assumption of no growth, the impact on the health budget would be
extremely small. Over a 20 year period, it would absorb less than 1% (or about $1.5 million per year) of
the total health budget.
There are other options as well for closing the fiscal impact gap. These include new user
charges, a more aggressive rationalization strategy, or new taxes. The health promotion component
can generate new revenues, for example, through new taxes on alcohol and tobacco. Cross-country
comparisons indicate a negative price elasticity of around 0.5 for tobacco, suggesting both new
revenues and fewer smokers.
3. Technical:
As described above the project will address several issues facing the health sector. The
project is technically justified in its design to effectively address these issues based on the following
characteristics:
*  Financing reforms coupled with strengthening primary health care levelfacilities. The finance
reforms will promote economic incentives and the primary health care component will provide
the training and equipment needed to strengthen PHC. The project addresses the under-funding
Page 21



and need for better care by moving towards fornation of new PHCs and family practice groups,
and an incentive-based payment system which encourages providers to treat patients cost
effectively. In addition, the primary health care centers would have the freedom and incentives
to allocate funds in a more flexible manner than the previous Soviet budget system. In order to
provide the services at the primary level, the project would upgrade the facilities with necessary
equipment and supplies and the skills of the providers in order to meet the new demands on the
primary level.
* Facility rationalization. Facility rationalization will be addressed in two ways. The first is for
the health authorities to review the current facilities and usage and prepare rationalization plans.
Plans can be based first on duplicative facilities and services, unsafe and unusable buildings in
need of too much repair, specialized facilities which can be incorporated into other facilities, and
further reduction of beds in hospitals. The second approach to rationalization will be a function
of the financing reforms. As incentives push money into primary care, utilization of hospital
services are expected to decline. During the course of the project and afterward the health sector
will go through a rationalization process by closing wings of hospitals, reducing beds, and
closing some facilities that become unnecessary.
* Health promotion in key areas. The project will have an impact in the long term on the health
status by focusing efforts in a few key areas including alcohol and tobacco use. Consumption of
alcohol and tobacco has a significant impact on morbidity and mortality manifested in cardio-
vascular diseases and cancers. By concentrating the efforts and funds in these key areas, there
would be long-term gains. The project will also address other health promotion issues, such as
public education and communication, professional development and competence building, and
finance surveys of healthy lifestyle indicators.
* Policy research and evaluation. The project will include activities in evaluation and research to
guide formulation of policy, evaluate benefits and costs of reforms in participating oblasts, and
raise the quality of clinical inputs and delivery of services.
4. Institutional:
The Implementation Agency for the Project is the Committee of Health in MHES. This is the
first full-fledged health project to be financed by the Bank. Two other projects have supported health
reform, but because of their nature they have not required strong institutional support from the
Ministry. The Social Service Component of the Social Protection Project, which finances delivery of
health services in two oblasts (South Kazakhstan and Pavlodar) has been implemented directly by the
health authorities in the oblasts. A Health Financing Component under an on-going Technical
Assistance Project provided limited technical assistance and training of staff to the former Ministry of
Health.
MHES has made considerable efforts to put institutional arrangements in place from the
outset. The PCU was established shortly after project identification and was quickly staffed with two
capable individuals (Director and Financial and Accounting Officer). The PCU managed the
preparation process in a participatory manner, it coordinated the work of consultants, and managed
the use of PHRD funds well. As the work of the PCU will expand during project implementation, the
PCU will be supported by technical assistance in the areas of Project Management, Procurement,
Financial Management, and Information Systems. The two first consultants will provide services for
about 18 months each while the latter two would be hired only for a few months each. The PCU
prepared an RFP for the recruitment of technical assistance in two phases, the first to be financed
under the PPF and the second once the loan becomes effective. As a condition of negotiations, the
PCU, with assistance from consultants, prepared a Project Implementation Manual (Section 4) to
facilitate the management and implementation of the project. The consultants in the PCU will be
Page 22



required to organize training for the PCU and RCUs, and other project staff in order to ensure an
understanding of the procedures specified in the PIM. The RCUs are being established and key staff
recruited. A workshop took place during project appraisal for better understanding of the project and
Bank procedures and practices. A second workshop will be organized during project launch.
Project management and monitoring has been facilitated by the design and implementation of
a Project Management Information System, which has been installed at the level of the PCU and
which will be expanded to the RCUs. Additional institutional support will be provided through
technical assistance in the areas of health financing, facility rationalization, primary health care,
health promotion, TB control, procurement of medical equipment/supplies, and pharmaceuticals. As
a condition of negotiations, the financial module of the MIS has been designed.
As part of project preparation, institutional and soeial assessments were undertaken. The
social assessment focused on the experience of health users and providers in the two oblasts, and
their priority for the quality of care received. The institutional assessment focused on a different
group of stakeholders, i.e. health sector personnel of the two oblasts. Some of the issues identified
have been addressed in the design of the project, others will need to be taken into account during
project implementation. The Institutional Assessment found that:
Changes and restructuring in Kazakhstan has been rapid and large-scale; the impacts have
been significant. There appears to be no specific policy for handling either the social or human
resources impacts of the changes although informal approaches to staff redundancies are producing a
picture in which:
O  the number of positions identified as being redundant is not necessarily the same as the number
of people actually employed. Because some positions are on paper only, reductions in positions
may not always affect people;
o  non-medical staff lose their positions before medical staff,
o  people close to retirement lose their positions before young people;
?  people may technically lose their positions and salary but stay on the "books" because of other
employment related benefits;
O  there are very few medically qualified people registered as unemployed;
O  some doctors who have lost their positions through restructuring have managed to set up private
clinics; and
O  there are significant amounts of hidden unemployment, and the participating oblasts - Almaty and
East Kazakhstan are oblasts with high level of hidden unemployment.
5. Social:
The social assessment drew on a mixture of primary and secondary research data. Primary
research was undertaken through twenty focus groups of randomly selected rural anc urban residents
and separate groups of nurses and doctors in East Kazakhstan and Almaty oblasts; and interviews
with key decision-making-personnel in MHES and the former Compulsory Medical Insurance Fund
at both national and local levels. Secondary data sources such as Kazakhstan-based research
undertaken on health and relevant social issues including nationwide household surveys, oblast level
household surveys and oblast level quantitative research such as focus groups. The overall purpose
of the focus groups was to gain first hand information from people about their experiences and
perceptions of health care. The emphasis was on obtaining information about access to services, the
cost of services, and the quality and availability of services from the point of view of their
experience. It was also important to gain an insight into changes in people's lives, their perception of
the impact of those changes on their health, their experiences of changes in health services and
indications of the type of health care and services they would like to see developed. The finding of
Page 23



the assessment were presented and discussed at a workshop conducted in Almaty in November 1997.
The project responds to several of the issues raised including access to care, skills of health providers,
quality of services including equipment and supplies. The assessment identified the following:
Access to care. Physical access to health care has emerged as a significant issue particularly
for people in rural areas. The contributing factors include: (i) cost of travel; (ii) significantly reduced
public bus transport between rural areas and the health facilities; (iii) lack of gasoline or money for
gasoline for health providers to travel to rural areas; (iv) lack of access to private cars; and (v)
difficulties of traveling long distances in winter.
Affordability and cost. There are several interconnected issues in relation to the cost of
health care to patients and people's ability to pay. One of the key themes emerging is people's
financial difficulty in making payments. Another is confusion and uncertainty about the system for
payments in the health system. There appears to be considerable uncertainty, anxiety and confusion
for patients about what the level of health care costs are likely to be before they visit a doctor or
attend a health care facility. The introduction of medical insurance was one factor in the confusion.
Overall, people appeared to be unaware or uncertain about what was covered by insurance. Other
payment related issues include not knowing what type of doctor they are likely to encounter, whether
and why they need to pay the doctor, and lack of clarity about whether a payment is formal or
informal. Patients believe they can obtain a higher quality of medical services if they have cash.
Payment is seen as increasing quality and choice. While many interviewed are displeased with the
necessity to pay, the majority of them recognize it as an inevitable necessity. Payments are generally
made in kind rather than in cash.
Health care providers. The assessment provided information about where people turn for
health care. A good number of people in the focus groups noted that they are making greater use of
traditional remedies and healers; consulting with friends and family, and that there is a greater
emphasis on self-cure. The participants reported that they generally wait until the condition is serious
before seeking medical care. This corresponds with the observation of doctors and nurses that people
are delaying seeking medical treatment until the condition deteriorates because of cost and access
reasons. The assessment indicates reference to traditional healers and parents is a common and
increasing practice, particularly in the rural areas where access to fornal health care is more
expensive and more difficult.
Quality of service: The focus groups provided insight into a complex set of issues related to
quality of health care. The main points relating to health care quality are: (i) lack of equipment and
drugs in health care facilities; (ii) basic utilities such as power, heating and water supplies are
unreliable or unavailable; (iii) lack of cleanliness of equipment and rooms; and (iv) variable
availability of staff and the quality of care and skill base of the health professionals. Health users and
providers were asked to identify and rank their perception of the positive and negative aspects of
health care provision (Social and Institutional Assessments are available in the Project Files).

a. Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups:
Primary project beneficiaries include health care facility users, doctors, nurses, feldshers, and
other health care staff. These groups participated in the project design in the following ways:
Page 24



*  field visits by the PCU, consultants, and Bank staff to participating oblasts to consult the health
care staff on priorities for project activities, project design options and to test project concepts;
*  focus groups through the social assessment of health facility users and providers to ascertain their
views on problems in the health sector;
*  officials from the oblast health departments and CMIF were consulted on priorities for project
activities, project design options and feasibility of reforms; and
*  officials from the oblast health departments and CMIF participated in several workshops on
project design and contributed to the design of the project.
b. Other key stakeholders:
Other key stakeholder include the MHES, other donors (WHO, USAID, KHF, UN,
UNAIDS) and the World Bank. The stakeholders participated in the project design process through:
*  field visits to participating oblasts by Bank missions to discuss project issues and ascertain the
level of commitment of the local authorities;
*  a collegium was held during the pre-appraisal mission to discuss proposed project design and
issues and the draft preparation report;
*  donor meetings have been held at the start of preparation, during pre-appraisal and appraisal;
*   a workshop was carried out in April 1998 to review the final preparation report. Participants
included MHES, CMIF, oblast and fund health authorities, the School of Public Health, the
Scientific Center of Medical and Economic Problems of Health, and the Republican Medical
College;
*  WVHO participated in the pre-appraisal mission; and
*  WHO and USAID participated in the appraisal mission and will cofinance three components of
the project.
F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
The project will have a number of incremental recurrent cost implications for the health
budgets including: (i) maintenance of the rehabilitated buildings; (ii) maintenance of equipment; (iii)
replacement of the equipment; and (iv) costs of pharmaceuticals. In order for the reforms to be
sustainable, the Ministry and the oblasts would need to consider alternatives to finance these costs.
The maintenance of buildings and existing equipment are incurred regardless of the project, however
in recent years little has been spent in this area. The costs of maintaining the building rehabilitated
under the project will be lower than in the past because the backlog of repair needs would be reduced.
Spending will have to rise from most recent years but assuming straight-line growth and GDP growth
per annum of three percent per year, this would be feasible. Given the assumptions regarding
economic growth (after the year 2000), the health budget is expected to grow in the coming years and
could absorb expected expenses. Another option to cover the expenses will be additional charging
for services. Possible areas for user fees could be (i) self-referrals to hospitals; (ii) expansion of
existing private charge departments in hospitals; (iii) a nominal daily charge or co-pay for inpatient
care; and (iv) food and supplies in day care settings. A third potential source of savings would be to
implement a more aggressive closure of facilities. While the number of beds has been reduced by
about 40 percent during the period 1993-97, significant savings could be generated by closing
underutilized hospitals that may have high fixed and recurrent costs. Decisions on facility
rationalization and closure will be developed on an annual basis through the work programs.

Annex 1B
Health Reform Program
Phase 1, 2 and 3 of the Adaptable Program Loan
The Health Reform program seeks to support the government to implement a long-term health
restructuring strategy. It is based on the government's Letter of Development Program, which
addresses key elements of the health policy agenda defined in the State Program - Health of the Nation.
Phase One (the Project)
At the national level:
* Implementation of a TB control program in close collaboration with WHO and USAID
* Health Promotion in collaboration with WHO
* Health Policy Evaluation
* Clinical Training Centers for GPs
At the Oblast level to be implemented in Almaty and East Kazakhstan oblasts:
* Primary Health Care (PHC)
* Financial and Management Strengthening in close collaboration with USAID
* Hospital Rationalization and Rehabilitation (HR)
In addition, the project will support the operations of the Project Coordination Unit in the Committee of
Health of the Ministry of Health, Education and Sports and two regional coordination units within the
two oblast administrations.
Phase Two
*  Expansion of Primary Health Care, Financial and Management Strengthening and Hospital
Rationalization to Astana and Almaty cities and to six additional oblasts to be selected on
the basis of criteria agreed upon between the Government and the Bank
*  Reform of GP training to include both the retraining of specialized doctors for general
practice currently included in the PHC Component and the training of GPs to be done in
the medical higher education institutions and post graduate institutes. This will entail
revising the medical curricula to include GP training at the undergraduate level. Training
of GPs in the medical academies, who would then service as the core service providers, is
critical step to developing a primary based medical system. In addition to curricula
development, this activity would need to include clinical training sites, internship programs
for the trained GPs and development of structure for GPs in the Kazakhstan medical
system. Preparation of this component will be initiated with financing from the British
Know How Fund.
Phase Three
* Expansion of the Primary Health Care, Health and Management Strengthening and
Hospital Rationalization to the rest of the country.

Annex 2
Health Reform Program
Project Description
The Health Reform Program seeks to support the Government to implement a long-term
health restructuring strategy. It is based on the Government's Letter of Development Program
(Annex 3), which addresses key elements of the health policy agenda defined in the Health of the
Nation Program, approved by Parliament and the President on November 16, 1998. An Adaptable
Program Loan (APL) is believed to be the appropriate instrument to use for this rapidly developing
transition economy since it provides flexibility on the one hand and assures consistency of policies on
the other. In addition, it provides the opportunity to adapt to evolving priorities within the agreed
framework of the overall program and to adjust at the end of each phase, based on the practical
experience of that phase. The program will encompass three parts phased over seven years that will
seek to support the implementation of the program nationwide. The first phase which is described in
this document
The purpose of the program is to achieve a health system where health care providers are
rewarded for quality and efficiency; patients select their own primary health care doctor of choice;
health services are provided by restructured financing mechanisms to support cost-efficient outpatient
care and payments based on services provided; and continuous progress is made on priority health
status targets. Progress towards this objectives will contribute to the improved welfare of the
Kazakhstan population as measured by gains in health status and public satisfaction with the health
system. The development objectives for Phase I (current project) are regional and national in scope.
The Project is part of the Health Program, the objective of which is to achieve a sustainable
performance-oriented health system, through: (a) modernization and improvement of the quality and
efficiency of the health care system at the national level; and (b) (i) implementation of integrated
health reform; (ii) strengthening of the quality and cost effectiveness of primary health care (PHC);
and (iii) improvement of financing and management capacity at service delivery level in East
Kazakhstan and Almaty oblasts. See Annex IA for complete list of objectives, inputs and indicators.
At the oblast level, Phase I would be implemented in East Kazakhstan Oblast (283,300 km2,
population: 1.64 million) and Almaty Oblast (224,200 km2, population: 1.66 million). During project
preparation these oblasts were merged with neighboring oblasts, Semipalatinsk with East Kazakhstan
and Taldykorgan with Almatyl. The project would support reforms throughout the four "former"
oblasts (about 20% of the national population). Oblasts were selected by the government for their
diversity, experience with health reform; willingness and readiness of local providers to reform; and
strength of leadership in the oblast. Oblasts differ in size, economic base, health conditions and
status, and population composition.  Lessons from  the implementation of the oblasts' level
components will help guide the Government's efforts to strengthen primary health care services and
financial and management in the country at large with support from Phase II and III of the program.
An outline of activities to be included in Phases I, II, and III of the Health Reform Program is
included in Annex IA. Passage from Phase I to II and from II to III would be determined on the
basis of analyses by the Borrower and the Bank of implementation performance. Triggers indicators
for Phases II and III of the APL are presented in Annex 1 B.
Alnaty Oblast does not include the former capital city of Almaty. While some training and other activities will take place
in Almaty City, no facilities at the city level are included in the project.
Page 37



To meet the objectives, the proposed project will have four nation wide and three regional
components. The national components include: (1) Tuberculosis Control, (2) Health Promotion, (3)
Health Policy and Evaluation, and (4) Clinical Training Centers for GPs. The regional components
are: (5) Primary Health Care (PHC); (6) Facility Rationalization and Rehabilitation; and (7 Financial
and Management Strengthening. In addition, the project will support a project management structure
at the national and regional levels to coordinate activities and manage the program.
(1) Tuberculosis Control Component US$9.47 million (total project costs). Tuberculosis (TB)
programs currently in place in Eastern Europe and the NIS are outdated and expensive, using inadequate
non-standardised treatment regimens, with no supervision strategies and low cure rates, thereby
producing drug resistant disease. The TB activities in Kazakhstan are no exception. The TB
notification rate was 101.4 cases per 100,000 population in 1997. This rate compares unfavourably with
rates in Europe (average rate in 1997 was about 44.8 per 100,000). In 1996, mortality from TB was
very high. Deaths happened in young adults, the most economically active age group. With outdated
management structures, the current control program is unable to respond to any new challenges, such as
HIV, which might spread in the next few years, and multi-drug resistant TB, which is probably already
spreading due to lack of essential drugs, inadequacies of treatment regimens, and a high treatment
default rate.
The overall goal of the TB component is to improve tuberculosis control in the country. This
component will be implemented in close collaboration with other donors such as USAID, which has
been providing support for TB control. The project will support nationwide two specific objectives:
(a) reduce the risk of TB transmission in the community and TB morbidity and mortality. The project
will aim at improving treatment, providing standardized short course chemotherapy to patients with
infectious TB, to achieve a reduction of the infection rate in the population; and (b) strengthen policy
reform and improve program management to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness of TB
control activities. The project will aim at a better integration of TB control with the primary health
care system.
The project will revitalize the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) by providing support for
program implementation to the existing central unit (the Kazakh Tuberculosis Research Institute
(KTRI)), oblast, and rayon structures and to primary health care services nationwide. The component
will support the following activities to be implemented during the four years of project implementation
of Phase 1 of the Program.
*  Expansion, improvement and provision of tuberculosis diagnostic services and upgrading the
quality of bacteriological services at the rayon level.
*  Increased provision of anti-TB medicines and other treatment services to TB cases.
*  Improvement of case management by the adoption of the WHO recommended recording and
reporting system and adequate supervision.
Institutional strengthening of tuberculosis control will include the following elements:
*  Strengthening a formal NTP and, under its leadership, guaranteeing operational support to the
three levels of tuberculosis care, i.e., oblast, rayon and primary health care. The central unit
of the NTP, should have adequate staff responsible for formulating, supervising and
enforcing national tuberculosis control policies.
*  Reorganizing and upgrading the Oblast level of the NTP within the Oblast tuberculosis
dispensary to plan, manage and supervise activities conducted within the oblast.
*  Reorganizing and upgrading the rayon level of the NTP in each rayon in order to plan,
manage and supervise control activities within the PHC system.

(2) Health Promotion Component - US$2.88 million (total project cost). Cardio-vascular
disease has been the leading cause of death for many years, followed by cancers, and respiratory
diseases, with diseases of the digestive system and traumatic injuries further down the list. These
diseases are largely preventable, have an enormous cost in personal, social and economic termns, and
are determined by a number of specific factors. These include tobacco smoking, excess consumption
of alcohol, an unhealthy diet and too little physical exercise. Their determinants are typical
economic, social, psycho-social, and environmental factors, including the effects of dangerous
industries on their employees and the general population, through damage to the wider environment.
From international experience, successful prevention can be achieved by addressing the specific
determinants, and tackling a number of key structural, institutional and professional issues. High
level of education are essential to successful health promotion, making Kazakhstan well-placed to
take advantage of such a strategy. Health promotion in Kazakhstan needs substantial modernization,
but this cannot be achieved over night. Health promotion has been identified as one of seven priority
areas outlined in the October 1997 President's address - Kazakhstan 2030. Public information and
education on healthy lifestyles is limited, but is rapidly acquiring importance with the new direction
given by the President. An intersectoral Health Promotion Council has been created to develop a
health promotion action plan with the newly created National Center for Health Promotion, acting as
secretariat. Five areas are included under the component:
(i) National Health Promotion Action Plan. The project will complement efforts initiated
with technical assistance from UN/WHO for the preparation of an inter-sectoral health promotion
action plan. The project will finance further development, publication, and dissemination of the
action plan. The plan will promote the concept of a multi-sectoral action for health, by ensuring that
all sectors adopt health improvement as a specific objective of their programs and that clear
mechanisms are established for intersectoral collaboration for health. The Plan will set clear
objectives, targets and timetables for implementation with clear and agreed programs of work and
responsibilities of different sectors and levels of society. The plan will identify indicators for
monitoring and evaluation. Its implementation will be systematically reviewed and modified in the
light of evaluation. The Plan is being prepared on the basis of a wide consultation process. Funding
will be available through the project for technical assistance, study tours, a national conference and
publication and dissemination of the draft and final action plan.
(iU) Baseline and Follow-up Surveys on Healthy Lifestyle Indicators. To support the
development, monitoring, and evaluation of the Action Plan, baseline surveys of health promotion
indicators and lifestyles would be undertaken. The project will finance baseline surveys of a national
representative sample of 5000 adults, and a national representative sample of 3000 adolescents.
Funding will be available for the field survey and analysis of the results.
(iii) Professional Development and Competence Building. To support the development and
implementation of the Action Plan, professional development and competence building will be
provided for a wide range of health and communication professionals. This will be done through
training and support to the National Center for Health Promotion, the School of Public Health, health
journalists, primary health care providers in Almaty and East Kazakhstan oblasts, and support for the
creation of the network of "Health Promoting Schools Project". The project will finance training,
study tours, and translation, and promotion of key health promotion texts.
(iv) Public Education and Communication Campaign. Many mass media opportunities
using radio, television and newspaper need to be effectively and creatively taken up in promoting the
Action Plan, with an emphasis on tobacco; this work calls for cross-sectoral activity. One of the most
important challenges to the public health education component will be its assistance in the
development of communication messages and a strong health communication network which is made
Page 39



up of public health professionals, and experts from newspapers, radio, and TV at the central and
oblast levels. The aim will be to provide a strategic, less medicalized, appealing health promotion,
drawing on the skills of experts who are in touch with medical trends and replicable and successful
experiments of other countries in the region.  The project will finance technical assistance,
development of printed materials, and broadcast programs and the production of printed materials
including, posters and leaflets, as a direct support to the State Program Health of the Nation. The
Government will provide media advertising space, radio and television broadcast and advertising
time.
(v) National Alcohol and Tobacco Action Plans. Action on alcohol and tobacco is one of
the priority areas of the October 1997 President Address. The State Program - Health of the People
calls for action to regulate the access to and sale of alcohol and tobacco, including prohibit
advertisement, introduction of additional excise duty, and prohibit smoking in public places. This
activity, will support directly the Government's efforts under the State Program. A committee will be
set up with the Ministry of Health, Education and Sports acting as secretariat. The coordinating
committee should be inter-sectoral in composition and consist of representatives of relevant
government ministries, including the Ministries of Finance and Justice, the Agency for Strategic
Planning and Reform, the media, NGOs, and professional associations, as well as lawyers and
educators. The committee will have responsibility for developing and implementing action plans on
alcohol and tobacco, taking into account gender perspectives. It will have specific targets and
timetables for implementation. In order for the action plans to be effective, comprehensive alcohol
and tobacco control measures need to be adequately funded. It is proposed that a portion of alcohol
and tobacco taxes or a special levy on alcohol and tobacco products be used to fund activities.
Activities will include implementation and monitoring of alcohol and tobacco control measures,
education about the hazards of alcohol and tobacco and other initiatives for health purposes,
including the implementation of effective programs for reducing alcohol consumption and smoking
cessation by primary health care providers and meeting the costs of relevant sponsorship of arts and
sporting events.  Funds will be available for technical assistance, organization of a national
conference on alcohol and tobacco, publication and marketing of the action plans, and translation and
promotion of key alcohol and tobacco texts.
(3) Health Policy and Evaluation Component - US$1.31 million (total project cost). Health
program evaluation, including project monitoring, is an integral part of health reform, influencing
policy changes and the reform planning cycle. Evaluation and dissemination of reform efforts to
other oblasts will provide valuable assistance to the Government to formulate policy and plan future
health reforms in the country. The experience of systemic health program evaluation in Kazakhstan
is limited. There have been many reform efforts in the health sector, but the Government has not
undertaken objective, quantitative analyses of these reforms in order to make informed decisions
about their continuation or expansion. A number of surveys related to health care in Kazakhstan,
such as the 1995 Demographic and Health Survey, have been conducted in recent years. While such
surveys are useful to analyze the general health situation at a point in time, they do not measure
change resulting from a particular project. This component is multi-faceted and it seeks to (i)
strengthen the Ministry's overall capacity to evaluate reform programs; (ii) monitor the effects of this
project; (iii) train managers and oblast health officials about data collection and analysis for their own
decision making process; (iv) update the clinical information data in the country; and (v) affect policy
changes through evidence based medicine and evaluation of reforms.
The Scientific Center of Medical and Economic Problems of Health Care (the Center), which
is otherwise not involved in the project, would be responsible for the implementation of this
component. The Center is associated with the MHES but has the autonomy necessary to conduct
evaluation tasks. A Technical and Evaluation Unit (TEU) will be established within the institute
Page 40



specifically to handle the activities of the project. The TEU will be staffed with a full-time person
from the Center and additional staff from the Center would be assigned as needed for
implementation. Technical assistance will be provided to the TEU, possibly in the form of a
partnership with an international institution.
The TEU will have responsibility.for monitoring of key performance indicators to be agreed
upon during negotiations. Progress on these indicators will be submitted to the PCU for inclusion in
quarterly and annual reports. At the start of implementation, baseline data would need to be
collected. In addition to monitoring of these indicators, the TEU will also be responsible for further
analysis of changes in health statistics resulting from the project.
The TEU will be responsible for training of RCU and facility staff on the indicators and data
collection needs. In this training the focus will be on assisting the RCU and facility staff to
understand the usefulness of such data for their own management rather than just a collection
exercise. Managers of health facilities will be trained to collect data on utilization, physician time
and costs in order to make better informed decisions for the operation of new PHC Centers. Helping
the facilities to understand how they can use the data will help guarantee the integrity of the data
presented to the TEU and help the facility managers to develop their own evaluation skills. The TEU
will also be responsible for conducting operational research activities in support of evaluation needs.
The project will also support updating of the clinical information in the country through the
purchase of new medical journals, textbooks and establishing internet connections at medical
institutes and libraries. The project will help develop a franework for using and testing this new
information and the development of a process for evaluating and adapting medical protocols. Funds
will be made available under the project for the TEU to develop and track, with the help of the
facilities, details on utilization, costs and other factors. Funds have also been included for user
surveys, focus groups, training, technical assistance in both project evaluation and medical
information, journals and publications, and establishment of internet connections.
(4) Clinical Training Centers Component - US$2.55 million (total project cost). This component
will establish clinical training facilities for general practitioner training at the country's medical and
post-graduate medical institutes. The concept of general practice has been newly adopted as part of
the health reform process and remains in the early stages of implementation. This has two main
thrusts, the re-education of the existing pool of medical specialists and the commencement of training
of general practitioners at undergraduate level. The latter will be more fully implemented under
phase 2 of the APL. Preparation work to develop the component will be undertaken with fmancing
from the British Know How Fund. The first thrust is a short to medium term approach to fulfill the
country's needs for general practitioners, while the second is a longer term development aimed at
creating a new generation of GPs, imbued with its concept from their commencement of their
training. The component seeks to establish a clinical training facility for all those undergoing basic
training as GPs which will be akin to the practice environment in which they will function. These
facilities will be associated with the medical and post-graduate institutes responsible for GP training
and the training there will form an integral part of their overall training experience. In establishing
these training centers the project will undertake some refurbishing of appropriate premises and equip
them with modern teaching aides and medical equipment necessary for general practice. Each
institution will be provided with a minubus type vehicle.
(5) Primary Health Care Component - US$21.89 million (total project cost). This component
seeks to assist the development of primary health care through general practitioners (GPs) supported
by ancillary staff working in well equipped and supplied surroundings. The project will complement
the establishment of clinical training centers (under component 4) by financing a program of
Page 41



continuing medical education to upgrade skills in a continuos basis and introduce new concepts of
medical care and case management. Training will be extended to the paramedical staff associated
with PHC complexes, including nurses, laboratory technicians and feldshers. This component will
have the following elements:
(i) General Practitioner Training. In addition to physically establishing clinical training
centers nationally, the actual training activities to be supported by the project adopts a cascade
approach, developing a cadre of trainers at the two Medical Institutes in Almaty City and
Semipalatinsk where departments of Family Practice have been established. It is envisaged that these
departments will be strengthened through the addition of staff who will receive appropriate training.
Initially, about five persons from each medical institute will undertake a three-week study tour
overseas to gain understanding about the approaches and requirements for general practice. These
individuals will constitute the core training staff under the Family Practice Department with the future
responsibility for training additional trainers and providing overall guidance to the program. In
parallel, the project will support a two-week study tour of policy makers with a view of strengthening
understanding of this aspect of the reform process and to ultimately enhance the quality of policy
development and decision making. The core training staff will be responsible for training an
additional 22 trainers during a course of two months, thus establishing a cadre of trainers within the
selected oblasts. Additionally, an individual from each medical institute will do a one year residency
program abroad.  The staff will be responsible for training the new general practitioners selected
from the existing medical manpower pool. It is planned that about 400 such GPs will undertake this
training during the life of the project. Their courses will be conducted as eight-week intensive
courses, with the option of undertaking this training through a modular course consisting of four two-
week sessions, to be followed by continuous medical education (CME) during the next two years to
ensure that the skill and knowledge base of the practitioners is maintained and enhanced. This will
entail organizing short courses on specific relevant subjects such as the Integrated Management of
Childhood Illness (IMCI). It is expected that each GP will receive about five days of CME each year.
It is anticipated that much of the CME program will be conducted in hospital facilities at the rayon
level.
In addition to retraining of therapists, pediatricians and others as general practitioners, the
project will also support the Government's program for undergraduate training of general practice
which is being treated as a specialty after an initial common three-year period of training for all
potential medical graduates. This activity will be closely coordinated with the Know How Fund
which has provided support to help establish: (i) an outline curricula training of GPs, (ii) curricula for
retraining specialized doctors as GPs, and (iii) a cadre of six postgraduate GP trainers and eight
undergraduate family medicine trainers. The reinstitution of an internship following the basic
training is at present under consideration by the authorities.
The program will be supported by technical assistance and some material support. It is
proposed that a single institution will provide a package of technical assistance to address the training
program needs. The technical assistance will collaborate with the training organizers to determine
training needs, plan courses, determine content of overseas tours and visits, and define selection
criteria for training participants. Much of the technical assistance will be directed to assuring the
quality of the training for the core trainers, assuring that they will be competent to take on the task of
preparing general practitioners for their new role. International expertise will be closely involved
with course teaching and evaluation. Twelve months of technical assistance will be provided to the
two medical institutes and covering the training of trainers courses during project implementation.
Technical assistance will also be made available to launch the CME program. Material support will
include a microbus for each medical institute, teaching equipment and some medical equipment for
Page 42



each teaching establishment including the family practice groups under the medical institutes and at
new training sites in Taldykorgan and Ust-Kamenogorsk.
(ii) Paramedical Training. The project will assist the strengthening of existing programs.
Specifically, it will finance short courses for nurses, laboratory technicians and feldshers with the aim
to sustain and upgrade their skills and knowledge, targeting the areas included in the project. The
training will be under the four medical colleges, two in each oblasts, and will be conducted both at
the college and at selected rayon hospitals. Training of trainers for this program will be supported by
technical assistance and study tours while training facilities will be supported through the supply of
teaching equipment and materials.
(iii) Service Delivery. The formation and development of financially independent and fully
accountable Primary Health Care Centers (PHCC) is a key feature of the project. Each PHCC will
comprise one SVA and between two and four FAPs2 covering about 6,000 persons depending on
population density and facility spread. Experimentation with such centers has already taken place in
Semipalatinsk and the project will build on this experience. By giving the PHCCs financial
autonomy, incentives for efficiency and quality improvement will also be introduced. Establishment
of these PHCCs is expected to strengthen relations between the SVAs and FAPs and lead to improved
provision of health services. Such centers will be developed in rural as well as urban areas. In the
latter case, they will be established either within existing polyclinics or as separate entities, and
provide family-based care.
While it is necessary in such settings to deal with the problems as presented by patients,
nevertheless, stress would be placed on dealing with priority diseases since the interventions are
particularly cost effective. The priority diseases include tuberculosis (see below), childhood diseases
including acute respiratory infections and diarrhea disease, viral hepatitis, anemia in women of child-
bearing age, sexually transmitted diseases, diabetes and hypertension. Between rayons, priorities will
differ and, for instance, sexually transmitted disease problems are going to be more significant in the
urban setting. A series of inputs would be made to improve and strengthen the PHCCs ability to
deliver appropriate and publicly acceptable services. These include:
(a) Civil Works. A detailed physical survey of facilities has been undertaken to elicit the
building requirements to bring rayon hospitals and PHCC buildings to an acceptable standard. Based
on this survey, average costs have been estimated for each type of facility and allocations made based
on the number of facilities.
(b) Equipment. The lack of adequately functioning basic medical and laboratory equipment
plays a role in the poor utilization of facilities, including increased referrals and admissions to
secondary facilities. The project will provide basic equipment to SVAs and FAPs reflecting their
staffing, roles and capacities. Most items are relatively simple, requiring little maintenance and
incurring little recurrent expenditure. The majority of the staff will be familiar with most of the
equipment, but the project will provide relevant training to familiarize staff in the use of new
equipment.
(c) Pharmaceuticals. An annual supply of essential supplies covering the priority diseases
and emergency medicines will be financed by the loan, on a declining basis. The possibility of the
2SVAs and FAPs are part of the old Soviet service delivery model; SVAs are rural ambulatory centers and FAPs are feldsher
posts.
Page 43



PHCCs to identify and purchase their own drug requirements will be considered once their fund-
holding capacity is established.
(d) Communications. The project will improve the communication capabilities through
restoration of telephone systems in facilities where they previously existed.
(e) Information Systems. Development and relative independence of PHCCs will require
them to improve their management capacity and information systems for planning and reporting.
Once training has been completed the system would be used to maintain patient records,
correspondence and PHCC accounts.
(6) Financial and Management Strengthening Component - US$2.99 million (total project cost).
The project will strengthen both the primary care and secondary (hospital) sector through a series of
financing and management reforms to enhance revenues and create more efficient use of available
resources. The strategy and pace in each oblast may vary depending upon local preferences and
historic experience with reforms, but will follow a general framework. Funds from the oblast budget
revenues and the employer payroll tax would be pooled within each of the participating oblasts. The
benefit package will be streamlined, to integrate all health care, except for some specialized referral
services such as blood banks and psychiatric care. Providers of services will have more legal
autonomy. There are two element to this component:
(i) Primary Care. A number of changes to be supported by the project will assure delivery
organization and restructuring to re-focus care towards family and general practice. As described
under the PHC component, in rural areas, the old Soviet hierarchy will be restructured through the
creation of PHCs that will incorporate a SVA and several FAP stations to serve a population of about
6000 people. Individuals and families will enroll in these PHCs, and may have some limited choice
of physician, depending upon the size of the PHC. The PHC centers will:
* receive a capitation payment, based on a population formula that will adjust for
demographics and possible other factors. The capitation payment will initially cover only
primary care services, but progressively over time include more services (e.g., specialty
referrals and " partial fundholding" of discretionary inpatient care) by the end of the project;
*  receive independent juridical status, and in the process be empowered to revise staffing
levels, patterns of care and expenditure relative to the old Soviet normatives, such as the 18-
line item expenditure rules;
*  develop physician bonus systems and contracting processes for promoting good performance
by staff. This bonus system will be used for incentive payments to primary care physicians
to reward cost-reducing behavior and an expanded level of service. Payments will enable
doctors to increase their compensation putting them closer to the levels received by
physicians in hospitals. The incentive payments will be earned as a result of performance
and not used simply to increase salaries. The loan will finance an initial sum of money for
the pool and the pool will replenished from cost-savings: Precise mechanism and conditions
for management and disbursement of funds from the bonus system will be worked out during
the first. year of implementation.
* report spending on a quarterly basis according to an annually approved business plan;
* develop basic and standardized MIS systems that will track information related to
administrative needs, clinical care and expenditures, and allow comparisons across centers
and across time; and
* utilize practice managers, who will be trained in using information for management purposes,
comparing and profiling best practices, and feeding information back to physicians in the
PHCs.

In urban areas, PHC centers will be constituted from groups of general physicians or primary
care sub-specialties (e.g., pediatricians, obstetrician/gynecologists) within urban polyclinics. These
groups will compete for patients on the basis of open enrollment and will be paid in a way similar to
rural PHCs. The new principle of choice of doctor will be established through information
campaigns and open enrollment periods. Organizationally, the PHC centers will be separated
administratively, financially, and (in some cases) physically from the polyclinic and polyclinic-based
specialists.
(ii) Secondary or Hospital Care. As described under the Facility Rationalization and
Rehabilitation Component, annual plans will be developed to close, downsize and consolidate the
current excess capacity of inpatient care. Project funds will be available to upgrade and integrate
services at selected facilities, such as the central rayon hospital which serves as an area wide referral
center. At the same time, criteria such as physical condition, capacity, expected utilization, and
redundancy of staffing/services will be used to identify unneeded beds and facilities, and develop re-
structuring plans. This rationalization strategy will both save revenues and improve the quality of
care delivered as services are integrated within general care facilities.  The planning and
rationalization strategy will be complemented by restructuring incentives for more efficient care.
Hospitals will move from old 18-line item budgets to new performance-based per admission payment
systems. The systems will adjust for case-mix, using relatively simple systems of 50-150 categories
now being implemented in other regions of Kazakhstan (e.g., Dzheskazgan oblast) and other
countries in Central Asia. Hospitals will begin by having one price paid per clinical department for
each admission. Over time, cost data and clinical diagnostic data will be assessed by expert teams to
develop more refined case-mix groupings. The PHC centers will be encouraged to promote
contracting and have open referral for inpatient services, creating competition across hospitals and
thus incentives for efficient care.  Quality assurance systems will be introduced to track
appropriateness of services and referrals.
Training and technical assistance will equip providers and facilities to manage care and
resources in the new environment, to use MIS and contracting management tools, and to integrate
quality assurance and quality improvement systems to help balance quality and efficiency in the
delivery of services. New, but nominal, co-payments will be introduced, both to generate revenues at
the local level for addressing local concerns, and to encourage more appropriate use of services and
settings of care. The great majority of copayments will be maintained by the local practice or facility.
(7)  Facility Rationalization and Rehabilitation Component - US$4.68 million (total project
cost). The Government has moved ahead in the rationalization process by closing a significant
number of beds, and facilities, especially in rural areas. However, the next stage, which is to
rationalize functions within hospitals and aggregate smaller facilities under one roof is more complex.
The component will support and expand the Government's efforts by promoting the merging of urban
and smaller specialized facilities under one roof to improve quality of care and generation of
significant savings. A reconfiguration of physical facilities has quality enhancing benefits. Merged
facilities can make more intensive use of support facilities such as operating theaters and laboratories.
Staffing and equipment of these facilities can be used more effectively and best equipment
concentrated in a smaller number of sites. In addition, as resources and service provision are shifted
to the primary care sector, the hospital sector will be rationalized directly through targeted
rationalization and reorganization of service delivery, and indirectly through incentives created by the
new payment system being introduced under the Financial and Management Strengthening
Component.  The development of a strong PHC sector will lead to a reduction in routine
hospitalization and reduced periods spent in hospital. Improved PHC should also have an impact on
admissions for diseases other than those included in the PHC priority package.  Targeted
rationalization plans to close and reorganize excess facilities will be drawn up by local authorities on
Page 45



an annual basis as part of annual work programs. The rationalization plans should address initial
reorganization, consolidation, closure of facilities, and implementation of a number of cost savings
measures working effectively under rationalization efforts under the Bank-financed Social Protection
Project.
The project will support rationalization measures at the oblast and central rayon hospital
levels. Funds will be available to study options for consolidation of hospitals including technical
assistance for this purpose and for some rehabilitation as needed to combine departments or upgrade
areas in order to close other facilities. Funds will be allocated for oblast level facilities and central
rayon hospitals. The use of these funds will be planned along side rationalization plans in annual
work programs. In addition, project funds will be made available for medical equipment needed as
part of combining and rationalizing facilities for central rayon hospitals. Specifically, the component
will provide assistance to: (i) upgrade rayon hospitals, which by their location, will not be subject to
inclusion in any consolidation program; (ii) efforts to evaluate options for consolidating facilities; (iii)
manage the consolidation phase; and (iv) physically upgrade facilities where necessary to integrate
new functions.
In addition to the seven components described in this annex, the project will finance project
management and coordination arrangements through the Project Coordination Unit and two Regional
Coordination Units being established at the oblast level. The project will finance salaries of foreign
and local consultants, equipment, and part of the operating costs.

Health Reform Program
Mr. Johannes Liunn       Draft Letter of Development Program
Vice President
Europe and Central Asia Region
World Bank
Washington, D.C.
Letter of Development Program
Dear Mr. Linn:
General Background - Health Status
Health conditions in what is today the Republic of Kazakhstan have been do :rioraitng
since the early 1 990s. Ile share of GDP devotcd to health has declined from 6 percent in he
niid-1980s to 2 percent in 1997. Key health indicators show Kazakhstan between those o
established marker economies and middle income countrics, but in general, infant and aduit
mormality rate and life expectancy are better than countrics with comparable levels of p.: capita
income. However, in 1997 life expectancy of women was 70.0 years and for mcn 58.5 yc Irs
conmpared with an average of 73.1 years for wornen and 63.8 years for mca during the p. r,od 1992
to 1997. A slight increase in infant mortality has been registcred over the past few years and
matemal mortality is high by international standards, ranging froin 67.2 to 76.9 per 100,000 live
births duing the 1991-1997 period.
In addition to thesc broad indicators some specific trends also point to a worsciing
health situation. Of special importance is dth rise in the incidence of tuberculosis with an anmial
new case increase of about 20%/', a trend whose origins precede the establish of the Republic.
Similarly, diseases such as hepatitis B have showni an increased prevalence while, recntly, new
problems have emerged such a-s the advent of the human immunu dcficiency virus (IIV). Tnis
worseting cpidermiological situation has complex roots related to the break-up of the formir Soviet
Union and hic difficulties and impact on social and economic conditions of the transition from plan
to market economies. Resources to deal with increasing health naeds have been scarce.
Reform Initiatives
Twh Governinent has taken vigorous steps to deal with the need for improved health
services. A program of tar reaching reforms has been instituted to create a health care system which
is efficient, cost cffective and which may be cxpected to lead to a reversal of curnetit
epidemiological trends.
Page 47

The inherited health care system, characterized by large quantities of inputs, high rates
of hospital use including long inpatient stays and over-supply of physician specialists is being
restructured to redress these problems. Already, significant change has been wrought through: (i)
reduced hospital capacity through a nationwide reduction in staff positions and hospital beds; (ii)
privatization of facilities particularly pharmacies, some polyclinics and hospitals; (iii) merging of
some duplicate health services, and closing of health facilities; and (iv) decrease in admission rates to
hospitals and reduction of length of stays through application of more modem treatment approaches.
There have been substantial reductions in the number of hospitals and ambulatory care facilities over
the last five years (47% reduction in number of public hospitals between 1993-1997, 20% reduction
in number of polyclinics); a parallel reduction in bed numbers (40% decline during the period
1993-97), and staff (16% reduction in number of doctors, 30% reduction in number of nurses) has
also occurred. In addition, the development of a cadre of family physicians to provide primary care
and a restructuring of service facilities to emphasize family practice over a specialty approach to
health care is in its preliminary stages.
Decline in government revenues has meant a reduction in allocation for health as well as
for other sectors. This has meant that we have had to consider alternative ways of financing health
care services and experimentation with co-payment systems, employer-based payroll contributions and
insurance.
Kazakhstan 2030. The President's strategic policy "Kazakhstan 2030" addresses as a
broad policy agenda health, education, and welfare of the population, with special emphasis on: (i)
enhancing healthy lifestyles through improvements in water supply, reducing the number of facilities
polluting the environment and inflicting ecological damage, promoting physical exercise, observing
standards of hygiene and sanitation, avoiding consumption of drugs, and reducing consumption-of
alcohol and tobacco; (ii) improving health of women and children, together with a broad pro-natalist
policy to curb the decline in population; and (iii) improving national standards.
State Program - Health of the Nation. Following the broad strategy outlined in
"Kazakhstan 2030", the Government developed a State Program - Health of the Nation, which was
approved by Parliament and the President on November 16, 1998. The goal of the State Program is to
develop and implement short-term middle-term, and long-term action plans to achieve a new level of
quality health care to improve the health status of the population. The Program sets out our major
objectives to ensure the health protection of the population, ensure advanced level and accessibility of
health care, and improved organization, funding and health care delivery to the population. We attach
great importance to major measures about health protection of the population related to health
promotion, primary health care development, prevention and eradication of TB and other socially
important diseases, as well as improvement of organization, administration, and financing of the health
sector.
Implementation of a comprehensive approach to sectoral needs will require a complex set
of initiatives, many of which have already commenced. This effort will undertake improvements in
health system management and administration, reorganization of the health care delivery system and
changing the system of sectoral financing, reform of the medical education system to produce
primarily family physicians, and improving the technical and managerial capabilities of the sector.
Recent Decrees. The President's Decree of May 18, 1998 dealing with "Priority
Measures for Improvement of Health of People of the Republic of Kazakhstan", the Resolution of
Government No 737 of August 4, 1998 dealing with "Confirmation of Programs and Subprograms
Page 48



of the Ministry of Health, Education and Sports of the Republic of Kazakhstan for the State
budget for 1999 setting up", Resolution of Government No 1387 of December 31, 1998 dealing
with "Compulsory Medical Insurance Fund Reorganization" and more specific Orders (Prikazes)
Nos. 500, 501, 526, 574 issued in 1998 by the Committee of Health dealing with Development of
General/Family Practice and Restructuring of Primary Health Care Facilities, provide directions
and details for the health reform program.
Continued Reform Implementation and the World Bank
To further implement the outlined reform initiatives, we look forward to the close
collaboration and support from the World Bank. The phased approach to support through an
Adjustable Program Loan (APL) best meets the needs of our development program.
In order to support the State Program outlined in this letter, The Government of the
Republic of Kazakhstan is requesting the World Bank to provide a financial facility in an amount
of US$162 million. Within this facility, the Government of Kazakhstan is requesting a loan in an
amount of US$42.5 million to implement the first phase of the Program.
With financial assistance during the first phase of the APL, we will intensify
development of primary health care, undertake further hospital rationalization and strengthen
finance and management capabilities in those areas. At the national level, priority will be given to
an intensive campaign against tuberculosis, strengthening health promotion activities with a
particular focus on smoking and alcohol use, conducting monitoring and evaluation of health
policy, and improving clinical training capability for general practitioners. Experience with the
first phase will also lead to a generally improved capacity to further plan, manage and expand the
reform program.
While implementing the first phase, preparation work will begin for the second
phase of support focussing on medical education and the training of family physicians, intended
to be the key health care providers of the future. The proper education of this next generation of
health care providers is expected to go a long way to ensuring a successful outcome of our reform
program.
Also during phase two, but more intensively in phase three, we will extend
assistance for primary health care to the remaining oblasts, using the experience gained from East
Kazakhstan and Almaty oblasts to refine and further develop a comprehensive technical, physical,
financial and managerial approach to health care reform.
In pursuing our reform agenda, we are also closely working with the World Health
Organization, USAID, and the Know How Fund. We are confident that close collaboration and
coordination of all interested international agencies will support the efforts of the Government of
Kazakhstan and public and private health care providers to meet one of its main policy objectives,
improving the health of the nation.

Annex 4
Health Reform Program
Estimated Project Costs
Summary of Project Costs: Total project costs are estimated at US$49.53 million. Costs
include physical and price contingencies of US$6.08 million or 14% of the total base cost of
US$43.45 million.  The project costs include medical and office equipment and supplies,
pharmaceuticals, training, technical assistance, modest rehabilitation of facilities, and incremental
recurrent costs. Costs by component are shown in Table A.
Basis of Cost Estimates: Project costs were estimated in US dollars. The costs for civil
works, goods (medical and office equipment, pharnaceuticals, supplies, and computers), technical
assistance and training have been estimated based on costs paid in similar projects financed by the
Bank in Kazakhstan and other Former Soviet Union countries. Cost estimates for foreign technical
assistance include fees, travel, housing and subsistence costs and overheads. Base cost estimates
reflect prices in December 1998.
Foreign Exchange Component: The foreign exchange component was estimated as follows:
(a) civil works - 20%; (b) foreign technical assistance and foreign training - 100%; (c) medical
equipment, supplies, pharmaceuticals, computer equipment - 100%; (d) training materials and
supplies - 60%. The foreign exchange component, including contingencies, is estimated US$31.62
million, or 63% of total project costs.
Contingency allowances: Price contingencies on foreign exchange costs are based on
estimated inflation rates of 3.1% for 1999, 2.9% for 2000, 2.8% for 2001, 2.7% for 2002 and 2.6%
for 2003. It is assumed that the rate of exchange will depreciate in step with local inflation. Price
contingencies on local costs (expressed in US dollars) are therefore based on the same international
inflation rates. Physical contingencies were estimated at 15% for civil works and 10% for all
equipment and supplies.
Taxes and Duties: Cost estimates do not include any estimates for taxes and import duties
since the Government has confirmed that it will exempt goods and services financed by the project
from such taxes.
Project Financing: The proposed loan of US$42.5 million will finance 86 percent of total
project costs. The Government will contribute US$5.30 million equivalent to 11 percent of total
project costs. Government contribution will finance a percentage of civil works, rental of office for
the Project Coordination and Regional Coordination Units, salary of counterparts staff in the
participating oblasts, a percentage of pharmaceuticals for PHCCs and a portion of incremental
recurrent costs. USAID will finance US$1.20 million or 2 percent in technical assistance and training
costs associated with the Financial and Management Strengthening Component. In addition, WHO
will finance US$0.53 million or 1 percent in technical assistance and training related to the
Tuberculosis Component and the Health Promotion Component.

Health Reform Program
Economic Analysis
Macro-Economic Context
Since 1990, the economy of Kazakhstan has suffered a deep economic recession that saw real
GDP halved between 1990 and 1994. During the same period, revenues fell by 70 percent; all sectors
have been affected. The GDP per capita in 1994 was $1,440, and was estimated to have bottomed in
1996 at $1,310 (see Table 2).
The medium term prognosis is promising although uncertain, especially in light of the financial
collapse in Russia. The growth in consumer prices has slowed considerably in the last two years as the
effects of price liberalization and the negative impact of recession have worked through the system (see
Table 2). There is negative growth (-1.5 percent) this year, no growth next year, but growth is expected
to be positive in future years, and rising to a rate of around 5 percent by the year 2002. The Government
deficit is expected to fall over the medium term largely due to a continued reduction in public
expenditure rather than increasing tax revenue. Despite these promising signals, growth will be
contingent upon maintaining and expanding reforms across a number of sectors. Growth scenarios in
this analysis assume a steady 3 percent growth in GDP in years 6-20 and are based on the premise that
oil exports will increase significantly with the completion of the Caspian Sea pipeline.
The projected budget for the health sector is not available, but one of the two following
assumptions might be used. First, assuming steady growth as a percentage of GDP or a second
assumption that follows the experience of middle income countries generally with a positive income
elasticity for government health care spending. This analysis uses the first assumption, a conservative
projection. The proportion of the budget devoted to health has remained stable hovering from around 9
to 10 percent since 1989.

Scope of Work
The economic analysis is a cost-benefit analysis and it is limited to an exploration of the
likely effect of the most important elements of the project relating to improvements in primary
health services in two pilot oblasts. It does not yet fully quantify the benefits of supporting a
national strategy for health promotion and improving the clinical information network. It is
based on the investment and recurrent costs of all components over a twenty year period. The
benefits are limited to measurable health sector savings and indirect financial benefits to the
community, together with an exploration of the likely health effect of the most important
Page 55



elements of the project. The complexity of project benefits and means of valuation makes any
attempt to quantify them in one standard unit, monetary or otherwise, extremely difficult and
vulnerable to a wide confidence band. Estimates are hindered by accounting practices that still
diverge from Western practices (e.g., depreciation not included).
Summary of Benefits
All local costs were converted into US dollars. An exchange rate of 85 tenge to one US
dollar is used, representing the exchange rate on the street (commercial rate) at the end of January
1998. Recurrent costs relying largely or exclusively on local labor (e.g., facilities construction, staff
salaries, etc.) were adjusted before converting them to dollars to allow for differences in the local
purchasing power. This was done by using the ratio of $US GDP per capita at market exchange rates
to GDP per capita measured on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), estimated at 1.42.
(a)    Direct Financial Benefits
The project investments in primary care will permit staff to treat a wider range of conditions.
This is expected to have a significant impact on hospital admissions, lengths of stay, number of beds,
and staffing levels. In the preparation report, it was estimated that the admission rate will fall by
between 15 and 17 percent as a consequence. It is also true, however, that improved primary care
may lead to the identification of more disease offsetting some of the reduction in admissions (albeit
for different specialties). The analysis assumes that admissions will fall by a net 10 percent.
It is expected that the economic incentive in the pilot demonstrations will force cut backs in
staff or a more efficient mix of staff. Currently, the Government continues to rely on old Soviet-based
input normnatives for staffing of existing and newly-opened facilities. The project will include legal
changes that will provide local flexibility for hiring and firing of staff, as well as changing the mix of
inputs including personnel. During the preparation, estimates of personnel cut backs were developed for
facility closures and for changes in efficiency only, but still estimated between 271 to 586 per old oblast.
Assumptions for staff reductions are 10 percent in year 1, 20 percent in years 2 and 3, and 25 percent in
years 4 and 5. The savings estimates further assume that 10 percent are lost each year due to natural
attrition; the rest to redundancy. These total staff cut back assumptions are quite conservative and other
analysis (e.g., Uzbekistan) have used estimates based on international comparisons of levels of
productivity (e.g., visits per physician). These estimates showed that over the life of the project,
decreases in levels and types of personnel might be expected to decrease personnel costs by about one-
third.
A second source of savings will come from restructuring and closing of facilities. These vary
across the pilot oblasts. For Almaty and Taldykorgan it is assumed that the strategy for hospital
restructuring follows a reduction in inpatient admissions of 10 percent, a reduction in average length
of stay and merger of the oncology, narcology (Almaty only) and STD dispensary with the main
oblast hospitals.  In East Kazakhstan and Semipalatinsk facility closures are assumed for
tuberculosis (TB) care only. A reduction in admissions of 10 percent at the main general oblast
(children and adult) hospitals is assumed.
The biggest source of savings derives from reduction of tuberculosis beds and facilities
nationwide. Currently, there are a total of 13,707 beds which are located in TB dispensaries (9,165),
TB hospitals (2,345) and specialized TB wards (1,432). There are an undetermined number of
additional beds in TB sanatoria. Using WH[O estimates, the number of new patients to be notified in
2001 and 2002 will be about 40,000 per year, half of them will be infectious (sputum smear positive
cases). Of that number, about 1700 will require admission for about 60 days each on average. This
Page 56



implies a figure of only about 3,400 beds will be needed for TB treatment in Kazakhstan (assuming
equal distribution over the year). An additional reserve of 20% for severely sick non-infectious cases
(like meningitis and military TB) added to 3,400 -- gives a total about 4,000 beds that might be
required. The savings here are assumed to accrue starting in years 6 through 15 of the project,
providing ample time for implementation of new protocols, observation of the impact of the new
reforms, and planning for orderly transition of needed rationalization of facilities. The analysis also
builds in new costs for treatment of TB patients on an outpatient basis (using estimates from studies
in Russia), as a substitute for more expensive inpatient approaches now in use.
The analysis takes account of efficiency savings made at oblast-level hospitals in each oblast.
Savings are also expected as a consequence of raion hospital restructuring and integration of services.
It is envisaged, however, that these hospitals will retain most of these savings for improving the
quality of health care at this level and, thus, these are not included in the financial analysis.
Importantly, it is assumed that the full resource impact will not be felt until several years after the
initiation of the project.
(b)    Indirect Benefits
A complete economic analysis must take account of these direct impacts and the wider
benefits on society. There are at least two main categories of community benefits to consider:
indirect financial benefits, and non-financial (health) benefits. Indirect financial benefits included in
this analysis are productivity savings and travel time/cost savings.
Productivity Savings. Reducing the length of time each patient remains in hospital will
reduce the productivity losses associated with medical care. The relationship is not direct since some
patients will simply spend more time convalescing at home. To the extent that patients spend less
time waiting for treatment or in hospital receiving post-operative treatment that they could obtain as
an ambulatory patient, this will result in a direct productivity saving. For this analysis, it is estimated
20 percent of the bed day saving results in productivity savings. Savings are valued at the average
per capita wage assuming 220 working days per year.
Distance Travel Costs. Improving the standard of outpatient primary care should reduce
costs of traveling to hospital for treatment. The average distance to an oblast hospital was calculated
using a simple formula that assumes that the population is equally distributed throughout the pilot
oblasts. The cost of travel time was obtained by multiplying the hourly productivity loss by an
estimate of the length of time it takes to reach the nearest oblast center. This cost was multiplied by
the reduction in admissions expected from the hospital restructuring. The main assumption is that
patients at the hospital are equally distributed throughout the rayon. This is unlikely to be the case
since patients close to the hospital will probably use the hospital more frequently. Unfortunately no
information is available on their distribution.
Non-Financial (Health) Benefits Available data support the contention that the project's
primary care focus is a cost-effective strategy of addressing the nation's burden of disease. It is difficult
to quantify and then value the health benefits that are likely to accrue from the project. However, the
treatment of each disease in the priority package has the potential to lead to significant reduction in
DALY losses. Table 3 indicates that the interventions that will be promoted through the project should
deliver high benefits for every dollar spent. The impact of the project is well illustrated by using the
treatment of tuberculosis as an example. It is estimated that the oblasts currently spend around 20
percent of their health budget on treatment of this disease. Much of this expenditure is the result of long
lengths of stay in hospital. In both oblasts the inpatient stay for tuberculosis averages about 115 days.
Current spending on tuberculosis in the two oblasts is estimated to be about $8.8 million. Using the
Page 57



average low income country as a baseline for low/no treatment, the cost per DALY gained is currently
$79. Introducing DOTS therapy has the potential to increase the effectiveness of treatment of TB at
relatively low cost. Coupled with new structural incentives for more efficient care (see above), these
new clinical approaches can bring about a more cost-effective delivery system. Treatment of other
diseases such as ARI, CDD, Anemia and other diseases to be promoted through the project provide
similarly high benefits when new clinical practice and parallel incentive structures are implemented.
The health promotion component, through targeted programs aimed at reduction in smoking
and alcohol consumption will help reduce incidence and costs of lung and liver cancers, as well as
cardiopulmonary and cardiovascular problems. Most disease burden is associated with circulatory and
respiratory disorders, and cancers.
Table 3 summarizes the burden of disease (measured in DALYs) for 10 key medical conditions
in Kazakhstan. These 10 conditions are among those targeted for expanded primary care capability in
the PHCs and constitute a significant (approximately half) of the entire DALY burden. (Note that the
morbidity portion of the tabulations depends on data which for Kazakhstan are not highly reliable, and
probably underestimate the global burden of disease.). The rural primary care program effectively
targets the largest sources of disease burden. Moreover, these conditions are amenable to well-
established, cost-effective prevention activities and primary curative treatment. The last column in
Table 3 summarizes the cost per DALY saved of primary care activities developed from reviews of
empirical literature. The standard suggested by World Bank analysts (Jamison et al., 1993) is under
$250 per DALY saved. There are interventions meeting this standard in every disease category, most
are rated as under $50. Given a goal of reducing disease burden in Kazakhstan, the primary care
strategy can be an effective way of stretching scarce health care budgets relative to traditional Soviet
models which placed allocations disproportionately with specialists and expensive, hospital-based care.

Although data to develop cost-effectiveness ratios using parameters specific to Kazakhstan are
not available, all indications are that the operating cost of health facilities in Kazakhstan (as with the rest
of Central Asia) are low. The project can lead to eventual reductions in morbidity and (longer-term)
mortality which, from a human capital point of view, will increase the economic value of people living
in the area. In addition, in the case of some diseases such as hepatitis and tuberculosis, investment also
has public good properties as it limits the spread of these communicable diseases. In effect the
investment reduces the negative externalities of disease contraction.
(c)    Long-Term Benefits
The Government's PHC program is intended to be tested in the two participating oblasts, before
it is implemented nation-wide. The Committee of Health intends to learn from the experience of the
participating oblasts to improve primary care elsewhere. The program thus has the major advantage of
providing a window for testing, learning, and for dissemination.
The training and clinical information network sub-components are a particularly good example
of this. Funding includes investments for training and continued flows of new information on clinical
practice and quality of care. The project will provide the first step for nation-wide capacity to train
primary care physicians. While, in principle, investment in training depreciates over time, investments
in this part of the project are devoted to building future training capacity.
The health promotion component can generate new revenues, for example, through new taxes
on alcohol and tobacco. The component will develop National Action Plans for both tobacco and
alcohol. For tobacco, the cross-country comparisons indicate a negative price elasticity of around 0.5
for tobacco, suggesting both new revenues and fewer smokers. The economic incentives and
Page 59



informational campaigns that yield behavioral changes might further translate into short-term gains in
productivity in the workplace (e.g., fewer sick days), and longer-term can be expected to have
significant impacts on morbidity and mortality of both men and women.
In comparable Bank-financed projects in Georgia and Estonia, health promotion gains for
tobacco alone were estimated as 15 percent annual reductions after Year 5 of the project, in terms of
incidence of mortality and morbidity for adult men from cardiovascular and lung diseases (e.g.,
COPD, ischemic heart disease, and lung cancer). Estimates for women were much lower, the most
significant being lung cancer at 1 percent. If this project assumes only 10 percent impacts in lowered
mortality for men in these disease categories, that would translate into substantial numbers of DALYs
saved and associated savings generated through increased wages and income. Using DALY loss
numbers in Table 3 for cardiovascular and circulatory diseases, and assuming impacts are evenly
distributed, there would be over 60,000 life years saved. These DALY savings might account for as
much as $11.15 million (before discounting) in workforce wage income over the life of the project, if
impacts are evenly distributed. (This number assumes 47 percent of the population is part of the
workforce and that 55 percent of the average life years is spent in productive economic gain.) The
component also includes a Health Promoting Schools Project. The 1993 WDR measured the
effectiveness of school-based health programs at $38-43 per DALY.
At the same time, DALYs saved will mean higher health costs due to longer life-spans and
more encounters with the medical care delivery system. These additional costs will offset overall
savings, especially if encounters occur more frequently in individuals over 60 years of age who tend
to be 2-3 times as costly as those under 60 years of age, on average. Even with these costs, net gains
might be expected.
Nevertheless, the ability of the Govermnent to influence behavior is highly uneven as is seen
in contrasting impacts in (say) the United States versus France. Because the interventions are
difficult to model at this point, and because these impacts -- revenue gains, workforce productivity
gains, and increases in expected years of life - also are difficult to estimate, these are not formally
included in the economic analysis.
Finally, the evaluation, dissemination, and policy research component will allow
development of better and more timely data, and improved efforts to assess costs and benefits,
leading to better information for improved policy development and decision making.
Summary of Costs
For the purposes of the analysis several assumptions are built into the cost analysis:
*  Resources devoted by the Government to health care grow at the same rate as the economy
(around 3 percent per year starting in the year 2000);
*  Expenditure on salaries and medicines grow at the same rate as the economy. Salaries of health
staff are already relatively low, and it is important that their real value is increased in order to
provide realistic incentives. International experience suggests that expenditure on medicines
grows at least as fast as economic activity as technologies of treatment advance;
*  Debts on fuel currently in the country are paid off with health sector funds. Actual expenditure
on fuel is around 25 percent below what is actually required. It is, therefore, assumed that
expenditure increases with growth in health sector resources until it is 25 percent above real
current expenditure;
Page 60



* Expenditures on maintenance of current investments increases to nearly 10 percent of the budget.
Current levels of maintenance (only one percent of the budget) are inadequate to maintain the
existing building stock.
(a)    Incremental Recurrent Costs
The project has a number of incremental recurrent cost implications. These include:
*  maintenance of the rehabilitated buildings;
*  maintenance of equipment;
*  replacement of the equipment, which will occur for most equipment during the paying off period
of the loan; and
*  cost of providing pharmaceuticals.
The maintenance of buildings is estimated at an annual rate of 1/40 of the value of the
investment in civil works. Some of this could be absorbed within the current maintenance budget of
the oblast, but since maintenance expenditure is currently very low, it is assumed that all maintenance
of project related civil works is incurred as additional cost. Equipment recurrent costs include
maintenance of purchased items together with the expected replacement costs of equipment during
the period of the loan. Some equipment will be replaced after only a few years while other
equipment will last throughout the period of the project. These variable rates of depreciation are
incorporated into the calculations through an analysis of the frequency of replacement of medical
equipment provided to PHC Centers. Figure 1 illustrates the annual cost of replacement of primary
medical equipment as a percentage of the total equipment package over a period of 10 years.

The figure shows that approximately 18 percent of the equipment package requires
replacement in year two, while more than 50 percent of the package is replaced in year 10. For other
items, standard rules for maintenance and replacement have been applied. These are:
Page 61



*  computers: 5 year life, annual maintenance 10 percent of value;
* office equipment: 10 year life, zero maintenance; and
* vehicles: 6 year life, annual maintenance and running costs 20 percent of value.
For drugs and medical supplies, it assumed that the budget must absorb the additional costs
on an increasing basis (as project money declines).

Impacts: Targeting of Rural Population and Low Income Communities
The project will concentrate investment on new primary health centers to be used by rural
citizens of two consolidated oblasts. About 72 percent of project spending is targeted to rural areas. In
addition, although most of the oblast hospitals are in urban areas, a significant proportion (40 percent) of
the savings arising from their restructuring will be used to fund the recurrent costs of improved rural
primary care. Rural village communities are known to have per capita incomes below the $1324
national average (1998 est.). Available information from the Bank-financed recent LSMS analysis
suggests that rural standards of living are low and falling, and rural health care has suffered
Page 62



disproportionately during the transition. The project thus addresses generally low income rural areas,
and its two participating consolidated Oblasts represent a diversity of rural living standards, from the
comparatively prosperous rural communities near larger cities of Almaty, to impoverished, nuclear
testing zone settlements in the sparsely settle northern steppe regions of East Kazakhstan. Productivity
savings will improve real incomes and improve the relative value of the workforce for both government
and industry.
Training will support the improved capacity and professional status of the primary care
practitioner. Specialists may be negatively affected as will the secondary (hospital) sector of health
services. Technical assistance and training for provider payments and financial management should
enable senior health staff to use resources in a more flexible way and give incentives for lowering
admissions to the specialty clinics and hospital. This should have positive impacts on both efficiency
and quality. The current system is characterized by excessive reliance on specialty and more expensive
inpatient care. During the early years of the project, the impact will be weighted toward input and
clinical process indicators more directly than changes in health status indicators which can be expected
to change longer-term. All these indicators will be monitored over the life of the project.
Summary Analysis
The primary finding illustrated in Table 1 is that there are tangible potentialeconomic benefits
to be gained from the project, but these are not as large as the overall quantifiable costs. Discount rate
for calculating the NPV was performed at 10%, based on the Bank's traditional approach of using a
notional range of 10-12% opportunity cost for borrowing for capital. A sensitivity analysis was
performed using an NPV of 4%; the results were the same in terms of direction; relative amounts
changed (from 5.7 million to 5.1 million USD) but little due to saving streams being significant only in
later years (after year 6). A substantial portion of savings stem from savings that accrue to individuals
and families outside the health sector, and potentially to the employer. The economic justification
therefore lies to a large extent in the fact of (i) benefits going to patients and families and their
employers and (ii) from a health care standpoint that the intervention is directed at shifting health care
toward known, established cost-effective strategies for addressing an excessive burden of disease.
An analysis of the costs and savings accruing to the health sector from the project points out that
the project is reliant on four general approaches to achieve sustainability long term. First, a substantial
portion of funds will be saved through closures of duplicative facilities and efficiency gains in the
operations of the delivery system, through staffing reductions, fuel efficiencies, and so on. The
Government will develop a rationalization strategy during the life of the project, and has agreed to
develop a more aggressive rationalization strategy over the cycle of the project if financing gaps
develop. However, this needs to be carefully analyzed, and must be consistent with other goals related
to quality of care and access to services. The rationalization approach needs to be developed and
negotiated as cost and savings estimates are refined each year and as local delivery systems change over
time. The impact of rationalization will be especially significant in the TB system of inpatient care. The
project has set aside funds for technical assistance, training, and civil rehabilitation consistent with
rationalization approaches. Second, and concurrently, new financing and payment systems will develop
incentives for improved efficiency. Estimates developed in project preparation indicate substantial
waste due to excess capacity, lack of incentives, and outdated patterns of care. General practice training
will update old protocols and re-inforce new incentive structures. Third, as a percentage of budget
allocation, more of the budget needs to be directed at outpatient and primary care. This should be
possible as referrals and admissions drop; bed capacity and decreases in personnel should follow in the
inpatient sector. This is consistent with recent trends both in other Central Asia countries (e.g.,
Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan) and in other FSU countries.

There might be additional options which may be more fully developed before disbursement
begins. For example, one option is to investigate the greater use of user charges. User charges will
be considered in each oblast's financing and management plan, a condition of disbursement.
However, while charges might be useful in providing some additional resources, they are unlikely to
generate the significantly higher levels of revenue required to pay for the excess project costs. They
could, if poorly designed, also adversely affect the demand for effective medical services and counter
the anticipated positive impact of the project on access.
A second option is that the Government may be willing to commit greater relative shares of
spending for health services in the future (based on positive income elasticities across similar
countries of approximately 1.10, on average), allowing the budgets to effectively cover more costs
and so becoming more affordable to the Government. Funding the incremental recurrent costs of the
project might come from within the existing government health sector resources of the oblasts, or
from a budget subsidy from the central Government. It also could come from new taxes on tobacco
and alcohol which are not part of the analysis of benefits here.
Sensitivity Analysis
The foregoing analysis is based on a number of assumptions.
Growth Rate of the Economy: It should be noted that the financial projections assume that
the government budget for health care rise with the projected growth of the economy. This is
assumed to rise to five percent by the year 2002, and then stabilize to average 3 percent over the pay-
back period. These estimates are subject to substantial uncertainty.
Hospital Restructuring: Releasing resources from the hospital sector will be important in
funding the project recurrent costs and ensuring sustainability. If restructuring does not take place
then resources are unlikely to be available to strengthen and maintain primary care in the future.
Salary Growth: If salaries rise at a rate faster than economic growth, which is possible
given the need to boost the income of medical professionals and reduce the prevalence of informal
payments, some of the resources available to fund the deficit on recurrent costs will be lost. If, for
example, salaries were to rise at 0.5 percent above the growth of the economy this would be sufficient
to wipe out any public resources available to fund the deficit in recurrent costs. One policy
implication of this is that any growth in salaries above economic growth must be funded from
efficiency savings arising from hospital restructuring.
Size of Primary Care Facilities: The budgeted project costs and recurrent cost implications
of primary care are based on the existing size of health care facilities. In urban areas, dividing up
primary care practices has been suggested for competitive reasons. If this is done so that practices
still share equipment and premises then fixed capital and recurrent costs may remain roughly the
same. If, however, practices establish physically separate facilities then costs will inevitably rise.
Conclusion
The main objective of the project is to develop the capacity of the primary care sector to treat
disease particularly in the rural areas. The project will have an impact on allocative efficiency, by
targeting those diseases that contribute substantially to the overall disease burden, and technical
efficiency, by emphasizing cost-effective methods of treating each disease. The difficulty in placing
a monetary value on health benefits means that the analysis of the overall economic impact of the
project will remain incomplete. Despite this, the concentration on diseases that deliver high benefits
Page 64



for each dollar spent targeted at poorer rural areas should ensure that the project has a significant
impact on health status, delivering high value for money and serving as an example of good practice
for the rest of the country. Second, the health promotion component can yield behavioral impacts in
the short-run, which can boost productivity in the workplace, and may be expected to have significant
impacts on morbidity and mortality of both men and women in the longer-run. Most directly
measurable impacts short-term will be on the productivity gains of the workforce through fewer sick
days; longer-term, the impacts will be measurable through health status indicators such as expected
years of life and attendant gains in workforce and product output. It also could yield significant new
revenues through alcohol and tobacco taxes. These monetary, productivity, and health status benefits
are not included in the economic analysis.

Health Reform Program
Financial Analysis
The financial analysis examines the impact of the project upon the costs of providing health
care in the two pilot oblasts. The financial analysis and fiscal impact is based on the investment and
recurrent costs of all project sub-components over a twenty year period.
Cost Conversion
All local costs were converted into US dollars. An exchange rate of 85 tenge to one US
dollar is used, representing the exchange rate on the street (commercial rate) at the end of January
1998. Recurrent costs relying largely or exclusively on local labor (e.g., facilities construction, staff
salaries, etc.) were adjusted before converting to dollars to allow for differences in the local
purchasing power. This was done by using the ratio of $US GDP per capita at market exchange rates
to GDP per capita measured on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), estimated at 1.42.
Increased Revenues
The project investments in primary care will permit staff to treat a wider range of conditions.
This is expected to have a significant impact on admissions, lengths of stay and beds, and staffing
levels. The project preparation report estimated that the admission rate will fall by between 15 and
17 percent as a consequence. It is also true, however, that improved primary care may lead to the
identification of more disease offsetting some of the reduction in admissions (albeit for different
specialties). The analysis assumes that admissions will fall by a net 10 percent.
It is hoped that the economic incentive restructuring in the pilot demonstrations will force cut
backs in staff or a more efficient mix of staff. Currently, the Government continues to rely on old
Soviet-based input normatives for staffing of existing and newly-opened facilities. The project will
include legal changes that will provide local flexibility for hiring and firing of staff, as well as changing
the mix of inputs including personnel. Preparation estimates of personnel cut backs were developed for
facility closures and for changes in efficiency only, but still estimated between 271 to 586 per old oblast.
Assumptions for staff reductions are 10 percent in year 1, 20 percent in years 2 and 3, and 25 percent in
years 4 and 5. The savings estimates further assume that 10 percent are lost each year due to natural
attrition; the rest to redundancy. Those cut due to redundancy would receive 2 years full salary. These
total staff cut back assumptions are quite conservative and other analysis (e.g., Uzbekistan) have used
estimates based on intemational comparisons of levels of productivity (e.g., visits per physician). These
estimates showed that over the life of the project, decreases in levels and types of personnel might be
expected to decrease personnel costs by about one-third.
A second source of savings will come from restructuring and closing of facilities. These vary
across the pilot oblasts. For Almaty and Taldykorgan it is assumed that the strategy for hospital
restructuring follows a reduction in inpatient admissions of 10 percent, a reduction in average length
of stay and merger of the oncology, narcology (Almaty only) and STD dispensary with the main
oblast hospitals. In East Kazakhstan and Semipalatinsk facility closures are assumed for
tuberculosis (TB) care only. A reduction in admissions of 10 percent at the main general oblast
(children and adult) hospitals is assumed.
Page 67



The biggest source of savings derives from the reduction of tuberculosis beds and facilities
nationwide. Currently, there are a total of 13,707 beds which are located in TB dispensaries (9,165),
TB hospitals (2,345) and specialized TB wards (1,432). There are an undetermined number of
additional beds in TB sanatoria. Using WHO estimates, the number of new patients to be notified in
2001 and 2002 will be about 40,000 per year, half of them will be infectious (sputum smear positive
cases). Of that number, about 1,700 will require admission for about 60 days each on average. This
implies a figure of only about 3,400 beds will be needed for TB treatment in Kazakhstan (assuming
equal distribution over the year). An additional reserve of 20% for severely sick non-infectious cases
(like meningitis and military TB) added to 3,400 -- gives a total of about 4,000 beds that might be
required. The savings here are assumed to accrue starting in years 6 through 15 of the project,
providing ample time for implementation of new protocols, observation of the impact of the new
reforms, and planning for orderly transition of needed rationalization of facilities. The analysis also
builds in new costs for treatment of TB patients on an outpatient basis (using estimates from studies
in Russia), as a substitute for more expensive inpatient approaches now in use.
The analysis takes account of efficiency savings made at oblast-level hospitals in each oblast.
Savings are also expected as a consequence of raioon hospital restructuring and integration of
services. It is envisaged, however, that these hospitals will retain most of these savings for improving
the quality of health care at this level and, thus, these are not included in the financial analysis.
Costs
For the purposes of the analysis several assumptions are built into the cost analysis:
* Resources devoted by the Government to health care grow at the same rate as the economy
(around 3 percent per year after the year 2000);
  Expenditure on salaries and medicines grow at the same rate as the economy. Salaries of health
staff are already relatively low, and it is important that their real value is increased in order to
provide realistic incentives. International experience suggests that expenditure on medicines
grows at least as fast as economic activity as technologies of treatment advance;
*  Debts on fuel currently in the country are paid off with health sector funds. Actual expenditure
on fuel is around 25 percent below what is actually required. It is, therefore, assumed that
expenditure increases with growth in health sector resources until it is 25 percent above real
current expenditure;
*  Expenditures on maintenance of current investments increases to nearly 10 percent of the budget.
Current levels of maintenance (only one percent of the budget) are inadequate to maintain the
existing building stock.
(a)    Incremental Recurrent Costs
The project has a number of incremental recurrent cost implications. These include:
*  maintenance of the rehabilitated buildings;
*  maintenance of equipment;
*  replacement of the equipment, which will occur for most equipment during the paying off period
of the loan; and
*  cost of providing pharmaceuticals.
Page 68



The maintenance of buildings is estimated at an annual rate of 1/40 of the value of the
investment in civil works. Some of this could be absorbed within the current maintenance budget of
the oblast, but since maintenance expenditure is currently very low it is assumed that all maintenance
of project related civil works is incurred as additional cost.
Equipment recurrent costs include maintenance of purchased items together with the
expected replacement costs of equipment during the period of the loan. Some equipment will be
replaced after only a few years while other equipment will last throughout the period of the project.
These variable rates of depreciation are incorporated into the calculations through an analysis of the
frequency of replacement of medical equipment provided to PHC Centers. Figure 1 illustrates the
annual cost of replacement of primary medical equipment as a percentage of the total equipment
package over a period of 10 years.

The figure shows that approximately 18 percent of the equipment package requires
replacement in year two, while more than 50 percent of the package is replaced in year 10. For other
items, standard rules for maintenance and replacement have been applied. These are:
* computers: 5 year life, annual maintenance 10 percent of value;
* office equipment: 10 year life, zero maintenance; and
* vehicles: 6 year life, annual maintenance and running costs 20 percent of value.
For drugs and medical supplies, it assumed that the budget must absorb the additional costs on an
increasing basis (as project funding declines).
Impacts: Targeting of Rural Population and Low Income Communities
The project will concentrate investment on new primary health centers to be used by rural
citizens of two consolidated oblasts. About 72 percent of project spending is targeted to rural areas. In
addition, although most of the oblast hospitals are in urban areas, a significant proportion (40 percent) of
Page 69



the savings arising from their restructuring will be used to fund the recurrent costs of improved rural
primary care. Rural village communities are known to have per capita incomes below the $1324 (1998
est.) national average. Available information from the Bank-financed recent LSMS analysis suggests
that rural standards of living are low and falling, and rural health care has suffered disproportionately
during the transition. The project thus addresses generally low income rural areas, and its two
participating consolidated Oblasts represent a diversity of rural living standards, from the comparatively
prosperous rural communities near larger cities of Almaty, to impoverished, nuclear testing zone
settlements in the sparsely settle northern steppe regions of East Kazakhstan. Productivity savings will
improve real incomes and improve the relative value of the workforce for both government and
industry.
Training will support the improved capacity and professional status of the primary care
practitioner. Specialists may be negatively affected as will the secondary (hospital) sector of health
services. Technical assistance and training for provider payments and financial management should
enable senior health staff to use resources in a more flexible way and give incentives for lowering
admissions to the specialty clinics and hospital. This should have positive impacts on both efficiency
and quality. The current system is characterized by excessive reliance on specialty and more expensive
inpatient care. During the early years of the project, the impact will be weighted toward input and
clinical process indicators more directly than changes in health status indicators which can be expected
to change longer-term. All these indicators will be monitored over the life of the project.
Fiscal Impact
The net financial impact of the project is shown in Table 1. Over a twenty year period, the
estimated savings of $78.95 million, minus total additional discounted capital plus recurrent costs (at
loan interest rate of 6.5%) of $109.93 million amount to a net negative cash flow of $30.98 million.
Total repayments (discounted) amount to $38.54 million. The overall present value of net negative
cash flow (net costs plus repayment) is $18.17 m. This amounts to less than $2.50 per person over 20
years, or less than $0.15 per year for each inhabitant. If estimates of incremental health budget
revenues are added in, assuming straight-line growth after 2000 and GDP growth per annum of about
3 percent per year, the overall present value of net negative cash flow is only $2.3 million, and total
cash flow over the life of the loan is actually positive by $5.68 million, due to positive cash flows in
the second part of the payback period.
Sensitivity Analysis
The foregoing analysis is based on a number of assumptions.
Growth Rate of the Economy: It should be noted that the financial projections assume that
the government budget for health care rise with the projected growth of the economy. This is
assumed to rise to five percent over the next 4 years and then stabilize to average 3 percent over the
pay-back period. These estimates are subject to substantial uncertainty.
Hospital Restructuring: Releasing resources from the hospital sector will be important in
funding the project recurrent costs and ensuring sustainability. If restructuring does not take place
then resources are unlikely to be available to strengthen and maintain primary care in the future.
Salary Growth: If salaries rise at a rate faster than economic growth, which is possible
given the need to boost the income of medical professionals and reduce the prevalence of informal
payments, some of the resources available to fund the deficit on recurrent costs will be lost. If, for
example, salaries were to rise at 0.5 percent above the growth of the economy this would be sufficient
Page 70



to wipe out any public resources available to fund the deficit in recurrent costs. One policy
implication of this is that any growth in salaries above economic growth must be funded from
efficiency savings arising from hospital restructuring.
Size of Primary Care Facilities: The budgeted project costs and recurrent cost implications
of primary care are based on the existing size of health care facilities. In urban areas, dividing up
primary care practices has been suggested for competitive reasons. If this is done so that practices
still share equipment and premises then fixed capital and recurrent costs may remain roughly the
same. If, however, practices establish physically separate facilities then costs will inevitably rise.
Sustainability: Options for Funding Recurrent Expenditures
Finance for increased project recurrent costs might come from several sources. Some options
are outlined here.
(a)    Expenditure from the State Budget
Part of the recurrent costs can be absorbed by the health budget. As noted above, assuming
straight-line growth and GDP growth per annum of about 3 percent per year, the overall present value of
net negative cash flow is reduced significantly. In addition, the costs of maintaining buildings and
existing equipment are incurred with or without the project. In recent years, however, little expenditure
have been made on these items. It is probable that the cost of maintaining buildings will fall as a result
of the improvements since there is currently a large backlog of maintenance that has become very
expensive because it has been deferred. In contrast, spending will have to rise from its current
extremely low level, which is feasible if the economy generally does continue to show economic
growth. Another strategy would be to reduce the replacement schedule of the equipment and supplies,
but which could have negative health status impacts.
A second factor is expected income elasticities for health spending, which have been shown
empirically to be positive in countries over time as economies grow and develop. The national health
budget is estimated to be about US$669 million in 1997. At a steady 3.0 percent GDP growth starting in
the year 2000 (which are below IMF projections for growth), coupled with a relative growth of
commitment to health spending consistent with other middle income countries (a 10 percent relative
increase in public spending), the increase in the budget annually would be $88.98 million in year 2 of
the project, rising to about a 43.1 percent increase or about $287.67 million increment in year 5 of the
project in real terms. These increases would easily absorb expected negative cash flows in the early
years of the payback period.
A third factor is new taxes or sources of revenues. The health promotion component can
generate new revenues, for example, through new taxes on alcohol and tobacco. The cross-country
comparisons indicate a negative price elasticity of around 0.5 for tobacco, suggesting both new revenues
and fewer smokers.
(b)    User Charges
A second funding strategy is to raise revenue by additional charging for services. Given that
services in the oblasts will undergo substantial improvement it may be acceptable to charge for some
services. By law, patients already pay for all outpatient pharmaceuticals directly out-of-pocket. There
-are multiple categories of exemption. The social assessment, and other recent surveys, indicate that
patients already make substantial contributions to the cost of their care, both in terms of time and lost
wages, and for illegal informal payments for self-referrals at higher level facilities. If services were
Page 71



raised to a level where most or all of these contributions were not required, then a fixed, formal charge
might become acceptable. It would be especially useful if structured to encourage high quality care in
appropriate settings of care. The Government's preparation report recommends consideration of user
fees for (i) self-referrals to hospitals, (ii) expansion of existing private charge departments in hospitals,
(iii) a nominal daily charge or admission co-pay for inpatient care, and (iv) food and supplies in day care
settings.
To cover the full capital and recurrent costs of the project would require a charge per inpatient
stay of about $ 9.60 from each patient between the ages of 15 and 60 if admission rates of 20.2 per
1,000 (York, using MOH statistics) are assumed and roughly half the population or more is assumed to
be fall in those age groups. The average per capita income is only about $110 per month so one stay in
hospital could absorb a significant percentage of disposable income for lower income groups, though
income dispersion statistics are not available at this time. From a strict sustainability perspective, a
preferred approach would be to charge patients only for increased recurrent costs, in which case the
charge is reduced by more than half.
(c)    Rationalization Strategy
A potential source of increased cost savings would come from a more aggressive closure of
facilities, especially underutilized hospitals that may be incurring high fixed and recurrent costs. The
concern here is that Kazakhstan has already reduced beds by approximately 30 percent since 1990
according to former Ministry of Health statistics, and the Ministry of Finance has closed a number of
facilities in rural areas in the last two years and facility closures is typically a very visible and
contentious political issue. Nevertheless, a more broad-based rationalization strategy will be developed
over the life of the project. The adoption of annual specific lists of facility closures will be developed in
the context of annual work program. Follow up technical assistance could be financed on an annual
basis to provide analytic support in refining the analysis on an annual basis and carrying out this strategy
over the life of the project

1. Procurement of Civil Works
Civil Works (US$9.96 million) will be procured as follows:
(a) National Competitive Bidding  (NCB).   For civil works required for the
rehabilitation/renovation of the participating Oblast Hospitals, rural as well as urban; and the
renovations needed to establish clinical training centers at different locations. All civil works contracts
estimated to be above US$200,000 and under $1 million equivalent will be procured through NCB
procedures up to an aggregate of US$ 4.31 million. Standard Bidding Documents for Procurement of
Works (NCB-Small Works above $250,000, ECA region Sept. 1995) will be used accordingly.
(b) Minor Civil Works (MCW). Civil Works contracts below US$200,000 equivalent up to
an aggregate amount of US$ 5.65 million will be procured under lump-sum, fixed price contracts
awarded on the basis of three quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors in
response to a written invitation. The invitation shall include a description of the scope of work,
including basic specifications, the expected completion date, a form of contract acceptable to the
Bank, and the relevant drawings if applicable. This method will be used for the rehabilitation of health
centers in urban and rural areas.
2. Procurement of Goods
Goods (approx. US$ 23.76 million) consisting of basic medical equipment for hospitals as
well as basic essential equipment and supplies for urban and rural health centers; pharmaceuticals
including TB drugs and medical supplies; computers, office and training equipment, vehicles and
health promotion materials will be grouped to the extent possible and considering project objectives, in
package sizes that will encourage competitive bidding. The following methods of procurement will be
followed:
(a) International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures will be used for contracts above
US$200,000 equivalent for a total amount of US$14.02 million (59% of total goods). These goods
will consist of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, as well as computer equipment.
(b) International Shopping (IS) procedures will be used for readily available off-the-shelf
goods (including equipment) of standard specifications estimated to cost under US$200,000 equivalent
per contract up to an aggregate amount of US$ 2.61 million (12% of total goods). These procedures
will require quotations from at least (3) three suppliers from two different countries.
(c) National Shopping (NS) procedures will be used for contracts valued under US$75,000
up to an aggregate amount of US$1.13 million (5% of total goods) consisting of goods ordinarily
available in the country. Comparison of price quotations obtained from at least (3) three suppliers to
assure competitive prices will be required.
(d) Procurement from UN Agencies. Basic medical equipment for urban and rural health
centers may be procured from UNICEF catalogues for available stock items. Tuberculosis testing
forms will also be procured through this procedure. Estimated amount will be US$5.68 million
equivalent.

3. Selection Procedures for Consulting Services
Contracts for Consulting Services (technical assistance US$ 4.69 million and training
assignments US$ 4.01 million) required for the Project will be awarded following the World Bank
Guidelines "Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated January
1997, revised Sep. 1997. Contracts will be packaged to include a combination of related skills and
services, in order to make them attractive and increase competition as well as to reduce the number of
contracts to be managed by the PCU. The following methods of procurement will be followed:
(a) Quality-and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) procedures will be used for consultant
services and training contracts up to and aggregate amount of US$7.98 million equivalent.
(b) Least-Cost Selection (LCS) procedures will be used for auditing services contracts less
than or equal to $0.2 million up to an aggregate amount of US$200,000.
(c) Individual Consultant based on Qualification procedures will be used for small
assignments of short term duration throughout the life of the project. Estimate amount of total
contracts is US$ 0.5 million.
(d) Co-financiers' procurement procedures will be used for technical assistance and training
assignments provided by USAID (own financing) in the amount of US$ 1.20 million and for
assignments provided by WHO (own financing) in the amount of US$ 0.53 million equivalent.
4. Notification of Business Opportunities
A General Procurement Notice (GPN) was published in the May 16,1998 issue of
Development Business and will be updated annually for all outstanding ICB procurement thereafter.
For consultants' contracts above US$200,000 Specific Procurement Notices/Request for Expression
of Interest will be advertised in Development Business (in the English Language) and in a major local
newspaper (in the national language). Civil Works contracts procured by NCB will be advertised in a
national newspaper.
5. Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions
Scheduling of Procurement. Prior to the issuance of any invitation for bidding, the proposed
procurement plan (Table C) for the project will be reviewed by the PCU, and the Bank will be
advised of any revisions for its review in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of Annex 1
of the Procurement Guidelines. Procurement of civil works, goods and services for the project will
be carried out in accordance with the agreed procurement plan which will be modified as appropriate
and included in the progress reports subject to Bank review.
Prior review: (a) Civil Works: Prior review of bidding documents, bid evaluation and
recommendation for award as well as draft contract will be carried out for the first two contracts
under National Competitive Bidding for hospital renovations for each of the two oblasts as well as for
the first two (2) contracts for the renovations of the clinical training centers. The same review will
apply for the first two contracts under Minor Civil Works for each of the two oblast included in the
project. (b) Goods:  Prior review  of bidding documents, including review  of evaluation,
recommendation of award and contract will be conducted for all ICB procedures and the first two
contracts for National and International Shopping regardless of their value. (c) Consulting Services:

and recommendation for award will be prior reviewed by the Bank for contracts for individual
consultants above $50,000 and firms above $100,000. All documents and recommendations
involving sole source contracting will be subject to Bank prior review.
After award of contract, should any material modifications or waiver of terms and conditions
of a contract resulting in an increase above 15% of the original amount, the Bank will reserve the right
to prior review of such modifications (including modifications to contracts for consulting services).

the Bank, grant a margin of preference in accordance with Section II of the Guidelines for
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January 1995, Revised January and August 1996.

Explain briefly the Procurement Monitoring System:
All procurement related documentation that requires Bank's prior review will be cleared by Procurement Accredited Staff (PAS) and relevant technical staff. No packages above
mandatory review thresholds by RPA are anticipated. The PCU of the Borrower will maintain complete procurement files which will be reviewed by Bank's supervision
missions. The Procurement Plan will be updated annually. Procurement information will be recorded by the PCU and submitted to the Bank as part of the quarterly and annual
progress reports. This information will include: revised cost estimates for the different contracts; revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract
award, and completion time for individual contracts; as well as compliance with aggregate limits (within 15C) on specific methods of procurement. A Management Information
System (MIS), with a procurement module will help the PCU monitor all procurement information.

Disbursements
It is expected that the proceeds of the Loan will be disbursed over a period of five years,
which includes six months for completion of accounts and submission of withdrawal applications.
As there is no standard disbursement profile for Kazakhstan, the disbursement forecast is based on
the Bank's experience in financing similar projects in other ECA countries, and other projects in
Kazakhstan. The Project Completion Date is estimated to be June 30, 2003 and the Closing Date
is estimated to be December 31, 2003.

Use of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs):
Some of the proceeds of the loan are expected to be disbursed on the basis of Statement of
Expenditures (SOEs) as follows: (a) civil works for all contracts costing less than $200,000
equivalent each; (b) goods costing less than US$200,000 equivalent each contract; (c) services for
contracts for (i) individuals costing less than US$50,000 equivalent each; (ii) firms costing less than
US$100,000 equivalent each; (d) training and publications, under contracts costing less than $10,000
equivalent each; and (e) implementation and coordination agencies incremental operating costs.
Disbursements against goods and services exceeding the above limits will be made against full
documentation and respective procurement guidelines. SOEs will be certified locally by the PCU.
Related documentation in support of SOEs will not be submitted to the Bank, but will be retained by
the PCU for at least one year, after receipt by the Bank of the audit report for the year in which the
last disbursement is made. This documentation will be made available for review by the auditors and
Bank supervision missions. If ineligible expenditures, included those not justified by the evidence
furnished, or amounts in excess of agreed disbursement percentages are financed from the Special
Accounts (SA), the Bank will have the right to withhold further deposits in the SA. The Bank may
exercise this right until the Borrower has: (a) refunded the amounts involved, or (b) (if the Bank
agrees) submitted evidence of other eligible expenditures that the Bank can use to offset the ineligible
amounts.
Special Account:
To facilitate timely project implementation, the Borrower will establish, maintain and
operate, under conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special Account in US dollars in a commercial
bank, acceptable to the Bank. During the early stage of the project, the initial aggregate authorized
allocation of the Special Account will be limited to US$500,000. However, when the aggregate
disbursements under the loan have reached $4.0 million, the initial allocation may be increased up to
an authorized allocation of $1.0 million by submitting the relevant Application for Withdrawal. The
minimum amount of each application should be 20% of the authorized allocation. Replenishment
applications should be submitted at least every three months, and must include reconciled bank
statements as well as other appropriate supporting documents.
Financing of project activities will proceed through regional Project Accounts to be opened in
local branches of a commercial bank where the Special Account will be opened in each participating
oblast, through which project funds will be channeled. These will be thirty-day advance accounts and
transfers will be made from the Special Account on the basis of estimated one month expenditures as
per the annual work programs to be prepared by each oblast and approved by the Bank.
The Borrower will be responsible for the appropriate accounting of the funds provided by the
Bank under the Loan, for reporting on the use of these funds, and for ensuring that audits of the
financial statements or reports are submitted to the Bank. A computerized accounting system has
been established at the PCU and it will be expanded to the Regional Coordination Units in the two
participating oblasts. The Project Financial and Accounting Officer at the PCU will maintain
consolidated accounts for the project and will prepare quarterly financial reports as part of PMRs.
The PCU has acquired experience in maintaining and consolidating accounts through the managing
of the PHRD grant. The accounts will be maintained for all project funds, i.e. loan funds (see Annex
8 for details of financial management arrangements).

Annex 8
Health Reform Program
Financial Management
The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) established in the Committee of Health of the Ministry
of Health, Education and Sports during project preparation will be directly responsible for financial
management of the project. The PCU was responsible for managing a PHRD grant of 53 million Yen
and performed this task well.
Accounting
With technical assistance from   USTDA, the PCU designed a Project and Financial
Management Information System (MIS) as a condition of loan negotiations.  Once project
implementation starts, the MIS will be expanded to include accounting and internal control
mechanisms for the Regional Coordination Units. The system has been designed with, inter alia, an
accounting and internal control system with the capacity to record and retrieve in a timely manner, all
financial transactions under the project. The system will comply with internationally accepted
standards and will (a) reliably record and report all assets, liabilities, and financial transactions of the
project; and (b) provide reliable financial information for managing and monitoring project activities.
The accounting system will be classified by component; it will reflect the sources of funds and will be
broken down into different types of expenditures for the project. Further, it will provide informnation
on the receipt and use of funds and will be able to produce financial reports comparing budget with
actual expenditures at any given time. The system will be capable of providing financial data to
measure performance when linked to the outputs of the project.
The PCU has already a Financial and Accounting Officer (FAO) who has been responsible for
financial management and control under the PHRD. The FAO reports to the PCU Director.
Technical assistance will be made available to the PCU in project and financial management during
the first years of project implementation. The technical assistance will organize training workshops
for the PCU and the Regional Coordination Unit staff.
Financial Reporting
The PCU will maintain consolidated accounts for the Project and will ensure appropriate
accounting of the funds provided. The PCU will be responsible for preparing Project Management
Reports (PMR) on a quarterly basis, and furnish to the Bank not later than 45 days after the end of
each calendar quarter, a PMR for such period, which:
(a) (i) sets forth actual sources and application of funds for the project, both cumulatively and
for the period covered by said report, and projected sources and applications of funds for the project
for the six-month period following the period covered by said report and (ii) shows separately
expenditures financed out of the proceeds of the loan during the period covered by said report and
expenditures proposed to be financed out of the proceeds of the loan during the six-month period
following the period covered by said report;
(b) (i) describes physical progress in project implementation, both cumulatively and for the
period covered by said report, and (ii) explains variances between the actual and previously forecast
implementation targets; and
Page 91



(c) sets forth the status of procurement under the project and expenditures under contracts
financed out of the proceeds of the loan, as at the end of the period covered by said report.
The Project Implementation Manual, which was prepared by the PCU prior to negotiations
describes: (a) the financial management system proposed under the project, with special emphasis on
accounting and auditing policies, standards and internal controls; (b) the role of the financial
management systems in project management and implementation; (c) the accounting arrangements
required for project management, the format for and content of project financial reporting; and (d) the
auditing arrangements that will be used during project implementation.
Internal Control
The Chairman of the Health Committee in the Ministry of Health, Education and Sports and
the PCU Director will be authorized to sign withdrawal applications, authorizing direct payments
from the Loan account and/or requesting replenishment of the special account.
To ensure, internal control over project funds, it has been agreed with the Chairman of the
Committee of Health that only the PCU Director and the Financial and Accounting Officer will have
a signatory right on the Special Account.
Auditing
The PCU will be responsible for ensuring that the financial statement, special account, and
SOEs are audited by an independent auditor, acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with standards on
auditing that are acceptable to the Bank. The annual audit will be carried out in accordance with the
Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank (March
1982). The audit report shall be in a format in accordance with theAuditing Standards, issued by the
International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (June 1992). The audit report will include a
separate opinion for SOEs against which disbursements have been made or are due to be made from
the Loan and SOEs which will be included in the audit report accompanying the financial statements.
The audited financial statements of the special accounts, and SOEs of the preceding fiscal
year, including a separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements made against certified statement of
expenditures, should be sent to the Bank within six months of the end of the Government's fiscal
year.
The audit of the financial statement will include: (a) an assessment of the adequacy of
accounting and internal control systems to monitor expenditures and other financial transactions and
ensure safe custody of project-financed assets; (b) a determination as to whether the Borrower and
project implementing entities have maintained adequate documentation on all relevant transactions;
and (c) verification that expenditures submitted to the Bank are eligible for financing, and
identification of any ineligible expenditures.

Socio-Economic and Health Status on Participating Oblasts
Background
Since 1990, the economy of Kazakhstan has suffered a deep economic recession that saw real
GDP halved between 1990 and 1994. During the same period, revenues fell by 70 percent; all
sectors have been affected. The GDP per capita in 1994 was $1,440, and was estimated to have
bottomed in 1996 at $1,310.
Kazakhstan ranks second only to the Russian Federation in size, with 2.7 million square
kilometers, covering a vast geographical area stretching from the Caspian Sea to China. In terms of
population, however, Kazakhstan has only 15.7 million estimated at the end of 1997. Despite its
large territory, Kazakhstan is a land-locked country which depends on its neighbors for access to
international markets. The country is endowed with rich natural resources, including oil, gas, and
non-ferrous metals. Kazakhstan is divided in 14 regions (oblasts), each of which have distinct
characteristics.
Almaty oblast is located in the South-East, and East Kazakhstan in the East part of the
country. Both oblasts emerged in their present state after the administrative reform of April 1997.
Former Taldykorgan oblast merged with Almaty oblast, and former Semipalatinsk oblast merged with
East Kazakhstan. The new Almaty oblast, covering 224,200 square kilometers, has a population of
1,631,7003 and the new East Kazakhstan oblast, covering 283,300 square kilometers, has a
population of 1,632,7004. The population density in Almaty oblast is 7.2 people per square kilometer
(12.0 including the city of Almaty) and 5.8 people per square kilometer in East Kazakhstan. While
former Almaty and Taldykorgan oblasts were comparable in terrns of their size (105,500 and 118,500
square kilometers respectively) and more or less homogeneous in terms of population density (9.1
and 6.1 per square kilometers), the difference between East Kazakhstan and former Semipalatinsk
oblasts is vast. The latter is almost twice the size of East Kazakhstan oblast with a much lower
population density (4.4 per square kilometer in Semipalatinsk and 9.6 in East Kazakhstan).
Both oblasts have a typical split between rural and urban population: in East Kazakhstan,
respectively, 43 percent and 57 percent; and 42 percent and 58 percent in Almaty oblast. This is
close to the republican average of 55 percent and falls with nine other oblasts within the range of 40-
70 percent of urban population. However, if Almaty city is excluded, then Almaty oblast has the
greatest proportion of rural population of all the oblasts with about 70 percent of the population
residing in rural areas. In the former Almaty oblast the proportion of rural population was even
higher - 78 percent (57 percent in former Taldykorgan oblast). Of the two regions of East
Kazakhstan, the percentage of urban population is highest in Ust-Kamenogorsk (64 percent)
compared with Semipalatinsk region (about 50 percent).
3Excluding the city of Almaty.
4Here and below all data which applies to Almaty, Taldykorgan, Ust Kamenogorsk and Semipalatinsk regions
separately describes the status before the administrative reform and comes from the Annual Regional Statistical
Bulletin of Kazakhstan, 1996, Committee for Statistics and Analysis. All data which pertains to new East
Kazakhstan and Alnaty oblasts describes the status after the reform and comes from Regions of Kazakhstan in
Numbers, 1997, Committee for Statistics and Analysis.
Page 93



Natural population growth in Kazakhstan is 0.55 percent in the country, but overall the
country's population is declining. After steady growth during the last decades, this downward trend
became evident in the early 90s. Since 1993 the country has lost 0.9 m. people (5.3 percent). Both
oblasts started experiencing population loss around 1990. Almaty and Taldykorgan together lost
about 4.2 percent of their population since then, and the city of Almaty lost about 2.4 percent.
Together, the Ust-Kamenogorsk and Semipalatinsk regions loss amounted to 8.8 percent of
population since 1993. Out-migration to Russia, Germany and other countries is mostly accountable
for this decline, since only East Kazakhstan and Almaty city experienced negative natural growth rate
of population (-0.02 and -0.1 respectively), while in Almaty oblast average natural growth rate since
1993 was as high as 0.9 percent.
Socioeconomic Situation
Prior to the administrative reform, former Taldykorgan, Almaty and Semipalatinsk oblasts
were characterized by low level of economic development. Their shares in GDP were, respectively,
1.5, 2.7, and 3 percent. East Kazakhstan was a highly developed industrial and agricultural oblast
(9.1 percent of GDP). Taldykorgan oblast was heavily subsidized from the republican budget
(subsidy was as high as 60 percent). The region was experiencing significant reduction in
agricultural production, especially in the output of grain. Pension arrears in Taldykorgan amounted
to about 2 billion tenge as of April 1, 1997. In rural areas arrears were outstanding for 8 months.
After the administrative reform, the authorities planned to use the savings from the reduction of the
local administration to offset pension and wage arrears in the oblast.
Combined Almaty oblast accounted in 1996 for 4.8 percent of the national income. In 1996,
the territory which is now the new Almaty oblast, was the major producer of wool and root beet in
Kazakhstan. It ranked second in the country in terms of production of eggs and vegetables, third in
potato production, and fourth in production of meat and milk. Almaty is one of the three rice-
producing oblasts. Almost all kinds of agricultural production originates in Almaty oblast. Industry
in Almaty oblast is represented by electric power generation (7.2 percent of the national output),
heating (5.7 percent of the national output), production of porcelain, wool cloths, watches, and sugar
and flour processing.
East Kazakhstan is one of the key industrial areas in Kazakhstan. It has 48 percent of
national copper, 48-49 percent of zinc, 27 percent of lead, 27 percent of molybdenum, 38 percent of
titanium, 53 percent of gold and 66 percent of tantalum reserves. In 1996 Ust-Kamenogorsk and
Semipalatinsk together generated 11.6 percent of the national income. They produced the largest
output of concrete in the country - 79 percent of the national output (885,300 tons). The territory
ranked third in combined electric power generation (13 percent of the national output), 3 percent of
the output of coal (after Pavlodar and Karaganda), and steel (0.4 percent). Agriculture is also quite
developed in the area. The oblast is the major producer of sunflowers in the country, ranks second in
the output of meat (12 percent), milk (15 percent) and wool. It ranks fourth in output of eggs,
potatoes and vegetables. Virtually all agricultural products, except rice are produced in the oblast. It
was expected that with the merger, the new East Kazakhstan oblast would have greater economic
integration. Integration of their industrial potential should improve the work of coal, copper and zinc
producing enterprises: Copper concentrate produced by Zhezkentski (Semipalatinsk), could be
processed at Irtysh copper melting mill, zinc concentrate - at Ust-Kamenogorsk lead and zinc
processing and Leninogorski polymetal combinates. Integration of resources would also promote fast
development of ferrous metallurgy. Besides, it was anticipated that integration of existing power
stations would generate significant benefits. United electric grid was expected to produce 25-26
percent of the national output.
Page 94



Although due to the world financial crisis reduction in industrial production was observed
across oblasts and industries in Kazakhstan, both Almaty and East Kazakhstan oblasts experienced
industrial growth during the first six months of 1998 of 8.5 and 10.9 percent respectively.
The economically active population represents 42.5 percent of the population in the Almaty
oblast (which is slightly below Kazakhstan's average of 47.2 percent) and it represents , 46.5 percent
in East Kazakhstan oblast. According to the National Statistical Committee, official unemployment
in Almaty oblast is 3.0 percent, 6.2 percent in East Kazakhstan (which is greater than the national
average of 4.2 percent). Unemployment is the lowest in the city of Almaty - 0.7 percent. However,
the population which is not economically active (difference between the labor force and economically
active population), constitutes 18 percent of labor force in Almaty oblast, 19.7 percent in East
Kazakhstan, and 15 percent in Almaty city. The economically active population includes also those
self-employed. They account for 5.7 percent of population in Almaty oblast, 6.1 percent in East
Kazakhstan, and 7.7 percent in Almaty city.
Health Status
As it can be seen from Table 1, the health status of the population of Almaty and East
Kazakhstan is similar to that of the country as a whole, with some exceptions. For example, life
expectancy in East Kazakhstan is slightly lower than the national average. Morbidity in Almaty city
(88.3) is almost twice as high as in the country in general (44.5) and is rather low in the former
Taldykorgan region (33.6). Maternal mortality increased drastically and points out at the obvious
deterioration in health status compared even to the past year. The city of Almaty and East
Kazakhstan look extremely unfavorable with 134.3 and 146.2 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births
respectively, which is almost twice the national average of 69.4. Maternal mortality in the former
Taldykorgan and Ust-Kamenogorsk regions (1996 data) is also higher than the country's average.
According to the Table 2, Almaty city is leading in terms of death rates caused by diseases of the
circulatory system and malignant neoplasms. East Kazakhstan, on the other hand, has the highest
rate of deaths caused by respiratory diseases, as well as injuries, suicides, and other external causes,
while in Almaty oblast all these indicators are well below the national average.
Life expectancy has been continuously decreasing since 1960s with some insignificant
increase in the late 1980s and the beginning of 1990s. Since 1994, the average life expectancy has
decreased by about 2 years. The most evident trends are the reduction in the rate of respiratory
diseases throughout the country including the project sites, continued growth in the diseases of
circulatory system, and overall growth in the death rates due to injuries and suicide which have
increased by about 9 percent in the country as a whole and by about 22 percent in East Kazakhstan.
Situation in the city of Almaty is in general rather unfavorable: death rates by all causes increased
drastically for the last three years.
The death rates caused by infectious diseases have also increased during the last years in the
whole country, including former Almaty, Taldykorgan, Ust-Kamenogorsk, Semipalatinsk, and
Almaty city. The death rates due to gastroenteritis also increased in most of the country's regions,
including Ust-Kamenogorsk and Taldykorgan. However, some indicators have improved during the
last few years. There was some insignificant reduction in deaths caused by malignant neoplasms.
Also, in the Almaty oblast, there was some reduction in death rates caused by circulatory system and
respiratory diseases. Infant mortality has decreased in the country in general, though there have been
some steep rises and falls throughout this time period (Table 3). In a number of oblasts (Zhambyl,
Mangistau, Karaganda, and West Kazakhstan) infant mortality increased between 1990 and 1996
while in Almaty oblast, East Kazakhstan and the city of Almaty it showed some small reduction

Underlying reasons for the deterioration of health status are uniform throughout all the
former CIS countries: unhealthy lifestyles, including diets high in fat, smoking, and alcohol
consumption increase rates of chronic disease. The latter also contributes to the high incidence of
accidents and trauma. Besides, high levels of stress, associated with the social and economic
transition influence both health status and accident rates. In addition, the deterioration in the quality
of health care services and budget constraints limit the ability of the government to respond to these
problems.
Health Services
As a result of rationalization measures, the system of health care has been significantly
downsized during the past years. Between 1996 and 1997 the number of outpatient facilities in
Almaty Oblast decreased from 350 to 306 and in East Kazakhstan - from 336 to 302. The number of
inpatient facilities has also decreased from 140 to 108 in Almaty oblast and from 142 to 119 in East
Kazakhstan throughout the year. While closing down of inpatient facilities was evenly spread
between rural and urban areas, outpatient facilities were mostly closed in urban areas.
Total number of beds was also significantly reduced throughout the country. While overall
reduction amounted to about 16 percent, remaining beds in Almaty and East Kazakhstan oblasts
represent only 43 percent of 1996 capacity. Although reductions in beds were about 10 percent
higher in rural areas than throughout the country in general, in East Kazakhstan the burden of
rationalization was born by urban hospitals which was not the case in Almaty oblast. The
population/physician ratio has also increased with an increase being as high as 19 percent in East
Kazakhstan oblast, 9 percent in Almaty oblast and only 3 percent in the city of Almaty.
Some moderate reduction in the length of stay, admissions and physician visits have also
been observed, although reduction was not as drastic as in other indicators which more closely reflect
efficiency in resource utilization, since the length of stay, admissions and physician visits have,
probably, more bearing on the overall morbidity of population. Overall, economic transition has
negatively influenced the provision of health services. It caused massive deterioration of physical
facilities and brought about serious shortages in medical equipment and supplies.
