KOREA
THE SECOND POWER PROJECT
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Overview
1.01      Korea's indigenous commercial energy resources are extremely
limited, consisting of hydroelectric power (2,000 MW) and coal (635 million
tons). Nevertheless, Korea's buoyant, expanding economy is highly energy-
intensive - the second highest among major countries of Asia (para. 1.02).
Oil accounts for over 56Z of the total energy consumption, followed by coal at
33%. Korea imports all of its oil requirement and about 35Z of the total coal
consumption. The use of firewood - the main non-commercial fuel - which was
as high as 45Z of total energy consumption in 1965 has now been reduced to
about 5Z. Nuclear (4.5Z) and hydroelectric sources (1.5%) account for the
balance. Indigenous energy resources have been developed to optimum levels
and all future growth will depend on import of fuels.
B. Energy Consumption
1.02      During the last two decades energy consumption in Korea grew at an
average annual rate of 8%, from 11 million tons of oil equivalent (MTOE) in
1965 to about 42 MTOE in 1983. The Korean economy now is almost twice as
energy intensive as other countries at a similar level of income. The
principal reasons are the high share of manufacturing in the Korean economy,
the rapid growth of energy-intensive industries during l970s; and the
relatively cold climate, resulting in substantial space heating requirements.
1.03      The industrial sector's share of the total consumption was about 30%
in 1970, increased to 43Z by 1980, and is expected to remain stable around
this level until"the end of the century.  Energy consumption in the trans-
portation sector was less than 10% in early 1970s, increased to 15% in 1983,
and is projected to reach 22% by the end of the century. The share of
residential and coumercial energy consumption declined from 50Z in early 1970s
to 36% in 1983, in response to the rapid growth of energy prices. Further
efficiency improvement measures are expected to reduce it to 24% by the end of
the century.
C. Energy Strategy
1.04      During the period 1965-80 imports of petroleum fuels increased by a
factor of 15 making the Korean economy highly vulnerable to price fluctuations
in the international oil market. After the oil price increases of the 1970s,
the economy experienced severe recessions and large balance-of-payment
deficits and Korea had to borrow heavily abroad to meet increased oil import
bills. The Government of Korea (COK) then adopted a strategy of: (a)
reducing the dependence on petroleum by diversifying into alternative energy



sources such as nuclear, coal and natural gas; (b) choosing a wider spectrum
of energy suppliers for oil and other energy imports and participating in
overseas petroleum exploration and development ventures; and (c) readjusting
the industriaL structure of the economy, fostering energy conservation to
reduce the rate of growth of energy demand.
1.05      Korea pursued these policy changes with great vigor and speed,
achieving impressive results. On the supply side, heavy investments were made
in nuclear energy; this resulted in the creation of nuclear generating
capacity of 2,900 MW which will increase to 7,600 MW by 1989. Korea partici-
pated in several offshore petroleum exploration ventures with Japan and
private oil companies. It entered into long-term agreements with various
suppliers of oil and gas, including a contract with Indonesia to import two
million tons of liquified natural gas (LNG) per annum for 20 years, starting
in late 1986. On the demand side, the energy-GDP elasticity was reduced from
1.1 in mid-1970s to about 0.9 in 1983-84 by increasing the efficiency of tech-
nological processes involved in the transformation, transmission and consump-
tion of energy and slowing down the relative growth of energy intensive indus-
tries as compared with light manufacturing. As a result, the technical
efficiency of energy use in Korea is high by international standards.
1.06      Recent reviews by the GOK and the Bank (para. 2.13) have indicated
that there are still considerable opportunities to improve the institutional
and econom;c efficiency of the energy sector. Unlike the manufacturing and
commercial sectors of the economy, which have been increasingly exposed to
market forces, the energy sector in Korea is still subject to Government
interventions through public production, regulation, price control, taxation
and subsidization. These have led to considerable market imperfections and
institutional inefficiencies. Realizing the critical role that market forces
can play in improving the efficiency of resource allocation in the energy
sector, the Government has recently shifted its emphasis from diversification
of energy sources (para. 1.04) to improving the economic and institutional
efficiency of the sector. Reducing dependence on imported petroleum is still
important, but it is not the major objective of the energy program which is
being prepared as part of the Sixth Five-Year Plan to be implemented during
1987-91. The Government's present strategy is to: (a) improve the institu-
tional efficiency of the energy sector through the implementation of recent
public enterprise reforms introduced in 1984 (paras. 3.02/3.06); (b) gradually
deregulate petroleum product prices and trade; (c) manage the energy demand by
using more efficient pricing policies and load management techniques;
(d) monitor investment planning in the energy sector to ensure that capital
expenditures are based on a least-cost development approach; and (e) promote
cogeneration projects in the industrial, commercial and large residential
sectors.

II. THE POWER SECTOR
A. The Power Market
2.01      Electricity supply in Korea commenced as early as 1898, but it was
not until the early sixties that any significant expansion took place. Total
sales of electricity and per capita electricity consumption, which were 1,213
CWh and 45 kWh, respectively, in 1961, increased to 47,051 GWh and 1,160 kWh
in 1984 (Annex 1). The average annual growth rate of electricity consumption
during this period was 19%, among the highest in the world. Per capita
electricity consumption in Korea is presentlj higher than all other major
countries of Asia except Japan and Taiwan.
2.02      The industrial sector has been the major electricity consumer
accounting for 64% of the electricity sales in 1984. Residential (195) and
comercial (17%) consumption represent the balance.  The forecasts  of growth
in these categories until 1996 are summarized in Annex 2. Future growth in
industrial energy consumption is projected at about 7% p.a. much lower than
the historical rate as increased energy costs have made it uneconomic to rely
on energy-intensive industries. Residential and commercial electricity
demands are expected to continue their rapid growth (about 9.5% and 8.5%
respectively p.a.) due to the high rate of electrification in these sectors.
By the year 2000, per capita residential and commercial electricity consump-
tion levels are expected to be comparable with those of Japan in 1980.
Overall electricity sales are projected to grow at about 8% p.a. in the period
1985-1996.
B. Generation and Transmission Facilities
2.03      The Korean power subsector is dominated by a single public utility,
the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), whose installed capacity is
about 16,000 MW. Over the last two decades generation became increasingly
oil-based growing from 16Z in 1961 to 72% in 1980. Energy diversification
policies initiated during the mid-1970s (para. 1.04) have already brought
about a substantial change; presently, oil based generation accounts for 41%
followed by coal 23Z, nuclear 18Z and hydro 14%. By 1996, nuclear power will
account for about 44Z of power generation with coal accounting for 36Z and oil
lZ. Annex 1 gives details of the growth of KEPCO's installed capacity and
other relevant particulars.
2.04      KEPCO's transmission and distribution (T/D) facilities are tabulated
in Annex 3. In the early 1960s, a few 154 kV transmission lines connected
major power plants to the main load centers while 66 kV and 22 kV transmission
lines were extended radially from the 154 kV substations to small sized load
centers.  Distribution voltages were at 3.3 kV, 5.7 kV and 6.6 kV for medium
and 100 V for low voltages.  The T/D systems have since undergone a major
transformation.  The main changes were:  (a) by the mid 1970s, an inter-
connected 154 kV system was developed; (b) during the second half of 1970., a
new extra high voltage (EHV) of 345 kV grid was overlaid so that inter-area
power transfers are now made over an integrated 345 kV and 154 kV power grid;
and (c) in the early 1970s, a new medium distribution level of 22.9 kV was



-4-
adopted replacing the 3.3/5.7/6.6 kV systems, while the low voltage level was
raised from 100 V to 200 V. These changes are largely responsible for the
high reliability of supply and prevailing low loss levels that characterize
the system (para. 2.12).
C. Power Sector Institutions
2.05      In addition to KEPCO (para. 2.03), there are two other small
entities involved in electricity generation: (a) Kyongin Energy Company, a
privately-owned company with an installed capacity of 325 MW; and
(b) Industrial Site and Water Development Company (ISWACO), a government
agency which at present has an installed hydroelectric generating capacity of
380 MW. Their power output is sold to KEPCO.
2.06      Several government agencies participate in the energy sector and the
power sector. They are listed in Annex 5. MER has the legal authority to
supervise the power industry but it shares with EPB and the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) the responsibility for defining investment priorities in the
power subsector. The Ministry of Construction has jurisdiction over the
survey, exploration, development and use of water resources and supervises the
construction of multi-purpose hydro projects through ISWACO. Finally, the
Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) is responsible for the licensing,
regulation and supervision of the nuclear industry, although KEPCO retains the
responsibility for the design, procurement, construction, and operation of
nuclear power plants. To coordinate development strategies in the power
sector the Government established an Electric Power Group Coordination Council
(EPGCC) in July 1984. The constitution of this council and its functions are
given in Annex 5.
D. KEPCO's Development Program
2.07      KEPCO's generation expansion program for the period (1985-1996) is
summarized in Table 2.1 below. Further information is given in Annex 6.

2.08      The generation expansion program described above, which will raise
KEPCO's installed capacity in 1996 to 27,000 MW, is the least cost sequence of
power development to meet the forecast of load growth finalized during 1985.
Earlier programs prepared by KEPCO in 1984 were based on higher demand
assessments and had aimed at a target installed capacity of 35,000 MW by
1996. The substantial reductions in planned additions to generating capacity,
as well as the altered composition - with a greater reliance on coal-fired,
rather than nuclear, generating capacity - would reduce KEPCO's investment
requirements to manageable levels, and improve the overall economy of
operation.
2.09      Associated with the generation expansion program described at para.
2.08 above is the following T&D expansion program:

2.10      KEPCO's T/D expansion program has been designed to optimaLly sustain
the rated voltage and to reduce the frequency of failures. T/D planning is
done in two steps: (a) long-term, aimed at determining the EHV system
capacit7 requirements; and (b) short term, to cover extension and/or expan-
sions of facilities of 154 kV and below. The main input for T/D planning is
the forecast of regional demands derived from a 10-year time series of peak
load, system voltages, feeder loads, etc. at all main substations.

E. Power Sector Strategy and Rationale for Bar. s Participation
2.11      Bank lending to the power sector has so far been limited to one
project namely a thermal power generation project at Gojeong in 1979 (Loan
1788-KO, US$115 million). The project was completed in 1984 with a delay of
six months. Both 500 MW units at this power station are working satis-
factorily and the operation was a success. The project was completed at a
cost about 16% lower than the appraisal estimate of $657.4 million. In
addition to Loan 1788-KO, the Bank has assisted the power sector indirectly
through electricity development components of the Kyonju Tourism Project (Loan
953-KO, US$125 million, in 1973), rural infrastructure projects (Loans 1216-KO
and 1218-KO, US$60 million, in 1976), and the Chungju multi-purpose project
(Loan 1666-KO, US$125 million, in 1979).
2.12      Since its inception in 1961, KEPCO's basic objective has been to
fully meet the growing demand for electric power. KEPCO has performed this
function extremely well. Over the past 20 years, power generation has
increased about 20-fold providing electricity to almost 100% of households and
catering fully to the country's buoyant industrial sector. Thermal efficiency
of KEPCO's power plants has increased from 25% in the 1960s to 37% in 1984,
while T/D losses have decreased from 25% to about 7% during the same period.
2.13      Despite the outstanding level of technical competence attained by
KEPCO, avenues exist for improving the economic management of the sector
through flexible pricing policies, advanced end-use surveys and a load manage-
ment program and evolving therefrom the optimum level of fuel, generation and
distribution mix. The Bank's policy dialogue has therefore focussed essen-
tially on improving the economic management of the power sector. The first
structural adjustment loan (SAL I) set an objective of lowering the elasticity
of energy consumption from prevailing 1.1 (1974-80) to 0.9; the Koreans are
currently working towards lowering it further to 0.8. SAL II contained
provision for undertaking a review of the tariff structure; this study was
completed in March 1984.
2.14      As part of this ongoing dialogue, the Bank carried out a comprehen-
sive energy sector review during 1984-85, so as to assist GOK in optimizing
resource alloi7tion and attenuating the possibility of over-investing in the
power sector.- This review, inter alia, recommended (i) a downward
adjustment in load forecasts to take account of past over-estimation for the
industrial sector and improvement of the forecasting methodology to avoid
similar errors in future; (ii) introduction of load management techniques
including the introduction of interruptible tariffs and load shedding to shift
the costly summer peak to off-peak hours; (iii) improvement in the efficiency
of energy use by using waste heat for space heating in the urban load centers;
and (iv) resulting, inter-alia, from the above, the desirability of making
qualitative changes in investment program, including postponing the
commissioning of nuclear units larger than 900 MW. reducing the emphasis on
1/   See Republic of Korea:  Energy Sector Issues, No. 5307-KO, January 1985.



- 7 -
nuclear energy (limiting it to two 900 MW units every three years),
establishing a larger number of coal-fired plants and extending the life of
existing power plants from 25 to 30 years.
2.15      Most of the above recommendations relating to adjustments in the
demand forecast and consequent modulations in the investment program have been
accepted and implemented by the Government. Before translating others into
specific actions, there is a need for KEPCO and GOK to undertake extensive
work on the design of the load management program as well as assess the
feasibility of district heating and other forms of co-generation. The timing
is therefore appropriate to intensify and enrich our dialogue through a loan
operation in the power sector. Some critical aspects, which impinge upon the
sectors investment program and which will be reviewed under the project, are
considered in the ensuing paragraphs (2.16-2.23).
Demand Forecasting
2.16      Due to the recent structural changes of the Korean economy,
statistical correlations of historical electricity consumption do not fully
reflect the future demand pattern for electricity, and thus KEPCO's present
methodology of forecasting the load using econometric models does not lead to
reliable projections of demand. To arrive at more accurate projections of
demand and energy supply, KEPCO's Research Center will carry out on a regular
basis an end-use energy study to assess the demand in each sector of the
economy and combine the results of the study with those of econometric models.
Approval of Demand Forecasts
2.17      Presently, KEPCO's demand forecast, as well as its development
program, are approved by Government after periodic reviews and studies by
special ad-hoc task forces. These task forces do not work in continuity and
the revicws/approval process by the Government are not mandated at any
specified time. To improve the efficiency of the review process GOK and KEPCO
would need to formalize the review and approval mechanism. During
negotiations GOK and KEPCO agreed to establish by December 31, 1986 a
permanent demand forecasting committee, comprising members from MOR, EPB,
KEPCO, Korea Advanced Institute for Science and Technology and Korea Institute
for Energy and Resources, to review and approve KEPCO's demand forecasts and
to publish the approved forecasts on an annual basis. The first approved
demand forecast would be published during the first half of 1987.
Load Research and Load Management
2.18      KEPCO's expansion plan is based on the assumption that the annual
system load factor would stabilize at 70Z. However, considering the recent
trend of an emerging summer peak which is rising substantially above the
winter peak, the system load factor is likely to continue to decline to around
65Z by the mid-1990s unless substantial measures are taken to implement a
comprehensive load management program, covering state of the art technologies
and pricing policies. If the load factor declines, it would necessitate
larger investments than now planned. To avoid further decline in the load
factor KEPCO will undertake a comprehensive load management program and train
staff to implement this program.



- 8 -
2.19      In the context of the proposed project, KEPCO agreed that its
Research Center will: ti) with technical assistance from the Bank, design and
implement a load research and load management program which would include
demand management technoLogies, as well as a more efficient tariff policy; and
(ii) embark on an appropriate staff training program.
Investment Planning
2.20      Overall planning of the power sector should allow more flexibility
to deal with uncertainties prevalent in growth of demand and relative
availability and cost of fuels. This is particularly important to Korea
because of its almost total dependence on imported fuel to meet all its future
energy demands. KEPCO has therefore decided to: (i) review its loss of load
probability (LOLP) standard, in consultation with the Bank, weighing the cost
of additional investments to meet peak demand against the cost of outages in
various sectors of the economy; (ii) base its future plans on a range of load
forecasts with built-in flexibility for changes instead of relying on a single
base demand forecast as in the past; (iii) base its least cost expansion
program on a discount rate which satisfies the standards (currently 13Z)
applied throughout the public investment program. Lastly, GOK will intensify
studies of alternative higher value uses of LNG in the industrial, residential
and commercial sectors in view of the higher cost of using LNG for electricity
generation.
Cogeneration
2.21      District heating and industrial cogeneration offer good prospects
for improving the efficiency of energy use in Korea. COK has recently
established an entity, District Heating Corporation, and is presently
implementing two pilot projects of district heating and two pilot projects of
industrial cogeneration. GOK has also started a pre-feasibility study to
identify the potential for combined heat and power (CHP) and industrial
cogeneration. Depending on the results of this study, the Government may
decide to implement a comprehensive feasibility study of tLs technical, as
well as economic and environmental impact of implementing cogeneration
projects. Once a decision is taken to proceed with a feasibility study, the
Bank, if requested by the Government, would assist in defining its scope.
Electricity Pricing
2.22      Electricity rates in Korea have to be approved by the Government.
Changes in the rates or tariff structure are proposed by KEPCO to the Ministry
of Energy and Resources (MER), which then sends it through the Economic
Planning Board (EPB) to the Price Stabilization Committee (consisting of nine
economic ministries and nine non-government members) for review. After the
Committee's review, EPB submits the proposal to the Cabinet for approval. If
approved the new tariff schedule is issued as a Presidential Decree. Though
it appears cumbersome in practice the process is efficient. KEPCO's current
tariff schedule is given in Annex 4.
2.23      The average price of electricity in 1984 was 67 Won/kWh.  However,
the rates for various customer groups varied from 33 Won/kWh in the agricul-



9 -
tural sector to 138 Won/kWh in the commercial sector. Industrial and residen-
tial sectors paid 56 and 73 Won/kWh, respectively. Large industrial customers
have been subject to time-of-use rates since 1977. Rates in the peak, inter-
mediate and off-peak periods were initially in a 5:2:1 ratio. Since 1981
KEPCO has moved these rates closer to marginal costs by reducing the above
ratio to 3:1.5:1. As a result of the peak-load pricing policy, the peak
demand has recently shifted to the shoulder (intermediate) hours. Therefore,
the present time-of-use rates are not consistent with the structure of the
system's marginal costs. In 1984 KEPCO prepared an electric power tariff
study as part of the agreements under the Second Structural Adjustment Loan
which concluded that: (i) peak/off-peak intervals should be redefined; and
(ii) cross-subsidies among customer groups be reduced. Subsequent changes in
the cost of services, particularly of fuel prices, require updating of this
study. Thus, although the study was a commendable effort and its main thrust
encouraging some further work is necessary to arrive at a more rational rate
structure. During negotiations agreement was reached that KEPCO would
complete the study carried out under the Second Structural Adjustment Loan to
overcome shortcomings determined by subsequent reviews and prepare, a revised
tariff schedule by December 31, 1986 for comment by the Bank and approval of
GOK.
2.24      Thus, the rationale of a lending operation in the power sector
rests, firstly, on the fact that investment in this sector constitutes 40Z of
the public investment program and the Government and KEPCO need substantial
external financing to implement such a large investment plan; secondly, a few
well directed changes in the investment program could significantly improve
the pattern of resource allocation; thirdly, consistent with its import
liberalization policy, the Government and KEPCO have decided to permit
overseas competition with industries hitherto protected for procurement under
the project, and finally, GOK is currently in the process of re-examining many
planning and policy issues in the context of its Sixth Development Plan and
Bank's input at this stage could be of significant use.
III. THE BORROWER
3.01      KEPCO, a wholly owned government corporation, with an authorized
capital of 2,000 billion won (currently subscribed 1,603 billion won) will be
the borrower of the proposed loan. KEPCO was incorporated on January 1, 1982,
following dissolution of the Korea Electric Company Limited (KECO) which had
been created in July 1961 by merging the then existing three electric supply
companies.
A. Organization and Management
3.02      Prior to May 1984, KEPCO was managed by an internal board (com-
prising its president, an executive vice president and six vice presidents)
which was responsible both for making decisions and for implementing them.
Most policy decisions were, in practice, taken by the Government. After May
1984 a 2-tier management organization was introduced in KEPCO in conformity



- 10 -
with the recently enacted Government-Invested Enterprise Management Act,3/.
The new organization consists of an external board of Directors responsible
for policy making and an executive branch responsible for implementing the
policy and for day-to-day operations.
3.03      KEPCO's new board of directors consist of a chairman, KEPCO's
president and eight other members. The president of KEPCO is the only full
time member of the board and all other members, including the chairman, act in
a part-time capacity. The chairman and the president of KEPCO are appointed by
the President of the Republic of Korea on the recommendation of the Minister
of Energy and Resources. The Director General of the Electric Power Bureau of
MER and the Secretary of the Committee on performance evaluation of government
invested enterprises of EPB are the ex-officio members. The other members of
the board are appointed by the Minister of Energy and Resources upon the
recommendation of the chairman. Important functions of the board include:
setting of objectives; approval of budgets, financial plans and operating
programs; raising of long-term loans; acquisition of power plants of 50 MW
capacity or more; and investments in other enterprises; etc.
3.04      The president is the chief executive of KEPCO and is assisted by an
executive vice president and eight vice presidents each respectively
responsible for: (i) planning and administration; (ii) general affairs and
accounting; (iii) procurement, (iv) power generation; (v) transmission and
substations; (vi) business services, including distrib 4*ion; (vii) power plant
construction; and (viii) research and standardization.-   The vice presidents
of all divisions report directly to the president. Each division is
subdivided into departments (presently there are 17 departments) and several
offices/ bureaus. The organization is suitable for KEPCO's operations.
KEPCO's organization chart is attached.
3.05      KEPCO's field offices are organized into 78 branch offices and 11
district offices. Each office is responsible for the construction, operation
and maintenance of transmission and distribution lines as well as billing and
collection of revenues within its jurisdiction. These offices report to a
number of headquarters departments on a functional basis.
3.06      Several studies carried out in the past in Korea, including the
management and organization study financed under the Bank's first power
project by Coopers and Lybrand during 1980-81, pointed out that the government
control over KEPCO was excessive and that KEPC0 should be allowed greater
autonomy for managing its affairs. The promulgation of the Government-
Invested Enterprise Management Act is a positive step in that direction. The
Act gives enhanced operational autonomy to KEPCO. More importantly, KEPCO's
board of directors is now empowered to approve budgets which previously
required MER's approval. The Act also gives greater powers to KEPCO's
3/   The Act was made effective on March 1, 1984, and applies to 25
enterprises in which government ownership is 50% or more.

- 11 -
president. The power to appoint the executive vice president and other vice-
presidents which was previously rested in the government has now been dele-
gated to the president of the corporation. The Act establishes a Government-
invested Enterprise Management Council in the EPB for laying down basic
management policy, formulating common budget guidelines and evaluating
management performance of the government-invested enterprises. The Minister
of Economic Planning is the chairman of the Council; the other members include
the Minister of Finance, Minister of the ministry concerned with the enter-
prise (Minister of Energy and Resources in the case of KEPCO) and other "non-
standing" members appointed by the President of the Republic of Korea.
Criteria for evaluation of the management performance of KEPCO has been
prescribed by the EPB. During negotiations agreement was obtained that within
2 months of their completion every year KEPCO will furnish to the Bank, for
its information, copies of (a) KEPCO's report to the EPB on KEPCO's
Performance and (b) results of EPB's evaluation of KEPCO's performance.
B. Manpower and Training
3.07      KEPCO is the largest government-owned corporation in Korea.  Its
annual investment budget is over 50Z of the total budget of all the government
owned enterprises. KEPCO employs about 22,000 full-time staff of whom over
50% are engineers/technicians. About 22Z hold university or post-graduate
degrees, 1OZ are technical diploma holders, 50% are high school graduates and
the remaining about 18% have primary or middle level education. KEPCO's plans
envisage employment of over 3,000 additional personnel over the next five
years to meet its growing needs. Because of greater job security and improve-
ment in KEPCO's salary levels as well as a drop in the private sector's demand
for additional skilled manpower, KEPCO has no difficulty in recruiting and
retaining qualified and experienced staff - a problem that afflicted the
corporation in the 19609 and 1970s.
3.08      KEPCO has an active manpower development program incorporating local
and overseas training for its management and staff. A technical high school
with an enrollment of 1,800 students is operated and financed entirely by
KEPCO. This provides the basic source for its recruitment. A training center
established in 1961 imparts basic and advanced training courses in administra-
tion, finance, personnel and technical fields. In 1984, 7,447 employees
attended these courses and the training program for 1985 covers about 8,000
employees. In addition, during 1985, 110 employees will attend training in
the Research Center and in the local universities while 227 are expected to
undergo specialized training or graduate school courses overseas. KEPCO has
also established a cooperative program for training of its mid-level managers
with the Taiwan Power Corporation.
3.09      Overall, KEPCO is an efficient and well managed utility with
energetic, qualified and highly motivated staff. It annually reviews perfor-
mance by standards, inter-alia, of thermal efficiency of its power stations,
transmission and distribution losses, ratios of expenditures on fuel and
administration in relation to sales, and financial viability. Reference to
impressive improvements in thermal efficiency and T/D losses have been made at
para. 2.12. During the period 1979-1984 the annual sales per employee
increased 28%.



- 12 -
C. Accounts and Audit
3.10      KEPCO's accounting system is based on the uniform system of accounts
of the US Federal Power Commission. The system is adequately designed and
follows the government regulations and generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples in Korea. The accounts are computerized and the financial statements
are completed promptly at the end of each year.
3.11      KEPCO has a satisfactory management information system.  Detailed
reports comparing the actuals with the budget estimates are prepared monthly
and are reviewed by the management.
3.12      A standing auditor heads KEPCO's internal audit department.  He is
appointed by the President of the Republic of Korea upon the recommendation of
the Minister of Energy and Resources who must consult with the Minister of
Finance before making the recommendation. The auditor's term of office is 2
years; he reports to KEPCO's president, attends meetings of the board of
directors and submits periodic reports to the board. The internal audit
department has a staff strength of about 100 of which 50% work in the field
offices. The department conducts a comprehensive inspection of each office at
least once in two years. The scope of the internal audit is satisfactory.
3.13      KEPCO's accounts and annual financial statements are audited by
independent auditors. Till 1984 the audit was carried out by San Kyong and
Company, certified public accountants affiliated with Touche Ross Inter-
national. San Kyong has recently joined with Tong Yong & Co. and formed a new
company called San Tong which now audits KEPCO's accounts. San Tong is
affiliated with the international firm of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. The
audit arrangement is acceptable. KEPCO will submit to the Bank, as in the
past its annuaL financial statements audited by independent auditors
satisfactory to the Bank together with the auditors report thereon within
three months of the end of each year.
D. Billing and Collections
3.14      Billing for electricity is computerized and monthly bills are
prepared for KEPCO's 6.6 million customers in 6 computer centers (Seoul,
Pusan, Kwangju, Taegu, Taejon and Cheju). About 53Z of the customers pay the
bills through the banks. The collection ratio is good; accounts receivable are
less than a month's billing.
E. Insurance, Safety Practices and Taxes
3.15      KEPCO takes out insurance policies for:  (a) fire, lightning,
explosion and other risks for its nuclear plants; (b) fire insurance for
office buildings; and (c) automobile insurance for vehicles. The overseas
materials department takes out marine cargo and erection insurance. For all
other risks KEPCO maintains a self insurance scheme. Given the diversified
nature of KEPCO's assets, the present insurance arrangements are considered
appropriate to KEPCO's needs. In addition, KEPCO has exclusively financed the



- 13 -
capitalization of the Korea Electric Safety Corporation (KESCO) which has been
responsible since 1974 for research and investigation of electric hazards and
for providing safeguards. With a staff of over 1,000 experts and well-
equipped KESCO acts as KEPCO's agent on all matters related to safety and
security involving its electric power facilities.
3.16      KEPCO pays all taxes (custom duties and corporate tax, etc.) as
applicable under the Korean tax laws.
F. Project Completion Report
3.17      Assurances were obtained during negotiations that KEPCO will prepare
and submit to the Bank a project completion report promptly after the project
is completed or within six months of the closing date of the loan, whichever
is earlier. The report will cover details on the execution and operation of
the project, its costs and benefits, the performance by the borrower and the
Bank of their respective obligations under the Loan Agreement and
accomplishment of the purposes of the Loan.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
4.01      The project supports several sector objectives set out in paras
2.16-2.23. It will also assist in building up additional T/D facilities which
are necessary during 1986-1989 to match the growth of KEPCO's least cost
generation expansion program and meet the estimated demand growth reliably and
efficiently. It will help implement important programs of end-use survey and
load management, and assist in improving economic efficiency of resource
utilization through improved investment planning techniques in the power
subsector. Efforts at rationalizing KEPCO's tariff structure will be
continued in the context of recent variations in demand characteristics and
cost of services.
B. Project Description
4.02      The project comprises the following:
(a) the transmission and distribution component of KEPCO's 1986-1989
investment program;
(b) technical assistance and engineering services; and
(c) a program for strengthening KEPCO's research center.



- 14 -
Transmission Lines and Substations
4.03      The scope of the T/D component of the project involves (a) 1,400
circuit-kilometers (ckm) of 345 kV and 1,789 ckm of 154 kV transmission lines,
(b) 6,500 NVA of 345 kV and 5,760 MVA of 154 kV substation capacity; and (c)
21,880 ckm of 22.9 kV distribution lines, 3,300 MVA of distribution
transformers and other equipment.
4.04      Over the years KEPCO has steadily built up a very efficient T/D
system, where voltages are maintained close to 98% of normal levels and T/D
losses have been reduced from 28Z (in 1961) to about 7.0 in 1984. To reduce
system losses and minimize right of way problems KEPCO has followed a policy
of rapidly upgrading its system voltages. Its 345 kV EHV system commenced
operation in 1976 and now covers about 3,200 ckm. KEPCO's immediate
objectives are to improve EHV system reliability and generally maintain its
prevailing high power system standards.
4.05      The first 345 kV loop system, covering the southern area around
Busan, was formed in 1982. Two more loops would be added by 1986 linking the
new large nuclear and coal-fired thermal power stations in the south and west.
The project will assist in completing the fourth loop in the eastern and
northern areas. The EHV system is designed to deal with the imbalances of
generation sources and the geographical distribution of demand. The former
are located mainly in the southwest and northeast regions, for environmental
and other reasons, whereas demand is concentrated in the northwest (about 40%
around Seoul) and southeast (about 36% around Busan). The EHV system involves
double-circuit lines and multi-conductors (4 per phase). It is designed to be
able to deal with simultaneous loss of the largest generating set (950 MW) and
a critical section of the transmission corridor. This is consistent with
sound utiliEy practice. KEPCO expects that in the mid-1990s a new high
voltage level (possibly 800 kV) would have to be added. Studies to select the
new voltage and appropriate system configuration are in progress.
4.07      During the 1986-1989 period the 154 kV system will be further
expanded while 66 kV lines would be gradually eliminated. These 154 kV lines
would be used as subtransmission lines for power transfer to local areas and
to connect small sized new generating stations and large industrial
consumers. Salient particulars of expansion of KEPCO's transmission and
substation facilities during 1986-1989 are given in Annex 7 and indicated on
the Map No. 19075 attached. Further details are in the project file
(Annex 15).
Distribution
4.08      Initially, KEPCO utilized 3.3 kV, 5.7 kV and 6.6 kV for its primary
medium distribution voltage and 100 V for the secondary low voltage supplies
to households, etc. These have now largely been replaced by about 150,000 km
of 22.9 kV lines forming the primary medium voltage system. Two hundred volts
is the new standard low voltage. About 75Z of all households have been
upgraded to 200 V. These changes together with effective use of static
capacitors and improvements of power factor at customer's facilities have
contributed to the prevailing low loss levels (para. 2.12).



- 15 -
4.09      Rural electrification (RE) commenced around 1965 and is now about
99Z complete. Only a few isolated islets remain to be connected to the KEPCO
system. RE has modernized agriculture and the fishing industry and also
reduced kerosene consumption in the country.
4.10      During 1986-1989 the project will extend the medium voltage
(22.9 kV) system by about 21,880 km and add over 3,300 KVA of distribution
transformer capacity for residential and commercial supplies. This will cater
for annual load growth rates of 10 and conversion of the primary system.
KEPCO's distribution program is definitive for the year ahead and indicative
for the following years in accordance with set five year plan goals.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that KEPCO would provide the
Bank, for its information and comment, annual technical progress reports on
the entire T/D program pointing out any significant departures from the
overall program outlined above, and setting out the basis and details of the
distribution program in successive years beyond 1986.
Engineering Services and Technical Assistance
4.11      The project includes funds for (a) a standardization study for
future 500 MW coal-fired thermal power stations; (b) a comprehensive load
research and load management program; and (c) other energy improvement
studies. The terms of reference for (a) and (b) above have been agreed with
the Bank. KEPCO has agreed that those for the other studies will be submitted
to the Bank before their implementation.
4.12      During 1984-85 KEPCO has been reviewing its approach to detailed
engineering of some 10 large (500 MW class) coal-fired thermal power generat-
ing sets to be installed by 1996 in order to achieve the following main
objectives: (a) enhancement of plant efficiency and reliability by optimizing
system design parameters; (b) reducing total construction costs of future
power stations by using repetitive designs; (c) better control of project
construction schedules and budgets by completing more of the detailed
engineering in advance; and (d) greater use of local resources for equipment
manufacture and engineering. The first-phase of this study - which was carried
out during September 1984-March 1985 by Korea Power Engineering Company
(KOPEC) - covered conceptual design of a reference plant. It established
design conditions for the mode of operation to which these generating units
would be actually assigned viz. annual capacity factors of about 50Z (ranging
from 100I to 30% during different periods of the year). Designs involving
supercritical (3,500 psig) pressures, and once-through boilers have been
recommended in view of advantages of operational efficiency and flexibility
and KEPCO has agreed. The purpose of the second phase of the standardization
study which commenced in August 1985 is to (a) define all project systems and
details which are not site specific; (b) accelerate project designs after site
selection; and (c) reduce spare parts inventories by installing the same main
units at all sites. The study will be completed in August 1986. The Bank has
agreed with the objectives of the study and to the appointment of KOPEC.
KOPEC - which is an autonomous associate of the KEPCO group and whose shares
are owned by KEPCO - is a competent public enterprise specializing in
engineering services. It has the necessary expertise within its own
engineering organization of some 3,000 staff and collaboration agreements to



- 16 -
help carry out the study. KEPCO requested that Bank financial assistance for
the study be included in the proposed loan and that the necessary retroactive
financing of US$750,000 be provided in view of the urgency and importance of
this study (para. 4.21).
4.13      The need for and objectives of the load research and load management
studies have been described at paras. 2.18 and 2.19 above.
4.14      KEPCO uses technologies such as computerized load dispatching, to
modernize its supply facilities. As part of the program under SAL I, KEPCO
established an electric power research and development center in 1983. The
center is expected to become an important tool for the planning and
implementation of energy efficiency improvements such as load research and
demand management. The center is also required by charter to ensure high
standards of operational efficiency in the power sector by carrying out
technical research on power generation and transmission equipment. KEPCO
intends to build up a full-fledged research facility in the country's planned
science and te-Lnology center at Taejon which will become functional around
1990-1991. On behalf of KEPCO, KOPEC is currently carrying out a detailed
review of future research needs and ongoing research programs in the
electricity subsector. The Bank has been requested to provide funds in the
proposed loan to cover procurement of some of the equipment which would be
needed for the research center during the project implementation period (1986-
89). These equipment will be used:  (a) to record the hourly load data for
load management; (b) to analyze the system vibrations to diminish the failure
of power generation facilities; (c) to conduct a full scale test of 800 kV
line to choose the optimal conductor size; and (d) to examine the chemical
reactions in lubricating oil, transfer oil, water treatment agents, etc.
4.15      Whereas in the past KEPCO has utilized overseas consultants for
power system planning and designs, it is now well equipped to do most of the
engineering work itself through KOPEC and its own in-house design depart
ments. All the work of engineering and construction on the T/D component of
the project will be organized in-house. The other engineering/consultancy work
will be done by local consultants with limited use of expatriate
specialists. These procedures are satisfactory.
4.16      The standardization study of coal-fired thermal generating units
(para. 4.12) by KOPEC is estimated to require about 300 man-months and cost
about $1.0 million. The average man-month cost, inclusive of travel and
subsistence is about $3,300. This incLudes about $100,000 of direct overseas
costs.
C. Cost Estimate
4.17      The total project cost over the 4-year implementation period (1986-
89) is estimated at US$3,070.6 million, of which the foreign exchange compo-
nent cost is about US$1,030.2 million. The costs are suummarized in Table 4.1.

D. Financing
4.18      The financing plan for the project will be as follows:
US$     Z of total
million
Internal cash generation          1,462.0           48
IBRD loan                           230.0            7
Other borrowing                   1,378.6           45
Total financing requirements
(including taxes and IDC)    3,070.6           100
The proposed Bank loan of US$230.0 million will meet about 9% of total project
costs excluding taxes or about 7% of the gross cost of $3.07 billion. It
would cover about 22% of the foreign exchange cost of the project. The
proposed loan will be made to KEPCO with the guarantee of GOK and will be for
a 15-year term including a grace period of 3 years. KEPCO wili bear the
foreign exchange risk on the Bank loan. The remaining 932 of the financing
requirements for the project will be met from KEPCO's internal cash generation
(48Z) and foreign and local borrowings (45%). KEPCO has established a good
credit remiraz:;on overseas as well es in the local market and is expected to
have no difficalty in borrowing funds for the project on reasonable terms.
However, 41!ring negotiations government's agreement was obtained for meeting
any shortfall in funds required for completion of the project.
E. Project implementation, Procurement and Disbursement
4.19      The project will be implemented by KEPCO during the period 1986-89
(pa-rs. 4.25-4.27). KEPCO has ample experience in this type of work. ALl
works are contracted out. KEPCO normaliy procures all goods and works for its
T/D program through local competitive bidding procedures as there are now a
number of suppliers within the country, ensuring a reasonable level of compe-
tition, acceptable quality and economic prices. However, during discussions
with the Bank in connection with the proposed loan, in the context of recent
import liberalization policies, GOK authorities and KEPCO agreed that a select
List of equipment and materials required for the T/D program should be pro-
cured by KEPCO following ICB procedures in accordance with Bank Guidelines.
The select list comprises transmission line towers, conductors, insulators,
capacitor voltage transformers, lightning arrestors, relays, circuit-breakers
and switches, watt-hour meters, and concrete poles for the distribution
system. These items, except for concrete poles, are fit for ICB and foreign
firms will be interested in participating, though local competition would be



- 19 -
strong. Qualifying domestic bidders would receive a preference in bid
evaluation of 15Z or tie import duty, whichever is lower. The rest of the
items, which are not financed by the Bank, would be procured through KEPCO's
normal procedures which are satisfactory.
4.20      Except for concrete poles, all other equipment financed under the
proposed Bank loan shall be procured by international competitive bidding
(ICB), in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Concrete poles, which have a
40X foreign cost component, do not lend themselves to ICB procedures because
of their high freight cost:. These poles will, therefore, be procured through
local competitive bidding procedures which are acceptable to the Bank.
Foreign firms are not precluded from participation.
4.21      KOPEC - which has just completed the conceptual study of large coal-
fired thermal generating sets - will be employed for the second phase of the
standardization study (paras. 4.12/4.16). The cost of the study is only
$1.0 million out of the Bank loan of $250.0 million. Introducing competition
for this study would delay the implementation of the study and KEPCO's genera-
tion expansion programs. [OPEC's continued employment is cost effective. The
Bank therefore agreed with KEPCO's selection of KOPEC and its financing.
Other consultants' services would be procured in accordance with Bank
Guidelines.

4.23      All procurement documents for bidding packages for goods financed by
the Bank and estimated to cost over $1,000,000 would be subject to the Bank's
prior review.
4.24      The Bank loan would be disbursed on approved contracts as follows:
(a) 100S of the costs of engineering consultancy services and technical



- 20 -
assistance; (b) 100% of the CIF price of imported equipment and materials or
100% of the ex-factory price of locally manufactured equipments and materials;
and (c) 40% of the ex-factory price of concrete poles. Disbursements against
consulting services and for equipment contracts costing less than US$1,000,000
million equivalent each would be made on the basis of statements of expendi-
ture (SOEs). To facilitate disbursements a revolving fund would be estab-
lished with an initial deposit of US$10.0 million equivalent to about 4 months
of expected expenditures. Documents supporting the SOE's would not be sub-
mitted to the Bank but would be kept by KEPCO and made available for review by
the Bank's supervision missions. Any savings under the loan would be
cancelled unless otherwise agreed with the Bank.
4.25      The entire T/D program will be implemented during the period 1986-
89. During appraisal, the mission reviewed KEPCO's implementation program, as
also its program of procurement of equipment to meet this construction
schedule (see Project File). To ensure rapid implementation, KEPCO's drafts
of (a) instructions to bidders and general conditions of contract, and (b)
technical specifications of transmission/substation equipments, were reviewed
for inviting bids for international competition. An omnibus advertisement has
been issued in the Development Forum on August 15, 1985.
4.26      KEPCO has decided that, except for transmission towers which will be
procured for each line/section on multi-year contracts, all other T/D equip-
ment will be procured on an annual basis, based on approved budgets. The
following schedules have been agreed for the 1986 procurement:
(a)  Issue of bid documents      -  September/October 1985
(b)  Opening of bids             -  December 1985/January 1986
(c)  Evaluation of bids          -  February/March 1986
(d)  Bank approval of awards    -  March/April 1986
(e)  Award of contracts          -  April/May 1986
The procurement for the years 1987 through 1989 will be organized e.a a similar
basis. The main construction work will be completed by December 30, 1989, and
the closing date of the proposed Bank loan will be June 30, 1990.
4.27      As most of the procurement procedures have been streamlined,
construction programs have been detailed, and KEPCO has an established
reputation for efficient project implementation, prGcurement action and
construction of this project is expected to proceed smoothly. Annex 9 gives
the schedule of disbursement for the project. The table also provides a
comparison with the Bankwide profile for disbursements on transmission and
distribution projects. The disbursement for the first two years is close to
the Bank-wide profile. The faster disbursement rate during the next three
years is based on the agreed implementation program and the advanced status of
preparation of the project.
F. Environment
4.28      KEPCO has designed its T&D project in accordance with sound utility
practice and due regard to environmental impact. This project will be no
exception and will cause little disturbance to the environment. Underground



- 21 -
cables - though expensive - are run wherever necessary. No environmental
problems are expected from this T/D project.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Introduction
5.01      During the past five years, KEPCO's sales increased from 31,145 CWh
in 1979 to 47,051 GWh in 1984, or at an average rate of growth of about 9Z
p.a. However, sales in 1984 were about 21% lower than the forecast of 59,432
GWh made at the 1979 appraisal of the Cojeong power project when sales were
expected to grow at an average rate of about 14% p.a. With declines in demand
growth projected to continue, KEPCO has postponed some of its major investment
expenditures into the early 1990's.
B. Past Operations
5.02      KEPCO's financial operating statistics over the period 1979 through
1984 are summarized in Table 5.1. Detailed statements are given in Annex 10.

5.03      Because of the large increases in fuel prices in 1980-81, KEPCO's
fuel costs per kWh sold increr.ed from 13.4 won in 1979 to 25.9 won in 1980,
34.8 won in 1981 and 38.2 won in 1982 before coming down to 31.2 won in 1983
and 26.1 won in 1984 mainly as a result of declines in international oil
prices and the commissioning of some nuclear units. Fuel costs constituted
over 50% of KEPCO's operating expenditures. To meet these large increases in
fuel prices, the government allowed the following tariff increases: (a)
February 1, 1980: 36%; (b) November 19, 1980: 17%; (c) April 21, 1981: 10%;
(d) December 1, 1981: 6Z. In July 1982 the Government approved a decrease of
about 5% applicable to small industrial consumers followed by an average 3Z
decrease in April 1983 for all consumers to pass on to them the savings in
fuel costs.
5.04      KEPCO's present average tariff of 67.4 won/kWh is slightly higher
than its long-run marginal cost of supply. A review of the structure of the
tariff will be made by KEPCO by mid-1986 (para. 2.23).

C. Financial Position
5.05      KEPCO's comparative financial position in 1984 and 1985 is given in
Table 5.2. The balance sheet for 1984 is based on audited financial state-
ments and that for 1985 is based on REPCO's estimates.

/a    Including current portion of long term debt of 1,110
and 1,167 for 1984 and 1985 respectively.
5.06      KEPCO's capital structure is sound.  Inventory turnover level is
also adequate. The current ratio has been maintained at less than one time
including the current portion of long term debt, or about 1.7 times excluding
the current portion, reflecting the high repayment requirements of its large
borrowing program. KEPCO has been able to manage its liquidity position by
effective working capital management and arranging refinancing when needed
(para. 5.12).

D. Investment in Subsidiaries
5.07      As of the end of 1984, KEPCO has invested 148 billion won in its
subsidiaries of which a major part (138 billion won) is in Korea Heavy Indus-
tries and Construction Co. Limited (KHIC). With this investment KEPCO owns
34.7% of KHIC's shares; the balance is owned by Korea Development Bank (KDB)
and Korea Exchange Bank (KEB). KHIC (formerly Hyundai rnternational, Inc.) is
a manufacturer of plant and equipment primarily for power generation, steel,
and petrochemical industries. It has been in financial difficulties and has
been incurring operating Losses mainly due to over-capacity in the sector and
slower than expected growth in overseas demand. The company's net-worth as of
December 31, 1984 was only about 65Z of its share capital. Thus, KEPCO's
share-holding in KHIC is worth about 90 billion won only, a loss of 48 billion
won for KEPCO (or about 1.2% of KEPCO's equity at end of 1984), which KEPCO
has not yet written off in its books. KEPCO proposes to make provision for
the amortization of this loss over a number of years.
5.08      In 1983 the Government directed KEPCO to invest a further sum of 30
billion won in KHIC to provide funds for its research and development program.
A sum of 7 billion won was contributed by KEPCO in 1984, 10 billion won for
1985 and the balance of 13 billion won would be invested in 1986. No further
investments are planned. The Project Completion Report (Loan 1466-KO) notes
that KHIC's management expects the company to return to profitability by 1986.
5.09      KEPCO's investments in other subsidiaries aggregate to a total of 10
billion won. These are in Korea Electric Power Operating Services (KEPOS) -
3.0 billion won (1OOZ of shares); Korea Power Engineering Co. (KOPEC) - 3.2
billion won (98% of shares); and Korea Gas _o. (KGC) - 3.8 billion won (17Z of
shares). The value of these investments is about 12 billion won. No further
investments are planned in these subsidiaries.
E. Capital Expenditures
5.10      KEPCO's investments increased from 1,999 billion won for the period
1975-79 to 7,305 billion won for the period 1980-84. A summary breakdown of
KEPCO's investment is given in Table 5.3.

5.11      KEPCO's investment programs have placed high emphasis on nuclear
power generation in order to diversify its energy sources.  Nuclear generation
is projected to increase from presently around 25Z of total generation to over
501 by 1991. The construction period for nuclear plants is longer than that
for conventional plants (7 years for nuclear as compared to 4 years for
thermal and 5 years for hydro plants). Since full utilization of generation
capacity after the comnmissioning of a nuclear plant usually takes two to three
more years as a learning period for safety reasons, this emphasis on nuclear
investment has important financial implications. At a time when internal cash
generation is restrained by slowdown in its electricity sales due to less
bouyant demand in the industrial and export markets, KEPCO has to rely heavily
on external borrowings to support its investment program.
5.12      The large debt service obligations associated with the borrowings
have imposed a heavy burden on KEPCO. The terms (and grace periods) of some
of KEPCO's borrowings have not matched the construction period and the
lifetime earning power of the assets they financed as well as would be
desirable. However, as a practical matter, the repayment obligations on debts
with relatively short- or mediur-terms have, where necessary, been met by
refinancing (paras. 5.06 and 5.20). KEPCO has maintained conservative
debt/equity and net fixed assets/debt ratios and has had satisfactory interest
coverages. Hence, it has had a reasonable basis for arranging refinancing or
new borrowings for a large portion of its construction requirements and does
not expect to have difficulties in making similar arrangements in the future,
when needed.
F. Financial Covenants Under Gojeong Power Project
5.13      Under the Gojeong power project (Loan 1788-KO) two financial
performance covenants were agreed: (a) a rate of return of at least 9% on a
rate base including (i} average revalued net fixed assets in operation less
consumers' contributions in aid of construction, (ii) 100% of works in
progress and (iii) provision for working capital; and (b) a minimum debt
service coverage of 1.2 times. KEPOO achieved about 9% rate of return in



- 26 -
1980, 1981 and 1984 but in 1982 and 1983 its rate of return was 7.2% mainly
due to (i) a 50% increase in the value of works in progress, (ii) lower sales
growth and (iii) higher fuel costs. On a rate base consisting only of average
revalued net fixed assets in operation, however, KEPCO's rate of return in
each of these two years was about 14%. KEPCO follows an accelerated deprecia-
tion policy based on an average plant life of 18 years. This policy tends to
understate th.A annual rate of return performance by about 1-2%, compared to
the common practice of an average life of 25-30 years. KEPCO's practice is
considered an appropriate strategy considering its large requirements of
capital and was accepted under Loan 1788-KO.
5.14      With regard to the debt service coverage, KEPCO exceeded the agreed
minimum in 1980 and 1981 but fell slightly below that level to 1.1 times in
1982-84 because of higher debt service obligations on borrowing for nuclear
plants which are not yet in full commercial operation (para. 5.11). The Bank
agreed to the lower targets for both covenants for these years in considera-
tion of the above-mentioned reasons.
G. Future Performance
5.15      KEPCO's financial forecasts (income statements, sources and
applications of funds statements and balance sheets) for the period 1986-1991
and its latest estimates for 1985 are given in Annex 11. Notes and
assumptions used in the forecast are given in Annex 12. The results are
suimnarized in Table 5.4.

5.16      KEPCO's financial forecasts have been analyzed applying, inter alia,
three standard criteria: (a) satisfactory financial performance as measured
by a rate of return on revalued net fixed assets in operation; (b) internal
cash generation sufficient to meet a reasonable proportion of KEPCO's
investment program; and (c) acceptable capital structure and debt service
coverage. These are discussed in paras. 5.17 - 5.21 below.
H. Rate of Return
5.17      Based ofi the usual criterion of the rate of return (ROR) on revalued
net fixed assets in operation (less consumers' contributions), and assuming
tariff increases in 1986-89 to offset inflation and maintaining them at the
1989 current level in 1990 and 1991, KEPCO will achieve a ROR of about 10Z in
1986 and r-nge between 9% and 11% in 1987 through 1991. Though lower than the
13% - 15% rate of return achieved in 1980-84, this level of performance is
fully acceptable given the slowdown in demand growth, high costs of LNG fuel,



- 28 -
large increases in the asset base, and the time lag between commissioning and
full commercial utilization of nuclear energy.
5.18      Using the higher rate base (i.e. including 100% of works in progress
and provision for working capital) for calculating the rate of return, KEPCO
will achieve about 7-8% in 1986-88 and about 92 in '989-91. While including
works in progress in the rate base may have been deemed appropriate in 1979
for the Gojeong power project, that approach has been reconsidered for the
following three reasons:
(a)  Comparing the slower, albeit still very substantial, rates of growth
in electricity sales against what were expected in 1979, it appears
in retrospect that the financial targets established at that time
were over-ambitious;
(b) The general practice followed by most utilities and in other Bank-
financed projects is to exclude works in progress from the rate
base. The usual practice in Bank-financed projects is to wait until
new plant is commissioned and earning revenues before beginning to
recover the costs from consumers; and
(c)  KEPCO's works in progress are uneven.  They are projected to
decrease from the present level of 55% of average net fixed assets
to 172 in 1988, 9Z in 1989-90, 17% in 1991 and rise again to about
56% in 1994. Their inclusion in the rate base wouldt therefore,
tend to distort the picture of KEPCO's financial performance as
measured by the rate of return on assets in operation.
5.19      The commonly used definition of rate base (i.e. average revalued net
fixed assets in operation less consumers' contributions) will be adopted for
measuring KEPCO's financial performance under the proposed loan.  The minimum
rate of return requirement will be 9X for the period 1986-1988, and 10 from
1989 onwards. Assuming increases in electricity rates in 1987 to 1989 to
offset inflation at the same levels and to reflect the long run marginal cost,
KEPCO's projection shows that it will be able to meet these minimum rate of
return requirements and improve its self-financing ratio to a satisfactory
level with adequate internal cash after meecing its debt service obligations
(paras. 5.20 and 5.21).
I. Capital Structure and Debt Service Coverage
5.20      KEPCO's capital structure is sound.  No further COK equity
investment in KEPCO is planned. Debt as a percentage of total capitalization
is projected to decrease from 60% in 1986 to 47% in 1988 and further to about
32% in 1991. KEPCO's debt service obligations have been on the rise and that
trend will continue through 1988. Its debt service of 728 billion won in 1982
(excluding interest charged to construction) nearly doubled to 1,450 billion
won in 1985 and will triple to 2,299 billion won in 1988 before it comes down
to 1,992 billion won in 1990 and to 1,838 billion won in 1991. This high
level of debt service obligations arises from borrowings with terms which
poorly matched the construction period and lives of assets they financed



- 29 -
particularly for the nuclear generating plants. However, KEPCO will have no
difficulty in continuing to maintain its satisfactory asset to debt ratio and
interest coverage ratio (para. 5.12); the net fixed asset to debt ratio is
estimated at above 1.6 times in 1985 and will continue to rise to about 2.9
times from 1990 onwards and the interest coverage ratio will remain above 1.1
times and increase to about 2.8 times by 1991. KEPCO's debt service coverage
ratio (DSCR) is estimated to be about 1.0 times in 1986-1988 and will improve
to 1.3 times in 1989 and 1.8 times in 1991. This growth of debt service
coverage is satisfactory.
J. Self-Financing Ratio
5.21      For reasons explained in paras. 5.11 and 5.20, KEPCO is experiencing
significant increases in its debt service obligations during the period 1983-
1988. While KEPCO is expected to meet its debt servicg requirements, its
internal cash contribution to investment is negligible-/ and KEPCO has to rely
on external borrowing and other sources for financing. This situation is
projected to continue until 1988.  With the proposed rates of return and debt
limitation covenants (para. 5.22), KEPCO's self-financing ratio will improve
to about 40X in 1989 and remain at abouc 50% from 1990 onwards. This
improving profile of performance is satisfactory and results mainly from
reduced investment and lower debt service requirements after 1988.
K. Proposed Financial Covenants
5.22      At negotiations, KEPCO and Government agreed to take steps,
including but not limited to adjusting its tariff, to enable KEPCO to achieve
an annual rate of return of not less than 9% for 1986-88 and 10% for 1989
onwards on average revalued net fixed assets in operation (less consumers'
contributions in aid of construction). KEPCO also agrees to maintain a
minimum debt service coverage of 1.2 times except that for the three years
1986-88, the coverage will be not less than 1.0 times.
L. Financing Plan
5.23      KEPCO's forecast of sources and applications of funds is given in
Annex 11. A slim-ary of KEPCO's financing plan for the period (1986-91) is
given in Table 5.5:
5/   The self-financing ratio becomes sLightly negative for 1985-1988 after
taking into account the increases in working capital.

/a   Including provisions for self insurance, staff severance payments and
assets retirement, etc.
5.24      The financing plan for the project period (1986-89) envisages a
capital expenditure of 6,255 billion won to be met 75% from foreign and local
borrowings. The remaining 25% will be financed from net internal cash
generation (72) and other sources (18%); the latter represent the estimated
net increase in provision;; for self insurance, staff .everance payments and
premature retirement of assets. Instead of separate funding of these
provisions, KEPCO invests them in its own plant which is a common practice of
most utilities and is acceptable. In analyzing KEPCO's projected financial
statements and calculating debt/equity and net fixed assets/debt ratios we
have conservatively treated these provisions as part of KEPCO's long term
debt. The low contribution from net internal sources during the period 1986-
89 is mainly due to the relatively large increase in KEPCO's debt service
requirements. However, KEPCO will have a substantially improving trend in its
self-financing capability beyond 1988 (paras. 5.20 and 5.21). As shown in the
financing pLan for the period 1986-91, external borrowings will account for
about 60% of KEPCO's investment, and net internal cash generacion (25%) and
funds from other internal sources (15%) wiLl finance the remaining 402. The
above financing plan is reasonable. Given its financial standing, KEPCO is
expected to have no difficulty in arrangiL-g external financing sources to
support its development program.
5.25      KEPCO's borrowing strategy is likely to depend on several factors:
(a) cost of borrowing; (b) availability of funds; (c) size of investment; and
(d) self-generation. KEPCO has already established a good credit reputation
and has developed considerable expertise in approaching the capital market.
However, a cautious approach to external bc rowing is still fully warranted



- 31 -
given the volatility of the market and the resulting impact on KEPCO's
finances.
5.26      During negotiations, agreements were reached that:
(i)   KEPCO would prepare, by December 31, 1986, a 10 year financing
and investment plan, taking into account alternative financing
sources and the associated costs. The plan would also include
a study of the impact on KEPCO's finances and recommend
measures, if needed, to ensure a continusd improving trend of
financial performance; and
(ii)   KEPCO would update this plan annually and provide the Bank with
a copy of the plan together with a complete set of financial
projections for review and comment within three months of the
beginning of each fiscal year.
5.27      For the purpose of evaluating the impact of various financing and
investment plans, the study mentioned in para. 5.26 will include an analysis
of KEPCO's financial performance in terms of rate of return, self-financing
ratio and other relevant indicators such as debt/equity ratio, debt service
and interest coverage ratios, and total net fixed assets to total debt ratio,
etc.
M. Sensitivity Analysis
5.28      Given the uncertainty in the world and domestic environment, any
significant changes in the critical parameters adopted for the financial
forecasts (such as sales, tariffs, fuel costs and borrowing terms and
conditions) will have a major impact on KEPCO's financial prospects. A number
of sensitivity tests have been performed on these parameters in order to
assess the magnitude of the impact of a change in these parameters on KEPCO's
finances over the next five-year period (1986-1991). The results are
summarized in Table 5.6.

/a   Including changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities
5.29      The base case assumes:  (i} medium demand scenario (para. 6.07);
(ii) annual fuel price escalation of 3%; (iii) capital expenditure as given in
KEPCd's 1985 investment program; and (iv) borrowing at 1oX p.a. with a 10 year
repayment. Assumptions underlying the other cases are: (a) Case 1 assumes
low demand scenario (para. 6.07) with no change in investment expenditures;
(b) Case 2 assumes annual fuel price escalation of 5%; (c) Case 3 assumes
borrowing at 9%; and (d) Case 4 assumes 15 year repayment. For all these
cases the other assumptions are the same as in the base case.
5.30      From the above table, it is clear that Case 1 and Case 2 have the
most significant impact in terms of net internal cash generation and
borrowings. Lower sales growth from 8.3% p.a. to 7.0% p.a. over the period
1986-91 would reduce about one third of the net internal cash generation or
about 1,150 billion won, and increase borrowing by about that amount.
Increase in the fuel cost by 2 more percentage points would reduce the net
internal cash generation by about 920 billion won. In both Case 1 and Case 2,
the resulting ROR in 1989 will be about 1.5 percentage points less than in the
Base Case, and the DSCR will be slightly lower (1.2 times instead of 1.3
times). A reduction in the average interest rate from 10% to 9% would imply a
saving in interest expense of about 29 billion won and extending the repayment
period from 10 year to 15 year would reduce the debt service requirements by
about 79 billion won.

VI . PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Justification
6.01      The project is a sequel to the Bank's Energy Sector Review (Report
No. 5307-KO) carried out during 1984/1985 which addressed, inter alia,
important issues in the power subsector. Most recommendations made therein
were well received by GOK and KEPCO (paras. 2.14-2.15).  In particular,
programs for improvements in investment planning, load research and load
management (paras. 2.16-2.23) to be undertaken under this project would
strengthen the power sector.
6.02      The T/D component of KEPCO's investment program accounts for about
42Z of the total investment during the 1986-1989 period. In the past, the
Bank's attention had been focussed mainly on generation. Attention to T/D is
timely in the context of future Bank lending operations which would most
likely be subsector wide. As explained earlier (paras. 4.01 and 4.05) the EHV
lines included in the project are necessary to ensure reliable integrated
operation of generating stations which are being located increasingly distant
from load centers. The T/D expansion is designed to optimally sustain the
rated voltage and to reduce the frequency of failures and intervals (para.
2.10). Load flow studies and fault and dynamic analysis are performed using
computer packages of PECO (Philadelphia Electric Company) and PSSE (Power
System Simulator). The reliability standards are based on guidelines prepared
by the U.S. National Electric Reliability Council in April 1975.
B. Economic Rate of Return
6.03      Since the T/D project consists of numerous dispersed items, its
benefits are not attributable to a specific region or a specific group of
consumers. It is, therefore, inappropriate to calculate the economic rate of
return of this T&D project in isolation from the rest of the investment
program. Accordingly, the economic rate of return was calculated for KEPCO's
investment program for the period 1986-89 of which the proposed pr&lect is a
part.
6.04      The internal economic rate of return (IERR) was calculated based on
the incremental cost and benefit streams associated with the 1986-89
program. Investment costs were calculated for generation, transmir ion and
distribution facilities which would be in place during this four year
period. The generating plants being added amount to about 5,250 MW mainly
consisting of 5 x 950 MW nuclear units and 5 multi-purpose hydro projects with
total capacity of about 400 MW. Investment costs on all of these plants were
traced back to their initiation stage and all the costs incurred prior to 1986
were included in the cost stream.
6.05      The IERR is 152 (details are given in Annex 13), which is higher
than the opportunity cost of capital (13%). The figure of 13% is presently
used by the Government as the minimum rate-of-return standard for public
investment. It indicates the lowest acceptable rate of return that investment
funds should earn if allocated to other projects (sectors).



- 34 -
Consumer Surplus
6.06      The above rate of return (para. 6.05) is based on "direct" benefits
of incremental energy consumption as measured by the revenues associated with
the incremental sales of electricity. To capture, at least partially, the
indirect benefits of electricity consumption, consumer surplus was estimated
and included in the benefit stream. Estimation of consumer surplus was
carried out based on the demand functions for various customer groups
developed by the Research Center. Although consumer surplus varies within
customer groups and over time, its weighted average remains between 26-28Z of
direct benefits. When included in the benefit stream, consumer surplus raises
the IERR from 13% to 19%.
Sensitivity to the Demand Forecast
6.07      The present forecast is that the demand would reach 21,500 MW in
1996 growing annually at 7.9Z. Two other scenarios of demand forecast which
correspond with 8.7% and 6.9% annual growth rates, have been worked out
representing high and low trends (Annex 14).
6.08      To examine the sensitivity of IERR to the variations in demand
forecasts, the incremental energy sales from the 1986-89 investment program
were recalculated by simulating KEPCO's operations planning model based on the
high and low demand scenarios. These incremental sales were then used to
recalculate the direct benefits, to adjust the O&M costs and recompute IERR.
The results of this sensitivity analysis are presented in the following table:
Table 6.1: IERR ON KEPCO'S 1986-89 INVESTMENT PROGRAM
Base demand       High demand      Low demand
Consumer surplus excluded               15                16                 12
Consumer surplus included               19                20                 16
Return on the Long-Term Plan
6.09      KEPCO's 1986-89 investment program is part of KEPCO's 1986-96 long-
term development plan. Changes in IERR which would result from extending the
investment horizon from the next 4 years to the next 11 years (the Sixth and
Seventh Development Plan Periods) have also been calculated (para. 6.10). in
addition to the 5,250 MW which would be commissioned in 1986-89 about 6,000
MW, consisting of 10 x 500 MW coal, 1800 MW of nuclear, and 600 MW of pumped
storage plant would be added during 1990-1996.  Somz  1,300 MW of oil based
thermal plant would be retired during this period.



- 35 -
6.10      IERR for the long-term development plan is 14X.  This rate is lower
than IERR on 1986-89 investment program despite the economic advantage of coal
(over nuclear) units which would be commissioned in 1992-96. This slightly
lower rate of return is due to the fact that the cost of T/D facilities to be
constructed after 1989 is proportionately greater. Inclusion of consumer
surplus in the benefit stream would increase IERR to 18X.
6.11      The sensitivity of IERR with respect to variations in load forecast
was also analyzed by recalculating the incremental energy sales from the
proposed development plan based on the "'high" and "low" demand scenarios. The
results of this sensitivity analysis are summarized in the following table:
Table 6.2:  IERR ON KEPOD'S LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT PLAN
Base demand     High demand      Low demand
Consumer surplus excluded           14               16              12
Consumer surplus included           18               19              16
Internal Financial Rate of Return (IFRR)
6.12      IFRR for both the 1986-89 investment program and the 1986-96
development plan were calculated by including tazes and duties in input costs
and excluding the sales ta_es from the revenues.  IFRR for the 1986-89
investment program is 12X and for the 1986-96 development plan 11.
C. Risks
6.13      The scope of TID program is definiLive only for 1986 and is subject
to adjustmenLs thereafter in accordance with the set Five-Year Plan goals and
available resources. The only risk of any significance associated with this
project is that of delay in completion on account of limitations on KEPCO's
financial resources. This has been minimized by the extent to which KEPCO's
earlier development programs (of 1984) have been pruned after GOK reviews
during 1985 (para. 2.08). Being a T/D project, the impact of any such
financial difficulty would be either a delay of some system components or a
slight drop in overall efficiency, which would be acceptable given the high
standards achieved by REPCO.

from the overall program and setting out the basis and
details of the T/D Program beyond 1986 (para. 4.10);
Cv)   KEPCO would maintain a minimum annual debt service
coverage of 1.2 times except that for 1986-1988 the
coverage will be not less than 1.0 times (para. 5.22); and
(vi)   KEPCO would prepare by December 31, 1986, a 10-year
financing and investment plan, update it annually and
provide the Bank with a copy thereof, together with a
complete set of financial projections within three months
of the beginning of each year (para. 5.26).
(b) With GOK and KEPCO
Ci)   A permanent demand forecasting committee wonld be formed
by December 31, 1986 to review and approve KEPCO's demand
forecasts and to publish the approved forecasts on an
annual basis (para. 2.17);
(ii)   KEPCO would complete the tariff study which was carried

KEPCO's Tariff.
Tariff Structure
Electricity tariffs are structured as multiblock Progressive rates
in the residential and comercial sectors and flat rates in the agricultural
sector, street lighting and small Industries.  The large industrlal consumers
are, however, charged according to a peak load pricing structure which was
introduced in Decenher 1977. The rate structure is suwmarized in the table
below:

which is responsible for oil related activities including
development, production, storage, processing and supply/demand
i_usues;
(d) Korea Petroleum Development Company (PEDCO), created in 1980, to
attract petroleum operators to participate in exploration/
development in Korea and abroad;
Ce) Korea Gas Corporatiop (KGC), established in 1983, to carry out the
- overall planning and implementation of the gas transmission and
distribution systems including the construction of the terminal and
transmission pipelines to Seoul/Incheon and the supply of gas to the
system; and
(f) Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), which was established in
1961, to develop power resources and generate, transmit and
distribute electricity throughout the country.
2.        In addition to  ER and its affiliates several other ministries and
public entities are involved in the mrnagement of the energy sector. The most
important of these are: (a) Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), esta-
bLished in 1967, which has significant energy related functions including the
administration of the nuclear energy program in Korea; and (b) Economic
PLanning Board (EPB), which is in charge of integrating economic and energy
policy. Also affiliated with MOST, are the Atomic Energy Bureau (AEB) and
Korea Advanced Energy Research Institute (KAERI). The interministeral
coordination of energy policy formulation and implementation is the responsi-
bility of the Energy Policy Reviewing Comittee whose members include vice
ministers of EPB, HER, MOST, Ministries of Construction, Commerce and
Industry, Firance, Home Affairs, and Transportation as well as presidents of

Water Development Company (ISWACO).
3.        The institutions in the power subsector have been described in
paras. 2.07-2.08. The Government has recently (July 1984) established an
Electric Power Group Coordination Council (EPGCC) whose main objective is
coordinating of the major development strategies in the power sector. The
council deliberates on power development programs and makes recommendations on
them. It also fosters self reliance in technical matters including
standardization of coal fired plants and their construction. The council
meets every three months. KEPCO's president is the chairman of the council;
the other members are the chief executives of the following organizations:
(a) Korea Heavy Industries and Construction Co. Limited (KHIC) which
manufactures various kinds of equipment and components for hydro,
thermal and nuclear plants. KHIC also builds industrial plants such
as cement, steeL, petro-chemicals, off-shore structures and
salinating plants. KHIC is a subsidiary of KEPCO.
(b) Korea Power Engineering Co. Limited (KOPEC) which provides
consulting services for design and engineering of power generating
facilities including nuclear power plants.
(c) Korea Electric Power Operating Service Co. Limited (KEPOS) which
undertakes maintenance of power plants, transmission and
distribution facilites and industrial facilities.
(d) Korea Nuclear Fuel Co. Limited (KNFC), which is responsible for
localization of the fabrication of light water reactor fuel.
(e) Korea Advanced Energy Research Institute (KAERI) which works under
the Ministry of Science and Technology and is GOK's prime
institution for research in atomic energy.
(f)  Korea Electric Safety Corporation (KESCO) which carries out research
on electric hazards and develops safeguards against them.
(g) Korea Gas Company (KGC) formed in August 1983 to handle the LNG
imported from Indonesia for power generation and for household
consumption will soon be the eighth member of the EPGCC.

SECOND POWER PROJECT
Notes and Assumptions Adopted for Financial Forecasts
The following inflation rates are adopted in the financial
projections:
1986    1987    1988    1989    1990    1991
Local          5.0      5.5     5.5      5.5     5.5      4.5
Foreign        7.0      7.0     7.5      7.7     7.6      4.5
(a) Income Statements
(i). Electricity Sales are based on KEPCO's revised July 1985 "Long-
Range Power Development and Financial Plan" as reviewed by the
Appraisal mission.
(ii) Operating Revenues have been derived by assuming that average
electricity rates will be increased each year unLil 1989 to com-
pensate for domestic inflation, and remain unchanged from 1990
onwards.
(iii) Fuel KEPCO's current price estimates have been increased by 1Z
p.a. for nuclear (heavy and light-water) and for coal. For LNG
and oil a 3% annual increase in prices has been assumed.
(iv) Purchased power costs are based on KEPCO's current price
estimates (July 1985 Plan) of purchases escalated according to
estimates of domestic inflation in Korea.
(v) Personnel Expenses (including Accrued Retirement) are based on
KEPCO's current price estimates (July 1985 Plan), escalated
according to estimates of domestic inflation in Korea. Number of
employees, excluding construction staff assumed for each year are
as follows:

1987          21,341
1988          21,915
1989          22,415
1990          22,628
1991          22,856
(vi) Maintenance and Other Expenses have been escalated using
estimated domestic inflation in Korea. Other expenses include
amortized nuclear fuel costs.
(vii) Depreciation Expense calculations have been based on KEPCO's
existing depreciation rates i.e. assuming an average life of 18
years. Additions have been depreciated at half rates in the year
in which they are first taken up as part of assets in service.
(viii) Tax calculations assume the existing income tax at an average
annual rate of 14.875Z of taxable income during the period of the
forecasts.
(ix) Interest Expense has been based on the rate of interest for
foreign and local borrowing for different types of projects. The
average annual rates for the forecasts are:
1986          8.86Z
1987          9.53%
1988         10.21%
1989         10.61Z
1990         10.48%
1991          9.62%
(x) Interest during construction (IDC) is based on KEPCO's investment
program and the associated financing plan. KEPCO follows the
practice of capitalizing IDC applicable to projects where the
construction period is over one year.
(b) Balance Sheet
(i) Gross Fixed Assets in Service, Accumulated Depreciation revalued
in 1977 (9.3%) and in 1978 (11.3%) in accordance with government
regulations. Revaluation is carried out when the cumulative
wholesale price index exceeds 25%. Land has been revalued by
"Taxation Standard Price 'Valuation b!ethod" based on the rates
established by the Ministry of Home Affairs for taxation
purposes. Other fixed assets have been revalued using wholesale
price indices. The last revaluation was carried out in 1982
which increased the asset book value by about 100%. For 1986-
1991 gross fixed assets and accumulated depreciation are annually
revalued by 6.3% p.a. based on domestic and foreign estimated
inflation rates.

(ii) Nuclear fuel is shown as a fixed asset item. It is amortized
approximately over three years, following the industry's
practice.
(iii) Current Assets
- Customers' receivables represent four week's sales.
- Inventories have been projected on the basis 3f power sales
growth (902 of the power sale growth rate) and escalated using
same domestic inflation rates.
(iv) Deferred and Other Assets are based on KEPCO's estimates of
foreign ezchange losses to be amortized and the investments in
subsidiaries.
(v) Capital is assumed constant throughout the projection; no further
capital contribution by the government is assumed.
(vi) Revaluation Reserve includes the amounts for revaluation of gross
fized assets net of revalued accumulated depreciation.
(vii) Accounts Payable/Other Liabilities are escalated using the same
domestic inflation rates.
(viii) Repayment conditions are as follows:

Calculation of the Internal Economic Rate of Return
Main Assumptions
General
Costs and benefit figures contained in Table 1 of this Annez
correspond with the 'base case" where calculation of electricity benefits and
-O& 0 costs is predicated on the "base scenario" of the load forecast and
consumer surplus is not included in the stream of benefits.-
All costs and benefits are expressed in 1985 constant dollars.
Investment Costs
Generation investment costs are for the projects scheduled to be
comissioned during the period 1986-89. T&D investment costs are based on
KEPCO's 1986-89 investment program.
Operations and Maintenance Costs
Operation and maintenance costs are based on the actual cost- figures
in 1984. Fuel requirements were calculated by simulating KEPCO's operations
planning model. Mhe fuel requirements were then fed into MEPCO's "fuel cost
model" which takes account of the purchase price of the nuclear fuel as well
as the costs involved in the conversion, enrichment, fabrication and disposal
of the fuel.
Energy Sales and Revenues
Incremental energy generation was produced by simulating KEPCO's
operations planning model. Incremental energy sales were calculated by
adjusting the incremental energy generation for T&D losses and auxiliary
energy consumption. Average price of electricity was assumed to remain, in
real terms, at its 1984 level.
