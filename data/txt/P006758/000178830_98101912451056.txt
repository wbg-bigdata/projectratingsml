1. THE SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      Colombia's main indigenous commercial energy resources are
hydropower, coal, gas and oil. Potential hydropower appears to be the
most promising at some 100 GW of capacity and 250-300 TWh of annual energy
capability, as shown by the preliminary investigations made by the Govern-
ment with technical assistance from the Federal Republic of Germany.
1.02      Colombia is also endowed with very large coal and gas deposits.
Over 1970-77 crude oil output declined at an average rate of 6.5%/a.
Over the same period, consumption of petroleum products increased by
5.5%/a. As a result, Colombia is now a net importer of crude oil (it was
a net exporter until 1976) and prospects are for these imports to rise
sharply to onerous levels by the early 1980s unless additional reserves
are discovered and developed quickly. Measures are being taken (1.05) to
deal with this problem and to develop alternative energy sources. In the
case of coal, there have been various obstacles to more adequate utiliza-
tion of the existing potential: prices as low as one-fifth of those
prevailing on international markets, the competition of low-priced petro-
leum, fragmentation of production among a large number of very small mines
with low output and productivity levels, and lack of efficient marketing
and transport infrastructure. However, the Government is currently taking
action to address these problems, and large-scale development of coal
reserves is planned (1.04). With respect to natural gas, a previous decline
in known reserves and output has been dramatically reversed with the dis-
covery of large deposits in the Atlantic Coast region. These reserves
(estimated at over 5 x 1012 ft3) will provide energy and petrochemical
feedstock to this rapidly industrializing region.
1.03      Output of primary energy during 1965-75 has not kept pace with
overall economic expansion. It increased only 3.6%/a during 1965-70 when
it reached its peak at 690 x 1012 Btu, and declined since then to 637 x 1012
Btu in 1977, mainly due to falling crude oil output:

In contrast to the declining energy output, final energy consumption has grown
by 8.9%/a during 1965-70, and 8.5%/a during 1971-73, when economic growth was
high and energy prices declined sharply in real terms. During 1974-77, the
economic down-turn and increase in real energy prices had a dampening effect
on consumption, which now has settled at a growth of about 4.5%/a compared
with a GDP growth of some 6% in recent years.

1.04      The Government's development strategy is aimed at achieving a
more favorable balance between domestic energy supply and use, thus
utilizing more fully those energy sources which are in abundant supply,
i.e., hydropower, natural gas and coal. The Government is planning a
large-scale development of coal deposits by state entities in association
with foreign investors. For that purpose, a new enterprise, CARBOCOL,
has recently been created and is likely to emerge as the Government's
chief agency in coal-related matters. The Government attaches high
priority to developing the thermal coal deposits at El Cerrejon (reserves
600 Mt and production target 10 Mt/a) near Riohacha in the department
of La Guajira on the Atlantic coast under CARBOCOL's responsibility in
cooperation with foreign investment. The Government also intends to
step up surveys of identified coal fields in the provinces of Santander
and Antioquia with the intention to study the feasibility of using low
grade coal for firing large thermal plants required in the early nineties
when potential hydro sites are expected to be increasingly more costly to
develop (1.24). Small private firms which own coal mines are pursuing
plans to expand output in order to supply fuel for heat intensive
industrial processes and in-plant power generation. In order to expand
potentially viable mines, a well-coordinated Government program is needed
to provide a more rational price structure, improvements in mine safety,
credit facilities and support for marketing and infrastructure. Such a
program would need substantial technical and capital assistance from abroad
and the Bank is providing guidance to the Government in the preparation of
a proposed coal engineering project.
1.05      In the hydrocarbon sector, the Government has taken action to
stimulate investment in exploration and field development, which had
declined after 1971 because of unrealistically low prices applied to
domestic sales. The Government is encouraging foreign participation in
exploration and development on the basis of association contracts with
ECOPETROL (the Government oil agency). The prices paid for oil produced
by increasing yields from existing fields and from new fields have been
raised, the latter now being close to world market levels, and the dis-
criminatory exchange rate for petroleum has been eliminated.  As a result,
interest among foreign petroleum companies to expand or start operations
in Colombia has been intensified and a significant up-turn in exploration
is expected.
1.06      Plans are underway to explore the country's uranium potential
and the Government has concluded an exploration contract with the French
IMinatome group. The development of any uranium potential that might
exist would provide the country with another long-term energy option.
Sector Organization
1.07      Electricity is the fastest growing form of energy use in Colombia;
its share in overall energy consumption has grown from 14% in 1960 to 25%
in 1977.  This process has been assisted by the gradual consolidation of
isolated facilities into regional systems and the interconnection of these



systems to facilitate development of Colombia's low-cost hydro resources.
The main systems are (see Map 3948) the Central System, covering the
interior and the Pacific coast, and the Atlantic (or Northern) system
covering the northern part of the country. The site of the San Carlos
hydro station, for the first stage of which a loan of MUS$126 (1582-CO)
was approved in 1978, and of which the present project constitutes the
second phase, is located in the Central System. By 1982 a full national
grid will have been established with the completion of a 500-kV line inter-
connecting the Atlantic and the Central systems, for which a Bank loan of
MUS$50 (1583-CO) was approved at the same time as the loan for San Carlos I.
1.08      Public electricity services are presently provided by:
(a) municipally-owned companies, independent of the Central
Government, of which the largest are Empresa de Energia
Electrica de Bogota (EEEB), Empresas Publicas de Medellin
(EPM), and Empresas Municipales de Cali (EMCALI);
(b)  national enterprises such as Instituto Colombiano de Energia
Electrica (ICEL), the Corporacion Autonoma Regional del
Cauca (CVC), and the Corporacion Electrica de la Costa
Atlantica (CORELCA);
(c) a large number of local subsidiaries of ICEL, CORELCA and
CVC 1/; and
(d) a generating and transmission company, Interconnexion Electrica
S.A. (ISA), the shareholders of which are EEEB, EPM, CVC, ICEL
and CORELCA.
ISA is the beneficiary of the San Carlos I loan mentioned above and will own
and operate the 500-kV line interconnecting the Atlantic and the Central
system, to be financed by the Government which is the borrower for Loan
1583-CO.
1.09      ISA was established in 1967 to provide a rational framework
for sector development by interconnecting the systems of its shareholders,
thus creating a national grid capable of sustaining large hydroelectric
developments. By pooling their financial resources through ISA, its
shareholders have been able to undertake much larger and more economical
projects than would have been feasible under the previous arrangements
for independent growth. Colombia also has a number of public entities
known as Regional Autonomous Corporations with a range of functions
related to development of the regions under their jurisdiction, including
legal capacity to generate, transmit and distribute electricity. CVC is
the largest of these entities. The Ministry of Mines and Energy owns
part of the sector directly through ICEL and CORELCA. EEEB and EPM,
presently the largest utilities, are controlled by autonomous municipal
governments. CVC reports to the National Planning Department (NPD) as
1/   In most cases, the ownership of these subsidiaries is shared with
local governments.

Regulation, Planning and Coordination
1.10      The Ministry of Mines and Energy is charged with formulating a
national policy for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity
although it shares responsibility with NPD in defining investment priorities.
The Ministry discharges its functions through its Electric Energy Division and
was also given the responsibility for coordinating and supervising power sector
planning. This division is still small and is in the process of being organized.
It does not have the powers assigned to similar agencies in other countries
(issuance of licenses, regulation of tariffs, approval of expansion programs)
to enforce its policies and programs. Public utility retail tariffs (including
those for electricity) are regulated by the Junta Nacional de Tarifas de
Servicios Publicos (JNT) in the NPD, which has customarily approved requests
for rate increases. However, utilities are free to set tariffs at levels
lower than those approved by the Junta and have done so in the past. Although
the Government cannot enforce its policies directly on the municipally con-
trolled power companies, a mechanism for reaching agreement on major issues
affecting the sector is provided by ISA, in which the Government has a major
although not controlling interest.
1.11      Sector planning and coordination have improved markedly, as
illustrated by the following:
(a)  In line with its recently revised bylaws, ISA defines the
generation and transmission expansion program for the inter-
connected system. On the basis of studies carried out by
it and its shareholders, ISA executes simulation studies and
ranks plant in order of economic merit. After approval
by its Board, this becomes the national expansion program.
As specified in these bylaws, all plants requiring a joint
effort of all its shareholders are constructed, owned and
operated by ISA. Plants of regional interest may be built
by one or several shareholders, subject to ISA approval
of such regional plants. Under these arrangements, ISA is,
in effect, responsible for an important part of sector
regulation and planning; only utilities which do not
participate directly in ISA and the regional development
corporations, other than CVC, would not be covered by its
decisions. Voting arrangements in ISA have been restructured
to require the concurrence of four of its five major share-
holders in all important decisions, thus protecting the
interests of the municipal utilities and encouraging a more
positive participation in its deliberations;
(b)  As part of the San Carlos I loan, ISA and its shareholders
agreed to prepare and present to the Government and the Bank for
comments by December 31, 1979, a Power Sector Development Master



- 6 -
Plan. This plan is to cover the period 1980-90 in detail and
1991-2000 in general terms and consolidate the programs for
generation and transmission expansion. Similarly, ISA's
shareholders undertook, under the coordination of the Ministry
of Mines and Energy, to prepare and present, as part of ISA's
Master Plan, to the Government and the Bank for comments by
December 31, 1979, a 1980-2000 Sector Development Master Plan
for Distribution consolidating all existing and future programs
for distribution and covering the period 1980-85 in detail.
Overall, the Master Plan is expected to provide a valuable
framework for long-range decisions on sector financing,
pricing and rural electrification which have in the past been
based on partial and uncoordinated information. With respect
to generation, the laster Plan will be based partly on an
ongoing sector study which is expected to be completed by
about mid-1979, and for which assistance was obtained from
the Federal Republic of Germany. The first part of this
study, which has been completed, concentrated on sector
institutions and financing. The second part, which is being
carried out with assistance from ISA, will comprise a compre-
hensive survey of the country's hydro resources;
(c)  As agreed under the San Carlos I loan, a tariff study based
on marginal costing is underway covering the most important
supply areas in the country. With Bank guidance, this study
is being carried out through a committee in which experts from
the Government, ISA and its shareholders participate; and
(d)  Also under the aegis of San Carlos I, a study is being executed
by consultants to assess the extent and causes of losses in
the main power systems down to the level of distribution with
the objective of identifying and carrying out actions which
would minimize such losses.
World Bank Participation in the Sector
1.12      Since 1950, the Bank has made 21 loans to Colombia's power sector,
totalling US$610 million (Annex 1.1). Seventeen loans have assisted the
expansion of capacity in the systems of Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Cartagena,
Bucaramanga, and Manizales. In addition, the Bank is currently supporting
rural electrification under the Integrated Rural Development Project
(1352-CO, 1977). A report of the Bank's Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) on the "Third Power Expansion Program Loan 537-CO" (Report No. 536,
June 29, 1977) concluded that the objectives of the 1968 US$18 million
loan to EEEB for expansion of its generating capacity (by 200 MW) and
transmission, subtransmission and distribution systems had been met,
despite some delays and a 12% cost overrun. A previous OED report, "Third
Medellin Power Project - Loan 369-CO" (Report No. 450, May 24, 1974) concluded
that the project had been very well executed despite considerable geological
difficulties; although EPM's tariff levels were adequate to generate suffi-
cient funds, anticipated revenues did not fully materialize because of power
losses in the distribution system, a problem which has since been rectified.
Overall bank operations in the sector have also been reviewed in two OED



-7-
reports 1/ which concluded that the Bank's financing had been successful
in assisting the power companies to develop hydroelectric plants at lower unit
cost than they otherwise would have been able to do. This permitted greater
urban coverage as well as cheaper and more reliable electricity supply to
industry. OED also commended Bank efforts in the establishment of the central
interconnected system which facilitated further power sector development. In
addition, OED identified as important considerations for possible future loans
in the Colombian power sector: the need to give greater attention to power
distribution; the need for improvement of financial recording and financial
planning capabilities; and the need to give more attention to public utility
tariff structures.
1.13      The first OED recommendation (distribution) was addressed in
Loan 874-CO (1973) which included expansion of electricity distribution
in low income areas. However, between 1973 and 1978 Bank objectives
could not be pursued through lending because of institutional difficulties.
The municipal utilities were reluctant to relinquish their independent
role in generation and also experienced severe financial constraints
which reduced the availability of funds to ISA. Decisions on system
expansion required protracted negotiations among the shareholders and
the Government; those negotiations were further complicated by the
original shareholders' reluctance to allow the incorporation of CORELCA
into ISA. Throughout these negotiations, the Bank continued to support
the concept of centralized planning, construction and operation of the
national grid and resisted proposals that would weaken ISA. Because of
the time required by the shareholders to arrive at decisions on these
fundamental issues, Bank consideration of San Carlos I, the 500-kV
Interconnection and EEEB's Mesitas hydroelectric project, all of them
urgently needed to avoid power rationing in Colombia, suffered consider-
able delays. A solution finally evolved after extensive discussions
between the Bank, the Government and the shareholders, and the three
loans made in 1978 served as a vehicle for addressing again the various
OED's recommendations. Currently, a distribution project for the Bogota
area is being considered for Bank financing, Bank involvement in a
similar project in the CORELCA system appears possible, and a tariff
study is being executed (1.11). Under the proposed loan a study will be
made of the design of a common system of accounts for public power
utilities.
1.14      The recent developments in the sector (1.11) have increased the
confidence in the possibility that through further lending, the Bank's
objectives in the sector can be more fully realized in the medium term.
They are in general: coordinated sector planning, efficient organization
and operation, and sound financial management; within the general scope of
these objectives specific attention in the short term should be given to:
least-cost operations, rational distribution developments, improvement in
financial recording and financial planning capabilities and development of
adequate tariff structures and levels on a common basis throughout the
country.

Power Market and Supply
1.15      Electricity generation in Colombia increased by an average of
9.7%/a over the period 1960-70 and then slowed to about 9% on average
until the end of 1977 1/ due to the slackening in industrial growth after
1974 (industrial consumption decreased to 7.2%/a compared with 9.5%/a
during the sixties). Present annual per capita electricity generation
is estimated at about 610 kWh, which is below the average for Latin America.
Installed capacity at the end of 1977 was 3,765 MW, including self-production.
Hydro stations accounted for 68% of total energy generation.
1.16      Colombia has about 2.2 million electricity subscribers in an
estimated total population of 25.2 million; 88% of these subscribers are
residential, and electricity service reaches 62% of the population. Studies
by the Bank's Development Policy Staff indicate that Colombia has been
able to provide electricity service to a very high proportion of its urban
population (86%, with the connection rate exceeding 98% in the larger
cities). However, only 36% of the families in small towns (500-2,500
inhabitants) and 16% of other rural families had service in 1976. Of
the electrified municipalities, 88% have continuous service, while the
other 12% have service only during certain hours of the day. In
many towns the quality of the service is unsatisfactory because of lack
of maintenance.
1.17      Residential consumers were responsible for the largest share
of electricity sales by the major utilities in 1977, followed by industry:

1.18      Public utilities accounted for 93% of total electricity supply;
the rest was provided by self-production.  Of the public supply, EEEB
generated 24%, EPM 22%, CORELCA 14%, CVC and ICEL 13% each, and ISA 7%.
Self-suppliers (mainly oil refineries, petro-chemical plants, steel
mills and cement works) owned 5.7% of the country's installed capacity;
these plants are also connected to the public electricity service.
The public-service labor force totalled 13,445 at the end of 1977,

Rural Electrification
1.19      About 36% of the population lives in areas classified as rural.
Although most of the rural villages with electricity service are close to
the urban centers, connection density is modest (1.16). It is estimated
that the cost of a rural electrification network, for the country as a
whole, would be about US$600 per household; assuming that, over a period
of six years, electricity could be brought to about 20% of the rural popula-
tion presently without service (about 40,000 dwellings a year), the cost
would be some MUS$150. The lack of comprehensive data with respect to ongoing
and expected rural electrification efforts is expected to be remedied through
preparation of the Masterplan (1.11).
1.20      Rural electrification programs are currently underway in a
number of regions in the country. Among the most important are:
(a) the electrification subproject of the 1977-79 Integrated
Rural Development Program supported by IDB, Canadian
International Development Agency and Bank financing
(Loan 1352-CO);
(b) the electrification program in the department of Choco financed
by the Netherlands Government; and
(c) the electrification program in the coffee-growing areas,
financed by coffee sector resources.
Sector Investment Program and Studies
1.21      The total 1978-85 investment program of ISA and its shareholders
(except for ICEL for which reliable information is not available), excluding
interest during construction, amounts to about Col$290 billion in current
prices (about US$3.6 billion in end-1977 prices), with a foreign component
of about 60%.  Of the total, 65% pertains to ISA, 16% to EEEB, 9% to
CORELCA, 7% to EPM and 3% to CVC. Taking into account that the shareholders'
portion of the program also includes considerable investments in generation



- 10 -
and transmission, some 70-75% of total investments would pertain to genera-
tion, which is extremely high (a range of some 40-60% would be the norm).
Because the new generating capacity would be of little use without a network
path to the consumers, upward adjustments in investments for subtransmission
and distribution can be expected and it is therefore probable that the esti-
mated cost of Col$290 billion is understated. The master plan for power
development to be prepared by ISA and its shareholders (1.11) is expected
to provide a basis for firmer total investment estimates.
1.22      The investment program also includes, in addition to the projects
already decided upon by the Government and ISA's shareholders (4.01), the
start of generation and transmission projects which will be commissioned
after 1985. ISA is now regularly updating 1/ its study of economic ranking
of projects which indicates that the 1984-88 portion of this program, on
which decisions still have to be taken (the program up to 1984 is being
executed), would be the least-cost alternative for system expansion.
1.23      The study shows that, beyond plant already decided upon, only
limited thermal capacity would be required up to about 1988; Cerrejon II
(150 MW) in the CORELCA region as well as Tasajero I (132 MW) in the
Central System (ICEL, North Santander) should be advanced as much as
possible for completion not later than by the end of 1984, but hydro
plant as scheduled would otherwise meet incremental demand for capacity
and energy until the end of the period.
1.24      The introduction of large thermal plant later in the century
is expected to play an important role in ISA's planning in the next
few years (lead time for mine development and power station construction
may aggregate some 10 years). Even the large hydro potential of some
100 GW (1.01) would be completely utilized by about 2020 and the use
of the country's large coal reserves for firing of thermal plant may
become more economic than hydro well before that time. The Government
is aware of this problem 2/ and the Bank (through preparation of a
proposed coal engineering project) together with the Government agencies
involved, is addressing the problem. It is expected that the Government,
without abandoning the objective of appraising all of the country's
potential coal fields will focus on surveying and studying two areas:
Tasajero in North Santander and Bolombolo in Antioquia. The use of coal
for thermal plant firing and the substitution of coal for oil would be
the primary objectives. It is anticipated that preliminary surveys and
project preparation for a full study will warrant financial assistance
in about a year. The inclusion of relatively large thermal plant also
appears justified in terms of reliability of supply: to arrange the
necessary financing for the large hydro plants being considered is time
consuming and, by itself, may be a cause for delays while delays
due to physical problems during construction are not unusual.

- 11 -
1.25      The generation investment program will impose a heavy financial
burden on ISA and its shareholders. To ensure that only sound projects
are undertaken, assurances have been obtained under the San Carlos I loan
that ISA and its shareholders would not undertake construction of any
generating plant or combination of plants of more than 200 MW (ISA) and
100 MW (shareholders) capacity prior to completion of San Carlos I unless
satisfactory evidence has been presented to the Bank that it is economically
justified and that adequate financing is available to carry it out without
jeopardizing the project. This covenant has been repeated in the
agreements for the proposed loan.
Finances and Tariffs
1.26      Except for EEEB and EPM, which have histories of adequate cash
generation, the power sector has relied heavily on borrowings and budgetary
contributions to finance its investments. EEEB and EPM operate low-cost
systems and cover the most affluent markets in the country; they have,
therefore, been able to finance their investments with an appropriate
balance of borrowings and cash generation while charging relatively low
rates. Because there has been no mechanism to obtain financial transfers
within the sector from the more affluent areas to the less affluent, CVC,
ICEL and CORELCA, which operate high-cost systems in lower income areas than
EEEB and EPM, have had to rely on budgetary contributions from the Government
and subsidies, despite their higher rates.
1.27      Rate adjustments lagged considerably behind yearly inflation over
most of the period 1971-76, during which average rates increased by about
13%/a while inflation averaged 19%. The 1977 average revenue - at prices of
1970 - was equivalent to Col$0.179/kWh (89% of the 1970 average revenue of
Col$0.202/kWh and up from Col$0.147 in 1976). The average 1978 rate is
expected to be in the order of Col$0.780-0.800 or about USV2 equivalent.
Furthermore, the positive trend in rate setting is expected to continue as a
result of the agreements reached under the San Carlos I loan. In view of
the importance to economic growth of adequate electricity service, the Govern-
ment has adopted a policy calling for adequate rates in order to ensure that
the sector generates internally a reasonable portion of the funds required.
It should be noted that Colombia is still fortuitous in having access to
relatively low cost hydro energy: ISA's development program is estimated to
cost, in current prices, only about US$530/kW (4.03). As a result, the
current rates are among the lowest in the world while meeting the
requirements of sound financing of the power sector in the main centers.
1.28      In view of the considerable imbalances that currently exist
in the structure of tariffs and the rates (residential consumers pay
about half of the average charged to industry in the Medellin area),
the power sector and the Government are studying the tariff structure
and the rates with a view toward power pricing that reflects
approximately the cost of supply to each consumer category (1.11).
An important step in this direction has been taken by EEEB under the
Bank loan for the Mesitas project. EEEB has agreed to introduce



- 12 -
gradually revised tariff structures and rates in accordance with the
above principle between April 1980 and June 1982. The implementation
of the agreed recommendations of the tariff study under San Carlos I
would be a major objective of further Bank lending in the sector.
Constraints on Sector Development
1.29      In the past, the large number of entities associated with the
power sector, the lack of adequate regulation, coordination and planning
at the national level and low electricity rates constrained the sector's
ability to make rational use of Colombia's abundant hydroelectric resources.
The regionalized nature of the sector, reflecting the political and economic
decentralization of Colombia, precluded technical cooperation and engendered
difficulties in coordinating investment allocation; decisions were made on a
local basis without due regard to overall country planning for power develop-
ment. This, together with the lack of funds, resulted in recurring power
shortages, a problem that will not be solved before well into the early
eighties, and then only if the agreed development program is implemented
expeditiously (the latter in turn, being largely dependent on adequate rate
setting). To date, the sector's organization has precluded the usual practice
of diverting resources from well-developed urban markets to support service in
rural areas (1.26).
1.30      The Government has recently taken a number of positive measures
to address the sector's institutional constraints. In 1975, it eliminated
the jurisdictional overlap between ICEL and CORELCA on the Atlantic Coast
by transferring control over the electricity distribution companies in
that region to CORELCA. Another positive measure was the reorientation
of ICEL, which in future will be responsible basically for electricity
development in rural and semi-rural areas, where the Government will
continue to subsidize the service since ICEL cannot be financially self-
supporting in those areas. In order to remedy the problems that exist
between the generating and distributing companies in the Cauca Valley,
as a consequence of the complex organization of electricity service in that
region, the Government has supported the establishment of a regional
power company whose basic function will be to consolidate that region's
electricity sector in a single enterprise (2.15). With the incorporation
of CORELCA into ISA, most of the sector is represented directly or in-
directly in ISA's Board and a better coordination of power sector planning
in Colombia is now possible. ISA's effectiveness in achieving this
coordination, however, will depend on its ability to sustain the consensus
developed over the past 2 years among its shareholders.
2. ISA AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS
ISA
2.01      Interconexion Electrica S.A. (ISA) would be the Borrower for the
proposed San Carlos II Hydro Power Loan. ISA is a public corporation estab-
lished in 1967 and is responsible for the expansion and operation of the inter-
connected transmission system and generating plant of national significance.

2.02      Bylaws.  ISA's shareholders, and their holdings as of December 31,
1978 are:
Utility                      Shares                       %
EEEB                          4,876                     25.0

1/   A CVC subsidiary - see 2.15.
2/   Central Hidroelectrica de Caldas, an ICEL subsidiary.
ISA's bylaws, which are consistent with the decentralized structure of the
power sector, give it many regulatory and planning functions. They also
contain important provisions with regard to the financing of the major
generation projects entrusted to ISA (Chapter 4). Under the previous
loans, ISA has agreed to secure the concurrence of the Bank before amend-
ments are introduced in the bylaws; this covenant has been repeated in
the agreements for the proposed loan.
2.03      Organization and Administration.  ISA is administered by its
Shareholder Assembly, a 5-member Board of Directors and a General Manager.
The Assembly must act on all major issues, and decision-making may be
slow as the interests of the various shareholders sometimes differ. To
ensure that decisions are based on a consensus, ISA's bylaws specify that
the decisions of the Shareholders Assembly require the concurrence of 75%
of the shares.
2.04      The General Manager, who is appointed by the Board of Directors
for a 2-year term, renewable indefinitely, is in charge of the day-to-day
management of the company. He is assisted by the chiefs of four depart-
ments (Technical, Operations, Finance and Administration). ISA's present
organization is adequate (Annex 2.1) but future recruitment of experts
may be increasingly difficult (2.05; 4.17). With the help of consultants,
it has handled well the technical and administrative aspects of the 230-kV
Interconnection and Chivor I, and the 500-kV Interconnection and San Carlos I.
It is not expected to encounter major problems in implementing the proposed
project. ISA's transmission facilities and Chivor I are being operated
satisfactorily. Financial planning has improved following the recent
creation of the Finance Department. In 1977/78 ISA's main office was
transferred from Bogota to Medellin, a consequence of the Government's
decentralization policy. The transfer should prove generally advantageous,
as ISA's major projects for the foreseeable future will be closer to
Medellin than to Bogota.



- 14 -
2.05      Employment and Training.  ISA's professional staff is suffi-
ciently large (about 500 out of a total of 800 people) and experienced
to handle its present responsibilities and its pay levels are satisfactory.
ISA has a satisfactory general training program at various national
institutions. However, in view of the rapid growth of the sector, the
need for staff trained in special areas (e.g. hydrology, soil and rock
mechanics, ecology, etc.), which are not taught at graduate level at the
universities, is expected to outstrip available supply of qualified
manpower. Thus, the proposed loan would finance a necessary study to
determine training requirements as well as the carrying out of a sub-
sequent training program (4.17).
2.06      Accounting and Auditing.  ISA's accounting and data processing
systems are good. Its monthly financial statements are produced promptly
and contain the required data. ISA is reorganizing its internal auditing
office to ensure that its auditing procedures keep pace with the company's
growth.
2.07      Until 1975, ISA's annual financial statements were audited by
independent external auditors acceptable to the Bank. In compliance with
Government regulations, ISA's financial statements for 1976 and subsequent
years are audited by the Office of the Comptroller of the Republic. How-
ever, because this audit does not satisfy the Bank's requirements, the
financial statements since 1976 have also been audited by an independent
auditor, Cuellar, Feged and Ci., which is satisfactory. Under San Carlos I,
ISA agreed that independent auditors, acceptable to the Bank, will continue
to be used and that audited financial statements, together with a detailed
auditor's report, will be submitted to the Bank within 4 months of the end
of each financial year. This undertaking has been repeated in the
proposed agreements for San Carlos II.
2.08      Insurance.  ISA's transmission facilities are insured in
accordance with sound utility practice and appropriate insurance was
taken out for the Chivor I project before June 30, 1978 as required under
the agreements for the San Carlos I project.
2.09      Prior Bank Lending.  ISA has received three Bank loans totalling
MUS$196.3. The first (Loan 575-CO for MUS$18) was made in 1968 to finance
part of the foreign cost of the 230-kV Interconnection Project, which linked
ISA's original shareholders, and a series of hydroelectric studies. The
interconnection was completed in 1972 at a cost below the appraisal estimate
and the Bank agreed that the savings could be used to finance the 230-kV
Guatape-Barrancabermeja transmission line. Studies of the Cauca and
Saldana rivers were respectively completed by Integral (Colombia) and
Compania de Estudios e Interventorias (CEI, Colombia), and a feasibility
study of the Betania hydroelectric project by the consortium Sedic
(Colombia) - Harza (US); a feasibility study of the Sogamoso hydroelectric
project was carried out by a consortium comprising Hidroestudios (Colombia)
and Harza (US) and a feasibility study of projects on the Guavio river was
carried out by Ingetec (Colombia); similarly a study of projects on the Rio
Sinu basin in the Atlantic region was completed by the Consorcio Alto Sinu



- 15 -
(Colombia)- Chas. T. Main (US). As a result of these studies, a project on
the Guavio river (1,600 MW), two on the Rio Sinu (Urra I, 340 MW; Urra II, 710
MW) and one on the Rio Magdalena (Betania, 618 MW) have been identified and
included in ISA's long-term development program.
2.10      The second loan (681-CO for MUS$52.3) was made in 1970 to finance
part of the foreign cost of the 500-MW Chivor I Hydroelectric Project, ISA's
first power station. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) made a MUS$35
loan for the project, and is providing MUS$48.5 in financing for Chivor II,
which would add a further 500 MW capacity for operation in 1980/81. Chivor I
was completed in mid-1977 (Project Completion Report dated February 1979), two
years behind schedule, with a cost overrun of approximately MUS$86 (75%). The
delay was due mainly to a contractor defaulting on construction targets (and
being replaced) and to geological problems encountered during construction of
the project's dam and tunnel. The cost overruns resulted from these problems,
from higher-than-expected bid prices and particularly from Colombian and
foreign inflation.
2.11      The Completion Reports on the 230-kV interconnection project and
the Chivor I project have been prepared as a single report (February 1979).
It concludes that the projects underwent engineering, physical, financial
and institutional difficulties. The estimation of operational and invest-
ment requirements for an institution so financially dependent as ISA, without
provisions for price contingencies in an inflationary environment led to
severe financial difficulties. The shareholders had to redefine their role
in the sector and, in the process, execution of the projects was delayed.
The experience gained under these projects has had a considerable impact on
the shaping of Bank policy for further lending for San Carlos I. Adequate
provisions for price contingencies have been introduced; local financing is
being secured through long-term financial commitments-of the shareholders to
ISA; improved financial planning was instituted by ISA and its shareholders
as well as continuous monitoring of their financial performance.
2.12      The third loan (1582-CO for MUS$126) was made in 1978 for the
San Carlos I project. IDB made a MUS$60 loan for the project, mainly to
finance the dam. Main works were bid in intensive international competi-
tion and total costs are expected to remain well below the original
estimate (4.06). Main civil works, which started in May 1977 are on
schedule.
ISA's Shareholders
2.13      ISA's shareholders (Annex 2.2), which are satisfactorily perform-
ing the obligations agreed to under the San Carlos I project, fall into
two categories:
(a) The two major municipal utilities, EEEB and EPM, which own
50% of ISA shares; and
(b) The three National Government utilities, CVC, ICEL and
CORELCA, which together with their subsidiaries, own the
balance.



- 16 -
2.14      EEEB and EPM, the municipal utilities, have been generally success-
full and relatively well-managed. Both serve concentrated urban markets in
Colombia's two largest urban areas and have access to low-cost sources of
power. In 1974-75, EPM encountered some difficulties as a result of political
interference in management and both utilities' finances were adversely
affected by low power rates. These problems have now been corrected, and
EEEB and EPM's performance is expected to continue to improve. The other
three major shareholders of ISA have in the past been less successful than
EEEB and EPM as a result of the less affluent markets they serve and the
complexity of their organizations.
2.15      CVC is an autonomous corporation which, together with other
regional development corporations, reports to NPD. It is responsible
for multipurpose development of the Cauca Valley. It is active in the
fields of power, coal mining, irrigation, rural development and hotel
operation. The largest city in the Cauca Valley, Cali, is served by a
municipally-owned utility, EMCALI. Most of the other important communities
in the area are served by CVC directly or through 26 subsidiaries. CVC owns
65% of the shares of CHIDRAL, the principal bulk power supplier in the area;
the balance of the shares are owned by EMCALI and the Municipality of Cali.
CVC and EMCALI have agreed to set up a new regional power company to take
charge of power generation and transmission in the Cauca Valley. They have
expressed their intention of consulting their creditors (among which the
Bank is included as a result of its early power loans to CVC and CHIDRAL -
see Annex 1.1 - and its more recent loans to.EMCALI for water supply:
682-CO and 1523-CO in 1970 and 1978, respectively).
2.16      ICEL is a government institute reporting to the Ministry of
Mines and Energy. Through 11 subsidiaries, ICEL is responsible for
power development in most of the country, with the exception of the
areas covered by CVC, CORELCA and the various municipal utilities.
ICEL's subsidiaries are expected to become the major users of the output
of the San Carlos I and II projects. To enhance their efficiency, ICEL
under the San Carlos I project agreed to take all necessary action to
strengthen the management, planning, operations and finances of its
subsidiaries and to formulate an improvement program. ICEL's central
staff is conducting a study of at least five of its subsidiaries which
will be presented to the Bank, together with its proposals for implementa-
tion, by March 31, 1980. Implementation of the proposals, with any
modifications resulting from the comments of the Bank is expected to be
completed by December 31, 1981.
2.17      The Bank has recognized that, although little is known about
the technical and financial situation of ICEL and its subsidiaries, the
manpower required to obtain the relevant data would be prohibitive at
this stage. Furthermore, as ICEL's incremental market would be largely
among the lower-income rural population, the conclusions of such investiga-
tion have been judged unlikely to uncover significant possibilities for
increasing the sector's overall financial viability. Thus, the Government
undertook to cover ICEL's contributions to ISA for the San Carlos I
project in the event the company would be unable to make timely payments.



- 17 -
In the interim, ICEL has agreed to provide available financial informa-
tion to the Bank 1/, which is expected to provide a somewhat fuller
picture of the power sector but would not be sufficient basis for
determining ICEL's capacity to meet its financial commitments to ISA,
including power purchases (estimated at 45% of the San Carlos I and II
output). Thus, assurances have been obtained from the Government that
such commitments would be met timely, and the relevant undertaking under
San Carlos I has been amended to include ICEL's commitment to ISA for
purchase of power.
2.18      CORELCA is a government-owned corporation reporting to the Ministry
of Mines and Energy. It is responsible for generation, bulk supply and the
coordination of power development in Colombia's Atlantic Coast region. The
newest of ISA's shareholders, it has been functioning since 1972 and in 1975
took over ICEL's controlling interest in the 7 local utilities serving the
area. In order to increase its effectiveness in handling its rapidly growing
operations, under the San Carlos I project, CORELCA has agreed to strengthen
its management and finances. To this end, it would carry out a study with
the assistance of consultants acting under terms of reference acceptable to
the Bank. The terms of reference for this study, for which proposals were
received in early October 1979, discussed with CORELCA. As a result, under
the proposed loan, the study has been extended to also include CORELCA's 3
largest subsidiaries. CORELCA would furnish for comments, by December 31,
1979, to the Government and the Bank, the conclusions of the study related to
CORELCA itself and by June 30, 1980 the conclusions related to the subsidiaries,
together with its proposals for implementation. By March 31, 1981, CORELCA
would carry out a program with respect to its own improvements, and by
September 30, 1981, with respect to improvements of the subsidiaries, all
based on its proposals and the Government's and the Bank's comments thereon.
3. THE POWER MARKET
Historic
3.01      In 1977, total electricity requirements in the country were about
15.3 TWh 2/. Of this, the Central Market system (serving the Pacific Coast
and the interior), through the main utilities ISA, EEEB, EPM, EMCALI and
various subsidiaries of CVC and ICEL, accounted for about 79% (12.0 TWh);
the Atlantic Coast system (CORELCA and subsidiaries) about 14% (about
2.2 TWh); and the self producers about 7% (1.1 TWh).
1/   ISA, on behalf of the Bank, is presently executing a preliminary
review of ICEL's investment program, operations, and finances.
2/   Estimated by ISA.  Although ICEL annually prepares a statistical year
book for the sector, not all production is included due to lack of
data and the information given is sometimes at variance with data
obtained by ISA directly and reflected in the San Carlos I appraisal
report; for this report, ISA amended the San Carlos I data accordingly.



- 18-
3.02      The overall 1972-77 power data for ISA's shareholders (Annex 3.1)
is summarized as follows:
Unadjusted

Maximum demand (MW)         1,810            2,165        2,737              8.6
Sales (total) (GWh)         7,600 (100%)    9,179        11,343 (100%)       8.3
Residential               2,981 (39%)      3,777        4,803 (42%)       10.0
Commercial                  942 (12%)      1,214        1,545 (14%)       10.4
Industrial                2,628 (35%)      3,139        3,708 (33%)       7.1
Others                    1,049 (14%)      1,049        1,289 (11%)        4.2
Losses (%) 1/               19.0             16.1         20.1
Over 1971-1977 the public sector's growth rate of electricity production
(adjusted to reflect curtailments in 1977, see para. 3.03), was about 9.8%
compared with a GNP growth rate of 6%/a. Growth of sales, which averaged
9.5%/a, varied from 7.2%/a for the EPM system to 11% for EEEB's system. The
pattern of supply and demand has not changed materially: the share of each
system in the market has hardly varied. Commerce and industry together had
the same share in 1977 as in 1972; residential consumption increased by 3
percentage points while "Others" declined by 3 percentage points. The
rather large difference in the 5-year growth pattern of generation compared
with sales appears to be due to the increase in losses in 1977. In view of
the importance of reducing losses to a minimum, ISA has undertaken, under the
San Carlos I loan, a study of the nature, size and occurrence of losses in
its own system and those of its shareholders (1.11). The study is expected
to make recommendations for reduction of losses and (if required) improved
metering systems.
3.03      During late 1976 and early 1977 supply was seriously rationed
(up to 10% of requirements could not be met during the 5-month dry season
depending on the supply area) in the Central Interconnected System, parti-
cularly in the areas served by CVC and CHEC. The 1976/77 rainy season
was unusually dry, and commissioning of Chivor I hydro and the thermal plant
at Barranca were delayed. Supply was also rationed in the Atlantic system
due to the gas shortage resulting from delayed completion of a gas pipeline
to Barranquilla.

Forecasts
3.04      Projected demand and energy requirements are based on ISA's
detailed analysis of past consumption trends in the market served by each of
its shareholders and on a study of the correlation between power sector
growth and growth of GNP at rates of 6%, 6.5% and 7%, adjusted for large
expected consumers in the various regions. From 1981 onward the Central
and Atlantic systems are considered as integrated in view of the planned
completion of the 500-kV Interconnection Project. ISA is presently studying,
with the assistance of consultants, the application of a multiple regression
model reflecting social and economic factors closely correlated with growth
of electricity.
3.05      The 1977-85 electricity requirements in the interconnected system
are expected to grow at an average of 10.6%/a (over the adjusted 1977
figures) in accordance with historic trends. As a result (Annex 3.2),
gross energy requirements of the systems would be the following:

1978    4,388   3,819   2,367   3,665        2,431        16,660       3,182
1980    5,320   4,467   2,812   4,805        3,262       20,666        3,925
1983    7,073   5,733   3,600   6,167        5,010       27,583        5,182
1985    8,559   6,684   4,246   7,337        6,222       33,048        6,246
This forecast, which is about equal to the forecast made in 1977 for San
Carlos I, appears reasonable, except that ICEL and CORELCA's average growth
rates appear high at almost 13%/a. As a result of the ongoing studies for
these systems (2.16; 2.18) those rates may be adjusted downward in the
future.
Balances of Capacities and Energies
3.06      In order to meet the forecast power requirements in the national
interconnected system by 1985, about 4,500 MW in effective generating
capacity would have to be added to the 3,440 MW available at the end of
1977. The 1977-85 balances for energies and capacities are shown in
Annex 3.3 for average water availability. Summarized, they show the follow-
ing:

in Annex 3.1 represent the losses in ISA's system.

3.07      In the Central System, due to delays in plant construction, the
capacity margin is expected to deteriorate until interconnection. The
meeting of peak demand will be difficult (even if ICEL's requirements would
remain below expectations - see para. 3.05) if any of the years through 1981
would be exceptionally dry and, in this event, depending on actual load
growth, further emergency measures may be necessary (4.02). Until intercon-
nection, CORELCA's situation will also be difficult if its forecast of peak
demand materializes (3.05). However, its energy requirements (except during
the time of the forecast peak) can probably be met. After interconnection
the emergency works begun in 1978 (additional thermal plant and river diver-
sions) would start to alleviate the situation by 1982, even if hydrological
conditions are below average. With the advancement of the thermal plants
Cerrajon II and Tasajero (4.02), the overall capacity margin would improve by
1983/84 to an adequate level of some 24%. ISA's simulation studies indicate
that during 1982-85, the energy shortfalls would be small (1 in 20 years
probability):

1984               7/-
1985              14/0.4
Some small unexpected delays in plant completion would not substantially
affect supply conditions from 1982 onward.
3.08      With the commissioning of Chivor I (Loan 681-CO) in September 1977,
ISA for the first time generated energy in the interconnected system. Its
generation is expected to rise rapidly, from 1.0 TWh in 1977 to some 11 TWh
in 1985, when it would meet about 33% of total requirements:

3.09      Under average hydrological conditions the energy to be transferred
from the Central to the Atlantic system (i.e. the net energy to be sold by
ISA to CORELCA) would be relatively small. However, actual transfers are
expected to aggregate some 1.1-1.3 TWh by 1984/85, representing an average
capacity of 125-150 MW, taking into account actual hydro conditions, least
cost dispatch, and mutual assistance requirements.

4.02      All of the above plants have been approved by ISA's board, except
Betania. Not shown are river diversion works to increase generation, such
as Chingaza (EAAB/EEEB), Pajarito, Nechi and Dolores (EPM) and Tunjita (ISA),
and the 500-kV project (Loan 1583-CO) to interconnect the Central System (ISA)
with the Atlantic System (CORELCA). Of the total, installed capacity of
4,766 MW (effective capacity about 4,500 MW, see para. 3.06) to be commis-
sioned by 1985, ISA would construct 2,491 MW, or 52% in accordance with this
plan. In view of a possible critical situation in 1980/81, earliest acquisi-
tion of at least 150 MW in gas turbine capacity for the central system is
under discussion in ISA's board and a decision is expected soon. Similarly,
in order to avoid possible shortages in 1983/84, a decision is expected to
advance construction of thermal plant at Tasajero (ICEL) and Cerrejon (CORELCA)
up to 2 years.
4.03      ISA Development.  ISA's part of the 1978-85 development program,
i.e., including future plant on which construction has to start before 1985,
is expected to cost about US$3.6 billion in current prices (US$2.2 billion in
end-1977 prices), excluding interest during construction. The program which
is shown in Annex 4.1 is summarized, in current prices, in the table below,
which also provides information on the incremental capacity and approximate
incremental energy capability resulting from the program by the end of 1983.

The Project
4.04      The San Carlos hydro plant is located in northwest Colombia at
the confluence of the San Carlos and Guatape rivers, downstream of the outlet
of EPM's existing Guatape Hydro plant (Annex 4.2) at a distance of 150 km east
from the city of Medellin by a road of which 60 km are paved; the remaining 90
km correspond to a serviceable all weather road suitable for weights up to 60
tons. The first phase of the San Carlos plant is being constructed in accor-
dance with the implementation schedule agreed to under the San Carlos I loan.
The work comprises the Punchina dam on the Guatape river, inlet and discharge
tunnels and an underground power station suitable for ten 155 MW generating
units in one cavern and their transformers in a second cavern. Four units will
be installed during the first phase. All main civil work will be completed
during the first phase (subject to the provisions of financing described in
paragraph 4.06). The second phase, which is included in the proposed Project,
would add 4 additional generating units (620 MW) and related facilities. The
two remaining units would be installed when required for peaking purposes, which
is not expected before 1985. The output of both Guatape and San Carlos would be
regulated by the large Santa Rita reservoir (which was expanded under Loan 874-CO
to EPM, with filling of the reservoir to the new level begun in May 1978). The
second phase of San Carlos is required for peaking purposes and for additional
generation related to the additional diversion of Nare river waters to the
Guatape river through the Jaguas Hydro plant (to be completed at the same time
as San Carlos II) which is being financed by IDB. In order to transmit the
additional capacity and energy throughout the interconnected system, a second
230-kV line will be required between San Carlos and Medellin, and between
Esmeralda and Yumbo for supply to the area of Cali in the south, both of which
form part of the Project. In addition the Project would include a study to
identify the requirements for least cost dispatching and training in the
interconnected system, and a study and training program for other staff.
4.05      The possibility of diverting the Calderas and Tafetanes rivers
(5-6 m3/s) to the San Carlos river was already identified in 1973 in the
San Carlos feasibility study. The feasibility study shows that total genera-
tion in a small (15 MW) plant near the top of the San Carlos reservoir and at
the San Carlos plant would be about 345 GWh/a of which 255 GWh pertain to the
Calderas river diversion and 90 GWh to the Tafetanes river diversion. The
Calderas facilities would also be financed by the loan in view of its economic
benefits. Its cost (MUS$22) would be about 5% of the cost of San Carlos,
while increasing the San Carlos generation by about 6% (excluding Jaguas'
contribution). The Tafetanes diversion, to be completed at a later date, also
appears justified since its cost (MUS$5.5) would be about 25% of the cost of
Calderas, while generation would increase by 90 GWh or 35% of the Calderas
contribution. Consequently, the Calderas plant has been designed for the
combined flow to be diverted from both rivers to the San Carlos reservoir at
an extra cost of about MUS$1.5.
4.06      The San Carlos I Project (1582-CO).  International competitive
bidding for the San Carlos I civil works resulted in lower costs, particularly

foreign, than estimated during appraisal; current estimates of internal infla-
tion are also lower than the projections used for San Carlos 1. Thus, sub-
stantial savings would be realized under that loan. The original and adjusted
estimates (Annex 4.3) are summarized below:

Loan 1582-CO was made to ISA for the amount of MUS$126 to cover the foreign
cost of the San Carlos I underground works (the dam is being financed by
IDB), miscellaneous hydro-mechanical equipment, transmission, and interest
during construction. However, in accordance with the revised estimate,
only some MUS$90 would be required from the loan account. Thus, loan 1582-CO
would cover the foreign cost of the underground works required for San Carlos
II (i.e., the second power tunnel). This would avoid cancellation of some
MUS$36 and the loan for San Carlos II has been adjusted accordingly. Both
loans combined would thus finance the works for San Carlos I and II in two
tranches, as originally envisioned. The presently estimated cost of San
Carlos 1, including the underground work for San Carlos II takes into account
the contractor's discount of 10% on the underground works contract for San
Carlos II, provided that ISA accepts, as anticipated, the option within
16 months after the signing of the base contract for San Carlos I (May 1978).
4.07      Objectives.  The Bank would continue promoting the sector and
project objectives supported under San Carlos I:
(a)  to enhance ISA's role as the agency, operating throughout the
country on behalf of the main utilities, to harness the larger hydro
potentials for meeting future power requirements;
(b)  to coordinate through ISA sound overall sectoral development;
(c)  through ISA, as dispatch agency, to enable the efficient and economic
operation of the interconnected system, including the CORELCA System
where, after completion of the 500-kV interconnection project
presently in execution, part of the expensive thermal generation
would be replaced by hydro generation available in the Central
System; and
1/   The decrease is substantially due to lower assumptions for both local
and foreign inflation.  Local inflation averaged 23.6% in 1975, 20.0%
in 1976 and 34.7% in 1977, and is expected to average about 18% in
1978, decreasing to 12% by 1981.

(d) to encourage the financial viability of the various entities in
the sector, and to institute operational policies (including
administration and accounting) designed to increase efficiency
and allow the monitoring of performance on a common basis, through-
out the sector.
4.08       Description.  The San Carlos plant will use an average discharge
of 143 m3/s (Annex 4.2) supplied by the Guatape river and the flows diverted
from the Nare river, through the Guatape and Jaguas hydro stations, and from
the Calderas river through the Calderas hydro station. The project comprises:

(b) Two 3-phase banks of single-phase transformers, each 122 MVA,
16/230 kV, water-cooled. Two generating sets will be connected to
each bank;
(c) Electrical equipment related to the 4 additional generators includ-
ing control boards, auxiliary panels, cables, and expansion of the
San Carlos switchyard;

which will be steel lined, with a crosssection of 5.9 m2; and
(b) A surface power station with two Francis type turbine - generators
of 7.7 MW each, operating at a gross head of 210 m and ancillary
equipment including transformers to connect the station to the
existing 44-kV line San Carlos-Granada at a distance of 1 km.

4.10      The cost estimate is based largely on prices for the main contracts
already awarded for San Carlos I, (civil works) or already evaluated (turbines
and generators). The physical contingencies for local cost have been estimated
to average about 12% for San Carlos II and 18% for Calderas; for foreign cost,
10% for San Carlos II and 15% for Calderas.  These percentages are considered
appropriate in view of the advanced status of the design and contracting
(including options, see paras 4.06 and 4.12) of San Carlos and the preliminary
design stage of Calderas. The estimated base cost is in prices calculated
for early 1978, to which a contingency has been added for inflation as follows:
local cost was assumed to decrease from 18% in 1978 to 12% in 1981, remaining
constant thereafter; foreign cost 7% in 1978, 6.5% in 1979 and 6% thereafter.
The average exchange rate (Col$39.10 per US$ in 1978) was assumed to increase
to Col$60.51 by 1985.
4.11      Financing.  A Bank loan of MUS$72 is proposed, representing 65% of
the foreign exchange component of MUS$110.5 as follows:

4.12      Under bids made for the San Carlos I turbines and generators (for
which the award is pending, awaiting Government agreement), ISA would have
an option to acquire four additional units and obtain suppliers' credit
financing amounting to about MUS$30.1.  ISA's shareholders would finance the
remaining foreign cost (MUS$8.4) comprising mainly the down payments on
suppliers' credit financed items and price contingencies for these items not
financed by suppliers. The local cost would be financed by equity contribu-
tions and equity securities to be subscribed by ISA shareholders and internally
generated funds.
Engineering; Studies; Training
4.13      San Carlos II.  With Bank agreement, ISA has retained the services
of the Colombian consultants firm Integral for final design and supervision of
construction of both San Carlos I and II. Integral has already engaged
outside expertise for special4zed tasks during construction of San Carlos I
and this policy will be continued for San Carlos II. The proposed loan would
finance, similarly to San Carlos I, the foreign cost, or 50% of the total
cost, of Integral's services, estimated at MUS$5. The estimated base cost of
engineering services for San Carlos II is MUS$3.8-4.0. The consultants are
paid on the basis of the cost of all personnel assigned from time to time to
the project, including salary costs social benefits and a profit margin.



- 29 -
Their present base salaries average about US$670/month. It is estimated
that some 5,300 man.months of such services will be required. Super-
vision of the underground work for the second tunnel (the civil works of
which would be financed by Loan 1582-CO for San Carlos I, see para. 4.06)
is included in this estimate.
4.14       Calderas.  At the time of appraisal, only a prefeasibility study
was available for Calderas. Since then, ISA has undertaken a crash program
for surveys and has updated the feasibility study including the cost estimate.
The Bank has engaged an expert geologist to evaluate the status of readiness
for construction of Calderas. His findings were satisfactory and risks,
within the assumed contingencies, considered minimal. Final design has been
initiated and bid documents for the main civil works are expected to be
issued by November 1979. The estimated foreign cost of the consultants
services (which also are being provided by Integral) and surveys of about
MUS$0.3 would be financed by the proposed loan. The total cost (about
MUS$1.0) includes about 750 man.months in services as defined above for San
Carlos II.
4.15       Transmission.  ISA, with the assistance of its consultants, would
design and supervise construction of the transmission lines to be financed
by the loan within the scope of its continuing transmission expansion program.
Because ISA already has considerable experience in this work, no difficulties
are expected and no particular monitoring conditions are required.
4.16       Dispatch Study.  A load dispatch center to be completed by 1981 and
financed by IDB under its loan for Chivor II expansion, will now be located
at Medellin. Although the system and its general operational objectives have
been technically well-defined, ISA has no experience with operating a system
as large as envisioned for the eighties, and the operation has not yet been
studied in depth. The contract for the supply of power from Chivor (ISA's
first power station) is limited to Chivor only and does not provide yet for
an inter-regional power sale and purchase pool. Computer programs will have
to be acquired (and modified to be applicable in the Colombian system) and
developed for operating the system at least cost, to monitor power exchanges
and operational data, institute a system of billing and sharing of benefits,
etc. A dispatch agreement between the entities operating in the system,
setting forth the responsibilities and the rights of the entities, on the
subjects outlined above will have to be prepared. Operators will have to be
trained within and outside Colombia. In order to prepare ISA for its role of
national dispatch agency, the loan would finance a study for coordinated
dispatch in the interconnected system as discussed above, including training,
the cost of which is estimated at MUS$1.5. ISA would engage the services of
consultants not later than December 31, 1979, under conditions and terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank, which would be consulted regularly and
timely on all major aspects of the study as it progresses. Proposals for the
terms of reference are being discussed with ISA. The study and training
would be completed by December 31, 1981.
4.17       Training of ISA's Staff.  ISA's professional staff, numbering
about 800, is supplemented by large numbers of consultant personnel, some
of whom are providing nonspecialized services. At the same time, ISA has no



- 30 -
plans to increase substantially its staff in order to take over work now
executed by consultants. A preliminary study of the total manpower require-
ments in the energy sector has been made, estimating that of the total of
about 7,100 needed, some 4,100 will be employed in the power sector, implying
greatly increased ISA responsibility for sector control. Although the
universities graduate engineers in sufficient annual numbers to meet these
needs, specialized graduate training in specific areas required by the sector,
such as hydrology, soil and rock mechanics, geomorphology, seismology and
ecology is not available locally. In view of the expected rapid growth of the
sector, ISA's need for specialized staff is great, not only to enable it to
adequately supervise the consultants, but to reduce gradually its reliance on
outside services where economically justified. Total staff requirements, over
the next three to four years, whether employed by ISA or by its consultants,
are estimated at about 340 engineers -- although ISA has not yet decided what
proportion of these staff should be employed by itself. The preliminary
study, however, indicates the urgency of training in general and post-graduate
studies in particular for selected ISA personnel.
4.18      As a first step towards assisting ISA to solve this problem within
the limits of its absorbing capacity, the proposed loan, at an estimated
cost of MUS$2, would finance:
(a)  a study of ISA's manpower requirements up to 1985.  For this
purpose, ISA would engage, by December 31, 1979, the services
of expert consultants, under terms and conditions acceptable to
the Bank, to complete the study by June 30, 1980 for review
and discussion with the Bank. The study, which would also review
the present capability of Colombia's educational programs to meet
the requirements of the power sector, would make recommendations
for (i) the creation, organization and staffing of a manpower and
training department in ISA; (ii) a training program to be imple-
mented for new and existing staff in Colombia and abroad, clearly
stating the objectives, numbers and specializations of staff
required, together with an appropriate time-scale; (iii) identify
programs and resources, through which such training can be
obtained most efficiently; (iv) identify existing staff capable
of absorbing such training in each specialty; (v) provide job
descriptions (and minimum educational requirements) for staff to
be recruited for further training in specific specializations;
and (vi) conditions of employment, including the long-term
contracting of trainees, plus an evaluation of all training
programs both during and at completion; and
(b)  the implementation of an agreed training program to be completed
by June 30, 1983; the proposed loan should finance 50% of the
cost of training in Colombia and 100% of the foreign cost of
training elsewhere.
4.19      The cost estimate is based on the assumption that 60-70 staff of
ISA would be trained outside Colombia for a period of two years at an annual
cost of US$10,000/man.year, about MUS$0.5 would be spent in Colombia for
training and MUS$0.2 would be required for the consultant study. A further



- 31 -
objective is to ensure that ISA's manpower and training department would be
capable, in the future, of developing further recruitment and training
programs.
4.20      Retroactive Financing.  Consulting services for San Carlos were all
charged to San Carlos I until September 31, 1978 and, during appraisal, it was
agreed that services for San Carlos I and II would be separated administra-
tively. For this reason, retroactive financing is proposed, not exceeding
MUS$l for engineering services incurred since October 1, 1978 for San Carlos II
and Calderas.
4.21      Implementation Schedule.  The construction schedule of the San
Carlos II Project would largely overlap construction of the San Carlos I
Project (completion mid-1982) and works are expected to be completed by
mid-1984. The project implementation schedule, of which key dates are shown
in Annex 4.4, would be used to monitor progress during the construction
period; this schedule also covers the transmission lines and the studies.
4.22      Procurement.  Procurement of goods and services to be financed by
the proposed loan (other than consulting services and training) would be
through international competitive bidding under Bank guidelines for procurement.
Colombian manufacturers would receive a preference of 15%, or applicable duties,
whichever is lower, for purposes of bid evaluation. The cost estimate assumes
that local manufacturers would supply conductors, towers and some miscellaneous
electromechanical equipment, with an estimated cost of about MUS$10-12, the
ex-factory cost (net of taxes) of which would be financed by the loan.
4.23      Disbursements.  Funds from the proposed loan would finance (a) 100%
of the foreign expenditures for imported equipment, materials and ancillary
works and services; (b) 100% of the foreign cost of civil works for Calderas;
(c) the foreign expenditures for consultant's services or 50% of total;
(d) 50% of the cost of surveys and drilling, (e) 94% of the ex-factory cost of
locally produced materials and equipment, and (f) 50% of the cost of training
in Colombia and 100% of the foreign cost of training abroad. Annex 4.5 shows
the estimated loan disbursements. The first unit (i.e. the fifth in the San
Carlos Power Station) is expected to be operational in September 1983 and the
project would be completed by June 30, 1984. The closing date would be June
30, 1985 to allow for payment of retention monies and some unforeseen delays.
Environmental Aspects
4.24      The agreements reached under San Carlos I, with respect to
protection of the environment, have been repeated in the agreements for
the proposed loan:
(a)  Taking of all necessary measures to ensure the project is carried
out with due regard to ecological and environmental factors;
(b)  Evacuation of the areas of the San Carlos work areas to be
completed by June 30, 1979;
(c)  Acquisition of all land and rights in respect of land required
for the carrying out of the San Carlos project by December 31,
1979;



- 32 -
(d)  Monitoring and inspection of dams at least once a year by qualified
and experienced experts; and
(e)  Preparation of a program for rational use of the project basins by
December 31, 1980 and establishment of a unit by December 31, 1984,
for carrying out the program.
4.25      In addition to the above, ISA has agreed to carry out, by December 31,
1980, a plan, satisfactory to the Bank, for the evacuation of the areas where
the works included in the San Carlos II project will be carried out. By the same
date it would acquire all lands and rights in these areas and by December 31,
1981 all other lands and rights in respect of land required for the carrying
out of the project.
Project Risks
4.26      Because the project, except for the transmission lines, cover
substantially the San Carlos area, the physical risks are practically equal
to those of the San Carlos I project, which are summarized as follows:
(a)  Climatic conditions.  The main effect of climatic conditions on
the project is that progress largely depends on completion of
specific items (e.g. cofferdams) during the five months dry season
in order to avoid interruption of operations during floods. Work
has progressed as scheduled and no major difficulties are expected
in this respect.
(b)  Geology.  The facilities are, for the greater part, located on
or in sound igneous rocks and only a small portion of tunnelling
would be done across fault zones. The first power tunnel will
be concrete-lined throughout for protection against blasting in the
second tunnel; the latter will be concrete-lined only to the extent
necessary in view of rock conditions found and across fault zones.
The surveys for the exact location of the powerhouse caverns have
been completed and exploratory tunnels are being constructed for the
length of the caverns to ascertain rock conditions more precisely,
before blasting of the caverns is started. ISA has engaged the
services of consultants to provide assistance during construction
to monitor geological conditions and solve problems related to it;
they are Soil and Rock Instrumentation of Boston, Dr. A. Merrit - a
U.S. Engineering Geologist, Mr. J.L. Sherard of Bermuda - a dam
consultant and Mr. W. Clyde - a U.S. Seismic Expert.
(c)  Seismicity.  Although there are a number of faults in the area,
only two of them are classified as probably active (although there
is little evidence). The works have been designed for a seismic
acceleration of 0.4 g (3.9 m/s2) with its epicenter in one of the
faults and a spectrum to the October 1960 earthquake in Lima, Peru.
The dam will be monitored continuously (4.24).

5. FINANCES
Introduction
5.01      ISA depends on its shareholders to finance its operations through
energy sales and service charges, and to finance the portion of its invest-
ments not covered by loans through equity shares and securities contributions.
Since its incorporation in 1967 and particularly during the period 1971-1977,
ISA encountered major problems whenever its shareholders had financial diffi-
culties (as a consequence of their low rates). Since January 1978 the finances
of ISA and its shareholders have improved substantially as noted in paragraph
5.02 below. No financial difficulties are expected through 1985, the end of
the forecast period provided that current application of adequate tariff
policies are maintained, together with Government contributions on behalf
of CORELCA and ICEL.
ISA's Performance and Financial Position
5.02      During 1967-1978 ISA functioned in accordance with its original
lylaws, which were based on the concept of sharing ISA's operating costs,
debt service and local construction expenditures among its shareholders
according to agreed formulae. The revenue covenants for IBRD loans 575-CO
and 681-CO were consistent with those provisions. 1/ ISA's main financial
problems during this period, particularly over 1971-77, resulted from slow
payment by its shareholders for amounts owed; secondary problems stemmed from
ISA's not including depreciation charges in the operating expenses recovered
from its shareholders and the tendency of some shareholders to invest in
ISA's bonds while allowing arrears to accumulate on accounts payable for
transmission charges, energy and equity contributions. The improved financial
performance of ISA and its shareholders since early 1978 resulted from
regular rate increases of up to 2.2% per month which have been sanctioned by
JNT to remain in effect through 1980. Through 1985, the end of the project
forecast period, no financial difficulties are anticipated provided that
current tariff policies are maintained and Government contributions to ISA on
behalf of ICEL and CORELCA are made in time. In support of these policies,
the agreements reached with ISA and its shareholders, under the San Carlos I
loan with respect to investments and financial arrangements, have been
repeated in the agreements for the proposed San Carlos II loan. The prin-
cipal undertakings of ISA and its shareholders are the following:
-    No generating plant would be constructed exceeding 200 MW (ISA)
and 100 MW (shareholders) unless economically justified;
additionally ISA would not undertake without Bank concurrence
any further project costing in excess of 2.5% of the value
of its net fixed assets;
1/   Except that they required that ISA earn a 9% rate of return on generating
assets. However, ISA's first generating plant, Chivor I, did not commence
operations until mid-1977 (at which time minimum levels of performance
agreed to under San Carlos I were being discussed).



- 34 -
The shareholders would not transfer any asset or take any action
that would interfere with compliance with their obligations to
ISA;
The shareholders would:
(i)  reimburse ISA for the cost of borrowing due to late payment
of amounts due;
(ii) give priority ranking to the various types of payments to be
made to ISA;
(iii) make scheduled payments to ISA of arrears for depreciation;
(iv) make payments to ISA within 60 days of billing.
Similarly, the Government reconfirmed that it would make available to
CVC, CORELCA and ICEL any funds they may require to fulfill their financial
obligations to ISA, and assist EEEB and EPM in securing any loans they may
require to comply with their financial obligations to ISA. Since September
1978, the above shareholders commitments have been met satisfactorily with
the exception of ICEL. As of December 31, 1978, ICEL owed for energy purchases
and transmission charges MCol$426 (equivalent to 260 days of billings, or 59%
of the total owed to ISA by its shareholders). Because ICEL's payments to ISA
for energy purchases are credited to the oldest outstanding accounts, ICEL,
as of March 31, 1979, was in arrears for its 1979 purchases. Since then ICEL
has improved its rate of payments to ISA and, through the Colombian Government,
has committed itself to become up to date in its 1979 payments to ISA by July
15, 1979. By the same date it would present to the Bank a government approved
schedule of payments to liquidate its end-1978 arrears to ISA. Regarding
payments for shares and securities subscriptions (excluding reimbursement of
the debt service of the FDE loan - see para. 5.13 - which will be collected
during 1979), as of December 31, 1978, ICEL is up to date and CORELCA owes
only some MUS$0.25.
5.03      The recent amendments of ISA's bylaws specify that ISA will earn
a reasonable rate of return on its revalued transmission and generating
assets. Also, the subsequently signed agreement for the sale and exchange
of energy from the Chivor I plant stipulates that tariff rates be based on
a 9% rate of return on revalued assets. These are major improvements over
the previous procedure, since it allows ISA to generate funds internally for
future expansion (5.07).
5.04      ISA's long-term capitalization (Annex 5.2) reflects the recently
amended provisions of its bylaws which require that a high proportion of
the foreign cost of its projects be financed by debt and a high proportion
of local costs be financed by equity (previously by debt also). As of
December 31, 1977, ISA's capitalization was:

ISA's official audited figures, include only a partial revaluation of
assets resulting from the yearly revaluation of ISA's foreign currency
liabilities. It excludes therefore the capital revaluation mentioned
in 1/ above.
ISA's relatively low 40/60 debt to equity ratio takes into account the full
revaluation of its assets. An additional improvement in ISA's capital
structure has resulted from the 1977 change in the characteristics of share-
holders' bonds features whereby they are now almost equivalent to common stock
and could be more aptly called "equity securities" 1/. Of ISA's long term
debt, 72% pertains to the Bank and IDB loans. Because ISA started generating
its own power only in the second half of 1977 its debt service coverage ratio
for that year was only 0.85. Preliminary results for 1978 show an improved rate
of about 2.18. The favorable structure of ISA's debt and the planned rate
increases through 1980 should allow it to obtain the additional debt financing
which it will need from commercial sources for its investment program (5.08).
As to equity financing, ISA's bylaws require each shareholder to make
equity contributions in the form of shares and equity securities to cover the
costs (mainly local) which cannot be obtained from other sources. While share
1/   The differences from common stock are:  (a) they have no voting rights
and (b) they rank before common stock and after current and long-term
liabilities upon liquidation of the company.

costs (mainly local) which cannot be obtained from other sources. While share
contributions are proportional to shareholdings, equity security contributions
are proportional to each shareholder's agreed participation in the output of
each plant (5.09) with the proviso that share contributions cannot be less
than 20% of the total required from the shareholders to fund any given project.
5.05       It should be observed that ISA's official financial statements
understates its equity (5.04) because, for accounting purposes, Colombian
legislation allows revaluation of assets only to offset exchange rate adjust-
ments on external borrowings. Nevertheless, for the purpose of financial
performance monitoring under the San Carlos I Project, ISA, EEEB, EPM,
CORELCA and CVC/CHIDRAL agreed to revalue fully their assets yearly and to
present to the Bank annually a report on such revaluation. The first reports
for 1977 were presented in December 1978. These agreements have been repeated
under the San Carlos II loan (5.27).
Financing Plan
5.06       ISA's 1978-1985 investment program (Chapter 4) includes:  (a) the
Project (San Carlos II); (b) the completion of Chivor I and II, San Carlos I,
500 kV Interconnection, Termozipa IV, Jaguas, various river diversions; and
(c) future expansion in generating facilities required by the national inter-
connected system and the corresponding transmission expansion. ISA's projected
sources and applications of funds up to 1984, year of completion of disburse-
ments of the San Carlos II loan, are shown in Annex 5.3. The summarized
financing plan for this period is:

5.07      During the period, ISA's net internal cash generation represents
12.5. of the investment program. This is low, but acceptable when viewed
in conjunction with the shareholders' contribution of 20.2% towards ISA's
expansion program, the latter representing an important consumers' contribution
of the main cities of Bogota, Medellin and Cali through EEEB, EPM and CVC.



- 38 -
The annual amounts contributed by each shareholder in the form of equity and
equity securities are shown in Annex 5.6.  Since ISA will not be in a position
to pay cash dividends, the shareholders agreed to reinvest any dividend on
shares and securities during construction of San Carlos I and thereafter
unless ISA would meet a debt service test of 1.5. This agreement has been
repeated under the San Carlos II loan agreement, taking into account that
all shareholders' bonds have been converted to equity securities (5.04).
5.08      In line with ISA's bylaws, the financing plan assumes that borrow-
ings would cover most of the foreign cost of San Carlos II (4.11). The terms
assumed are:
(a) San Carlos II IBRD Loan: interest 7.5%, 1/ maturity 17 years,
including 4 years of grace;
(b) Tokai Bank (through IDB); interest 9.0%, maturity 10 years,
including 3-1/2 years of grace; and
(c) supplier's credits; interest 8.5%, maturity 12 years, including 4
years of grace.
The effectiveness of the Bank loan for the San Carlos II Project would be
conditional on receipt of evidence that ISA has made satisfactory arrange-
ments for:
(i) the balance of the foreign exchange requirements of the
San Carlos II Project; and
(ii) the foreign exchange requirements of the Jaguas project.
5.09      Under San Carlos I, the shareholders agreed to guarantee principal
and interest on the Bank loan in proportion to their shareholding and to cover
the portion of the foreign costs of the project not covered by other long
term financing, as well as local costs which exceed ISA's net internal cash
generation, in the following proportions: EEEB, 19%; EPM, 22%; CVC, 16%; ICEL,
30% and CORELCA, 13%. At least 77% of these contributions would be in the
form of shares and the rest in the form of equity securities.  The same agree-
ment has been made for San Carlos II. These same proportions also apply to
the Jaguas project to be financed by IDB.
Future Finances
5.10      ISA's forecast financial statements 1978-85 (Annexes 5.1, 5.2 and
5.3), and financial indicators (Annex 5.4) are based on the assumption that
ISA operates on a sound commercial basis ensuring an adequate rate of return.
1/   The impact on the financial results of this assumption, as compared to
the 7.9% interest rate currently charged on Bank, loans, is negligible
as the project represents only some 5% of ISA', investment program over
the period.



- 39 -
Projected sales are based on a forecast (3.04) which reflects average hydro-
logical conditions. The supply of secondary hydroenergy, therefore, has not
been taken into account which, under favorable hydrological conditions, can
substitute for thermal generation, particularly in the CORELCA system once
the 500-kV line becomes operational in 1982. The forecasts are based on the
purchase of all of ISA's output as provided by the April 1978 sales agreement
which specifies the amounts of capacity and energy to be purchased in each
hydro year by each shareholder on a take-or-pay basis. This sales agreement,
finalizing of which was a condition for San Carlos I loan effectiveness, will
be in force until the expected entry into operation of Chivor II in 1980.
Thereafter, modifications would be introduced to cover forecast sales through
the commissioning of San Carlos I in 1983. Further modifications will be
introduced as new plants come on stream.
5.11      To improve its internal cash generation and sector self-financing
ratio in relation to the expansion program, ISA also projects that from 1978
its internally-generated cash, together with shareholders' contributions
would cover:
(a)  the local cost of all projects for which financing had not been
secured prior to December 31, 1978;
(b)  the portion of equipment costs of all such projects not financed by
loans or suppliers' credits; and
(c)  interest during construction on all new loans negotiated after
December 31, 1978.
In line with the agreements reached under San Carlos I, which have been
repeated for the San Carlos II loan, the above financing policy would apply
at any time that ISA would fail to meet the covenanted 1.5 debt service test
when planning to incurr new debt. Although this arrangement would not provide
ISA with sufficient debt service coverage in 1982 and 1985 (5.12, 5.13), it
would provide a mechanism for substantial improvement of ISA's liquidity.
5.12      ISA's projected rates of return (Annex 5.4) are in line with the
values agreed under the San Carlos I and 500 kV projects. With respect to the
annual debt service coverage ratio, however, ISA's finances show two distinct
periods:
(a)  The first period, 1978-1984, shows overall satisfactory results
except for 1982, in which debt service coverage drops to 1.36
because ISA assumes no tariff increase for that year since such
increase would not be required to meet the agreed rate of return.
During this period, the San Carlos I and II and Jaguas projects
become operational in 1982 and 1983, while the construction begins
on other projects in ISA's large investment program (4.01).



- 40 -
(b) The second period appears to begin in 1985 with a substantial drop
in the coverage ratio to 1.02 due to the increase in debt service
without a corresponding increase in revenues.  This is caused
by the time lag between the 4 year average grace periods assumed
in future loans and the up to 6 years construction periods required
for new plants.
Thus, while difficulties are not expected in maintaining a minimum annual
coverage ratio of 1.5 until San Carlos II is completed in 1984. a similar
statement cannot be made regarding 1985 without analyzing ISA's finances at
least until 1990, a task which would be undertaken during supervision or
preparation of possible future Bank loans.  In the meantime, wle ISA should
continue to achieve rates of return equivalent to those agreed under San
Carlos I (5.14), confirmation has been obtained that it would not, without
Bank concurrence, incur further long-term debt unless it would meet a debt
service test of at least 1.5 as agreed under San Carlos I.
5.13      ISA's projected annual debt service coverage ratio dces not take
account of the debt service related to three loans obtained from the Fondo
de Desarrollo Electrico (FDE) in 1977/78. The proceeds of these loans
(MCol$ 1,453) were applied to refinance the external debt servIce payments
and to cover foreign cost of Chivor I (overruns) and Chivor IlL According
to ISA's statutes, such application should have been covered by shareholder
contributions. The FDE refinancing was used in 1977 because of the shareholders'
financial difficulties, and in 1978 because of FDE's relatively soft lending
terms. Debt service associated with the FDE loans is not included in ISA's
debt service ratio calculation because ISA expects to obtain full reimburse-
ment from its shareholders, as reflected in the financial projections. This
assumption is in line with the shareholders' obligations under ISA's bylaws.
5.14      As a negotiating compromise under San Carlos I, two different sets
of rates of return were agreed, one based on ISA's generation and transmis-
sion assets except 500 kV, the other on the 500-kV assets. Since then, ISA's
attitude has become more favorable toward the Bank's recommendation that a
common rate of return would be advantageous because it would permit optimum
operation of the system based upon equitable distribution of all system costs
and benefits among the users. The rates of return (Annex 5.4)9 calculated by
including all of ISA's assets in the rate base, show that they are in line
with those agreed under San Carlos I. Agreement to the principle of a common
rate of return on all of ISA's revalued assets has been reached. The target,
in line with the agreement reached under San Carlos I and with ISA's own
projections would be a rate of return of not less than 8% in 1979, 9% in
1980, 11% in 1981, and 9% in 1982 and thereafter.
Financial Outlook of ISA's Shareholders
5.15      To assess the shareholders' capacity to meet their obligations
to ISA on account of capital contributions, security subscriptions and pay-
ments for the purchase of energy and transmission charges, the financial
forecasts of EEEB, EPM, CVC and CORELCA over 1978-1985 have been reviewed
(Annex 5.4). ICEL's obligations will continue to be covered with Government



- 41 -
contributions from the national budget. As under the agreements for San
Carlos I (2.12), the shareholders would not transfer any assets or take any
other action which would jeopardize compliance with their obligations to
ISA.
5.16      The financial projections of EEEB, EPM, CVC assume a rate increase
program of up to 2.2% per month (30% per year) through 1980 as approved by
JNT in October 1977. While CORELCA's projections assume rate increments of
up to 38% per year in order to meet performance targets agreed to under San
Carlos I.
EEEB
5.17      EEEB's internal cash generation during the past ten years covered
more than 50% of its annual investment needs, including substantial contribu-
tions to ISA. This may be attributed in large part to low-cost facilities
(given the area's geographic advantages for hydro generation) and the high
density of its market. The balance of the company's investment funds have
been obtained through borrowings, generally at reasonable cost; no government
funding has been required.
5.18      EEEB's 1978-1985 financial forecasts are based on the continued
application of 2.2% increases per month through 1982, and on the assumption
that the end 1982 average tariff level will be maintained in real terms
thereafter by the application of a constant yearly increase of 14%. These
assumptions are in line with those made under the Mesitas Project (approved
by the Board on November 14, 1978). Under that project, EEEB agreed to
achieve annually a specific minimum rate of return which was also included
in the San Carlos I shareholders agreement and would be maintained under San
Carlos II. Although EEEB's financial performance is expected to continue to
be satisfactory under the already agreed targets, its annual levels of
performance (Annex 5.4) estimated in February 1979 are somewhat different
from those made under the Mesitas project. These new figures reflect some
revisions to the development program made by EEEB's new senior management who
assumed office toward the end of 1978.
EPM
5.19      EPM's financial situation was unsatisfactory in 1974 and 1975; it
improved in 1976 and 1977 as a result of the application of the JNT approved
rate increases. During 1978, EPM's performance regained its former satisfactory
level.
5.20      EPM's projected performance is expected to remain satisfactory
(Annex 5.4). In order to meet its financial commitments to ISA, EPM has
projected tariff rates at levels which provide rates of return substantially
higher than the minimum values agreed to under San Carlos I. Its annual debt
service coverage ratio would exceed 1.5, except in 1979 and 1983. Although
EPM in view of the JNT approval could increase its rates by a maximum of 30%
per year through 1980, it projected only a compounded 24% for 1979, when the
annual debt service coverage would be only 1.4. Similarly, in 1983, when it
converts from an exporter of energy to other systems to an importer, EPM
assumes a rate increase of only 21% and its annual debt service coverage



- 42 -
ratio drops to 1.1 from 1.6 in 1982.  The existing debt service test covenant
under Toan 874-CO has been modified to include contributions to ISA in the
calculation of debt; thus EPM would not incurr new long term debt, without
Bank concurrence, unless its debt service test in 1979 and thereafter would
meet or exceed 1.5. EPM would also maintain rates of return as agreed under
San Carlos I.
CvC
5.21      CVC's financial situation was poor in the past because it charged
inadequate bulk rates to its main customer, EMCALI. Its 1976-77 rate of
return on revalued assets averaged less than 3% and internally generated funds
did not cover its debt service in that year. However, CVC's application of
the maximum authorized rate increase during 1978 has lead to a considerable
improvement; CVC is expected to achieve a 5.7% rate of return in 1978, in
comparison to the 5% agreed under San Carlos I (Annex 5.4). CVC's rates of
return would exceed the levels agreed under San Carlos I because of the
increased revenues required to meet its financial obligations to ISA. In
order to assure adequate availability of funds, it has been agreed that
CVC would not incur long term debt, without Bank concurrence, unless its debt
service test (including contributions to ISA) would meet at least 1.2 in
1980, 1.3 in 1981 through 1983 and 1.5 thereafter.
5.22      The main item in CVC's investment program is the Salvajina Multi-
purpose Project (4.01) which the IDB and the Japanese Government have been
requested to finance. CVC would require Government contributions of MCol$ 720
to undertake Salvajina.
CORELCA
5.23      CORELCA's system depends entirely on thermal generation.  Although
the Government subsidizes CORELCA through low fuel prices, the utility's
operating costs are substantially higher than those of other bulk suppliers in
Colombia, which generate most of their power in hydroelectric plants. In the
past these costs were not fully reflected in CORELCA's rates, and its financial
performance has been poor. Under the 500-kV interconnection project (Loan
1583-CO), the Government undertook to increase gradually the prices for fuel
purchased by CORELCA with the objective that by 1982 it would be more costly
for CORELCA to generate energy than purchase it from the Central System.
In line with this, the Government's national fuel price increase in December
1978 results in an effective 41% increase in the final price CORELCA pays.
CORELCA's forecasts, reflecting the measures agreed under San Carlos I and
the 500-kV project, and repeated under the proposed loan, are based on a
gradual elimination of the fuel subsidy, accompanied by sizeable rate increases
exceeding the JNT limits in 1979, 1980 and 1981 and designed to offset these
fuel costs and improve the utility's rate of return to the values agreed
under San Carlos I (CORELCA's final results are expected to show that the
entity has achieved a 4% rate of return in 1978, as agreed). However, as in
the past, CORELCA's insufficient cash generation in relation to its own debt
service requirements and investment commitments to ISA is expected to be



- 43 -
compensated for by Government contributions. The recommendations of the
institutional study of CORELCA provided for under San Carlos I (2.18) is
expected to be implemented by March 31, 1981 to strengthen CORELCA's management,
organization, planning and operations, including finances. Because of the
financial implications of CORELCA's tariff increase program on its subsidiaries,
to which it sells in bulk, agreement has been reached with CORELCA that the
scope of the above-mentioned study would be enlarged to cover at least the
finances and tariff aspects of its three largest subsidiaries which together
account for over 70% of CORELCA's sales (2.18). The rates of return agreed
to under San Carlos I would be maintained as well as the government guarantee
on CORELCA's timely contributions to ISA.
ICEL
5.24      ICEL functions essentially as a holding company for eleven local
power utilities which serve largely rural areas (2.16). It does not have
any revenues of its own and its expenses, debt service and investments
(including its contributions to ISA) are covered with Government budgetary
appropriations. ICEL's largest subsidiaries are currently applying monthly
tariff increases similar to those approved by other utilities. Under the San
Carlos I guarantee agreement, the Government undertook to cover ICEL's contri-
butions to ISA for the project, in the event the company would be unable to
make timely payments.
5.25      On the request of the Bank, ISA is presently executing a preliminary
review of ICEL (2.17). In the interim, ICEL has agreed to provide available
financial information to the Bank. The resulting information is expected to
provide a somewhat fuller picture of the entity but would not be sufficient
for determining ICEL's capacity to meet its financial commitments to ISA,
including energy purchases which are projected to reach 45% of ISA's sales in
1982 (5.02). Thus, assurances have been obtained from the Government that
such commitments would be met timely.
Performance Indicators and Reporting
5.26      Over the project implementation period, ISA is expected to generate
an increasing share of the power sold by its shareholders and, together with
its shareholders, to achieve generally satisfactory financial performance.
The expected performance of ISA and the shareholders is reflected in the
forecast indicators in Annex 5.4, which would be used as a basis for monitoring
performance during project execution.
5.27      Under San Carlos I, ISA and its shareholders agreed to report
quarterly on their performance in meeting targets. In addition, ISA agreed
to include in its quarterly reports on the progress of the project, detailed
information on its financial condition, the status of payments from the
Government and the shareholders to ISA. They would also provide annual
reports on asset revaluation. These reports are aimed at enabling ISA and
the Bank to identify any deviations from the agreed financial performance
early enough to permit timely corrective action. These undertakings have
been repeated under the San Carlos II loan.



- 44 -
Uniform System of Power Sector Accounts
5.28       The varied formats, criteria and presentation of financial forecasts
by ISA and its shareholders indicate that a uniform system of accounting
would be desirable, as this would facilitate sound system planning and
management. Thus, agreement has been reached that ISA and its shareholders
would undertake a study on this matter under terms of reference to be
reviewed in discussion with the Government and by the Bank. For this purpose,
the terms of reference would be submitted by December 31, 1979 and the study
would be completed by June 30, 1981.
6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
6.01       San Carlos (1240 MW) would be the largest facility in the inte-
grated system, located near the center of the load in the central system.
The station cannot be considered in isolation, since its generation depends
substantially on concurrent completion of the Jaguas hydro station (170 MW)
and diversion works and, to a lesser extent, on the Calderas hydro station.
The average annual incremental generation, once these works have been com-
pleted, broken down to show the contributions of the various rivers (Annex
4.2) and power stations, is the following:
San Carlos
(GWh)

Comparison of Alternatives
6.02       A comparison of 3 alternative development programs, prepared
for the San Carlos I project 1/ showed the economic justification of ISA's
development program, including San Carlos, having the highest proportion
of hydro development, up to a discount rate of at least 12.5%. In view of
the lower than expected cost of San Carlos, a new comparison would therefore
show a slightly higher equalizing discount rate. For this reason, and
because San Carlos is already being constructed, the calculation has not been
repeated.

6.03      Because ISA would not undertake any project in excess of 200 MW
unless economically justified (5.02), the Bank's main concern is that ISA
regularly update the economic ranking of future projects. A first report 1/,
using the method of economic comparison in accordance with least incremental
cost was submitted to the Bank in 1978. ISA recently repeated the study 2/,
this time using the discounted cash flow method of comparison, substantially
confirming the findings with respect to economic ranking of the first report.
The results of the latest study are discussed below.
6.04      Fifteen alternative power developments to meet energy requirements
through 1990 were stochastically examined with the constraint that, on the
basis of simulation studies, adverse hydrological events occurring less than
once in 20 years would not have to be met, i.e., the event that energy
requirements could not be met would have a 5% probability of occurring.
Subsequent to assessing the least-cost development program, the latter is
simulated and the probabilities calculated that demand requirements could not
be met. Adjustments are then made in plant timing to ensure that capacity
deficits have a probability of less than 5% of occurring (in the present
study these adjustments are negligibly small; one thermal plant has to
be advanced by one month in 1982 and two respectively 1 and 3 months in 1988
and 1990). The simulation also provides operational costs and fuel costs for
the various alternatives.
6.05      Five alternatives were eliminated for not meeting the probability
constraint and, for the remaining 10 alternatives, the present values of the
cost streams were calculated (all at constant 1976 prices), using a discount
rate of 11%, representing the estimated opportunity cost of capital in Colombia.
System effects beyond the end of the discount period (1991) were accounted
for by making corrections for differences in capacities and related costs,
calculating present values of steam plants to be replaced after 25 years,
valuing differences in generation (thermal and hydro) at their respective
long-term marginal cost, and calculating present values of continuing differ-
ences in operational cost and fuel. A sensitivity analysis was made with
respect to the discount rate (10%, 12%) and the assumed economic fuel prices
($20/t for coal, $13/bbl for residual oil and $1.40/1000 ft3 for gas, increas-
ing by 10% and 20%). The economic ranking of the lowest and next lowest
ranking alternatives does not change as a result of this analysis. The third
and fourth lowest ranking alternatives would change place in merit order if a
discount rate of 12% is assumed.
6.06      The analysis also shows that the results are insensitive to a
reasonable range in variation of the standard conversion factor (corres-
ponding to the shadow exchange rate). The results are also insensitive to
the use of conversion factors, i.e. neither the timing of individual plants
within a development scheme nor the ranking of alternative development schemes
are affected whether or not conversion factors are applied.

6.07      The ranking of future plants in the least-cost alternative develop-
ment generation program (including transmission lines related to each item in
the program) compared with the present plan (4.01) is the following:
----------Least Cost Plan--------
MW               1977                  1978
Tasajero                          132            December 1982             1985

Patia                           1,200            July 1989                   -
San Juan                        1,500            December 1990               -
The advancement of Tasajero and Cerrejon II, both coal fired thermal plants,
is required because of delays in plant completion and security of supply.
Guadalupe IV and Playas, both hydro, should follow these 2 plants because the
larger hydro plants, Betania and Guavio, cannot be completed earlier than
indicated. The most important changes with respect to the present program
are the advancement of the thermal expansion at Tasajero (ICEL) and Cerrejon
II (CORELCA). ISA's Board is expected to approve a revised program of future
generating plant substantially in accordance with the above and ICEL and
CORELCA would take the necessary steps to execute their respective part of
the program in accordance with the scheduled as agreed to by the Board.
6.08      The comparison as originally prepared by ISA did not include
the replacement of EPM's Guadalupe I hydro plant with a capacity of 100 MW and
the Troneras hydro addition of 26 MW. The diversion of 3 rivers to the
Guadalupe reservoir, however, were included and justified. Simulation,
including these plants indicate that for capacity reasons they are not
required. Because generation would be increased only marginally, it appears
that neither the renovation of Guadalupe I, nor the addition of a second unit
at Troneras have substantial economic merits and could be deleted from the
future program.
6.09      The present program also includes CVC's multipurpose Salvajina hydro
project, the construction of which would be subject to Bank review under the
San Carlos I agreements. In ISA's report, all but one alternative development
plan include Salvajina (180 MW). The one excluding Salvajina has been con-
ceived on the basis of the least-cost development program by adjusting the
timing of plants in the least-cost program to meet power requirements. This
changes the ranking of the least-cost scheme from 1 to 9, which shows that
Salvajina forms part of the least-cost development program.
6.10      The net present value differences of the 10 alternatives are the
following:

Return on Investment
6.11      The return on investment is the discount rate which equates the
present value of the cost and benefits streams associated with a project over
the economic life of the project. Because San Carlos I, II, Calderas and
Jaguas would now be constructed concurrently, they cannot be considered in
isolation (6.01) and the calculations were made on the combination of these
plants (Annex 6.1). The cost streams comprise capital cost, including the
1980-1986 distribution expansion commensurate with these projects, and
operating and maintenance cost related to these works. These costs were
converted to border prices, based on conversion factors for individual cost
components. As a proxy for benefits, the estimated average 1978 revenue for
the Central and Atlantic Regions of USJ2/kWh (1.27), multiplied by the
standard conversion factor (0.92), was used taking into account total average
generation and deducting losses.
6.12      The resulting rate of return of 13.5% is higher than the 7.5%
calculated for the San Carlos I project, due to:
(a) for the San Carlos I projects, the rate of return was
calculated for this project alone (7.5%) and in combination
with the 500-kV interconnection project (13%);
(b) reduction in project estimated cost (4.06);
(c) the substantial average increase in rates (some 50% in
real terms since 1977);
(d)  the improved efficiency of the system due to the
construction of San Carlos II, Jaguas and Calderas;
(e)  the use of the standard conversion factor (for San Carlos I
the average consumption conversion factor of 0.785 was used).
6.13      A sensitivity analysis was carried out to measure the impact of
major uncertainties underlying the return calculation. Sensitivity to changes
in operational cost is negligibly small, i.e. the rate of return would only



- 48 -
depend on possible variations in capital cost and revenues (rates and/or
sales). With respect to capital cost, the possibility that ISA's shareholders
will have to step-up their investments in distribution (1.21) compared with
its present 25% of total investments, appears probable and the sensitivity to
an increased program should be investigated. The analysis shows the following:
Assumptions                                         Rate of Return (%)
Basic                                                                 13.5
10% increase in revenue                                              14.6
10% increase in capital cost                                         12.4
100% increase in distribution expansion                              11.5
10% increase in capital cost and 10% reduction
in revenues                                                        11.1
100% increase in distribution expansion and 10%
increase in capital cost and 10% reduction
in revenues                                                         9.5
Because even assuming that cost would increase by 10%, revenues decrease
by 10% and that investments in distribution related to the project would
double, the rate of return would barely drop below 10%, the probability
appears high that the rate of return on the project exceeds the opportunity
cost of capital (assumed to be 11%) by a comfortable margin.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations the following agreements were reached:
(a) The Government undertaking in the San Carlos I agreements
(Loan 1582-CO) that it will meet ICEL and CORELCA's financial
commitments to ISA in a timely fashion, has been modified to
include payments for the purchase of power (2.17);
(b) ISA would engage Consultants by December 31, 1979 for carrying
out a study of the requirements for coordinated dispatch,
including training, under conditions and terms acceptable to the
Bank; the study would be completed by December 31, 1981 (4.16);
(c) ISA would engage consultants by December 31, 1979 for carry-
ing out a study assessing ISA's manpower requirements and
training, under conditions and terms acceptable to the Bank.
The study would be completed by June 30, 1980. An agreed
training program would be instituted for completion by
June 30, 1983 (4.18);
(d) ISA would execute the Project in accordance with an agreed
implementation schedule (4.21);



- 49 -
(e) ISA would acquire all lands and rights in respect of land and
make arrangements for the evacuation to be completed, by
December 31, 1980, for any area required for the works of the
Calderas hydro plant and, by December 31, 1981, all other lands
and rights in respect of lands required for the carrying out of
the project (4.25);
(f) The covenants related to two sets of ISA's rate of returns in
the San Carlos I agreements have been modified to reflect a
common rate of return on all of ISA's assets including the
500-kV assets, stipulating overall rates of return as agreed to
under San Carlos I for the assets other than 500-kV (5.14);
(g) EPM's present debt service covenant (Loan 874-CO) has been
modified to include contributions to ISA in the calculation of
debt service; from 1979 onward it would meet a debt service
test of 1.5 (5.20);
(h) CVC would not incur any long term debt without Bank concurrence,
unless it would meet (including contributions to ISA) a debt
service test of 1.2 in 1980, 1.3 in 1981-83 and 1.5 thereafter
(5.21);
(i) CORELCA's undertaking under San Carlos I (Loan 1502-CO) that
it will carry out an overall organizational study of its
institution has been amended to include the finances of its
3 largest subsidiaries (5.23);
(j) ISA and its shareholders agreed to a set of indicators to
be used for monitoring performance during project execution
(5.26); and
(k) ISA and its shareholders would carry out a study on the possible
creation of a common system of accounts. The terms of reference
would be furnished to the Government and the Bank for review
and comments by December 31, 1979 and the study would be
completed by June 30, 1981 (5.28).
7.02      Effectiveness of the proposed loan would be subject to:  Receipt of
evidence that ISA has made satisfactory arrangements for the balance of
foreign exchange requirements for the project and for the financing of the
Jaguas plant (5.08).
7.03      With the above assurances the project would be suitable for a Bank
loan of MUS$72 equivalent to be made to ISA with the guarantee of the Govern-
ment of Colombia. The loan would have a repayment period of 17 years including
a grace period of 4 years.

SAN CARLOS I HYDRO POWER AND 500-kV INTERCONNECTION PROJECTS
DESCRIPTION OF ISA'S SHAREHOLDERS
Empresa de Energia Electrica de Bogota
1.        EEEB is an autonomous company, owned by the Municipality of the
Special District of Bogota, which generates, transmits and distributes
electricity. It serves some 483,000 consumers in metropolitan Bogota
directly and sells power in bulk to ICEL's subsidiary in the department of
Cundinamarca. EEEB has received four loans from the Bank, three of which,
(totalling MUS$ 85.6) have been fully disbursed. The fourth (MUS$84) was
made in 1978 for the Mesitas project. A Project Performance Audit 1/ on the
most recent loan (537-CO of August 2, 1968) concluded that EEEB was a
well-managed utility, and that the project was successfully executed.
2.        EEEB is administered by a seven member Board of Directors and a
General Manager. The Mayor of Bogota, or his representative, serves as
the Chairman of the Board of Directors. The General Manager, who is
responsible for the day-to-day management of the company, is appointed by
the Board subject to the Mayor's approval. EEEB's management is adequate
for the execution of its expansion program and for the operation of its
facilities.
3.        EEEB has an installed capacity of 719 MW, 583 MW from hydro
and 136 MW from thermal power stations. The Mesitas project is scheduled
to come into operation by mid-1982. A distribution project covering the
city and valley of Bogota is being considered for possible Bank financing.
Empresas Publicas de Medellin
4.        EPM is an autonomous company, owned by the Municipality of
Medellin, which provides power, water, sewerage, and telephone services
for the city of Medellin and vicinity. It serves some 255,000 power
consumers in metropolitan Medellin and sells in bulk to ICEL's subsidiary
in the department of Antioquia. EPM has received four loans from the
Bank totalling MUS$ 129. A Project Performance Audit 2/ on the third
project (Loan 369-CO of February 7, 1964) concluded that the project was
1/   Project Performance Audit Report on Colombia:  Third Power Expansion
Program (Sec M77-536 of June 29, 1977).
2/   Performance Audit on Colombia:  Third Medellin Power Project (Sec
M74-376 of May 24, 1974).

worthwhile and that, with the exception of the distribution component, it
was well executed. The most recent project financed by the Bank (Guatape II,
Loan 874-CO) is currently under construction and is scheduled for completion
by the first quarter of 1979, 20 months behind schedule. During construction,
difficulties have been encountered in relocating the population of El Penol,
which has been flooded by the Santa Rita reservoir, mainly because of poor
planning and excessive demands for compensation.
5.        EPM is managed by a seven member Board of Directors and the General
Manager. The Mayor of Medellin, or his representative, is the Chairman of
the Board of Directors. After some difficulties in the mid-1970s resulting
from political interference in EPM by the municipal government, EPM's
management is now generally adequate and the improvements recently made have
increased its capacity to execute its expansion program and to operate its
facilities.
6.        The various services of EPM are managed as separate entities with
separate accounting systems. Including Guatape II, EPM has an installed
capacity of 4,014 MW (all hydro). In addition to this project, EPM's
investment program for 1977-84 includes expansion in generation, transmission,
and distribution facilities, as well as the initial expenditures for the new
Guadalupe IV (260 MW) hydro station.
Corporacion Autonoma Regional del Cauca
7.        CVC is an autonomous multipurpose State corporation under the
National Planning Department, responsible for developing the Cauca Valley.
One of its main activities is generating and transmitting power in the
Valley, undertaken in part through CHIDRAL, which is owned by CVC (65%),
the Municipality of Cali (17%) and Empresas Municipales de Cali (EMCALI--18%).
CVC-CHIDRAL sells power in bulk to EMCALI and other distributing companies
(subsidiaries of ICEL and CVC) serving a total of some 298,000 consumers.
8.        CVC-CHIDRAL has received five loans from the Bank totalling
MUS$ 44.6 (the last of which was made in 1963) which have been fully
disbursed. CVC-CHIDRAL has an installed capacity of 598 MW (540 MW
hydro, 58 MW thermal). The CVC-CHIDRAL expansion program includes the
execution of the multipurpose Salvajina project (intended mainly for flood
control and irrigation), which includes 180 MW of generating capacity, and
the corresponding transmission facilities.
9.        CVC is administered by a seven member Board of Directors and an
Executive Director appointed by the President of the Republic. CVC's
various activities 1/ are managed as separate enterprises with relatively
1/   These activties, in addition to power generation and transmission,
include rural electrification (carried out through the local sub-
sidiaries); irrigation and rural development; development of natural
resources (including operation of a captive coal mine for thermal
power generation); and operation of hotels.

independent accounting systems. Some of CVC's generation and transmission
facilities are leased to and operated by CHIDRAL. CHIDRAL is administered by
a seven member Board of Directors and a General Manager. EMCALI is respon-
sible for power distribution in the city of Cali and vicinity. It is a
municipal company which also provides water, sewerage and telephone services.
10.       CVC and EMCALI are considering setting up a new regional power
company to take charge of power generation and transmission in the Cauca
Valley. They have expressed their intention of consulting their creditors
(among which the Bank is included because of its early power loans to CVC and
CHIDRAL and its more recent loans for water supply: 682-CO and 1523-CO in
1970 and 1978 respectively) on this proposal.
Corporacion Electrica de la Costa Atlantica
11.       CORELCA is an autonomous corporation in operation since 1972.  It is
responsible for power generation and transmission in seven departments on the
Atlantic Coast. The seven distributing companies in the area are subsidiaries
of CORELCA and buy power in bulk from it. Together they have an installed
capacity of 440 MW (all thermal) and serve about 322,000 consumers. One of
CORELCA's subsidiaries, ELECTRIBOL, which at the time was a subsidiary of
ICEL, received a MUS$ 5 Bank loan (347-CO) in 1963, which is fully disbursed.
CORELCA is in the process of completing a 132-MW steam station. Through
1980-81, its investment program comprises 132 MW of gas-fired steam plant in
the Barranquilla and another of 66 MW in Cartagena, and the expansion of its
transmission system. A 150 MW steam station that is to use coal from the
Cerrejon project is planned for commissioning in 1983. CORELCA became an
ISA shareholder in 1978 and thus will participate in ISA's generation and
transmission projects.
12.       CORELCA is administered by a seven member Board of Directors and
a Managing Director. Its organization, budgeting, budget control, admini-
stration and accounting require strengthening to enable it to keep pace with
its rapid growth. Under the San Carlos I loan, CORELCA agreed, to this end,
to carry out, a study under terms of reference discussed with the Bank.
CORELCA has agreed under the proposed loan for San Carlos II to extend the
study to its 3 main subsidiaries and to a revised program for executing the
study (see para. 2.18).
Instituto Colombiano de Energia Electrica
13.       ICEL is a government institute, responsible to the Ministry of
Mines and Energy, and provides electric power services for the rest of
the country through 11 subsidiary companies in which it is the majority
shareholder (the other shareholders are the respective local governments).

Annex 2.2
Page 4 of 4
ICEL's subsidiaries have an installed capacity of 543 MW (340 MW hydro,
203 MW thermal) and serve about 580,000 customers. ICEL's role was
intitially conceived as that of coordinator of the power sector development.
It was not, however, successful in this function and its mission presently
consists largely of supervising the extension of service to smaller towns
and rural areas. In keeping with Government policy, ICEL will concentrate
its activities in areas not served by other entities, which are expected to
be largely rural; the Government would continue to provide budgetary support
for these electric power services through ICEL. ICEL is also responsible
for the investment program of most of its subsidiaries, which essentially
comprises expansion of the various transmission and distribution systems
connected to the interconnected system, and generating additions to isolated
systems. The projects executed by ICEL are transferred to its subsidiaries
in the form of capital contribution. Three 1/ of ICEL's subsidiaries have
received four loans from the Bank, totalling MUS$ 14.6, which have been
fully disbursed. ICEL is the executing agency for the rural electrification
component (US$2.1) of Loan 1352-CO, which is proceeding well after some
initial delays.
14.       ICEL is administered by a five member Board of Directors (chaired
by the Minister of Mines and Energy) and by a General Manager appointed by
the President of the Republic. ICEL and its subsidiaries have organizational
and administrative shortcomings, resulting from frequent changes in middle
management, low salaries, lack of qualified staff, poor accounting systems
and insufficient control exercised by ICEL over the operations of its
subsidiaries. To formulate an improvement program, ICEL undertook under
the San Carlos I loan to conduct a study of at least five of its larger
subsidiaries. The study would be presented to the Bank, together with ICEL's
proposals for implementation by December 31, 1979 during negotiation for San
Carlos II, this date was amended to March 31, 1980. Implementation of the
proposals (as amended resulting from comments of the Bank), would be completed
by December 31, 1981.
1/   Central Hidroelectrica de Caldas (CHEC) (39-CO and 217-CO), Central
Hidroelectrica del Rio Lebrija (54-CO), now known as Electrificadora
de Santander, and Electrificadora de Bolivar (347-CO), now a sub-
sidiary of CORELCA.
