INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF UPPER VOLTA
FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Upper Volta for the equivalent of
US$2.85 million on standard IDA terms to help finance an education project.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
20        The basic problems of economic development in Upper Volta were
setout in a report entitled "The Economic Development of Upper Volta',
dated November 27, 1970  (R70-237 and R71-2). An updating memorandum of
January 13, 1972, was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 2, 1972
(R72-47). Annex I contains country data, including data on foreign aid.
Background
3.        Upper Volta has been classified by the United Nations as one of
the 25 "least developed countries" in the world. It suffers from a number
of serious growth constraints: a landlocked situation, limited domestic
markets and marketing facilities, poor soil, lack of water and natural
resources, endemic diseases, uneven population distribution and a low level
of education and technical ability, particularly in the rural areas.
Moreover, the country's poverty is characterized by an insufficient nutri-
tion level (animal protein intake is only half that of neighbouring Mali
and Niger).
4.       Upper Volta's economy is and will remain for some time almost
entirely dependent on agriculture and livestock. Together these two
sectors account directly for over one third of GDP and make the economy
particularly vulnerable to adverse weather conditions. A further 10 percent
of GDP comes from the manufacturing sector which is closely linked to agri-
culture. A succession of droughts in the past few years has caused a severe
setback in agricultural (cotton, food crops, and livestock) production,
with consequent adverse effects on exports, and has contributed largely
to the stagnation of the econony. With population growing at the rate of
about 2 percent a year, real GDP per capita has revuai.ned virtually un-
changed since the early 1960's.



_2-
Last year's drought, the most serious so far in the past few
yeas, has aggravalted an already critical situation. Food production
drop4ped 8 percent compared with 1971 and half the country's natural
'last" s were destroyeed  It is feared that the loss of cattle may
eXCeed l9691s catastrophic level when about 100,000 animals died.
Because of the limited economic opportunities at home, parti-
czIi;xlarl in rural areas, young people frequently choose to migrate more
or less permaxtently to coastal countries, where wages are much higher
than in Upper Volta, It is estimated that over half-a-million Voltaics
have migrated to neighbouring countries, the majority being i, the Ivory
Coast. Although, their contribution to Upper Voltats balance of pay-
ip=_ts in the form. of forei,n exchange remittances is substantial, the
rurl&L ecaonrmy of -the country is thus drained of its most dynamic elements.
Public Fi.nxece
Econvouic development had been further hazpered by poor mana-
gaemnt of public finances during the first years of independence (1960-
66) and since then by strict controls over public expendituires. In1 the early
1960's expenditurzes outran revenues to the extent thatt by the end of 1965 the
Govewrment was heavily in debt an short-term account and could no longer
pay the salariee of its employees. The rdlitary Governmt. which as-
sumed power i. 1966 gave first priority to adoption and implementation
of a stabilization program aimed at reducing outstanding debts and at
bringing public expenditures and income into better balance. As a result
t-he uoverm.rit has been able to repa:y all its short-term debt and has
accundated re'latfrvely large liquid reserVes and foreign assets (at the
end of' 1972 official. foreign exchange reserves were equivalent to about
7 monthst imorts), However, this has been achieved at the cost of cut-
ting back development expenditures, and a number olf projects largely
financed by external assistance have been held up for want of local
counterpart funds.
3         Foreign sources have supplied more than two-thirds of total
investment- expenditures effected under the first Development Plan (1967-
7O). The principal sources of aid have been tne "Fonds d'Aide et de
Cooperation" (FAC) of France and the "Fonda Euarop6en de D6veloppement"
(FE) of the 3uropean Economic Community, These two agencies together
have so far provided about 80 percent of all foreign aid to Upper Volta
(Annex i)   About half of their aid has been in the fom of grants.
About half of it was capital aid and one fourth technical assistance,
A substantial part of French grants (a third in 1972) was for assistance
to the public administration; the rest was distributed (in 1972, almost
equally)I bletwee.n agriculture, road maintenance, education, and telecom-
i*inLeications. IM2s contributions were primarily for water supply (urban
-s well as rural) anrid roads, For the 1967-69 period the average



- 3 -
concessionary element for aid commitments was about 95 percent. This
reflects the conviction of aid donors that Upper Volta needs the softest
possible terms in foreign assistance.
9.        In addition to this development aid, the international com-
munity is currently undertaking special action to assist Upper Volta as
one of the six sahelian countries affected by last year's drought (Chad,
Mali, Mauretania, Niger, Senegal and Upper Volta).  The FAO has announced
an  emergency program with which the World Food Prograxne and UNDP are
also associated. Under the program 50,000 tons of food grain have
already been allocated to these countries. This amounts to 77 percent
of the WFP emergency resources for the current year. A task force is
being sent to the area to ward off potential human starvation and to
build a nucleus of generating stock for future herds. Helicopters will
be used to transport grain. A further 32,000 tons of food are being
supplied by FED, and other bilateral aid donors are also contributing.
Prospects
10.       The second five-year Development Plan (1972-76) was approved
in June 1972. Like the previous plan it is essentially a list of pro-
jects to be presented to foreign aid donors for financing. Proposed
total investments amount to an average of about bS$40 million per year.
A minimum per capita GDP growth of 3 percent per year in current prices
is envisaged. The plan also gives increased attention to the problem
of planning recurrent costs and the necessity of a closer cooperation
than in the past between the Ministries of Finance and Planning.
11.        On the basis of the past correlation in Upper Volta between the
rate of growth and investments it seems that the planned investment level
would be too low to achieve the growth target.  However, it is doubtful
whether an increase in the planned investment target would be compatible with
Upper Volta's absorptive capacity or with the availability of domestic
and external resources. The Government is hoping to interest foreign
investors in the exploitation of the country's mineral deposits, parti-
cularly the manganese deposit near Tambao, but there is considerable
doubt about the economic feasibility of such investments in view of the
heavy transport costs involved. On the other hand, agriculture should
benefit substantially from the international campaign for the eradication
of riverblindmess,  planned to start in 1974. Large areas currently
made uninhabitable by the disease are likely to be resettled, and in
view of the scarcity of good agricultural land, development of these
areas should yield high returns.
12.       Foreign aid will continue to play a decisive role in the
development of Upper Volta, but if this aid is to be truly effective,
there will be need for better coordination within the Government and for



some relaxation of present budgetary controls over development expenditures,
possibly linked with additional revenue measures to cover the increase
in recurrent costs.  An economic mission organized by the UNDP visited
Upper Volta towards the end of 1972, and a follow-up mission from the
Bank is tentatively planned for late 1973 to continue the identification
of projects suitable for external financing, together with related tech-
nical assistance requirements.
_130      In view of the prospective resource gap, the level of poverty
of the country and its limited growth potential, foreign aid should
continue on concessionary terms. External debt service at present absorbs
about 7 percent of Upper Volta's export earnings, and although this figure
is fairly low in absolute terms, it is high in relation to the country's very
limited creditworthiness.  Equally, Upper Volta cannot be expected to
make any large contributions to the financing of public investment, and
external;lending agencies must continue to finance a high proportion of
local costs if development projects are to move forward.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
14.       To date the Bank Group's contribution to Upper Volta's develop-
ment consists of four projects (Annex II). The telecomnmications project,
for which an $0.8 million IDA credit was made in 1969, was initially
delayed by difficulties in recruiting expatriate experts, but is now
proceeding satisfactorily.  The West Volta cotton project, for which a
a $6.2 million IDA credit was made in 1970, is also proceeding satisfacto-
rily, although drought conditions have kept production so far below expec-
tations. The other two projects are only just starting: one is a road
project (42.8 million) and the-other a rural development fund ($2.2
million) for both of which IDA credits were approved in FY1972.   So far
indications are that they are proceeding satisfactorily.
15.       The Bank Group's strategy in Upper Volta is dictated by the
extreme poverty of the country and the need to raise productivity in
agriculture and animal husbandry on which the bulk of the population depend
for a livelihood. A certain minimal infrastructure is required for the
operation of the econony, and the IDA projects for telecommunications, and
a possible future road project, are designed to help in providing this.
For the rest, IDA lending is directed principally to the rural sector for
projects in agriculture, education and village improvements. The campaign
for the control of riverblindness in the Volta River basin should open
up new opportunities for investment in land settlement and agricultural
development, and the Bank Group will be ready to consider assisting in the
preparation and financing of projects in this field when they are identified.
160       A second telecommunications project is being submitted to the
Executive Directors for their consideration concurrently with the proposed



education project. This would help finance a major part of Upper Volta's
197h-1977 telecommunications development program.  The project consists
mainly of improvement and expansion of local telephone lines and switching
facilities, provision of microwave links for national and international
communications, training of personnel and consultants' services. The project
would particularly improve telecommunications services between the rural
areas and the principal regional centers.
17.        A number of other projects are also under consideration for IDA
financing.  A second cotton project is currently being appraised and is
scheduled for presentation to the Executive Directors in FY7h4 The feasi-
bility of a livestock project and a rice project is being reviewed, and
road studies now being carried out with financing from credit 316-UV are
expected to lead to a second road project in due course.
18.       The Bank Group is also considering active participation in the
international agsistance program aimed at alleviating the effects of the
current drough in the affected sahelian countries,including Upper Volta.
A mission is currently in the field discussing such participation, and pro-
posals for IDA assistance will be formulated in the coming weeks.
19.        Upper Volta nevertheless remains one of the countries in which
external assistance is limdted at present more by shortage of projects than
by shortage of external fund B. The Bank Group has been a relatively small
lender to date by comparison with the FAC and the FED, and it is not proving
easy to raise substantially the level of IDA assistance.   There is an acute
scarcity of trained people in the country, and the administration is not
geared to a high level of public spending.
PART III: THE EDUCATION SECTOR
20.        Upper Volta has both a formal educational system and a much smaller
system of non-formal rural training. The formal system closely follows the
French pattern; it emphasizes general knowledge as a preparation to higher
studies, and is geared primarily towards the need of the civil service for
clerical and administrative workers rather than towards supplying agricul-
ture, industry and public services with managers, technicians and skilled
workers. Besides being ill-adapted to the economic needs of the country the
formal system is also very costly. Primary school teacher salaries are, for
instance, up to 30 times per capita GDP. At this cost, formal education will
always be the privilege of a minority.
21.        Under the present Government, education has enjoyed high priority.
While the GovernmentTs operating budget has been expanding by 5 percent a
year current expenditures for education have been growing by 10 percent a
year, and those for primary education by 17 percent, so that education's share
increased from about 18 percent in 1964 to about 28 percent in 1972. At the
same time the percentage of enrollment of school-age children has only rea-
ched about 10 percent in primary and 2 percent in secondary education. More-
over, class repeating and drop-out rates remained very high, with 18 percent



- 6 -
of those who enter the primary cycle actually graduating from it.
Therefore, to educate more of its people and fit them for relevant
economiic occupations, Upper Volta will have to turn to a less expensive
syry texi of education better adapted to the country's needs.
22.       Recognizing this need Upper Volta soon after independence es-
tablished a non-formal village education system parallel to the expansion
of its formal system and built around a network of Centres d'Education
.Rurale (CERs). The primary aim of the CERs is to provide rural
youth, hitherto mostly illiterate, with a minimum of practical
eduLcation so as to assist them in becoming more productive farmers.
;YThe period of sducation in the CERs is 3 years, equally divided between
practical training on the CERst own fields and acquiring a basic general
education,
23.       This system is less costly. The salary of a rural education
teacher is abou-t one third that of a primary school teacher, and the
cost of a pupil in a CER is about CFAF 5,000 a year as coiWpared with
CFA.TT 12,000 in orimary school,  Also the drop-out rate is low and the
school relates closely to village life; productivity per worker on the
CERs con;pares favorably with that of the average traditional farmer.
Nevertheless3 and despite this partial success, the CFRs have fallen
short of their goals0 The use of French, which is a foreign language
for the raral conunmities, as the medium of instruction makes learning
co'nsiderablv maore difficult. Recruitment of teachers is based more on
academic achievements  than on ability to teach agriculture.  Pupils
have been gradually admitted at a younger age, which has tended to make
rural edducation a less desirable system parallel to formal education and
to reduce the likelihood that youngsters will thereafter settle in the
irual areas.
24.       The Government has recently come to recognize the necessity
for a major reform of the whole education system* The growth of the
formal system will be reduced.  At the same timle, with UNESCdOtICEF
asslstance, -;he Government will review both structure and content of
primary education, and will give to non-formal education (i.e., at this
stage, rural education) a higher priority than has been so far the case.
Tn secondary education more emphasis will be given to practical subjects
including the teaching of science, as a basis for further training at
technical and professional levels.
25.       The Government intends to raise the entrance ame for CERs to 15
years for boys and 13 for girls, to experiment with teaching in the national
languages, to make the curriculum more practical and better related to
,re needs of rural communities and to strengthen the proficiency and interest



- 7 -
of the teachers in practical matters relating to rural life. Moreover,
the rural education system will be more closely coordinated with rural
development services, both at the national and at the regional level.   The
Government has already undertaken action to place by May 1, 1974 the Direct-
orate of Rural Education and the Directorate of Rural Development under the
Ministry of Agriculture, which will be responsible for all aspects of rural
development; and the Regional Development Offices (ORDs) will provide
coordination between the extension services and rural education.
26.       Rural schooling will in future lead directly to rural employment
or to further training opportunities designed to bridge the interval
between adolescence and adulthood. This will be done in two ways. First,
there will be the post-school cooperatives (GPS) grouping ex-CER students
into small cooperatives, assisted financially and professionally by the
Regional Development Offices (ORDs). Second, there will be a small number
of centers which would enable selected leavers to have access to further
training as rural teachers or other rural development agents.
27.       Higher education in Upper Volta is still at a very early stage
of its development. In view of the limited number of disciplines offered
enrollment is low and cost per student is very high. The Institute of
Higher Education (CESUP), created in 1969 as a nucleus of a future uni-
versity, prepares students for a diploma in literary studies* Together
with two affiliated institutes, the University Institute of Teaching
Technology (IUTP) and the Institute of Technology, Management and Ac*nin-
istration of Firms, there was in 1970 a total enrollment of abou-t 120
Voltaic students, During the same year about 600 further students were
being educated abroad, mainly in France and in Abidjan.
28.       The modernization of education in Upper Volta will be a slow
process, and there are many obstacles to be overcome before the country
can be equipped with an efficient educational system adapted to the re-
quirements of economic development. However, the changes now proposed
are a move in the right direction and justify the full support of the
Bank Group.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
29.       The proposed project draws from various studies of Upper Volta's
rural education system (FAC 1965, UNESCO 1968, FiDES 1969, FED 1970 and
1972, IBRD Report No. AW-19a, Volume IV, November 1970).   Two IDA recon-
naissance missions visited the country in June/July 1971 and February
1972, and the project was appraised in May 1972.



rormal Fducation,
30.       In the formal education sector, the project would strengthen
the standards for science education by assisting 21 public secondary
schools which require practical facilities, More effective science
teaching iS expected to benefit 6,150 secondary students and particularly
950 students enrolled in science streams.
%iral Education
39.       In the non-formal sector, the project would help the Government
improve raral education in the ORD's of Dedougou, Koudougou and Kaya by:
(') pro-diding for reconstruction and equipment of 40 CERs and for
equipment of 80 other CERs out of abcut 350 now in operation;
(ii)  creating and equipping about 350 post-school cooperative
groutps of 15 CER leavers each;
(iii)  constructing and equipping 3 Rural Development Training
Centers (CPR) for further training of 60 CER graduates in
each center towards mzallng them rural development agerts;
(iv) providing necessary technical assistance for the success
of the project including an evaluation of the rural education
program; and
(v) studying the feasibility of an appropriate system to train
managers for rural development projects.
The project would be coordinated with, and complement* FED assistance for
rural education of June 1972 (grant of $2.3 million) and the IDA credit
for a rural development fumd, which was approved last,year.
32.       Prior to negotiations about 30 CERs had already been identified
by the Government according to criteria acceptable to the Association.  A
further 90 would be selected out of the remaining CERs. Criteria for eli-
gibility for assistance under the Credit include the enrollment of a suffi-
cient number of students at least 15 years old (for boys), 13 years old (for
girls), operation for at least 5 years and the development of a variety of
crops and raising of small animals on an adequate plot of land.  Each center
would develop at least four hectares of land with equip*ent provided under
-iLhe project, under supervision of rural education supervisors attached to
the ORDs. In at least 15 of the CERs teaching would be given in national
languages on an experimental basis. A revision of the curriculum, entrance
requirements and teacher qualifications would be undertaken and completed
by May 1, 1975 i.e. by the time the first group of CERs benefiting from the
project will be opened.
33.       Since 1963 about 15,000 young people have gone through the CERs
fin the project area, and 20,000 are expected to complete their training
between 197h and 1977. It is estimated that these numbers will provide



-9-
the potential for organizing about 800 GPS of 15 young men or women each
having reached at least 18 years of age for men and 16 for women. The pro-
posed project would assist in the establishment of a pilot phase of 150
GPSs. The groups are expected not only to provide their members with in-
creased earnings and better nutrition, but also to reintegrate them into
village life and help them in their role as propagators of improved techni-
ques and practices. The groups to be organized under the project would
be selected on the basis of annual surveys. Selection methods and criteria
have been agreed between the Government and the Association. Each GPS
would have a farm of at least 6 hectares and would receive credit, market-
ing and extension services, to be financed under the proposed credit.
3l.       The 3 CPRs would provide two years of general education and
agricultural training for graduates from the CERs. They would enable
students to enter the rural education teacher training institutes, the
agricultural schools and rural development services, and would provide
basic training in management and agriculture for volunteer group leaders
within the GPS.
35.       Technical assistance of about 16 man-years for the rural education
items would include one rural development specialist in each of the three
ORDs, with experience in cooperatives, credit and training, and a principal
technical adviser to assist the Directorate of Rural Education. It would
also include short-term specialists to assist in the initial survey and
evaluation of the CERs and GPSs and to assess progress of the project and
its final impact on rural communities. Two further man-years of the ser-
vices of an equipment procurement specialist would be needed to help admin-
ister the project. Foreign specialists would, where appropriate, train
local counterparts.
36.       A further component of the rural aspects of the project will
be a feasibility study of a scheme for the training of project managers
and executive personnel for rural development; this is estimated to require
about 15 man-months. An initial study carried out by a French consulting
firm has recommended that such training should be given on the job with
the trainees assuming responsibility for the management of actual projects.
Implementation and Management
37.       The project will be implemented over a period of five years.   It
will be administered by a project unit to be created within the Ministry
of Agriculture and headed by the Director of Rural Education assisted by a
project manager. The project manager will be assisted by the directors of
the project's ORDs, together with the three rural development specialists
attached to them, and by an equipment procurement specialist. The project
director will be responsible for all aspects of project implementation and
will coordinate these aspects within the Government as well as with the
Association. The three directors of the project's ORDs are currently not
responsible for rural education in the areas under the jurisdiction of their
ORDs. Assignment of this responsibility to them with regard to the proposed



- 10 -
project, the creation of the project unit as well as the appointment of
a suitab-e project manager, are conditions of effectiveness of the proposed
credit.
38G       Most sites for the project institutions have already been acquired.
Land for foarming activities will be provided by the local communities con-
cerned. Design and supervision of construction will be carried out by the
Ministry of' Public works.

foLlows:

41.       The proposed IDA credit of $2.85 million would be made to Upper
Volta on standard terms. The credit would finance the foreign exchange costs
of the project plus 40 percent of local costs, or an aggregate of 90 percent
of total project costs net of taxes. The credit would also finance retro-
actively up to $10,000 for expenditures incurred in connection with the
survey undertaken by the Government for the selection of project CERs.



Procurement and Disbursement
42.       The dispersion of the project schools and the small amount of
construction work on each site make it unlikely that firms not already
operating in Upper Volta or in neighboring countries would be interested
in bidding for the contracts. Therefore civil works contracts would
be advertised locaU y with copy to the local embassies of neighboring
countries. For furniture and equipment, local manufacturers would be
given a preferential margin of 15 percent of the c.i.f. cost of competing
imports or the rn'te of import duties, whichever is less; this preference
would also apply to members of the West African Economic Community. Small
agricultural equipment for the rural education centers would be procured
by the project unit after calling for quotations from local suppliers.
43.       The credit would be disbursed against 100 percent of total
expenditures for fur-iture, cattle and equipment, 100 percent of foreign
expenditures or 80 percent of local expenditures for consultant services,
80 percent of total expenditures for the operating costs of the project
unit and 73 percent of total expenditures for civil works. The credit
is expected to be fully disbursed by June 30, 1979.
PART V: LE3AL INSTNM    TS AND AUTHORITY
44.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Upper Volta and the Association, the Recommendation of the Gommittee
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of
the Association and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed
credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The
draft Development Credit Agreement conforms generally to the pattern of
credit agreement for education projects.
45.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would camply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI: RECONMEDATION
46.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION Y
Cr. No. 141-UV Telecommunications Project; US$0.8 million Credit of
February 1T, 1969; Closing Date June 30, 1973.
The project was intended to finance urgently required rehabi-
litation and expansion works for local distribution networks in Ouagadougou
and Bobo-Dioulasso, the reconditioning of obsolete iron-wire lines in the
provinces and the provision of carrier equipmnnt on trunk lines, After initial
delays, mainly due to difficulties in arranging for key expatriate staff to
advise on the works, this project is now proceeding satisfactorily. Completion
is now expected in November 1973, 22 months behind schedule.
/I  These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors on the progress
OY projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems which are
being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They should be
read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not purport to
present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weakaesses in project execution.

Cr. NOe 225-T.v  West Volta Cotton Pro.ect; US$6.2 million Credit of
De_e_ber 30,    0Closig Date lune 30, 196._
FAC is pro-Tiding a grant of fiurther US$1.7 million for the
project. The project is the final stage of a cotton production development
program in West Upper Volta which originally started with technical assist-
ance from Comagnie Frangaise pour le D6veloppement des Fibres Textiles
(CFDT) and FAC financing in 1963c It consists of both expansion of the
area under cotton cultivation on some 466,00C farms and improvement of fields
through credit and extension services, and provision of better communications
and processing facilities. The project also includes flundB for training of
C dff, detailed engineering of secondary roads and preparation of the Second
(Black Volta) Cotton and Agricultural Development Project.
Although Upper Volta suffered a drought in. 1971 for the
second year in a row, cotton production in the project area increased by
33% in 1971/72 over the pre-project year of 1970 while elsewhere production
decreased by about 10%,  Processing and marketing of' cotton lint and seeds

place in November 1972, The bids were scheduled to be opened on March 1.

evaluation of bids. Regarding (b) above the Government proposed four roads
to be studied, and the Association agreed to only two, from Bobo-Dioulasso
to Hounde and Bobo-Dioulasso to Banfora (a total of about 190 km), these
being the only ones considered likely to show a satisfactory rate of return,

June-26, 1972 Closing Date September 30, _ _96.
The project is designed to alleviate constraints to develop-
ment in rural areas, increase agricultural production, and assist rural acti-
vities in most parts of the country where the Government can provide support-
ing services. Between 300,000 and 450,000 people would benefit from the
project. The Rural Development Fund (RDF) Division has been established within
Banque Nationale de Developpement (BND) to execute the project; it started
operating in September, 1972. BND's performance and project management are
satisfactory. Currently it is preparing its first annual program on the basis
of proposals made by the Offices Regionaux de D6veloppement (ORD). Main
components of this program will be wells and village warehouses. The project
which started slowly mainly due to delays over project prefinancing and staff
appointments is now proceeding satisfactorily. Arrangements are being made
for speedy progress in implementing the various sub-projects. Consideration
is also being given to the financing of drought relief measures under -this
project.
