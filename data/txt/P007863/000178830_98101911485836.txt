SECOND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMIARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a Second Rural Development Project in Paraguay
for which a loan of US$22 million is proposed. The project, in line with the
Government's overall long-term land settlement policy, would be aimed mainly
at helping small farmers in newly developing land colonies along the Parana
River in the Southeastern part of Itapua Department. Besides supplying invest-
ment credit to farmers, the project would also provide supporting services such
as roads, land demarcation and titling, community development and health care.
These components would all be aimed at (a) expanding the area cultivated;
(b) increasing mainly small farmer incomes; (c) improving the physical and
social infrastructure in the project area; and (d) strengthening insti-
tutions such as the National Development Bank (BNF), the National Council
for Social Progress (CNPS), the Mlinistry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG),
and the Institute of Rural Wlelfare (IBR).
ii.       The Bank Group has made 18 loans to Paraguay, including 10 from IBRD
and eight IDA credits amounting to US$103.8 million (US$58.3 million, IBRD;
US$45.5 million, IDA) in support of livestock and rural development (45%),
transport (32%), education (19%) and preinvestment studies (4%). The first
Rural Development Project became effective on April 14, 1975 and is assisting
small farmers in three public settlement colonies located in the Eastern
Region of Paraguay.
iii.      Agriculture is a major sector of the Paraguayan economy 'and
accounted, during 1975, for approximately 35% of GDP, 97% of export value
(including wood and processed products), and 50% of employment. The expansion
of crop, forestry and livestock production during 1969/74 resulted in an agri-
cultural sector growth rate of 6%, compared with only 1.3% during the period
1964-69, mainly as a result of Paraguay's efforts to encourage production of
exportable crops. During the period 1970/75, production of such commodities
increased by an average of 16.6% annually compared with a rate of only 1.4%
p.a. for domestically consumed crops. Out of a total land area of nearly 41
million ha, only about 1 million ha (2%) are used for crop purposes. An
additional 7 million ha could be cultivated, but this land is currently used
for extensive livestock farming or is covered with forest or bush. Aware of
the country's unexploited agricultural potential, the Government is seeking to
expand the area under cultivation through the colonization of virgin lands.
The proposed project is consistent with this strategy.
iv.       More equitable distribution of potentially productive land in Paraguay
has been achieved in recent years through colonization of both Government and
privately owned land. IBR, which deals with all aspects of land reform and



- ii -
settlement, has so far established 250 colonies of over 40,000 families
on unused state lands. This effort has helped ease the pressure on land,
though distribution of land holdings is still uneven. The proposed Second
Rural Development Project fits this general Government strategy for agricul-
tural growth and rural development.
v.        Project cost is estimated at about US$42.8 million, including
physical and price contingencies, with a foreign exchange component of US$24.6
million (57%) and a local cost component of US$18.2 million (43%). The proj-
ect would be financed by: (a) the proposed Bank loan of US$22 million;
(b) a loan of US$2.6 million from the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW);
(c) a Government contribution of US$16.4 million; and (d) subborrowers'
contribution of US$1.8 million. The proposed Bank loan would finance part of
the foreign exchange costs and would be made to the Government at 8.2%. It
would be channelled to participating agencies through the Central Bank (CB).
vi.       CNPS would coordinate the operations of the various institutions
involved in the project both at the national and field levels. It has
appointed a Project Coordinator who would be stationed in Asuncion and be
responsible for overall project coordination and implementation and a Deputy
Coordinator to be stationed in project area B at the main community center and
be responsible for coordination and supervision at the project level. Both
would be acceptable to the Bank. A system of project monitoring and evaluation
would be introduced within CNPS.
vii.      The farm credit component would be managed by BNF, assisted by MAG
technicians. As BNF is in a weak financial position agreement has been reached
on an overall rehabilitation plan, in line with terms and conditions for the
proposed Bank Industrial Credit Project, including government equity contribu-
tion, reduction in operating costs, increase in the average yield on loans,
strengthening of BNF's collection office and improvement of loan recovery.
First phase implementation of the debt recovery plan and the receipt of a
government capital contribution of G 1,300 million are conditions of loan
effectiveness.
viii.     As is usual in agricultural credit projects, farm inputs would be
procured through regular commercial channels. Contracts for the construction
of all-weather roads, MOPC, CNPS, IBR and MAG equipment, and vehicles would be
procured through international competitive bidding. Health and community
facility construction, with furniture and equipment, would be procured on the
basis of local competitive bidding. Civil works for earth roads would be
carried out on force account. The project would be implemented over a three-
year period.
ix.       The overall economic rate of return for the project, including both
sub-project areas A and B, is estimated at 14%. Should yields be lower than
expected, or commodity prices drop to cause a 10% decline in benefits, then
the overall economic rate of return on the project would be 10%. A 10% in-
crease in investment costs would also reduce the project economic rate of
return to 10%.



- iii -
x.        About 12,000 families, including 3,600 credit beneficiaries, would
benefit from the project at full development. Farmers and villagers in area B
would benefit from the availability of better health and extension services,
as well as higher farm gate prices due to transport savings generated by road
construction and improvement. The latter will lead to further development and
settlement of additional areas.
xi.       During negotiations, assurances were obtained which provide a suit-
able basis for a Bank loan of US$22 million for a term of 17 years, including
3.5 years of grace. The loan would be to the Government of Paraguay, which
would bear the foreign exchange risk.

SECOND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Paraguay has requested a Bank loan to help finance
a Second Rural Development Project in the southeastern part of the Department
of Itapua along the Parana River as part of its overall, long-term land settle-
ment policy. The First Rural Development Project is assisting small farmers
in three public settlement colonies located in the Eastern Region of Paraguay.
The Bank Group has so far made 18 loans to Paraguay, including 10 from IBRD
and eight IDA credits, amounting to US$103.8 million (US$58.3 million, IBRD,
US$45.5 million, IDA) in support of livestock and rural development (45%),
transport (32%), education (19%), and preinvestment studies (4%).
1.02      The project was identified by an FAO/CP mission to Paraguay during
September 1975 and subsequently prepared by a second FAO/CP mission during
April/May 1976.  The preparation report was based on data from a detailed
Government survey of the project area between February and April 1976.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Paraguay is an agricultural country with 60% of its 2.6 million popu-
lation living in rural areas. The average family size in the rural area is 6.2
persons, and 65% of the rural population earns less than the poverty income
level, estimated by the Bank at US$188 per capita in 1975, making Paraguay
one of the poorest countries on the Latin American mainland. However, in
contrast, it is one of the least densely settled, with an average of about 6.3
persons per square kilometer. Living conditions of the rural population are
characterized by a high birth rate (39.8/1,000 population) and high infant
mortality (84.3/1,000). Life expectancy is 61.8 years and adult illiteracy is
widespread.
2.02      Overall, the economy has grown at a faster rate during recent years
(7.5% GDP growth during 1972-74), particularly in the agricultural sector (9%
in 1973 and 1974), than in earlier years (5.2% GDP for the period 1965-74).
The trade balance has deteriorated from a small surplus in 1972 and 1973 to a
deficit of US$50 million in 1974, US$85.5 million in 1975 and an estimated
US$130.6 million for 1976 (Annex 1, Table 1) as imports have moved ahead of
export expansion which was stimulated by the initiation of Itaipu works (a
large hydroelectric project on the Parana River). The country's progress is
heavily dependent on a buoyant agricultural sector, which, in turn, must be
based increasingly on improved farming conditions for Paraguay's large popula-
tion of small farmers to augment its output of export crops.



-2 -
B. Agricultural Sector
Agriculture in the Economy
2.03      The agricultural sector is the major source of national income,
export earnings and employment. Approximately 35% of GDP, 97% of export
value (including wood and processed products), and 50% of employment are
provided by the sector (1975). The rate of growth in agricultural production
has been reasonably good, at about 6% annually for the 1970-75 period. Esti-
mates of crop growth rates show that the main export commodities have expanded
in volume at an average of 16.6% annually, compared with a rate of only 1.4%
p.a. for domestically consumed crops 1/. Continued investment in agricultural
development, particularly for the production of export produce, is considered
essential for Paraguay's economic progress (Annex 1).
Regional Setting and Land Use
2.04      The country can be divided into two major regions:  the Chaco and
Eastern Paraguay (Annex 1). The Chaco, composed of 24.7 million ha west of
the Paraguay River is virtually flat, sloping southward at a grade of less
than 1%. Its temperatures are usually high, and rainfall, averaging some
750 mm annually, is seasonally variable, thus making the region subject to
periodic drought. Occasional flooding also occurs, however, as the Chaco's
rivers swell with melting snow from the Andean highlands. Fresh water supplies
are limited and saline ground water limits the use of its relatively fertile
land. The Chaco is sparsely populated and the land is used mainly for exten-
sive cattle raising. Eastern Paraguay, comprising about 40% (16 million ha)
of the country and containing about 90% of the population, is a region of
spacious plains, broad valleys and low plateaus. Of an estimated 8 million ha
of potentially arable land in Eastern Paraguay, only 1 million are used for
agriculture. Much of the remaining land is covered with forest. Rainfall
averages 1,500 mm annually and is generally well distributed throughout the
year.
Land Distribution and Tenure
2.05      Some progress towards a more equitable distribution of potentially
productive land in Paraguay has been achieved primarily through colonization
of both Government and privately owned land. Though this effort has helped
ease the pressure on land, the distribution of land holdings is still uneven
(Annex 1). While land distribution could be improved through expropriation
from the private sector, particularly in Eastern Paraguay, a careful analysis
shows that most of the large holdings, which are situated in the Chaco region
and in the less productive or undeveloped areas of Eastern Paraguay, are
devoted to extensive livestock ranching or forestry and do not necessarily
represent a misallocation of land resources under present conditions. In
terms of land tenure, some 65% of all farmers owned their land in 1971, as
compared with 54% 10 years earlier (Annex 1).

- 3-
Crop Production and Farming Systems
2.06      Crop production is concentrated in the central part of the Eastern
Region which accounts for about half of the total output of the most important
crops: cassava, soybeans, corn, cotton, tobacco, oranges, wheat, sugarcane,
castor seed, and coffee.  Other important producing subregions are Itapua,
Concepcion-San Pedro, and Alto Parana, which, together, account for about 40%
of total crop production. Future expansion of production is likely to occur
in Itapua and Alto Parana as these regions already have two well-established
poles of development between which lie about 1 million ha of undeveloped land
suitable for crop production. The proposed project is designed to develop this
area. Crop production in the Chaco region is not likely to increase signifi-
cantly during the next five years as its potential lies mainly in extensive
livestock production (Annex 1, Tables 2 and 3).
2.07      There are three principal crop farming systems in Paraguay, recog-
nizable by the type of farm power involved: (a) subsistence, or traditional,
farming, which depends solely on family labor; (b) more progressive traditional,
or small commercial, farming, which draws its farm power requirements from draft
animals; and (c) commercial farming, primarily in and around the Japanese,
German, and Mfennonite settlements, depending mainly on tractors.
2.08      The subsistence, or traditional, farms with only manual labor,
derive over half their production from the three subsistence crops--maize,
cassava and beans. Farmers with draft animals plant about 30% of their land
in the three subsistence crops. The tractor-powered farms produce little or
none of the subsistence crops, concentrating on double cropping of wheat with
soybean or single cropping cotton. In and around the larger towns, vegetables
make up an important part of small cultivators' cash crop production.
Agricultural Services
2.09      Land Settlement and Colonization.  Land settlement and colonization
are the responsibility of the Institute of Rural Welfare (IBR). IBR was
established under law 852 of 1963 as an autonomous agency to determine and
execute policy in respect of land reform, land settlement and rural affairs
under the provisions of the Agrarian Statute and related legislation. The
President of IBR and the five-member council are given broad authority in
dealing with these matters even though IBR's official channel of communication
is through the Minister of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG) (Annex 2).
2.10      IBR works mainly with state lands entrusted to its control.
Colonies may be for livestock, agriculture/forestry or agricultural produc-
tion, and the majority are located in the Eastern Region, where the average
size of an individual farm plot is 20 ha. On the basis of an average family
size of six persons, it is estimated that over 21% of the rural population of
Paraguay now live in official Government colonies. This effort has been
largely financed out of IBR's own resources and at the relatively low settle-
ment cost of approximately US$300 per family. When health, education and
other services provided by Government are included, the total settlement cost
per family is estimated to be US$500.



2.11      Extension.  Se' er  'Covernment institutions provide technical
assistance to farmers: -he AAG through its various commodity divisions and
Extension Service and Small Farmer Credit Agency (CAH), the IBR, and the
National D veJopment Bank (BNF). The National Service of Professional
Promotion 'SNPP), being expanded and improved under the Bank's Second
Education .roject, trains skilled and semi-skilled agriculturalists, using
mobile un-ts a.nd short courses in regional training centers.  The main respon-
sibility for providing technical assistance to farmers at the field level,
however, -rsts with the Agricultural Extension Service (SEAG), which has 23
field offices distributed throughout the country, covering 12% of the number
of dist:icts in Paraguay (estimated at about 180).  SEAG has a technical staff
of 79 and a countrywide coverage of about one technician to 2,500 farmers, and
concentrates on promoting export crop development, particularly tobacco and
cotton (Annex 1).
2.12      Research.  Agricultural research is carried out by both MAG and the
National University. Works programs are crop-oriented, primarily in terms of
technical factors, but often there is no thorough economic and financial
assessment of the farming system recommended (Annex 1). USAID plans to assist
MAG in upgrading research that will benefit small farmers by: (a) expanding
research programs oriented toward their needs; (b) establishing a research
training program within MAG; (c) expanding the Ministry's Planning Office to
deal with economic analysis and planning of rural development programs; and
(d) creating a funding mechanism to provide the National Seed Service (SENASE)
with resources to secure, process and distribute improved seed varieties.
Agricultural Credit
2.13      Institutional credit to the agricultural sector in Paraguay is
provided by the banking system, controlled by the Central Bank (CB), through
the state-owned BNF and 13 commercial banks. In addition, CB provides funds
for on-lending through the Livestock Fund (FG), using IDA and IBRD funds. FG
is now the principal source of long-term credit to the livestock sub-sector,
holding by the end of 1975 a portfolio of G 3,619 million (US$28.7 million).
Some agricultural credit is also provided by a number of smaller, non-bank
institutions, in particular the state-owned CAH and the privately owned
Paraguayan Development Company (COMDESA), which are subject to certain
provisions of the General Banking Law and to the control of CB. A reportedly
substantial but unquantifiable amount of non-institutional credit is provided
by traders and agricultural produce merchants.
2.14      BNF is by far the most important source of credit to the agricul-
tural sector. In 1975, it granted loans to the crop sub-sector totalling
G 2,459 million (US$79.5 million), which represented 61% of total bank credit
extended to the sub-sector during the year, compared to 90% in 1970. BNF's
portfolio of loans outstanding to the crop sub-sector rose from C 3,518
million (US$27.9 million) at the end of 1970 to G 7,402 million (US$58.7
million) at the end of 1975 (Annex 3).



2.15      The commercial banks, mostly affiliates of foreign banks, have been
historically reluctant to finance the crop sub-sector but, in recent years,
they have substantially increased credit to crop farmers, which is primarily
short term and highly selective (emphasizing large farmers, machinery, and
specialized crop production such as wheat and cotton).
2.16      CAH is a small farmer credit agency within MAG which provides
short-term subsidized credit to members of newly formed farmers' associations
at an interest rate of 9% per annum, plus a 2% commission fee. Loan disburse-
ments increased from G 9.9 million (US$78,000) in 1971/72 to G 83.3 million
(US$661,000) in 1975/76.
2.17      COMIDESA is a private development bank which finances investments
in development-oriented projects, including, where necessary, feasibility
studies and technical assistance. During the six years of its existence,
COMDESA had approved financing for 272 projects, totalling G 1,389 million
(US$11.0 million), of which 2% was for crops, 31% for livestock, and 34% for
agroindustries.
2.18      Although no firm data are available, it is estimated that non-
institutional credit provided by shopkeepers, input suppliers, and produce
merchants reaches some 17% of farmers, while institutional credit reaches
only about 7%. Interest rates on non-institutional credit generally are
very high and often are hidden in the purchase of output at lower than
market prices.
Cooperatives and Farmer Associations
2.19      The cooperative movement has gained momentum in Paraguay, supported
by development promoted by foreign immigrants. Some successful cooperatives
have been established by Mennonite colonies in the Chaco, while others have
been established by German and Japanese settlers in Itapua and the central
region. Recently, the movement has spread to small farm areas through the
Paraguayan Union of Cooperatives (UNIPACO), a marketing organization that
is expanding its activities with USAID assistance. Its network of local
cooperatives presently covers 21 locations in Eastern Paraguay. Mutual help
among farmers is a common practice in Paraguay, and many such groups (mingas)
exist in the Itapua area (Annex 1).
Program Administration
2.20      Since 1972, the National Council for Social Progress (CNPS) has been
responsible for planning and supervising integrated rural development programs
in 23 public colonies in Paraguay's northern axis and for coordination of the
various institutions involved in the IDA-assisted First Rural Development
Project in eastern Paraguay. The CNPS was established by Presidential decree
in 1967 as an interministerial organization in which IBR and BNF are also
represented (Annex 1).

C. Rural Infrastructure and Services
Roads
2.21      The Highways Authority (DGV) within the Ministry of Public Works
and Communication (MOPC) is responsible for planning, constructing and
maintaining all national and departmental roads in the country (about 80% of
the entire network). The primary highway network in Paraguay totals about
6,500 km, of which more than three-quarters are earth. The network as a whole
provides acceptable transport to most of the populated areas of the country
but some of the existing paved and gravel roads need to be improved to meet
growing traffic volumes and to facilitate the development of new agricultural
areas. Responsibility for construction and maintenance of feeder roads is
entrusted to two other departments within MOPC -- the Road Authority and
Mineral Authority (Annex 1).
Education
2.22      Education in Paraguay is improving at a rapid rate, supported by
Bank lending. The third education project (US$8 million loan, and
US$4 million IDA credit) will help finance primary and secondary school
facilities in Paraguay, with emphasis on the rural and semirural population.
It provides for a school construction program to service the proposed project
area. Overall, Paraguay's eductional system is characterized by high dropout
and repetition rates are reflected in nationwide completion rates of only 26%
at the primary level and 41% at the secondary level. Secondary school
enrollment has increased by 8.3% per year during the past 10 years but
the increase has benefitted mainly urban children. In 1974 total secondary
enrollment was about 72,000, or 10% of the 13 to 18 year age group, some 46%
of which is in Asuncion (Annex 1).
Health
2.23      The quality of medical services in Paraguay is generally satisfactory
in that major diseases, such as malaria, poliomyelitis and leprosy, have been
largely controlled, but major deficiencies exist in the diffusion of medical
services and health education to rural areas. Nutritionally, deficiencies of
certain vitamins and minerals are evident in a diet heavy on cassava, beef,
maize and wheat derivatives, and weak on dairy products, green vegetables and
fresh fruit. Malnutrition, particularly in low income families, is evidenced
by slow physical development and maturation.
2.24      The improvement of rural health infrastructure has been included as
part of the current National Health Plan. A total of 112 new rural health
posts is planned for the entire rural area during the next five years.
Also, 20 new health centers are planned for population clusters of 2,000
to 20,000 inhabitants (Annex 1).

D. Government Strategy in Rural Development
2.25      The Government, aware of the country's unexploited agricultural
potential, has committed itself to a policy of increasing the production
of exportable agricultural commodities and expanding the area under cultiva-
tion through the colonization of virgin lands (Annex 2). The IBR has estab-
lished some 250 colonies of over 40,000 families on unused state lands for
settlers from the Asuncion minifundia zone, which has led to a proliferation
of potentially viable farm units in the more fertile areas of Eastern
Paraguay. The colonization program has concentrated on settling the largest
number of families at the lowest possible cost, basing development largely
on family self-reliance. Although this policy opened rich new lands to agri-
cultural production and brought about major changes in the land tenure struc-
ture, existing institutions have been unable to provide colonies with needed
services and infrastructure, and as a result, the standard of living of many
colonists remains at the subsistence level. Government is now interested in
correcting the situation to prevent the deterioration of settlements and
proliferation of subsistence farming. The proposed project would assist in
this effort and support a more controlled pattern of regional development
designed to assure the rational exploitation of land, water, and forestry
resources. It would supplement existing rural development programs financed
by the Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), USAID, and other
lending and aid agencies (Annex 1).
E. Performance Under the First Rural Development Project
2.26      The First Rural Development Project (Credit 509 of September 6, 1974)
included a lending program to finance on-farm investments and incremental
working capital for about 2,000 small farmers; the construction of about 60 km
of all-weather roads and 250 km of earth roads, 26 primary schools, two health
centers (plus the purchase of equipment for a third), three community centers,
the purchase of some 50 vehicles for technical staff, and the appointment of a
Project Coordinator (Annex 4). Project policy is established by CNPS and.
implementation is being undertaken by BNF, MOPC, MAG, IBR, Ministry of Educa-
tion, and Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare (MSPBS). The Project
Coordinator works with these agencies through CNPS.
2.27      From the beginning of the lending program through the end of February
1977, 861 long-term subloans for US$2.2 million had been committed, in compari-
son with the appraisal estimate of 1,200 subloans for US$3.4 million through
the end of 1976. For the same period, 1,102 short-term subloans for US$0.7
million had been committed, compared with the appraisal estimate of 1,200
subloans for US$2 million. IBR had issued 707 titles, compared with the
appraisal estimate of 1,200 by the end of 1976. Various factors might have
contributed to the failure to reach projected targets: the lending program
was initiated six months later than expected, partly because of a delay of
four months in effectiveness; IBR was initially slow in assigning land titles,
although this process was expedited by the issuance of temporary certificates



- 8 -
beginning in September 1975; BNF did not assign its full complement of tech-
nicians to the project area until September 1976; many farmers are not familiar
with debt financing and are reluctant to incur debt; and substantial farmer
liquidity, resulting from favorable crop prices, reduced the total demand for,
and average size of, subloans. As a result, full commitment of subloan funds
will be achieved by about the end of 1978, or one year later than the appraisal
estimate.
2.28      During the design phase of the roads, temporary improvements were
made to existing earth tracks to provide easier market access for farmers.
About 700 km of tracks had been improved through February 1977. Construction
of new roads was started in October 1976 and is expected to be completed by
the end of 1978. Because of unforeseen cost increases, the schools component
had to be modified and now includes 19 primary schools with 92 classrooms, as
compared with the appraisal estimate of 26 schools with 102 classrooms.
Nine schools were completed by December 1976, and the remainder are expected
to be completed to start operation in June 1978. The health component, how-
ever, was expanded to include the construction of three health centers, as
compared with the appraisal estimate of two. Their construction was completed
by December 1976, and equipment for the three centers is expected to be
delivered by September 1977. Construction of the three community centers is
scheduled for completion by the end of 1977. Twenty-five vehicles were
purchased instead of the 50 proposed at appraisal.
2.29      In view of the important role of BNF in agricultural credit in
Paraguay, agreement was reached, under the First Project, on various steps
to be taken to strengthen its financial position, including a Government
equity contribution of US$1.2 million equivalent per year, planned efforts for
the recovery of loans in arrears, and maintenance of minimal liquidity and
debt/ equity ratios. Government has made contributions to BNF's paid-in
capital as contemplated, but its financial position has deteriorated because
of continuing operational losses and the need for additional provisions
emerging from the auditors' analysis of its loan portfolio. As for the
reduction of arrears, BNF undertook to (a) strengthen its loan recovery office
and collection procedures, (b) recover no less than 20% of the overdue loans
under the National Grain Program (NGP) made prior to December 31, 1972, (c)
present a plan to recover the principal of the remaining NGP loans by May 1983
and outstanding interest by May 1988, and (d) present and implement a plan to
reduce all the other arrears to no more than 10% of the portfolio of each
Department by September 6, 1976. BNF has met the first two conditions satis-
factorily but did not meet the latter two on schedule. However, BNF has now
formulated and adopted recovery plans for its entire overdue portfolio with
the help of its external auditors and the Bank. A loan recovery plan, in-
cluding realistic schedules and goals consistent with BNF's organizational
capacity, has been discussed and finalized in connection with the processing
of the proposed industrial credit project, and the proposed project
(para. 3.25).
Evaluation
2.30      It is too early to determine project impact on production, but the
implementation of farm development plans and the construction of infrastructure



- 9 -
facilities are proceeding satisfactorily after a slow start. A system to mea-
sure project impact is being developed and will be formalized in the proposed
second project. Project cost per farm family was just over US$1,000 (exclud-
ing credit).
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Area
3.01      The area of the proposed project is located in the southern part of
the Eastern Region, along the Parana River, which divides Paraguay from
Argentina, and for purposes of the project, has been divided into areas A and
B (refer Mlaps). Project area A, just east of Encarnacion and encompassing
about 80,000 ha and 22,000 settlers, is relatively well developed, while area
B, further east running along the Parana River to Itapua's northern boundary,
and covering about 110,000 ha occupied by 28,000 settlers, on about 5,000
farms, plus 125,000 ha available for settlement, requires substantial infra-
structure investment. This area is still, for the most part, covered with
original forest and, until timber operations started some 20 years ago, was
completely isolated. The Parana River was the only means of access to area B
until the 1960s, when an earth road was built to Capitan Meza. Most of the
area north of the Tembey River, however, is still accessible only by river
craft to the small settlements along the Parana, and thence by logging tracks,
which penetrate from 20 km to 75 km into the forest in a northwesterly direc-
tion. There are upwards of 16 riverside villages but none has even rudimentary
port facilities. Other tracks, which have been developed by settlers, meander
haphazardly but predominantly along a southwest-northeast axis. Except where
farm land has been cleared alongside earth tracks, mainly in the southern
part, clearing has been minimal and seldom exceeds the width of the track.
The southwest boundary of area B is about 84 km distant from Encarnacion by
earth road, paved with stone in some sections, while vehicular access to the
northeastern corner is possible in dry weather by an earth track from Puerto
Presidente Stroessner, about 100 km to the north. This track is intended to
be improved by army engineers but only to earth standards, and several rivers
will remain unbridged. Health services in area B are inadequate, with only
three health centers of the lowest category (type D) and three health posts.
All are ill-equipped and inadequately staffed. Annex 5 has further details.
B. Brief Description
3.02      The project would provide funds for supervised farm credit covering
both areas A and B, as well as infrastructural and administrative investments
for area B. Small farmers would be the principal beneficiaries as they work
to clear the forest for crop land. Investments in infrastructure would in-
clude an expanded road network and regional health system. Administratively,
the line agencies (BNF, MAG and IBR) would be strengthened by additional
staffing to improve basic services to project area B, working through two
new community centers under the control and supervision of CNPS.



- 10 -
3.03      Loan proceeds would be channelled through the Central Bank (CB) to
the various executing institutions as follows: farm credit by the BNF, roads
and administrative centers by MOPC, health centers by MSPBS, agricultural
extension by MAG, and land demarcation and titling by the IBR. All work would
be coordinated by CNPS, which would appoint two Coordinators. No education
component is included as the cost of the proposed school program for project
area B has been incorporated in the Bank's third education project (1269-PA).
C. Detailed Features
Farm Credit
3.04      About 3,555 farmers would receive long-term credit to finance
investments and short-term credit to finance incremental working capital
requirements; 600 of these farmers would be in area A and 2,955 in area B,
as shown below. Two main types of farmers would participate. The first type,
with 20 ha or less, would number about 3,060, of whom 370 are located in area
A and 2,690 in area B. Such farmers would have approximately 5 ha partially
cleared and farmed primarily with family labor. Under the project, they would
destump the 5 ha currently farmed and cut about 2 ha of forest. One ha would
be put under pasture for feeding draft oxen and minor livestock and the
remaining 6 ha would be cropped. Crops would be mainly maize, cassava, beans,
and soybeans. Investments would be primarily in cutting and destumping (29%),
fencing (8%), draft animals (21%), equipment (18%), and storage facilities
(6%) and incremental working capital (18%). The amount of investment per farm
would be about G 388,600 (US$3,100) (Annex 6).
3.05      About 495 farmers would be of the second type, with  between 20 and
50 ha, of whom 230 are located in area A and 265 in area B. These farmers
would have about 8 ha destumped and 6 ha cut; those 14 ha would be farmed
primarily with oxen and family labor. Under the project, they would destump
the 6 ha of cut land. A farmer would be eligible to purchase a tractor
provided he has made appropriate arrangements to utilize each tractor on a
minimum of 40 ha per year. These arrangements might involve group purchase of
a tractor or agreements to undertake custom work for neighboring farmers. An
assurance on this matter was obtained at negotiations. The main crops
would be soybeans, wheat, tung (for oil), maize, cassava, and beans. Invest-
ments would be primarily in destumping (9%), tractor and implements (67%), and
incremental working capital (24%). Investment per farm would amount to about
G 1,260,800 (US$10,000) (Annex 6). Participation is expected to be as follows:

Roads
3.06      The project would finance construction of a road network in area B
costing US$12.9 million that would bring almost all farmers in the area to
within 5 km of a road. The network would include 99 km of all-weather roads,
providing direct access to the whole of area B, with about 238 km of feeder
earth roads, mostly on the river side (Annex 7). Investments would cover
civil works such as land clearing, cutting, drainage and erosion control,
culverts and bridges, and stone paving for the all-weather component (78%);
supervision (7%); equipment (10%); and maintenance (5%). Provision would be
made under the project for consultants to supervise the execution of the work.
Civil works for all-weather roads would be done under contract while civil
works for the earth roads may be done either under contract or force account,
according to the available resources of DGV. Roads in area A are adequate to
meet project needs.
Health
3.07      The project would develop a rural health services delivery system,
based on community organization and auxiliary personnel. Task assignments
would stress environmental sanitation and communicable disease control, health
and nutrition education, as well as mother and child health and family plan-
ning. The project would finance construction (57%) and equipping (21%) of
eight community health posts, two new health centers, and two upgraded centers
in area B. Funding for operational costs (18%), including staff, and training
expenses (4%) would also be provided during the three-year disbursement period
after which time the Government would be responsible for maintaining the facil-



- 12 -
ities. Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations. Existing
staff from MSPBS would be responsible for training auxiliary personnel, with
some foreign technical assistance. Provision for short-term visits by tech-
nical specialists from overseas has been included within the training compo-
nent (Annex 7).
Community Centers
3.08      The project would finance construction of two community centers in
area B adjacent to the proposed all-weather road (Annex 7). Investments would
consist of civil works (85%) and equipment (15%). The first and principal
center would be located roughly at km 38 (at Domingo Robledo) and the second
near km 98 (in the Otano area). Each center would consist of office accommoda-
tion, conference room, warehouse, and vehicle maintenance workshop, with power
and water supplies, basic office equipment, furniture, and a radio link. Some
staff housing and resthouses, intended for the use of project staff during
implementation, and for Government and local officials on completion, would
also be provided (Annex 7).
Vehicles
3.09      The project would help finance the purchase of about thirty-nine
vehicles, mostly four-wheel-drive jeeps, costing US$0.3 million. The vehicles
would be used by all incremental project staff, the Project Coordinator,
the Deputy Coordinator, and the Farm Management Adviser. Operational costs
for the first three years of the project would also be covered. The community
centers would be provided with electrical generators and equipped service
workshops, together with fuel outlets. The service facility would be leased
on a private contractual basis during the disbursement phase of the project
(Annex 7).
Coordination
3.10      Equipment and operational expenses relevant to the Project Coor-
dinator, Deputy Coordinator and support staff would be financed up to US$0.03
million. Maintenance and operational expenses for the coordinators' two
vehicles would also be covered during the disbursement period (Annex 7).
Personnel
3.11      Present staff available in area A can service most of the project
requirements. However, two additional BNF and two MAG technicians would be
provided in the first year (Annex 7). Present staff in area B cannot be
expected to meet the demand for services in this region. Provision has
therefore been made under the project to provide, as and when needed, addi-
tional personnel, including the two coordinators, 14 MAG technicians, 14 BNF
technicians, 14 IBR technicians, and supporting administrative staff (Annex 7,
Table 7). An internationally recruited consultant would be appointed by
August 31, 1977, financed by UNDP, for three years to provide a farm manage-
ment input to the credit program. (The proposal for UNDP assistance is being
processed.) Initially, he would work out of the MAG extension office in
Encarnacion, but later would move to the main community center in area B.



- 13 -
He would work under the Project Coordinator. Assurances that the above ap-
pointments would be made and that the technicians would stay in the project
area were obtained at negotiations.
D. Cost Estimates
3.12      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$42.8 million, of
which US$24.6 million, or 57%, represents the foreign exchange component.
Costs have been based on September 1976 prices, with a physical contingency
of 10% added overall. A price contingency of 31% of baseline costs has
also been added, based on the assumption that the dollar costs of civil works
and related investment items would rise by 9.5%, 9.0%, 9.0%, and 8.5%, res-
pectively, over the next four years from appraisal, and that the cost of
equipment, vehicles, and similar items would rise by 7.75%, 7.5%, 7.5% and
7.25%, respectively, over the same period. Area A is treated separately since
it is not to be financed by the Bank. Total project cost for area A is esti-
mated to be US$5 million, of which US$2.6 million, or 52%, is foreign exchange.
Farm investment items for area A, with their respective foreign exchange
components, are compared with those for area B in Annex 6, Table 5. The total
cost for area B is estimated at US$38 million, of which US$22 million, or 58%,
represents the foreign exchange component, details of which are provided in
Annex 7, Table 13. Project costs are summarized in the table on the next
page.
3.13      For the supervised credit and vehicle components, baseline
figures are current guarani costs as of September 1976 on imported vehicles,
farm machinery and equipment, chemicals and operating capital at farm level.
For the road component, labor costs are based on salaries and wages actually
paid by the DGV. Equipment costs were estimated using international bids for
similar items received by DGV. All costs were checked against net rates
obtained in recent contracts and current force account rates for civil works
on road construction and maintenance. For the health and community centers,
personnel and administration expense cost estimates are based on local prices,
particularly for civil works, and international prices where relevant. For
the technical assistance and training components, basic costs are comparable
to those incurred under the first project and other current studies and
training programs in Paraguay.

The project is divided into two sub-projects (area A and area B) financed
from four sources: subborrowers (farmers), the Government, the Bank and the
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW). KfW would be responsible for area A,
project costs of which are US$5 million. If the KfW credit covers only foreign
exchange, it would be for US$2.6 million (52%). The Government would provide
US$2.0 million (39%) and subborrowers US$0.4 million (9%). Project costs for
area B amount to US$38 million, net of taxes, and would be met partly by the
Bank, US$22 million (58%) covering the foreign exchange component; partly by
Government, US$14.4 million (38%); and partly by subborrowers, US$1.4 million
(4%). Design and document preparation costs for civil works in area B, amount-
ing to US$1.08 million (Annex 7, Table 14), would be covered by the Bank's
Preinvestment Studies Project (587-PA). The overall Government contribution
to the project totals US$16.4 million and includes the contributions of CB and
BNF to the farm credit component.



- 16 -
3.15      The KfW credit would be for 30 years, including 10 years of grace,
at an interest rate of 2% per annum. The Bank loan would be made to the
Government at 8.2% for 17 years, including 3.5 years of grace. The Government
would bear the foreign exchange risk and make available the proceeds of the
loan to the Central Bank for financing the different project components.
Assurances on these points were obtained during negotiations. A subsidiary
loan agreement between the government, the CB and BNF, acceptable to the Bank,
would stipulate the terms and conditions on which the Bank loan proceeds would
be passed on to BNF for carrying out the farm credit component of the project.
The execution of the subsidiary loan agreement would be a condition of
effectiveness.
F.   Procurement
3.16      Goods and services financed with the proceeds of the proposed loan
would be procured as follows: (a) as is usual in agriculture credit projects,
farm inputs (US$11.0 million) would be procured through regular commercial
channels; (b) contracts for the construction of all-weather roads (US$4.8
million), as well as M4OPC, CNPS, IBR and MAG equipment (US$1.53 million), and
vehicles (US$0.31 million) would be procured through international competitive
bidding; (c) health and community facility construction (US$1.33 million),
with furniture and equipment (US$0.36 million), would be procured on the basis
of local competitive bidding; and (d) civil works for earth roads (US$5.0
million) would be carried out on force account provided MOPC has the technical
capability to perform the work. Assurances on the above were obtained during
negotiations.
G. Disbursements
3.17      Since commitment of subloans by BNF would extend over three years,
Bank disbursements would spread over three and a half years (Annex 8). The
Bank would disburse 100% of foreign expenditures for vehicles and equipment,
and for consulting services; 66% for civil works, training and project admin-
istration; and 47% for farm credit (Annex 7, Table 13). The price contingency
component would remain unallocated.
H. Organization and Management
Administration
3.18      CNPS would coordinate the operations of the various agencies involved
in the project both at the national and field levels. The performance of CNPS
under the first project, as well as its interministerial character, makes it
the most suitable coordinating agency for the project. CNPS has appointed a
Project Coordinator who would be stationed in Asuncion and would be responsible



- 17 -
for the overall project. A Deputy Coordinator would also be appointed by
August 31, 1977 to coordinate and supervise at the field level, reporting
directly to the Project Coordinator in Asuncion. During negotiations, assur-
ances were obtained that both the appointment would be made (with duties set
out in Annex 7, Appendix 3) and that it would be subject to Bank approval
and that CNPS would ensure close cooperation among the participating agencies,
require each of them to assign an officer to program with the Project Coordi-
nator, and to prepare annual programs for the project and periodic progress
reports. Assurances were also obtained that roads, buildings, and equipment
included in the project would be adequately maintained after its completion.
Farm Credit
3.19      General.  The lending program that would finance on-farm investments
and incremental working capital would be managed by BNF (Annex 3), with
the cooperation of MAG in the provision of technical assistance to project
beneficiaries. MAG extension agents would be responsible for recommending
improved production techniques to the farmers, as well as drawing up farm
plans with BNF technicians, and for animal health, including supply of vaccine
and inoculation of oxen financed in both project areas. Area A would be
serviced mainly by existing staff from both the Encarnacion and Hohenau
extension offices.
3.20      Lending Operations.  MAG extensionists and BNF technicians, working
individually or in combination, would assist farmers in preparing subloan
applications based on farm plans. The applications would be submitted to BNF
for determining creditworthiness and legal requirements and would be approved
by BNF and by the Project Coordinator. During implementation of the plans, MAG
extensionists and BNF technicians would provide technical assistance to the
farmers. MAG and BNF would be assisted in this work by an internationally
recruited farm management specialist, financed by UNDP. Collection of subloans
would be the responsibility of BNF, which would also collect farmers' land
payments on behalf of IBR.
3.21      tAG and BNF would appoint two technicians each to work with sub-
borrowers in area A and 14 technicians each to work with the project bene-
ficiaries in area B (Annex 7), during the course of the project. Initially,
the BNF technicians in area B would be responsible to a new office to be
opened in Capitan Meza at the southern border of the area in 1977. Later, as
the demand for credit expanded, one or two more offices would be established
within the area, according to BNF policy. Assurances on the above were
obtained during negotiations.
3.22      The farm credit portion of the proceeds of the Bank loan and that
of KfW would be onlent by CB to BNF. CB would rediscount 62% of the subloan
amount at 7% interest, a rate approximately equivalent to the blended cost of
KfW and Bank funds. BNF would repay to CB funds so lent, over a period of
17 years, including a grace period of three years and a half. BNF would
finance the remaining portion of subloans (38%) from its own resources which
are being substantially strengthened through additional Government equity
contributions (para 3.26). Subloans for incremental working capital would



- 18 -
have maximum maturity of one year and normally would be granted only to
farmers implementing an investment plan under the project. Subloans for
investments would have a maturity of not more than 10 years, including a
maximum of three years' grace. No subloans, or combination thereof, to an
individual sub-borrower would exceed US$50,000. Not more than US$1,730,000
of the Bank loan proceeds would be withdrawn for subloans to beneficiaries
with more than 20 ha, of which, again, no more than US$1 million would be
allocated to farmers with 50 ha or more. Farmers would be required to con-
tribute at least 10% of the project cost and BNF would provide sufficient
short-term loans to subborrowers to cover additional working capital require-
ments. BNF would recognize either a certificate of ownership from IBR or a
normal land title as meeting the requirements for an investment subloan.
Subloans would yield BNF a minimum of 13% per annum, including interest and
commissions. As the consumer price index currently is rising at an annual
rate of about 6%, the real cost of the subloans would be roughly 7% per annum.
This real cost is above that in most other Latin American countries for loans
to the agricultural sector and is the same as that stipulated for the proposed
Industrial Credit Project. Assurances that subloans would be made on the
terms and conditions set out above were obtained at negotiations.
3.23      BNF.  In 1975 and 1976, BNF incurred losses of about US$2.6 million
and US$8.5 million respectively, mainly as a result of provisions for un-
collectable loans. These losses are expected to decline to about US$0.7
million in 1977. Considering these losses and the increases resulting from
Government capital contributions during the year, BNF's equity at the end of
1976 was about US$10.5 million and its total debt/ equity ratio about 12.9:1.
Arrears as of December 31, 1976 amounted to approximately 22% of portfolio.
3.24      Recognizing the grave difficulties confronting BNF, the Government
installed a new management team at the beginning of 1976 with a firm mandate
to transform the bank into a viable institution. In the context of the pro-
posed Industrial Credit Project, the Bank has agreed with BNF on a financial
and institutional rehabilitation program which involves, inter alia, a Govern-
ment equity contribution (para 3.26), increasing the average yield on loans
granted from about 11.2% in 1975 to a minimum of 13% by the end of 1978,
decreasing operating costs to 5.4% of portfolio by the end of 1978, and
reducing arrears (para. 3.25). 1/ As part of its effort to fulfill these
objectives, BNF, with the assistance of a UNDP supported technical assistance
program, would establish a programming and budgeting office, improve its
accounting system, and formulate a manpower development plan. Assurances
were obtained that BNF would take appropriate measures to comply with the
above requirements.
3.25      In order to improve its recovery performance and reduce its ex-
posure on agricultural credit programs, BNF intends to strengthen its Recovery
Office and proposes to transfer to this unit all loans in arrears for more
than a given period and to initiate a new procedure for recovering the pay-
ments overdue. Arrangements have been made for data collection on overdue
1/ Further details of BNF's financial position and the rehabilitation plan
are given in the appraisal report of the proposed Industrial Credit
Project.



- 19 -
loans and for designing control and procedures for a more effective recovery
system. Accordingly, BNF adopted on April 5, 1977, by resolution of its
Administrative Council, a debt recovery plan for its entire portfolio for-
mulated with assistance from its external auditor and the Bank, including
collection goals commensurate with its organizational and manpower capacity.
These goals are to reduce BNF arrears to 15% of the total portfolio by
December 31, 1978 and to 10% by December 31, 1978. It is a condition of loan
effectiveness that BNF shall have adopted a manual for debt collection and
that the measures required to carry out the debt recovery plan are being
taken.
3.26      To strengthen BNF's financial structure and position, the government
has agreed to make capital contributions of about G 2,437 million (US$19.3
million) to be paid in over the 1977-80 period. This would compensate for
past substantial decapitalization, likely losses in the immediate future, and
support additional internal and external borrowing needed to finance BNF's
development lending. The government has already taken appropriate measures
to provide G 1,137 million (US$9.0 million). It would now need to make, in
addition, an immediate contribution of about G 1,300 million (US$10.3 million).
Assurances were, therefore, obtained that prior to loan effectiveness, the
Government would make such a contribution. These capital contributions,
together with BNF's improved operating efficiency, would permit the reduction
of the total debt/equity ratio to 6.6:1 by December 31, 1977. An assurance
was also obtained that BNF would maintain a ratio not to exceed 8:1. This
assurance, and the one on the debt recovery plan (para. 3.25), modify the
targets set under the Small Farmer Credit and Rural Development Project.
3.27      Land Survey and Titling.  Under the project, land demarcation and
titling would be the responsibility of TBR. IBR's role under the project
would be to carry out a land demarcation and titling program of sufficient
magnitude to assure a solid base of titled land holders within the project
area, who could then qualify for on-farm credit. While the relatively high
proportion of land owners (nearly 50%) in area A means that a farm credit
program could be initiated soon after project approval, in area B, a land
demarcation and titling program would be a prerequisite to successful project
implementation. Of the estimated 5,000 farm families in this area, some 4,400
do not have land titles and with the influx of settlers expected under the
project, this figure could rise to 7,600 by 1980 (Annex 2). In order to get a
headstart on project lending, IBR would begin work in the southern part of
area B (south of the Tembey River) during 1977 and 440 titles should be
granted in this area by the end of November. Assurances to this effect were
obtained during negotiations. Specified annual quotas of titles should be met
before spring (September) each year so that farmers have adequate time to
prepare farm plans and complete credit requirements with BNF for the following
summer cropping season. During the first year of project execution, one IBR
field supervisor and six technicians would be assigned to area B and they too
would concentrate on land regularization and titling among already established
settlers in the area south of the Tembey. As bridge and road construction
opens up new lands for settlement north of the river, seven more technicians
would be added in year 2 and one in year 3 to work with incoming settlers.



- 20 -
Lot boundaries would be clearly indicated before titles were granted in order
to avoid subsequent disputes over land ownership. In order to avoid delays in
the farmers' access to credit, the IBR would grant "certificates of intent to
issue titles" for periods of up to six months to farmers upon payment of 10%
of the value of their land purchase. Assurances to this effect were obtained
during negotiations. In addition to granting titles to sub-borrowers under
the project, the IBR would also strive to grant titles to other settlers
currently in area B as well as to other incoming settlers. A proposed sched-
ule for land titling is presented in Annex 2.
Roads
3.28      Existing communications are so difficult in the project area that
road construction should begin as soon after loan signing as possible. Due to
inadequacies of staffing, DGV is not organized to cope with major construction
works by force account and depends heavily on consultants and contractors to
carry out specific projects. Therefore, construction of all-weather roads
and structures for the project would be undertaken by contractors, while the
improvement of existing tracks and the construction of earth roads, to supple-
ment the more permanent road network :would be done under force account, pro-
vided DGV has the technical capability to perform the work. Consultants
would provide DGV with a complete service for supervision of new construction,
and advise and assist the Government with improvement And maintenance programs.
Consulting engineers would be recruited early in 1977, under the Preinvestment
Studies Project (587-PA), to undertake design and document preparation work.
Existing facilities of MOPC at Encarnacion and in or near the project area are
considered adequate to handle this work.
Health
3.29      The expansion of the health program would be administered by the
Regional Director of MSPBS through the Ministry of Health offices in Encarna-
cion, utilizing the new and upgraded centers as they emerge, together with the
improved and new health posts. He will be responsible for the civil works and
procurement under the project. Staffing for the new centers and posts is pro-
vided for under operational costs amounting to US$205,000 (Annex 7, Table 11).
Community Centers
3.30      Two centers would be constructed by the MOPC in the first year of
the project. They would contain offices for project implementing staff from
BNF, MAG and IBR, under the supervision and direction of the two Project
Coordinators appointed by CNPS. At the end of the three-year disbursement
period, the centers would be transferred to appropriate Government agencies
for use and maintenance.
Evaluation
3.31      A system of project monitoring and evaluation would be established
within CNPS by not later than January 1, 1978. As data accumulate in the line
agencies and appear in reports by field technicians to their Asuncion offices,



- 21 -
the information would be screened on a selective basis to develop a monitoring
and evaluation system which would be reviewed in association with project
supervision by Bank staff.
Accounts and Auditing
3.32      Project accounts would be established by the Central Bank, BNF, CNPS,
MAG, MOPC, and MSPBS. BNF's financial accounts, and the project account in
BNF, would be audited annually by an external auditor acceptable to the Bank.
The project audit would comment on the fulfillment of project conditions and
would include field spot checks of subloans. The project accounts of CNPS,
MAG, MOPC, and MSPBS would be audited by the Ministry of Finance, as has been
agreed for the on-going project. In all cases, the audit reports would
describe the procedures followed and the checks undertaken. Certified copies
of the audited financial statements and signed copies of the auditors' reports,
including that of BNF's financial accounts, would be sent to the Bank within
four months of the end of the year. Assurances on the above were obtained
at negotiations.

result of improved infrastructure (mainly roads).

The project would result in incremental annual production of 63,300 metric
tons of produce, worth US$6.6 million, at present prices, at a cost of about
US$15 million (before contingencies) in non-recoverable items such as road and
community center construction and equipment; health systems; vehicles and
administration. There is no provision under the project to directly recover
these investments, but IBR will recover some of the outlay through land sales
to settlers. It is expected that land will be sold to farm settlers in project
area B at an average price of G 6,000/ha (about US$48/ha), payable in equal
annual installments over individually determined repayment periods, which would
ordinarily be five years but could range up to 15 years, depending on the ca-
pacity of the prospective settler, at 8% interest. Annual export taxes on
incremental soybean and sunflower products will amount to about US$0.2 million.
However, annual Government expenditure at the end of the disbursement period
will increase by US$0.7 million to provide for additional road maintenance,
salaries and operating (vehicles, health systems, and administration) costs
due to the project (Annex 7).
Marketing and Prices
4.02      In general, the market for agricultural commodities in Paraguay is
free of controls and Government constraints. There is little evidence of mono-
polistic practices, and prices fluctuate according to natural market forces of
supply and demand. Markets in Argentina and Brazil strongly influence
those in Paraguay. As a result, domestic prices tend to follow world market
trends.
4.03      Farmers in Paraguay sell their produce mainly to intermediary buyers
and, to a lesser extent, to cooperatives and Government agencies. In the
project areas, produce is sold primarily to merchants or truckers who come to
the farm to buy directly from the producers. Most of the production is sold
at harvest time as the farmer needs the money and has little or no storage
capacity. Occasionally, farmers who have excess storage buy from neighbors.
Also, a few local merchants give merchandise in kind for crops such as soy-
beans, sunflower, beans, peanuts or tung. The merchant and the farmer then
arrange for transportation to Encarnacion when they have enough for a load, or
sell to higher volume merchants who come to the area.
4.04      Paraguay does not have a commodity purchase program, but Government,
nevertheless, establishes minimum prices for sugarcane, wheat, and soybeans
delivered to the mill. In some years, the Government has also resorted to
export quotas, which, except for beef, are inoperative because of the pre-
valence of an illegal border trade. M4arketing conditions in project areas A
and B differ considerably because of the proximity of area A, and the remote-
ness of area B, to Encarnacion, the principal trade center for the region. In
addition, area A is adjacent to an all-weather road, while the southern end
of area B has 60 to 100 km of dirt roads that are impassable in wet weather.
As a result, farmgate prices for grains received by producers in the southern
part of area B are US$15 to US$17.50/ton lower than in area A. As the middle
and northern parts of area B do not have any road access to Encarnacion, the
farraers must send their products by boat, which requires considerable handling
and, again, reduced revenues (Annex 9).

Producer Benefits
4.05      Producers benefiting from the project at full development fall into
two main categories:
(a) about 3,600 farmers would benefit directly from the credit
program; and
(b) in addition, many other farmers, including new settlers, in
area B would also benefit from the road construction and
improvement program.
4.06      A summary of benefits received by recipients of supervised credit
is as follows:
20-ha Crop Farm      40-ha Mechanized
with 4.8 ha          Crop Farm with
Partly Cleared,      8 ha Fully Cleared,
Remainder Heavy      6 ha with Stumps,
Forest               Remainder Heavy Forest
------- -($---------(US$)-
Investment costs                          3,084                   10,006
Net income without project /1               258                    1,794
Net income at full development            1,313                    3,873
Debt service                                513                    1,540
Net income after debt service               800                    2,333
/1   Poverty income level, US$1,166/farm family, averaging 6.2 members.
4.07      It is estimated that the financial rates of return from the on-farm
investments proposed (29% for farm model I, and 19% for farm model II) will be
sufficiently attractive to provide an adequate incentive to the settlers under
the project to undertake such investments and borrow for the purpose (Annex 6).
V. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
5.01      The proposed project would be of major benefit to Paraguay as it
would increase production of both cash and subsistence crops in a fertile
region and open up virgin lands for settlement through the construction and
improvement of feeder roads. The total beneficiaries from the project are
estimated at about 12,000 families (about 60,000 people) comprising:
(a) 3,600 farm families participating in the credit program (para. 4.05); and
(b) some 8,400 families in area B (of which 2,400 are non-farm, and 4,000 are
new settlers) that would benefit from the new and improved roads and socialI-
infrastructure. About 95% of the project beneficiaries currently live, or are
expected to settle, in project area B. The average investment cost would be
about US$2,200 per family, excluding credit.



- 24
5.02      The project would contribute significantly to institution building.
It would strengthen BNF as a farm credit institution and improve profitability
of its agricultural department; CNPS would be broadened as an interministerial
planning and coordinating agency in rural development through its participa-
tion in the Bank's First Rural Development Project and the proposed Second
Project; and MAG would be able to divert more resources to its experimental,
research and extension effort in Itapua Department as farmers press for new
technology and improved crop varieties. The region's land tenure situation
should also improve as IBR resolves its problems of titling existing settlers
as well as the relatively large population of farm "squatters" under the
project, with resultant benefits to other farmers in the Department.
Project Risk
5.03      Whether the project timetable will be met depends on the coordination
effort of the implementing agencies and settler response. As past experience
is encouraging on both counts, there appear to be no particular project risks
beyond those ordinarily associated with such a program of land settlement and
development. Another difficulty affecting project implementation might arise
if BNF's institution building efforts do not fully restore the institution's
financial viability. In the past, BNF, despite chronic financial problems,
has demonstrated its ability to execute externally financed projects in a
satisfactory manner.
Impact on Environment
5.04      The supervised credit component of the project is not expected to
have any long-term adverse environmental effects. While land erosion could
increase in the initial stage of the agricultural development program, as
forest is converted to crops, preventive measures would be taken to keep it
to a minimum, such as not removing forest cover from land near water courses
nor from sloping land and encouraging farmers to retain woodlots on their
farms to supply firewood and construction material and to replace cut trees.
Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations. Project technicians
would oversee this aspect of the project during farm plan preparation, when
they would also ensure the proper use of chemicals, such as pesticides or
herbicides, in the farming system.
Economic Rate of Return
5.05      The overall economic rate of return for the project, including both
areas A and B, is estimated at 14%. The economic rates of return for the
investment components, including the proportionate costs of proposed infra-
structure in each case, are as follows: small farm credit, 28X area A and 19%
area B; medium and large farm credit, 24% area A and 19% area B; overall sub-
project, 26% area A and 14% area B. Sensitivity analysis shows that should
crop yields be lower than expected or produce prices decrease to cause a 10%
decline in benefits, the overall economic rate of return would be 10%. Should
investment costs increa e by 10%, the rate would again be reduced to 10%
(Annex 10).

VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government
that:
(a) only farmers who could utilize a tractor on a minimum of 40 ha
a year would be eligible to purchase such equipment (para 3.05);
(b) health facilities would be maintained after the three-year
disbursement period of the project (para 3.07);
(c) an internationally recruited farm management adviser would be
appointed for the project by August 31, 1977, and MAG, BNF and
IBR would appoint 14 technicians each during loan disbursement
and these additional positions, except that of the farm manage-
ment adviser, would be absorbed by the Government after the
disbursement period of the project (para 3.11);
(d) Government would bear the foreign exchange risk and make
available the loan proceeds to the Central Bank for financing
the different project components (para 3.15);
(e) procurement would be in accordance with the provisions of
paragraph 3.16;
(f) a Deputy Project Coordinator would be appointed, not later
than August 31, 1977 with Bank approval and that project roads,
buildings, and equipment would be adequately maintained after
the project's completion (para 3.18);
(g) BNF would establish a new office in Capitan Meza, area B, at
the project's outset and open one or two more offices in the
area as work expands, according to BNF policy (para 3.21);
(h) BNF would make subloans on the terms and conditions set out
in paragraph 3.22;
(i) BNF would implement the agreed rehabilitation plan, and
maintain a debt-equity ratio not to exceed 8:1, as speci-
fied in paragraphs 3.24 and 3.26;
(j) IBR would grant 440 titles to farmers in area B by November 30,
1977 (para 3.27);
(k) IBR would grant "certificates of intent to issue titles" for
periods of up to six months to farmers upon payment of 10%
of the value of their land purchase (para 3.27);



- 26 -
(1) project accounts would be established by CB, BNF, CNPS,
MAG, MOPC, and MSPBS at the project's outset, and the
accounts would be audited according to the provisions of
paragraph 3.32; and
(m)  project technicians would ensure that adverse environmental
effects would be avoided by the application of sound manage-
ment practices (para 5.04).
6.02      Conditions of loan effectiveness are that:
(a) A subsidiary loan agreement has been entered into by government
with the CB and BNF (para 3.15);
(b) BNF shall have adopted a manual for debt collection and that
the measures required to carry out the debt recovery plan are
being taken (para 3.25); and
(c) BNF has received the capital contribution of G 1,300 million
referred to in paragraph 3.26.
6.03      With the above conditions and assurances, the proposed project is
suitable for a Bank loan of US$22 million to Paraguay for a period of 17 years,
including 3.5 years of grace.

SECOND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Agricultural Background
A. General
The Role of Agriculture in the Economy
1.        Agricultural production, including livestock and forestry, consti-
tutes the most important activity of the Paraguayan economy. In 1975 it
accounted for more than a third (34.1%) of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
(1972 prices) and provided employment for about 50% of the labor force. It
was also the main source of foreign exchange earnings, accounting for about
US$170.9 million, or 97% of export value (including wood and processed pro-
ducts) in 1975 (Table 1). About two-thirds of these exports consist of
semiprocessed agricultural commodities.
2.        From 1969 to 1974, the agriculture sector grew at 6% per annum but
during 1975, the rate dropped to 3.9% due to unfavorable weather conditions
and lower prices for some commodities. Following is a summary of the growth
rates attained by the sector and each subsector:
1964-74        1964-69        1969-74        1975
Crops                            4.8            1.9            7.5           3.1

Source: Central Bank Statistical Bulletins 1964-1975.
3.        Crop production accounts for the major portion of GDP in agriculture
(53% in 1975). During the last five years, the expanding share of crop pro-
duction, mainly soybean production, has been accompanied by a decline in the
share of livestock (from 38% in 1969 to 35% in 1975) as the better lands are
being shifted from livestock to crop production. This trend should continue
in the future, although, in absolute terms, both activities can be expected
to increase significantly.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
Climate and Soils
4.        Paraguay has no well-defined topgraphic barriers and is thus open
to currents of cold air from the south and warm air from the north. Its
climate, described as continental subtropical, is characterized by sharp
contrasts in temperatures and precipitation. Annual temperatures may
fluctuate from 400C in the summer to around 0C in the winter. Mean annual
temperature varies from 21 C on the southern border to about 260C in the
north. Annual rainfall varies from 1,700 mm near the Parana River in the east
to 500 mm near the Bolivian border. The country can be divided into two major
regions: the Chaco and Eastern. The Chaco region, a land area of 24.7 million
ha west of the Paraguay River, is virtually flat, sloping southward at a grade
of less than 1%. Rainfall, averaging some 750 mm annually, is seasonally
variable, thus making the region subject to periodic drought. Occasional
flooding also occurs, however, as the Chaco's rivers swell with melting snow
from the Andean highlands. Fresh water supplies are limited and saline ground-
water limits the use of its relatively fertile land. Eastern Paraguay, com-
prising about 40% (16 million ha) of the country, is a region of plains, broad
valleys and low plateaus. Its local relief seldom exceeds 100 feet, and the
highest peak rises to 2,300 feet above sea level. Rainfall averages 1,500 mm
annually and is generally well distributed throughout the year. The most
fertile soils are concentrated in the Itapua and Alto Parana Department of the
Eastern region. The Itapua subregion embraces an area of about 1.5 million ha,
of which about two-thirds are suitable for intensive land use. The Alto Parana
subregion has an area of about 5.1 million ha. Soils there are considered
among the best in the country, but it is sparsely populated and not yet
developed.
Land Use
5.        About a fifth (8 million ha) of Paraguay's land area is suitable for
crop production and surveys indicate that the area presently under cultivation
with annual and tree crops could be expanded eightfold, provided certain
improvements are made. Much of the land now classified as forest (24 million
ha) retains little commercially exploitable high forest, while the larger
part--mostly in the Chaco--contains mainly scrub forest of insignificant
commercial value. An additional 5 million ha could be brought into production
by clearing bush and planting pastures for livestock production. The fol-
lowing table gives details of land use:

Land Distribution and Tenure
6.        More equitable distribution of productive land in Paraguay has been
achieved primarily through colonization of Government-owned land, and in some
cases, of privately owned land. The Institute of Rural Welfare (IBR) has
concentrated on settling the largest possible number of people on hitherto
unutilized state lands. This approach, however, has caused the settlers con-
siderable hardships as the settlement of large numbers of new farmers in
relatively inaccessible areas without sufficient preparation, financial
support or technical assistance has led to the proliferation of subsistence
farming. In the 12 years since its inception, IBR has colonized three times
more land than had been settled in the previous half century and its programs
have benefited about 3,000 families per year (Table 2). On the basis of an
average family size of six persons, it is estimated that over 21% of all
Paraguayans now live in official Government colonies. This effort has helped
ease the pressure on land even though distribution of land holdings is still
skewed, as shown below. While improvements could be made in land apportion-
ments in the private sector through expropriation, particularly in Eastern
Paraguay, analysis reveals that most of the large holdings are situated in
the Chaco region and in the less productive or undeveloped area of Eastern
Paraguay. These holdings are devoted to extensive livestock ranching or
forestry and do not necessarily represent a misallocation of land resources
under present conditions.

B. Agricultural Production
Crops
8.        Crop production is presently concentrated in the Central subregion.
This area accounts for about half of the total output of the most important
crops: cassava, soybean, corn, cotton, tobacco, oranges, sugarcane, castor



ANNEX 1
Page 5
seed, and coffee. Other important producing subregions are Itapua, Concepcion-
San Pedro, and Alto Parana, which, together, account for about 40% of total
crop production (Tables 2 and 3). Development projects programmed for the
Concepcion-San Pedro region, such as improvement of the Coronel-Oviedo-Ybu Yau
road and establishment of a sugar mill, are likely to have an important impact
on growth prospects there, while production in the Chaco region is not likely
to increase significantly during the next five years as its potential lies
mainly in extensive livestock production, at least, during the medium term.
Farming Systems
9.        There are three main systems of farming in Paraguay, recognizable
by the type of farm power involved: (a) subsistence or traditional farming,
which depends solely on manual family labor; (b) the more progressive tradi-
tional, or small-scale commercial farming, which uses draft animals; and
(c) commercial farming, primarily found in and around the Japanese, German
and Mennonite settlements, where tractors are the predominant source of farm
power. Current crop production from these farming systems, in terms of
hectares harvested annually, are as follows:
1975
('000 ha)
1.  Maize                       222.6
2.  Soybean                     150.2
3.  Cotton                      100.0
4.  Cassava                      96.5
5.  Beans                        63.4
6.  Wheat                        25.2
Total      657.9
10.       The subsistence, or small traditional farms using only manual labor,
derive over half their production from the three subsistence crops--maize,
cassava and beans. The farms with draft animals, because they have more
hectares in cash crops, plant about 30% of their farm in the three subsistence
crops. The tractor-powered farms produce little or no subsistence crops, con-
centrating on double cropping of wheat with soybean, or single cropping cotton.
In and around the larger towns, vegetables generate a large part of the small
cultivators' cash income. A new crop to Paraguay is sunflower, which shows
a marked increase in the Department of Itapua because it can be double cropped
with soybean, producing income in January before other crops are harvested.
Inputs
11.       The use of fertilizers and insecticides remains below recommended
levels but there has been a steady increase over recent years. Chemical
fertilizer is used by less than 10% of Paraguayan farmers, partly because of



ANNEX 1
Page 6
the high cost of importing it into the country. Fertilizer imports increased
from an annual average of 1,100 m tons during 1963-67, to 7,080 m tons during
1970-74. Since then, fertilizer use has declined due to high prices. Fertil-
izer is imported in bags (mostly from Brazil) and, until recently was distri-
buted through Government channels. The Government is now phasing out its role
as input distributor and it is hoped that increased competition may lower
retail prices as the private sector becomes more active. The main fertilizers
are phosphates, used principally on pasture, and nitrogen fertilizers, used
mainly on crops.
12.       Production and importation of seed and planting materials is
currently the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock
(UAG), and, while there have been no *Jor shortages of these inputs, quality
control problems have arisen. The Nat'tpnal Seed Service, currently dealing
with maize, soya, cotton and wheat, is also responsible for the importation
and marketing of recommended vegetabl'e-and potato varieties. Its staff is
limited, consisting of about two professionals and three technicians. Five
inspectors are responsible for advising on all aspects of production.
The Role of Small Farms in Crop Production
13.       Small farmers in Paraguay produce a wide array of crops and account
for over two-thirds of the country's production of cotton, peas, sweet potatoes,
cassava, peanuts, soybeans and tobacco. They also produce about half of the
annual production of sugarcane, onions, lima beans, corn and potatoes. Three
of the major Government commodity programs involve soybeans, cotton, and
tobacco, which are the crops that offer the greatest potential for improving
small farmers' income. The National Soya Program was designed to increase the
area planted by 100% during a three-year period (from 73,000 ha in 1972 to
146,000 ha in 1974) and targets were nearly met in 1973, when the area
harvested reached 140,000 ha. Considerable success has also been achieved
in implementing the cotton and tobacco programs. The area planted with cotton
more than doubled over a three-year period (33,000 in 1971 to 81,000 ha in
1974), while the area planted with tobacco increased by 50% over the same
period. These three crops accounted for nearly 29% of commodity export
receipts in 1975, and it can be expected that they will continue to play a
key role in the future.
Main Export Crops
14.       While soybean production has expanded rapidly during the last few
years, further growth will be closely linked to increases in drying capacity.
Drying capacity is presently insufficient and large losses occur at harvest
time in years when the humidity is high. Soybean prices and exports are
regulated by MAG, which encourages local processing and sets minimum prices.
These prices are not effective, however, because producer prices are set by
market forces in the absence of a Government purchasing program, and because
of illegal trade across the country's borders.



ANNEX 1
Page 7
15.       Cotton production in Paraguay is characterized by low yields and
excess processing capacity. Production consists mostly of short fiber varie-
ties grown by small farmers in the Departments of Paraguari, Caaguazu,
Concepcion and Missiones. At present, part of the total production is pro-
cessed by 11 cotton gins with a total capacity of 300,000 tons, about 200,000
tons in excess of the current level of production. There is also a modern
multi-purpose textile plant in Pilar, considered among the best in the Latin
American Free Trade Association. This plant, however, also operates below
capacity. Cotton is exported as lint and marketed in Uruguay, the UK, France,
Federal Republic of Germany, and Japan.
16.       Although tobacco production has experienced a favorable growth rate
over recent years (12% in 1973/74), further expansion is dependent on increased
external demand, which, in turn, will depend on Paraguay's ability to improve
quality, particularly curing and classification methods. Investments in
curing facilities at the farm level appear to be absolutely essential.
17.       Sugar could become one of Paraguay's major export products.  Foreign
investors are considering two modern sugar mills north of Asuncion, which
would double the current level of production.  At present, most of Paraguay s
sugarcane is grown in the Departments of Guaira, Presidente Hayes and Paraguari.
Mlost of the existing mills are obsolete and their production costs are high.
In addition, production is fragmented and farm units are small.
Main Crops for Domestic Consumption
18.       Cassava, one of the main domestic crops, is grown as a staple all
over the country and has good export prospects as chips and flour. Production
was close to 900,000 m tons in 1975.
19.       Corn is the second most important domestic crop after cassava.
Although most of the production is consumed internally, some is exported to
Brazil and Argentina. Output of grain reached 338,000 m tons in 1975.
20.       Paraguay is self-sufficient in rice production and some exports may
be possible to neighboring countries. In 1975, about 50,000 tons were pro-
duced, of which over 80% was grown as irrigated rice and the remainder, dry-
land rice. Most of the rice produced is medium-grain but farmers are experi-
menting with long-grain varieties. Dryland rice can be grown as a summer crop
in rotation with wheat.
21.       Sorghum production for domestic consumption, mainly in the livestock
subsector, could be increased significantly. Sorghum is drought-resistant and
grows well in areas where summer rainfall is limited. It also has the advan-
tage of being less demanding in terms of soil fertility. The Upper Chaco sub-
region appears to have the best conditions for increasing the production of
this crop. At present, only 6,000 tons are being produced.



ANNEX 1
Page 8
22.       Paraguay continues to be dependent on imported wheat despite Govern-
ment efforts to boost production. In 1967, the Government formulated a wheat
program that called for a rapid expansion in the area planted by introducing
large-scale mechanized farming methods, modern inputs, and basic on-farm
infrastructure. The main vehicle was a credit program administered by the
Agricultural Department of the National Development Bank (BNF) and funded by
the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) (19% of the
cost), suppliers' credit (19%) and local resources, particularly those from
the Central Bank (about 40%) and BNF (22%). The program was initially success-
ful but problems soon developed. BNF's appraisal of sub-loan applications was
minimal and wheat often was planted on unsuitable land. There was consider-
able over-investment in machinery and, reportedly, misapplication of resources.
Bad weather in 1967 and 1969 caused serious financial losses to growers and,
in 1972, there were serious losses from a blight infection. The net result
of the accumulated losses was an overall financial crisis for wheat growers
and BNF. The latter failed to properly assess the viability of each borrower
and as a result granted loans with unreasonably short repayment periods and
with inadequate collateral. This, in part, reflected the structure of the
original program's financial plan, which was based on relatively short-term
loans. While by itself the program was not successful, it encouraged the
planting of soybeans as a summer rotation crop to spread machinery costs and
reduce the risk associated with monoculture. Soybean production was more
successful than wheat production and has increased rapidly since. Present
limitations are the unavailability of seed from high-yielding varieties
adapted to Paraguay's environment and the sparse use of fertilizer and lime.
Livestock Production
23.       Paraguay's ecology, its ample supply of land, and the relatively
favorable long-term market prospects for beef indicate that the livestock
subsector will continue to play an important role in the nation's economy.
In 1975, livestock production accounted for about 12.2% of GDP and about
one-fifth of Paraguay's exports. It employed about 5.5% of the labor force
and utilized about 37% of the country's land area. In addition, it accounted
for about 82% of the country's capital stock in the agricultural sector.
Grazing land for cattle production comprises an area of about 14.3 million
ha, of which 40% is in the Eastern region, and 60% in the Chaco. With a
cattle population of 2.9 million head in the Eastern region and 2.0 million
head in the Chaco, the average density in each region is estimated to be about
2 ha per head and 4.3 ha per head, respectively. The grazing density for the
country as a whole is estimated at 2.9 ha per head. Potentially, this could
be reduced to 2 ha per head, thus permitting a 45% increase in the national
herd without danger of overgrazing existing pastures. The adoption of improved
practices such as fencing, pasture improvement, pasture rotation, supplemental
winter feeding and breeding is an important requirement for increasing the
size of the herd. The Bank Group has financed four livestock projects in
Paraguay since 1963. In the first two projects, emphasis was laid on finan-
cing basic farm infrastructure; pasture improvement was emphasized in the



ANNEX 1
Page 9
third project. The fourth project, currently being implemented, piaces
greater emphasis on small farmers and cooperatives and on improvement of
breeding stock.
Forestry
24.       Continued commercial exploitation of Paraguay's forest is feasible,
particularly in the area east of Coronel Oviedo, classified as high forest
(Bosques Altos). Paraguay has about 21.1 million ha (54% of the total land
area) of forest classified as temperature-warm-humid located in the Eastern
region between the Paraguay and Parana Rivers. An inventory of Paraguay's
forest resources carried out by FAO between 1967 and 1972 showed that more
than 50% of the forest area in Paraguay contains commercially valuable timber.
In the area surveyed, there were more than 105 million m of wood with some
commercial value. Most of these areas were privately owned (absut 80%). The
FAO survey also showed that the f rest area contains about 16 m per ha (in
log equivalent) and about 75 young trees per ha of exportable types of wood.
25.       The survey pointed out the need for improving the management of the
country's forest resources, which are not being efficiently exploited. The
annual rate of extraction of valuable species exceeds the process of natural
growth and regeneration and the existence of a large number of small 3opera-
tions contributes to the accelerated rate of extraction (about 1.4 m log
equivalent) per year. However, the Government is initiating studies to im-
prove the nation's forestry industries. There will be scope for forestry
investment in Itapua Department, similar to that occurring on the Argentine
side of the Parana River.
C. Marketing and Prices
Marketing
26.       Prices for agricultural commodities in Paraguay are determined
largely by competitive bidding. The market is influenced by supply and
demand conditions from other countries, particularly Argentina and Brazil.
As a result, domestic prices follow closely the movements of world market
prices.
27.       Paraguay does not have a commodity purchase program, but the Govern-
ment establishes minimum prices for sugarcane, wheat, and soybeans delivered
to the mill. In the case of the first two, the minimum prices are enforced,
as it is relatively easy to control the price at the mills, but this is not
the case for soybeans. In some years, the Government has also resorted to



ANNEX 1
Page 10
export quotas, mainly for soybeans and cattle. Except for beef, however, these
are inoperative because of the prevalence of an illegal border trade.
28.       Farmers in Paraguay sell their produce mainly to intermediary
buyers and, to a lesser extent, to cooperatives and Government agencies.
Intermediary buyers, usually merchants, farmers or truckers, purchase the farm
products within their localities and frequently use secondary agents to help
them contact all producers in their area. They own available storage facil-
ities, which are generally very rudimentary, and use their own resources for
financing their operations. They are not fully engaged in marketing and
depend on other activities for their livelihood. The main problems limiting
efficiency are lack of storage capacity to meet peak requirements; low level
of technology (a major cause of losses at the storage stage); and lack of
sufficient resources to finance construction, transport equipment, and higher
volume operations.
29.       The Government's old Department of Marketing in MAG has been restruc-
tured into a Division of Marketing and Agricultural Economics, consisting of
two units--Operations and Engineering, and Standards and Marketing--and staff
has been increased from eight in 1971 to 39 and there are nine temporary
employees working as grain receivers or inspectors. The Inter-American Devel-
opment Bank (IDB) has assisted the Government through its Agricultural Devel-
opment Program, an ambitious plan for investments in marketing infrastructure,
particularly silos.
Prices
30.       Since 1968, agricultural prices have increased steadily and stimu-
lated output. During the 1971-74 period, the input/output price relationship
turned against agriculture (total input costs rose faster than prices), but
a subsequent price increase stimulated output, particularly that of export
products. Since labor accounted for about 60% of the increase in input costs,
farmers that depended on hired labor changed their operations to less labor-
intensive practices. For example, there was a rapid expansion in soybean pro-
duction, a crop with relatively low labor requirements (soybeans utilize about
34 man/days per hectare, compared with 74 for cotton, 92 for rice, and 139 for
tobacco). The rapid increase in soybean prices and its lower manpower require-
ments allowed most farmers to improve their overall incomes. The table below
summarizes the price movements of selected annual crops and beef (liveweight
basis) from 1968-1974.

D. Institutional Services
Rural Welfare
31.       IBR is an autonomous agency, established under Law 852 of 1963 to
determine and execute policy on land reform, land settlement and rural welfare
under the provisions of the Agrarian Statute and related legislation. The
President and five-member counsel of IBR are given broad authority in dealing
with these matters, even though IBR's official channel of communication is
through MAG. Since its inception, the IBR has established 250 colonies of
over 40,000 families.
32.        IBR's organization is highly centralized, with nearly 80% of its
545 permanent staff located in Asuncion. Field staff are hampered by lack
of clearly defined work assignments and proper technical and administrative
support. While most field staff are agronomists by training, their assign-
ments generally consist of debt collection, farmer group organization, and
marketing assistance projects. Lack of vehicles and proper vehicle mainte-
nance also hinders their work.
33.        Concentrating mainly on state lands entrusted to its control, IBR's
principal activities have been in land settlement. Settlers are chosen from
the more densely settled minifundia areas and from expatriate Paraguayans.



ANNEX 1
Page 12
Colonies may be for livestock, agriculture/forestry or agricultural produc-
tion, but the majority are located in the Eastern region, where the average
size of an individual farmer plot is 20 ha (Annex 2).
Technical Assistance
34.        Several Government institutions provide technical assistance to
farmers: MAG through its various commodity divisions, the Extension Service
and the Small Farmer Credit Agency (CAH); IBR; and BNF. The main responsi-
bility for providing technical assistance to farmers at the fteld level,
however, rests with the Agriculture Extension Service (SEAG). SEAG has 23
field offices distributed throughout the country, and a technical staff
of 79 which provide a countrywide coverage of about one officer per 2,500
farmers. SEAG concentrates its work on promoting export crop development,
particularly tobacco and cotton. Some demonstration plots have been estab-
lished on farmers' land and have proved effective, despite severe staff
limitations.
35.       The major factors affecting SEAG's efficiency are the low salary
level and the low level of financial resources available for operational
activities and for equipment. SEAG's personnel is relatively well qualified
and most have had some training abroad. Also, a program financed by the UNDP
has strengthened SEAG's training capability.
Research
36.       Agricultural research in Paraguay is carried out by both MAG and the
National University. The professional staff of these agencies have been
assisted by various foreign experts over the past 10 years. Work programs
are crop-oriented, primarily in terms of technical factors, such as variety
selection, correct soil preparation, correct planting distances, use of im-
proved seed, and use of fertilizer. However, work has not been accompanied
by a thorough economic and financial assessment of the recommended farming
systems' financial viability.
37.       USAID plans to assist MAG upgrade its research programs which will
benefit small farmers. The project, which will be in operation during the
period 1978-82, has the following objectives: (a) expansion of agricultural
research programs oriented toward the needs of small farmers; (b) establish-
ment of a permanent research training program within MAG: (c) expansion of the
Ministry's Planning Office to deal with economic analysis and planning of rural
development programs; and (d) creation of a funding mechanism to provide the
National Seed Service (SENASE) with resources to secure, process and distri-
bute improved seed varieties.
Agricultura1 Credit
38.       Institutional credit to the agricultural sector in Paraguay is
provided by -he banking system, controlled by the Central Bank (GB) through



ANNEX 1
Page 13
BNF and 13 commercial banks. In addition, CB provides funds for on-lending
through the Livestock Fund (FG), using IDA and IBRD funds. FG is now the
principal source of long-term credit to the livestock sub-sector, holding by
the end of 1975 a portfolio of G 3,619 million (US$28.7 million). A number
of smaller non-bank credit institutions, in particular, the state-owned Small
Farmer Credit Agency (CAH) and privately owned Paraguayan Development Company
(COMDESA), are subject to certain provisions of the General Banking Law and
to the control of CB. A reportedly substantial but unquantifiable amount of
non-institutional credit is provided by agricultural produce merchants.
39.       BNF is by far the most important source of credit to the agricul-
tural sector. In 1975, it granted loans to the crop sub-sector totalling
G 2,459 million (US$79.5 million), which represented 61% of total bank credit
extended to the sub-sector during the year, compared with 90% in 1970. BNF's
portfolio of loans outstanding to the crop sub-sector rose from G 3,518
million (US$27.9 million) at the end of 1970 to G 7,402 million (US$58.7
million) at the end of 1975. (Annex 3).
40.       The commercial banks, which are mostly affiliates of foreign banks,
have been historically reluctant to finance the crop sub-sector because
of what are considered to be unduly high risks. However, in recent years,
they have increased their lending to crop farmers substantially, primarily
as short-term credit on a highly selective basis, emphasizing large farmers
and machinery. During 1975, agriculture took 4% of the commercial banks'
total lending, while the year-end balance of loans outstanding to the crop
sub-sector, amounting to G 1,256 million (US$10.0 million), was 7.6% of the
banks' total loan portfolio.
41.       CAH is a small farmer credit agency within IAG which provides short-
term (six to eight months) subsidized credit to members of newly formed
farmers' associations at an interest rate of 9% per annum, plus a 2% commission
fee. Funds have come largely from USAID at concessional interest rates. Loan
disbursements increased from G 9.9 million (US$78,000) in 1971/72 to G 83.3
million (US$661,000) in 1975/76. MAG is interested in CAH participating in
the project, possibly as a sub-borrower from BNF, and as an on-lending agency
to groups of small farmers in the project area.
42.       COMDESA is a private development bank which finances investments in
development-oriented projects, including, where necessary, feasibility studies
and technical assistance. During the six years of its existence, COMDESA had
approved financing for 272 projects, totalling G 1,389 million (US$11.0 mil-
lion), of which 2% was for crops, 31% for livestock, and 34% for agro-
industries. About 70% of COMDESA loans are long-term (five to 10 years)
maturity, while the remainder are for medium term (two to five years). The
interest rate is about 12% per annum with a 5% one-time commission.



ANNEX 1
Page 14
43.       Although no firm data are available, it is estimated that non-
institutional credit provided by shopkeepers, input suppliers, and produce
merchants reaches some 17% of farmers, while institutional credit is granted
to only about 7%. Interest rates on non-institutional credit generally are
very high and often are hidden in the purchase of output at sub-market prices.
Cooperatives and Farmer Associations
44.       The cooperative movement has gained momentum in Paraguay, its
development promoted by foreign immigrants. Some successful cooperatives
have been established by Mennonite colonies in the Chaco, while others have
been established by German and Japanese settlers in Itapua and the central
region. Recently, the movement has spread to small farmers through the
Paraguayan Union of Cooperatives (UNIPACO), a marketing organization that
is expanding its activities with USAID assistance. Its network of local
cooperatives presently covers 21 locations in Eastern Paraguay. Mutual help
among farmers is a common practice in Paraguay, and many such groups (mingas)
exist in the Itapua area. The experience of CAH indicates that low-income
farmers will form associations initially but will drop out unless a complete
package of services (technology, inputs, technical assistance, credit, and
marketing) is provided as an inducement for their continuing participation.
45.       Since 1972, the Government's National Council for Social Progress
(CNPS) has been responsible for planning and supervising the execution of
integrated rural development programs in 23 public colonies in Paraguay's
Northeastern region, and for coordination of the various institutions involved
in the IDA-assisted First Rural Development Project. CNPS was established by
Presidential decree in 1967 as an interministerial organization in which IBR
and BNF are also represented.
E. Project-related Infrastructure
46.       The Highways Authority (DGV) within the Ministry of Public Works
and Communication (MOPC) is responsible for planning, constructing and main-
taining all national and departmental roads in the country (about 80% of the
total network). Responsibility for construction and maintenance of feeder
roads is entrusted to two other departments within MOPC (Road Authority and
Mineral Authority). Additionally, the Ministry of Defense constructs and
maintains about 1,200 km of roads in the Chaco region through its Civil Action
program. Some minor road works are also carried out by IBR and by the
Paraguayan-Brazilian Commission.



ANNEX 1
Page 15
47.       Road transport is the main mode for domestic freight and passengers,
particularly since the railway system has steadily declined over the past 20
years. A domestic air service network complements surface transport. River
transport is unimportant domestically, except for timber rafting and some
internal river shipping on the Paraguay and Parana Rivers, but it does provide
Paraguay with her vital link to the sea. About 85% of all foreign trade is
carried by this mode. The river route, however, is facing competition follow-
ing construction in the early 1960s of a bridge across the Parana River
between Paraguay and Brazil, and the recent completion of a paved road from
the Paraguayan border through Brazil to the Atlantic port of Paranagua; this
bridge and road, together, provide an alternative link to the sea.
48.       The highway network in Paraguay totals about 6,500 km, of which more
than three-quarters are earth. Road development over the past 20 years has
been concentrated on paving primary roads and on extending the system. The
network as a whole provides acceptable transport to most populated areas of
the country. However, some of the existing paved and gravel roads need to be
improved to meet growing traffic volumes and to facilitate the development of
new agricultural areas. For administrative purposes, the highway system is
classified into national or primary highways, departmental or secondary high-
ways, and local or feeder roads. There are, in addition, other special
categories such as oil development roads, and logging tracks.
Education
49.       Education in Paraguay has been improving rapidly during recent years.
However, high dropout and repetition rates are reflected in nationwide comple-
tion rates of only 26% at the primary level, and 41% at the secondary level.
These figures imply that roughly 40% of annual operating expenditures is spent
on children who fail to complete their studies within the expected period.
50.       Primary school enrollment has increased at the rate of 2.8% per
year over the past 10 years, which is slightly higher than the 2.6% rate of
population growth. In 1974, about 82% (360,000) of the seven-to-12-year-old-
age group was enrolled in primary schools. The opportunity for a full six
grade primary education in rural areas is limited. About 75% of the students
remain in the first three grades; only a few (36%) entering grade 1 reach
grade 4 (the minimum literacy level); and only 17 out of 100 complete grade 6.
There is no lack of motivation to attend school on the part of either parents
or children, but there is a lack of rural schools which offer complete pri-
mary education, relevant curriculum, and basic teaching and learning materials.
Moreover, rural teachers need upgrading. Although the majority of teachers
(70%) have teaching certificates, they have not been trained to work in a
rural environment. These teachers have proved to be inadequate when it comes
to dealing with bright rural children who have broad experience in agriculture
but limited familiarity with urban life. Rural teachers are also largely
unsupervised and only by chance are they informed of new educational trends.

51.       Secondary school enrollment has increased by 8.3% per year during
the past 10 years but the increase has benefitted mainly urban children. In
1974 total secondary enrollment was about 72,000, or 19% of the 13-to-18-year-
old-age group, and some 46% of these live in Asuncion. The Bank Group has
made two loans to the education sector and a third loan is under considera-
tion. The first education project (Credit No. 347-PA) was designed to assist
the Government in developing a more effective system of secondary and voca-
tional education, while the second (Loan No. 1252-PA) aimed at meeting
Paraguay's need for nonformal vocational training. A proposed third educa-
tion project, partially financed by the Bank, would help develop the Govern-
ment's nuclear school system, which consists of well-equipped community
centers surrounded by associated schools, innovative curriculum, upgrading
of teachers, provision of teaching materials and the establishment of a more
effective, decentralized system of supervision. At the secondary level, the
structure and content of education is also being reformed through the first
education project. The multilateral schools concept is being introduced
to offer practical options at the lower secondary level and technical courses
at the higher level.
Health
52.       The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare has prepared a National
Health Plan for the next five years (1976-1980) in accordance with the objec-
tives of the National Development Policy for 1976-80. The general objectives
of the Plan are: (a) to increase life expectancy by three or four years; (b)
to extend health services coverage, particularly in rural areas; and (c) to
contribute to national economic and social development by incorporating
the Health Plan into the National Development Plan.
53.       These health priorities related to the rural area have been the
basis for launching a Rural Health Program to provide personal and environ-
mental health services to localities up to 2,000 population and to scattered
rural inhabitants. The Rural Health Program involves activities in (a) com-
municable disease control, (b) maternal and child health care, (c) first aid
and patient referrals, and (d) basic environmental sanitation promotion.
However, little progress has been made in developing an effective methodology
for program implementation.
54.       As for health manpower plans for rural areas, there is a strong
emphasis in training "auxiliary rural obstetricians" by the National Train-
ing Center for Auxiliary Nurses (CENFAE). This Center will devote all its
resources to training personnel exclusively for rural areas during the five-
year plan. On the other hand, there is a proposed Government bill providing
compulsory rural service by graduating health professionals and para-
professionals. There is a good chance that this bill will be passed during
1977/78.

55.       The improvement of rural health infrastructure has been included as
part of the five-year Rural Health Program, with a total of 112 new rural
health posts and 20 new health centers proposed. Finance for improving the
rural health infrastructure is being sought from: (a) internal sources,
which have not been clearly defined in terms of amount, sectoral participation
or community participation; and (b) from the IDB and the Bank, through loans
for construction, remodelling, and equipping health facilities.
F. The Role of International Agencies
56.       Paraguay has made extensive use of the international credit agencies
in its agricultural development programs. The principal lender has been the
Bank Group, which has made 18 loans to Paraguay, including 10 from IBRD and
eight IDA credits, amounting to US$103.8 million (US$58.3 million, IBRD,
US$45.5 million, IDA) in support of livestock and rural development (50%),
transport (30%), education (10%), and preinvestment studies (4%).
57.       IDB made a loan of US$14.8 million to Paraguay in 1971 for a four-
part rural development project. The loan, now 88% disbursed, includes finance
for agricultural credit, technical assistance, marketing and silos, and rural
education. A second-stage silo project has been prepared and may be approved
early in 1977. Also, a second-stage loan of US$5.3 million to the National
Service for the Prevention of Foot and Mouth Disease (SENALFA) was recently
signed. This project will help to expand the country's foot and mouth disease
control program on a national scale. Further loans to SENALFA are expected
in the future and will include improvement and expansion of programs to con-
trol rabies and brucellosis. IDB is currently providing technical assistance
(US$480,000) to CAH for administrative reorganization and also for preparation
of projects in agricultural credit, reforestation, and land clearing. Two
technical assistance grants have also been made to Paraguay for consolidation
of public colonies (US$256,000) and improvement of rural health services
(US$135,000) in Alta Parana. A third technical assistance grant of US$461,000
is being considered for this area to study feasibility of rural road improve-
ment. Technical assistance is also being provided to assist in the identifica-
tion of rural development projects along the Chaco road.
58.       USAID made loans amounting to US$6.9 million to Paraguay during
1975/76 for agricultural development. In addition, grants to the agricultural
sector during this period amounted to US$3.1 million. Loans and grants during
both years were for improved food production and nutrition, including projects
for rural agro-industry, support to small farmer credit unions and coopera-
tives, and feeder road improvement. AID's proposed program for 1977 includes
US$4.7 million in loans and US$1.4 million in grants, largely for continuation
and expansion of the food and nutrition projects. An important component of
this program is the implementation of an agricultural research project directed
specifically to the needs of small farmers.

PARAGUAY
SECOND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Land Demarcation and Titling
Background
1.        In the late 1800s, the Government of Paraguay entered into the sale
of public lands to foreign investors to replenish the national treasury, which
had been depleted by the war of the Triple Alliance. At that time, large
tracts of land in Itapua and elsewhere were transferred to foreign investors
(mostly Argentines), who began exploitation of the areas' vast forestry and
yerbamate resources. While initial land payments were made by these in-
vestors, there is serious doubt that the properties were ever paid off in
full. Nevertheless, their ownership of land was recognized once they had
controlled the properties for 30 years.
2.        There are no remaining latifundias within project area A, (see
Annex 5 for definition of project areas) but five large land owners still own
approximately 200,000 ha in project area B. However, the Institute of Rural
Welfare (IBR) was recently authorized to take over this land under the terms
of Decree Law 25542, signed on September 17, 1976. Private lands which are
"rationally exploited" are exempt.
3.        Settlement of Itapua for farming purposes is a result of Government
policy that encouraged colonization by foreign emigrants and of the steady
influx of colonists from other areas of Paraguay, particularly the crowded
minifundia areas to the east and south of Asuncion (Table 1). Colonists have
acquired land by (a) entering official Government colonization areas, (b) pur-
chasing land directly from large land owners, and (c) settling as squatters
on private or Government lands.
4.        European immigrants settled the southern part of Itapua over 40 years
ago and all of the presently available land has been subdivided. The two
colonies comprising project area A, Unificadas and Federico Chavez, were
established in 1940 and 1950, respectively. The area is subdivided into farms
averaging 22.2 ha and only one-fifth remains under forest. In the land tenure
structure of this zone, ownership is claimed by about half the,farmers,
one-third indicate that they have official occupancy authorization, and the
remainder are squatters.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
5.        In project area B, settlement was initiated in the 1960s.  Ini-
tially, new farmers settled around the small villages along the Parana River
and from there settlement continued inland along logging tracks. Farms are
currently being established in the southern portion up to 40 km away from the
Parana. With the construction of the road, Pirapo-Capitan Meza, the southern
part of the zone up to the Rio Tembey became accessible by land, thus accelerat-
ing settlement; a primitive infrastructure is now being developed, such as im-
provement of a rudimentary road network (logging tracks) and the establishment
of some inland service centers and schools.
6.        With completion of the road to Capitan Meza, land sales - under the
name "private colonies" - took place. These sales have come to a virtual
standstill, however, as the authorities recognized the unwillingness of the
latifundia to comply with legal stipulations for the establishment of private
colonies and proceeded to authorize squatters to occupy the land. Even so,
this situation is not a major block to development of the region, since the
agrarian legislation of Paraguay protects the rights of squatters on private
land which are not "rationally exploited". 1/ IBR intends to issue titles to
squatters so that their applications for credit can be processed by the National
Development Bank (BNF) in the usual way.
Farm Size Distribution
7.        In both project areas, farm size is fairly evenly distributed as
indicated by the following table:
PROJECT AREA A                            PROJECT AREA B
Farm Size    No. of               Area                No. of                Area

10 - 20     1,550      40.9    23.2       29.2       3,163      62.5     47.4    43.1
Over 20      1,120     29.5    51.7       65.0       1,119      22.1      59.9    54.4
No reply       200       5.3      -         -          221       4.4        -       -
Total     3,790    100.0    79.5    100.0          5,062    100.0    110.1   100.0
Average farm size in project area A is 22.2 ha and in project area B 22.7 ha.
In the older part of area A, however, almost a quarter of all farms are under
10 ha, which is the result of subdivision of the original 20-ha homesteads,
either through inheritance or sale. If this continues, the area might soon be
affected by minifundia problems. In project area B, almost 75% of the 5,000
1/   Law No. 854, Chapter XVI (Article 135).



ANNEX 2
Page 3
farmers are squatters. In IBR colonies, only about 4% are owners, and, on
private lands, 17% of the settlers ciaim ownership. The relatively high
proportion of owners in project area A means that a farm development scheme
can be rapidly developed and credit can be initiated soon after project
approval. In project area B, a program of land regularization and titling
would be a prerequisite to successful project implementation.
Settlement Pattern
8.        Land available in project area B totals 240,000 ha, about 75%
(180,000 ha) of which can be used for farming purposes. The remaining
60,000 ha consist mainly of soils subject to periodic flooding or areas where
high water table conditions make intensive cropping a risky operation.
Settlers are arriving in the more accessible areas of project area B, south of
the Tembey, at a rapid pace, and already some 83,000 ha, or 83% of arable
land, in this area have been settled. It is estimated that, even without
further road improvment or provision of services, the remaining 18,000 ha of
arable land in the area will be occupied by incoming settlers by the end of
1977. However, little settlement is expected north of the river until a bridge
is constructed. The settlement pattern in project area B may be summarized as
follows:
Land
Available
Land Already         for
Area        Farm Land /1        Settled          Settlement
('000 ha)      ('000 ha)          ('000 ha)          ('000 ha)

Central and
Northeast          105.0          78.7                26.5              52.6
240.0         180.0              110.1               70.2
/1   Including both lands presently cultivated and forest land that could be
farmed if cleared.
IBR Titling Operations
9.        Normally, IBR issues only definite titles, constituting a legal
transfer of the land to the name of the settler, when the purchase price is
paid in full. Since 1973, however, IBR has authorized the issue of titles
to settlers in colonies in the Eje Norte zone who fulfilled the following
conditions:
(a) Cultivate a minimum of 3 ha;



ANNEX 2
Page 4
(b) Paid to IBR at least 25% of the purchase price of their
land;
(c) Do not own more than 25 ha;
(d) Have satisfactory production records; and
(e) Enter into a separate agreement with IBR to repay the out-
standing balance of the purchase price of their land.
10.       There are other requirements for granting of titles, which, on some
occasions, have been imposed on settlers by IBR but which are not usually
enforced. For example, a settler must clear at least 20% of his holding
within three years. Also, he must construct a house and build a fence around
the cultivated area. The maximum period allowed for payment of land is 15
years, but, in practice, shorter periods are prescribed, usually seven years,
including a two-year grace period. Penalties for payment default are reva-
luation of the outstanding balance at current land prices and foreclosure in
the event of more than two consecutive payments being in arrears, but these
sanctions are also seldom applied.
11.       A modification of IBR rules was made under the first Rural Develop-
ment Project wherein farmers were granted titles, or certificates of intent
to issue titles, on payment of as little as 10% of the land value. The
certificate system was devised as a sort of short-term title substitute to
comply with BNF requirements for extending credit to producers, while their
actual titles were being processed by IBR, a process which could take several
months.
Titling Under the Project
12.       IBR's role under the project would be to carry out a land demar-
cating and titling program of sufficient magnitude to assure a solid base of
titled land holders within the project area who could then qualify for on-farm
credit. During the first year of project execution, one IBR field supervisor
and seven technicians would be assigned to project area B to concentrate on
land regularization and titling among already established settlers in the area
south of the Tembey. As bridge and road construction opens up new lands for
settlement north of the river, seven more technicians would be added in year 2
and in year 3 to work with incoming settlers. Some 4,400 farmers in the area
do not have titles now and the figure is expected to rise to 7,600 by 1980.
13.       Since credit cannot be granted unless farmers have titles or certi-
ficates of intent, IBR must begin work in 1977 in order to process a suffi-
cient number to assure successful project implementation. It is expected that
some 440 farmers in project area B would receive credit under the project
during 1978, 1,200 during 1979, and 1,350 during 1980. To ensure sufficient
eligible participants, at least 440 titles should have been issued by the date



ANNEX 2
Page 5
the end of November 1977, in readiness for the next crap season.  Additionally,
in a frontier area such as project area B, the IBR would be encouraged to grant
titles or certificates to settlers who have paid only 10% of purchase price of
their land to avoid delay of credit badly needed to boost production and
inc omes.
14.       The size of the farm granted to incoming settlers has averaged
about 22 ha in the project area (para 7), but under the proposed project,
lot size could be increased to as much as 50 ha under the condition of a
recent IBR ruling. In no case, however, would they be under 20 ha. Lots
somewhat larger than 22 ha might enable farmers to retain a larger forest
reserve on their properties in the medium term and provide a more economically
viable unit for possible mechanization. On the other hand, it would be social-
ly undesirable to reduce the total number of farmers receiving land, and the
larger land size would, of course, increase the purchase price of land to those
who receive it. Also, while agricultural production from larger farms might be
higher in the long run, this volume would initially    be smaller than withi
smaller farms that would accommodate more families and thus provide more labor
for land clearing and cultivation. IBR has not yet decided what the actual lot
size would be under the proposed project, but in view of the increasing emphasis
on mechanization within the area and the fact that physiography should be taken
fully into account when demarcating lots, lot size should be determined on a
realistic basis, subject to considerations of production as well as equitable
distribution.
15.       In addition to granting titles under the project, IBR would also
be encouraged to grant titles to other settlers currently in project area B
during the next five years as well as to incoming settlers. The following
table presents a proposed schedule of land titling:
No. of                                   Titles to    Titles to
Farms                No. of Farms      be Granted    be Granted   Total No.of

1979                 795          6,785             440            398            838
1980                 795          7,580             440            398            838
1981                                                440            398            838
Total                                             2,200          1,592          3,792
/1   Assumption:  Titles would be granted to 10% of established settlers each
year in order to complete one-half of the titling process on these farms
within five years.

16.       The process or regularization of titling in project area B would
require a sizable -ffro- on the part of IBR staff.  In addition to not having
land titles, many settlers, even in IBR colonies, are not aware of the
boundaries of their farms. Furthermore, many settlers in IBR colonies are
under the impression that they occupy private lands, and settlers on private
land often believe they are part of an IBR colony. Therefore, IBR will have
to survey each farm and determine boundaries as a first step. This process
will be necessary even in colonies already surveyed by IBR since many
settlers have located in these areas without regard to official boundaries.
Table 2 gives data on titling operations in Paraguay since 1915.
17.       It is proposed that IBR will receive revenue from land sales to set-
tlers as titles are issued. For area B, small farmers (20 ha average) will be
charged, on average, G 6,000/ha (about US$48/ha) for their land paying 20% as
a deposit when title is issued (or 10% when a certificate is issued), the bal-
ance being payable in equal installments over individually determined periods
ranging from five to fifteen years, with interest at 8% on outstanding bal-
ances, and a one-time commission of 4% of the total sale price payable with
the deposit.

SECOND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
National Development Bank
Introduction
1.        The National Development Bank (BNF), a Government-owned autonomous
entity under the authority of the Ministry of Finance, was established in 1961
as the successor to the bankrupt Bank of Paraguay. Its operations are governed
by its founding legislation of 1961, general banking legislation and regula-
tions of the Central Bank. The basic objective of BNF is to promote agricul-
ture, forestry, industry, and commerce through the provision of credit.
2.        As of December 31, 1976, BNF had a nominal net worth of G 1,321
million (US$10.5 million). Based on the nominal net worth, its total assets
amounted to G 18,327 million (US$145.5 million), including an agricultural
loan portfolio of G 8,642 million (US$68.6 million), an industrial loan
portfolio of G 3,802 million (US$30.2 million), a commercial loan portfolio
of G 1,818 million (US$14.4 million), a merchandise inventory of G 421
million (US$3.3 million). Total staff of the bank was about 1,000 as of
August 1976.
3.        BNF's financial position is weak.  It suffered a loss of about
G 320 million (US$2.6 million) in 1975, and about G 1.1 billion (US$8.6 mil-
lion) in 1976. The adjusted net worth of G 1,321 million (US$10.5 million)
as of December 31, 1976 produced a total debt/equity ratio of 12.9:1 at that
time. However, the Government has expressed its intention to rehabilitate
the bank and appointed new management at the beginning of 1976 to take the
necessary action. In the context of the proposed Industrial Credit Project,
the new management team is initiating a financial program to establish a
sound basis for the bank's operations. As a complement to that project, UNDP
is considering a technical assistance program for BNF. These actions at the
bank level, together with appropriate conditions for the Second Rural Develop-
ment project, would make BNF an acceptable credit channel.
Organization and Management
4.        General.  In addition to its managerial problems, BNF's physical
facilities in Asuncion are inadequate. The Central Bank and BNF share the same
principal building, and many of BNF's departments are scattered among various
nearby buildings because of the lack of space. This condition greatly hinders
effective communication and contact among organizational units. It is likely
that the situation will not be resolved until the Central Bank moves to new
quarters in perhaps two years.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
5.        Policy and Management.  The president of BNF is chairman of the
board of directors, and the seven board members are representatives of the
Mlinistry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the Central
Bank, the crop sector, the livestock sector, and the industrial sector.
The members are appointed for three-year terms.
6.        There is no clear distinction between policy establishment and
execution at BNF, and the board not only sets policy but also becomes involved
in operational matters. (It was meeting on a daily basis in 1976.) Included
in its functions are the formulation of regulations and the approval of
lending programs, budgets and financial statements. In addition, the board
appoints department directors, establishes lending limits for the various
levels of management, and approves loans which exceed the lending authority of
the president.
7.        The president is the chief executive officer, and he directs the
activities of the bank in cooperation with the board. He is appointed by the
President of the Republic for a term of five years. The current president was
appointed in January 1976 with a clear mandate to collect old arrears and
rehabilitate BNF. For about two years prior to this appointment, the Bank
had been under the direction of an interim president who had neither the
mandat2 nor the incentive to deal effectively with its problems. The new
president had worked in the Central Bank and had been responsible for the
collection of the former Bank of Paraguay's outstanding portfolio. He is an
energetic individual and has begun to introduce measures to combat BNF's
problems.
8.        Virtually all management personnel down through the level of division
chief have been replaced. In some cases, individuals have been brought in
from outside the bank, while in others, transfers from other units within the
bank have been used to fill the vacated positions. The two key posts of
director of the Agriculture Department and director of the Development Depart-
ment 1/ are now occupied by the former assistant internal auditor and internal
auditor, respectively. WShile it would have been desirable to assign to these
positions managers with experience in agricultural and industrial credit
operations, an important criterion may have been familiarity with the bank's
activities, combined with a lack of direct involvement in the previous opera-
tions of these departments.
9.        Structure.  The  head office of BNF is located in Asuncion and
serves as the Asuncion branch in addition to providing centralized ser-
vices for the branch network. It consists of three operating departments--
Agriculture, Development, and Commercial--and two service departments--
Administration and Treasurer's. The branches are under the authority of
the Administration Department, as is the recently strengthened Collections
Office. BNF's 38 branches are concentrated primarily in the southeastern
part of the country, which is the region of highest population density and
crop production.
1/   This department handles primarily industrial operations.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
10.       Staff.  In December 31, 1976, BNF had a total staff of about 985, of
which 60% worked at the head office and 40% worked in the branches. Within
the head office, the three operating departments had 27% of the staff, while
the service departments had 73%. Of the operating departments, Agriculture
had 118 staff (74%) Development had 30 (19%) and Commercial had 11 (7%).
Among the branches, Caaguazu, which served two of the settlements of the
on-going rural development project, had the largest staff of 26 (6%) with
the remainder widely distributed in the other branches. This pattern reflects
the concentration of operations in Asuncion and the wide dispersion of opera-
tions outside the capital.
11.       In terms of background, about 4% of the total staff are economists,
14% are public accountants, 10% are technical specialists, 23% are service
personnel (cleaning, maintenance, and such), and as many as 45% are students
(about 90% of whom are secondary school students) who work at BNF while con-
tinuing their studies. There are 87 agricultural technicians (9% of total
staff), of whom 48 (55%) have university-level training and 39 (45%) have
training at the secondary level.
12.       Various units of the bank are hard-pressed to keep up with the work-
load, and it is apparent that BNF has insufficient personnel in some categories
(e.g., managers and technicians) and an overabundance in others (e.g., service
personnel and students).  Thus some additional staff are needed in selected
categories and some existing staff should be released.  The net effect should
be to decrease the total number of staff.  Those existing staff who meet the
requirements need to be upgraded through training.  In the case of agricul-
tural technicians, for example, the number of borrowers which each one has to
attend is frequently so high that there is no time for providing technical
assistance. The effective borrower/technician ratio of 200 or more should be
reduced, giving due consideration to the costs involved and the need to
approach small farmers on a group basis (paras 26 and 27).
13.       BNF recognizes that its staff requires a substantial amount of
training, and it is preparing a program of training courses which will en-
compass virtually all categories of personnel. It has requested IDB to
support the design and implementation of the training program, and the IDB is
now considering the request. This assistance would complement the on-going
technical assistance program financed by IDB and the UNDP technical assistance
program planned in conjunction with the proposed Industrial Credit Project
(paras 18 and 19).
14.       For all training courses, emphasis should be placed on a develop-
ment approach, on instilling fundamental concepts which are actually employed
in the bank's operations, and on ensuring that these concepts are well under-
stood by the participants. In the case of agricultural technicians, for
example, concepts for the analysis of farm development plans could include a
whole-farm approach, some measure of financial viability such as the financial
rate of return, and a consideration of debt service in relation to the incre-
mental income produced by the investment (para 25).



ANNEX 3
Page 4
15.       Information.  The present accounting system produces statements
which are often delayed and distorted. Part of the problem stems from genuine
accounting difficulties, such as the treatment ef the amounts owed BNF by the
Government on account of the Agriculture Department losses. But much of its
is due to the lack of policy guidance, the use of manual procedures, ineffec-
tive controls, etc. The system has been partially computerized, and consul-
tants under the IDB-financed technical assistance program are helping BNF
utilize the computer facilities more effectively (para 18).
16.       The internal auditing system has not been effective in identifying
and correcting the deficiencies of the accounting system, but the internal
auditor's office has been strengthened and it perhaps has the potential to
perform the necessary control functions, with appropriate guidance. The
Superintendency of Banks is slow, and its reports are not readily available.
In addition, its evaluation focuses mainly on compliance with banking regula-
tions. BNF's private external auditor is the reputable Argentine firm of
Harteneck, Lopez, and Co. However, the condition of the bank's accounts
caused the external auditor to issue highly qualified opinions. A supple-
mental audit, therefore, was performed to evaluate the portfolio, the merchan-
dise inventory, and the Government account as of July 31, 1976. The audit
provides BNF with a reasonably accurate basis against which to measure future
operations. The external auditor has assisted BNF in analyzing the portfolio
in arrears and in preparing arrears recovery plans.
17.       BNF produces few statistics, and the data which are compiled are
available only after considerable delay. The bank needs a computerized system
which will produce basic statistics quickly. Included should be analyses of
loan commitments by term, purpose, size, size of borrower, branch, etc.;
delinquent loans; and recovery rates. The consultants will help BNF install
such a system (paras 18 and 19).
18.       Technical Assistance.  IDB is financing currently a technical
assistance program (ATN/SF 1316-PR) for the reorganization of the adminis-
trative and accounting systems, revision of the organizational structure of
the lending program for small- and medium-sized farmers supported by IDB, and
evaluation of industrial projects. The first component is aimed primarily at
the computerization of the accounting system.
19.       UNDP will be financing, in conjunction with the proposed Indus-
trial Credit Project, approximately eight man-years of consultant services
for BNF involving some seven consultants over a two and a half year period.
Emphasis will be placed on financial management, especially programming and
budgeting; the accounting system, particularly the production of useful
financial statements and the establishment of a cost accounting capability;
personnel management, especially the formulation of a manpower development
program; and agricultural credit policies and procedures. Included in the
group of consultants will be two financial advisors, accounting advisors, one
personnel advisor, and one agricultural credit advisor. The personnel
training program which BNF has submitted for consideration of IDB (para 13)
would form a component of the manpower development program.

Lending Policies and Procedures
20.       General.  BNF does not have any consistent set of policies and
procedures. Interest rates, for example, vary according to the resources used
to finance the loans, and procedures vary according to the program. M4anuals
produced at the time of the bank's founding in 1961 have been superceded in
the case of certain departments and certain programs but remain in effect for
others. The policy statement prepared in the context of the proposed Indus-
trial Credit Project will define a consistent set of policies for the bank as
a whole.
21.       Agriculture Department.  The Agriculture Department operates
basically under two sets of credit regulations. The first dates from 1967 and
applies to large farmers. It is not very specific and thus leaves many points
to be decided on an ad hoc basis. The second was prepared in 1975 for the
lending program for small and medium farmers supported by IDB and is quite
complete.
22.       BNF finances all types of agricultural operations, including crops,
livestock, fisheries, and forestry. It provides loans for short-term working
capital needs (up to one year), for medium-term investments such as machinery
and draft animals (one to five years), and long-term investments such as
irrigation, pasture establishment, and farm development plans (five to 10
years). Grace periods range up to about four years. Loans to small and
medium farmers (those with an agricultural net worth less than G 3,150,000 or
US$25,000) may not exceed G 1,134,000 (US$9,000) and those to small and medium
ranchers (those with an agricultural net worth less than G 5,670,000 or
US$45,000) may not exceed G 1,890,000 (US$15,000). Loans may finance up to
100% of investment cost in exceptional cases, but normally a contribution is
required of the borrower. (For the on-going rural development project, a
minimum contribution of 10% is required. For other loans, the amount of the
contribution varies widely.) Loans may not exceed 50% of the value of a
chattel mortgage or 60% of the value of a mortgage. A chattel mortgage is
required for medium-term loans and most short-term loans, and a mortgage is
required for long-term loans.
23.       As of September 1976, interest rates ranged from 9 to 12%, plus a
flat fee of 1% of the total loan amount. A penalty rate 50% higher thas the
relevant interest rate is charged on overdue amounts. Under Section 4.04 of
the Project Agreement for the ongoing rural development project, BNF was to
have raised the interest rate on all loans granted after May 1975 to a minimum
of 12%. The bank is now adjusting all new loans to the 12% minimum rate. BNF
has now agreed to raise the average yield on all new loans to a minimum of 13%.
24.       Appraisal of loan applications normally is carried out on the basis
of a field visit, during which the BNF technician discusses the proposal with
the farmer and analyzes its technical viability.  However, even though there
has been substantial effort directed toward establishing a development orien-
tation, and although there are some technicians who seem to have an under-
standing of cost/benefit concepts, BNF's lending is still heavily weighted



ANNEX 3
Page 6
toward commercial considerations. Thus there is an emphasis on the cost of
items to be fi-prr-52 the general financial status of the applicant, and the
adequacy of the security offered, rather than the likely return to the farmer
and the technical assistance inputs necessary to enable him to achieve that
return.
25.       Appraisals generally focus on the specific items to be financed,
rather than the whole farm, except in the case of livestock operations and the
farm plans being financed under the on-going project. Again, except in
special cases, there is no determination made of the incremental income to be
produced by the investment financed and therefore no analysis of the return on
investment or the relationship between the debt service and the additional
income produced (para 14).
26.       The quality of supervision varies widely.  Normally a technician
visits the borrower prior to the disbursement of the next tranche of his
loan, but the frequency of the visits and the length of time that the tech-
nician can spend with the borrower are limited by the number of borrowers
to be served by the technician (para 12).
27.       Development Department.  The Development Department provides loans
for industry, agroindustry, crafts, and some livestock operations. Most of
the loans are medium- or long-term, but some short-term loans are granted as
complementary financing of seasonal working capital. Current interest rates
are 9 to 12%. A commission ranging generally from 1 to 3% is charged on the
total loan amount at the time of signing and one in the same range is charged
on the outstanding balance at 3- to 12- months intervals. The average yield
on new loans will be increased to a minimum of 13% in the context of the
Industrial Credit Project (para 23).
28.       Commercial Department.  The Commercial Department is responsible for
all commercial banking operations. It provides short-term loans which rarely
exceed six months' maturity. Interest rates generally are at 12%, and BNF
also charges a commmission ranging from 0.25 to 1.5% at three-month intervals.
Effective interest rates on commercial lines of credit, rated over a three
month interval, equal 20% or more per annum.
Operations
29.       Agriculture Department.  Loans committed by the Agricultural Depart-
ment increased from G 1,193 million in 1970 to G 3,656 in 1975/76 1/, or 206%.
The number of loans committed rose from 6,990 in 1970 to 8,303 in 1974/75, or
19%. Thus, the average loan size increased from G 171,000 in 1970 to G 301,000
in 1974/75, or 76%. Commitments are expected to increase about 15% per year
through 1981 (about 9% per year in real terms).
1/   Agricultural year July 1 to June 30.  Lending occurs primarily in the
first half of the year. Thus, agricultural year 1975/76 corresponds
roughly to calendar year 1975 in terms of lending.

30.       The Agriculture Department grants a large number of small loans to
small and medium farmers and a small number of large loans to large farmers.
Of loans committed in 1975/76, G 2,252 million (62%) were for small and medium
farmers, while G 1,404 million (38%) were for large farmers.  Although the
major proportion of loans are short-term (58% by amount in 1975/76), a sub-
stantial portion are medium- and long-term (42%). The table below shows a
breakdown of loans committed in 1975/76 by term and size of borrower (amounts

As can be seen, the major proportion of funds was granted to cover labor cost
while most of the remainder was for cultivation chemicals. The proportion
going to labor was substantially larger in the case of small and medium farmers
than for large farmers.

granted in 1975/76 by purpose and size of borrower (amounts in G million).

1/   Building and other constructions.
As indicated, the largest proportion of funds was granted for the purchase
of machinery, the second largest for land development, and the third largest
for facilities. These three categories accounted for 86% of the total.
Facilities and land development were the largest categories for small and
medium farmers while machinery accounted for the vast majority of funds for
large farmers.
33.       One of the most unfortunate lending programs implemented by the
Agriculture Department was that undertaken in support of the Government's
program to increase production of food grains, particularly wheat, which was
initiated in 1966. BNF hurriedly made large loans of up to 100% of cost to
mainly absentee landowners who frequently had little or no experience in
grain cultivation. Appraisal of applications was minimal, wheat often was
planted on unsuitable land, and there was considerable over-investment in
machinery. Massive defaults resulted. In early 1973, the Government decreed
that any wheat loan borrower could have his loan restructured with principal
to be repaid by 1983 and interest to be paid by 1988. Some loans were
restructured while others were   not.  Those loans which were least likely to
be repaid, including some restructured loans and some non-restructured loans,
were transferred to the Government account (para 48).
34.       In response to a perceived scarcity of input suppliers, BNF became
involved in the supply of current inputs (primarily seeds, fertilzers, and
insecticides) and farm implements. However, purchases exceeded sales. As a
result, the merchandise inventory increased 105% during the years 1974 and
1975 to a level of G 648 million (4% of total assets) as of December 31, 1975.
BNF has sold a lot of the merchandise during 1976 although prices of some
items (particularly fertilizer) fell substantially below the purchase prices
and problems of deterioration affected other items. The external auditor has,
therefore, recommended additional provisions to reflect these factors.  In any
case, this is a costly operation completely outside the scope of BNF's field
of competence, and the network of private suppliers is adequate to meet the
needs of producers. BNF's management is aware of the problem and is now
prepared to phase out its involvement in this kind of operation.

35.       Development Department.  In 1975, the Development Departmaent com-
mitted 163 loans for G 427 million, of which 90 (55%) for G 329 million (77%)
were for industry and the remainder were for livestock and crafts. The
average loan size was G 2.62 million. Among industrial loans, the wood sub-
sector accounted for 59% (by amount), and wood, food, and textiles together
accounted for 90%. In terms of the Development Department's portfolio at the
end of 1975, 3% of the number of loans represented 60% of the amount, and 70%
of the amount was for projects in Asuncion.
36.       Commercial Department.  The Commercial Department is responsible
for all normal commercial operations. It receives demand, savings and time
deposits, and makes short-term loans, primarily for commercial purposes.
Resources
37.       General.  At the end of 1976, BNF had total nominal resources of
G 18,327 million of which G 1,321 million (7%) were in equity, G 11,885
milion (65%) were in borrowings and government counterpart contributions,
G 4,348 million (24%) were in deposits, and G 773 million (4%) were in other
liabilities. Among borrowings, 35% were from domestic sources and 65% were
from foreign sources (see Tables 1 and 2 for historical and projected balance
sheets and income statements.)
38.       Equity.  BNF's equity position is complicated by the treatment of
Agriculture Department losses. According to BNF's founding legislation, the
Government will compensate the bank for these losses. However, no timing is
specified, and such payments therefore are at the discretion of the Govern-
ment. The Government agreed in mid-1976 to pay off this accumulated debt of
G 887 million (July 1, 1976) at the rate of G 126 million a year. For the
future, however, it would be appropriate to consider Agriculture Department
losses as a diminution of equity.
39.       Operational losses in 1976 reached a level of about G 1,072 million
(US$8.5 million) and may decline to about G 84 million (US$0.7 million) in
1977. Thereafter, BNF is expected to operate with a small profit margin.
Furthermore, the government's commitment to make an equity contribution of
about G 2,437 million (US$19.3 million) during the 1977-80 period, should
enable the institution to substantially improve its financinal structure and
results. Thus effective equity would increase from G 1,321 million (US$10.5
million) at the end of 1976 to about G 3,640 million (US$28.9 million) at the
end of 1980.
40.       Borrowings.  The borrowings of about G 4.0 billion as of December 31,
1976 from internal sources were provided by the Central Bank at interest rates
ranging from 4% to 6%. In mid-1976, G 2,960 million of this amount was
converted to long-term debt, payable over 12 years at 4% interest. The
Central Bank provides some discounts, funds for livestock loans, and financing
for seasonal crop loans.



ANNEX 3
Page 10
41.        Of the external borrowings of G 7.5 billion at December 31, 1976,
9% were short-term and 91% were medium- and long-term. The short-term
financing was provided by five commercial banks in the United States and
Europe. Of the medium- and long-term financing, 34% was provided by 1DB,
16% by AID, 13% by KfW, 12% by the Bank of Brazil, 8% by the Instituto
di Credito per le Imprese di Publica Utilita, 6% by the National Bank of
Argentina, and 10% by other sources 1including IDA and suppliers. The maturi-
ties of these borrowings range from three to 40 years and the interest rates
from 0.75% on some of the AID funds to 11.5% on the financing from the Union
of Swiss Banks. Funds from IDB have been used to finance loans Lo small and
medium farmers and industrialists, AID funds were used primarily to finance
loans to grain farmers, and most of the remaining funds have been used to
finance imports from the respective countries.
42.        In the future, BNF's debt resources will come primarily from the
Central Bank in the case of short-term funds and from IDB, AID, and the Bank
Group in the case of long-term funds. IDB is considering a continuation of
its support for the financing of small and medium producers, while AID is
considering a project to finance cooperatives. The Bank would provide funds
under the proposed Industrial Credit and Second Rural Development Projects, in
addition to the funds available under IDA Credit 509-PA.
43.       Deposits.  Deposits increased from G 1,184 million at the end of
1971 to G 4,348 million at the end of 1976. As of the latter date, G 1,468
million (34%) were in demand deposits, G 2,880 million (66%) were in savings
deposits and time deposits. The weighted average interest paid on savings
and time deposits is about 7.5%. When the legal reserve requirement of 42%
on deposits is taken into consideration, the weighted average cost of all
deposits is about 9%.
Use of Resources
44.       Total assets grew from G 11,570 million at the end of 1971 to
G 18,327 million at the end of 1976, or 58%. As of the latter date, cash and
banks amounted to G 609 million (4%), legal reserve requirements G 1,721
million (9%), net loan portfolio G 12,429 million (61%), interest receivable
G 1,119 million (5%), merchandise inventory G 319 million (1%), and other
assets G 1,821 million (4%).
45.       About 52% of BNF's loan portfolio as of December 31, 1975 was held
by the head office in Asuncion, and the remaining 48% was heLd by the 38
branches. Of the head office portfolio, 35% was for the Agriculture Depart-
ment, 58% for the Development Department, and 7% for the Commercial Depart-
ment. Of the branch portfolio, 85% was for the Agriculture Department, 3% was
for the Development Department, and 13% was for the Commercial Department.
The Agriculture Department's portfolio thus was held 31% by the head office
and 69% by the branches.



ANNEX 3
Page 11
46.       BNF's arrears are much too high.  They amounted to about 22% of
portfolio at the end of 1976, compared with 13% at the end of 1973. 1/ The
figures were 23% for the Agriculture Department, 11% for the Development
Department, and 36% for the Commercial Department. On the basis of an analy-
sis of a portion of the portfolio in arrears, the auditor estimated that
approximately half of the portfolio may be more than one year overdue. BNF
has begun to computerize its information on delinquent loans and, with assist-
ance from the Bank and IDB, is preparing recovery plans, and establishing
appropriate recovery targets.
47.       As of December 31, 1976 provisions for irrecoverable loans amounted
to G 1,837 million, or 13% of the total outstanding portfolio.
48.       Improvement in the strength of the portfolio will result from
upgrading the appraisal and supervision of subprojects and the reinforcement
of collection procedures. The former is being tackled at the local level
through the ongoing Small Farmer Credit and Rural Development Project, and
this effort would be continued in the proposed Second Rural Development
Project. At the national level, the UNDP consultant team will assist in
the implementation of improved appraisal and supervision techniques and pro-
cedures and will help formulate the manpower development plan to upgrade staff
quality and efficiency. The Collection Office has been strengthened, and new
collection procedures are being introduced. The consultant team also will
assist in further improving the collection system.
Financial Position
49.       BNF's financial position at the end of 1976 was extremely weak.  It
is expected to improve significantly as a result of the various actions to be
taken. The bank's liquidity ratio (about 1.5 at the end of 1976) improved
as a result of the restructuring of the major portion of its Central Bank
debt in mid-year. The ratio is projected to remain at about that level
through the 1980's. These figures are entirely satisfactory. BNF relies
heavily on Central Bank for meeting short-term borrowing requirements.
50.       The total debt/equity ratio incrased from 5.8:1 at the end of 1971
to 12.9:1 at the end of 1976. These figures demonstrate the serious under-
capitalization of BNF. However, as a result of the Government's agreed to
capital contributions, the ratio is expected to decline to a satisfactory
level of about 6.6:1 by the end of 1977.
Results of Operations
51.       BNF's income statements generally have shown a fictitious profit
which amounted to G 13 million in 1971 and G 93 million in 1975. However, if
the Agriculture Department losses had not been transferred to the Government
1/   BNF defines arrears as amounts overdue by more than one month.



ANNEX 3
Page 12
account, BNF would have shown a loss of G 228 million for 1971 and G 316
million for 1975 and G 1,072 million in 1976 which includes the present esti-
mate of accumulated provisions chargeable to previous years.
52.       Interest and commissions received amounted to 11.2% of average
outstanding portfolio in 1976, with financial expenses representing 5.9%,
giving a financial spread of 5.3%. However, operating costs were 5.7% of
portfolio, producing an operating loss, and the deduction of provisions
resulted in a higher total loss. By 1980, interest and commissions received
are expected to increase to 13.3% and financial expenses are expected to
decline to 5.4%, producing a financial spread of 7.9%. Meanwhile, operating
costs are expected to decrease to 5.0%, giving an operating profit of 2.9%.
Provisions of 1.0% would leave a net profit of 1.9%.
53.       BNF's poor profit performance has been caused by high operating
costs, poor portfolio recovery, and, to a lesser extent, a low financial
spread on borrowings from certain sources. Political influences contributed
significantly to the impact of these individual factors. Perhaps the major
cause of BNF's high operating costs is its excessive staff (para 12). Thus,
while salary increases such as that which occurred at the end of 1975 may be
justified in terms of the need to recruit and retain competent staff, they
produce an exaggerated impact on operating costs because of the excessive
number of personnel. BNF will increase the productivity of its staff through
the implementation of the manpower development plan. Because of the low
portfolio recovery, bad debt costs also are very high. To combat this prob-
lem, BNF strengthened its collection office and is introducing new collection
procedures (para 51).  Specific recovery plans have been prepared to reduce
existing arrears (para 49). Certain borrowings, particularly those from
the Bank of Brazil and the National Bank of Argentina, were obtained at
7% and used to finance loans at an effective rate of about 10%, thus leaving
an entirely inadequate financial spread of about 3%, at least for the Agricul-
ture Department.
Rehabilitation Program
54.       In conjunction with thne proposed Industrial Credit Project, BNF is
undertaking a rehabilitation program to increase the efficiency of its ope-
rations, improve its financial position, and earn a modest net profit. The
primary targets are to raise the average yield on new loans to a minimum of
13% shortly after effectiveness of that project, lower operating costs to
5.4% of the portfolio, and reach a total debt/equity ratio of 8:1.
55.       In order to help it reach these goals, BNF will establish a pro-
gramming and budgeting office for the preparation and control of implementa-
tion of lending programs and financial plans. It will also revamp its
accounting system to facilitate the production of more accurate financial
statements on a timely basis, and the analysis of the cost of specific acti-
vities. Another element of the program is the formulation of a manpower
development plan which will involve the selective increase of some categories



ANNEX 3
Page 13
of staff, the decrease of others and the training of staff to perform defined
functions. The eventual result will be a decrease in the number and cost of
personnel, and an increase in staff efficiency. Finally, BNF will prepare and
implement the debt recovery plan, which was approved by its Administrative
Council in April 1977.

SECOND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Performance Under the Small Farmer
Credit and Rural Development Project
Project Description
1.        The project consists of a package of investments designed to raise
production and living standards in the three public settlement colonies of
l4allorquin, Repatriacion, and General Stroessner in the Eastern Region of
Paraguay. As appraised, it included a lending program to finance on-farm
investments and incremental working capital for about 2,000 small farmers;
the construction of about 60 km of all-weather roads and 250 km of earth
roads, about 26 primary schools, two health centers (plus the purchase of
equipment for a third), and three community centers; the purchase of some
50 vehicles for the use of the participating agencies; and the coordination
of the participating agencies. It is supported by a UNDP-financed technical
assistance program.
2.        Project policy is established by the National Council for Social
Progress (CNPS), a coordinating body at the ministerial level. Each agency
is responsible for implementing the project component falling within its
jurisdiction. Thus, the National Development Bank (BNF) carries out the
lending program, the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG) provides
technical assistance to farmers, the Institute of Rural Welfare (IBR) is
responsible for land titling, the Ministry of Public Works and Communica-
tions (MOPC) is constructing the roads and community centers, the Ministry
of Education is building the schools, and the Ministry of Public Health
and Social Welfare (MSPBS) is constructing the health centers. The Project
Coordinator is responsible for facilitating the work of these agencies.
3.        Virtually all of the 5,000 rural families living in the three
settlement colonies will benefit from the roads, schools, health centers,
and community centers, while about 40% (2,000) will receive credit for on-
farm investments and incremental working capital. Implementation of the
infrastructure components is planned over a four-year period; subloans were
expected to be committed over three years and disbursed over four.
Farm Credit Program
4.        Farmers with 10 to 20 ha of land, of which about 5 ha are partially
cleared, obtain credit to finance additional clearing, pasture establishment,
purchase of draft animals and farm equipment, and construction of storage
facilities. They also receive credit to finance incremental working capital
needs such as seed, fertilizer, insecticides, and cultivation.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
5.        Terms and Conditions.  Investment and incremental working capital
cost is financed 10% by the farmer, 20% by the Government (through an gquity
contribution to BNF), and 70% by IDA. Investment subloans have a maturity
of five to 10 years including a maximum grace period of two years, and incre-
mental working capital subloans have a maximum maturity of one year. The
interest rate on all subloans is 12%, plus a service fee of 1%. Subloans are
granted on the basis of farm plans prepared by the BNF technicians.
6.        Commitment.  The credit program has demonstrated reasonable progress
after a slow start aggravated by land titling delays, management changes at
BNF, and insufficient BNF technicians. At the end of February 1977, 861 long-
term subloans for US$2.2 million had been committed since the beginning of the
project, in comparison with the appraisal estimate of 1,200 subloans for
US$3.4 million through the end of 1976. The table below compares the yearly
progress of subloan commitment with that projected at appraisal (amounts in
US$'000).
Appraisal Estimate                        Actual
Year         No.    Amount   Cum. Amount         No.    Amount   Cum. Amount
1975         400      1,149       1,149          321        636        636

1977 /1      800      2,298       5,745           10         32      2,210
Total   2,000      5,745                      861      2,210
/1   The actual figures are through February 1977.
8.        It is clear that the credit program is behind the appraisal esti-
mates. The reasons for this are not yet entirely clear but various factors
might have contributed to the less than expected lending volume. First,
effectiveness of Credit 509-PA was delayed until April 1975, some four months
later than anticipated at appraisal, and the lending program was not initiated
until June of that year. Also, IBR was slow in processing land titles, al-
though this process was expedited by the issuance of certificates beginning
in September 1975 (para 17). In addition, BNF did not assign the agreed
number of 15 technicians to the project area, and this problem was not
resolved until more than a year after the start of implementation (September
1976). The change in BNF management at the beginning of 1976 was one of the
factors delaying the assignment of technicians, and it also led to inadequate
supervision of the project branches (para 27). More recently, the increase
in technicians was not accompanied by an increase in administrative staff
at the project branches, but this has been remedied subsequently. The heavy
seasonal fluctuation of short-term lending cannot be avoided, but BNF's
practice of including short-term and long-term financing in the same subloan
has multiplied the impact on the peak workload. Consequently, BNF is attempt-
ing to schedule the preparation of farm development plans and long-term lend-
ing for the off-season, thus spreading the workload more evenly throughout



ANNEX 4
Page 3
the year. Finally, substantial farmer liquidity resulting from favorable
prices in the 1975/76 crop year reduced the total demand for, and average
size of, subloans, especially short-term credit.
9.        Now that the project's organizational structure has been established
and steps are being taken to make it more efficient, the credit program may
meet the target this year. Nevertheless, there will be a carryover of the
shortfalls of the first two years, and, consequently, the present alloca-
tion of long-term funds probably will not be fully committed before the end
of 1978, or one year later than the appraisal estimate. If short-term
lending does not increase substantially, there may be an excess of funds in
this category which might be used for additional long-term subloans. BNF has
made adequate funds available to support the credit program, as stipulated in
Section 4.02 of the Project Agreement.
10.       Subloan Size.  The average size of long-term subloan granted through
February 1977 was about US$2,600, or about 9% less than the appraisal estimate
of US$2,870, while the average size of short-term subloan granted was US$604,
or over 60% less than the appraisal estimate of US$1,670. The smaller sub-
loan may be the result of the farmers' lack of familiarity with debt financing
and consequent reluctance to incur debt. In addition, short-term subloans
are affected by a lower level of cash requirements than expected at appraisal,
combined with the favorable crop prices which have enabled farmers to use
their own funds for production requirements, relying less on borrowed funds.
11.       Investment Structure.  As of August 31, 1976, the structure of
investments, as compared with the appraisal estimate, was as follows:
Proportion
Appraisal      Actual
-------    %   ----------
Land clearing                                19           25
Farm equipment and storage                   23           29
Pasture establishment and fending            21           18
Draft animals and livestock                  37           28
Total                                  100         100
Favorable crop prices have encouraged farmers to increase their area of
cleared land and increased the demand for equipment and storage facilities.
In contrast, low meat prices have reduced the demand for pasture establishment
and livestock.
12.       Subproject Implementation.  Implementation of farm development
plans is progressing satisfactorily. Supply of current inputs and capital
goods is adequate, and investments are being carried out according to the



ANNEX 4
Page 4
planned schedules. Technical assistance to farmers has not been at the level
anticipated, although some of the inadequacy has been met by the credit, exten-
sion, and marketing consultants. Efforts are being made to ensure that an
adequate technical assistance capability is developed among the BNF and MAG
technicians.
13.       Technical Assistance.  The technical assistance provided to project
farmers by the participating agencies has not met appraisal expectations.
BNF was late in assigning the full complement of technicians to the project
(para 8), but they are reasonably well qualified and will improve their per-
formance as they gain experience and strengthen their knowledge of the finan-
cial aspects of farm development. The credit consultant was performing an
important training role, but he had to leave in September 1976 for health
reasons and was replaced in February 1977.
14.       The major weakness in the technical assistance system lies with the
extensionists of MAG. They were to collaborate with the BNF technicians in
providing technical assistance to farmers and were to assume much of the
responsibility for the preparation of farm plans. Unfortunately, they have
little capability in farm planning and have continued to focus on their
traditional activities of organizing farmer associations and cooperatives.
In addition, many of the extensionists have limited qualifications and their
turnover is high. The consultant team will prepare a specific training
program on farm planning for the extensionists which will also be open to
BNF technicians. Furthermore, MAG is planning to increase compensation for
extensionists in order to recruit and retain more qualified people.
15.       Collection Performance.  As of August 31, 1976, the repayments on
project subloans received by the Caaguazu branch of BNF represented 106% of
amounts falling due in 1976. The figure exceeds 100% because of prepayments
on long-term subloans as a result of favorable crop prices and consequent
farmer liquidity. The Mallorquin branch had a recovery of 94%, which was
affected by a poor vegetable harvest. Arrears amounted to 1.2% of portfolio
for Caaguazu, 4.3% for Mallorquin, and 2.2% for the project as a whole.
Land Titling Program
16.       IBR has had continuing difficulties in meeting the land titling
requirements of the project, some of which resulted from changing requirements
for obtaining titles. Initially, titles were issued once settlers had paid 25%
of the cost of the land, but because settlers had difficulty in meeting this re-
quirement, IBR, in September 1975, agreed to issue titles after payments equal-
ling 10% of the land cost had been made. Later, in August 1976, however, the
requirement was raised once more to 25%. It has been agreed that the require-
ment will again be set at 10% for the remainder of the ongoing project and for
the proposed project as well.
17.       The major difficulty, however, is simply the slow rate at which IBR
processes titles. Because of the extended delay involved, IBR agreed in



ANNEX 4
P'age 5
September 1975 to issue certificates to eligible settlers which serve as tem-
porary titles and indicate that the final titles would be issued within a
month. This mechanism at least has permitted the credit program to proceed,
since BNF accepts the certificate for lending purposes. However, the final
titles generally are not issued within a month, and IBR is planning to extend
the validity of the certificates.
18.       By the end of 1975, 360 project settlers had received titles or
certificates, representing 90% of the target for the year -- 400. As of
February 1977, 707 settlers had received titles, compared with the cumulative
total of 1,200 projected for the end of 1976. IBR expects that 2,000 settlers
would receive titles by mid-1978. In order to expedite IBR's titling effort,
a work plan has been formulated and the Coordinator will supervise closely
the execution of the plan.
Roads
19.       The equipment package, consisting of three motorgraders, three bull-
dozers, six trucks, a mobile workshop, and auxiliary equipment, has been
procured and is being employed in the project area. As the design phase of
the project road network is being completed, the equipment is being used to
make temporary improvements on existing earth tracks, permitting better market
access for farmers. About 700 km of tracks have been improved in the three
colonies.
20.       Consultants have been retained to design the 250 km of earth roads
and 60 km of all-weather roads included in the project. This work is expected
to be completed by about May 1977. The earth roads are being constructed by
MOPC under force account, and construction of new roads began in October 1976
and is expected to be completed by the end of 1978. Bid documents for the
all-weather roads are being prepared, and it is expected that MOPC will also
construct the earthworks for these roads by force account, using local
contractors to install the stone paving.
Schools
21.       The schools component has been reduced to the construction of 19
primary schools with 92 classrooms, as compared with the appraisal estimate
of 26 schools with 102 classrooms. It was reduced because of cost overruns
resulting from substantial price increases subsequent to appraisal and because
it was felt that the priority demand for education could be met by the smaller
component. By installing a higher number of classrooms per school, 90% of the
classrooms anticipated at appraisal will be provided in 73% of the number of
schools.
22.       The nine schools with 48 classrooms included in the first phase were
completed in December 1976 by firms operating under contract to ME.  Equipment
for these schools is being donated by UNICEF, and the schools began operation



ANNEX 4
Page 6
operation at the start of the school year in February 1977.  Prequalification
of contractors has been completed for the 10 schools with 44 classrooms in-
cluded in the second phase. Construction is expected to be completed to
start operation in June 1978.
Health Centers
23.       At appraisal, it was expected that two health centers would be
constructed, one each in Repatriacion and General Stroessner, and an existing
center in Mallorquin equipped. The present plan calls for the construction
of an additional center in Mallorquin in order to better meet the basic medical
needs of the population in that colony. Construction of the three health
centers, by contract with MSPBS, was completed by December 1976, and equipment
for the four is expected to be delivered by September 1977.
Community Centers
24.       Bids for the three community centers, one in each of the project
colonies, are expected to be called by MOPC by early 1977, and construc-
tion is scheduled for completion by December 1977.
Vehicles
25.       Twenty-five vehicles have been purchased under the project, as com-
pared with 50 contemplated at appraisal. At the beginning of project imple-
mentation, it was decided that the initial purchase would be for half the esti-
mated requirement and that procurement of the second lot would be postponed
until a more precise determination of the need could be made. Project progress
has been reasonable without the additional vehicles.
Organization and Mlanagement
26.       Coordinator.  The project provides for a Coordinator, attached to
CNPS, who has the direct responsibility for coordination of the work of the
various participating agencies. Among his duties are the approval of subloans
and the authorization of withdrawal requests. The Coordinator has performed
well to date in a difficult role. He works well with the participating
agencies and has been reasonably successful in causing them to undertake their
respective programs. Although the Coordinator has not so far prepared annual
work schedules for the project, as he is required to do, he has agreed to pre-
pare them in the future, and they should enable him to maintain closer super-
vision of project implementation.
27.       BNF.  Subsequent to appraisal, a caretaker administration was
installed at BNF which had little incentive to attack BNF's problems or pursue
an aggressive role in project implementation. As a result, BNF's participa-
tion during the first year of project execution was weak, and various require-
ments under the project were not met. At the beginning of 1976, a permanent
president was appointed and virtually all managers down through the department



ANNEX 4
Page 7
and division levels were changed. While many of the new appointees were trans-
ferred from other posts within the bank, BNF's operating capability was impaired
by those changes. Managers presently are still in the process of organizing
their units and formulating new work programs.
28.       BNF's financial position continues in a precarious state, with sub-
stantial losses having been incurred in recent years and very large provisions
having to be made in the near future for additional, expected losses (Annex
3). Arrears amount to about 22% of portfolio. In the context of the proposed
Industrial Credit Project, BNF is undertaking a rehabilitation plan desigred
to achieve a reasonably sound financial status by 1979. The Government will
support the plan with a program of capital contributions beyond those required
under Section 3.14 of the Credit Agreement for the Small Farmer Project.
UNDP also will support the plan by financing a technical assistance program
involving some eight man-years of consultant assistance for BNF.
29.       In spite of its organizational and financial difficulties, BNF's
performance has improved during the course of project implementation. Besides
assigning the required technicians, it is now providing adequate administra-
tive support and has begun an analysis of measures to spread the workload more
evenly throughout the year and increase the efficiency of its branch staff
(para 8). Additional efforts will be made to increase supervision of the
project and adjust the compensation of technician to prevent their flight to
more lucrative jobs.
30.       BNF has been slow to fulfill the covenants of the Project Agreement
for the ongoing project designed to improve its general performance. Section
3.02 requires BNF to strengthen its Collections Office (Oficina de Normaliza-
cion de Prestamos) to enable it to review all overdue loans and take appro-
priate action. The Office finally was strengthened in mid-1976, and a proposal
was prepared to transfer all loans in arrears for more than a given period to
the Office and to introduce a procedure for recovering the payments overdue.
31.       Section 3.03 (a) of the Project Agreement stipulates that BNF reco-
ver, by September 1975, 20% of the principal of grain loans in arrears as of
December 31, 1972. BNF indicated that it had recovered 17% by the end of July
1975, and this performance was deemed to be a reasonable fulfillment of the
covenant. Section 3.03 (b) specifies that BNF was to furnish IDA, by
September 1975, a detailed analysis of the remaining grain loans in arrears
as of December 31, 1972 and a plan for their write-off or recovery, with prin-
cipal to be rapaid by 1983 and interest to be paid by 1988. BNF's submission
in fulfillment of this covenant, however, did not present an analysis of
arrears, indicate a judgment on provisions, make meaningful recommendations
on extensions, or give projections of recovery of arrears and the steps that
would be taken to effect the recoveries. Section 3.03 (c) stipulates that BNF
also was to furnish IDA, by September 1975, a plan for the reduction of arrears
not covered by the first plan to 10% of portfolio for each department by
September 1976. A submission was received by IDA in September 1976, but
lacked the necessary detail, as in the case of the grain loans. Since arrears



ANNEX 4
Page 8
were about 22% as of December 31, 1976, the target was not met.  However,
BNF retained its external auditors to assist it in reviewing its portfolio,
and, with their help, a debt recovery plan was finalized in April 1977.
32.       Section 4.04 of Project Agreement required BNF to raise its interest
rate to a minimum of 12% on all loans granted after May 14, 1975, but some
loans still were being granted at 9% as late as September 1976. BNF claimed
that it was adjusting the interest rate to 12% on all new loans during
October 1976. In the context of the proposed Industrial Credit Project, it
has been agreed that BNF would increase the average yield on all its loans
to a minimum of 13%.
33.       Section 4.05 of the Project Agreement stipulates that BNF will
maintain a liquidity ratio (excluding short-term financing from the Central
Bank) of at least 1.1 and a medium- and long-term debt/equity ratio not exceed-
ing 4:1. The liquidity ratio met the requirement as of August 31, 1976, but
because of the long-term refinancing of BNF's debt to the Central Bank in July
1976, the debt/equity ratio was beyond the specified limit. In order to pro-
vide BNF greater flexibility in its financial arrangements while maintaining
a reasonable relationship between debt and equity, the proposed Second Rural
Development and Industrial Credit Projects are focussing on the single crite-
rion of the total debt/equity ratio and requiring that this ratio reach 8:1
by the end of 1978.
34.       IBR.  Although IBR has a large staff of some 470, it is involved
in so many activities that it does not perform any of them very well. In
particular, its surveying and land titling activities have suffered as a
result of its attempts to promote marketing programs, organize cooperatives,
etc. The implementation of a detailed work plan under the close supervision
of the Coordinator should improve IBR's titling performance (para 18).
35.       MAG.  As mentioned earlier, one of MAG's major difficulties is that
its staff salaries are too low to attract and retain competent extensionists.
Normally, MAG can recruit only those who have just completed their academic
training and have little or no experience. They acquire experience working
with MAG and then move on to higher-paying jobs in the private sector. Fur-
thermore, the more competent graduates enter directly into the private sector.
While MAG cannot hope to compete on an equal basis with private firms, it is
planning to increase compensation for extensionists at least to reduce the
gap which exists between the respective salary levels.
36.       Technical Assistance.  The project is supported by a UNDP-financed
technical assistance program for which the Bank is executing agency. Three
consultants in extension, credit, and marketing are provided for the three-year
period 197-77 by the Society for Organization, Planning and Training (GOPA)
under contract to the Bank. The consultants are assisting in the orientation
of extension work in the project area; preparation of plans for the credit
component; introduction of procedures for the supervision and collection



ANINEX 4
Page 9
of subloans; promote the coordination of the participating agencies; helping
farmers with management, marketing, and storage activities; and training
counterpart staff.
37.       While the work of the consultants generally has been quite effective,
stronger inputs from them are required in the preparation of work programs and
in training extensionists. These aspects of their work are being reinforced
in the context of the mid-term review held in early 1977.
38.       Auditing.  All participating agencies are required to have their
project accounts audited. In the case of BNF, accounts are to be audited
quarterly and general accounts annually. An annual audit, which includes a
review of the project accounts, is performed by a private auditor. The quar-
terly audit of the project accounts has not yet been undertaken, but it has
been agreed that the Superintendency of Banks will perform it. The project
accounts of the other participating agencies also have not yet been audited,
but the Ministry of Finance will undertake this work.
Project Cost
39.       The present project cost estimate of US$16.7 million is somewhat
more than 5% above the appraisal cost estimate of US$15.8 million, as shown
in the table below (amounts in US$'000).

The increase was caused primarily by the extraordinarily high rates of infla-
tion of recent years which affected construction costs in particular.  It
should be noted that costs were held down in the case of roads through a shift
to force account work and that the number of vehicles purchased was half of
the appraisal estimate. The increase in project cost will be met by an in-
crease in the Government's contribution.

Evaluation
40.       It is too early to determine project impact on production because
of the recent initiation of the lending program and the length of the develop-
ment period involved. Similarly, the infrastructure compoments are still in
the construction stage. At this point, it can only be stated that the imple-
mentation of the farm development plans and the construction of infrastructure
facilities are proceeding satisfactorily after a slow start. Project monitor-
ing and evaluation has been reviewed with the Coordinator, and a system to
determine project impact will be introduced in the context of the second
project.

PARAGUAY
SECOND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Description of Project Area
A. Location and Regional Framework
1.        The proposed Second Rural Development Project area is located in
southeastern Paraguay along the Parana river and within the administrative
boundaries of the Department of Itapua. At the southern end of the Department
lies its capital, Encarnacion, the second largest city of the country. Itapua
is distinctly agricultural in character. Its rich soils and the growing entre-
preneurial farming population in its southern half have made Itapua one of the
most important agricultural regions of the country, with approximately one-
fifth of Paraguay's crop output originating there. Agricultural development
is nevertheless uneven. The southern part of Itapua, roughly forming a
triangle between Encarnacion, San Pedro del Parana, and Pirapo, has a commer-
cially oriented farm structure into which modern technology is rapidly being
introduced, with consequent increases in productivity.
2.        The main crops of this area are soybean, rice, corn, tung oil and
wheat. Farms are usually medium sized and operated by the owners and their
families. 1/ The project area nearest Encarnacion is designated as area A
(see Map). It comprises two Institute of Rural Welfare (IBR) colonies:
Colonias Unificadas, established in 1941, and part of Colonia Frederico Chavez,
founded 10 years later. Total area and number of farm plots are as follows:
1/   Settlement of this area started in the 1920s, with a strong influx of
European immigrants, predominantly German. The most recently established
foreign colony is Pirapo, founded in the 1960s under a bilateral agree-
ment between the Paraguayan and Japanese Governments.

/1   A group of three colonies (Tacuaria, Parana
and Doctor Esculiez), which were established
separately.
The actual number of farms in these colonies, however, does not correspond to
the above figures because of a gradual process of subdivision of the original
plots.
3.        The upper part of the Department, north of Capitan Mesa, is still
mostly covered by forest. It covers an area of around 750,000 ha. Soils are
of the same high fertility as in the southern part of Itapua and agriculture
is slowly being established there. Area B, of the proposed second project,
lies within this region, a gross area of 282,500 ha running parallel to the
Parana River (see Map).
4.        The agricultural potential of Itapua far exceeds its present pro-
duction level. Not only are large areas still under forest, even in the more
densely settled south, but on-farm productivity could be improved considerably
through the adoption of modern farming techniques. Farming is carried out
through small and medium-sized family enterprises dealing mostly with cash crops.
5.        Itapua's location and relationships with the rest of Paraguay will
change considerably within the next decade. Two major developments affecting
the economic structure of the Department, and undoubtedly influencing the pro-
posed project areas, are (a) the project completing the national road (Route 6)
between Encarnacion and Pto. Pte. Stroessner, including paving of the existing
Encarnacion-Pirapo segment, and construciton of the remaining section to Pto.
Pte. Stroessner, and (b) construction of two large hydroelectrical plants on
the Parana River--Itaipu in the north and Yacyreta-Apipe in the south.
6.        When finished, the national road (Route 6) will complete the third
segment of the Plan Triangulo, connecting the existing roads between Asuncion-
Encarnacion, and Asuncion-Pto. Pte. Stroessner. The opening of this asphalted
highway will facilitate the development of over I million ha of forest land
in the Departments of Itapua, and Alto Parana, and the road's completion will
provide a link to the Brazilian market via Pto. Pte. Stroessner through which
output from the proposed project area would be channelled.



ANNEX 5
Pnge 3
7.        The two hydroelectrical plants (Itaipu and Yacyreta-Apipe) are being
developed on a bilateral basis with Brazil and Argentina. The Itaipu project
is now under construction and implementation of the Yacyreta-Apipe project
should commence during 1977/78. Both projects would affect the second rural
development project area in three main respects:
(a)  the national and regional mobilization of qualified manpower and
construction firms might create strong competition for the man-
power in the project area, resulting in an increase in labor
costs, which will affect overall project costs;
(b)  the demand for peak labor on the construction site of Yacyreta-
Apipe on the Paraguayan side could be as high as 5,000 workers,
causing a demand for agricultural products during the construc-
tion period that might affect the farming pattern in the proposed
project area; and
(c)  due to the anticipated water level changes in the Parana River,
as a result of the hydroelectric project in the Yacyreta-Apipe
area, between 800 and 1,000 farmers on lands to be flooded
will have to be resettled, and IBR intentions are to resettle
them in the northern part of Itapua.
B. Physical Features
Climate
8.        The climate of the project area can be classified as sub-tropical,
with a strong continental influence (Table 1). Summers are hot and humid and
winters are relatively dry and cool. Throughout the year, rather wide fluc-
tuations in temperature are experienced as a result of the continental
influence.
9.        Rainfall averaged 1,648 mm per year for the 1964-70 period, ranging
from 1,368 mm in a dry year, to 2,200 mm in a wet year. The wettest month is
generally December (average 992 mm) and the driest, June (Average 100 mm).
Rainy days are well distributed throughout the year, with an annual average
total of 81, an average minimum of five days per month, and an average maximum
of nine days per month. Rainfall intensity can sometimes be such that runoff
causes erosion on the steeper and unprotected slopes. Intensities of 1 mm per
minute for more than one hour are not unusual. Runoff has been estimated at
20% of rainfall.
10.       Average temperatures range from a 160 to 17 0C low in winter (June-
July-August), to a 25  to 26 C high in summer (December, January, February),



ANNEX 5
Page 4
while average minimum temperatures range from 10  to 18 C for the same seasons
(the absolute maximum temperature is 39 C in December, while the absolute mini-
mum is -3  in June or July).  Certain crops, mainly perennials, are adversely
affected by these wide temperature ranges. The relative humidity of the air
is fairly constant and only varies between 65% in summer, and 80% in winter.
11.       Night frosts occur in the coldest months of the year, mainly June,
July and August, and limit the possibilities for winter cropping (Table 1).
However, in part of the project area, along the Parana River, the frequency
of fog lengthens the frost-free period, resulting in a more favorable climate
for frost-sensitive perennials such as bananas, papaya, mangoes and pineapples.
Conditions are more favorable in this area for citrus fruits as well.
Soils
12.       The pedological surveys undertaken for the Plan Triangula show that
practically all the uplands of the project area are lalosolic. More specific-
ally, the soils are silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam; over 150 cm
deep; moderate permeability (2 to 6.4 cm per hour); and derived from basalt.
The typical soil profile has a dusky red, friable, light clay surface soil
that is moderately sticky and plastic when wet, and hard when dry. The pH
ranges from 5.8 to 6.6 under forest, and from 5.4 to 6.2 in old cultivated
areas. This well-drained upland soil is physically well adapted to many crops
and is among the best of Paraguay. This soil unit is broken in places by
similar soils with steeper slope, rarely exceeding 9%, or by narrow, wet
valleys of strongly acid clays of old alluvium, or Humic Gley soils.  In
places, small areas are covered with reddish brown laterites.
Land Capability
13.       Class II soils cover 70% of project area B, corresponding to the
upland latosols described above. The narrow, wet valleys and some low areas
are grouped in Class V and overlie 20% of the area. The remaining 5% fall
into Class III. Compared to area B, area A has a somewhat less favorable
supply of land suitable for intensive cultivation. The Colony Federico
Chavez has a preponderance of steep slopes and soils unsuitable for cultiva-
tion (Classes VI and VII) that can be used only for pasture or forest.
14.       Area A is already completely settled.  In area B, all the Class II
soils can be gradually deforested and cultivated, constituting the main area
suitable for colonization. Under present conditions, Class III, IV, and V
soils should not be deforested and cultivated, including the river banks,
thus reducing erosion. The lowlands, with hydromorphic soils, could event-
ually be developed for irrigated rice with proper flood control and drainage
works, but this would be costly and does not appear justified in the near
future. National Development Bank (BNF) and Ministry of Agriculture and



ANNEX 5
Page 5
Livestock (MAG) technicians should ensure that Class III soils and above are
not developed and that a strip of protective land 15 m wide remains on each
side of all rivers and streams. Land available for settlement in area B is
discussed further in Annex 2.
Forest Resources and Streams
15.       Covered mostly with humid, sub-tropical forest, averaging 270 trees
per hectare, project area B, because of access by the Parana River, has been
repeatedly and selectively logged for almost a century for its commerci '1 and
exportable timber (Class A), mainly cedro (Cedrela tubiflor) and lapacho
(Tabebula ipe). Due to poor forest management, however, there is now a very
limited quantity of these valuable species left. Furthermore, many of the
large trees still standing were obviously rejected during earlier harvests
because of deformed shape or suspected internal defects and have little com-
mercial value. Estimates of the remaining commercial timber therefore indi-
cate that, near the Parana River, the forest has been thoroughly exploited
for most of its marketable timber. If any usable timber is discovered during
agricultural clearing, it should be marketed or kept for on-farm use.
Topography, Water Supply and Drainage
16.       Topography.  The project area, including both areas A and B, with
the Parana River as its eastern boundary, consists mainly of gently undulating
to rolling slopes, ranging in grade from 2% to 5%. The landscape is cut by
regularly spaced narrow stream valleys, with steeper slopes up to 9% in
gradient.
17.       Water Supply and Drainage.  The entire project area is part of the
Parana River's watershed. The general direction of the Parana's flow is north-
east to southwest, and its main Paraguayan tributaries are the Pirapo, Tembey,
Guarapay, Yhaca-Guazu and Yacuy-Guazu in area B, all running parallel to one
another in northeasterly to southwesterly direction and at fairly regular
distances from each other. With the high rainfall in the area (over 1,600
mm), water supply is adequate in all areas of the proposed project. Ground-
water appears to be abundant at relatively shallow depths but definitive sur-
veys are lacking. In area B, some farm wells range in depth from 10 m to
15 m. The entire area is generally well drained through a relatively dense
network of tributaries joining the main river systems.
C. Social Infrastructure
Population and Settlement
18.       A farm survey carried out during February 1976 in both project areas
indicated that the total farm population was approximately 50,000, 22,200 of



ANNEX 5
Page 6
which were located in area A and the remainder in area B, north of Capitan
Meza. This population can be regarded as the "target group" for the project.
Although the reliability of the survey is not established, the Field Coor-
dinator estimates that 90% of the farms in area B were covered by it. In area
A, the survey covered a 10% sample of the existing farms. The above figures,
however, do not include the population living in small towns within the proj-
ect area, and the 1972 population census does not provide any additional
information on this point.
19.       In area A, there are relatively few villages within the project area.
Well-established small towns in the southern part of the Department of Itapua
such as Hohenau, Capitan Miranda and Jesus provide the necessary services for
the farming community. Area A is relatively close to the capital of the
Department, Encarnacion, and a fairly dense earth road network provides satis-
factory ground communications between rural areas and the towns.
20.       In area B, essentially an agricultural frontier, almost all the
service centers are located along the Parana River. Communication between the
the small semi-urban centers in the southern part of the area, and the south
of the Department, has been facilitated over the past few years by the con-
struction of earth roads which permit regular traffic during dry weather. The
most important of these centers are Capitan Mesa, Puerto Triunfo, Edilira,
Puerto Natalio--all on the Parana River--and Domingo Robledo, halfway between
Capitan Mesa and the Rio Tembey. Estimates of the population in these centers
vary from 8,000 to 15,000 and the number of small commercial enterprises and
local civil authorities is increasing quite rapidly.
21.       The large influx of settlers is causing rapid changes in the socio-
economic structure of the centers as they are becoming more service-oriented.
The service centers in the northern part of the project (Puerto Porvenir, Pto.
San Rafael, Pto. Carlos Antonio Lopez, and Mayor Otano) are small villages
with a restricted service radius and extremely primitive economic structures.
They are isolated from the rest of the Department and can be reached only by
boat along the Parana River. Because of their isolation, they have close
links with neighboring Argentina. The city of El Dorado, across the river
from Mayor Otano, acts as the regional service center for the sparse settle-
ments along the Paraguayan side of the Parana River. Mayor Otano is the most
important semi-urban center in the northern project area, with an estimated
population of 2,000 to 4,000 people.
Input Availability
22.       Area A, being at a more advanced stage of settlement, has a network
of basic services providing inputs to farmers. The area is within easy reach
of well established urban centers (Encarnacion, Hohenau, Obligados, Fram, and
Capitan MIiranda), which have commercial dealers trading in seed, chemicals,
farm machinery, storage and commodity processing. Little of this network is
available to settlers in area B. Capitan Meza is the largest center but pro-
vides few services. In the other settlements along the river (Domingo



ANNEX 5
Page 7
Robledo, Puerto Trifuno, Mayor Otano), small merchants provide some of the
most essential inputs.
Institutions
23.       The project area is part of the Department of Itapua, where a
Governor at Encarnacion represents the Central Government and chairs a
Regional Council for the Development of Itapua. The various ministries and
national institutions are well represented in Encarnacion but field staff are
distributed unevenly. They are particularly sparse in area B.
24.       MAG has a Regional Research Center at Capitan Miranda, with provi-
sion for a sub-center in area B. There are five extension agents (one super-
visor plus four technicians) in Encarnacion, and two technicians in Hohenau,
all near area A. These are only two technicians in all of area B (one at
Capitan Meza, and one at Puerto Triunfo).
25.       IBR has four administrators in area A and four in area B, all under
the authority of the Encarnacion office.
26.       BNF has three branches in the project area, one at Encarnacion and
one at Hohenau, both serving area A, but the Hohenau Branch has posted one
technician to Capitan Meza (area B). BNF is considering a new branch, either
at Capitan Meza or Domingo Robledo (both in area B), but a final decision on
the location will be delayed until the Second Rural Development Project gets
underway. Loans outstanding to IBR settlers as of December 31, 1975 were as
follows:

The larger loan sizes in area B probably reflect the relatively large invest-
ment going into land clearing and annual cropping on the virgin and highly
fertile, cleared forest land.
Infrastructure
27.       Area A is serviced by a reasonably adequate basic infrastructure
network. Almost all the farms are located on earth roads and there are
storage and processing facilities in the nearby towns which aid the marketing
process. The school system provides a fairly good coverage, and health
facilities (hospitals and doctors) can be reached easily. Electricity, how-
ever, is not generally available on the farms.
28.       In area B, only the southern part, between Capitan Meza and the
River Tembey, has even a rudimentary road network. There are no storage or
marketing facilities, and post-harvest losses can be high. Only about two-
thirds of the 7,000 children of school age attend school and drop-out rates
are very high. The 54 existing schools are mostly one-room, wooden structures,
inadequately equipped. Health services are insufficient to deal with the
rapid influx of settelrs. There are three health centers (Capitan Meza,



ANNEX 5
Page 9
Domingo Robledo and Mayor Otana), all understaffed, and poorly equipped.
There are three health posts providing only rudimentary services. The
doctor-to-population ratio is 1:12,500, and hospital bed to population ratio
is 1:2,000. Electricity is available only in some of the larger villages,
and then for only a few hours daily.

PARAGUAY
SECOND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
On-farm Investments under the Project
A. Medium- and Long-term Investments
General
1.        Settlers in the project area have had little access to medium- and
long-term financing or technical assistance, although farmers in area A,
longer established and with all-weather road access to nearby Encarnacion
and Hohenau, have better access than those in area B (Annex 5). The National
Development Bank (BNF) is the only credit institution providing financial
assistance to the Institute of Rural Welfare (IBR) settlers in the project
areas. Investment needs differ between area A and area B, primarily because
of the difference in the age and development stage of the settlements.
2.        Most of the small farmers cannot cultivate more than 4 or 5 ha of
their 20-ha plots because of the lack of financial resources to either clear
more land with the help of hired labor or machines or to destump the already
cleared area and work it more efficiently with draft animals or light mech-
anization. Even though the settlers work hard, most of them are locked into
a subsistence level farming situation unless they are given access to medium-
and long-term financing to help them achieve a commercial farming level.
Cutting Forest
3.        Most of the cutting is done with hand axes and saws beginning in
April-May (fall) soon after harvest. After the trees and brush are cut, they
are allowed a short period of time to dry before they are burned. After the
first burn, the remaining smaller limbs and brush are cut and piled on the
remaining trunks and stumps for additional drying and burning. This process
requires about 37 man-days/ha and costs about US$110/ha. Both axe and chain-
saw contractors are available to perform this work.
Destumping and Clearing
4.        For the first two or three years after the forest has been cut down,
it is impossible to use draft animals for tillage because of the large number
of stumps and logs criss-crossing the fields. Crop residue and regrowth are
cut, piled and burned in an attempt to get rid of remaining stumps and trunks.
The trunks that remain are aligned with the stumps or dragged off to one side.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
Such clearing is commonly accomplished by additional cutting, prying and pull-
ing, using both human and animal power. The German "Cooperative Colonas
Unidas Agr. L'tda" located at Hohenau now offers custom bulldozing of stumps
at about US$35/hr, plus transport of equipment to and from the site. Average
cost of destumping forest cut four or five years previously is US$125/ha.
Draft Animals
5.        In area B of the project, the average number of hectares cleared
per farm is 4.8, which is about the maximum amount of land a farm family can
handle manually. There is a limited number of oxen and horses being used
now but at least 60% of the farmers interviewed were interested in financing
for purchase of draft animals. A good pair of oxen presently costs US$550
to US$659 per pair and horses cost US$200 to US$300 per pair. Oxen with pro-
per care should have a working life of eight years. Sold for slaughter at the
end of their working life, they would have a salvage value of about US$200 a
pair. An additional investment would be required for animal-drawn tillage
tools and a cart, which would amount to about US$500 per beneficiary.
Permanent Pasture
6.        About I ha of permanent pasture, as well as some maize and cassava,
would be required to feed the oxen properly. Fences that would be financed
are normally four strands of barbed wire strung to native wood posts spaced
at approximately 2-meter intervals. Cost of the fencing for I ha (400 m)
would be about US$240.
Backpack Sprayers
7.        Backpack sprayers, manually or motor operated, are required if the
farmers are to protect their crops against attack by insects or disease and
fungus. Farmers suffer reduced yields annually, and complete crop loss in
some cases, because they have no way of applying, or finance to purchase, the
required chemicals. There is a large demand for sprayers. A good manually
operated backpack sprayer costs about US$60.
On-farm Storage
8.        The largest demand voiced by the farmers in area A of the project,
and to a lesser degree in area B, was for loans to build on-farm storage.
Soybean prices varied from about US$100/m ton at harvest time (late April)
to almost US$160/m ton in late August. Other crops which also show signs of
price gain if stored are tung, maize, sunflower and peanuts. On farm storage
construction costs vary from US$16 to US$20/m2.  Soybeans require about 1.5 m2
of floor space per ton of storage. Some storage is also required for holding
feed for draft animals and various other supplies. Average investment for
storage on the 20-ha farm (paras 13, 14 and 15) is expected to he about US$180.



ANNEX 6
Page 3
Alternative Investments
9.        Settlers who already have draft animals or other investments depicted
in the farm models (Section B) may want to substitute mobile threshers to be
used with soybean, maize, sunflower and beans. These units range in cost from
US$2,000 to US$3,500 and in capacity from 400 to 1,800 kg/hour. Current custom
charges for threshing in the project area is US$0.015 (2 G) per kg for maize,
with the farmer furnishing all the labor for feeding the machine and bagging
the grain. Operational costs average US$0.0027 (0.34 G) per kg or about
US$0.005 (0.650 G) per kg, including interest and depreciation, but not profit.
Current custom rates for threshing are profitable and there is a real need
for additional machines.
10.       Some sub-borrowers may wish to finance additional cutting of forest
or mechanical clearing of forest by bulldozers. Current average cost for push-
ing down standing forest and windrowing the debris is US$400/ha, requiring 10
to 12 hours of bulldozer work. Interest was also shown in borrowing for addi-
tional fencing and pasture establishment for milk cows and swine rearing.
Tractors
11.       Medium-size farmers (40 ha) in both areas A and B, who average about
8 to 12 ha of land cleared of the forest, find that they are unable to double-
crop or increase their cultivated land area without additional farm power.
They have also found that, during the critical harvest period for wheat and
sunflower and during preparation of that same land for soybeans, labor is in
short supply, thereby curtailing the amount of land that can be double-cropped.
Some farmers in area A have access to custom-hire tractors but they have exper-
ienced delays in getting work completed on a timely basis during critical
periods. Current custom rates range from US$9 to US$10 per hour for plowing
or discing. Most prospective sub-borrowers expressed their desire to purchase
45- to 65-hp diesel tractors equipped with tillage tools, planter, cultivator,
sprayer and trailer. The current prices for tractors of this size in Paraguay
range from US$11,000 to US$13,000, and matching equipment costs about US$9,000
to US$10,500 additional. Operating costs, including labor, range from US$5.50
to US$6.50 per hour. Diesel fuel is expensive in the project area, costing
about US$0.23 per liter.
Operating Costs
12.       In the first year of investment, incremental operating costs are
included in the farm loan to insure that the sub-borrower uses good quality
seed and the required pesticides, as well as other good cultural and post-
harvest practices, incuding the holding of crops for later marketing.

B. Farm Models
Model I (Small Farmers, 20 ha)
13.       This farm model is based on land ownership of 20 ha, with an average
of 4.8 ha 1/ partially cleared and farmed and the remainder in heavy forest.
Seventy percent of the farmers in area B fall into this category. Of the land
in forest, 10.2 ha could be cleared for farming, but the rest is considered to
be better left to forest because of slope, marshy condition or other adverse
physical characteristics. Over 50% of the cultivated area is in subsistence
crops of maize, cassava and beans, while soybean makes up about 75% of the
gross cash income for these farmers. Yields are low because from 15 to 25% of
the land is occupied by stumps and logs, poor quality seed is used, weed infes-
tation is severe, and practically no fertilizer, pesticide or other soil amend-
ments are applied. After investment, the farm would move up to 6.8 ha in
production, with 1 ha in pasture and 5.8 ha in crops. Oxen would be used to
till 4.8 destumped ha of which 2.5 ha would be double-cropped, giving a total
area cropped of 7.3 ha. Two additional ha of newly cut forest, with a large
amount of down timber, would be cultivated manually. Sub-borrowers would be
required to purchase good quality seed and would be provided with funds for
fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides, as conditions dictate.
14.       The farm model includes maize, cassava, beans, soybean, sunflower
and permanent pasture, but the sub-borrower would choose those which he felt
best qualified to produce and which seemed profitable under changing market
conditions.
15.       The overall average investment is expected to be about US$2,520 for
land improvement and equipment, with US$564 for incremental operating costs,
making a total of US$3,084 per sub-borrower. Full development income is not
expected until the fourth year because experience with the use of pesticides,
animal power, storage and marketing would have to be gained to realize full
benefits. The financial rate of return on this model has been estimated at
28.8% over a 12-year period (Tables 1 and 2).
Model II (Medium Farmers, 40 ha)
16.       This farm model is based on land ownership of 40 ha, with an average
of 8 ha cleared of stumps and 6 ha cut but with stumps, making a total of 14
ha farmed. The remaining 26 ha are generally covered with heavy forest, but
16 ha are considered as potential farm land. About 10% of the farms in the
project area are established as 40-ha farm units but IBR intends to allocate
more farmers of this size to encourage mechanization. Draft animals and

MAG, BNF and IBR during February 1976 at the request of the Bank.

family labor represent the major source of farm power at present. About 25 to
30% of land is in subsistence crops, with a larger, proportional area under
cash crops, compared with the previous model. Yields remain low on these
farms because of shortage of financial assistance to the farmer to purchase
proper inputs. With such assistance, these farmers would destump the 6 ha of
uncleared cut forest and secure a tractor and equipment, which would enable
them to double-crop 10 ha of cash crops and produce 4 ha of subsistence crops,
giving a total annual cropped area of 24 ha.
17.       Crops in the farm model include cassava, maize, beans, soybean,
wheat and tung, but sub-borrowers would be free to select the crops they
wished to grow, based on experience and market outlook. Financing would
cover stump clearing costs and tractor purchases as well as incremental oper-
ating expenses for the first year. Included in the financing would be funds
for good quality seed, fertilizer, pesticide, herbicide, custom combine
harvesting, fuel and repair, as well as other minor inputs.
18.       The overall average investment is about US$7,567, based on one-third
of the cost of a 45-hp tractor, with matching equipment, and the destumping of
6 ha of land, with incremental perating costs of US$2,439. There are alter-
natives for tractor ownership since most farmers do not have enough land
cleared to fully utilize available tractors. Three or more farmers could join
together to purchase a tractor, or one farmer could utilize surplus tractor
capacity by doing custom work for neighbors. Indications are that the latter
is already the practice in parts of area A and is likely to spread into area B
with the availability of appropriate finance. The overall investment would
average about US$10,006 per farm, as depicted in the model. Full production
would be achieved in the third year, one year earlier than in the previous
model, as these farmers are already oriented toward commercial agriculture.
The financial rate of return has been estimated at 19.3% over a 12-year period
(Tables 3 and 4).
Foreign Exchange
19.       Investment items for areas A and B, with their respective foreign
exchange components, are compared in Table 5.

SECOND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Rural Infrastructure and Service Investments under the Project
A. Introduction
1.        In the older settlements of Colonies Federico Chaves and Unificadas
(project area A), there is reasonably adequate infrastructure and much of the
land has been overworked. However, the strip of land about 100 km long,
bounded by the Parana River to the southeast and lying between the Manduviyu
River to the southwest and the Yacuyguazu River to the northeast (project
area B), is still for the most part covered with original forest and has only
the most rudimentary infrastructure. As the land is rainfed and very fertile,
it would be advisable to concentrate the finance available for infrastructure
investment in a part of this area rather than dissipate it over the two areas,
or even over the whole of area B, which contains in total about 520,000 ha.
The infrastructural component of the project would therefore be confined to
some 240,000 ha in area B along the Parana River and extending roughly 35 km
inland as far as the Tembey River, and 18 km to 19 km inland beyond it. This
limitation would tend to concentrate development and new settlement within the
southwestern part of area B, but it is not intended to restrict credit and
technical services to this smaller area only. Within the infrastructural
area, almost every farm would be brought within about 5 km of part of the road
network; elsewhere access would be by existing tracks, which would be improved
by equipment provided under the project.

2.        Area B has been subdivided into three zones:

SE - Parana River
NE - Yacuyguazu River
Total areas:              520,000 ha                     240,000 ha
/1   The width of area B, as now designated by Government to be developed by
the Institute of Rural Welfare (IBR), is about 60 km at the southwest
boundary and 40 km at the northeast.  Assuming about 25% of the total area
to be unsuitable for cropping, the long-term potential for agricultural
development in the whole area would be some 390,000 ha.
/2   Available farm land within the infrastructural area is about 180,000 ha.
B. Roads
Present Situation
3.        Until timber operations started some 20 years ago, area B was com-
pletely isolated. The Parana River remained the only means of access until
the 1960s, when an earth road was built to Capitan Meza, but most of the area
north of the Tembey River is still accessible only by river craft to the small
settlements along the Parana, and then by logging tracks 1/ that penetrate
1/   For classification adopted in this report, see Appendix 1.



ANNEX 7
Page 3
from 20 km to 75 km into the forest. There are upwards of 16 riverside
villages but none have even rudimentary port facilities. 1/
4.        The existing tracks fall into two categories:  (a) logging routes,
extending roughly northwestwards from the Parana River; and (b) other tracks
which have been developed by local farmers and which meander haphazardly but
predomominantly in a southwesterly to northeasterly direction. The general
alignment of the first category is, for the most part, good, but that of the
second is variable. Those in category (a) are distributed at intervals of
from 4 km to 12 km throughout the area while most of those in (b) are concen-
trated in the Southwest Zone and, to a lesser extent, close to the river
elsewhere. Except where farm land has been cleared alongside tracks of both
categories, forest clearing has been minimal and seldom exceeds the width
of the track.
5.        The southwest boundary of area B is about 84 km distant from
Encarnacion by earth roads, paved with stone in some sections, while vehicular
access to the northeastern corner is just possible in dry weather by an earth
track from Puerto Presidente Stroessner, about 100 km to the north.  This
track is intended to be improved by army engineers but only to earth standards,
and several rivers will remain unbridged.
6.        By early 1978, the realignment and asphalt paving of Route 6 from
Encarnacion to a point near Pirapo 2/ will bring the national highway system
to within 14 km of the southwest boundary of area B. Route 6 is eventually
to be extended from this point to join Route 7 at a point 37 km west of Puerto
Presidente Stroessner but no timescale or source of funds has yet been deter-
mined. However, a study funded by the Government of Brazil, which includes
aerial photography, is currently being undertaken to finalize the alignment
for this highway. As the Government of Paraguay has limited the choice of
route to a 15-km-wide strip, parallel to the Parana River and about 37 km
distant from it, this highway will run through the entire length of area B
and provide good access to that part of it which is now virtually uninhabited
and inaccessible (see Project Map).
Works Proposed
7.        The project would provide a basic network of roads along the full
length of the southeastern part of area B (Map 12550). Financing under this
component would be provided for:
1/   The only important commodity handled was logs, rolled into the river and
formed into rafts.
2/   Bank Loan 532a-PA, 1974.

(a) construction of 99 km of all-weather stone paved road, including
minor structures, to give direct access to the whole length of
area B from the termination of the realigned and asphalted
highway and running roughly parallel to the Parana River at
a distance of from 10 km to 12 km from it;
(b) construction of eight major bridges on the all-weather road;
(c) construction of 238 km of earth roads and minor structures
distributed as follows:

(d)  procurement of an earthworks unit to be allocated to the
Road Maintenance Department of the Highways Authority (DGV) to
perform two specific tasks:
(i) build and maintain the new earth road network; and
(ii) improve selected existing tracks which are not being
adopted as part of the network, but which, by improve-
ment, would supplement it; and
(e) recruitment of the services of a firm of consulting engineers
acceptable to the Bank to supervise the construction of items
(a) and (b) by contractors and to assist DGV with planning
and organizing the work of items (c) and (d) ti) above, and
with route selection and planning and organizing the work of
item (d) (ii).
Priorities
8.        To provide basic infrastructure to the largest number of farmers in
the project area as quickly as practicable, proposed development efforts would
be concentrated in those parts of area B where the greatest amount of forest
clearing has already taken place. The following priorities for the construc-
tion program have therefore been set (see Project Map):

(i) first 40 km (from end of asphalted Route 6),
including three major bridges                                1
(ii)  next 40 km, including three major bridges                    2
(iii)  final 19 km, including two major bridges                     3
B.   Earth roads and structures:
(i) 100 km in Southwest Zone: 82 km between
item A(i) and the Parana River and 18 km
west of A(i) 
(ii)  60 km in Southwest Zone west of item AM)                     2
(iii)  40 km in Northeast Zone                                      2
(iv)  17 km to complete Northeast Zone                             3
(v)  21 km to complete Central Zone                               3
Criteria and Standards
9.        Criteria for project road route selection would call for:
(a) making maximum use of existing routes where such selection
would not conflict with other criteria;
(b) providing a basic network of stone paved and earth roads
which would result in almost every farm in the area being
within about 5 km of some section of the network;
(c) providing minimum earthworks consistent with adequate drainage
of the road surface; and
(d) adopting minimal engineering and geometric standards compatible
with adequate performance for the anticipated traffic and with
the need to avoid excessive subsequent maintenance.
10.       Selection of tracks for improvement should be made on criteria
similar to those for project road selection but with one important addition:
the amount of improvement work carried out must be restricted to what can be
achieved by efficient use of the equipment without hindering the more impor-
tant maintenance task. Improvement works should therefore be planned to
start as soon as the equipment has been received and a program worked out
which would ensure commencement of proper maintenance of each section of
the new project road network as soon as construction has been completed. The
standards that would be adopted for project construction are in line with
current practices in Paraguay and are acceptable to the Bank. Full details
are given in Appendix 1.



ANNEX 7

Management and Implementation
11.       DGV is not organized to cope with major construction works by force
account and is therefore forced to depend on consultants appointed for specific
construction projects. Collaboration between DGV and the consultants for the
on-going Credit 509-PA road program is excellent, the principal reason probably
being the fact that the consultancy selected is a consortium of one foreign
and two local firms, thus combining advanced technology with essential local
knowledge and acceptability. The appointment of consultants of equivalent
caliber is considered a prerequisite for this project and, as in the case of
Credit 509-PA, assistance from the consultants with planning and organizing
construction by force account on a small scale would enable DGV to gain
valuable experience in this field.
12.       Construction of all-weather roads and structures for the project road
network would thus be undertaken by contractors selected by international
competitive bidding while the construction of earth roads, and the improvement
of existing tracks to supplement this network, could be carried out by force
account. Consulting engineers would provide DGV with a complete service for
route selection, design, planning, costing and supervision of new construction
and advise and assist with improvement and maintenance programs. Final route
selection would be subject to approval by DGV and the National Council for
Social Progress (CNPS).
13.       Existing communications in the area are so difficult that road
construction would have to commence immediately after the effective date of
the project to allow implementation of other project components. Consulting
engineers would therefore be recruited early in 1977 so that sufficient route
selection, design and contract document preparation could be completed as soon
after loan effectiveness as possible. In order to facilitate this, the
engineers' task would be handled under two separate contracts:
(a) The Design Contract for US$0.73 million, to be funded from
the Bank's Preinvestment Studies Project (587-PA); and
(b) The Supervision Contract for US$0.82 million, to be funded
by the project (Table 3).
As continuity in execution and technical responsibility is essential, the
requirements of both contracts would be combined into a single Terms of
Reference document, as outlined in Appendix 2.
Road Maintenance
14.       Construction contracts would also provide for normal maintenance
by the contractors until the final handover of each section of the works to
DGV. By DGV estimates, the current cost of maintaining earth roads varies
widely from US$237 to US$620/km, according to traffic density. An amount of
US$0.58 million has been provided for earth road maintenance under the
project.



ANNEX 7
Page 7
Costs and Disbursements
15.       The estimated baseline project cost of the road component at
September 1976 prices is US$12.6 million, including road maintenance.
Assuming adequate preinvestment design work and contract preparation, the
construction program would be completed within three years (Tables 1, 2, 3,
13, and 14).
C. Community Centers
Present Situation
16.       A small community service center operates at Domingo Robledo in the
southwest of area B, about 10 km from the Parana River. Other population
centers that have survived the decline of logging activities in area B are
located close to the river. Until preparation of the project began, Govern-
ment activity had been minimal and, consequently, departmental infrastructure
is lacking. Since officials are understandably reluctant to work in this
frontier area at all in its present undeveloped state, provision of basic
facilities and living accommodation would be essential to project implementa-
tion.
Proposed Works
17.       The project would provide two community centers in Zone B adjacent
to the proposed all weather road. The first and principal center would be
located roughly at km 38 1/ (i.e., at Domingo Robledo) and the second, near
km 98 (in the Otano area). Both would need to be built in the first year of
the project in order to facilitate implementation. Each center would have
office accommodation, conference room, warehouse, and vehicle maintenance
workshop, with power and water supply, basic office equipment, furniture, and
a radio link. Some staff housing and rest house type accommodation would
also be provided. These facilities are intended for the use of project staff
during implementation and for Government and local officials after project
completion. Project personnel, except for the Coordinator who will reside
in Asuncion and have an office in CNPS, will have offices in the two community
centers. Housing for the additional staff will also have to be provided,
1/   Km 0 would be about 78 km from Encarnacion on the realigned Route 6.



ANNEX 7
Page 8
since this is a remote area. Most of the staff can be accommodated in two
rest house type facilities associated with the two community centers but
senior staff, including the Deputy Coordinator and the MAG and IBR Chiefs,
together with married staff, will require houses. A rest house at the main
community center would contain a flat (for visiting personnel) and 26-bed
accommodation unit, with food and recreational facilities. Fourteen houses
would be provided with this center. The second center would comprise one
flat and 13-bed accommodation unit, with food and recreational facilities,
together with five houses (Table 4).
18.       So as to facilitate an early start on construction, the consulting
engineers, to be appointed by DGV for road design and contract preparation,
would also assist DGV with design of the community centers. The estimated
cost (US$0.69 million) for this assistance would be paid under the Bank's
Preinvestment Studies Project (587-PA). Construction would be by contractors
selected under local competitive bidding and supervised by DGV.
Costs
19.       The estimated baseline cost of the community centers is US$0.8
million, at September 1976 prices, and total disbursement is planned during
the first year of the project (Tables 4, 5, 13 and 14).
D. Project Coordination
20.       CNPS would coordinate the various institutions involved both at the
national and project levels. CNPS--an interministerial organization in which
IBR and BNF are also represented--was established by Presidential Decree in
1967, but did not have its own executive office until 1972. Since that date,
it has been responsible for planning and supervising the execution of an integ-
rated program of rural development in 23 public colonies in the Eje Norte and
also for supervising the execution of the IDA-assisted First Rural Development
Project. The performance of CNPS under the first project, as well as its
interministerial character, makes CNPS the most suitable Government coordina-
ting agency for the project. CNPS would appoint a Project Coordinator,
acceptable to the Bank, who would be stationed in Asuncion and would be
responsible for overall project coordination and implementation. In addition,
a Deputy Coordinator would be stationed in project area B and would be respon-
sible for coordination and supervision at the field level. He would also be
appointed with Bank approval and would report directly to the Project Coor-
dinator in Asuncion. Both coordinators would work full time on the project
(terms of reference in Appendix 3). The Bank would provide assistance for
office equipment and furniture, as well as operating costs, including vehicle
maintenance and operation, for both the Coordinator and Deputy Coordinator,
and the Farm Management Adviser, amounting to US$0.6 million (Table 6 and 13).
Part of this amount would be used for project monitoring.



ANNEX 7
Page 9
E. Vehicles
21.       Vehicles, mostly four-wheel drive jeeps, would be provided for all
staff to facilitate their work. A few van type vehicles would be included
for transporting small groups. Purchases would be made according to the
following schedule:
Project Years
Vehicles                          1        2       3      Total
Main Community Center            11       15       3        29
Second Center                     7        3       -        10
Overall Total                    18       18       3        39
Baseline costs, including purchase and oepration over three years, amount to
US$0.6 million (Tables 6, 7 and 13).  The community centers would be provided
with an equipped service workshop, together with fuel outlets, and electrical
generating plant. The service facility would be leased, on a private contrac-
tual basis, during the disbursement phase of the project. Subsequently, it
may be sold as a commercial garage.
F. Personnel
22.       As area A is established and close to the city of Encarnacion, only
4 additional technicians , 2 each for BNF and MAG, are required to service this
area. It is considered that the existing staff is sufficient to carry out most
of the additional works generated by the farm credit component for this area.
23.       Additional staff would be required for area B, since it is a newly
developing area and has insufficient available staff to meet present and
future demands for services. Provision has been made under the project to
provide 62 additional personnel costing US$0.5 million in salaries over the
three years (Tables 6, 7 and 13). It is expected that one full-time expatriate
would be required for the duration of the project to advise on farm management,
farm planning and financial analysis and the Government is seeking finance for
this appointment from UNDP (Table 6), as under the first project agreement.
Specialized equipment for IBR and MAG has also been provided under the project
(Table 7).



ANNEX 7

G. Health
Introduction
24.       According to the health status and resources in project area B, a
rural health system would be implemented to provide personal and environmental
health services to approximately 54,000 rural people within three years of
commencement of the project (see Map). The proposed rural health system is
based on previous experiences in several Latin American countries, 1/ espe-
cially the program carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Multidiscip-
linarias en Desarrollo Rural (CIMDER) in Colombia. Implementation of such a
system involves the development of methodologies in community organization,
health, manpower recruitment, training, and supervision, as well as implemen-
tation of environmental sanitation technology and its evaluation. The five
elements considered within the proposed rural health system are:
(a) community organization;
(b) personal health services;
(c) environmental sanitation program;
(d) supervision; and
(e) evaluation.
Community Organization
25.       In Paraguay, as in many Latin American countries, "mingas" 2/ build
homes and public service and agricultural works. This traditional activity
is a positive factor in area B for organizing "family health units" as the
core community organizations for the rural health system.
26.       The main functions of a "family health unit" should be to:
(a) raise funds for co-financing, with Government, the delivery
of health services and to improve food availability for
member families; and
1/   Guatemala, Venezuela, Colombia.
2/   Minga:  A task force informally organized at the request of a settler to
carry out a defined job. Usually the initiator provides food or other
compensation during the work time.



ANNEX 7
Page 11
(b) participate in community health activities such as: (i) iden-
tifying malnourished children, (ii) collecting children for
mass immunizations, (iii) constructing wells and latrines,
and (iv) providing primary health care by members, assisted
by a trained "rural health promoter" (RHP) or an "auxiliary
rural obstetrician" (ARO) (para 37).
Personal Health Services
27.       Diagnoses of diseases at  health posts or health centers show that
about 70% could be recognized by the patient himself and could be treated
simply, safely and easily. In addition, there are highly effective disease
preventive measures that can be used by non-professional personnel through
systematic home visits.
28.       The proposed rural system would stress the delivery of personal
health services by auxiliary personnel, especially at the primary health care
level, including: family planning; prenatal care; child delivery care; post-
natal care; child growth and development; nutrition and dental hygiene; control
of well-known local diseases such as anclostomiasis, anemia, diarrhea, malaria,
venereal diseases, and skin infections; first aid for burns, injuries, poison-
ings, fractures, hemorrhages, and shocks; and dental treatment, including
tooth extractions and fillings.
29.       Organization.  The quality of roads and distances involved are key
elements in the organization of personal health services in rural areas. A
scattered rural population is already in place so the health service network
must be designed for both scattered and semi-clustered patterns, as well as
future clustered patterns. This network comprises a human resource--RHPs
and AROs--and a physical resource--health posts and health centers. Manpower
in area B would be distributed as follows:
(a) An RHP for every 120 to 160 clustered rural families within
any area with a radius of 2 km;
(b) An RHP for every 60 to 100 scattered families within any
area with a radius of 3 km;
(c) An ARO for every five to seven RHPs, covering populations of
5,000 to 6,000 people;
(d) One health post managed by the ARO for every 3,500 to 6,000
people;
(e) Special service for clustered areas with more than 160 families
within any area with a 2-km radius and to families living more
than 10 km away from any other family;



ANNEX 7
Page 12
(f) For any village with not less than 5,000 people (or a potential
grnwth to 5,000 or more in four years), a six-bed health center
type D. This center would influence not less than 10,000 people,
and it would be staffed with 1.5 doctors, one general or
obstetrical nurse, four auxiliary nurses, one dental technician,
one sanitary promoter, one statistical clerk-pharmacist, one
driver, one laundryman, and one janitor-cleaner.
(g) For a rural population of not less than 15,000 people, but not
more than 30,000, a 10-bed health center type C strategically
located within the populated area. The staffing pattern of
this health facility would be two doctors, one general or
obstetrical nurse, six auxiliary nurses, one dental technician,
one laboratory and x-ray technician, one pharmacy clerk, one
statistical clerk-accounting, three sanitary promoters, one
cook, one laundryman, one driver, one janitor, and one
cleaner.
30.       The western end of area B, from the western boundary to the Tembey
River, contains 87% of the area's total population. On the basis of the
above criteria, the following network of health services would be established
(Table 8):
(a) One 10-bed health center type C, located at Domingo Robledo,
which is the most active village and 8 km away from the
proposed all-weather road. It is possible that the first
community center would also be located in this village;
(b) One six-bed health center type D, located at Capitan Meza,
which is a river port. The present timber building would be
better equipped so it could continue to function for the next
three years, by which time it would be replaced;
(c) Three existing posts, at Puerto Triunfo, km 1; Triunfo, km 30;
and Yatytay, km 16, conveniently located near the future
health center type C at Domingo Robledo. These health posts
would be fully equipped for delivering primary health care.
Besides the standard furniture provided to health posts,
basic medical and simple laboratory equipment would be pro-
vided by the project and there would be an ARO in each health
post who would be in charge of managing it, delivering primary
health care and coordinating and supervising the RHPs;
(d) Three new health posts. These would be constructed, one at
Edelira, km 3; one at Edelira, km 26; and one at Capitan tleza,
km 28. They would be fully equipped (furniture and medical
equipment) by the project; and
(e) One or more RHPs in each population cluster in the western
end of area B.



ANNEX 7
Page 13
31.       The northeastern end of area B, between the Tembey and Yacuy Rivers,
is less populated (7,583 inhabitants) than the western end, especially between
the Tembey and Guarapay Rivers, where there are no health facilities at the
present time. The proposed network of health services for this part of area B
includes (Table 9):
(a) The existing health center type D at Mayor Otano, which would
be upgraded to type C in 1981 with a capacity of 10 beds and
would serve as the referral place for the northeastern part
of area B. It would serve the people of the Mayor Otano and
Repatriacion colonies with primary health care through its
outpatient department. Six RHPs would be supervised by the
center's nursing staff. The upgrading of a type D to a
type C center implies additional construction and equipment
as well as new staff (Table 10);
(b) A new health center type D to be associated with the second
community unit near the Guarapay River on the all-weather
road to be constructed by 1981, if the incoming population
between the Tembey and Guarapay rivers reaches 10,000 people
or more by 1980; and
(c) Five new health posts, which would be located within the north-
east end according to the settlement pattern for the first two
years of the project. It is probable that three of the posts
would be located at Pto. Sn. Rafael, Ape Aime, and C/A/ Lopez.
Location of the other two would be decided in the second year
of the project. However, the population clusters already
formed in this area would have RHPs.
32.       Levels of Health Care.  The health services network would provide
primary and secondary health care at the following levels:
(a) Home Level. Each rural family would have access to primary
health care through periodic visits by the RHP to perform
preventive and curative treatments according to the program.
Local healers would continue providing traditional health
care, but, hopefully, contact with the RHP would lead to
their involvement with the health team. Subsequently, a
short training course would be used to consolidate their
role in the health system;
(b) Farm Group Level. Latrines and well construction, cooperation
in immunization campaigns, as well as development of farming
activities, would be the main focus of "family health units"
working in close coordination with health personnel; and



ANNEX 7
Page 14
(c)  Health Post or Center Level.  The rural health posts and
centers types D and C provide primary and secondary health
care by AROs, licensed nurses, and doctors, who would attend
those cases referred by RHPs for special treatment. Health
centers types D and C would provide hospital care for referred
patients.
Environmental Sanitation
33.       Excretion Disposal.  Rural people in Paraguay and in other countries
give lower priority to building latrines than wells. For health reasons--
protection of the domestic water supply--it would be logical to make the con-
struction of a latrine a prerequisite for farm credit. The idea has been
accepted by IBR and BNF. Two types could be considered: a pit privy with
concrete or wood slab, at estimated costs of US$3.96 and US$3.00, respectively,
with a wooden shelter hut, costing an additional US$12.30, or a bone hole
latrine with a larger pit and slab made of wood, at a cost of US$1.60. The
shelter hut should cost about the same as the pit privy. Wood is more
available than concrete but has a shorter life.
34.       Water Supply.  BNF farm loans can include finance for a well, when
the farmer can afford it. The method of building wells in the project area
needs to be improved to avoid contamination with surface water. A concrete
watertight cover with over 3 meters of brick wall at the top greatly decreases
water contamination but the additional cost may preclude its construction.
35.       Another alternative for clustered populations is community water-
piped fountains with "fordillas" (self-regulated faucets). Since each health
post would be fully equipped with a water-piped well, it would be feasible to
install a distribution tank to extend the water supply to neighbors, serving
up to 75 families from each faucet. The estimated cost for such a community
supply is an additional US$1,500, serving an average of 450 people.
36.       Health Education.  The potential risk of schistosomiasis and chagas
disease in area B calls for a strong health education campaign. Avoidance of
cracks in the construction of houses, periodic use of insecticides (DDT or
clordane), and mosquito nets for sleeping are basic vector control measures.
For schistosomiasis control, creek or lake water should be avoided where the
infected snail has been sighted.
Manpower Development
37.       Although the proposed services require professional health personnel,
the main effort would be aimed at developing auxiliary personnel, such as
AROs and RHPs as well as "family health units," as follows:



ANNEX 7
Page 15
(a) Auxiliary Rural Obstetrician (ARO). This is a person residing
in a rural area, between 18 and 35 years old, with six years
or more of schooling, who has been chosen by the community to be
trained to provide primary health care at the health posts or at
homes. A 23-week training program has already been proposed by
the Ministry of Public Health in Asuncion and includes community
development, environmental sanitation, maternal and child health,
communicable diseases, and simplified medicine.
(b) Rural Health Promoter (RHP). The Department of Rural Health has
begun to recruit and train malaria volunteer workers, midwives,
dental trainees, and young rural leaders for the role. A proposed
training program based on present experience in Paraguay and other
Latin American countries is described later.
38.       Criteria for recruiting, selecting and training AROs would be the
same as those used by the National Training Center for Auxiliary Nurses
(CENFAE) except that: (a) the candidate should be proposed by community
groups, instead of political leaders, in order to increase his acceptance;
and (b) the training program would be carried out locally instead of in
Asuncion. The project would finance the following basic teaching equipment:
two slide projectors; a movie projector; and office equipment, including
furniture and one typewriter. The remaining teaching aids should be provided
by the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare (MSPBS).
39.       RHPs would be trained at field level.  This means that they would
be brought to health posts or health centers only for specific training that
could not be given directly in the field. The contents of their training would
be divided into four main segments over 12 weeks, including community organiza-
tion, primary health care, health education, and activity programming.
40.       Relevant teaching material has been developed in other countries and
is available, with necessary adjustments, for transfer to Paraguay. This
means that some topics like chagas disease prevention should be added and some
local idiom used in the presentation of the material. Each RHP would have a
"health bag," equipped with basic equipment for providing primary health care.
He would also teach the family health units how to provide first aid and treat
the most common ailments in the community. Both the ARO and the RHP would be
paid a salary. The former would be paid by the MSPBS, while the latter would
be paid partially by family health units and partially by the MSPBS in the
ratio of about 1:4.



P,    6
Supervision
41.       Ihis part of the rural health system is crucial since it maintains
standards for the health services. Based on the RHPs and the ARO job descrip-
tions, the licensed nurses from the health centers would be responsible "or
implementing a work supervision plan based on the following criteria:
(a) an ARO would supervise four to seven RHPs, while one nurse
would supervise three to six AROs;
(b) supervision would take place four times per year;
(c) every supervision would follow a pre-determined schedule
of tasks and activities; and
(d) a written report would be prepared for each supervision.
A "master kit" has been developed overseas 1/ that not only allows for activity
programming by the RHP but also provides the key for supervising his activities
and for evaluating health status changes. The ARO and the nurse would be
provided with transport so they could reach all the supervised personnel;
there would be a jeep at each health center. A horse or a bicycle could be
used for family "field level" supervision.
Evaluation
42.       The use of resources for delivering health services (efficiency)
and the achievement of results according to objectives (effectiveness) are
the two basic aspects of the evaluation process. There is special interest
in evaluating training, contents, and methodologies, as well as the super-
vision plan. Evaluation would be financed directly by Government. In order
to get reliable information for evaluation, an information schedule (like
the "master kit" above) should be created, with emphasis on simplicity and
clarity.
Management
43.       The health system component of the project would be implemented by
MSPBS, in cooperation with CENFAE, and the Food and Nutrition Education
Program (PAEN). The Regional Director for MSPBS in Encarnacion would be
directly responsible for the health program, in association with the project's
two Coordinators. He would draw on the Sanitary Engineer, the Nursing Chief,
the General Manager from his office, and the Directors of the health centers
in the project area for guidance, supervision, and evaluation of the programs.
He would also set up an implementation schedule for the project.

Cost Estimates
44.       Investment costs in Paraguay are high, 5ompared with other Latin
American countries. For instance, the cost per m of construction in
Colombia is about US$97.00, whereas in Paraguay it is about US$206.00. In
checking itemized construction costs obtained from the Paraguay Chamber of
Commerce and comparing them with commercial prices in Colombia, the following
differences were found:

Timber appears to be cheap in Paraguay.  However, a door made to the same
specifications (Puerta de madera con tablero de 2x6 - 0.8 x 2.10 m) costs
US$74.94 in Paraguay and US$27.75 in Colombia, a difference factor of 2.7.
45.       Investment Costs of Area B Health Facilities.  In summary, the
health system network for project area B includes a total of eight new health
posts, one new health center type D, an existing health center at Capitan
Meza upgraded to type D standard, and two health centers upgraded from type D
to type C (one at Domingo Robledo and the other at Mayor Otano) (see Map).
The estimated cost of the total building program is US$0.64 million (Table 11).
Equipment for the health facilities would include (a) that for upgrading two
upgraded health centers from type D to C, at an estimated cost of US$85,200;
(b) that for the two new health centers (type D), at an estimated cost of
US$79,400; and (c) that for three existing health posts and eight new ones,
at a cost of US$78,500. The total investment costs for the health system
network amounts to US$0.88 million.
46.       The cost of design and contract preparation is estimated at US$64,000
and would be paid under the Bank's Preinvestment Studies Project (587-PA).
Construction would be by contractors selected under local competitive bidding
and supervised by MSPBS.



ANNEX 7

47.       Operating and Training Costs of Health Services.  Operating costs
for the health services have been calculated for the project's first three
years and they amount to US$0.21 million (Tables 11 and 12). The Government
would be required to assume these costs in the fourth year. Staff costs are
based on the proposed staffing patterns and monthly salaries outlined (Table
10). Salary costs include the proportion of salary paid by the MSPBS to the
RHPs, assuming that this proportion is 80% of a minimum monthly salary of G
4,500. The remaining 20% would be financed through funds raised by activities
of the "family health units," or by a monthly per capita contribution by
families served by the RHP, at a rate of G 5/family/month. Cost estimates for
drugs have been based on the assumption that up to 20% of hospital costs are
for drugs. The established pattern at the Encarnacion health center is that
the patient is charged approximately half of the hospital costs. 1/ This
means that at least 10% of the project's total operating costs should be
allocated for drugs. The proposed health system would expend US$2.75 per
capita on operational costs, compared with present expenditures of US$1.03 per
capita, in the rural area of Itapua. The training component for the proposed
rural health system, including technical assistance from overseas and teaching
material equipment ("health bags" and "master kits"), is estimated to cost
US$41,500 (Table 11).
48.       The "health bag" would contain equipment for first aid, baby
delivery, and reactive strips for simple laboratory tests (urine biochemical
analysis, urine culture, and glucose tests). The "master kit" contains
registration forms, maps, pencils and guidelines for primary health care.
One training course for 25 RHPs in the second year is proposed. Overseas
assistance would be provided by two professionals for two weeks at the begin-
ning of the project, to explain the details of the rural health system to
the Project Coordinators and the MSPBS Regional Director. Another two pro-
fessionals would be provided during the training course for a period of two
weeks to provide the necessary technical assistance to the team in charge of
developing the training. During the second year of the project, two addi-
tional trips by two professionals from overseas are planned during the train-
ing courses. Technical assistance in training new candidates and supervising
those already working would be provided. During the third year, one trip
per year for two professionals is planned for supervision, adjustments to
the program, and evaluation of the rural health system.
49.       The overall baseline cost of the health system component is esti-
mated to be US$1.1 million (Tables 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14).
January 21, 1977
1/   In practice, the effective payments cover about 33%.

Road Classifications and Standards
Classifications
1.        The following road classifications have been adopted for this
project:
(a)  "highway" means an asphalted paved trunk road;
(b)  "stone paved road" means an all-weather engineered road
with hand placed stone pavement to the specification locally
known as "empedrado";
(c)  "earth road" means an engineered but unsurfaced road; and
(d)  "track" means any other form of road access and includes
all existing roads in area B.
Standards
2.        The following standards, which have been agreed with DGV, would
be adopted for all project roads:

ANNEX 7
Appendix 1

3.        Culverts are to have headwalls and special attention must be given
to all aspects of drainage and erosion prevention. Continuous side drains
must be constructed wherever unrestricted natural drainage is lacking and must
be provided with adequate turn-out drains. In most sections, it should be
possible to obtain sufficient fill material for the embankment from the side
drain excavations, thus minimizing the cost of earthworks; in such cases, the
side drains would have a wide shallow "V" cross-section. Where borrowpits are
required, these should be as shallow as possible and must be drained.
4.        Stream crossing would be either vented "Irish" fords (i.e., low
level mass concrete or masonry structures vented with one or more openings
to carry the normal water flow) or 4-m-wide single lane timber bridges,
according to site conditions. Major river crossings would be 4-m-wide single
lane bridges built to the most economical design applicable to the site, using
local hardwoods or concrete or a combination of both.

Terms of Reference for Consulting Engineers
General Conditions
1.        DGV would appoint a firm of consulting engineers, acceptable to the
Bank (hereafter referred to as "the engineers"), to be responsible to the
Ministry for the design and planning of project roads, bridges and administra-
tive centers. Fees for this task would be paid from the Bank's Preinvestment
Studies Project (587-PA). The firm selected must be of good standing in Lhe
fields of design, construction and maintenance of roads, bridges and buildings
and must also possess an intimate knowledge of conditions in Paraguay. The
staff employed to work on the project would be proficient in Spanish. Experi-
ence in a similar project being executed under IDA Credit 509-PA confirms that
best results can be achieved if a consortium of foreign and local consultancy
firms is appointed; therefore, such a consortium should be used for this
project. Supervision of the construction would also be undertaken by a
consultancy consortium of a caliber equivalent to that of the firm selected
for the design task but this service would be provided from project funds.
2.        It is good standard practice for the consultancy responsible for
engineering design to also undertake supervision of the construction. There-
fore, as the two elements of the overall task would, in this case, form sepa-
rate contracts, it would be a condition of acceptance of bids for the design
element that bidders provide a written statement that they would, if required
to do so by DGV, enter into a second contract with DGV for a fair and reason-
able fee to carry out the supervision of all the works designed under the
first contract.
3.        Bidders would also enclose the following information with their
bids:
(a) an outline program for the execution of the task based on
the information given in Appendix 1;
(b) a brief outline of the methods proposed for execution of
the task and the management structure of the consortium; 1/
1/   The policy adopted by the consortium responsible for the 509-PA project
is that the foreign member firm is responsible for the design element and
the local organization for supervision of the work. This clear-cut divi-
sion of responsibility within the consortium is strongly recommended for
adoption in the new project.



ANNEX 7
Appendix 2

(c) a schedule showing the minimum number of staff to be employed
by the bidder (by categories) (a) in the field, and (b) in the
office; and
(d) a schedule listing the minimum equipment, vehicles, site office
accommodation, and such to be provided by the bidder.
4.        Every effort must be made by the engineers to achieve early comple-
tion of the contract documents for the first works to be executed so that
construction can start immediately after the effective date for the project,
hopefully about September 1977.
The Design Task
5.        DGV would supply the following documents to the engineers at the
time of their appointment:
(a) one complete set of 1:50,000 scale maps of the project area
(based on 1965 aerial photography);
(b) any more recent relevant aerial photography of the area which
may be available (e.g., from an aerial survey for Route 6 in
1976 or from other sources);
(c) copies of project map, satellite photography, and appropriate
material from the appraisal report; 1/ and
(d) any other relevant official documents that would assist the
engineers in the performance of their task.
6.        Terms of reference for the engineers would require that they:
(a) study all the available documents and familiarize themselves
with the project area by site inspections;
(b) undertake preliminary survey of the best routes for the project
roads, following the approximate alignments indicated in the
appraisal report, and come to agreement with DGV, CNPS and IBR
on final selection;
(c) undertake the minimum amount of soils investigation necessary
to satisfy the design requirements and establish the most
economic sources of road stone for the all-weather road;
1/   To be issued to DGV by the Bank (at yellow cover stage).



ANNEX 7
Appendix 2

(d) complete survey, design, specifications, working drawings,
schedule, and cost estimates for the road, culvert, and
bridgeworks;
(e) select and come to agreement with DGV, CNPS and IBR on sites
for both administrative centers;
(f) carry out surveys of the selected sites and assist DGV with
the designs, specifications, and costing of these facilities
in any way necessary to ensure that construction of both
centers (at km 38 and km 98) can be commenced immediately
after the project becomes effective;
(g)  prepare all necessary documents to enable DGV to call for inter-
national competitive bids for the construction of bridges, cul-
verts, and roads and similar documents for the construction of
administrative centers by local contract and assist DGV with
bid evaluation and contractor selection for all these works;
(h) prepare time and expenditure schedules for the execution of the
construction program;
(i) assist the Road Maintenance Department of DGV with the prepara-
tion and execution of an improvement program for existing earth
roads in the project area, with particular attention to (a) prior-
ities, (b) the need to ensure that the work undertaken under this
program supplements but does not conflict with the proposed proj-
ect road network, and (c) the capacity of the department to
undertake this program without reducing its capability to
properly maintain the new road network as it is completed; and
(j) prepare quarterly progress reports to be submitted to DGV, the
Project Coordinator, and the Bank, the first report being due
three months after appointment of the engineers. These reports
should be brief but comprehensive and must include (i) itemized
physical progress to date, (ii) updated time schedule for com-
pletion of task, (iii) particulars of any changes to the project
which have been made or are being proposed, and (iv) comment on
any problems identified or foreseen.
The Supervision Task
7.        Terms of reference for engineers performing supervision would
require them to:



ANNEX 7
Appendix 2
Page 4
(a)  supoly to DGV and to appointed contractors throughout the
construction and maintenance periods such additional specifica-
tions, drawings, schedules and instructions as may be necessary
for the proper execution of the works;
(b) ensure that contractors employed on works comply with the
specifications and conditions of contract in all respects but
particularly with regard to the quality of workmanship and
materials used;
(c) assist DGV and contractors to plan the work efficiently, with
special reference to the objects and priorities of the program;
(d) check all claims for payment made by contractors and certify
the correctness of each claim with regard to both quantity
and value of work done;
(e) certify satisfactory completion of each section of work as it
occurs and arrange for the proper handover of completed work by
the contractors to the responsible Ministry or authiority;
(f) prepare a road maintenance program for the new road network and
assist the Maintenance Department to organize effective imple-
mentation;
(g) continue to assist DGV with the improvement of other roads in
the project area; and
(h)  prepare quarterly progress reports to be submitted to DGV, to
the Project Coordinator, and to the Bank, the first report
being due three months after apointment of the engineers.
These reports would be brief but comprehensive and include
(i) itemized physical progress and expenditures to date,
(ii) updated time and expenditure schedules for program
completion, (iii) particulars of any changes to the project
content which have been made or are being proposed, (iv) com-
ments on any problems identified or foreseen, and (v) comments
on the performance of contractors.

SECOND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Production, Prices and Marketing of Farm Commodities under the Project
General
1.        The proposed project would improve existing roads and construct new
ones to benefit some 5,000 farm families already living in project area B.
In addition, improved access would spur rapid settlement in presently isolated
tracts (mostly north of the Tembey River). The number of families settled
would increase about 2,800 by 1989 and incremental production generated from
the new farms would be mainly annual crops. By year 12, this increased produc-
tion would reach an estimated 12,000 tons of cassava, 6,000 tons of soybeans,
5,000 tons of maize, 1,000 tons of sunflower, and 1,000 tons of beans.
2.        About 2,700 small (20 ha) and 270 medium (40 ha) farmers in area B
and 370 small and 230 medium farmers in area A would receive additional bene-
fits from credit for on-farm investments and incremental working capital.
Incremental production generated from these investments would also be mainly
from soybeans (19,000 tons), sunflower (10,000 tons), wheat (6,000 tons),
cassava (3,000 tons), and beans (300 tons).
3.        In addition, all farmers affected by the project would produce some
tung, tobacco, vegetables, rice, cotton and linseed under the project. Incre-
mental production as a percent of national output in 1975 would be about 10%
soybeans, 2% maize, 1% cassava, 2% beans and 24% wheat, valued at US$6.6 mil-
lion at present prices. Soybeans, tung, linseed and tobacco would be mostly
for export, while production of other commodities would be mainly for domestic
consumption.
Crops
4.        Commodities appearing in the farm models are cassava, maize, beans,
soybeans, sunflower, wheat and tung, but others such as groundnuts, rice,
oranges, tobacco and vegetables would also be produced. Present yields are
low for all crops in the project area, considering the fertility of the soil
and the high rainfall, the main reasons being the poor quality of seed used;
the low level use of pesticides, herbicides, fertilizer and other soil amend-
ments; and the inability of the farm family to perform necessary cultural
practices in a timely fashion, as well as the farmers' general lack of knowl-
edge of modern farming practices.



ANNEX 9
Page 2
Production and Prices
5.        Cassava.  Cassava is grown principally as a subsistence crop in the
project area. The annual consumption per farm family is estimated at 400 kg
annually, and, where oxen are owned, another 1,400 kg per pair is required.
Cassava is usually planted in late August or September, using pieces of plants
from the farmer's own carryover. Yields range from 12 to 14 tons/ha over a
nine- to 12-month growing period, but they could reach over 20 tons/ha if
tubers were left in the ground through two growing seasons. Digging, however,
starts early to meet family and farm needs. Farmgate prices range from
US$15.80 to US$8.30/m ton. Additional annual production from the project at
full production would be about 14,000 tons, of which approximately 7,000 tons
would be used for farm family and livestock consumption.
6.        Maize.  Maize is the second most important food crop after cassava,
with more than 90% of the annual production consumed on the farm. It is esti-
mated that a farm family eats about 360 kg annually and a pair of oxen,
another 360 kg. The 10% that is exported goes to Brazil as Argentina is now
closed to most of Paraguay's agricultural products. Yields range from 1 to
1.8 m tons/ha and farmgate prices are between US$50 and US$68/ton. Prices
improve rapidly two or three months after harvest but are never high enough
to cover full production costs. Maize production would go down on farms
receiving credit under the project, as land would be put into cash crops that
would give the farmer a better return for his labor, space and investment;
nevertheless, overall project production of maize would increase to 5,000
tons by year 12.
7.        Beans.  The bean is another of the three basic subsistence crops,
with family consumption estimated at 360 kg annually. Beans can be grown in
at least two different periods and can be used as a short season, double crop
with msot of the others raised in Paraguay. Yields range from 0.8 to 1.2 m
tons/ha. With improved seeds for the local brown bean, the Brazilian feijao,
or black beans, higher yields than those projected, should be easily obtained.
Because of export demand in other South American countries, the short growing
season required, and the potential for high yields, beans should be encouraged
under the project as another cash crop. Current farmgate prices range from
US$150 to US$167/m ton.
8.        Soybeans.  Soybeans are the most important cash crop in Paraguay and
national production has almost doubled since the on-going Small Farmer Credit
and Rural Development Project (509-PA) was appraised in 1973. Annual produc-
tion from 150,200 ha reached 220,000 tons in 1975, with the national average
yield reaching 1,465 kg/ha. The best planting time for soybeans is the last
half of November and the first half of December, with harvest in late March
and April. The crop is harvested by hand and threshed by portable engine-
driven machines. The Galaxia variety (120-day cycle) produced between 3,000
and 3,500 kg/ha in the Japanese research station at Pirapo, while the longer
maturing varieties such as Santa Rosa and Visoja (150-day cycle) already
average 3,000 kg/ha on the better farms under favorable climatic conditions.



ANNEX 9
Page 3
9.        The additional annual yield at full production under the proposed
project is expected to be 18,000 tons, or a 9% increase over the 1975 figures,
with beneficiaries required to purchase good quality seed and innoculant for
the seed. Farmgate prices in 1976 ranged from US$111/ton at harvest (late
April) to US$135/m tons for on-farm stored soybeans sold in late August.
Paraguay prices for soybeans closely parallel world market prices and Bank
projections indicate a steady rise in the world market. The corresponding
Paraguay farmgate price for soybeans in 1985, using Bank projections, would
be US$225 per ton.
10.       Sunflower.  Sunflower as a commercial crop is relatively new to
Paraguay, with most production in the Department of Itapua where the project
would be located. Planting have increased from 1,000 ha in 1972 to 2,500 ha
in 1975 and yields range from I to 2 tons/ha. The supply of seed has been
limited and much of the increase has come from farmers holding back some of
their produce each year for planting. As a result, yields vary considerably
and some farmers have reported complete crop failures because of poor germi-
nation. Most farmers plant sunflowers as a single annual crop because it
helps spread peak labor demand and generates produce marketable in January,
some three or four months ahead of soybeans. Sunflowers can be planted during
July and in the first two weeks of August for harvest from mid-November to
mid-December. Farmers with adequate farm power are achieving good results
from double-cropping sunflowers with soybeans. Farmgate prices in 1976 ranged
from US$90 to US$100 per ton in project area B. At full production, the
project would yield an additional 7,700 tons of sunflower seeds, with an
expected farmgate price of US$119/ton.
11.       Wheat.  As wheat accounts for the largest volume of food imports into
Paraguay the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG) for several years
has promoted increased production of the crop. Yields are affected by weather
conditions, particularly those conducive to the spread of fungus and other
diseases and production has ranged from 45,500 tons in 1971 to 13,000 tons in
1973, to 20,000 tons in 1975. National yields have varied from 551 tons/ha to
1,200 tons/ha. The variety El Pato averages 2,000 to 2,200 kg/ha at the
pirapo research station, and at the Capitan Miranda Experiment station a
program is under way to select and breed the varieties best suited for condi-
tions in southern Paraguay. The most promising are Itapua 1, yielding just
under 2,500 kg/ha, and Itapua 2, yielding about 3,000 kg/ha. Under the
project, the increase at full production in 1984 would be about 4,200 tons.
The Government set the price in 1976 at US$162.70 per ton.
Marketing
12.       Farmers in Paraguay sell their produce mainly to intermediary buyers
and, to a lesser extent, to cooperatives and Government agencies. In the
project area, produce is sold primarily to merchants or truckers, who come to



ANNEX 9
Page 4
the farm to buy directly from the producers. Most of the production is sold
at harvest time as the farmer needs the money and has little or no storage
capacity. Occasionally, farmers who have excess storage will buy from neigh-
bors. Also, a few local merchants will give merchandise in kind for crops
such as soybeans, sunflower, beans, peanuts or tung. The merchant and the
farmer then arrange for transportation to Encarnacion when they have enough
for a load, or sell to higher volume merchants who come to the area.
13.       Marketing conditions in project areas A and B differ considerably
because of the proximity of area A to, and the remoteness of area B from,
Encarnacion, the principal trade center for the region. In addition, area A
is adjacent to an all-weather road, while the southern end of area B has 60
to 100 km of dirt roads that are impassable in wet weather. As a result,
farmgate prices received by producers in the southern part of area B are
US$15 to US$17.50/ton lower than in area A. The middle and northern parts
of area B do not have any road access to Encarnacion so the farmers there
must send their products by boat, which requires considerable handling and,
again, reduced revenues. This situation has made it difficult to interest
farmers in planting cash crops such as soybeans and sunflowers.
14.       With more and better roads in area B, transportation would be less
expensive and buyers would have better access to producers, resulting in
higher farmgate prices because of the reduced transport cost and increased
competition among buyers. In addition, on-farm storage financed under the
project would help to reduce after-harvest losses and enable producers to
wait for better post-harvest prices.
15.       No marketing problems are expected for cassava, maize, beans and
other domestically consumed crops since project output would represent only
a relatively small proportion of projected 1990 demand. Production of soy-
beans, tung, and sunflower would find outlets in world markets. No market-
ing problems are envisaged for these crops also because of projected favorable
world market demand for these commodities, and the country's comparatively low
cost of production.

SECOND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Economic Rates of Return
1.        While an overall economic rate of return was calculated for the
project, individual economic rates of return were also estimated for the
overall sub-project in area A, the overall sub-project in area B, and both
credit components of the project. Key assumptions and adjustments which were
used in calculating these rates of return follow:
Overall Project
(a) Taxes, in all cases, are considered as transfer payments
and are, therefore, excluded in the economic rate of
return calculations. No Government subsidies are involved
under the project;
(b) Since no shadow rate of exchange has been calculated for
Paraguay, the official commercial selling rate of the
dollar for new guaranies is used;
(c) Financial wages on farms equal shadow wage rates since
rural unemployment is very low in the project area;
(d) Administrative, technical assistance, and health services
costs, as well as pre-investment costs, are charged to the
project; and
(e) Savings in transport costs have been considered in estimating
project benefits.
Credit Component
(a) The prices of all investment and operating cost items in
constant guaranies converted into dollars in September 1976
prices would remain unchanged throughout the life of the
project; and
(b) The prices of sunflower seed, beans and cassava in constant
guaranies converted into dollars in September 1976 prices would
remain unchanged throughout the life of the project, while
the prices of wheat, maize, and soybean are assumed to follow
the projections given by the Bank's Commodities and Export
Projections Division.

2.        The farm credit component and overall sub-project rates of return
were tested for their sentisitivity to changes in crop yields and produce
prices, as well as civil works and equipment costs, in the areas of influence
(Tables 1 to 4). The economic rates of return under these assumptions are
summarized below:
