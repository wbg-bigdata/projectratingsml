would have a line of credit for financing priority
projects; (b) strengthening the Board through
technical assistancet and (c) providing technical
assistance and training to town panchayats.
EEHRC: This component would: (a) assist in the
reconstruction of houses damaged in the August 1988
earthquake; and (b) provide longer term technical
assistance to (i) mitigate the effects of future
disasters; (ii) improve building construction
techniques; and (iii) develop a housing strategy.
Onlending Terms    : MDC: Government to the Board:  3Z p.a. over 25 years
including five years' grace period. The Board to
town panchayats: (a) for social infrastructure
projects, at 8% p.a. for a maximum of 18 ye-ars
including a maximum grace period of three years; (b)
for revenue-generating projects, at 12% p.a. for a
maximum of 12 years including a maximum grace period
of two years.
EEHRC: Government would pass on the proceeds of the
credit to two commercial banks (Nepal Bank, Ltd. and

The banks would onlend, nominally, at 19? but require
borrowers to repay only at 12, 102 and 15Z depending
on loan size. The interest differential would be
paid to the banks by Government from its budgetary
resources.

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR A MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT AND EARTHQUAKE
EMERGENCY HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
1.       The  following  memorandum   and   recommendation  on  a  proposed
development  credit  to  Nepal  for   SDR  30.9  million  (US$41.5  million
equivalent) is submitted for  approval.    The  proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity, and would help finance two
distinct streams of  investments:    (a)  a municipal development component
(MDC); and (b) an earthquake emergency housing reconstruction component
(EEHRC). The MDC was appraised in June 1988 as an independent project.
The EEHRC was appraised in October 1988, and it was determined that a
timely response to the earthquake emergency could best be achieved through
appending the EEHRC  to  the  municipal  development  project.   Hence, the
combined project has  two  orientations.    However,  one ministry would be
responsible  for  coordinating  both   components.  The  project  would  be
cofinanced by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) which will
provide US$5.1 million, and the German Agency for Technical Cooperation
(GTZ), about US$1.7 million, both through grants.
2.       Urban Sector Backgriund.  Nepal's  urban  population  i3 about 1.6
million, approximately 102 of total population, and is growing at about 4%
per year.   His  Majesty's  Government  of  Nepal  (HMGN) acknowledges that
achieving even minimum levels of service provision in the country's 33 town
panchayats (municipalities) will require a scale of investment considerably
greater  than  heretofore,  together   with  major  improvements  in  urban
administration. Local governments have long been starved of investment
funds (HMGN grants have been reduced by 102 in nominal terms over the last
five years); the towns have also lacked the administrative, technical, and
financial capacity necessary to cope with rapidly increasing demands on
public services.   An  additional  factor  bearing  on  urban management is
HMGN's current commitment to promoting the decentralization of planning and
development  functions  from   central   ministries   to  lower  levels  of
government. HMGN has accepted that implementing and sustaining a crelible
investment program within the decentralization framework would require
that, as a necessary first step, the management, finances and operations of
the town panchayats be strengthened; only  then,  will tney be able to make
good use of new capital inputs.   Accordingly, HMGN has adopted an approach
which gives immediate emphasis to management strengthening in the towns.
This approach proceeds from the assumption that while structural matters
such as town finance legislation and the division of responsibilities
between central and local governments need to be addressed over time,
significant improvements in managerial performance can be achieved in the
short term through a targeted program of technical assistance and training.
Support for such a program has been provided over the past three years by
UNDP under two phases of the UNDP--financed/World Bank-executed project



- 2 -
(NEP/85/010  and  NEP/86/021);  this  project   aims  to  assist  the  town
panchayats deliver and maintain municipal services within the constraints
imposed by their current financial and management resources; to improve
local financial management and revenite generation; to formulate the
institutional and financial framework necessary to justify a subsequent
physical  investment  program;   and   to   develop  the  investment  plans
themselves.    Results  to  date  have  been  impressive,  and  significauc
improvements in resource mobilization, operating efficiency and revenue
utilization have been demonstrated at the town panchayat level. At the
central level, legislative changes have been incorporated in the Bill of
Amendment to Townt Panchayat Act 2019 to revise outdated local tax rates,
eliminate confusion in the existing legislation, and revamp the structure
of town  government  finances.    The  Bill  was  endorsed  oy the National
Assembly in August 1987, and signed by His Majesty the King in October
1987.
3.       Earthquake Emergency Background.   An  earthquake measuring 6.7 on
the Rict.ter scale struck parts of Central and Eastern Nepal on August 21,
1988. Over 720 persons died and extensive damage, estimated at NRs 4.2
billion (US$170 million), occurred to housing, schools, hospitals, public
buildings, roads an.d bridges.   HMGN mounted a relief operation coordinated
by the Ministry for Housing and Physical Planning (MHPP). It included care
for the injured, NRs 2,000 for a death, NRs 1,000 for loss of a house,
plastic sheets for emergency shelter, cloth and 40 kg of rice per family.
This phase has now been completed; the reconstruction phase has commenced
on the basis of a comprehensive earthquake reconstruction program. HMGN
requested support from the donor community, including road reconstruction
from the Asian Development Bank.   In addition to this earthquake emergency
component for housing--the sector which suffered the heaviest damage under
the earthquake--IDA is considering a Government request for reallocating
funds under the Primary Education Project (Credit 1463-NEP) for the repair
and reconstruction of schools.
4.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The proposed municipal develonment
component would represent a logical evolution from IDA's initial focus in
infrastructure operations on a single organization dealing with specific
subsectors (water supply and transportation) to a broader emphasis on
sector policy and public administration  issues.   IDA has been building on
its role as a catalyst for change and as a technical resource in munii. )al
wanagement and infrastructure development in Nepal through sector work,
project preparation and execution of the UNDP-financed project. IDA is
therefore well positioned to assist HMGN in expandi-g the current town
panchayat development initiative.  The  project would al   build upon three
areas of development policy which the first structural adjustment loan has
emphasized as crucial--the rationalization of investment programming, the
mobilization  of   local   resources,   and   the   improvement  of  public
administration. For the EEHRC, HMGN requested IDA for emergency assistance
following the August 1988  earthquake.    The proposed earthquake emergency
housing reconstruction component was appraised in October 1988 at the
request of HMGN, for emergency assistance.



- 3 -
5.       Pro4!ct Objectives.  The MDC  would  draw on the experience of the
UNDP-financed/World Bank-executed project and would support the effective
planning,  delivery,  and  maintenance   of  infrastructure  and  municipal
services in town panchayats. It would (a) establish (as a pilot operation)
the Town Development Fund Board (the Board), to provide town panchayats
with  direct  access  to  long-term   loan  finance  in  support  of  their
development plans and programs  in  accordance with HMGN's decentralization
policy and its Basic Needs Programme; and (b) strengthen the town
panchayats technical, financial and institutional capacity to plan,
implement  and  manage  their   projects  and  services  through  technical
assistance and training.  The EEHRC would:   (a) assist HMGN in its program
to  reconstruct  housing  damaged   during   the  earthquake;  (b)  improve
construction standards and develop earthquake resistant features for
incorporation  in  buildings  through   planning  and  development  control
regulations; (c) provide technical assistance and training for the housing
sectcr to address longer term needs; and (d) addre_.s the environmental
impact relating to the excessive use of timber in buildings and building
products manufacture.
6.       Project Description.  The MDC  would include: (a) the financing of
the establishment and management costs of the Board during the first three
years of operations; (b) a US$11.1 million line of credit to the Board for
financing priority social infrastructure and revenue-generating projects in
eligible town panchayats; (c) about US$1.7 million grant to the Board for
technical  assistance  and   demonstration   civil   works;  (d)  technical
assistance and training to develop the Board's operations and procedures;
(e) equipment for the Board; and (f) technical assistance and training for
MPLD, MHPP and the  town  panchayats.    The  Board will be responsible for
appraising and approving projects on the basis of technical, financial,
economic and environmental criteria agreed with IDA. Investments worth
about US$15.0 million which are potentially suitable for loan financing
have already been identified by the town panchayats. Ten town panchayats
presently meet the finan .al eligibility test to quallfy for loans. Town
panchayats would be required to provide the necessary land plus at least
1O2 cash cortribution  from  their  own  resources.    The component, to be
carried out over eight years, provides funds for civil works, equipment and
materials, consultant services and  the  establishment and management costs
of the Board for the first three years. The total cost of MDC is estimated
at US$17.8 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$10.2
million (57Z).
7.       The EEHRC would  include:    (a)  training  for about 300 contract
staff to facilitate house reconstruction of affected households; (b) house
reconstruction loans estimated at NRs 710.0 mJllion (US$29.1 million); (c)
42 demonstration houses, which will show elementary earthquake resistant
features;  (d)  support   for   non-government  organizations  (NGOs);  (e)
production of building materials; (f) grants for low cost sanitation and
improved stoves; (g) project management costs; and (h) longer term
technical  assistance  and  training  to:    (i)  mitigate  the  effects of
earthquake and other natural disasters; (ii) prepare a national building
code  incorporating  earthquake   resistant   features;   (iii)  carry  out
epicentral and seismic mapping; (iv) develop a housing strategy; (v)



- 4 -
develop new building products; (vi) study alternatives to timber in
buildings and building products; and (vii) prepare a housing sector
project. The house reconstruction loan facility would be sufficient for:
(a) 63,000 loans in rural areas with an average size of NRs 8.600; (b) 410
loans in District Headquarters with an average loan size of NRs 18,000; and
(c) 2,340 loans for urban areas with an average loan size of NPs 40,000.
The loan ceilings would be NRs 10,000, NRs 20,000 and NRs 50,000 for rural,
District Headquarters  and  urban  areas,  respectively.    The Ministry of
Finance would pass the proceeds of the credit to. two commercial banks
(Nepal  Bank,  Ltd.  and   Rastriya   Banijya  Bank)  and  the  Agriculture
Development Bank  at  142  p.a.    The  baniks  would,  nominally, onlend to
affected households at their prevailing interest rate for this type of
operation. currently 19Z.   The  repayment  terms to affected householders,
however, would be: (a) the first NRs 5,000 at 1I interest p.a., the second
NRs 5,000 at 102 interest p.a.  and  amounts above NRs 10,000 to NRs 50,000
at 152 p.a.  Repayments  would  be  spread  over eight years with two years
grace on repayment of principal  and  interest  on the first NRs 5,000, and
two years grace on principal only  above  NRs 5,000.   The government would
pay the interest differential  to  the  banks from its budgetary resources.
Retroactive financing not exceeding  US$6.2  million,  or 20? of the credit
allocated to this component,  from  November  1,  1988 is recommended.  The
total cost of EEHRC is estimated at US$37.0 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$11.8 million (321).
8.       A breakdown of costs and the financing plans for MDC and EEHRC are
shown  in  Schedule  A.    Amounts   and  methods  of  procuremeu4t  and  of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Nepal are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is
also  attached.    The   Staff   Appraisal   Report,  No.  7413-NEP,  dated
February 1, 1989, is being distributed concurrently.
9.       Agreed Actions/Conditions.  HMGN has established the Board through
a Formation Order under the Development Board Act 2013, making it a
corporate  body  with  financial   and   legal  autonomty.    Conditions  of
effectiveness for MDC would be: (a) approval of the Board's General Policy
Statement and Rules and Regulations; (b) appointment of an Executive
Director of the Board; (c) authorization or ratification of a subsidiary
loan agreement between HMGN and the Board; (d) appointment of a cadre of
staff of the Board; (e) effectiveness of the GTZ Agreement; (f) signature
of two Project Documents Detween HMGN and UNDP for the provision of
technical assistance and training to: (i) the Board; and (ii) MPLD, MHPP
and the town panchayats; (g) retention of consultants for the above
mentioned technical assistance and training; and (h) payment of NRs 5
million  equity  contribution  to  the   Board  by  HMGN.    Conditions  of
effectiveness for EEHRC would be: (a) HMGN entering into financial
agreements with the three banks making housing reconstruction loans; and
(b) signature of two Project Documents between HMGN and UNDP for (i) the
provision of the services of a program advisor to MHPP; and (ii) the longer
term technical assistance requirements to mitigate, inter alia, the adverse
effects of natural disasters.



10.      Benefits.  For MDC, three types of benefits are anticipated: those
accruing from infrastructural investment, those accruing from _nst- tional
reform,  and those deriving from  the  private sector.  Though difficult to
quantify, relatively high economic returns are expected from the investment
components, with substantial commercial, environmental and health benefits.
Experience  with  similar  municipal   projects  elsewhere  in  the  Region
indicates that ERRs of about 244 and 182 can be estimated for road and
drainage improvement  schemes  respectively.    The  establishment of sound
fiscal and management discipline and the improved operation/maintenance of
physical assets will enhance the value of existing and planned investments,
contribute to local autonomy and decision making, and lessen the town
panchayats' demands on scarce central  government  resources.  The MDC will
also  support  and   develop   local   consultants'   capability  in  urban
development.      The   EEHRC    will   help   affected   householders   to
reconstruct/rehabilitate their homes.    The  loan  component will directly
benefit  about  460,000  persons,  of  whom  about  370,000,  or  80?,  are
classified as poor.    The  other  components  of  EEHRC  will confer also,
indirectly, benefits to the  poor.    Initiatives to introduce new building
products and Leduce the use of timber in buildings, building products
manufaccure and domestic use will slow down deforestation and thus improve
the environment. The economic benefits of EEHRC, although not calculated,
are likely to be substantial.
11.      Risks.  The major risks of  MDC  relate to a possible lessening of
HMGN commitment to pursuing the performance-oriented strategy implicit in
the component, and to the pervasive difficulty of recruiting and retaining
qualified staff  at  the  Board.    The  establishment  of  eligibility and
appraisal criteria, and guidelines for project financing together with
supervision by IDA, strong technical assistance support, and systematic
provision of training should minimize the first risk. IDA support for the
establishment and management of the Board through t a first three years of
its operations would minimize the second risk.   The main risk of EEHRC  is
the potential for default on loan repayment, especially loans to rural
households, which cannot be  minimized.    HMGN  would  set up a reserve to
cover possible defeults on these loans.
12.      Recommendation.  I  am  satisfied  that  the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asuociation and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
