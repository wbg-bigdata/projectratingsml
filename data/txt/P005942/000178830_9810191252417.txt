I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Argentina and Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales
Sociedad del Estado (YPF), a fully owned Government oil compaay and the
largest enterprise in Argentina, have requested a Bank loan of USq200 million
to finance YPF's proposed Refinery Conversion Scheme and relaLed investments.
The main objective of the Scheme is (i) to redress the imbalance in the
product slate of YPF's two main refineries--La Plata and Lujan de Cuyo (see
Map IBRD-15312)--by converting the surplus residual fuel oil, a heavy petro-
leum product, into higher value light and middle distillates which are in
deficit in the country, and (ii) help bring the supply and demand of light and
*        heavy distillates in Argentina into better balance. The current fuel oil
surplus is expected to increase further in the future as Argentina increasingly
substitutes many current uses of fuel oil with natural gas, thus reducing the
large quantity of associated gas currently being flared (about 350 million cu
ft/day in 1979 approximately equivalent to 58,000 barrels of oil per day).
With the steep increases in crude oil prices since 1973, a higher conversion
of crude to more valuable lighter products has assumed still greater importance
all over the world as discussed in "Background Paper on Petroleum Refining in
Developing Countries," dated July 17, 1980.
1.02      The Project will include, in addition to the Refinery Conversion
Scheme, the following four components: (i) a Plant Operations Improvement
Program (POIP); (ii) a Financial Management Improvement Program (FMIP);
(iii) a Training Program; and (iv) an Industrial Energy Audit. Except for the
Industrial Energy Audit which would be carried out under the auspices of the
Secretariat of Fuels, all the other components of the Project relate to YPF.
Total financing required for the Project is estimated at approximately US$878
million, including US$439 million in foreign exchange. The proposed Bank
loan of US$200 million includes US$175 million for the Refinery Conversion
Scheme with the rest for the other four components. The proposed improvement
programs for YPF aim at upgrading the financial management and accounting
systems as well as improving the operational efficiency of the existing
refineries at La Plata and Lujan de Cuyo with special reference to energy
conservation and pollution control. The Training Program will be geared to
meet the needs of the improvement programs as well as the requirements of the
proposed Refinery Conversion Scheme. The Industrial Energy Audit will review
the scope and potential for energy conservation in selected industrial
enterprises.
1.03      The proposed loan will be the second Bank operation with YPF.  The
first loan (US$27 million) was for an Oil and Gas Engineering Project 1/ (Report
No. P-2745-AR, June 4, 1980) whose primary objectives are to: (i) improve
information on countrywide oil and gas reserves as a basis for a rational
program of field development; (ii) assist YPF in locating favorable geological
hydrocarbon structures; and (iii) study the optimum development and utilization
of natural gas primarily to avoid waste and to determine related investment
requirements. The proposed second loan to YPF fits well into the country's
overall objective of developing its hydrocarbon resources.
1/ Which became effective on December 2, 1980.



1.04      The Government and YPF approached the Bank in early 1980 to
finance the Project. Subsequently, an identification mission consisting of
Messrs. E. Segura, E. Tortorelli and Ms. P. Urbano visited Argentina in Mlarch
1980, followed by a preappraisal mission in June. The Project was appraised in
October 1980 by a mission consisting of Messrs. Y. T. Shetty (Chief), E. Segura,
N. C. Krishnamurthy, A. McNamara and Ms. P. Urbano, all of the Industrial
Projects Department.
II. INDUSTRY AND HYDROCARBON SECTORS
A.   Industrial Development
2.01      Argentina is a semi-industrialized country with a per capita income
of about US$2,300 in 1979, fairly evenly distributed. Post-war growth of
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) averaged 3.5% in real terms but has been subject
to strong cyclical fluctuations. Manufacturing now represents the principal
sector in the generation of GDP, its share exceeding 35%.   Manufacturing
output has been increasing at an annual rate of about 5% since 1950, primarily
on account of the rapid expansion of the chemical, metal and engineering
industries.
2.02      The first comprehensive Industrial Promotion Law was enacted in
1958 providing incentives to local investors to exploit Argentina's natural
resources, decentralize and diversify industry, and expand exports. Subse-
quently, a number of revisions were carried out expanding and/or modifying
these incentives. In July 1977, the Government promulgated a new law which no
longer excludes foreign-owned enterprises from benefits and considerably
simplifies the administrative procedures.
2.03      During 1972-76, Government ownership of enterprises increased
considerably. Besides expanding its traditional participation in the oil, gas
and steel sectors, a petrochemical industry development program was elaborated
in 1973 which assigned an increased role to the public sector. Further, the
public sector took over a number of enterprises, both large and small, which
faced bankruptcy. While this Government intervention avoided large increases
in unemployment, fiscal burden of supporting these enterprises played an
important role in the monetary expansion and consequent inflation. The
Government which came to power in March 1976 moved to modify the previous
policies and to limit the state's direct participation in manufacturing
activities.
2.04      In the case of petroleum and petrochemicals, the Government has
announced its intention to revise its role in the sector.  Responsibility for
energy development, particularly the hydrocarbons, will remain largely with



the present public sector enterprises--crude petroleum and petroleum refining
with YPF and natural gas with Gas del Estado (GdE). However. the share of YPF
in oil exploration and production is expected to decline in the future as the
Government is encouraging private participation in those areas.   For core or
first generation upstream petrochemical refining projects, the Government
intends to develop projects with majority public sector ownership (through
Fabricaciones Militares) but with substantial private participation. Projects
using these core products, the so-called second generation plants, are to be
majority-owned by the private sector, but may have some participation from
government-owned enterprises. All further (third generation) transformation
plants will be completely owned by the private sector.
2.05      One of the major policy objectives of the present Government is to
reduce its fiscal deficit and to achieve greater efficiency of the public sector.
The Government is now also encouraging the private sector to mobilize private
savings for industrial investments so as to reduce the need for allocation of
industrial investment funds from the Government budget. In addition, it is
encouraging public sector enterprises to mobilize, through flexible compensation
policies, the technical expertise of the private sector to improve the
performance of public sector enterprises.
B.   Hydrocarbon Sector
1. Energy Base
2.06      Argentina has a substantial and diversified energy base.  Proven
reserves of crude oil are estimated at 2.4 billion barrels (bbl) or 330
million tons equivalent and those of natural gas are estimated at 21.2 trillion
cubic feet, i.e., 520 million tons of oil equivalent (TOE). The exploitable
hydroelectric power potential is estimated at 2.5 billion TOE, but the installed
capacity to date allows the harvesting of only about 7% of this potential.
Coal reserves are put at 450 million tons, of which 224 million tons are
classified as measured, 200 million tons as indicated and 26 million tons as
inferred; most consist of highly volatile bituminous steam coal of a relatively
low quality. Apart from hydroelectric power there is also potential for
renewable energy based on vegetable fuels (firewood, bagasse), geothermal,
nuclear, wind and solar energy. A large-scale expansion of hydroelectric
power generation is underway, and a gradual expansion of nuclear generation
based on domestic natural uranium is planned. As a primary development
objective in the energy sector, the Government aims at eliminating petroleum
imports by attaining self-sufficiency by the mid-1980s and building up
exports as more reserves are identified with increased encouragement to
private investment. Another important objective is to make increased use of
associated natural gas in the country to minimize the flaring of this premium
source of energy.
2.07      Petroleum and gas, while accounting for only 14% of identified
energy reserves, currently meet about 82% of domestic energy demand. Total
energy demand in 1980 is estimated at 42.8 million TOE, of which 56% is
accounted for by petroleum products, 26% by natural gas, 10% by hydro/nuclear
combined, 4% by coal and 4% by vegetable fuels. This high share of oil in the



total energy consumption in Argentina 1/ is expected to decline as the share
of natural gas, hydropower and other sources of energy increases in the
future.
2.08      Argentina has attained a high degree of self-sufficiency in hydro-
carbons. In 1979, imports accounted for only about 13% of domestic petroleum
needs and 20% of natural gas consumption. In that year, the country imported
12.6 million bbl of crude oil, 10.4 million bbl of petroleum products,
425,300 tons of liquid gas and 65 billion cu ft of gas at a total cost of
nearly US$1,055 million, 2/ equivalent to 18% of total merchandise imports.
As mentioned, Argentina plans to achieve self-sufficiency in crude oil by 1985
and possibly emerge as an exporter by 1990. In the case of natural gas also,
the country could emerge as a net exporter if the current plans to supply gas
to Brazil and Paraguay materialize. Meanwhile, Argentina is continuing
to honor the 20-year gas import contract with Bolivia, signed in 1972 before
the discovery of large domestic gas reserves.
2. Institutional Framework
2.09      Development of oil, gas and coal resources is the responsibility
of three State-owned entities: YPF, GdE 3/ and Yacimientos Carboniferos
Fiscales (YCF), respectively. All three organizations are under the Secretariat
of Fuels, of the Ministry of Works and Public Service. The Secretariat is
charged with responsibilities to: (i) regulate fuel prices; (ii) regulate the
planning and investment activities of YPF, GdE and YCF; (iii) approve oil
exploration and production contracts negotiated between YPF and private
companies; and (iv) develop new sources of energy and carry out overall energy
planning and conservation.   The Secretariat also has direct control over
three of the nine major State-owned power utilities.
3. Hydrocarbon Exploration and Production
2.10      Argentina's hydrocarbon bearing areas cover about 1.2 million
sq km onshore and 0.6 million sq km offshore. Of the 10 known basins, the
Cuyo basin is probably the best explored and the rest are yet to be adequately
explored. Cumulative discoveries of crude from the early 1900s have amounted
to about 5.6 billion bbl, of which 3.1 billion bbl have already been pro-
duced. Exploration activities have been surging since 1976 and the decline
in known reserves has been reversed largely because of the resumption of
exploration by private firms after the Government launched a policy of
encouraging such investments to complement YPF's efforts. Recent increases
in crude output have been brought about mainly by private firms.  These
firms now provide nearly one-third of the crude output, up from 27.5% in
1975. Associated with this development, there has been an increase in the
crude processed through secondary recovery. During 1976-79, the output of
11   For example, in the U.K. the share of oil in the total consumption of
energy is 38% compared to 56% in Argentina.
2/   Including US$353.5 million worth of crude oil, US$468.5 million worth
of petroleum products, US$119.6 million worth of liquid gas and US$112.9
million worth of natural gas.
3/   GdE is responsible for imports, processing and marketing of natural
gas and liquified petroleum gas (LPG).

crude oil increased by 18% from about 145 million bbl to 171 million bbl.
During the same period, YPF's share in total production declined from
74% to 67%.
4. Refining
2.11      There are 12 refineries in Argentina with a total capacity of
705,600 barrels per day (bpd) of which YPF accounts for 65% as shown in the

2.12      Most of the above twelve refineries are small and only four of them
have a capacity of more than 100,000 bpd (4.7 million tpy) each. La Plata
(YPF) is the biggest refinery with a capacity of 232,650 bpd (about 10.8
million tpy). The second biggest refinery is Lujan de Cuyo (YPF) with a
capacity of 128,800 bpd (6 million tpy). The La Plata and Lujan de Cuyo
refineries account for about 50% of total refining capacity in Argentina.
Although the major refineries of YPF are based on advanced refining processes
(such as catalytic cracking, hydrocracking, delayed coke, etc.), their relative
capacity to produce lighter and middle distillates is below those of the
private sector. In fact, whereas in 1979 YPF accounted for 73% of the total
crude processed in the country, it generated only 69% of the total middle and
light distillates and 79% of total fuel oil. As noted earlier, the Refinery
Conversion Scheme aims at converting the surplus fuel oil produced at the
two major YPF refineries into higher-value middle distillates.
2.13      In 1979, the average capacity utilization in all Argentine refineries
was about 76% compared to 85% in the YPF refineries (and 60% in the private
sector refineries). This is partly because the private refineries were not able
to get an adequate allocation of domestic crude as the country is not yet
self-sufficient in oil (para 3.05) and the Government has restricted import of
crude. In 1980, however, the Government modified its crude allocation policy to
give the private refineries a larger share of domestic crude and also allowed
them to import part of their crude requirements. As petroleum products demand
increases in Argentina and refinery configurations are converted to better
reflect the demand pattern for different products, the average capacity
utilization in the refinery sector is expected to increase to about 80% by 1985
and 90% by 1990 (para 4.08).
5. Natural Gas
2.14      Output of natural gas, which in Argentina is largely associated with
crude, increased at an annual rate averaging about 6% during the 1970s.
Natural gas output is concentrated in Santa Cruz and Neuquen, but the fastest
growth in recent years has taken place in the Tierra del Fuego fields (Map
IBRD-15312). During the last three years (1976-79), Argentina's gas reserves
nearly tripled to 21.2 trillion cu ft as a result of the Government's new
emphasis on exploration. Currently, gas production is running at about 1.2
billion cu ft/day, but about 30% of this production is being flared due to
lack of demand, and inadequate gas gathering and distribution systems.
However, use of gas is expected to grow rapidly between now and the turn of
the century to account for nearly a third of domestic energy consumption,
thus reducing the amount of gas flared. The country is expanding its gas
gathering and distribution system to meet this objective.  As an example, a
major effort to increase gas use is underway in Buenos Aires, the capital
city, where all heating systems are to be converted to natural gas by 1985.
More generally, because of the considerable scope for gas use in industry,
power generation and commercial sectors and the proposed changes in the relative
prices of fuel oil and gas as discussed below, gas demand is expected to grow at
about 10% a year through the mid-1980s. The above measures are geared to shift
fuel demand to natural gas.
2.15      The natural gas now being flared amounts to 350 million cu ft/day
and in terms of energy content is almost equivalent to Argentina's pretroleum
and natural gas imports combined. The principal reasons for the gas flaring



- 7 -
had been: (i) oil producers were reluctant to invest in gas gathering and
distribution systems because of the low delivery price paid by GdE, the agency in
charge of processing and marketing of natural gas as well as liquified petroleum
gas (LPG); and (ii) fuel oil was priced nationally about 10% below the consumer
price for gas to encourage the use of surplus fuel oil near refineries.
Corrective measures are being taken to increase gradually natural gas prices
to levels attractive to producers and raise fuel oil prices to a higher level
than natural gas prices. At the same time, under the Project surplus fuel oil
will be converted into middle distillates to allow natural gas to increase its
share of the energy market. In addition, as part of the Bank-financed Oil and
Gas Engineering Project (Report No. P-2745-AR, June 4, 1980), the Government
is carrying out a Gas Utilization Study. This Study will analyze the optimum
scope for natural gas output and use on a regional as well as national basis,
together with an assessment of alternative uses for fuels replaced by gas and
of related investment requirements.
6. Investment Program
2.16      The investment program in the oil and gas sector during 1980-85
aims at: (i) achieving self-sufficiency in crude oil; and (ii) expanding
and adapting the transport infrastructure for moving oil and gas from produc-
tion sites to the processing and consumption centers. The investment planning
is based on the assumption that total energy demand will increase by 5% a year,
while petroleum demand will grow at a lower rate (4% a year) as a result of
the intended large-scale substitution of natural gas (mainly for fuel oil),
expansion of hydroelectric power production and energy conservation efforts.
2.17      The Government is currently updating the investment program for the
oil and gas sector. Based on projects prepared by YPF and GdE, total investment
in the public sector during 1980-89 are expected to total about US$16 billion
(in 1979 prices); private sector investments, though more difficult to forecast
precisely, are likely to range from a minimum of US$5 billion (assuming
maintenance of the current share of the private sector in oil exploration and
development) to about US$10 billion (assuming a continuation of the Government
policy to encourage a greater participation of private firms in the sector).
Exploration and field development are expected to absorb nearly 80% of the
total investment. It is anticipated that these public and private sector
efforts will lead to the discovery and development of at least 2 billion bbl of
additional crude reserves which would help maintain the reserves/production
ratio at 15 years throughout the 1980s. Transport and distribution of gas would
require about 13% of the investment (US$1,960 million) and refining (mainly for
secondary processing) about 7% (US$1,000 million) of the public sector total.
7. Energy Conservation
2.18      Until recently, energy conservation measures in Argentina, as in
most other countries, were lacking. The most important energy conservation
tool, namely, pricing, was not used effectively due to the Government's
concern with inflation. However, the Government has now become increasingly
aware of the high use of energy particularly in the industrial sector, which
currently consumes nearly half of petroleum products. Therefore, it is now
developing a program for the conservation of energy resources by increasing the
price of energy (para 4.18) and by encouraging their more efficient use in existing
and new industrial enterprises. As an initial step, the Government plans to
carry out an energy audit of major energy-consuming industries, with a view to



identifying priority areas and measures for energy conservation. Under the
proposed project, the Bank would finance part of the cost of the audit which
would (i) review the present pattern of energy consumption in major energy-
intensive industries and the scope for substitution; (ii) identify the scope
for conservation in major industries and reduction of waste through retro-
fitting in industry; and (iii) review the potential for developing retro-
fitting equipment production in the country. The Government will consult with
the Bank on the selection and terms and conditions of the consultants to under-
take the study, and discuss the results of this study with the Bank and
subsequently prepare a program for implementing the recommendations of the
study by December 31, 1982 and then carry it out (para 5.11).
III. THE COMPANY
A.   Background
3.01      Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Sociedad del Estado (YPF), a
public sector company, operates in every branch of the petroleum and natural
gas sectors, except in the marketing of natural and liquified petroleum gas
(LPG) which is the responsibility of Gas del Estado (GdE). In 1979, YPF
accounted for 50% of exploration, 67% of crude oil production, 96% of natural
gas output and 73% of petroleum refining, with the private sector accounting
for the rest. With total assets of US$5.9 billion, an equity base of US$2.65
billion, gross sales of over US$4.5 billion and total personnel of 35,700 in
1979, YPF is the largest enterprise in Argentina and one of the largest oil
companies in Latin America.
3.02      YPF is charged with negotiating and monitoring exploration and pro-
duction contracts with private companies. Based on recent changes in Government
policy, exploration and production by private firms under contract with YPF have
been increasing. Private sector participation is on the basis of service-risk
contracts with YPF awarded through competitive bidding. Under these contracts,
ownership of crude oil remains with YPF, with the private companies receiving a
fee for their exploration and production activities. The service fee is estab-
lished as a percentage of the international price of crude, which is normally
set at the time of bidding for exploration contracts and which is adjusted
annually on the basis of a composite index of international prices,
variation in exchange rates and inflation rates. Reference crude prices
employed in recent awards have been about 55% of international prices with a
ceiling of 60%. As noted above, the Government until recently allocated crude
primarily to YPF's refineries. As a result of policy changes aimed at mini-
mizing processing and marketing costs of petroleum products, domestically-
produced crude from 1980 is allocated according to individual refineries' share
of the market for petroleum products.
3.03      A number of international companies participate along with YPF in
various petroleum commercial activities. Esso (Exxon) and Shell are active in
exploration, refining and marketing; Cities Service and Amoco, in production;
and TOTAL, Occidental, Union Oil of California and Union Oil of Texas, in ex-
ploration. About 30 domestic companies are producing hydrocarbons as contractors
of YPF and an additional 15 specialized firms provide services to Argentina's
petroleum industry. YPF owns and operates the country's entire network of crude
and petroleum product pipelines, while the natural gas pipelines are operated by
GdE. YPF also owns tankers to transport crude especially from southern
production centers not served so far by pipelines.

Total oil production has increased at an annual rate of 5.2% since 1976.
Based on YPF's policy to enlarge the role of the private sector in oil production,
YPF's own production has remained stable in recent years and major production
increases have been achieved by private firms under risk contracts. Production
of natural gas is entirely associated with the production of oil and has,
therefore, followed a similar rate of growth.

Of the total crude processed by YPF, local crude accounted for 88% in 1976,
rising to 92% in 1980. With the increase in crude oil production in Argentina,
the import dependence of YPF and other refineries has declined from about 22
million barrels in 1976 to 14.6 million barrels in 1980, accounting for less
than 8% of the total crude oil processed in the country. The country is
expected to be self-sufficient in crude oil by 1985.
3.06  ;   YPF owns and operates six of the 12 refineries in the country
(para 2.11), and has a total refining capacity of 460,000 bpd or about 65%
of Argentine refining capacity. Plantwise capacities and recent trends of
capacity utilization (1978-80) for YPF are shown below:

YPF-s refineries are operating well with the exception of the small refinery at
Campo Duran (32,000 bpd capacity), which is not able to reach high capacity
because the crude oil supply from nearby sources is being depleted and the
refinery's interior location makes it difficult to transport imported crude
for processing there. Excluding Campo Duran, the average capacity utilization
in YPF refineries was close to 91% in 1980. With the proposed Plant Opera-
tions Improvement Program (POIP) included in the Project (para 5.05), the
average capacity utilization is expected to go up to at least 95%. Besides,
this program will help to conserve energy through increased yields and control
pollution especially in La Plata and Lujan de Cuyo, the two largest refineries
which account for nearly 79% of YPF's total refinery capacity.
C.   Organization and Management
3.07      As mentioned, YPF is one of the three State-owned entities 1/ in the
energy sector under the Secretariat of Fuels, within the Ministry of Works and
Public Service.   YPF reports to the Secretariat through the Director-General
for Fuels (para 2.09), and was established in 1922 as a Government department
for developing the oil and gas resources of Argentina. In 1977, its status
was changed to a State company under the Law of State Corporations, thereby
increasing its operational autonomy. The Secretariat of Fuels is now involved
primarily in investment and pricing decisions. The main objective of the
change in the status of YPF is to encourage it to function more efficiently
along commercial lines without depending on government budget support.
3.08      According to the Law of State Corporations, YPF cannot be declared
bankrupt and can only be dissolved by law through the National Executive Power
Committee of the Government. At present, all the shares of YPF belong to the
Federal Government which has deposited them with the Sindicatura de Empresas
Publicas (the Syndicate of Public Enterprises), the Governnment's holding and
auditing company.
3.09      The direction and management of YPF is exercised by a Board of
Directors consisting of nine members including a President, a Vice-President
and seven Directors, all appointed for a term of three years and eligible for
reappointment without limitation. The Board meets twice a month to formulate
policies and overall development programs for the Company; it has an Executive
Committee which consists of the Vice-President and two Directors who are in
charge of three General Directorates namely Operations; Administration; and
Civil Works and Contracts, besides being members of the Board. The Company,
in accordance with Argentine Law, must have its accounts audited annually by
the Sindicatura General de Empresas Publicas.
1/   The other two organizations are Gas del Estado (GdE) and Yacimientos
Carboniferos Fiscales (YCF), the latter responsible for developing coal
resources.



- 12 -
3.10      Overstaffing was a problem in YPF prior to 1977.  Since then there
has been a considerable reduction in total employment. declining from 51,700 in
March 1976 to 34,806 in March 1980, a reduction of about 33%. However, during
the same period, the number of professionals has increased slightly from 2,430
to 2,440, raising their share from 4.7% to 7% of total employment. By adopting
increased flexibility in compensation policies, YPF has been able to attract
more competent personnel, some from the private sector.  Although general
salary increases in Argentina are overseen by the Ministry of Economy, YPF now
has sufficient freedom to determine adequate salaries and salary increases on
an individual basis.  With stabilization in the management situation, the
introduction of a flexible compensation policy, the reduction and restructuring
of personnel, and the generally more dynamic approach toward formulating and
implementing its increasingly complex tasks, YPF appears to have made consider-
able progress in improving its organization and operations since 1977.
3.11      YPF has already initiated two important measures to further improve
its organization and management. In January 1980, it appointed TOTAL, a
petroleum company of France, to review the operations of the La Plata refinery
and recommend measures for modernizing its operation and improving its efficiency.
Following submission of the TOTAL report in September 1980, YPF has developed
with the help of TOTAL a Plant Operations Improvement Program for the La Plata
as well as the Lujan de Cuyo refineries to supplement the proposed Refinery
Conversion Scheme to serve those refineries. Secondly, YPF appointed Arthur
Andersen & Co. in January 1980 to study the accounting and financial management
systems of the Company and develop a program to streamline, upgrade and expand
those systems. Arthur Andersen have completed their study and preparation of
the Financial Management Improvement Program. YPF is, therefore, considered
ready to derive maximum benefits from the comprehensive financial and operational
improvement programs which the Company will implement with Bank assistance as
part of the Project (para 5.02).
D.   Accounting and Financial Management
3.12      Since 1977, YPF's accounting system and procedures have been revised
completely from the previous Government budgetary system to a financial
accounting more suited for the changed status of YPF from a Government depart-
ment to semi-autonomous industrial enterprise. YPF is now improving the
reliability and timely availability of accounting data as well as establishing
an integrated information system for accounting, costing, cash management
and budgeting. With substantial additional recruitment of experienced staff
for the finance and controller's departments, supplemented with technical
assistance from Arthur Andersen, YPF is introducing a comprehensive cost
accounting system throughout its operating departments. At the same time,
YPF is integrating its management information system to serve not only its
accounting needs but also its cash management, budget forecast and control,
monthly reports, and cost accounting and control. The work of Arthur Andersen
is currently concentrated in the important areas of development and imple-
mentation of cost accounting and management information systems. YPF will
subsequently use their services for introducing long-term capital budgeting
and financial planning. Arthur Andersen will also organize training for YPF
personnel to improve the overall financial management of the Company (para 5.22).



- 13 -
Thus, substantial improvements in the Company's accounting and financial
management have taken place recently and further steps are underway. However,
continual substantial efforts will be needed to complete the transformation of
YPF's management information system into an effective management tool to serve
its diverse and complex operations. With continuity in management and the
assistance of outside consultants, it is expected that YPF will establish an
adequate information system within a reasonable period.

3.14      Analysis of YPF's financial statements is complex because (a) the
accounting system has gradually been changing since 1977 from a budgetary
system to a financial accounting system, and (b) YPF's accounting periods have
been somewhat irregular in the recent past (closing dates were July 31, 1977.
June 30, 1978 and December 31, 1978). The comparability of audited statements
for periods prior to June 30, 1978 is, therefore, limited. Operating profits,
as an indicator of the Company's profitability, improved significantly in the
second half of 1978 primarily due to a reduction in payroll expenses following
the retrenchment of surplus staff, combined with the introduction of more
efficient management and procurement practices.  However, during 1979,                      t
operating profits as a percentage of net sales declined, as selling prices
deteriorated sharply in real terms. To improve the financial position of YPF,
in connection with the Oil and Gas Engineering Project, the Government decided
as a first step to increase--starting from January 1980--retail prices of
petroleum products and gas by 1.5 to 2% a month in real terms above the non-
agricultural wholesale price index. These increases helped improve the Company's
operating profit margin from 6.3% in 1979 to 11.6% in 1980. The price increases
continued until the end of March 1981 and resulted in price increases of 25%
in real terms for YPF products during 1980/81.
3.15      YPF's profitability as reflected by net profit is significantly
better than that shown by operating profit because of the Company's substantial
revaluation gains. YPF's current ratio was 1:1 in 1978, improved to about 1.3:1
in 1979 but declined slightly to 1.1:1 in 1980. The quick ratio also improved
from 0.7:1 in 1978 to 0.8:1 in 1979 but declined slightly to 0.7:1 in 1980.
The low liquidity ratios of YPF are mainly due to high short-term borrowings,
largely to make up for the non-availability of sufficient long-term financing
from local sources in the light of high inflation. Local financial institutions
lend mostly for short periods with interest rates to be established every month,
and those short-term loans are normally rolled over. Besides, current liabilities
include sales and other taxes (which amount to about 43% of the retail price of
some petroleum products) collected by YPF, which are to be paid to the Government
within 37 days. 1/ Thus, YPF can use that amount for about five weeks as
working capital, while it sells petroleum products to private retailers on a
cash basis. YPF prudently tries to minimize local borrowings, by keeping its
inventory levels low and selling mostly for cash. It-borrows in foreign markets
(enjoying as it does,a high credit rating) to finance foreign as well as local
costs. Because of the above factors, YPF's liquidity position though tight is
considered manageable.
3.16      The Company currently has a very sound -capital structure as a result
of large gains from revaluation of assets.  Such accounting practice is
considered essential under the high inflation rates experienced in Argentina
in recent years. Total equity of YPF at the end of 1980 was at the satisfactory
level of about 50% of total assets.
1/ The time allowed in the past-was 52 days.  It was reduced to 37 days in 1979.
For any delay in payment beyond the specified period, YPF has to pay a
monthly interest of 5%.

The above figures show that only about 11% of YPF-s 1980 investment require-
ments was financed from self-generated funds from operations. The rest
of the financing was derived mainly through working capital reduction. This
highlights the fact that despite YPF's satisfactory capitalization ratios,
its cash flow and operating profits (based on the current revenue/cost struc-
ture) are not adequate at present to finance a reasonable part of the projected
large investment program of YPF--US$12.5 billion during 1980-89. The real
increases of crude and petroleum product prices in 1980/81 are not yet adequate
to enable the Company to earn a reasonable return on its assets which could
then be channeled for reinvestment. Agreement has been reached with the
Government that it will take measures to ensure that the ex-refinery prices of
YPF's products are adequate to provide YPF, operating efficiently, with funds
sufficient to cover all costs and expenses before interest, to earn a reasonable
return on its revalued net fixed assets in service, and to meet sound financial
ratios (paras 7.11 and 7.12). Also, an understanding has been reached with the
Government that the domestic retail prices of petroleum products will be
maintained in real terms at the May 1, 1981 level using the non-agricultural
wholesale price index for periodic adjustment of the retail prices.
3.18      Currently, YPF does not prepare financial projections for all its
operations including oil exploration and production, refining, marketing, etc.
A capital budgeting and financial planning system will be established under the
Financial Management Improvement Program, a part of the Project. Agreement has
been reached with YPF that it will submit every year within four months of the

closing of the previous fiscal year 12-month projections of income statements,
sources and applications of funds and balance sheets for the Company as a whole,
the first such projection being due by end-April 1983 (para 7.12).
IV. REFINERY PRODUCTS IARKET AND ILARKETING
4.01      As mentioned, the Project is designed to convert a significant part of
Argentina's existing and projected fuel oil surplus into lighter and middle pe-
troleum distillates in deficit in the country. The Project would, thus, correct
the existing unbalance between the demand and supply of petroleum products in
Argentina, and the marketing of the project output is not expected to be a problem.
Still, to put the Project in proper perspective, this Chapter discusses in detail
the various aspects of petroleum products market and marketing.
A.   Historical Consumption and Production
4.02       Although consumption of refinery products in Argentina over the last
19 years (1960-79) has increased by an average of about 3.9% annually, the
growth rate has fluctuated substantially from year to year, in line with the
economic growth and changes in relative prices of refinery products. The
historic consumption and production of refinery products is shown below:

4.03      As a result of a continued high rate of growth of the Argentine
economy in the early 1970s, total consumption of refinery products increased
at an annuai rate of 5.2% during the 1970-73 period. However, during the next
three years (1974-76), consumption fell continuously because of the country's
economic slump and the world oil and economic crisis. Consumption started its
upturn in 1977 with the introduction of the economic stabilization program.

products, for 1960 and 1979 are shown below:

During 1960-79, consumption of various refinery products grew at different
rates, changing significantly the relative consumption pattern of main products.
While gasoline, gas oil and diesel oil increased their share in total consump-
tion, the shares of kerosene and fuel oil declined, as less kerosene was being
used with the improvement in the standard of living, and as residual fuel oil
was gradually being replaced by natural gas.
4.04      During the same period (1960-79), production of refinery products
increased at an average annual rate of only 3.9% or about the same rate
as consumption. Similarly, the share of gasoline and gas oil and diesel oil in
total refinery products went up while that of fuel oil and kerosene and jet
fuel declined. A product-by-product comparison of production and consumption
shows that the deficit occurs mostly in gas oil, diesel oil and in gasoline.
4.05      In 1979, the surplus of fuel oil in Argentina was about 4.9 million
barrels. The surplus is expected to increase sharply in the future following
the planned switch-over from the use of fuel oil to that of natural gas in
industrial enterprises and utility companies to economically utilize the large
quantities of associated gas currently being flared and that likely to be
discovered through ongoing exploration. As noted previously, the Refinery
Conversion Scheme of YPF is designed to convert a major part of this surplus
fuel oil into lighter products (such as gasoline, gas oil, diesel oil, etc.)
to bring about a better balance in the supply and demand of refinery products.

B.   Demand Forecast Through 1990
4.06      Until recently, the Government had kept the domestic petroleum
product and gas prices low compared to international prices. Starting in
early 1980, however, the Government has been gradually increasing these
prices. Furthermore, to encourage substitution of natural gas for petroleum
products (especially for home heating, power generation, steam generation
in industries and chemicals production), the Government intends to keep
the gas prices slightly below (on an energy equivalent basis) the price
of residual fuel oil; this should reduce the demand for residual fuel oil.
As for kerosene, which is used primarily for household cooking, the demand is
expected to decline gradually as per capita income increases and as people
switch over to the use of gas for cooking.  Further, the demand for diesel oil
used in power stations is expected to decline sharply from 1982 onwards as
additional gas gathering and distribution systems are completed and the
power stations substitute gas for diesel oil. However, gas oil and diesel
oil consumption by other consumers (such as railways and in truck transporta-
tion) is expected to increase significantly while their consumption (bunker
gas oil and diesel oil) in shipping is forecast to show only a marginal
increase. Apart from gas oil and diesel oil (for uses other than in power
generation and shipping), the refinery products for which demand is expected
to grow fast are naphtha (for the petrochemical industry), gasoline (for
motor vehicles and aviation) and jet fuel (for aviation).
4.07      Taking the above factors and the historical trend of consumption into
consideration, the Bank staff estimates 1/ of refinery products' demand for the
period 1980-1990 are shown below:

1/  Demand estimates prepared by YPF for fuel oil, gasoline, and gas oil
and diesel oil were on average about 20-25% higher than Bank estimates
for 1990, partly because of lower increase in prices assumed by YPF
for those products.

Gasoline demand is expected to increase by 4.0% p.a. between 1980 and 1990,
slightly below the annual rate of 4.8% achieved in 1970-79. The rate of
growth in demand for diesel and gas oil at 3.5% p.a. is expected to be
significantly lower than the rates achieved in the past, as consumption
of diesel oil in power plants declines with the switch over from diesel oil
to natural gas. During 1980-90, demand for kerosene is expected to decline
annually at about 2.4% and for fuel oil at 4.2% in response to the increased
availability of gas following investments in gas gathering and distribution
systems and in response to the pricing and other measures aimed at promoting
the substitution of kerosene and fuel oil with gas. In the light of the large-
scale expansion of the petrochemical sector envisaged for 1980-85, naphtha
demand is projected to grow at 12.1% per year; thereafter, plans for further
growth of the petrochemical sector are not clear at present. Therefore, it is
assumed that there would be only a marginal increase in naphtha consumption
(0.3% per year) during 1985-90. Considering the expansion of aviation in
Argentina, demand for jet fuel is expected to increase by 7.3% p.a. during the
1980's.
C.   Supply of Selected Refinery Products Through 1990
4.08      A review of the future production programs of all domestic refineries
in operation along with that of the YPF Refinery Conversion Scheme, which is
the only project in the refinery sector approved by the Ministry of Economy
intending to add capacity, 1/ indicates the following domestic production
forecast of selected refinery products:
1/   A new refinery project is in the intial stages of consideration by
the private sector.  This is not included in the projections.

Note:  The increase in fuel oil production by Esso and Shell is entirely due to
the:expected increase in capacity utilization.
The production forecasts are based on the assumption,that the capacity util-
ization in the refinery sector as a whole will increase from 76% in 1979
to 80% in 1985 and 90% in 1990 (para 2.13).

4.10       Even after the commissioning of the Refinery Conversion Scheme in
1985, there would still be a deficit in some refinery products (e.g., gasoline,
gas oil and diesel oil, naphtha and jet fuel). and surplus of fuel oil and
also kerosene.  Kerosene surplus is expected to reach around 6.3 million
barrels in 1985, rising to 7.1 million by 1990 because of the expected
decline in consumption due to the substitution of natural gas for kerosene
for household use. The fuel oil surplus in 1985 would be about I million
barrels, rising to 2.8 million barrels in 1990; without the Conversion
Scheme, the fuel oil surplus in Argentina in 1985 would be 16.2 million
barrels, increasing to 28.2 million barrels in 1990. Considering the
relatively small quantities involved, no major problem is foreseen in
marketing surplus fuel oil and kerosene in neighboring countries such as
Colombia, Bolivia, Chile and Paraguay, which are projected to continue to
import large quantities of these products. In case no further refinery
capacity is installed, the deficit for gasoline, gas oil and diesel oil,



- 22 -
naphtha and jet fuel would worsen beyond 1985. Agreement has been reached
with YPF and the Government that they would periodically exchange views with
the Bank on the plans for expanding the refinery capacity in Argentina.
E.   Distribution and Transportation
4.11      Buenos Aires and the San Lorenzo region in the eastern part of
Argentina account for about 50% of the total consumption of petroleum products,
Mendoza and the surrounding areas in the western part account for an additional
25%, and the other parts of the country account for the remaining 25%. The
main marketing area of the (YPF) La Plata Refinery is the Buenos Aires region,
while the main marketing zone of the (YPF) Lujan de Cuyo Refinery is the
Mendoza region where demand for petroleum products is also growing fast (Map
IBRD-15312).
4.12      Argentina s system of pipelines is owned and operated by YPF to
transport crude and petroleum products between strategic locations. About 45%
of crude and one-third of petroleum products are moved by pipelines, the
remainder being transported by coastal tankers, rail and road. Crude oil pipe-
lines total some 1,700 km in length, have 0.43 million tpd (3.2 million bbl/day)
capacity, and are concentrated in Neuquen and the northern region (Map IBRD-15312).
Crude from the southern production centers is transported by tankers entirely
owned and operated by YPF. Product pipelines are 2,950 km in length and have a
capacity for nearly 0.4 million tpd (3 million bbl/day). Storage capacity for
crude oil and petroleum products is about 18 million bbl each or about 40-day
supply which is adequate in light of Argentina s relatively high degree of
self-sufficiency.
4.13      The Lujan de Cuyo Refinery is about 1,000 km away from the San
Lorenzo and Buenos Aires regions, the major consuming centers of refinery
products. There is a network of product pipelines from Lujan de Cuyo to San
Lorenzo and La Matanza (near Buenos Aires). However, as the supply of refinery
products from Lujan de Cuyo increases substantially following the Conversion
Scheme, along certain sections of the pipeline where there is no surplus
capacity available for product movement, either additional pumping stations
will have to be established or the existing pumping stations expanded.
Although these facilities will not involve significant investments, they are
nevertheless essential for the movement of products. Agreement has been reached
with YPF and the Government that they will expand the transport capacity of the
petroleum product pipeline from Lujan de Cuyo to La Matanza and construct/pro-
vide the facilities for the transport of crude oil from Neuquen to Lujan-de
Cuyo in time for the Conversion scheme.
F.   Marketing Organization and Policies of YPF
4.14      The marketing organization of YPF for refinery products is divided
into two units, each under a Marketing Manager.  One unit deals with the
distribution to industrial consumers, shipping companies, commercial aviation
and the armed forces, and the other deals with distribution to the general
public. There are nine sales regions, each under the responsibility of a
regional sales manager. Currently YPF sells about US$12 million worth of
refinery products every day of which about US$8 million (two-thirds) is accounted
for by sales to the general public. There are about 1,900 persons engaged in
the marketing operation, including 1,600 for distribution to the general public.



- 23 -
4.15      There are about 6,000 petrol stations in the country of which
2,800 are outlets for YPF products, including 33 operated by YPF itself and
the rest run by private dealers. YPF estimates that the net additions to the
number of stations served by YPF will be about 20 per year during the next
decade. From its experience in running its own petrol stations, YPF has
estimated that a station has to sell at least 130,000 liters/day to break
even. The average sale per station serving as YPF outlet is 170,000 liters/day.
Average freight distance from the pipeline and storage depots to the petrol
stations served by YPF is 250 km.
4.16      The marketing margin is fixed by the Government.  It currently
averages about 11.63% of the retail price, including 6.31% for the dealers and
the rest for the Company. The marketing margin is reasonable and is adjusted
periodically along with the adjustment of retail prices. Further, YPF is
encouraging dealers in rural and semi-urban areas to sell soft-drinks, bottled
LPG and briquets (for home heating) so that they can earn additional income
and remain in petroleum distribution business even though their sales of
petroleum products have not yet reached the economic level.
4.17      YPF has recently strengthened its marketing team and has prepared a
preliminary marketing plan for the medium term (1980-85) which includes:
(i) rationalization of the service station network by increasing the number in
areas with good potential for sales and closing uneconomic stations in areas where
sales are low; (ii) continuing the program for improving the operations of the
storage and delivery stations to reduce loading time and freight charges; (iii)
achieving better inventory control by installing volumetric meters in the storage and
delivery stations; (iv) utilization of more transportation companies for contract
distribution in order to reduce the risk from strikes; (v) increasing the share of
profitable products (e.g., jet fuel) in total product mix and discontinuing or
reducing the share of nonprofitable products (e.g., asphalt); (vi) implementing
modifications in existing facilities to increase the quantity of jet fuel to
meet the growing demand; (vii) studying and developing improved methods for
the transportation and distribution of asphalt taking advantage of the existing
infrastructure; (viii) promoting a reduction in the number of products to
reduce the costs of stocks and storage and restructuring the sales network
and discontinuing storage facilities which are not necessary in the light of
reduced number of products distributed; and (ix) developing new visual identi-
fication systems for YPF for service stations, delivery plants, delivery tank
wagons, storage tanks, publicity materials, etc. Agreement has been reached
that YPF will finalize the marketing plan by March 31, 1982, and carry out the
plan by June 30, 1985.
G.   Petroleum Products Pricing
4.18      Between early 1976 and mid-1978, the Government enacted price
increases for petroleum products at all levels. Measured in current US dollar
terms, increases over this period were about 40% for crude prices, 114% for
retail prices of petroleum products and 85-90% for natural gas. However, in an
attempt to slow down inflation (which was running at the rate of 175% in 1978
and 160% in 1979), the Government, during 1978 and 1979, kept these increases
significantly below increases in the overall price level and in fuel import
costs. As a result, at the end of 1979, prices of petroleum products in
Argentina were below international levels.



- 24 -
4.19      However, in connection with the appraisal of the Oil and Gas Engineering
Project (Report No. P-2745-AR, June 4, 1980), the Government conveyed to the
Bank its intention to increase petroleum prices during 1980 by 1.8% per month
in real terms over and above the increase in non-agricultural wholesale prices
starting from January 1980. This approach was actually followed until the end
of March 1981 when the new Government came to power. An understanding has been
reached with the new Government that domestic retail prices of petroleum products
will be maintained in real terms at the May 1, 1981 level. The retail prices
in Argentina in May 1981 were substantially higher than in the US and were at
levels comparable to those in India as shown below:

Price Resolution, May 1, 1981 for Argentina.
4.20      Current petroleum product prices at the consumer level compare favorably
with other countries. There is a need, however, to further rationalize the structure
of petroleum product prices to induce optimum consumption patterns consistent with
the resources available and energy conservation goals. For example, while
retail gasoline prices are relatively high, the crude prices are extremely low
(US$11.8/bbl) compared to the FOB international price of US$35/barrel. Also,
the retail prices of diesel and fuel oil 1/ are low relative both to their
current economic value and to other hydrocarbon product prices. The spread in
prices between crude and final products do not accrue to the refineries, but are
taxed heavily by the Government (taxes range from 6% of retail price for fuel
oil to 58% for premium gasoline) and these taxes are used to finance federal and
local transport related programs and to compensate crude importers for the
difference between international and domestic crude prices.
4.21      The new Government which came into power in Aarch 1981 plans to continue
the policy of revising the price of petroleum products periodically to reflect
adequately the changes in internal price levels and international petroleum prices.
1/ The domestic fuel oil price in May 1981 was US$126/ton compared to the
FOB international price of US$195/ton.



- 25 -
In order to ensure a rationalization of petroleum prices, an understal. ing has
been reached with the Government that domestic crude oil price paid to YPF will
be raised to levels comparable to those of private petroleum companies under
risk-sharing contracts negotiated by the Government in 1980, and that domestic
price of petroleum products will be maintained, in real terms at least at the
May 1, 1981 level. Agreement has also been reached with the Government
that ex-refinery product prices will be set at a level that would provide YPF,
operating efficiently, with funds sufficient to cover all its costs and
expenses before interest, to earn a reasonable return on its revalued net fixed
assets in service, and to meet sound financial ratios (paras 7.11 and 7.12).
Furthermore, the Government has agreed that the level and inter-product price
structure at the consumer level between natural gas and petroleum products
will be rationalized following the completion of the Gas Utilization Study
(financed under the Oil and Gas Engineering Loan).
V. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Objectives and Scope
5.01      The primary objectives of the Project are to convert Argentina's
substantial surplus low-value residual fuel oil to higher-value refinery
products in short supply, improve the performance of YPF's major refineries,
strengthen the company's financial management system, training of YPF opera-
tional staff, and study the potential for energy saving in the industrial
sector.
5.02      The proposed Project includes five components:  (i) the Refinery
Conversion Scheme to convert annually a total of about 4.2 million tons (28
million barrels) of fuel oil from the La Plata and Lujan de Cuyo refineries to
about 3.9 million tons (26 million barrels) of higher-value lighter distillates
and coke; (ii) a Plant Operations Improvement Program (POIP), with particular
emphasis on energy saving and pollution control aspects at the La Plata and
Lujan de Cuyo refineries based upon the recommendations made by TOTAL, the
French petroleum company; (iii) a Financial Management Improvement Program
(FMIP) for YPF, with particular attention to establishment of cost centers,
and introduction of systems for cost-control, management information, capital
budgeting and financial planning based upon a study carried out by Arthur
Andersen & Co.; (iv) a Training Program for YPF, with particular emphasis on
the needs of its refinery division; and (v) an Industrial Energy Audit of the
major industrial enterprises of Argentina, to determine the scope for energy
saving in those units along with the related investment requirements. The
component (v) will be carried out with the assistance of consultants under the
auspices of the Secretariat of Fuels of the Ministry of Works and Public
Service, while the rest of the components will be carried out by YPF with the
help of capable and experienced engineering firms for project design, engine-
ering, procurement, and implementation.

B.   Project Description
1.   Refinery Conversion Scheme
5.03      The La Plata Refinery and the Lujan de Cuyo Refinery together
account for 79% of YPF's total refinery capacity in its six refineries, and
51% of the total Argentine refining capacity. Individually, the La Plata
and Lujan de Cuyo refineries are capable of processing 220,150 bpd and
128,950 bpd of crude oil, respectively. Although both the refineries have
secondary processing facilities in the form of coking and fluid catalytic-
cracking, the respective capacities are relatively small and a large proportion
of reduced crude 1/ is directly blended into the fuel oil pool. The Refinery
Conversion Scheme is designed to process almost all of the reduced crude at
each location into feedstocks for subsequent conversion into light or middle
distillates as well as coke in the proposed coking and fluid catalytic
cracking (FCC) plants. Coking plants have relatively low investment costs
per unit of distillates produced compared to other conversion schemes such
as hydro-cracking. Coking plants, however, can only be used if low-sulfur
crudes are available, which is the case in Argentina where a large portion
of the domestic crude oil has a low-sulfur content.
5.04      Through linear programming, YPF's Technical Department studied
a number of configurations for the Refinery Conversion Scheme to optimize the
output of both the La Plata and Lujan de Cuyo refineries. These alternatives
included several combinations of conversion processes such as catalytic
cracking and delayed coking and diasphalting as well as expansion of the
existing vacuum distillation capacity. They were then ranked according to
their revenue/investment ratios. Subsequently, three alternatives with the
highest ratios were investigated in detail from a technical as well as economic
point of view to select the basis for a feasibility study. The final project
configuration was agreed during appraisal by modifying the one used in the
feasibility study. The capacity of the hydrotreater in Lujan de Cuyo was
reduced to reflect a higher proportion of low-sulfur crudes in the total
feed than originally envisaged. Similarly, the capacity of the vacuum unit
in La Plata was marginally reduced due to less than originally anticipated
residue from the low-sulfur crude available to La Plata. A fluid catalytic
cracker was also added at La Plata in the light of revised projections of
fuel oil demand showing a further erosion due to an aggressive program for
11 Reduced crude is the crude fraction obtained after initial distillation
of crude petroleum and which can be subjected to vacuum flashing and
vacuum distillation.

switching over from the use of fuel oil to natural gas in industrial and
power plants and consequent need for additional conversion capacity. The
final project configuration thus derived is given below:
Scope of Refinery Conversion Scheme
Capacity (m 3/day)
At La Plata Refinery
Vacuum Fractionation                                    5,000
Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC)                          4,500
Delayed Coking                                          3,000
Hydrotreating of Light Gas Oil (LGO)                    1,100
LPG Merox Treatment                                     2,383
Gas Separation Unit                              Of suitable capacity to
handle gases from FCC
and delayed coker units
At Lujan de Cuyo Refinery
Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC)                          3,300
Delayed Coking                                          3,200
Hydrotreating of LGO                                    1,900
LPG Merox Treatment                                     1,410
Gas Separation Unit                              Of suitable capacity to
handle gases from FCC
and delayed coker units
Concurrently with the implementation of the conversion subproject at La Plata,
the Company plans to carry out the following: (i) replacement of two of the
old existing coking chambers with a capacity to produce about 123,000 tons per
year of acicular coke; (ii) replacement and/or additions of pumps, drives,
pipes, fractionators to ensure a sustained sponge coker charge stock capacity
of 1,500 m3/day; and (iii) modification of the furnaces in the Topping Units 4
and 5 and improvement in the vacuum system so that the Conversion Scheme,
supplemented by the proposed debottlenecking, would enable both refineries to
operate close to their design capacity on a sustained basis.
2.   Plant Operations Improvement Program
5.05      Based upon the study carried out by TOTAL for La Plata and by a
study made by the specialists of Lujan de Cuyo, YPF has prepared a program
for plant operations improvements in the La Plata and Lujan de Cuyo refineries.
The improvement program will include: (i) energy conservation measures;
(ii) pollution control measures; (iii) better maintenance to avoid unnecessary
shutdowns; (iv) modernization of instrumentation; (v) improvements in production
processes; (vi) better transportation management in relation to the selection
and leasing of vehicles for product distribution, contract maintenance, etc.;
(vii) introduction of a standard costing system; (viii) establishment of a
management planning unit in each refinery; (ix) organizational changes on the
lines of refineries in developed countries to increase efficiency of operation;
(x) improvement in wage policy to minimize turnover of professionals; and (ix)
optimization of process units through a dynamic mathematic model.



- 28 -
5.06      The implementation of the POIP is being initiated with technical
assistance from TOTAL. The total cost of the POIP is estimated at US$113
million. Two important components of the POIP--energy conservation and
pollution control subprojects--will be financed out of the proceeds of the
proposed loan and the rest will be financed by YPF with its own internally
generated funds. The energy conservation and pollution subprojects of POIP
are estimated to cost about US$50 million including US$26 million in foreign
exchange.
5.07      The Energy Conservation Subproject will include:  (i) improvement in
the accuracy of instrumentation to locate and minimize leaks; (ii) maximiza-
tion of the use of flared gas: (iii) maximization of the recovery of LPG--butane
and propane; (iv) optimization of the steam balance, loss prevention and
condensate recovery; (v) introduction of air preheat and forced drought where
necessary to save energy (which would save up to 7% of energy in each refinery);
(vi) better combustion control of furnaces and boilers (which would save up to
2% of energy in each refinery); (vii) chemical cleaning of boilers (which
would save about 1% of energy in each refinery); and (viii) switch-over from
the use of fuel oil to refinery gas wherever possible.
5.08      The Pollution Control Subproject will concentrate on the La Plata
Refinery, with particular attention to overcoming the water pollution problem
there. (At Lujan de Cuyo, acceptable standards of pollution control have
already been adopted.) Measures to be taken to solve the water pollution
problem include: (i) direction of all clean water that can be separated from
the oily water into side channels: (ii) reduction in the leakage and losses
from the cooling water system: (iii) maximization of the use of tank traps
for rainwater collection; (iv) improvement in the operation of API separators;
and (v) reducing leakages and losses of water before it enters the API separator.
As for overcoming the air pollution problem, modification of the existing
fixed roof type for storage tanks is needed to prevent substantial losses of
hydrocarbons due to thermal variations: and (vi) installation of necessary
pollution control equipment.
3.   Financial Management Improvement Program
5.09      The program is based on the recommendations of a detailed study of
YPF's financial and accounting system completed by Arthur Andersen & Co. in
September 1980. As noted, the program will initially concentrate on the
establishment of cost centers and the introduction of the management information
system (para 3.12).  Subsequently, the program will emphasize the introduction
of medium-term capital budgeting and financial planning.
4.   Training Program
5.10      The training program will concentrate on training YPF personnel in
modern financial management systems, energy saving and pollution control tech-
niques, better operating and maintenance practices. This program excludes the
training of selected personnel in operation and maintenance of the Refinery
Conversion Scheme which will be carried out as part of the Scheme in vendor
workshops and plants selected by the engineering contractor.



- 29 -
5.   Industrial Energy Audit
5.11      The Industrial Energy Audit will examine and recommend the nec-
essary measures to improve efficiency in the use of energy in major indus-
trial undertakings, excluding YPF refineries which have already been studied.
Agreement has been reached with the Government that the Bank will be given
an opportunity to comment on the recommendations of the Audit and that the
recommendations will be implemented expeditiously.
C.   Raw Materials and Infrastructure
5.12      Main raw materials for the Refinery Conversion Scheme will be:
(i) residual fuel oil--about 2.5 million tpy for La Plata and 1.7 million tpy
for Lujan de Cuyo--for conversion to higher value distillates, and
(ii) refinery gas to replace fuel oil in utilities. The residual fuel oil
will be supplied by the existing refineries in those locations. The crude oil
supply to the La Plata Refinery is assured from the oilfields at Cuenca
Neuquen, Santa Cruz, Chabut and Tierra del Fuego through pipelines and/or
shipping. Currently, the La Plata Refinery meets about 90% of its crude oil
requirement from local sources and the rest from imports. The import dependence
of La Plata is expected to decrease in the future with increased local crude
production from the oilfields mentioned above.
5.13      The Lujan de Cuyo Refinery, which relies at present entirely on
the oilfields at Mendoza for crude, requires about 20,500 m3/day (128,945 bpd)
of crude at full production but is presently getting only 18,500 m3/day
(116,365 bpd), 15% less than its requirements, because the oil production
in the Mendoza region is going down with the depletion of the known reserves
there. The shortfall is expected to increase from the current daily level of
3,000 m3 to 6,200 m3 by 1985 and 13,430 m3 by 1990, unless measures are taken
to increase the oil supply to the refinery from more distant oilfields. This
requires the building of a 560-km pipeline to connect the refinery to the
Neuquen region where substantial proven reserves of low sulfur, high quality
crude oil exist. YPF has prepared plans for building this pipeline which is
estimated to cost about US$120 million. YPF has carried out a feasibility
study for this pipeline and has shown that the construction of this pipeline
is the optimal alternative for the supply of oil to the Lujan de Cuyo Refinery
as well as for the use of the Neuquen oil. The construction of the pipeline
is expected to take two years compared to four years for the Conversion
Scheme. Agreement has been reached with the Government and YPF that the
facilities for the transport of crude oil from Neuquen to Lujan de Cuyo will
be constructed in time for the proposed conversion facility at Lujan de
Cuyo.

5.14      The available primary and secondary reserves of crude oil in the
oilfields serving and/or expected to serve the refineries at La Plata and
Lujan de Cuyo are given below:

1,531              919             2,450
5.15      The available oil reserves as of December 31, 1979 in Argentina
were 2.45 billion barrels which are adequate to meet the needs of the existing
refineries at 90% production fot about 12 years. Prospects for further
exploration and increased domestic production are considered bright given the
large hydrocarbon-bearing areas (estimated at 1.2 million sq km onshore and
0.4 million sq km offshore) and limited exploration in nine of the ten basins
(para 2.10). Agreement has been reached with the Government and YPF that
adequate arrangements will be made to meet the crude oil requirements of La
Plata and Lujan de Cuyo refineries.
D.   Utilities
1.   Lujan de Cuyo Refinery
5.16      Water Supply:  The refinery currently receives water from Mendoza
river about 2 km away through the Lujan de Cuyo thermal electricity plant.
Raw water is passed through a system of decanters and filters. Filtered water
is in part demineralized in conventional zeolite system to produce boiler feed
water; the rest is used for circulating cooling water makeup, potable water
supply (after chlorination) and for firefighting water storage. The main
supply system is designed for 860 liters per second and the refinery presently
consumes at the rate of only 465 liters per second. The boilerfeed water
treatment plant has a total capacity of 660 tons per hour (tph) against the
present requirement of maximum 410 tph. Main water supply and boiler-feed
water systems have adequate overcapacity to cover the additional requirements
of the Conversion Scheme. No major additions to the recirculating cooling
water system is envisaged.



- 31 -
5.17     Steam:  Currently, the installed steam generation capacity totals
410 tph. To provide for the incremental steam requirement for the Conversion
Scheme of 80 tph and to provide spare capacity, total new generation capacity
of 150 tph is planned.
5.18    Electric Power:  The refinery receives power supply from the adjacent
thermal power station at 13.2 KV and is stepped down to 2.3 KV for supply to
high voltage motors and to 415 V and 210 V for other plant prime movers and
lighting. These arrangements are adequate.
5.19      In addition to 12 MVA purchased from the thermal power plant, the
refinery generates 4 MVA. Incremental requirements of 4 MVA for the Conver-
sion Scheme will be met by additional purchases from the thermal power plant
where present generation capacity of 120 MVA is planned to be raised to 360
MVA by 1982. Power supply is dependable with very few breakdowns or voltage
and frequency fluctuations.
2.   La Plata Refinery
5.20      Water Supply:  The present facilities include decantation and
filtration facilities for 3,610 tph river water, treatment of 660 tph filtered
water for boiler water feed and treatment of 100 tph water for potable uses.
The facilities will be expanded to initial filtration capacity of 4,260 tph
and 860 tph for boiler feedwater treatment.
5.21     Steam and Power Supply:  No major additions to steam generation and
power generation facilities for the Conversion Scheme are envisaged.
E.   Project Management and Implementation
5.22      As mentioned, YPF will be responsible for the implementation of all
the components of the Project except the Industrial Energy Audit which will
be carried out under the auspices of the Secretariat of Fuels of the Ministry
of Works and Public Service. For the execution of the Refinery Conversion
Scheme, and the Plant Operations Improvement Program, YPF has established a
Project Management Unit at its headquarters in Buenos Aires, supplemented by
two project teams--one at the La Plata Refinery and the other at the Lujan de
Cuyo Refinery. The Financial Management Improvement Program will be executed
under the supervision of the Finance Director of YPF with the assistance of
Arthur Andersen & Co. The proposed training program will be implemented under
the direction of the Training Manager of YPF.
5.23      The Refinery Conversion Scheme, the main component of the Project,
will be carried out in two phases. The Phase I includes basic process design
and engineering, detailed engineering for critical parts, and preparation of
bidding documents. Phase II will include detailed engineering, construction
and erection. Separate contractors will carry out Phase I and Phase II to
avoid conflict of interest. For Phase I, YPF has selected Foster Wheeler
International (FWI), of the U.S., a capable firm with extensive experience in
designing and building refinery projects, after following procedures satisfactory
to the Bank. FWI has selected Merox process for sulfur removal from LPG, Esso
Research (ERE) Process for fluid catalytic cracking and FWI's own technology
for delayed coking. These technologies are modern and commercially proven and



- 32 -
are acceptable. FWI will also serve as Technical Advisor to YPF during the
implementation of the Refinery Conversion Scheme and direct the start-up and
commissioning of the Scheme with the help of process and equipment vendors and
the engineering contractor. FWI will provide the process guarantees while the
engineering contractor will provide the mechanical guarantees for the Scheme.
FWI will assign specialists to the office of the engineering contractor to
supervise and approve detailed engineering and oversee the procurement work of
the contractor. FWI specialists will be supplemented with specialists from
YPF in carrying out this task.
5.24      As for Phase II, which includes detailed engineering, procurement of
equipment and supplies and construction, YPF considered three alternative
approaches to execution: (i) lumpsum turnkey contract restricting bidding to
only those prequalified contractors who have local subsidiaries and/or partners;
(ii) lump sum turnkey contract with bidding open to all prequalified contractors
irrespective of whether they have local subsidiaries and/or partners; and
(iii) fixed fee contract for detailed engineering and procurement services,
construction and erection, and with equipment to be procured under international
competitive bidding (ICB) on a reimbursable basis, with a bonus/penalty
clause for timely completion, and with bidding open to all prequalified
contractors. After detailed review of the three approaches mentioned, YPF has
opted for alternative (iii) which reflects the implementation arrangements
normally recommended by the Bank as most cost effective for process industries.
5.25      The Plant Operations Improvement Program which will be implemented
under the direct control of the Refinery Division Manager, Mr. Fabiani, with
technical assistance from TOTAL, of France, who carried out the study and made
recommendations for the improvement of the operations of the La Plata Refinery.
TOTAL recommendations for energy saving at La Plata are also applicable to
the Lujan de Cuyo Refinery.
5.26      The Financial Management Improvement Program will be carried out
under the direction of the Finance Director of YPF with technical assistance
from Arthur Andersen & Co. who carried out the financial management study
for YPF. The Training Program will be carried out under the direction of the
Training Manager of YPF in collaboration with TOTAL and Arthur Andersen.
Special attention will be paid to the training of YPF personnel in financial
management. As already noted, the Industrial Energy Audit will be carried
out with the help of consultants under the auspices of the Secretariat of
Fuels.



- 33 -
F.   Project Schedule
5.27      The implementation schedule for the Refinery Conversion Scheme
is given in Annex 5. The contract with FWI was signed by YPF on May 1, 1981
and the process packages and the bidding documents prepared by FWI will be
ready for release to potential engineering contractors by September 1981.
The potential bidders will be allowed six months to bid and the contract with
the selected engineering contractor is expected to be signed and become
effective by June 1982, the zero date for the Scheme. From the zero date,
the Scheme is expected to take 32 months until commissioning. On this basis,
the date for commercial production is assumed to be June 1985.
5.28      Implementation of the Plant Operations Improvement Program (POIP)
has already been initiated. The two components of this program which have
been selected for financing by the Bank, i.e., energy conservation and pollution
control components, are expected to be implemented over a four-year period
starting from April 1981. Implementation of the Financial Management Improvement
Program (FMIP) has also started and is scheduled for completion by December
1983. The Training Program will be implemented concurrently with the POIP
and FMIP. The Industrial Energy Audit will be carried out over a 12-month
period starting from September 1981 when the consulting firm for the audit is
expected to be selected.
G.   Staffing and Training
5.29      The Refinery Conversion Scheme is expected to employ at peak of
construction about 3,500 people and is estimated to require a permanent staff
of 320. The other parts of the Project are not expected to create additional
permanent employment as they are mostly improvement and training programs. A
number of key personnel have already been selected for project execution.
While most of the training of operators and maintenance crews under the
Training Program will be carried out in the existing YPF refineries, a limited
number of selected personnel will be trained at facilities abroad similar to
the arrangements under the Conversion Scheme and in vendors' workshops. This
Scheme as well as other components of the Project will also benefit from the
comprehensive training program to be financed by the Bank for the YPF Refinery
Division as a whole with special attention to operation and maintenance,
financial accounting and management.
H.   Environmental Considerations
5.30      The two sites for the Conversion Scheme differ quite considerably
from an environmental aspect. The refinery at Lujan de Cuyo has a very
modern plant for the handling of liquid effluents that was completed in 1979
at a cost of US$2.5 million. It involves API separators, flotation, oxidation
and biological treatment facilities. Sour water is stripped and neutralized
before it enters the treatment system. The effluent that is returned to
the Mendoza river meets the Argentinian specification for industrial effluents
(National Decree No. 2125/78), which is comparable to Bank recommended stan-
dards. The capacity of the treatment facilities will be expanded to handle
additional loads consequent upon the Conversion Scheme taking into account
the overcapacity presently available in existing facilities.



- 34 -
5.31      At La Plata there is clearly a liquid effluent problem and the TOTAL
report has recommended specific measures to reduce the contaminants to an
acceptable level. Those measures are included in the POIP. For the incre-
mental quantities of effluents from the Conversion Scheme, new facilities for
treatment to required standards will be created.
5.32      Air pollution at both sites is not a major problem because of the low
sulfur content of Argentine crude. However, in this regard as part of the POIP,
YPF will investigate the possibility of reduction and control of pollutant
emissions at source (stacks, tank farm and process units) to applicable norms
and will then take the necessary steps. Assurances have been obtained that
both refineries related to the Project will meet satisfactory environmental
standards.
VI. CAPITAL COST, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A.   Capital Cost Estimates
6.01      Total financing required for the Project including the Refinery
Conversion Scheme, the Operations Improvement Program, the Financial Management
Improvement Program, the Training Program and the Industrial Energy Audit, is
estimated at approximately US$878 million equivalent of which US$439 million
would be in foreign exchange. The capital cost estimates, details of which are
given in Annex 6-1, are summarized in the table on the following page.
6.02      The base cost estimate for the Refinery Conversion Scheme is expressed
in May 1981 prices and is derived from estimates made in October 1980 by
Foster Wheeler International (FWI) based on data for a similar facility FWI is
currently implementing in Spain, having already procured the equipment and
bulk of materials. Basic information on the location factor for Argentina was
developed by the FWI office in Buenos Aires. Adjustments were made for the
differences in soil conditions and the ocean and inland freight costs for the
two refinery locations. The cost estimates are based on the assumption that
the Government would allow exemption from the Compre Argentino regulations
for the Project in line with other Bank-financed projects (e.g., Segba Hydro-
electric Project) and no customs duties, value added tax, or consular charges
would be payable on equipment and materials imported for the Project. The
estimates include (i) a physical contingency of 10%; and (ii) price escalation
for foreign costs based on the forecast of international inflation rates in
dollar terms of 9% for the last eight months of 1981, 8.5% for 1982 and 7.5%
for 1983 and onwards; the same international rates have been used for local
equipment and materials assuming that the difference in the domestic and
international rates will be accounted for by adjustments in the foreign
exchange rate. On civil works and erection, however, in the light of ex-
perience in recent years, higher annual increases in dollar terms have been
used: 20% for the last eight months of 1981, declining to 8% in 1982 and
onwards. Initial working capital requirements for the Project are estimated
at US$22.4 million equivalent excluding the cost of spare parts for two years
which are included under the equipment and material costs (Annex 6-2).



- 35 -
6.03      The financing requirements for the Plant Operations Improvement
Program are estimated at US$50 million (including US$26 million in foreign
exchange) based on estimates prepared by TOTAL. The cost estimates for the
Financial Management Improvement Program and the Training Program have been
prepared by the Bank in consultation with YPF and Arthur Andersen & Co. The
cost of the Industrial Energy Audit has been estimated in consultation with
the Secretariat of Fuels.

a/   For the Industrial Energy Audit.
b/   Including US$0.2 million equivalent for the Industrial Energy Audit.
6.05      The Project is expected to be financed on a 71/29 debt/equity
ratio. The proposed Bank loan of US$200 million will cover nearly 23% of
the total costs. YPF will borrow an additional US$421 million equivalent by way
of export credits and commercial bank loans from foreign sources. YPF has
received offers from a number of international merchant and commercial banks for
arranging necessary funds. The commercial loans are expected to be made under
cofinancing arrangements with the Bank loan.
6.06      Of the Bank loan of US$200 million, US$198 million is proposed to
be extended to YPF and US$2 million to the Government (for the Industrial
Energy Audit) for 14 years including three and one-half years of grace at
the prevailing rate of interest. An interest equalization fee of 10% of the



- 37 -
Bank lending rate on top of the Bank's standard lending rate will be charged
to YPF. The Government will bear the cross exchange risk between the currencies
disbursed by the Bank and the US dollar. YPF will bear the exchange risk
between the US dollar and Argentine peso. Of the additional external financing
of US$421 million for the Project, about 35% is likely to be in export credits
and the rest in commercial bank loans. Export credits are expected to be for 14
years at 8.5% interest per annum, with the repayment of principal to begin six
months after the forecast start-up of the Project. The down payment of 15% on
export credits will be met from commercial loans. Commercial loans will also
cover all other financing requirements not covered by the Bank, export credits
and equity. It is assumed that these commercial loans would be for eight years
with interest about 7/8% above LIBOR which is assumed to average 14% during the
implementation period of the Project.
6.07      On the basis of the financing plan given above, the Project will
require about US$257 million equivalent from internally generated funds of YPF
or government funds. The financial projections indicate that YPF should be
able to generate these funds during the project implementation period.
However, because of the Government's substantial influence on the prices of
petroleum products and to ensure availability of necessary resources to
complete the Project, assurances have been received from the Government that it
will meet any shortfall in funds to finance the Project.
C.   Procurement
6.08      The engineering contractor selected will be responsible for pro-
curement of equipment. With its help YPF will prepare a list of goods and
services for financing with export credits under competitive bidding by
countries providing such credits. The rest of the items will be procured
under the international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures of the Bank
except for: (i) items costing less than US$100,000 equivalent each, not
exceeding the aggregate amount of US$4 million, which will be procured by
international shopping subject to the prior approval by the Bank of the list
of items involved; and (ii) agreed proprietary and process and time critical
items, whose aggregate cost is estimated not to exceed US$20 million, which
will also be procured through international shopping. A preference of 15% or
the customs duty, whichever is lower, will be allowed to qualified local
manufacturers bidding under the ICB procedures. Construction and civil works
will be bid competitively as part of the main engineering contract under
consortium arrangements.
D.   Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
6.09      The final make-up of the items for Bank financing will be determined
by the supply capacity and price competitiveness of the potential export
credit sources, and the final recommendations of the engineering contractor.
;entative allocation of the Bank loan is given below:

a! For foreign expenditures 100% of c.i.f. value and for local expenditures
100% of ex-factory value. Except for the Engineering and Licences category,
both foreign and local expenditures will be eligible for Bank financing.
6.10      About 30% of the Bank loan is expected to be disbursed against local
currency expenditures. The Bank loan would be used to finance the FWI contract
and part of the main engineering contract including local currency costs.
Retroactive financing of US$8 million is envisaged to meet expenditures
incurred from May 1, 1981, by way of initial payments on:  (i) the FWI contract
(which became effective May 1, 1981) to have Bank participation in this
crucial contract for basic engineering; and (ii) on the Plant Operations
Improvement Program which is already underway. The Bank loan is expected to
be disbursed fully by June 30, 1985, according to the schedule presented in
Annex 6-3. Any surplus funds remaining in the loan account after project
completion will be cancelled.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Production and Production Costs
7.01      The financial analysis of the Project is done in current terms in
US$ and the major assumptions are detailed in Annex 7-1. This analysis
considers only the results of the conversion facilities to be installed under
the Project. For preparing the financial analysis of the Refinery Division,
the financial performance of the Project is consolidated with the existing
operations, including present facilities at the La Plata and Lujan de Cuyo
refineries.



- 39 -
7.02      It is assumed that the Project will start commercial production on
June 1, 1985 with capacity utilization increasing gradually from 60% in the
first year of operation to 80% in the second and 95% in the third and sub-
sequent years. Because of the Company's experience in operating its existing
facilities at high capacity and the provision for training under the Project,
the attainment of 95% capacity utilization from the third year of operation is
considered realistic.
7.03      Fuel oil is the major input for the Project.  At 95% operation, it
will convert about 4.2 million tpy of fuel oil--2.5 million tons from the La
Plata Refinery and 1.7 million tpy from the Lujan de Cuyo Refinery--into
approximately 3.9 million tpy of higher-value petroleum products such as
gasoline, gas oil and diesel oil, LPG, kerosene and coke. In addition, it
will produce 224,500 tons of refinery gas as a by-product, a large part of
which will be used internally to replace fuel oil in the production of utilities
and the surplus would be supplied to the nearby power plants. The price of
fuel oil as well as of other petroleum products is fixed by the Government.
As of May 1, 1981, the local fuel oil prices per ton were equivalent to
US$90 ex-refinery and US$126 retail. Labor costs are based on prevailing
salary scales in YPF refineries. Utility costs are based on prevailing unit
rates in Argentina. Maintenance and insurance costs are estimated at 4% and
1.5%, respectively, of the total capital investments on machinery, building
and civil works, and construction and erection. Depreciation is calculated on
a straight-line basis on the assumed 12-year life of the Project. General and
administrative costs are assumed to be one-third of the payroll cost.
7.04      The following table (derived from Annex 7-2) shows the annual
production costs of the Project at 95% capacity utilization:
Project: Annual Production Costs at 95% Capacity Utilization
(in May 1981 terms)
US$ million           Percentage (%)
Fuel Oil                                     356.7                     66.7

Depreciation                                  67.0                     12.5
Financial Charges                             59.6                     11.1
Insurance                                      6.2                      1.1
General and Administrative                     1.0                      0.4
535.0                   100.0
At 95% capacity utilization, the principal input, fuel oil, is expected
to account for 67% of the production costs (including depreciation and
financial charges). Depreciation and financial charges represent only 24% of
the total, reflecting low investment cost per unit of output of the Project
compared to a grassroot refinery.



- 40 -
B.   Revenues
7.05      As noted, Argentine ex-refinery prices as well as retail prices
for petroleum products are controlled by the Government, which, during January
1980-March 1981, increased those prices at an average monthly rate of 1.8% in
real terms above the non-agricultural whole-sale prices. 1/ This helped check
the deterioration in real prices in the face of high inflation (85% in 1980)
and achieve a real increase of 2% over the consumer price index in 1980. The
current Government policy of granting price increases to public sector under-
takings aims at compensating them for the real increases in their cost of
production and encourage them to cut production costs by increasing their
efficiency of operation. To achieve this, the Government follows the non-
agricultural price index, not the consumer price index, as the representative
index for price adjustment. Further, the Government is committed to set
ex-refinery product prices at a level that would allow YPF to cover all its
costs and expenses before interest, and to earn a reasonable rate of return on
its revalued net fixed assets in operation. Revenue projections for the
Project and YPF's Refinery Division are based on this new pricing policy.2/
C.   Financial Projections for the Project
7.06      Financial projections for the Project based on the above assumptions
are given in Annex 7-3, and summarized below:

- 41 -
7.07      Total revenues of the Project are expected to increase froni US$386
million in 1985 to US$920 million in 1987 when the maximum capacity utilization
(i.e., 95%) is expected to be reached. The Project is expected to show
profits from the first year of operation; and the return on sales is expected
to average around 10.5%. The Project is expected to generate adequate cash to
more than meet its debt service obligations.
D.   Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
7.08      The cost and benefit streams for the financial internal rate of
return (IRR) are shown in Annex 7-4. The return is satisfacctory at 24.6%
before tax and 17.2% after tax.  The financial rate of return is sensitive to

a! Net of revaluation surplus.
Sales of the Refinery Division are expected to increase sharply from 1985
due primarily to the commissioning of the Project. The share of the Project
in total sales revenue is expected to increase from 15% in 1985 to 23% in 1987
with the production build-up in the Project. The debt/equity ratio of the
Refinery Division reaches 21/79 in 1985 and declines subsequently to 15/85 in
1987, with repayment of debt and increased retained earnings, provided no
further expansion is undertaken.
7.10      The projections show that the quick ratio would be low at 0.3:1 if
surplus cash which builds up impressively is excluded from the ratio calculation.
Therefore, YPF and the Government (the shareholder) would need to allocate
sufficient funds from surplus cash to current assets to maintain the quick
ratio at least 0.6:1. Should the anticipated surplus cash fail to materialize,
YPF and the Government will have to provide necessary funds to help YPF
maintain a quick ratio at that level (para 7.12). Even after allocation of
surplus cash to current assets, there would be, according to the



- 43 -
projections, excess funds which are expected to be used by YPF to finance part
of investments on oil exploration and production. Should there be surplus even
after this, it is expected to be partly distributed as dividends to the Govern-
ment and partly retained in the Company for future investments.
F.   Financial Covenants for the Company
7.11      Financial statements for the Company show a satisfactory debt/equity
ratio (42/58 at the end of 1980) but the ability of the Company to generate
cash to firnance large new investments in oil exploration and production are
limited, particularly because of inadequate crude oil prices. As noted, an
understanding has been reached with the Government that domestic crude oil
prices paid to YPF will be raised to levels comparable to those paid to private
petroleum companies under risk sharing contracts negotiated by the Government
in 1980 and that domestic price of petroleum products will be maintained, in
real terms at May 1, 1981 levels using the non-agricultural wholesale
price index for periodic adjustment of retail prices. Agreement has also been
reached with the Government that ex-refinery product prices will be set at
levels that will provide YPF, operating efficiently, with funds sufficient to
cover all its costs and expenses before interest, to earn a reasonable
return on its revalued net fixed assets in service, and to meet sound financial
ratios (para 7.12), and that inter-product price levels and natural gas prices
will be rationalized following the completion of the Gas Utilization Study.
7.12      As of the end of 1980, the quick ratio of YPF was 0.7:1.  With this
ratio, the Company was able to function because of its current practice of
collecting sales and related taxes and using them as working capital for about
five weeks (as officially allowed) before paying them to the Government.
Agreement has been reached with the Government and the Company that YPF will
maintain at all times a quick ratio of at least 0.6 to 1. Further, the following
agreements have been reached with YPF and the Government: the Company will (i)
not incur any long-term and/or roll-over short-term debt, if, after incurring
such debt, the debt/equity ratio of the Company will exceed 60/40; (ii) maintain
a projected debt service coverage of at least 1.4 times; and (iii) not, without
prior Bank consent, declare dividends or make any other cash distributions if,
after such payments, the quick ratio falls below 0.8 to 1. Currently, YPF
prepares financial projections for the Company for three months. To facilitate
sound financial planning and capital budgeting, the Company will prepare and
submit to the Bank 12-month financial projections within four months of the end
of every fiscal year. It was agreed that the system will be introduced by YPF
by 1982 with the first such projection due by end of April 1983 (para. 3.18).
G.   Auditing and Reporting Requirements
7.13      The Company's accounts are audited by the Sindicatura General de
Empresas Publicas, a Government auditing agency. Three officials of the
Sindicatura are assigned to YPF who attend Board meetings and have the authority
to call special meetings of the Board if there are any serious issues. YPF
will submit to the Bank audited annual financial reports within six months of
the end of each fiscal year and will give prompt attention to audit recommen-
dations. The audit reports will contain comments by the auditors whether the
covenants in the Loan Agreement for the new Refinery Conversion Scheme are
complied with. In addition to the annual audit reports, the Company will
submit quarterly financial statements within 75 days after the end of each
quarter and until Project Completion monthly project progress and procurement
status reports in the format and scope agreed with the Bank. Finally, within



- 44 -
four months after the Closing Date of the Project, the Company will prepare and
furnish to the Bank a Completion Report on the Project dealing with its implementa-
tion, initial operation, and the costs and benefits derived and expected to be
derived.
H.   Major Risks
7.14      Risks associated with project technology, start-up and operations
are moderate, as the Project is based on commercially proven technology, and
adequate arrangements have been made under the Project for training personnel
for operation and maintenance. However, commissioning problems and difficul-
ties in attaining and maintaining a high operating rate cannot be ruled out.
Considering the involvement of capable and experienced engineering and operating
firms in the design, engineering, construction, erection commissioning and
operations of the Project and the Company's experience in operating the
existing refineries at high capacity, the risk of abnormal problems, shut-downs
and low operating rate is not, however, considered serious.
7.15      The main risks associated with the Project concern potential delays
in implementation, particularly civil works, and inadequate cost controls due
to shortcomings in financial management. However, these risks have been
reduced by: strenghtening the Project Team with technical advisory services
from FWI during the entire period of project development, implementation and
initial operation; involving capable and experienced firms for project design,
engineering and implementation; prequalifying local construction firms with
particular attention to their past performance in Argentina; and introducing
cost control systems with the help of Arthur Andersen & Co. Further, the
project management aspect will be continuously monitored by the Bank during
project implementation.
7.16      No significant commercial risk is foreseen.  Even on the basis of
conservative market forecasts, the production capacity of the Project falls
short of the expected demand except for sponge and acicular coke. YPF has
already entered into a long-term contract with Great Lakes Carbon, of the
U.S., to sell 250,000 tons per year of sponge coke. An additional 178,500
tons of sponge coke as well as 123,000 tons of acicular coke are likely to be
available annually for exports at 95% operation. As demand for sponge and
acicular coke is growing in the world because of the expansion of steel and
aluminum production, no major problem is foreseen in exporting them.
7.17      The financing plan assumes that about US$257.4 million equivalent
(29% of the total financing required) will come from internally generated
funds of YPF; the ability to do so, however, depends on the Government allowing
YPF prices adequate to earn a reasonable return on investment at efficient
production. Measures have already been taken by the Government toward this
objective. Should the internally generated funds fall short of the require-
ments, the Government will meet the deficit by injecting the necessary funds
by way of additional share capital.
7.18      An external risk facing the Project is that it depends on the timely
completion of a complementary project--a crude oil pipeline--which is critical
to ensure adequate supply of crude oil to the Lujan de Cuyo Refinery. To
diminish this risk, assurances have been received from the Government that the
facilities for transporting crude oil from Neuquen to Lujan de Cuyo will be
completed in time for the Project.

VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Economic Justification
8.01      YPF has six refineries of which only three, La Plata, Lujan de
Cuyo and San Lorenzo have conversion facilities so far. About 40% of the
product mix of the La Plata Refinery and 25% of that of Lujan de Cuyo are
residual fuel oil. In 1979 the La Plata and Lujan de Cuyo accounted for 38.4
million barrels (5 million tons) of residual fuel oil--about 68% of the total
for the country in that year. The Refinery Conversion Scheme is designed to
convert the surplus low-value residual fuel oil into higher-value lighter
refinery products such as gasoline, jet fuel, gas oil and diesel oil.
Currently, Argentina is surplus in residual fuel oil but deficit in lighter
refinery products. The Conversion Scheme would help reduce the need for
imports of lighter products by helping YPF achieve a better balance in the
product mix in the two refineries.
B.   World Petroleum Prices
8.02      A review of long-term inter-product prices for refinery products
in the world shows the following approximate relationship assuming the crude
oil price as 100: Gas, 137; motor gasoline (96 RON), 150; kerosene, 140; jet
fuel, LPG, gas oil and diesel, 133; and fuel oil, 74. By applying the above
indices to the mid-1980 crude oil price of US$257/ton (US$35/bbl), the following
refinery product prices and derived:
Estimated Prices Per Ton of Selected Refinery Products
(May 1981 US$ in real terms)
Gas                                    352
LPG                                     342
Gasoline (Premium)                      385
Gasoline (Regular)                      373 a/
Kerosene and Jet Fuel                   360
Gas Oil and Diesel Fuel                 342
Fuel Oil                                190
a/   Assumed at 97% of the premium gasoline price.
The above prices have been used for the economic rate of return calculation.
However, the actual prices of petroleum products may periodically vary from
these general relationships because of periodic distortions in the supply
and demand for particular petroleum products.



- 46 -
C.   Transportation Savings
8.03      At full production of the Project, Argentina would overcome the need
for importing about 3.9 million tons of light petroleum products per year, thus
saving the country about US$119 milion (calculated on the basis of US$30/ton
savings in freight, port handling and inland transportation differential). In
addition, the Project would avoid the need to transport about 1.7 million tons
of fuel oil from Lujan de Cuyo to Buenos Aires for export. This would save
annually another US$26 million equivalent in fuel oil transportation cost
(assuming it costs US$15/ton for transporting fuel oil from Lujan de Cuyo to
Buenos Aires). Thus the gross annual transportation savings to Argentina
because-of the Project would be US$145 million.
D.   Economic Rate of Return
8.04      Detailed assumptions used in the economic rate of return calcula-
tions are shown in Annexes 8-1 and 8-2. The benefit stream is based on the
price and transport cost savings assumptions discussed above (para 8.03).
Operating costs have been derived by making appropriate adjustment to the
financial costs to reflect the opportunity costs of the inputs; no shadow
pricing is used for labor cost as the Project will employ mostly skilled
employees. Transfer payments such as taxes and financial charges have been
excluded.  Based on the assumptions outlined above and assuming a 12-year life
for the Project, the economic rate of return of the Project is estimated at
48%. Sensitivity tests carried out on the economic rate of return show the
following results:
Argentina - Sensitivity Tests on Economic Rate of Return
Assumptions                              Rate of Return (%)
1.   Base Case                                         48.2
2.   Capital Costs up 10%                              45.5
3.   Capital Costs up 20%                              43.2
4.   Operating Costs up 10%                            44.8
5.   Operating Costs up 20%                            41.1
6.   Benefits down 10%                                 41.6
7.   Benefits down 20%                                 33.7
8.   One-Year Project Delay                            48.0
9.   Attainment of only 85% Capacity Utilization   46.4
10.   Attainment of only 75% Capacity Utilization   44.6
11.   Combination of (3) and (8)                        43.0
12.   Combination of (3), (8) and (10)                  39.5
As shown in the above table, the economic rate of return is sensitive to
changes in refinery product prices, capital and operating costs, delays in
construction, and capacity utilization. A 20% drop in revenue would reduce
the return to 34%. A one-year delay in the Project combined with a 20%
capital cost increase and the ultimate attainment of only 75% capacity utiliza-
tion (as against 95% assumed) would reduce the return to 40%. Therefore, even
under conceivable adverse conditions, the Project still yields an attractive
economic rate of return.



- 47 -
E.   Foreign Exchange Benefits
8.05      In 1981 terms, the net foreign exchange outflow due to the Refinery
Conversion Scheme during the construction period (1981-84) would be about
US$74 million. However, the net outflow turns into a significant net foreign
exchange savings of about US$156 million in 1985, with the expected start-up
of the Scheme in June 1985. The annual net savings would rise to US$722
million in 1987 as the Scheme attains 95% capacity utilization. The net
savings would steadily increase further as the debt service obligation
declines over the years.
F.   Other Economic Benefits
8.06      Operations of the existing YPF refineries at La Plata and Lujan de
Cuyo are expected to be improved as a result of the Plant Operations Improvement
Program prepared and to be implemented with the help of TOTAL of France. The
management and organization of YPF will be streamlined with the implementation
of the Financial Management Improvement Program prepared by Arthur Andersen.
Further, as a part of an institution-building effort, YPF staff will be trained
in modern practices of refinery operation and maintenance, accounting and
financial management. Finally, the efforts of the Government for energy conser-
vation will be accelerated through a study on energy conservation prospects
in the petrochemical and other industrial sectors. Based upon the study, an
energy conservation program for the industrial sector will be developed and
implemented.
IX. AGREEMENTS
9.01      The following major agreements have been reached:
A.   From the Government that it will:
(i)  prepare a program for implementing the recommendations
of the Industrial Energy Audit by December 31, 1982
(paras 2.18 and 5.11);
(ii)  take measures to ensure that the ex-refinery prices of
YPF's products are adequate to provide YPF, operating
efficiently, with funds sufficient to cover all its costs
and expenses before interest, to earn a reasonable return
on its revalued net fixed assets in service and to meet
sound financial ratios (paras 3.17, 4.21, 7.11 and 7.12); and
(iii)  meet any shortfall in funds to finance the Project (para 6.07).



- 48 -
B.   From the Government and the Company that they will:
(i) exchange views periodically with the Bank on the plans for
expanding the refinery capacity in Argentina (para 4.10);
(ii) expand the transport capacity of the product pipeline for
the Lujan de Cuyo refinery in time for the Conversion Scheme
(para 4.13);
(iii) finalize the marketing improvement plan by March 31, 1982 and
carry out the plan by June 30, 1985 (para 4.17);
(iv) construct in time for the proposed conversion facility at
Lujan de Cuyo refinery the facilities for the transport of
crude oil from Neuquen (para 5.13);
(v) make adequate arrangements to meet the crude oil require-
ments of La Plata and Lujan de Cuyo refineries (para 5.15);
(vi) ensure that both refineries related to the Project will meet
satisfactory environmental standards (para 5.32); and
(vii)   ensure that YPF will follow prudent financial practices and
abide by the financial, auditing and reporting covenants, as
enumerated in paras 7.11, 7.12, and 7.13).
9.02      Based on the above agreements reached, the Project is considered
suitable for a Bank loan of US$200 million equivalent on terms discussed in
para 6.06.

ANNEX 7-1
ARGENTINA: REFINERY CONVERSION PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Financial Projections
1.        The Argentine economy is characterized by high inflation.  In
this context, in order to reflect a reasonably accurate picture of YPF's
financial obligation, cash generation and liquidity situation, the financial
projections are made in current US$ terms. The output prices as well as
production costs in current terms are projected to increase at an average
rate of 9% in 1981, 8.5% in 1982, 7.5% during 1983-85, and 6% in 1985 and
onwards.
B. Inflation Accounting
2.        Early in 1975, the Argentine Institute of Public Accountants issued
a decree 1/ to regulate the use of monetary and non-monetary correction
factors in the financial statement of public and private companies. This
decree called for (i) the restatement of all operating costs and revenues
of the current accounting year according to an index based on the level of
inflation at the close of the year; (ii) revaluation of all non-monetary
assets and liabilities according to an index based on the level of inflation
at the close of the accounting year, and (iii) adjustment of all liabilities
in foreign currencies based on the actual exchange rates at the close of the
year.
3         For the purpose of the financial projections, (i) above was applied
with the exception that instead of the domestic monetary correction factor,
the international inflation rate was applied as indexing factor. All revenues
and expenses were calculated in terms of constant May 1981 dollars and then
inflated to current US dollars. The computation of the indexed values of
fixed assets, as required by (ii) above, was done by accumulating the yearly
amounts and then inflating these accumulated amounts by the same indexing
factor used for revenues and expenses (i.e., international price inflation
rate). The difference between the indexed and yearly amounts was then credited
as revaluation surplus. Since the financial projections are expressed in
current US$, adjustments as mentioned under (iii) above reflecting increases in interest
charges and principal repayments for foreign loans due to changes in exchange
rate, are not applicable.

C. Product Mix
4.        The Project is assumed to start commercial operations June 1, 1985,
with a production build-up of 60%, 80% and 95% of capacity for the first,
second, and third operating years, respectively. The product mix at 95%
capacity utilization would be as follows:
Product Mix at 95% Capacity Utilization

Total Production      2,321.8          1,439.7           3,761.5
D. Product Prices
5.        During 1974-79, local selling prices of petroleum products set
by the Government declined in real terms. As a result, average selling price
in 1979 in real terms was about 20% lower than that in 1974. To improve the
situation, the Government, in January 1980, decided to increase selling prices
of petroleum products by an average of 1.8% per month in real terms over and
above the increase in wholesale prices of non-agricultural products. This
program of price increases was continued until the end of March 1981 when the
new Government came into power. The new Government has agreed to maintain
retail prices in real terms at May 1, 1981 levels. Further, it has agreed
to ensure that, at efficient operation, YPF will get adequate funds to
meet all its costs and expenses before interest, earn a reasonable return
(about 10% by 1983) on revalued net fixed assets in operation, and meet
sound financial ratios. The revenue projections are based on the assumption
that ex-refinery prices will be increased gradually in real terms from the
May 1, 1981 level to allow, by 1983, a 10% rate of return on revalued net
fixed assets.
E. Production Costs
6         Financial production costs are detailed in Annex 7-2.  Economic
costs are also shown for comparison. Requirements for raw materials and
utilities were estimated by YPF's engineering staff and Foster Wheeler and
verified by the Bank based on the experience of existing plants elsewhere
of similar size and processes.

7.        Incremental labor requirements were estimated by YPF.  Average
annual salary per person based upon the present pay level within Argentina's
refinery industry is about US$10,000. Annual insurance and maintenance
expenses are estimated at 1% and 4%, respectively, of the total capital investments
in equipment, machinery, erection, construction, building and civil works.
General and administrative expenses are estimated at about one third of
payroll cost. Depreciation of fixed assets is computed on a straight-line
basis using an economic project life of 12 years.
F. Interest Charges
8.        The assumptions used for calculating debt service for the Project
are given below:
Amount                   Terms
(US$ million)
IBRD                          200          11% p.a.; 14 years, including
3 1/2 years' grace period.
Commercial Bank and           421 -/       14% p.a., 8 years. 4 years' grace
Export Credits                           for commercial bank loans; 8.5%, 14 years,
3 1/2 years' grace for export credits.
G. Income Taxes
9.        In the past, contributions to the Government had been fixed by the
Government annually as a percentage rate of YPF's operating and investment
costs. This percentage rate had been variable, and, in 1979, it ammounted to
about 14%. From January 1, 1980, however, YPF is subject to a corporate income
tax of 33%.
H. Financial Return
10.       Annex 7-4 gives a breakdown of the financial costs and benefits
of the Project. The results of sensitivity tests are given in para. 7.09
of the main text. The financial rates of return of the Project are 24.6%
before taxes and 17.2% after taxes.
Including US$175 million for the Refinery Conversion Scheme and the rest
for the other components of the Project.

ANNEX 8-1
ARGENTINA - REFINERY CONVERSION PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. General
1.        The economic rates of return for the Project are calculated in
constant May 1981 dollars. Project life is assumed at 12 years with no
terminal value credited to the Project except that for working capital
recovery.
B.  Capital Cost Estimate
2.        The economic capital cost of the Project is obtained by deflating
the financial installed cost in current prices to May 1981 prices:
Disbursement                              Economic

C.        Working Capital
3.        Economic working capital is estimated at US$15.4 million and includes
inventories of raw materials and works in process. (ANNEX 6-2)

D. Operating Costs
4.        Economic input costs as of May 1981 are detailed in
Annex 7-2. Labor, maintenance and other operating costs are base on those
used for financial analysis.
E. Economic Benefits
5.        Product prices used in the economic analysis are based on a recent
Bank study 1/ of long-term inter-product prices for refinery products which
shows the following relationships, assuming crude oil price at 100: motor
gasoline, 150; naphtha, 135; gas, 137; kerosene, 140; LPG, gas oil and diesel
oil, 133; and fuel oil, 74. At the long-term world crude oil price of US$257/ton
(US$35/bbl) the following refinery product long-term prices are derived:
FOB
US$/ton
Premium Gasoline                       385
Regular Gasoline a/                    373
Kerosene                               360
Gas and Diesel Oil                     342
Fuel Oil                               190
Refinery Gas                           352
LPG                                    342
a/ Assumed at 97% or premium gasoline price.
Acicular and sponge coke are valued at the FOB Rotterdam prices of US$430
and US$375/ton, respectively.
8.        At full production, the Project will produce about 4 million tons of
light refinery products which would otherwise be imported. With freight, port
handling and inland transportation costs averaging about US$30/ton, the Project
would save the country about US$119 million per year. In addition, the
conversion project at Lujan de Cuyo refinery will save the country another
US$26 million per year, which is the cost of transporting the 1.7 million tons
of fuel oil produced by the refinery to Buenos Aires for export if such fuel
oil is not converted. Total annual transportation savings resulting from the
Project at full prodution thus amount to about US$145 million at 1980 terms.
