MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Argentina
Refinery Conversion Project
(Loans 2032-AR and 2032-1-AR)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on Argentina - Refinery
Conversion Project (Loans 2032-AR and 2032-1-AR)" prepared by the Latin America
and the Caribbean Regional Office. Part II was extracted from the conclusions
of the Borrower's report.   The Project Completion Report  is informative.
However, the re-estimated economic return is based on questionable pricing
assumptions. Furthermore, the Report fails to emphasize the inadequacy of the
financial appraisal carried out by the Bank and does not document the present
status with financial statements.
The project, the third one in Argentina's oil & gas sector, essentially
achieved its physical objectives, albeit with significant delays and some cost
overruns. However the country's mounting economic crisis and inappropriate
Government petroleum pricing policies resulted in a severe deterioration of the
national oil company's finances; as a result, the Government failed to meet its
commitment on fuel pricing and the oil company was unable to meet its financial
covenants. This also led to a complete restructuring of the financing package
for the project and the need for the Bank to process a supplementary loan.
Some useful studies and training activities were carried out but energy
conservation studies were not. Overall, the project is rated as unsatisfactory,
its institutional impact as partial, and its long-term sustainability as
uncertain, as it depends on the outcome of a recently-initiated financial
rehabilitation (and possible privatization) of the national oil company.
A combined audit of the Bank's three oil & gas loans to Argentina is
planned.

REFINERY CONVERSION PROJECT
(LOANS 2032-AR AND 2032-1-AR)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Refinery Conversion
Project in Argentina, for which Loan 2032-AR and 2032-1-AR were approved, in the
amounts of US$200 million for the first, on August 7, 1981, and an additional
US$116 million in December 1986, (Loan 2032-1-AR), to supplement foreign exchange
financing of the project.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy Division of
Country Department IV of the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office
(Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III), and by the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR is based, inter alia, on the President's
Report; the Loan, Guarantee, and Project Agreements; supervision reports;
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ARGENTINA
REFINERY CONVERSION PROJECT
(LOANS 2032-AR AND 2032-1-AR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
1.       The project was designed to support the overall energy sector investment
program, heavily based on the development of natural gas resource, while
providing means for significant savings of foreign exchange. The main objectives
of the Project were: (i) to convert Argentina's substantial surplus low-value
residual fuel oil to higher-value refinery products, which were in short supply;
(ii) improve the performance of YPF's major refineries; (iii) strengthen the
company's financial management system; (iv) train YPF operational staff, and (v)
study the potential for energy saving in the industrial sector.
2.       The project consisted of: (i) Refineries Conversion Scheme: installation
of secondary processing facilities at YPF's two existing refineries located in
La Plata and Lujan de Cuyo;    (ii)  Plant Operations  Improvement Program:
debottlenecking of process and utilities sections of the refineries, installation
of energy conservation, pollution control, and instrumentation modernization
facilities; (iii) Financial Management Improvement and Training Programs:
establishing standard cost accounting system, cost centers, capital budgeting and
financial management improvements, as well as associated training of YPF
personnel in these areas; and (iv) Industrial Energy Conservation Study:
conducting energy audits in identified large and medium-scale industrial units,
and establishing a national industrial energy conservation center, covering all
major industrial sectors in the country, and training of personnel in energy
conservation. (See para. 5).
Implementation Experience and Results
3.       The original US$200 million loan was approved in August 1981.   A
supplementary loan for US$116 million was approved in December 1986. Overall
implementation of the project got off to a late start primarily because of the
military confrontation in the South Atlantic. It also took longer than expected
to complete the basic engineering for the conversion activities. Subsequently,
as a result of the efforts of YPF's project unit, aided by two international
consortia, execution of the project proceeded satisfactorily. In 1986, by YPF's
request and prompted by its precarious financial situation, the Bank approved a
supplementary loan of US$116 million, to help finance a portion of the foreign
exchange cost of the conversion works and to help YPF strengthen its financial
and other management controls. The Eximbank of Japan also provided cofinancing
through a loan of US$180 million equivalent.
4.       The loan was fully disbursed and all primary activities were completed.
The loan was closed in December 1989, two years later than planned, and physical
execution was completed in October 1990.



- iii -
5.       The starting-up of the conversion units has resulted in a 23 percent
reduction in the production of fuel oil, a 10 percent increase in naphtha, and
a 17 percent increase in intermediate distillates. These improvements translate
into a reduction of 4 million tons of fuel oil and an increase of 3 million cubic
meters in the production of light and intermediate distillates. The Industrial
Energy Conservation Study was not implemented, due to changes in priorities as
counterpart financial resources became scarce. A study of YPF's financial and
accounting practices was performed and the recommendations made by the consultant
on the establishment of a cost center and cost control systems, were implemented
only at the Lujan de Cuyo refinery. (See para. 8).
Findings and Lessons
6.       Due to the sensitivity of project economic performance to the evolution
of crude oil and refined product to higher prices, the sector should develop or
improve institutional and marketing capabilities to respond quickly and flexibly
to market conditions.
7.       While the physical execution of this project was successful, it suffered
serious difficulties as a result of the country's economic instability,
exacerbated by a non-supporting pricing and taxation policy, which prevented
achievement of financial and institutional goals.   The Government's pricing
policies for crude oil, liquid fluids and natural gas are critical for the future
of energy planning and development of the hydrocarbon industry in Argentina.
(See paras. 37 and 38).

RVP Unit       : Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office
Country        : Argentina
Sector         : Energy
Subsector      : Oil and Gas
Background
I.       Argentina's energy resources are substantial and diverse.  They include
crude oil, natural gas, and hydropower, as well as coal and uranium.  Recent
technical evaluations indicate, however, that the hydrocarbon proven reserves are
not as large as had originally been estimated. Proven oil reserves in Argentina
have been revised downward by 20%. Since 1984, over three-fourths of the energy
produced in the country was obtained from hydrocarbon sources; the remainder was
provided by hydropower, nuclear biomass, coal, and other sources. These resources
have been developed primarily by the State. Petroleum output declined during the
1980s, mainly because of lack of adequate Government investments.   Although
production increased in 1988 and in 1990, the trend of declining production and
diminishing proven reserves will return unless new investments in exploration and
development are made.
2.       The Borrower, Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales, (YPF), is the former
State-owned petroleum company organized under the Secretariat of Energy, within
the Ministry of Public Works. The company had a corporate structure similar to
a private corporation, with the Government as the only shareholder.   It was
established in 1922 as a Government Department (a predecessor organization had
begun operations in 1907.) In 1977 it was separated from the Ministry and
converted into a State Corporation.  It was the largest enterprise in Argentina
and one of the largest oil companies in Latin America. YPF was in control of all
the exploration and production of hydrocarbons, and the majority of refining and
marketing activities in Argentina. Much of the difficulties in the sector have
been concerned with the role of YPF, on which the Government depended for the
implementation  of  a  petroleum  self-sufficiency  policy.    YPF  operating
deficiencies mainly resulted from erratic pricing and taxation policies and
inconsistent Government oversight.
3.       In order to develop the full potential of the sector and to secure
future energy needs, in 1989 the Government took serious steps aiming, among
other things, at restructuring YPF organization and redefining its role vis-a-vis
the private sector, in order to trim inefficient operations and reduce public



- 2 -
investment cost. The Government deregulated crude oil and refined product prices
and trade, opening competition at all levels and attracting private investors.
YPF was transformed from a State Enterprise into a shareholding corporation
(YPFSA), with the view to its becoming commercially viable, financially self-
sustaining, and in the medium-term, privately owned, through the sale of its
shares. This requires a major structural reorganization that has been initiated.
4.       This project was the third Bank operation in the oil and gas sector in
Argentina.   The first loan was for the Oil and Gas Engineering Project for
US$27.5 million (Loan 1880-AR), aimed at (i) improving information on country-
wide oil and natural gas reserves, (ii) assist YPF in locating favorable
geological hydrocarbon structures; and (iii) to study the optimum development and
utilization of natural gas, primarily to avoid waste and to determine investment
requirements. The second operation consisted of a credit line of US$100.0 (Loan
2031-AR) through the Government's Development Bank, for financing local private
sector investments in the petroleum industry. The loan subject of this report
was followed by a Gas Utilization Technical Assistance Loan (Loan 2592-AR).
Overall implementation of the above projects was successful, despite the
country's economic difficulties and institutional deficiencies in the sector.
Project Objectives and Description
5.       The project was designed to support the overall energy sector investment
program, heavily based on the development of natural gas resources, while
providing means for significant savings of foreign exchange. As substitution of
natural gas for fuel oil would take place in the power, industrial and
residential sectors, the Project would convert Argentina's substantial surplus
low-value residual fuel oil to higher-value refinery products, which were in
short supply.  The Project would also improve the performance of YPF's major
refineries, strengthen the company's financial management system, train YPF
operational staff, and study the potential for energy saving in the industrial
sector.
6.       The Project included five components:
a.      Refinery Conversion Scheme.   The scheme aimed primarily at
converting surplus low value fuel-oil, a heavy petroleum product, from two
refineries --one at La Plata, near Buenos Aires, and the other at Lujan Cuyo,
1,000 km from Buenos Aires--into higher-value light and middle distillates (e.g.
gasoline, gas oil, diesel oil, etc.) to redress the imbalance in the product
slate of these two major refineries. These two facilities together account for
79% of YPF's total refinery capacity of its six refineries, and 51% of
Argentine's total refining capacity. Individually, the La Plata and Lujan del
Cuyo refineries were capable of processing 220,150 bpd and 128,950 bpd of crude
oil, respectively. Although both refineries had secondary processing facilities
in the form of coking and fluid catalytic-cracking units, the respective
capacities were relatively small and a large proportion of reduced crude was
being directly blended into the fuel oil pool. The Refinery Conversion Scheme
was designed to process almost all of the reduced crude oil at each location by
converting it into feedstocks for subsequent additional conversion into light or
middle distillates, as well as coke. The proposed production increase was, from
a total of about 4.2 million tons (28 million barrels) of fuel oil from La Plata



-3-
and Lujan de Cuyo refineries, to about 3.9 million tons (26 million barrels) of
higher-value lighter distillates and coke.
b.      Plant Operations Improvement Program (POIP):   The component
would implement an operations improvement program based upon the recommendations
previously made by a French consultancy firm. The emphasis would be on energy
saving and pollution control aspects at the La Plata and Lujan de Cuyo
refineries. It included projects under five subcomponents:
(i) pollution control improvements: (i) in the air floatation unit, by
reducing hydrocarbons and solid content in liquid effluent; (ii) in the
coke handling operations, by procuring 25 wagons to transport the
product to a calcination unit to be placed about seven kilometers away
from the process unit; and (iii) treatment of industrial waste water
at La Plata refinery;
(ii) energy conservation project aimed at reducing fuel consumption in
the process furnaces at both refineries;
(iii) production and process improvements by replacing one of the coke
unit compressors at La Plata refinery;
(iv) modernization of refinery instrumentation by installing in-line
process analyzers at La Plata refinery; and
(v) process unit optimization with the help of mathematical models that
would determine optimum operating conditions for any desired product
specifications.
C.      Financial Management Improvement Program (FMIP) for YPF.  The
program would concentrate on the establishment of a system of cost centers, the
introduction of systems for cost-control, management information, capital
budgeting and financial planning, which were to be based upon a study to be
carried out by an American consultancy firm.
d.      Training Program. The program would concentrate on training YPF
personnel in modern financial management systems, energy savings, pollution
control techniques, and better operating and maintenance practices with
particular emphasis on the needs of its refinery divisions.
e.      Industrial Energy Audit.   This component was designed for
monitoring energy consumption of the Argentine industry in general, with the
purpose of recommending the necessary measures to improve efficiency in the use
of energy by the major industrial enterprises of Argentina, and to determine the
scope for energy saving in those entities, along with an estimate of investment
requirements. The audit would concentrate on the following areas:
(i)     review the pattern of energy consumption and the scope for
substitution;



(ii)    examine the scope for the reduction in energy waste through
retrofitting; and
(iii)   review the potential for developing retrofitting equipment
production in the country.
7.       This last component,(e), would be carried out with the assistance of
consultants under the auspices of the Secretariat of Fuels of the Ministry of
Works and Public Service, while the rest of the components would be carried out
by YPF with the help of capable and experienced engineering firms for project
design, engineering, procurement, and implementation.
Project Design, Organization and Implementation
8.       In the late 1970's Argentina was faced with the paradox of exporting
important volumes of surplus fuel oil while importing middle distillates to make
up the shortages and meet the increasing transportation, industrial, and
household needs for those products.   The fuel oil surplus was expected to
increase as Argentina replaced the use of petroleum products with natural gas for
industrial and household uses, thus reducing the quantity of natural gas being
flared. The Government of Argentina and YPF approached the Bank in early 1980
to finance the Project.   An identification mission from the Bank visited
Argentina in March of that year followed by a pre-appraisal mission in June. The
project was created as an integral part of the effort by the Government to reduce
Argentina's dependence on imported petroleum products as a primary energy source.
It would enable the conversion of the surplus fuel oil into higher value lighter
and middle petroleum distillates, which otherwise would be imported, and would
also better utilize the country's abundant natural gas resources, hence
correcting the existing imbalance between the demand and the supply of petroleum
products in Argentina.
9.       Execution of this project took place during a period of great domestic
and external difficulties for Argentina, such as an international armed conflict
and serious economic instability.  In 1982, Argentina had a serious military
confrontation with the UK over the South Atlantic Falkland islands, which
resulted in a serious drain of the country's financial resources and in
international tension. In 1984, the Government launched a stabilization program
to reduce excessive inflation and cut down the fiscal deficit. A new currency,
the Austral, was created, and all Government support to public enterprises was
eliminated. These decision affected YPF's financial position (see para. 30),
which was worsened even further by internal inefficiencies in operation, which
in turn, caused high financial costs and high prices that had to be paid by YPF
to private suppliers and contractors to compensate for YPF's delays in payments,
and therefore, inflated YPF's expenditures by US$400-500 million annually.
10.      In early 1986, prompted by its precarious financial situation YPF
requested from the Bank a supplementary loan of USS116 million, to help finance
a portion of the foreign exchange cost of the conversion works and to help YPF
strengthen its financial and other management controls. This supplementary loan
was rapidly appraised and found financially and economically viable.   The
supplementary loan was approved on May 20,1986, pursuing the collateral



requirements of: (i) strengthening YPF's financial management and reestablishing
creditworthiness;  (ii)  focussing  its  investment  program  on more  balanced
objectives, including the production of exportable crude oil and/or refined
products; and (iii) expanding the role of the private sector in exploration and
production.
11.      Overall implementation of the project got off to a late start primarily
because of the military confrontation in the South Atlantic. It also took longer
than expected to complete the basic engineering for the conversion activities.
Subsequently, as a result of the efforts of YPF's project unit, aided by two
international consortia, execution of the project proceeded satisfactorily.
12.      The Refinery Conversion Scheme.  The component suffered serious delays
for the following reasons: (i) delays in contracting of the engineering
contractor, responsible for detailed engineering, procurement services, and all
construction; (ii) delays on account of much longer than anticipated procedural
time required for import of components of raw materials by domestic equipment
fabricators, coupled with initial delays in providing complete process
engineering documentation packages to the general engineering contractors; (iii)
a longer than estimated engineering contractors' commitment for completing the
works.
13.      The Refinery   Conversion Scheme for La Plata and Lujan del Cuyo
refineries was managed in each case by a General Engineering Contractor. For the
selection of these consultants YPF invited internationally-known contracting
companies. Pre-qualification information was presented by eight international
firms in association with local Argentine companies of their choice.  Of the
eight consortia, five were pre-qualified in accordance with selection criteria
established mutually between YPF and the Bank, namely technical, economical and
financial qualifications, guaranteed project completion, timing and contract
price. Separate bids for La Plata and for Lujan del Cuyo refineries were invited
to be presented on October 18, 1981.
14.      The best qualified bids were selected for each refinery.  For La Plata
refinery, a Japanese-Argentine consortium was selected, with a bid price
equivalent to US$99.73 million, including an estimated foreign exchange component
of US$21.70 million.   For the Lujan de Cuyo refinery, an American-Argentine
consortium was selected, with a bid price of US$87.96 million, including an
estimated foreign exchange component of US$20.25 million.
15.      The main conversion works at both refineries, Lujan de Cuyo and La
Plata, were completed on April 18, 1988 and December 13, 1989, respectively. At
the Lujan del Cuyo refinery the new main processing units were placed in
operation sequentially from mid-December 1987 through mid-April 1988.  At La
Plata, progress in project implementation was much slower, requiring twice re-
prioritization and re-allocation of construction resources to allow completion
of critical activities by mid-1988 and the whole component by end-1989.
16.      As part of this component, YPF had agreed to construct a crude oil
supply pipeline to the Lujan de Cuyo refinery and to increase the capacity of the
product pipeline from the refineries to the Greater Buenos Aires area. Lack of
foreign exchange prevented YPF to do this work. Subsequently, at YPF's request,



- 6 -
the Bank agreed to finance the two pipelines under the Gas Utilization Project
(Loan 2592-AR).
17.      Plant Operations Improvement Program (POIP).  Execution of the various
subcomponents, under this part of the Loan, was considerably delayed, although
all works had been contracted by the third quarter of 1988.   Three of the main
subcomponents were completed by mid-1989, and the remainder minor sub-projects
were completed by end-1989, with the exception of a few sub-components consisting
of support equipment for the main old refinery installations, where most of the
financing under this component was to be provided directly by YPF. The reason
for these delays was the poor economic situation prevailing in Argentina, which
did not allow the Government to provide YPF with the necessary counterpart funds
to finance execution of these projects.
18.      The sub-components completed under this category included installation:
(I) at the Lujan de Cuyo refinery of air heaters for the crude-oil, vacuum and
coke furnaces, two Isomax compressors, as well as naphtha blending facilities;
(II) at La Plata refinery, installation of heat recovery boiler for the catalytic
cracking unit, air pre-heater for the furnaces, naphtha blending facilities, and
on-line process analyzers, additionally, at La Plata refinery the electrical
system was remodelled, and the vacuum lube furnace was modified.
19.      Financial Management Improvement Program (FMIP) for YPF.  An American
consulting firm performed a study of YPF's financial and accounting practices.
Based on the recommendations made by the consultant in both refineries, cost
centers were established and cost control systems were implemented at Lujan Cuyo
Refinery. The YPF team that worked along with the consultancy firm in performing
this studies was able to introduce the systems at Plaza Huincul Refinery located
in the Province of Neuquen.
20.      Industrial Energy Audit.  Initiation of this component suffered major
delays mainly caused by problems in the bidding process for the selection of the
consultancy firm, and in the award of the contract for the US$2.0 million Energy
Gonservation Study, as well as by changes in the scope of the study and in the
TOR's when the new Government came in to office. However, even after procurement
matters were clarified and contract award decisions had been made, the Borrower
requested not to proceed with the component at that time because the Government
failed to give  it sufficient priority.   Therefore,  the  Industrial  Energy
Conservation, Pollution Control and Industrial Energy Audit studies were canceled
from the loan. Instead, the Bank agreed to the Borrower's request for the funds
to be reallocated to items of higher priority, such as equipment, spare parts,
and erection and construction works.
21.      Taking into account all the difficulties encountered during project
execution, the Bank agreed to a one year extension of the revised Closing Date
of the project, to December 31, 1988. However, additional difficulties led to
an additional extension to December 31, 1989. Physical execution of the project
was completed in October 1990.

Proiect Results
22.      Overall, the objectives of the project were essentially accomplished.
Completion of the Refinery Conversion Scheme resulted in security of supply of
light and middle petroleum products without altering the already established
consumption pattern of heavy fuel-oil, and without using additional reserves to
satisfy demand.   Due to the natural gas substitution and industrial energy
conservation efforts, fuel-oil demand has continuously declined while consumption
of light and middle distillates has continued to grow.
23.      The commissioning of the conversion units  in both refineries has
resulted in a 23 percent reduction in the production of fuel-oil, a 10 percent
increase in the production of naphtha, and a 17 percent production increase in
intermediate distillates. These improvements translate into a reduction of 4
million tons of fuel oil and an increase of 3 million cubic meters in the
production of light and intermediate distillates.   Additionally,  given the
variety in the materials to be processed, such as crude oil of high sulphur and
metallic content, the new conversion units gave rise to the opportunity to
increase crude oil production in the Mendoza fields.
24.      The total cost of the project reached US$919 million, or 13 percent
above the revised estimate, of which US$316 million,--34 percent of the total
cost of the project-- was financed by the Bank.
Bank Performance
25.      The  Bank made  a  significant  contribution  during  preparation  and
identification of the project, particularly at the design stage, with the
selection of the most appropriate conversion scheme vis-a-vis the inputs to be
used in the process, and with the determination of the optimum production levels.
During implementation, the Bank played a key role in ensuring and improving
execution, since it followed-up closely the construction and procurement
schedules of implementation, and monitored disbursements and the co-financing
scheme.  Supervision was sufficient and effective, resulting in provision of
timely advice on corrective measures, in all aspects of project execution.
26.      An excellent relationship between the Bank and YPF was built from the
start.   This association still contributed to progress even during times of
difficulties and to solve problems more rapidly during the whole operation. At
the same time, YPF's personnel benefitted from the technical, managerial and
economic expertise of Bank staff. In addition, the Bank was pivotal in helping
YPF to keep the project on course when its financing collapsed and to complete
it  two  years  later  than  envisaged,  a considerable  feat  under Argentina
instability during this period. When the loan was approved, foreign commercial
sources were scheduled to provide nearly half of the estimated US$880 million
total project costs, and almost all of its US$439 million foreign costs.  By
comparison, the Bank envisaged contribution was relatively small, i.e., limited
to financing a part of local costs and less than a fourth of total expenses.
However, when the other external financing fell through, the bank constructively
stepped in with the supplementary loan and mobilized the complementary Export-
Import Bank of Japan cofinancing. YPF had agreed to increase substantially its



- 8-
own contribution as well (the final figures show the rise from US$257 million to
some US$411 million). But the bank judged, in all likelihood correctly, that
Argentina could not mobilize the alternative hard currency and generate
internally all of the additional funds needed.
Borrower Performance
27.      The  1980's  was  a  difficult  decade  for  YPF,  within  the  overall
problematic situation of the country. Production and sales volumes suffered from
low  investment budgets  for petroleum  exploration and development.    YPF's
financial viability was also affected by insufficient prices for its products and
a variety of taxes and other transfers to the rest of the economy.  However,
following the low crude oil production obtained in 1987, which jeopardized the
country's self sufficiency, and created a need for oil imports, YPF and the
Government initiated a set of measures to improve YPF's operations and earnings
situation.
28.      The problems which affected the conduct of the project could not be
anticipated by the Borrower or the Bank during project design. The executing
agency, YPF, dealt effectively with overcoming the initial delays, exercised
careful cost controls, and acted to reschedule the works appropriately to prevent
further delays in project completion.
29.      The Government showed commitment to implement reforms in the sector by
streamlining the public investment in the sector, relying more on private capital
for exploration and development, and making equity contributions to YPF, which
were aimed at eliminating the external debt obligations of YPF and its internal
debt arrears.
Financial Performance
30.      The main difficulty faced by this project was the financial situation
of YPF. At the time of appraisal, YPF planned to finance a large part of the
engineering and equipment costs with both foreign and domestic borrowing, and use
a substantial portion of the Bank loan for local construction awarded under ICB.
With the curtailment of the Government's and YPF's capacity for foreign
borrowing, due to the country's economic crisis, YPF decided to use the Bank loan
to finance only foreign equipment, materials and spares, and to utilize all
available local funds to finance local equipment and construction. In view of
this, YPF requested a reallocation of Bank loan proceeds with a 61% dedication,
instead of 28% initially assigned, that would go to equipment and spares
purchases. This reallocation was approved by the Bank and the loan was amended
in late 1985.
31.      Due to YPF's increasing difficulties in mobilizing the anticipated
commercial bank support, coupled with a tight cash-flow situation and sustained
losses during the first half of the 1980s, the project had an unfilled financial
gap of almost half of total project requirements.   The Bank approved the YPF
request for supplemental financing for an amount of US$116 million to complete
the foreign exchange requirement and allowed for additional financing, through
a Co-Lender's Agreement, for US$186 with the Eximbank of Japan, which was also
obtained.



32.      YPF failed to meet the financial targets  covenanted  in the Loan
Agreement, as did the Government on its pricing undertakings. During the project
execution period in fact, the company suffered a massive financial deterioration.
Its indebtedness increased excessively and the company ran substantial operating
deficits. Part of this stemmed from the Government's aforementioned failure to
maintain adequate ex-refinery prices of YPF's products. Another factor was that,
although excise taxes and consumer prices were quite high, the Government
deprived YPF of substantial earnings.
33.      These weaknesses were already apparent when the Bank agreed to proceed
with the supplementary financing in 1986. Subsequently moreover, the revised
financial covenants and related undertakings of the second loan were also not
complied with, and YPF's financial performance remained deficient. On the face
of it therefore, the Bank would appear to have erred in judging that the
additional financing ... "while initially serving to resolve YPF's immediate
financial problems, ...would also support the Government's efforts to restore
YPF's financial self-sufficiency..."  (Memorandum to the Board R86-110, May 1,
1986, para.  17).   In fact, however, with the passage of time, the Bank's
confidence was substantiated. Drawing on Bank sector work and the close personal
relationships developed under the Project, YPF and the Government in recent years
relied on the Bank for assistance on sweeping sector reforms, as well as
privatizing and restructuring the company. These have yielded sound financial
and other benefits."
34.      At appraisal, the financial analysis was only performed on the Refinery
Conversion Component. It was shown then that the financial performance of the
project was more sensitive to the demand, and/or refinery capacity utilization,
than to international oil prices.
Economic Performance
35.      At appraisal it was shown that, unlike the results of the financial
evaluation, the economic performance of the project was more sensitive to the
structure of petroleum product prices than to the demand or refinery capacity
utilization. This was primarily because increased domestic demand was valued at
lower retention prices as compared to any exportable surpluses, which were valued
at relatively higher international prices. International prices of petroleum
products were less favorable to YPF than anticipated, which resulted in an ERR
of 11.99 percent, much lower than the 24.6 percent envisaged at appraisal.
Assumptions, data, and calculations for the ex-post economic evaluation can be
found in the addendum to the Completion Report prepared by the Borrower,
available in the Region files.
Consulting Services
36.      The  general  performance  of  all  consultants  and  contractors  was
satisfactory. The main consultants always showed extensive cooperation during
all project phases--engineering, construction, start-up-- and commissioning. The
most important aspect of the main consultant's participation was the considerable
involvement it had with YPF's personnel, effectively transferring technological
know-how.



- 10 -
37.      The other contractors also performed well from the technical point of
view. However, delays in procurement of materials and completion of works were
frequent, explained by the abrupt changing economic conditions in the country
during that period.
Lessons to be Learned
38.      Due to the sensitivity of project economic performance to the evolution
of crude oil and refined products to domestic and international prices, the
sector should develop or improve institutional and marketing capabilities to
respond quickly, and flexibly to market conditions, including allowing the
private refineries to export products directly, taking advantage of their export
marketing channels, to develop export markets in contiguous countries to take
advantage of the relative lower freights, and to develop abilities to adjust
quickly refineries' operating conditions.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1.       The Borrower complied with Part II of the Project Completion Guidelines,
by preparing a Project Completion Report sent under Note B-54 No. 1284 of October
12, 1990, and that will be forwarded to LAC Files for reference.
2.       Although the loan was closed two years later than planned all the
project components were executed, thus allowing the following:
(a) Assurance that the supply of the local market in light and medium
products can be achieved by the conversion of heavy cuts without having
to increase the influx of crude oil to the refinery. In that way an
increased production and a consequent decrease of hydrocarbon reserves
will not be necessary to satisfy demand.
(b) Raise the refining processes of YPF's refineries to international
standards except for environmental and products quality.   In that
respect the local market demand can be satisfied for the next 10 years
and the environment and products quality can be raised to international
standards (mainly high octane gasoline) by investing not more than 100
million dollars.
(c) Possibility to generate excess light products for export.
(d)   Inclusion of new management  tcchniques  as a result of the
installation of the latest techniques for systems control.
(e)   On the macroeconomic aspect an investment of that magnitude
contributes to the increase of the gross national product of the
country with a direct impact on the areas where the projects are
implemented.
3.       The previous comments where extracted from the conclusions of the
borrower's report.
