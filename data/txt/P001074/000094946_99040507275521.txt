A. PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES
1.   Project objectives and key performance indicators
1.1  The project aims to (a) improve the living conditions of Conakry's urban population through the
provision of basic priority services; and (b) create an enabling environment for sustained programming,
financing and management of priority investments and services in major urban centers of the country. In
addition, the project aims to reinforce the capacities of municipalities by targeting specific municipal
services and by introducing new tools to improve selection and implementation of infrastructure and basic
services benefiting as many people as possible.
1.2  To reach its development objectives, the program aims to implement, over a period of 6 years, a
program consisting of two phases:
* The first phase would include three components: (a) priority infrastructure and services in Conakry;
(b) assistance to secondary cities; and (c) institutional strengthening. See Section C and Annex 2 for
descriptions of these components.
* The second phase would include: (a) construction of a new Kagbelen landfill; (b) implementation of
the second phase of the neighborhood upgrading program; (c) execution of works for the T7 and voie
express thoroughfares; (d) continuation of the priority investment program (PIP) and Municipal
Adjustment Program (MAP) identified in the municipal audits; and (e) continuation of support for
improved financing of priority services.
1.3  Phase 1 would take place over a three-year period, at the end of which Phase 2 could start provided
that performnance indicators are satisfactory and trigger conditions fulfilled. These indicators are defined
in Annex 3.

B. STRATEGIC CONTEXT
1.   COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY (CAS)
CAS document number: 17183       Date of latest CAS discussion: December 16, 1997
1.1  As indicated in the CAS reviewed by the Board on November 21, 1997, the proposed Third Urban
Development Project will capitalize on lessons learned from the Second Urban Project (UDP2) and
pursue the overall objective of poverty reduction and improvement of the living conditions of the urban
population while strengthening local urban institutions and managerial capacities. The CAS highlighted
improvement of service delivery, access to basic public services, and effective human resource
development as essential to poverty reduction. The project fits into this strategy.

2.   MAIN SECTOR ISSUES AND GOVERNMENT STRATEGY
2.1    Rapid growth and impoverishment of cities. The urban population has grown from 450,000
inhabitants (14 percent of the total population) in 1960 to 2.3 million (36 percent of the total population)
in 1995. Due to the rapidity of this urbanization and the lack of attention paid to urban infrastructure and
services, living conditions are particularly difficult for urban dwellers. The population of the City of
Conakry, estimated in 1997 at 1.1 million inhabitants, is growing at a rate of over 4 percent per year, due
to a steady and heavy flow of rural migrants. These new urban poor find it increasingly difficult to find
housing in old densely populated neighborhoods, and settle where rents are lower, i.e., in the least well-
equipped and least accessible neighborhoods. These population concentrations are developing within the
existing agglomeration, in areas isolated by their topography, alongside railroad lines and the berms of
elevated roads, as well as along the extended frontage of the city, which is lengthening rapidly due to the
linear configuration of Conakry's site. The lack of feeder roads, off the primary network, to serve the
poorer outskirts cuts them off from the rest of the city, and the inaccessibility of many neighborhoods is
an important contributor to the economic and social imbalance observed in patterns of urban occupation.
The secondary cities, which had a population of about 1.4 million in 1997, are struggling with similar
situations, as well as a scarcity of equipment and public services, with far fewer resources than those of
Conakry. Unlike Conakry and the regional urban centers, several of these cities are also without any
documented master plan for spatial and economic development. This situation does little to help their
authorities take coherent and effective measures to develop public services that can improve the
population's living conditions.
2.2   Inadequacy of priority urban services. The problem is illustrated by two significant examples:
solid waste management and secondary roads maintenance. In 1987, the City of Conakry created a
specific unit in charge of solid waste management and drainage maintenance (UPSU). The unit became
fully operational in 1988. The first and second Bank-supported urban projects provided UPSU with 39
trucks and part of their operating costs on a declining basis until 1994. The financial resources provided
to UPSU by the city represents only 40 percent of UPSU's budget and only 25 percent of the required
financing, including depreciation. The number of working trucks decreased to 18 in 1993 and to 12 in
1997. The rapid deterioration of equipment is a result of inadequate financial resources allocated to
maintenance costs. Solid waste collection rates decreased from 50 percent in 1989 to less than 20 percent
in 1996. The deteriorating situation led the Government to replace UPSU and its 353 employees in April
1997 with a new autonomous public entity (SPTD) in charge of waste collection and staffed with 80
employees..
Of the ±200 km of secondary roads in Conakry's secondary roads network (inter-neighborhood streets
and roads connecting neighborhoods to the primary network), nearly 80 percent are either unused or
underused. Only 58 km are paved, and half of these are in poor condition and difficult to negotiate. The
remaining stretches are earthen, of which two-thirds have never been improved. The under-use of this
network results in excessive traffic on and rapid deterioration of the improved portions, traffic overflows
onto the primary roads, longer trips, and needless overcrowding of primary roads. Work on the secondary
roads, mostly donor-financed, are usually focussed on refurbishing, and sometimes extending, the
improved portions of the network. With the exception of some limited operations undertaken under
UDP2, the dirt roads receive no routine or periodic maintenance. These (small) works are crucial for the
level of service and useful life of roadways and drains, and their absence is one of the main causes of the
uneven use of the primary and secondary thoroughfares. The lack of attention paid to routine and
periodic road and drain maintenance, especially where dirt roads are concerned, is due to the following:
(a) the scarcity of local resources (the normal annual expenditure for this category of work in Conakry
should be over 1 billion GNF - half of which should be spent on the dirt roads, or over one-third of the
current overall budget of the Governorate and the 5 districts (communes)); (b) the unclear definition of
responsibilities between the state, the city and the communes; (c) a faulty perception of maintenance work

on the part of decision makers, who favor rehabilitation of existing paved roads over the preservation of a
level of service corresponding to the needs/wants of the greatest number of people; and (d) a lack of
expertise and willingness on the part of technicians in the area of recurrent works, which are more
difficult to plan and monitor, as well as less prestigious, than new works or heavy rehabilitation. All
these factors result in a de facto neglect of the most under equipped neighborhoods, which are generally
the poorest, and therefore in greater disparities within the city. They also tend to limit the public work
orders available to small local contractors.
2.3    Scarcity and precariousness of Conakry's financial resources. The financial resources of the
agglomeration (City and communes) amount to slightly under 3 billion GNF per year, which translates to
0.8 percent of the Government budget and an allotment of 2,500 GNF per inhabitant per year
($2.20/inhabitant). These resources are particularly inadequate to cover the costs of priority services
transferred to the City (solid waste and road maintenance), which are estimated to be at least 70 percent of
the City's own resources. In 1997, the City took the exceptional step of devoting 50 percent of its current
receipts (900 million GNF) to solid waste management: 2/3 to SPTD for operating expenses and 1/3 to
finance street cleaning. The City's financial contribution to secondary road maintenance remains
marginal (under 50 million GNF per year). The communes do not directly contribute to the financing of
these services. This level of financing of priority services is due to a considerable increase in Conakry's
resources since the city acquired its special status in 1991. The trend has been more erratic for the past
two years'. This less favorable trend is not only due to the economic impact of the events of 1996, but
also to the creation of the TPU and the CFU (1996-98) and the new fiscal sharing arrangements between
the state, the communes and the City: 40 percent of the TPU and 60 percent of the CFU go to the state,
with the rest shared between the City and its districts. This arrangement is unfavorable to the City, unless
it is accompanied by a significant increase in collection rates, and impacts the City's budget since the
budget derives 70% of its resources from taxes (business tax and TPU (45%)), property tax (20%), and
TWN (5%). The central government accounts for only 10% (capital endowment) of the City's budget; the
rest (20%) is generated by land registry fees and the sale of plots.
2.4    Weak planning and implementation capacity. Despite progress made during the Second
Urban Project, human resources are still insufficient at the local level. Capacity for planning urban
services and delegating service provision is inadequate. Most urban investments are driven by the
availability of donors funds and not by local priorities.
2.5   Cumbersome procurement procedures. Delays in awarding contracts and in starting works are
another important cause of the limited investment capacity at the national and local levels. These delays
occur at three stages: (a) processing bids and signing contracts took an average of 8 months under the
Second Urban Project; (b) obtaining security deposits and bid bonds took anywhere from 2 to 10 months
after contract signing, because of the commercial banks' reluctance to deal with SMEs; and (c) obtaining
tax exemptions required at least 9 months after contract signing, and the length of the delays was
correlated to the size of contract awardees, i.e., the smaller the business, the longer the delay.
-  11991: 1,443 million GNF (City's portion: 693 nillion GNF)
- 1992: 1,641 million GNF (City's portion: 821 million GNF). Trend = + 13 %
- 1993 : 1,851 million GNF (City's portion: 1,163 million GNF). Trend = + 12.5%
- 1994: 2,417 million GNF (City's portion: 1,430 million GNF). Trend = +30%
- 1995 : 2,599 million GNF (City's portion: 1,812 million GNF). Trend = +7.5%
- 1996: 2,248 million GNF (City's portion: 1,298 million GNF). Trend = -14%
-  1997: 2,906 million GNF (City's portion: 2,143 million GNF). Trend = +18%.

2.6    Hesitant implementation of the decentralization process. The decentralization process,
officially begun in 1985, is proceeding slowly. Thirty-eight municipalities (of which 5 are in Conakry)
were established in 1991, and none have been created since. The development of institutional mechanisms
at the central level does not seem to be moving any faster. In particular, arrangements for sharing
technical expertise and resources between the local and central governments remain vague in most areas,
for lack of a specific regulatory framework. The Governor of Conakry serves simultaneously as the
representative of the Central Government responsible for the management and coordination of the
deconcentrated state services, and as the president of the executive authority constituted by an elected city
council. The most recent arrangements concerning local taxation (TPU and CFU) make the central
government the beneficiary of tax receipts that have traditionally been local, and perpetuate a complicated
apportionment of resources between the districts and the Governorate of Conakry.
3.   SECTOR ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE PROJECT AND STRATEGIC OPTIONS
3.1  The project aims to bring about lasting improvements within the City of Conakry in the following
areas: (a) environmental health, by strengthening garbage collection and disposal services and by
arranging for sustainable financing of these services by beneficiaries and the Governorate; (b)
accessibility of under-served neighborhoods, by rehabilitating and opening up their access roads and
building primary roads serving the poorer outskirts; (c) level of service of the road network, by putting in
place mechanisms for the regular planning and budgeting of routine and periodic maintenance, in order to
increase the capacity of the secondary network and reduce traffic loads on primary roads; (d) revenue and
managerial capacity of the Govemorate's financial services, with a view to the sustainability of the
aforementioned services; and (e) secondary cities, improved planning, programming and financing of
priority services and infrastructure maintenance.
C. SUMMARY PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.   PROJECT COMPONENTS
Component 1.   Improvements to Priority Infrastructure and Services in Conakry
* Solid waste management. This sub-component has the following objectives: (a) increase the level of
garbage collection; (b) limit the environmental impact of waste production by operating, in an
ecological way, the existing La Miniere landfill and setting up the Kagbelen landfill facility; (c)
develop the technical and managerial capacities of small contractors in the private sector and
increase the operational capacity of the SPTD; and (d) begin a pilot program for the composting of
household garbage. The solid waste management component includes the works required to
develop the infrastructure needed for garbage collection, including the construction of 30 solid
waste grouping points and the provision of about 2 km of access roads to the sites in the Ratoma
and Matoto neighborhoods. This component also includes the provision of 3 large-capacity
transport trucks, 15 storage containers of 24 m3 each, 1 bulldozer, and I compactor for the La
Miniere landfill. The project will finance a program of support, training, information and
communication, and institutional strengthening of small and medium contractors and of the SPTD.
The project will provide for the environmental monitoring of the La Miniere landfill and will
support a pilot compost production and marketing operation. This first phase will provide for the
preparation of the technical and environmental studies needed to construct the new landfill site at
Kagbelen, which would be financed under the program's second phase. The Kagbelen landfill,



5
located 47 km from the city center, will replace the one at La Miniere, which is expected to reach
the end of its useful life within the next five years.
Cost: US$ 3.6 million
Neighborhood Upgrading (Desenclavement de quartiers). This sub-component will include a
series of rehabilitation and maintenance operations on Conakry's secondary roads. Works will fall
into three categories: (a) rehabilitation aimed at restoring existing assets to service (repairs to drains
and deteriorated roads, including filling, patching, shoulder repair, etc.); (b) a minimal number of
new construction works to put important, but currently unusable, roads into service (road cutting,
including surfacing, profiling, infill, etc.); and (c) maintenance works aimed at maintaining the
serviceability of rehabilitated assets (routine or periodic maintenance: resurfacing, patching, re-
contouring). These works will be carried out in the context of two different programs: (a) small-
scale district-level initiative programs (PLIC), consisting of small routine maintenance works
involving little or no mechanization, identified by the districts (communes) and implemented by
small or very small contractors under simplified procedures; (b) priority rehabilitation and road
opening programs (PROP), consisting of heavier and more mechanized works to be entrusted to
larger contractors in accordance with the usual procedures. Works eligible for the PLIC will
include: waste removal and deep patching, flushing ditches, gutters or overflow outlets, cutting or
profiling ditches in light or rocky soils, filling potholes, constructing earthen verges or sidewalks,
manual profiling of rocky roadways, constructing or repairing gutters, overflow outlets and gullies,
and constructing or repairing culverts. Works eligible for the PROP will include: regrading
roadways (using a grader), infilling and compacting dirt roads (grader and compactor), grading new
roadways (grader or bulldozer), constructing or repairing drains (concrete-mixer), replacing or
repairing curbs (concrete-mixer), resurfacing paved roads (grader, compactor, water tanker truck,
finisher), re-edging paved roads (compactor, finisher), paving sidewalks and roadways. The PLIC
and PROP will be scheduled on an annual and communal basis. The proper implementation of a
given year's PLIC, totally financed by local resources, will constitute the partial counterpart
contribution of the Governorate and the communes, in exchange for which the next year's PROP
will be 90 percent financed by IDA. During the first year, the commencement of the PROP will
only be subject to the condition that the Govemorate and the communes fulfill their counterpart
contributions.
Cost: US$ 5.2 million.
* Primary road network. The objective of this sub-component is to stimulate economic activity in the
capital, which is sporadically paralyzed by traffic jams due to the fact that its site does not easily
lend itself to urban development. The roads to be built, the "voie express" and the T7, are intended
to: (a) improve vehicular traffic at critical blockage points, especially on the stretches leading out of
Conakry and linking the capital to the country's interior; and (b) improve access to the new landfill
at Kagbelen, which will begin under the Project. The planned improvements are part of the City
Master Plan prepared under the First Urban Project and partially carried out over the past few years
by IDA (under the Second Urban Project), the BND (Budget National de Developpement) and
various other donors. The significant impact of these completed major road works on the capital's
traffic inspired the Government to include a new primary road package in the Third Urban
Development Project. Studies, including lateral and cross-sectional alignments were performed in
1988 (by SGI under the Second Urban Project -- voie express to preliminary tender documents level
and T7 to detailed studies level), and are to be completed under Phase 1 of the Project. The Second
Urban Project funded, in 1998, training in the use of road design software for DATU personnel, as
well as associated materials. Phase 1 will be limited to economic and implementation studies and
preparatory works: staking out rights-of-way; displacement, as needed, of utility networks; and



6
construction of temporary vehicle tracks to facilitate access for local residents and the surveillance
of rights-of-way. These works are intended: (a) to protect the rights-of-way; (b) to clearly indicate
the outlines of the right-of-way in order to avoid illegal occupation; and (c) to improve the road
segments that serve residents of roadside areas. Economic and topographic studies and bidding
documents will be prepared under the supervision of DATU's Direction de la Voirie urbaine, in
coordination with the Ministry of Equipment's DNIR. As of today, there is no occupation of the
site.
Cost: US$ 2.3 million.
Component 2.   Assistance to secondary cities.
The objectives are: (a) to support the ongoing decentralization process by helping mayors to better plan
for the needs of their communes and to carry out a Priority Investment Program (PIP) based on popular
consultation; (b) to take this opportunity to refine the approaches developed by DATU for implementing
the Regional Master Plan (SNAT); and (c) to boost national expertise by involving the public and private
sectors.
The component will deal with 10 cities and will include two sub-components: preparation of urban and
municipal audits for each city, and implementation of the works defined in these audits.
•  The "audits" will help define the Priority Investment Programs (PIPs) and Municipal Adjustment
Programs (MAPs), which local authorities and populations will help to prepare. The results will be
officially set out in a "Municipal Contract" signed by the Prefect and the Mayor, stating their
commitment to the choice and implementation of investments and measures aimed at improving
municipal management. The PIPs and MAPs will be carried out after the signing of the "Municipal
Contract." The "municipal audit" will identify: (a) the commune's financial capacities and, therefore,
the cost of the investments to which the commune can aspire under the Third Urban Development
Project; and (b) the adjustment measures the Commune will agree to make, especially to improve its
management. Five percent of the PIP will be financed by the municipality. The "urban audit" will
propose, upon completion of a diagnostic analysis of the city, a coherent set of priority projects, the
cost of which will correspond to the budget determined by the "municipal audit."
•  Works will involve priority asset and infrastructure projects under municipal responsibility and
provide the population with better access. A part of the works will be undertaken in Phase 1.
The audits will be prepared in collaboration with DATU, local authorities and the population. They will
be performed by teams of consultants and DATU's professional staff (who will receive prior training in
this area), and piloted by the Urban Programming Unit (CPU). The CPU will be responsible for training,
promoting the component through the media, and preparing/monitoring audits. The CPU will help the
municipality to structure its consultations with the population, and finalize the PIP and MAP, and will
provide assistance with signing the municipal contract. Works under the PIP will be performed on a
contract basis. The CPU will be responsible for preparing detailed designs, procurement, and for
overseeing and taking delivery of works. By the end of Phase 1, at least eight cities will have prepared
their PIPs and MAPs, and at least six of those will have signed municipal contracts.
Cost: US$ 3.7 million.
Component 3.   Institutional strengthening
.  Support to operational units.   Five operational units - Local Finance, Secondary Roads
Maintenance, Urban Planning (formerly the Adressage Unit), Urban Roads, and SPTD - created



7
under the Second Urban Project will play a key role in implementing the Third Urban Development
Project. By providing these units with the logistical, financial and human resources they need to
carry out their mandates, the Third Urban Development Project will help strengthen the technical
capacities of their oversight agencies (Gouvernorat, DATU, DNI). The five operational units'
operations will be supported and monitored, and more targeted assistance will be provided based on
their specific activities.  Support for operations will include financing expenditures, with the
exception of salaries, required to maintain the continuity of the units' activities (consumables,
miscellaneous supplies, fuel, vehicle maintenance, etc.).  This support will help avoid the
interruptions observed under the Second Urban Project. Periodic technical assistance will help
monitor the units' work, guide their activities and identify their needs. Targeted training will also be
provided.
Cost: US$ 1.4 million.
Support to improved financing of priority services. Financing of solid waste management and
secondary road maintenance is of paramount importance for improved urban management in
Conakry. In order to bring about lasting improvements in financing mechanisms for these services,
the Project will help to (a) clarify the financing system of the City, which is the main entity
responsible for proper implementation of the aforementioned priority urban services; (b) improve the
functioning of the chain of command for the collection of business and property taxes, which are the
City's two main sources of revenue; and (c) set up more appropriate financial management
procedures for the City and communes of Conakry, to ensure that adequate resources will be allocated
to identified priority services. These measures are the continuation of activities begun under the
Second Urban Project.  However, the linkage with the technical components (solid waste
management and neighborhood upgrading) is strengthened in the following ways: (a) local financing
objectives are scaled to the anticipated counterpart investment contribution and, indirectly, to
recurrent costs; and (b) resource mobilization considerations for the City are supplemented by an
effort to better allocate those resources. Risks identified at appraisal led to a decision for the staged
implementation of certain activities included in this sub-component. This applies to the improvement
of the fiscal chain of command, for which the Government is expected, during the first year of Project
implementation, to make firm commitments to mechanisms to evaluate and share local tax revenues
within the urban area of Conakry. The Program's Phase 2 is subject to clarification of Conakry's
financing system. The main elements of this effort, identified during preparation, can be stated as
follows: (a) revision of arrangements governing the CFU in a manner more favorable to the City; (b)
allocation of 50% of the TWV (instead of 25%) to the City, and deposit of those revenues in a
maintenance account; and (c) revision of the mechanisms for imposing the business tax.
The sub-component includes two parts: a) improvement of the "fiscal chain"; and b) support for improved
financial management of the City and its communes.
*  The "fiscal chain" revolves around the completion of a fiscal census (covering CFU/TPU/business
tax) for the entire Conakry metropolitan area. This census would be prepared in 1999-2000; its
implementation would begin during Phase 1 (2000-2001) - as a pilot operation - and would continue
under Phase 2 (2002-2004).  The start-up of the pilot operations would be subject to the results
obtained during the census preparation; the citywide expansion of the census during Phase 2 would
also depend upon the results obtained under the pilot operations.
*  The support for improved financial management of the City and its communes involves two types of
intervention: a) urban, financial and organization audits of the City and communes of Conakry; and
(b) a training program designed on the basis of lessons learned from the audits and ad hoc studies
aimed at helping the Borrower meet the conditions for the start-up of Phase 2 of the Program. These



8
audits are expected to generate: (a) recommendations for the revision of the Ordinances of 1990
(attribution of responsibilities, financial resources); (b) new organizational charts, particularly for the
services under the Governorate; (c) improved financial relations with the SPTD; and (d) identification
of the main ongoing and planned investment and maintenance operations. These audits will be
governed by specific terms of reference, separate from those used for the secondary cities
(Component 2). They will be carried out under Phase 1 of the Program and supplemented by
financial and organizational audits to be performed annually under Phase 2 of the Program.
Cost: US$ 1.2 million.
Community outreach programs. The information, education and communication program is
expected to increase the population's awareness of the importance of signing up for garbage
collection service, and will provide information on the proposed fees to be charged by private
contractors. The program will also explain the new institutional arrangements and the role of public
and private agencies in Conakry's new solid waste management system. The program will include
the broadcast of about 300 television spots and 800 radio announcement in the country's various
languages. The program will finance sporting events, about 80 theater performances, information
sessions in schools for teachers and students, and district-level discussions aimed at neighborhood
authorities and women. Neighborhood cleanliness contests will be organized, and celebrations will
be held to encourage SMEs that have been successful in recruiting subscribers or that have
demonstrated efficient management. The program is expected to result in extensive awareness of the
City of Conakry's health and hygiene regulations. The community outreach programs will also
include activities pertaining to other components as needed.
Cost: US$ .3 million.

2.    KEY POLICY AND INSTlTUTIoNAL REFORMS SUPPORTED BY THE PROJECT
The recently signed Urban Sector Policy Letter announces several reforms initiated by the Government
that will be supported by the project. These reforms are mainly concerned with decentralization of local
authority, increased reliance on the private sector for the provision of local public services, and public
procurement procedures.
The project will support decentralization, especially through the introduction of resource sharing
regulations more favorable to the communes. Measures taken under the project will help revise the
distribution of fiscal revenues between the central government, the City and the communes; ensure that
local tax revenues collected by the Ministry of Finance on behalf of the City and communes are actually
handed over, and that these revenues are adequate for the tasks they are supposed to cover. The project
will give the administrations of secondary cities the tools and methodologies they need to identify their
needs, plan operations, select firms and contractors, contract for works, and monitor and oversee those
works.
Increased beneficiary contributions to the financing of urban services, and the promotion of private sector
participation in service delivery, will support the central government's policy of withdrawal from such
activities. The introduction of procedures and programs geared to various capacity levels of contractors,
and the substantial increase in the volume of public works to be contracted out to small contractors in the
informal sector, will encourage withdrawal and open public service activities to private operators.
The project will support the recent reform of public procurement rules, by testing accelerated procedures
for small contracts specifically adjusted to the capacities of municipalities.
3.    BENEFITS AND TARGET POPULATION
3.1   Inhabitants of Conakry and secondary cities
* Improvement of sanitary conditions. The project is expected to improve sanitary conditions by: (a)
reducing the incidence of diseases caused by poor sanitation (e.g., cholera); and (b) improving the
quality of the urban environment through better solid waste collection and sanitary disposal.
Approximately 800,000 inhabitants will benefit from improved garbage collection services and
reduced exposure to sanitation-related diseases.
*  Provision of access roads. The repair or provision of access roads for currently inaccessible
neighborhoods in Conakry will entail considerable advantages for the residents of those
neighborhoods. The reduced cost and duration of trips to other areas within the city will reduce
health risks (by making dispensaries more accessible), improve educational opportunities (by making
secondary schools and universities more accessible), and increase job opportunities (by improving
access to distant zones of economic activity). Within neighborhoods, greater ease of access will
foster the emergence of local trade and services and enhance public safety. These advantages will
have the largest impact on the most inaccessible pre-project neighborhoods.   Since these
neighborhoods usually house the poorest segments of the population, it is these populations that will
see the most dramatic improvement in their living conditions and quality of life. In addition, the
temporary hiring of jobless local residents by contractors performing works will bring additional
revenues into these neighborhoods.



11
* Construction of primary and secondary roads. The construction of primary roads and
rehabilitation of secondary and access roads will have the following positive impacts: (a) easier
access for residents of the most populated districts of Ratoma and Matoto to the administrative and
financial services located in Kaloum; (b) better access to urban and social services and greater
mobility; (c) better traffic fluidity amnong neighborhoods and between the capital, the outskirts of
Conakry and the rest of the country; and (d) easier access to the new Kagbelen landfill, which will
help hasten the conversion of the La Miniere landfill site.
3.2    Local governments. The project will support increased mobilization of local authorities. In
Conakry, mayors will be involved in neighborhood upgrading programs; in secondary cities, they will, by
signing their Municipal Contracts, make decisions on priority community improvement investments to be
financed by the project.
3.3    Private Sector. The implementation of the Emergency Solid Waste Program at the end of the
Second Urban Project proved that the use of small- and medium-scale contractors is an effective way to
improve service delivery. Tlle project should be able to create about 4,000 jobs in connection with the
privatization of household garbage collection, street cleaning and the use of labor-intensive trash
collection techniques. Users, who are in the best position to judge the quality of service, started paying in
1997 for garbage collection, which is now provided efficiently. The project is expected to strengthen the
managerial and marketing capacities of over 30 small waste collection contractors and create a diversified
web of skills in the area of urban service delivery. The introduction of procedures and programs, geared
to the varying capabilities of contractors in the areas of routine and periodic maintenance on secondary
roads, should contribute to a substantial increase in the volume of public works, that can be contracted out
to small contractors in the informal sector and to consulting firms in Conakry and the secondary cities.
4.    INSTIrUTIONAL AN] IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
Implementation period: 3 years (I 999-2002)
Executing agencies: Project Unit/City of Conakry/DATU/SPTD/DNI
Project coordination: Ministry of Urban Planning and Housing (MUTHJ
Project Implementation
4.1  The experience of the Second Urban Project showed the need to put in place a streamlined entity
charged solely with implementing the project. This entity would be given a single, clear mandate, a
procedures manual, and an operating budget. The experience of entrusting project management to a
national sectoral department revealed its limitations. The department had neither the personnel nor the
required operating budget, and thus depended too much on expatriate technical assistance.  An
organizational chart for the proposed unit is attached in Annex 7. In order to continue the considerable
institutional strengthening efforts, the Project Unit will rely on units created under the previous project
(UDP2) and on existing administrative structures.
* The SPTD (formerly UPSU), a public service of the City of Conakry, will play a key role in setting
up the "solid waste management" sub-component since it will have two essential missions, namely:
(a) transport of garbage from transfer zones to the Miniere landfill; and (b) management of the
landfill. The reorganization of UPSU and its transformation into SPTD was a condition of project
negotiations and led to the re-emergence of a more streamlined entity (80 employees instead of 353).
It has a more clearly delineated and less ambitious mandate, and will function on the basis of a
procedures manual and a transparent accounting system.



12
* The Secondary Road Maintenance Unit (Cellule d'entretien de la Voirie Secondaire), created under
the Second Urban Project within the technical services of the City of Conakry, will implement the
"neighborhood upgrading" sub-component. In particular, it will be in charge of scheduling works,
prepanng bidding documents, and monitoring and implementing works.
* The Urban Development Department (DATU) received technical assistance for technical studies and
monitoring of primary road works under the Second Urban Project. DATU will continue to perform
this function and be responsible for the "primary road networks" sub-component.
*  The Urban Programming Unit (the former Cellule d'adressage renamed the Cellule de
Programmation Urbaine), created under the Second Urban Project, will continue to update Conakry's
adressage system and implement the "Support to Secondary Cities" component.
* The Project Unit, in close collaboration with the DNI and the financial services of the Govemorate,
will be in charge of the component dealing with the improvement of financing for priority services. It
will be supported by technical assistance on an as-needed basis. The survey and fiscal census tasks
will be subjected to competitive bidding. The technical and financial services of the Governorate and
of the five communes will be involved in the preparation of audits. The urban, organization and
financial audits of Conakry will be entrusted to consultants.
Financial Reporting and Audits
4.2  An autonomous Project Unit will be set up to implement project activities. The Unit will be
responsible for project accounts and administrative and financial management. It will handle all project
disbursements in accordance with IDA guidelines and will ensure the coordination of activities under the
project. The Government will open a project account in a commercial bank for counterpart funds (BND).
For purposes of project management, accounts will be opened at commercial banks acceptable to IDA
(Special IDA Account, SPTD operating account, SPTD materiel depreciation account, and a secondary
roads account).
4.3  A computerized accounting system, including a manual of administrative, financial and accounting
procedures will be created for the Project Unit by a qualified consultant. The accounting system will
make it possible to maintain general cost accounting in conformity with accepted international accounting
standards (IASC) as well as analytical accounting and integrated budgeting. The SPTD will, in keeping
with its status as an Etablissement public administratif (EPA), maintain separate accounts with a
procedures manual approved by IDA. The systems will produce analytical and budgetary monitoring
reports, as well as financial statements and statement of accounts for the annual audit. The Project Unit's
accounting system will be sufficiently flexible and adaptable to produce the new, quarterly financial
management reports (PMRs) in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Administration Initiative
(LACI), after the first 18 months of the project.
4.4  The Project Unit and SPTD accounts will be audited by an independent auditing firm. acceptable to
IDA. The auditor will provide an opinion, in separate reports, on the financial statements, the certified
statements of expenditure, the use of Special Account funds, and will make recommendations for
strengthening internal controls. The Governorate's accounts will also be reviewed by the auditor.
4.5  The recruitment of an auditing firm, approval of the SPTD's procedures manual, and creation of a
procedures manual and computerized accounting system for the Project Unit, are conditions of Credit
effectiveness.



13
Supervision
4.6  Supervision Missions. The project will be supervised on a regular basis by visiting Bank missions
to review progress, evaluate performance, visit works sites, and scrutinize project management. Bank
missions will provide ad hoc technical assistance and advice as needed.
4.7 Annual Reviews and Beneficiary Surveys. Annual reviews will be organized by the Guinean
Government, the Project. Unit, municipalities and the Association to evaluate the effectiveness of the
program. Each annual review will contain a summary of beneficiaries' "assessment" of the program.
4.8  Mid-term Review. A mid-term review will be carried out 18 months after project effectiveness.
Phase 2 will be evaluated 6 months before the end of Phase 1.
D. PROJECT RATIONALE
1.    PROJECT ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED AND REASONS FOR REJECTION
Several alternatives were examined and rejected:
1.1  The first alternative involved an AGETIP-type project: this option was rejected since the
Government was not receptive during project preparation. It should be noted that AGECO, which was
created in the context of a roads project in 1992, never became operational. It may be necessary, in the
medium term, to reconsider the creation of a delegated public works agency, especially with the
construction activities in secondary cities.
1.2 The second alternative consisted of designing a purely urban environment project. This is what
was initially envisaged. This option was dropped since it would have failed to incorporate the Second
Urban Project's numerous achievements in infrastructure and priority service delivery.
1.3  The third option would have been a project supporting decentralization and municipal
management, in keeping with the current trend in other countries of the sub-region. This possibility was
rejected; it seemed wiser to adopt an incremental and prudent approach, since decentralization is in its
infancy and/or the regulatory framework is not fully in place.  This cautious approach gave rise to
Component 2, "Support to Secondary Cities," which will initially limit itself to helping 10 municipalities
take stock of their priority infrastructure and equipment needs and the required institutional and financial
measures. This approach will also be apparent in the support for resource mobilization for the City and
communes of Conakry.
2.    RATIONALE FOR THE PROJECT DESIGN
2.1    The current project reconciles three objectives: (a) it supports the decentralization process by
including interventions in secondary cities; (b) it aims to improve urban living conditions, especially in
Conakry, by facilitating the population's access to basic services; and (c) it seeks to improve the
mobilization of local resources.
(a)  Solid waste management. The considerable changes brought about under the emergency waste
management program have made an undeniable improvement in the living conditions of residents of the
Kaloum, Dixinn and Matam districts. The benefits of this program need to be extended to the most
populous districts, Ratoma and Matoto. Household waste management and reliable financing of services



14
are essential for better living conditions and are still a real concern for city residents as well as for
municipal managers.
(b)  Neighborhood upgrading. A project variant that would have consisted of the mechanisms applied
under the Second Urban Project to identify and implement road rehabilitation works was not introduced.
These arrangements, based on a logic of protecting existing infrastructure assets, involve heavy
rehabilitation operations on already improved road stretches. They make it difficult to take into account
the wishes of residents of inaccessible neighborhoods, and are also not conducive to the involvement of
local authorities. The direct financing of maintenance works was rejected since it offered no guarantee of
sustainability beyond the project implementation period. The system chosen, in which infrastructure
rehabilitation is financed at a level corresponding to the Borrower's (previously demonstrated)
maintenance capacities, is expected to ensure greater sustainability of maintenance activities.
(c)  Primary road network. Initially, there was no plan to include the primary roads sub-component
in the Third Urban Development Project. This sub-component was subsequently added: (a) to comply
with the Government's official request; and (b) to improve traffic fluidity between the City of Conakry,
its outskirts and the rest of the country. This sub-component will also be directly responsible for
facilitating access to the Kagbelen landfill.
(d)  Support to improved financing of priority services. The name of this component emphasizes the
change in orientation from the Second Urban Project regarding local resource mobilization. The chosen
approach is intended to be less general and more targeted to needs resulting from the financing of solid
waste management and road maintenance (quantification of anticipated performance and mechanisms for
guaranteeing and allocating resources to the SPTD and road maintenance). However, since local tax
revenues essentially remain the primary source of financing (over 70% of the City's budget), efforts
continue to be made in this area, but with a more operational approach: involving the DNI, strengthening
of the adressage unit, which has been turned into a programming unit, and using specific ad hoc technical
assistance.

4.    LESSONS LEARNED AND REFLECTED IN THE PROJECT DESIGN
4.1    Past projects (First and Second Urban Projects) have yielded four main lessons:  use
progranming expertise, distinguish between public and private roles, persevere the mobilization of local
finances, and streamline administrative procedures.
*  Using programming expertise. The previous projects showed that the government organized its
interventions in three steps: planning, programming, implementation. This approach was followed
for the Regional Development Plan and the Master Development Plan for the capital: the Third
Urban Development Project is supposed to implement activities that were planned and programmed
under the First and Second Projects. These projects have made big improvements in traffic
circulation and commerce in Conakry, but after years of neglect, the need is still considerable.
Therefore, it seemed critical to extend the efforts by financing the construction of two important
stretches of road in the primary network (T7 and the voze express). A similar approach was applied to
the secondary cities: planning will generate the programming of priority interventions to be
performed under the Third Urban Development Project.
*  Distinguishing between public and private roles. The First Urban Project followed a period of
centrally managed economy, during which the private sector had all but disappeared and the
administration was supposed to handle all interventions, from design to production. For example,
solid waste collection and disposal were handled by the communes' administration (UPSU). Thus,
under the previous projects, the following items were financed: (a) the acquisition of garbage trucks
and spare parts; (b) UPSU's operating costs; and (c) the city's costs for garbage collection and
disposal, with no user contributions. This approach did not yield the desired results: in 1997, only
20% of the solid waste generated by the city was collected and disposed. Implementation of the Solid
Waste Emergency Program has confirmed that delegation of collection services to private operators is
far more effective. Collection has increased to about 80 percent in the districts of Kaloum, Matam
and Dixinn. The proposed project will therefore be based on the following elements: (a) delegation of
service delivery to the private sector; (b) establishment of an enabling institutional framework with
clearly defined roles for public agencies and private operators; (c) development of performance
indicators; (d) enforcement of the Public Health and Hygiene Act; and (e) recovery of collection costs
by means of user fees. As safe disposal of refuse has wider public health benefits, transfer and
disposal costs will continue to be financed through municipal resources and, if necessary, with central
government resources.
*  Persevering the mobilization of local finances. The two preceding projects sought to improve local
financing but, aside from a few successes, such as the improvement of revenues from municipal
markets (which account for 4 percent of the City's resources), results have been modest. Indeed, the
habit of paying taxes was lost during the long tenure of the "welfare state." While the government
passed laws concerning the TPU, CFU and housing taxes, implementation has been difficult. It
should be noted, however, that the most significant results have been obtained when the improvement
of local finances is presented as a means of obtaining project funds. Despite the predicted difficulties,
the Third Urban Development Project intends to help the government continue its previous efforts in
this area, spurred by the need to: (a) increase collection efficiency of existing taxes; (b) allocate taxes
and public revenues according to the level of responsibility of each tier of government; and (c)
simultaneously improve municipal management and rationalize expenditures.
*  Streamlining administrative proceduires. Under the previous projects, implementation of physical
components was delayed by customs regulations and lengthy and cumbersome procurement and
contract signing procedures. Applying procurement procedures designed for large contractors and



17
firms to small-scale private contractors is detrimental to the development of the local private sector.
This approach has led to the situation where small private contractors have to sub-contract the works
to large companies. Appropriate procurement procedures will therefore be used under the Third
Urban Development Project, especially for the neighborhood upgrading component.
5.    INDICATIONS OF BORROWER COMMITMENT AND OWNERSHIP
5.1  The results obtained under the First and Second Urban Projects inspired the Borrower's decision to
commit to a Third Urban Development Project. The government clearly defined its goal of solid waste
management with a large-scale interim solid waste management program, institutional reforms in the
urban sector, and strong community involvement in the financing of technical services through
counterpart funds. The restructuring of the former UPSU through staff reductions and the heavy
involvement of SMEs in solid waste management, are signs of private sector promotion, one of the
primary themes of the nation's urban development and housing policy. In addition, the borrower is
willing to define, in consultation with its financial partners, a flexible solution to the procurement and
contract signature procedures by the administration.
6.    VALUE ADDED OF BANK SUPPORT IN THIS PROJECT
6.1  The Bank has been involved in Guinea's urban sector since the early 1980's. Given the weak
investments of other donors in the sector, it is the lead institution as far as strategic dialogue and
investments are concerned.
E. SUMMARY PROJECT ANALYSIS
1.    ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
l.l  Solid Waste Program. The economic costs and benefits of a solid waste program are always
difficult to quantify due to the intangible nature of benefits, such as health and quality of life. Therefore,
a comparison of the cost-effectiveness of various service delivery options for collection and transfer to the
landfill was undertaken. This analysis found that a system involving collection by carts, transfer to
grouping points and transfer, in two shifts, of garbage to the landfill in trucks bearing large-capacity
containers was more cost-efficient than the same system using a single work shift and dump trucks.
1.2  Neighborhood Upgrading (Desenclavement de quartiers). Road rehabilitation and construction
carried out under this component will have the following impact on the local economy: (a) reduced travel
time; (b) reduced vehicle operating costs; (c) reduced works rehabilitation costs (due to a lengthening of
their useful life); (d) reduced transport times (due to a reduction of the demand on the primary network
and an increase in the use of alternate routs); (e) improved mobility for the population (more accessible
employment areas and expanded transport activity); (f) development of trade and local service activities
in previously inaccessible neighborhoods; (g) use of local inputs; (h) development of technical skills of
existing contractors, and creation of new contractors, due to the increased volume of public works within
the reach of very small contractors; and (i) creation of jobs for local contractors. The criteria for the
selection of PROP contractors will take into account the amount of sub-contracting to SMEs or very small
contractors for the simplest works, the amount of local inputs and labor, and perhaps the implementation
time to which the enterprise can commit. The pricing details supplied by the contractors will distinguish



18
labor, local inputs and inputs subject to tax exemption, to make it easier to monitor the impact on the local
economy.
1.3  Primary Roads. The calculation of the economic rate of return in the previous studies will be
confirmed at the beginning of Phase 1 by the Primary Roads Unit.
2.    FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
2.1  The duration of the project requires a steady implementation of about US$ 6 million per year:
works and facilities represent 63 percent of costs; studies, training and support, 25 percent; operations 6
percent. An allocation of 9 percent has been allowed for contingencies and 3 percent for refinancing the
PPF. IDA financing accounts for 92 percent of total project costs. Local counterpart funding (8 percent)
involves the central government (5 percent), the Governorate and communes of Conakry (2 percent), and
selected secondary cities (1 percent). Forty-five percent of the project will be financed in local currency,
compared to 55 percent in foreign currency. The Central Government is the only entity responsible for
IDA credit reimbursement. There is no retrocession from the central government to the local government.
The Government, Gouvemorate, and the municipalities will participate in local currencies. In order to
have an overall view of the project, the counterpart funding effort of the Governorate and communes of
Conakry will need to take into account the recurrent costs associated with the SPTD's operations (see
Annex 4). Thus, the operation of solid waste management services and improved management of road
maintenance will require, by the end of Phase 1 (i.e., in 3 years), a 30 percent increase (in real terms) of
the Governorate's resources and, to a lesser extent, in those of the communes of Conakry. These costs are
estimated at US$ 3.1 million, spread over the Project's implementation period. Thus, the expected
increase in the resources of the Govemorate and its five communes amounts to about 900 million GNFs.
On the other hand, the financial burden on the Governorate of Conakry is already2 lightened by a
mecnanism for financing household garbage collection: this service is handled by SMEs, which bill users.
The cost of this service, when extended to the entire city (5 communes), is estimated at about 1 billion
GNF per year. For reasons related to the conveyance of investments under the Third Urban Development
Project, SPTD's materiel depreciation costs will be covered by the central government in the form of
annual deposits into an account opened by SPTD.
2.2    Over the long term, privatization of transport and disposal of garbage will result in a reduction of
unit costs and increased efficiency. The financing, at the end of the project, of the costs of the transition
to the landfill at Kagbelen, is also problematic. The scope for increasing collection fees, in order to
finance part of the cost of garbage transfer and disposal, will need to be studied. It may prove difficult for
small entrepreneurs to obtain the revolving funds and credit needed to finance the right equipment for
garbage collection. The cost of compost, and the existence of an emerging market, will directly influence
the degree to which composting can be integrated into future solid waste management activities.
3.    INSTITUTIONAL IMPACTS
3.1    The project supports the decentralization program begun by the Government. Several of the
arrangements to be implemented represent a big step toward greater autonomy for local governments, to
the extent that they have more scope to assume the role of a contracting authority: (a) the completion of
the transfer of financial responsibility for secondary road maintenance and garbage collection to
municipalities and the City of Conakry, which successfully began under the Second Urban Project, will
2 Since this service was only partially covered by the fonner UPSU, its transfer does not constitute a reduction in the
City's budget.



19
demonstrate their ability to deliver basic services that the central government has practically ceased to
provide; (b) this transfer will become more viable with the introduction of more equitable rules for the
distribution of local tax revenues to the communes; (c) the technical capacities of the Governorate's
operational units will be strengthened through several supporting measures and close coordination of
these measures with the Project Unit; and (d) secondary cities will be provided with expertise, tools and
methods that will help them to better identify their issues and needs.
3.2    The project is also the part of another recent institutional development: that of public procurement
procedures. The project may benefit from the reformn of the Public Procurement Code, which aims in
particular to shorten procedures, and may help clarify responsibilities in the process of preparing and
approving contracts. In addition, the project will make it possible to test, using the methods of other
administrations (e.g., DNER), various types of contracts tailored to the managerial capacities of the
communes and to the technical and financial capabilities of contractors.
4.     SOCIAL IMPACTS
4.1    The population's commitment to the interim waste management program has been demonstrated
by its contribution to financing collection services and the support lent by political and administrative
authorities to service delivery by the private sector. An information and communication campaign will be
carried out during the project implementation period to ensure that the population is thoroughly informed
about the implementation of the identified activities and that the population participates.
5.    ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
5,1  The project falls under environmental category B. It is expected that all the project components
will lead to an improved urban environment through increased solid waste collection, cleaner gutters, and
fewer traffic jams in the city. The solid waste component will have two positive environmental impacts:
(a) increased solid waste removal from the heavily populated areas; and (b) a cleaner environment. The
disposal site will be operated as a sanitary landfill and a comprehensive monitoring plan will be
implemented. Studies and technical assistance will be provided to ensure that the landfill is built and
operated in a sanitary and ecological manner. Numerous environmental studies have been conducted on
solid waste management, focusing on (a) reliance on private operators for garbage collection; (b) the
financial and institutional arrangements for the transfer of garbage; and (c) the existing and new landfills.
The following studies will be carried out during the project:
* Confirmation of the site of the Kagbelen landfill
*  Closure of the Miniere landfill
*  Local consultations with residents in the vicinity of the Kagbelen landfill
*  Development of the Kagbelen landfill
*  Follow-up environmental study of the Miniere landfill
5.2    Works planned under the neighborhood upgrading component will be of limited scope and their
negative environmental impact will be minor (in terms of waste volume, surface area involved, population
affected, etc.), at the construction stage as well as at the operating stage. However, the programs will
include a large number of environmentally oriented operations (cleaning of drains, and especially the
cleaning of ditches and off-street gutters) which could involve some negative impacts depending on how
they are designed, carried out and managed. In order to avoid delaying implementation operations with
little or no impact that do not require any studies, the identification and handling of potential negative
impacts of eligible PLIC and PROP operations will occur "ex ante" for each program. This task will be
performed using the World Bank's method for identifying and classifying environmental impacts of road



20
works.
5.3    Regarding the "support for secondary cities" component, the environmental impact of each
subproject will be analyzed using a questionnaire prepared during the urban audit.
5.4  Regarding the involuntary settlement of populations, there is no foreseen displacement of people.
The La Miniere landfill site is unoccupied. The Kagbelen site has been declared a public domain and its
perimeter has been fenced to prevent illegal occupation. As of the project appraisal, rights-of-way of the
planned T7 and voze express roads were free of occupation. Therefore, their construction should not
involve any resettlement as long as their rights-of-way remain free of illegal occupation.
6.    PARTICIPATORY APPROACH
6.1  The project's lengthy preparation phase made it possible to ensure the participation of technical
services and municipalities, political authorities and neighborhood groups in the definition of those
intervention upon which the project is to be based. Various studies were prepared by the national services
and by Guinean professionals. The waste management and neighborhood upgrading programs were
defined in cooperation with authorities of communes and the Governorate, as well as with relevant
neighborhood dwellers.
F. SUSTAINABILITY AND RISKS
1.    SUSTAINABILITY
1.1    The project will create conditions for its own sustainability by striving, through its main
components, to improve regular service delivery and the payment of maintenance costs. Regarding solid
waste management and secondary roads maintenance, the project's sustainability depends upon: (a) the
authorities' ability to mobilize the required resources on an annual basis; (b) a clear delineation of the
roles of the central government, local communities (Governorate and districts) and the private sector; (c)
an increase in managerial capacities of the services and entities in charge of those activities; and (d) the
continuation of the participatory approach. These conditions were encouraged and progressively created
under the Second Urban Project and during preparation of the Third Urban Development Project. The
project implementation period (3 years) and the performance criteria imposed as conditions of starting
certain investment operations (whether in Phase 1 or Phase 2) should make it easier to maintain these
condition and project managers' commitment to them. Continued training and ad hoc technical assistance
are important guarantors of sustainability. The sustainability of the primary road works planned for Phase
2 is expected to be ensured by the allocation of a portion of the Roads Fund to maintenance of these
roads. Finally, the Municipal Adjustment Programs (MAPs) put in place in secondary cities should make
it easier to create the conditions required to maintain assets provided under the PIPs. More generally, the
strengthening of the Project Unit and the "support to the financing of priority services" component are
additional means at the administration's disposal to ensure the sustainability of the interventions and
urban management improvements initiated under the project.



21
2.     CRITICAL RISKS
(reflecting assumptions in the fourth column of Annex 1):
2.1    Risks are of three types: a) extreme risks linked to the more or less favorable macro-economic

ANNEX 2 - DESCRIPTION OF COMPONENTS
Component 1: INFRASTRUCTURE AND PRIORITY SERVICES IN CONAKRY
Sub-component 1 - Solid Waste
Context and objectives
The signing on June 23, 1998 of solid waste collection concession agreements with 23 contractors marked
the completion of the process of privatization of solid waste collection, which had begun in May 1997
with six contractors in the Kaloum, Matam and Dixinn districts. The process began with the dismantling
of the Unit6 de Pilotage des Services Urbains (UPSU) and the creation of the Service Public de Transfert
des D6chets (SPTD), which is a public entity (etablissement public a caractere administratif) responsible
for the transfer and dumping of household waste.
Thirty small and medium contractors and two subcontractors will handle household garbage collection in
34 collection zones covering the City of Conakry.  This important reform of household waste
management follows many years of purely public management. It has brought about an improvement in
waste collection levels and in the population's living conditions: collection levels increased from 20
percent to 80 percent in less than a year in collection zones. The volume of garbage collected rose from
2,400 m3 in June 1997 to 17,000 m3 in April 1998. The number of jobs created jumped from 27 to 1,582
during the same period. A total of 30,378 households are served, out of a total of 58,967. Thus, one out
of two households is served and, in certain zones of the city (I, III and VI), service rates now stand at 80
percent. Fees charged to households range from 1,000 to 5,000 GNF and the level of fee recovery is
about 73 percent. Monthly revenues collected are estimated at 43 million GNF, out of a total of 59
million GNF billed.
The solid waste management sub-component has the following objectives: (a) bring the volume of waste
collected in the city to the 80 percent level; (b) limit the environmental impact of solid waste; (c) increase
the operational and managerial capacities of the SPTD (Service Public de Transfert des Dechets) and
develop the technical and managerial capacities of small waste collection contractors; and (d) start a pilot
household waste composting project.
Content
The solid waste management sub-component includes: (a) infrastructure works; (b) equipment and
facilities acquisition; (c) a program of support, training, information and institutional strengthening for
SMEs and the SPTD, and (d) preparation of studies needed to carry out works associated with the closing
of the La Miniere landfill site and opening of the Kagbelen landfill.
Infrastructure works include: (a) construction of 30 grouping points of at least 600m2 each in the Matoto
and Ratoma districts; (b) rehabilitation of 2 km of roads affording access to the grouping points; (c)
installation of hydrostatic pressure gauges and a program for monitoring groundwater quality at the La
Miniere landfill site; and (d) construction of a pilot composting station on the Miniere site, with a
treatment capacity of about 15,000 m3/year of household waste.
The project will finance the acquisition of (a) 15 containers with a capacity of 24 m3 to be placed at the
new grouping points; (b) three transfer trucks, one support truck and service vehicles for the SPTD and



27
the Governorate's Public Sanitation Division (Division de la Salubrite); and (d) one bulldozer and one
compactor to be used at the Miniere landfill site.
The project will finance a program of support, training, information and institutional strengthening for
small garbage collection contractors and the SPTD. This program will make it possible to: (a) establish,
by the Government, a guarantee fund of about US$ 115,000 at a local commercial bank to facilitate
access to capital improvement credit for SMEs involved in household garbage collection, (b) develop and
implement training programs for staff and managers of SMEs and provide them with technical assistance
in financial management; (c) train managers and SPTD operational staff and develop a program of
support for accounting, administrative and financial management for SPTD; (d) train the staff of the
Division de la Salubrite and district sanitation services; (e) develop and implement an information,
education and communication campaign to promote enrollment in the waste collection/disposal service
and promote the marketing of compost; and (f) provide technical assistance for the production of good
quality compost and development of compost quality norms.
Finally, the project will finance the preparation of studies relative to the post-closure works at the La
Miniere landfill site, as well as studies to confirm the siting of the Kagbelen landfill, and environmental
impact studies of the latter site. The studies will help ensure that the second phase of the program is
carried out in an efficient and cost-effective manner.
Implementation
The Project Unit will be responsible for preparing bidding documents relative to works on the grouping
points, the composting station and the equipping of SPTD's offices (in liaison with SPTD). Bidding
documents for supplies and for consultants to perform studies will also be prepared by the Project Unit in
collaboration with SPTD. A person responsible for support to SMEs will work in the Project Unit. That
individual's mission will be to help SMEs improve their service delivery, increase their client base, and
improve their financial management, through programs of training and re-training, and ensure more
effective interactions between SMEs and the SPTD. The Unit will work with the SPTD and the districts'
technical services to supervise the activities of SMEs. Terms of reference for this SME support position
were prepared during the mission and have been agreed upon.
Garbage collection by SMEs will be deposited at 40 grouping points. The waste will be collected from
these grouping points, transferred and dumped by the SPTD, which will also see that the La Miniere site
is operated under better conditions. The rehabilitation of the La Miniere landfill will allow waste to be
spread out and compacted more efficiently and in better hygiene and working conditions. SPTD's
operations, garbage transfer, and dumping activities will be financed by a capital endowment from the
Governorate. The local resource mobilization program supported by the project is expected to enable the
Governorate to finance these activities.
Environmental monitoring of the La Miniere landfill will be performed under the supervision of the
Direction de 1'Environnement on the basis of a letter of understanding with one or more local
laboratories. This will involve monitoring the quality of groundwater by means of four hydrostatic
pressure gauges located upstream and downstream of the landfill. Analyses of pH levels, electrical
resistance, cations and anions (Cl-, NO3, S04, NH4-, K+, Na+), biochemical compounds (DCO, DBO5), and
microorganisms (e.g., coliform bacteria) will be carried out every three months, using data from the
downstream hydrostatic pressure gauges, and once a year, using data from the upstream instruments.
Street cleaning will no longer be the responsibility of the SPTD, and street cleaning concession contracts
for primary and secondary roads in the City of Conakry will be awarded to SMEs for each of the districts
as follows: 17 km of roads in Kaloum, 16 km in Dixinn, 25 km in Matam, 16 km in Matoto, and 20 km in



28
Ratoma. These contracts will be for three years, with one renewal, and will be financed by the
Governorate and the districts on a monthly payment basis. SPTD will be responsible for quality control
in street cleaning.
A pilot composting station will be built in order to use a portion of the solid waste for the processing of
about 6,000m3 of solid waste per year, yielding about 3,000 tons of compost. A private firm, chosen
through competitive bidding, will operate the composting station. The contract will be for a three-year
duration. The selected operator will pay SPTD a monthly rent for the site and will receive solid waste
transported by SPTD at no cost. This operator will assume any commercial risks and will market the
compost. The project will support compost marketing activities and will provide technical assistance to
improve the quality of the compost produced and develop quality norms.
A guarantee fund containing US$ 115,000 will be deposited in a local commercial bank and will serve to
back up 80% of the loans granted by this financial institution to SMEs. The loans will be made from the
commercial bank's resources, and on the basis of its usual risk assessment procedures. A letter of
agreement between the commercial bank, the Project Unit, and the government will govern the use of the
guarantee funds.  This letter will indicate the procedures for accessing the funds and will develop
performance criteria for the granting of loans. Debts will be highlighted and broken down by interest and
capital. The guarantee fund will cover 80 percent of the remaining capital. The commercial bank can use
the guarantee fund once it has put together a set of customary procedures for collecting sums due. The
commercial bank will develop mechanisms for the pre-litigation stage of debt collection, rapid debt
reminders, final notices to pay, and recovery of unpaid maturities. Interest on the fund will be used to
partially finance the promotion of the program, and will be reinvested in the guarantee fund itself
T=he commercial bank will prepare a biannual report on the status of the guarantee fund and the program
of loans to SMEs. This report will be conveyed to the Government, the Project Unit and the Association.
The commercial bank, the Government and the Project Unit will meet annually with two representatives
of SMEs that have received loans.
The cost of the sub-component is estimated at 3.6 million USD.

COMPONENT 1: INFRASTRUCTURE AND PRIORITY SERVICES IN CONAKRY
Sub-component 2 - Neighborhood upgrading
Context and Objectives
Works to be financed under this component for the rehabilitation or improvement of secondary roads in
Conakry are geared to one or the other of the following two objectives: (a) putting into service, or
restoring to service, secondary neighborhood connector roads in order to improve accessibility (especially
access problems caused by topography, the layout of railways and certain primary roads), and to ease the
burden on the primary roads network; and (b) providing a medium of access for the most inaccessible
neighborhoods in order to put them within reach of public transportation, and allow their residents to take
advantage of major public services (e.g., health) that are currently difficult for them to reach.
Content
The component includes three categories of works: (a) maintenance works (routine or periodic
maintenance on dirt roads: resurfacing, patching, recontouring) aimed at preserving the level of service of
the rehabilitated assets, and especially those rehabilitated under the Second or Third Urban Projects; (b)
rehabilitation works aimed at restoring existing assets to service (repairs to drains and to dirt or paved
roads: regraveling, patching, shoulder repair, etc.); (c) new, minimal construction works aimed at bringing
thoroughfares that are still impossible into service: bulldozing, contouring or infill; surfacing (paving);
water-crossings (fords, bridges, culverts).
The component will also finance additional expenditures needed for its implementation by the services of
the Governorate and the Project Unit: (a) services and logistics required to program and implement works
planned under the Project: studies, technical assistance, consumables (except for salaries and other fixed
operating costs); and (b) equipment and training services needed to strengthen the technical capacity of
the Governorate to manage the secondary road network.
Implementation
Infrastructure works will include two types of programs, which will differ in terms of their progranming,
the contractors that perform them, their costs and financing, and their procurement and implementation
arrangements.
*  PLIC. A Programme L6ger d'lnitiative Communale will be drawn up each year for each district on
the basis of requests from authorities and the population. The PLIC for each district will be the object
of a single contract to be awarded to a small or very small enterprise, in accordance with simplified
procedures and entirely under local financing (see << costs >) section below). The PLIC will implement
the following non-mechanized maintenance works: flushing ditches, gutters or sewer inlets, trash
removal, deep patching, digging or contouring ditches in loose or rocky soils, filling potholes,
constructing dirt shoulders or sidewalks, manual contouring of rocky roadways, constructing or
repairing gutters, sewer inlets, downspouts, and constructing or repairing culverts.
* PROP. The Programme de RMhabilitations et d'Ouvertures Prioritaires will finance heavier or
mechanized works involving the creation or restoration of inter-neighborhood connectors, in order to
remedy access problems, especially those caused by topography, railroads and certain primary roads.
However, for complex works requiring special technical studies that cannot be done by the Project
Unit, the DNER, or the enterprise, will be eligible on an exceptional basis. New road or sidewalk
resurfacing operations will be done with concrete paving. Asphalting will be limited to rehabilitation



31
works. Works eligible for the PROP are the following: regrading roadways (using a grader), infilling
and compacting dirt roads (grader and compactor), grading new roadways (grader or bulldozer),
constructing or repairing drains (concrete-mixer), replacing or repairing of curbs (concrete-mixer),
resurfacing paved roads (grader, compactor, water tanker truck, finisher), re-edging paved roads
(compactor, finisher), paving sidewalks and roadways, and constructing culvert and railway
overpasses, and intersections. A PROP will be drawn up each year for each district. It will be 90 %
financed by IDA and entrusted to a large or medium-sized enterprise, in accordance with the usual
procedures. The environmental impact of activities occurring under the PLIC and the PROP will be
examined as programs are developed. The feasibility of operations will be checked, using the
analytical grid developed by IDA for urban road maintenance and rehabilitation activities.
The Project Unit will coordinate all activities under the component, through a task officer who will also
be in charge of the oprimary roads ) component. Implementation will be handled by the Secondary
Roads Unit (Cellule de Voirie Secondaire - CVS). The CVS will have the following responsibilities: (a)
coordinate district consultations, identify priorities, and prepare annual programs; (b) shortlist contractors;
(c) prepare bidding documents; (d) oversee works and certify invoices; and (e) record technical and
financial monitoring data.
The Project Unit will be responsible for handling or delegating the following tasks: (a) develop and
publish bidding documents and contract documentation in collaboration with the National Public
Procurement Directorate (Direction Nationale des Marches Publics); (b) amend these documents, as
necessary, based on the World Bank's observations; (c) issue bidding invitations and coordinate bid
opening; (d) manage the flow of procurement documentation among the relevant parties (DNMP, World
Bank, signatories); (e) pay firms for PROP contracts; and (f) ongoing or ad hoc publication of monitoring
indicators.
With the exception of salaries, the project will finance part of the operating costs needed to preserve the
continuity of the Roads Unit's activities (CVS). This financing will ensure continuity and avoid the
interruptions noted during the Second Urban Project. Periodic consultant services will help monitor the
Unit's work, guide its activities and determine its needs in terms of methodologies, equipment and
training. In order to allow the Unit to develop and streamline its programming activities, and give its
managers a clearer vision of the distribution and costs of its (very scattered) interventions, a computerized
mechanism for the technical and financial management of maintenance will be put in place.
Costs
The total volume of works to be performed under the project is valued at 5.2 million USD. The annual
budget of the PLICs will be 155,000 USD.

COMPONENT 1: INFRASTRUCTURE AND PRIORITY SERVICES IN CONAKRY
Sub-component 3 - Primary Roads
Context and objectives
Conakry has undergone disorderly expansion on a site that lends itself poorly to urban development, and
thus has contributed to the capital's economic paralysis.  In order to remedy this situation, the
Government prepared a Master City Plan under the First Urban Project. The Plan identifies the primary
roads, some of these roadways have been financed over the past few years by IDA (Second Urban
Project), the BND and various other donors. The significant, positive impact of these large roads on
Conakry's traffic led the Govemment to include a new stretch of primary roadway in the Third Urban
Development Project: a central road, the so-called voie express (or Leprince) and the transversal T7 (a
thoroughfare analogous to the T3 and T4 transversals financed under the Second Urban Project).
Construction of the voie express and the T7 supports two objectives: (a) improving vehicular traffic at
troublesome bottlenecks and especially on stretches leading from Conakry to the rest of the country; and
(b) accessing Kagbelen new landfill, on which construction is to begin under the Third Urban
Development Project.
The goal of Phase 1 is to finalize all the preparatory elements needed for implementation of works
planned under Phase 2.
Content
The roads selected for the Third Urban Development Project have been the subjects of studies:
•  Route Leprince/voie express: APD level, including layout, longitudinal and lateral profiles (study by
SGI under IDA/UDP2 financing - 1988).
-  Transversal T7: APS level, including layout, longitudinal and lateral profiles (study by SGI under
IDA/UDP2 financing - 1988).
The roads are slated to have the following characteristics:

The content of the component under Phase I will consist of: (a) updating prior economic analysis; (b)
finalizing implementation studies (topographic, geotechnical and engineering studies) and bidding
documents; and (c) preparatory works. These works will involve staking out the rights-of-way of the
roadways, displacement, as needed, of utility networks, improvement of drainage and of temporary roads
to facilitate access for local residents and surveillance of the rights-of-way.
Implementation
The Project Unit's civil engineer will coordinate the component. Implementation will be handled by
DATU's Cellule Voirie primaire (CVP), which will collaborate with the DNIR within the Ministry of
Public Works. The CVP will be responsible for: (a) carrying out, after consultation and selection of
specialized firms, the topographic and geotechnical studies for the voie express and the T7; (b) updating



34
previous economic studies of these roads; (c) updating engineering studies and preparing the
corresponding bidding documents; (d) implementing preparatory work (staking out, displacement of
networks as needed, dirt tracks); (e) ensuring the surveillance of the rights-of-way. In order to complete
tasks (b) and (c), the CVP may call on extemal assistance, which could also be asked to supplement
CVP's training program. Road works will be implemented under Phase 2.
Costs
Total costs are estimated at US$ 2.3 million.

COMPONENT 2: SUPPORT TO SECONDARY CITIES
Context and objectives
Guinea has for several years been engaged in a process of political, administrative and financial
decentralization, implemented in a gradual and deliberate manner. Urban administrations remain weak,
since their mayors lack the skills and resources required to handle their responsibilities.   Thus, they
frequently rely upon decentralized services that often have limited means at their own disposal. The
anarchic growth of various secondary cities has highlighted the urgent need to guide their development, in
order to facilitate the provision of infrastructure and facilities serving the population and protection of the
natural environment. To this end, the Guinean government drew up master city plans in 1989 for 13
secondary cities. The government intends to continue this effort and has identified priorities based on a
network of urban areas (grouping the country's 35 cities into 4 priority categories).
Guinea has also, during preparation of its SNAT, provided 10 cities with Master Plans, these documents
have been used to channel urban growth by identifying preferred expansion zones, major road rights-of-
way, boundaries of public facilities, zones to avoid developing due to their ecological value or riskiness,
etc. In the past, these documents were prepared by the central government with external assistance.
Local authorities were involved, but it became necessary to refine this procedure in order to better support
the process of decentralization and involve more national expertise, including that of the private sector.
For this reason, the Government included a <o support to secondary cities >> component in the Third Urban
Development Project.
The objectives of the component are to: (a) support the ongoing process of decentralization by helping
mayors to better plan for their constituencies' needs and by preparing a Priority Investment Project after
consultation with the population; (b) use this opportunity to pursue initiatives begun by DATU regarding
implementation of the SNAT; and (c) strengthen national expertise by involving the public and private
sectors in this effort.
Content
The component affects 10 cities and includes two sub-components: urban and financial audits in each
city, and works identified by those audits. The procedures will involve: (a) identifying, based on the
audits, the short- and medium-term needs of 10 municipalities; and (b) helping local authorities
(Municipality, deconcentrated services) to prepare a PIP and MAP in consultation with the population; (c)
making these programs official through a Municipal Contract to be signed by the Prefect and the Mayor,
and which documents their commitment to the choice and implementation of investments and measures to
improve municipal management; and (d) implementing the actions listed in the Municipal Contract.
These actions will take place during Phases 1 and 2 of the Third Urban Development Program.
(a)   Preparation of audits. The "urban and financial audits" will be simultaneously performed in
accordance with a framework, included in the Third Urban Development Project's implementation
manual. After a diagnostic analysis of the city, the "urban audit" will recommend a coherent set of
priority projects and maintenance works, the value of which will correspond to the budget envelope
determined by the financial audit. The "financial audit" will determine: (i) the city's financial capacities
and therefore the value of the investments to which it can aspire under the Third Urban Development
Project; and (ii) the adjustment measures the city is willing to take, especially to improve its management.
The "urban audit" consists of two parts: (a) a diagnostic analysis of the current situation based on an
inventory of infrastructure and facilities and on the desires expressed by the local authorities and
population. This is expected to reveal the city's current deficiencies, especially in the poorer



36
neighborhoods, and identify short-term needs to be addressed under the project; (b) Master Plan
defining the city's growth pattems 15 years hence, major roads, zones to be reserved for particular
uses and those requiring environmental protection. The Master Plan will identify measures to guide
the city's future growth and to meet future needs that could result from that growth. The "urban
audit" will include charts and maps (see framework) and DATU will provide the audit preparation
teams with the necessary blueprints, based on the existing documentation (maps, sketches, aerial
photos, etc.).
The "financial audit" will focus on financial and organizational matters and will document the city's
capacities. It will specify: (a) the investment envelope, and particularly the envelope that the Project
will be able to finance; (b) the amount of the city's yearly contribution (5% of the PIP); and (e) the
measures that the city is prepared to take to improve its management (MAP). A comparison of needs
and available funds will make it possible to rank priorities and choose, through negotiation, project to
be included in the PIP. These choices and decisions on the PIP and MAP will then become official
with the signing of the Municipal Contract by the Prefect, a central government representative, and
the Municipality.
(b)   Priority works.  These will be priority facilities and infrastructure projects under municipal
responsibility and aimed at improving the population's access to services. Eligible projects will belong to
the following categories: (i) infrastructure (roads, public lighting); (ii) administrative facilities (town hall,
civil registry office); (iii) collective social facilities (youth centers, all-purpose recreational fields); (iv)
commercial facilities (market, bus depots); and (v) environmental projects (stormwater drainage, flood
protection, school latrines with plumbing, garbage transfer points).
Implementation
Audits will be performed in collaboration with DATU under the supervision of the Urban Programming
Unit (CPU), by teams of consultants joined by DATU professional staff. Prior training in the preparation
of audits will be provided to the teams using the case of a pilot municipality. Local authorities and
populations will be involved in the decision making process. The CPU will be responsible for: (a)
allocating PIP resources to cities on the basis of population and current revenues; (b) selecting consultants
and Administration staff for the audits and making the necessary contractual arrangements; (c) mobilizing
the ad hoc external assistance deemed necessary; (d) laying the groundwork and monitoring audits in the
various cities, and seeing that the Municipality prepares project proposals in consultation with the
population; (e) supporting local authorities, especially for the development of PIPs and MAPs and signing
of the Municipal Contracts; (f) choosing the main contractors responsible for preparing detailed designs
and expediting procurement; (g) supervising the implementation of works and coordinating their
handover to the Municipalities; and (h) coordinating training activities under the component and helping
to promote it in the media. At the conclusion of Phase 1, at least 8 cities will have completed their audits.
Six of those will have signed their Municipal Contracts, at least two will have prepared bidding
documents, and 80% of the anticipated costs of the works will have been committed.
Costs
Total costs are estimated at US$ 3.7 million.

COMPONENT 3: INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING
Sub-component 1 - Support for improvement financing of priority services
Context and objectives
The main objective is to bring about lasting improvement in the mechanisms for financing solid waste
management and road maintenance, which constitute the two priority services in the City of Conakry.
Thus, the component aims to: (a) clarify the financial system of the City, which is the main entity
responsible for the satisfactory delivery of the above-mentioned priority urban services; (b) streamline the
fiscal chain for business and property taxes, which constitute the City's two main sources of revenue; (c)
establish financial management procedures better suited to the capacities of the City and its districts, in
order to ensure adequate resource allocations to the services deemed as having highest priority.
Risks identified at appraisal led to a decision to opt for staged implementation of certain activities
included in this sub-component: this refers to activities concerned with improving the fiscal chain of
command, for which the Government is expected, during the first year of Project implementation, to make
firrm commitments to mechanisms for estimating and sharing local tax revenues within the urban area of
Conakry. The Program's Phase 2 is subject to verification of Conakry's financing system. The main
elements of this effort, identified during preparation, can be stated as follows: (a) revision of the
arrangements governing the CFU in a manner more favorable to the City; (b) allocation of 50% of the
TUV (instead of 25%) to the City, and deposit of those revenues into a maintenance account; and (c)
revision of the mechanisms for imposing the business tax.
The finances of the City of Conakry and its five districts were the subject of in-depth studies during
project preparation. Aside from the inadequate financing available at these two levels, the following
important factors are: (a) the lack of clarity in the distribution of responsibilities and financing between
the Governorate and the districts; (b) the negative impact of the latest local fiscal measures (CFU and
TPU) on the Govemorate's finances; (c) the still poorly understood consequences of DNI's reorganization
in terms of local fiscal revenues; and (d) the need to strengthen accounting and financial management
skills at the Governorate level.
Content
The sub-component consists of two parts: a) improvement of the "fiscal chain"; and b) support for
improved financial management.
(a)  Improvement of the "fiscal chain." This part consists of a "fiscal census" of the city of Conakry
bearing on the CFU, business tax and TPU.  This census will be prepared in the first year; its
implementation would begin in Phase 1 - on a pilot basis - and would continue under Phase 2. The start-
up of pilot operations would be subject to the results obtained during preparation of the censuses; the
citywide expansion of the censuses during Phase 2 would also depend upon results obtained under the
pilot operations.



39
(i)  Preparation of the census
Develop a valuation grid3 based on housing types and rental surveys. The grid will be based
on a simple criteria. A more specific assessment of upscale properties can be envisaged;
Prepare the census: manual of procedures, survey forms,
Evaluate human and logistical needs: fiscal services, Project Unit, consultants,
*   Implementation arrangements: use adressage records, combine existing registries, produce
simplified building identification document from aerial photographs,
*   Consult on the implementation of the fiscal census.
(ii)  CFU census (Phase 1: pilot operation)
Computerize tax registry,
Merge existing databases (CFU, SEEG, SOGEL, SOTELGUI, etc.),
Define pilot census zones (e.g., Kaloum, Matam),
Execute census,
Acquire computer equipment for the relevant agencies (district centers and Real Estate
Division - on the basis of needs still unmet4) and training,
(iii) Business tax and TPU census
*   Update registry of business tax payers (based on adressage registry),
*   Acquire computer equipment for the relevant agencies (Service RNgional des Imp6ts de la
Ville - on the basis of needs still umnet5) and training,
(iv)   Outreach/promotional activities: develop various audiovisual aids (posters, radio
announcements, TV spots) based on experience gained under the Second Urban Project.
(b)   Support for improved financial management of the City of Conakry and its districts
This revolves around two types of intervention:
Urban, financial and organizational audits of the City of Conakry and its districts. These audits are
expected to generate: (1) recommendations for revision of the Ordinances of 1990 (attribution of
responsibilities, financial resources); (2) creation of new organizational charts, particularly for
services under the Governorate; (3) improved financial relations with the SPTD; and (4)
identification of the main ongoing and planned investment and maintenance operations. These
audits will be governed by specific terms of reference separate from those used for the secondary
cities (Component 2).
Training and studies: a training program based on lessons learned from the audits, and ad hoc
studies aimed at helping to meet the conditions for the Phase 2 start-up.
3 CFU: this is a calculation of the basis for taxation of residential and commercial properties. Particular care will be
taken to simplify arrangements for applying the CFU to ensure that the relevant services can manage this fiscal
process up to the time of actual receipt of the funds. Thus, the traditional methods of cadastral assessment requiring
property assessments will not be used, at least for most residential properties and for the more common types of
commercial property. Instead, a tax schedule based on objective and easily identifiable criteria will be used.
4The DNI issued a sizeable bidding invitation for the acquisition of computer equipment for several of its services;
the Third Urban Development Project will give priority to the equipping of services directly involved in managing
the CFU, the business tax and the TPU, for coverage of whatever equipment/services were not provided through this
procurement. Additional equipment may be provided under Phase 2 of the Third Urban Development Program.

Implementation
The sub-component will be carried out by the Project Unit, in close collaboration with DNI (for the fiscal
chain) and with the City and districts of Conakry (for the financial management of Conakry and its
districts). The financial analyst of the Project Unit will coordinate the various interventions. This
individual will work closely with the Programming Unit (CPU), especially to coordinate surveys and land
registry improvements and for the Conakry audit. The financial analyst will monitor implementation of
financial commitments made by the central govemment, Governorate and districts, i.e., mobilization of
counterpart funds and recurrent costs.

ANNEX 5 - COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS SUMMARY
for the Solid Waste Management Component
(costs are given in Guinean francs (GNF) and the base year is 1998)
Summary of costs and benefits
The economic costs and benefits of a solid waste program are always difficult to quantify due to the
intangible nature of benefits, such as health and quality of life. Job creation is an additional benefit of the
program. The cart system of garbage collection limits foreign exchange outflows due to the use of locally
produced equipment. Therefore, a comparison of the cost-effectiveness of various service delivery
options for collection and transfer to the landfill was undertaken. This analysis does not take into account
the costs of waste dumping at the landfill, and compares three waste management systems. These are: (i)
a system involving collection by carts, transfer to grouping points and the transfer, in one shift, of garbage
to the landfill in trucks bearing large-capacity (24m3) containers; (ii) the same system, using the same
type of truck, and two work shifts for transfer to the landfill; and (iii) a system involving the collection
and transfer of garbage to the landfill by trucks bearing containers with 7m3 capacity. The costs
identified are the costs of acquiring the trucks, carts, bins and containers, as well as construction costs for
the grouping points and operating expenses.
Main Assumptions
The main assumptions take into account the cost of various types of equipment and materiel (transfer
trucks valued at 260 million GNF, container trucks valued at 65 million GNF, containers with 24m3
capacity valued at 6 million GNF, containers with 7m3 capacity valued at 2.5 million GNF, carts at 0.4
million GNF, grouping points at 20 million GNF). The estimated amortization period for the trucks is 7
years and carts is 2 years. The average distance to the landfill is 15 km. Waste production is estimated at
0.5 kg per inhabitant per day with a density of 0.48. The analysis assumed waste production by a
population of 200,000. A work shift is 8 hours long and there are 312 working days per year.
Cost-effectiveness indicators
A comparison of costs indicates that the system consisting of collection with carts, grouping points,
transfer in two work shifts by trucks with 24m3 capacity has the lowest operating cost per ton (8,480
GNF), compared to the system using cart, a single daily work shift (at 9,955 GNF) and a truck with 7m3
capacity (10,663 GNF). The following table illustrates the costs of the various systems for each phase
and provides overall unit prices.

ANNEX 6 - FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
Institutional arrangements
A Project Unit will be established for the implementation of project activities. The Unit will include a
finance unit staffed with an Administrative and Financial Coordinator and an accountant responsible for
the project's financial management, including annual financial statements conforming to internationally
accepted accounting norms, and the certification of accounts by a qualified independent auditing firm
acceptable to IDA. The Unit will handle all project disbursements in accordance with IDA guidelines.
The project will be financed by IDA, the Government of Guinea, the Governorate (City of Conakry), the
five (5) Conakry districts, and the secondary cities affected by the project.
*  IDA will finance investments under each sub-component and a portion of the operating costs of the
operational units.
* The Government of Guinea will finance:
- 10% of the costs of works of the solid waste, primary roads and neighborhood upgrading
sub-components,
- 5% of local expenditures on equipment,
- 10% of the operating costs of the support for the operational units sub component, and
- the renewal of SPTD's materiel (establishment of a revolving fund with an annual
endowment equivalent to the depreciation of the materiel).
For the first year of the project, the mobilization of the counterpart funds will include (a) the availability
of US$115,000 representing the guarantee funds and (b) the initial deposit of US$100,000 before credit
effectiveness. The remaining counterpart funds will be allocated based on the needs of the project, with
disbursements based on a trimester calendar.
The Govemorate (City of Conakry) will finance:
- 75% of investments included in the PLIC under the "neighborhood upgrading" component,
and
- SPTD operating costs.
Funds for SPTD's operations will be made available to SPTD in an account opened in a commercial bank
in four quarterly installments, in February, June, September and November. A letter of agreement
between the city and the SPTD, defining the credit amounts as well as disbursement procedures, will be
written each year. Funds for neighborhood upgrading will be made available in two tranches (March and
June) and will be deposited on the secondary road maintenance account, which will be opened in a
commercial bank.
The districts of Conakry will:
- finance 25% of PLIC investments for neighborhood upgrading, and
-  participate in the financing of street cleaning in public areas.
PLIC funds will be made available to the "secondary roads" account in two tranches (March and June).
Street cleaning will be financed through an annual contribution from each district which will be made
available to SPTD in two tranches (March and June). A letter of agreement, between the districts and the
SPTD, will be written each year to define the credit amounts as well as disbursement procedures.



47
The secondary cities will contribute up to 5% of the cost of "financing of priority services" sub-
component (PIP).
The various accounts to be used to finance project activities are summarized here:

SPTD operating account          Capital endowment from          Director General SPTD + SAF
Governorate, districts of Conakry  SPTD
and SPTD's own resources.
Computerized accounting system
The Project Unit and SPTD will maintain separate accounts. A computerized accounting system,
including project accounting software and a procedures manual for administrative, financial and accounts
management and internal controls, will be set up for the Project Unit and SPTD by a qualified consultant.
The Project Unit's accounting system will: (a) maintain general accounts in Guinean francs in accordance
with international accounting norms; (b) monitor foreign exchange commitments; and (c) perform
analytical and budget monitoring of project expenditures by component, sub-component, disbursement
category and cost center. The software will be flexible, adaptable and Y2K compatible. SPTD will
maintain computerized accounts in accordance with its status as an Etablissement public administratif
(EPA). Prior to credit effectiveness, a World Bank specialist in financial management will evaluate the
accounting system set up for the Project Unit (appropriateness, skills of accounting personnel,
appropriateness of procedures, goals) to determine its ability to produce, in a timely manner, the needed
information on the project's resources and expenses.
Financial Reports
Project appraisal occurred before July 1, 1998, when the new Loan Administration Initiative (LACI)
requirements went into effect. However, the Project Unit's computerized accounting system will be
sufficiently flexible and adaptable to tailor the financial reports to LACI requirements. Reports produced
by the system will include general financial statements (balance sheets, resource and job charts, fixed
assets tables, etc.) as well as analytical and budgetary statements making it possible to monitor project
commitments and expenditures by component, sub-component and disbursement category in accordance
with the credit agreement. Subsequently, the system for producing financial reports will evolve from
traditional financial statements (mentioned above), which are to be produced during the first 18 months of
project implementation, toward the production of quarterly financial management reports conforming to
LACI requirements. The production of these new reports will begin toward the end of Phase 1 of the
project and will continue during Phase 2. An initial assessment will be done by IDA at the end of the first
year to determine whether it is appropriate to switch to the LACI system. A second assessment will occur
at the end of the third quarter of the second year of the project to prepare for the transition to LACI. All



48
procurement documents, contracts and invoices must be kept separately by the Project Unit and made
available to supervision missions and auditors.
Audits
The accounts of the Project Unit and SPTD will be annually audited by an independent and
internationally recognized auditing firm acceptable to IDA. In addition to an opinion on the project's
financial statements, the auditor will supply a separate opinion on (a) the certified statements of
expenditure; and (b) the management and use of the Special Account funds. The auditor will make an in-
depth review of the systems of internal controls to identify deficiencies and make recommendations for
improvement. The results of this review will be annotated in a separate report to be conveyed with the
audit reports. The Govemorate's accounts will also be reviewed by the auditor and a separate report will
be issued. Audit reports will be submitted to IDA no later than six months after the end of each fiscal
year.
The recruitment of the auditing firm, approval of the SPTD's procedures manual, creation of an
accounting procedures manual and computerized accounting system acceptable to IDA for the Project
Unit, are conditions of Credit effectiveness.
DISBURSEMENT
Allocation of funds under the credit
Credit funds are allocated as shown in the accompanying Table.
Use of statements of expenditure (SOEs)
Disbursements will be made against statements of expenditure (SOEs) for contracts for supplies, works
and consultants' services (consulting firms and individual consultants) and for training and operating
expenses not exceeding US$ 50,000 equivalent.  All supporting documentation concerning a
disbursement request against SOEs will be kept by the Project Unit and made available for perusal by
World Bank missions and external auditors. All disbursement requests relative to expenditures exceeding
the aforementioned threshold will be handled by direct payment.
Special Account
In order to ensure that funds needed for project implementation are available in a timely manner, a
Special Account, denominated in US dollars, will be opened at a commercial bank acceptable to IDA.
The amount deposited into the Special Account will be fixed at US$ 1,000,000. Funds may be withdrawn
from the Account after credit effectiveness. These funds represent the equivalent of about 3 months of
expenditures. An initial sum of US$ 500,000 will be deposited in the Special Account, until such time as
cumulative project expenditures have reached DTS 2,000,000. The Special Account will be replenished
each month, or as soon as the total disbursed from the account amounts to one third of the initial deposit.
Disbursement requests will be signed by the Coordinator of the Project Unit, through the delegated
authority of the Minister of Finance.

ANNEX 8 - PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS
1.  In general, Guinea's procurement laws and regulations do not conflict with IDA Guidelines. No
special exceptions, permits, or licenses need to be specified in the Credit documents for International
Competitive Bidding (ICB), since Guinea's procurement practices allow IDA procedures to take precedence
over any contrary provisions in local regulations. IDA-financed Works and Goods will be procured in
accordance with World Bank's Guidelines under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995, revised in
January and August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999). National Competitive Bidding (NCB),
advertised locally will be carried out in accordance with Guinea's procurement laws and regulations,
acceptable to IDA provided that: (a) any bidder is given sufficient time to submit bids (three to four weeks);
(b) bid evaluation and bidder qualification are clearly specified in bidding documents; (c) eligible firms are
not precluded from participation; (d) award will be made to the lowest evaluated bidder; and (e) prior to
issuing the first call for bids, draft standard bidding documents are submitted to IDA and found acceptable.
Consultant Services contracts financed by IDA will be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for
the Selection of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, published in January 1997 and revised in September
1997 and January 1999. The program elements by procurement methods are summarized below in Table A.
2.   Civil Works: Civil works contracts (infrastructure works) which cost less than US$ 500,000 per
contract up to an aggregate amount of US$ 5.0 million will be procured through NCB in accordance with
procedures described in the Manual of Procedures and acceptable to IDA. The bid announcement will be
published in local newspapers, informing potential interested bidders. Civil works contracts greater than
US$500,000, per contract up to an aggregate amount of $3.9 million will be procured through ICB. Small
works estimated to cost less than US$40,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$ 0.2 million, will
be procured under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three
qualified domestic contractors invited to bid. The invitation shall include an estimation of the works
established by an engineer/architect, a detailed description of the works, including basic specifications, the
required completion period, a basic form of agreement acceptable to IDA, and relevant drawings, where
applicable. The award would be made to the contractor who offers the lowest price quotation for the required
work, provided the contractor demonstrates the experience and resources required to successfully complete
the contract.
3.   Goods: Contracts for Goods financed by IDA, totaling US$ 1.5 million during the project life, will be
procured through ICB. Contracts for locally available vehicles and equipment, and materials which cost less
than US$200,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$ 0.60 million will be procured through NCB procedures
acceptable to IDA. Implementation of the program would require the purchase of relatively small, primarily
consumable items which would be difficult and impractical to package and procure, following NCB
procedures. Thus, such items (furniture and office equipment) which cannot be grouped into NCB packages
and cost less than US$30,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US150,000 over the
project life, could be procured through the national shopping.
4.   Consultant Services. Consulting services (technical audits, training, supervision of works and advisory
services) financed by IDA during the three years of the project will be procured in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants (January 1997, revised September 1997 and
January 1999). Selection between qualified short-listed firms will be based on Quality- and Cost-Based
Selection (QCBS). The quality of the proposal will be evaluated before weighing the quality and cost scores
and adding them. For audits of project accounts, the Least-Cost Selection will be the most appropriate
method, the firm with the lowest price will be selected, provided its technical proposal received the minimum
mark. Services for small studies which can be delivered by Individual Consultants will be selected through
comparison of qualifications among those expressing interest in the assignment or approached directly. Short-



54
lists for contracts estimated under US$100,000 may be comprised entirely of national consultants if a
sufficient number of qualified firms (at least three) are available at competitive costs. However, if foreign
firms express an interest in these contracts, they will not be excluded from consideration. The standard Letter
of Invitation and Form of Contract as developed by the Association will be used for appointment of
consultants. Simplified contracts will be used for short-term assignments, i.e. those not exceeding six months
and carried out by firms or individual consultants.
5.   IDA Reviews. IDA's prior review will be required for all goods and works contract valued at more
than US$ 200,000. IDA's prior review will also be required for consultant services contracts valued at more
than US$ 100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals Selective post-review of contracts awarded below
the threshold levels will apply to about one in three contracts. Bank staff will also review the selection
process for hiring consultants proposed by the Borrower. IDA's prior review will include the review of
budgets, short-lists, selection procedures, requests for proposals, evaluation reports and negotiated contracts.
The exception to prior IDA review will not apply to the Terms of Reference of such contracts, regardless of
their value, to single-source hiring, to assignments of a critical nature as determined by IDA, or to
amendments of contracts raising the contract value above the above-mentioned prior review thresholds. For
consultant contracts estimated above US$200,000, opening financial envelopes will not take place prior to
receiving IDA's no-objection to the technical evaluation.  For contracts estimated to cost less than
US$200,000 and more than US$ 100,000, the borrower will notify IDA of the results of the technical
evaluation prior to opening the financial proposals. Documents related to procurement below the prior review
thresholds will be maintained by the borrowers for ex-post review by auditors and by IDA supervision
missions.
6.   Capacity assessment and proposed procurement arrangements: Procurement practices were slow under
the previous IDA financed projects. However, national bidding procedures for public sector procurement in
Guinea have recently improved. A revised procurement code was issued in June 1997. The introduction of
simplified procedures and staff training supported under an IDF Grant have also improved the current
situation. Previous experience with UDP2, however, shows that contract signature was taking too much time
(up to 8 months after contract award). During negotiations, the thresholds and simplified procurement
procedures for small contracts between US$150,000 and US$300,000 were accepted and will be included in
the Manual of Execution of the project.
7.   During negotiations: (a) an agreement was reached for the preparation of a procurement plan for the
first year of the program which will be annexed to the Manual of Execution of the Project; and (b) the
Government agreed to submit (i) a draft Operational Manual for Program Management and Implementation,
including target time periods for the various procurement phases, and (ii) standard bidding documents to be
used under NCB procedures for civil works and goods. During negotiations, agreement was reached on the
proper monitoring of procurement. The Government gave assurance at negotiations that it will: (a) use the
Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for ICB and Standard Bid Evaluation reports; (b) apply the procurement
procedures and arrangements outlined in the above documents; and (c) review the procurement plan and
procurement arrangements each year at the annual review with IDA. During implementation, all bidding
documents, bid evaluation reports, and draft contracts transmitted to IDA for review will contain an updated
copy of the procurement plan. Procurement information will be collected and recorded as follows:
(a) prompt recording of contract award information by the Borrower; and
(b) semi-annual reports to the Association by the Borrower indicating: (i) revised cost estimates
for individual contracts and the total program, including best estimates of allowances for
contingencies; (ii) revised timing of estimated procurement actions, including experience
with completion time and complete costs for individual contracts; and (iii) compliance with
aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement.



55
During negotiations, the Government confirmed its agreement on (i) preparing annual technical audit reports,
acceptable in form and substance to IDA, and (ii) progress reports based on time-bond performance
indicators three months before each annual review.
The Government also gave assurance at negotiations that it will take the necessary measures to ensure that
procurement phases do not exceed the following target time periods:
Procurement Phases                          Maximum Number of weeks
* Preparation of bidding documents          4 (12 for large contracts)
* Preparation of bids by bidders            4 (6 -10 for ICB)
* Bid evaluation                            2 (4 for large contracts)
* Signature of contract                     2
* Payments                                  3

ANNEX 9 - LETTER OF SECTOR POLICY
DECLARATION OF URBAN POLICY
Republic of Guinea
A. Background
1.   Since the establishment of the Second Republic in 1984, Guinea has made great strides in
economic and financial administration as well as in urban planning and management.
2.   Taking up its traditional mandate once again, the Government has emphasized, over the last two
decades, national policies and strategies, development of national skills, creation of an efficient and more
credible administration, and a program of priority infrastructure in support of directly productive sectors.
3.   Economic and financial reforms have created the climate needed for sustainable growth through
market liberalization, the creation of a regulatory framework appropriate to a market economy, and
restoration of a balanced macroeconomic picture. Inflation has been reduced from 72% in 1987 to 4% in
1997, the Government's budget deficit fell from 9.8% of GDP in 1986 to 7.2% in 1996, and the current
accounts deficit dropped from 13.4% in 1988 to 8.8% in 1995. Economic growth caused GDP to grow at
a rate of 4% per year until 1996 and about 6% per year subsequently.
4.   In a parallel development, decentralization was initiated in 1986 and manifested at the urban level
through the creation in 1990 of urban districts, or communes. There are now 38 urban districts, 5 of
which are in Conakry, grouped together into an intermediate administrative echelon comprising the City
of Conakry. These districts are characterized by their low level of planning and managerial capacity and
by the precariousness of their financial resources.
5.   In an economic context characterized by scarce financial resources, the creation of urban districts
has already fostered a more targeted management of urban centers and sustainable provision of high-
quality basic services. Local populations, most notably through associations, participate directly in
financing local priority investments.
6.   These reforms have profoundly affected town and regional planning. One should note in particular
that the sectoral administration has been completely restructured, its technical and managerial capacities
improved, and that a new legislative and regulatory framework, including Land Tenure and Land Registry
Codes and an Urban Planning Code, has been established. These initiatives have generated greater
knowledge of urban issues and made it possible to introduce appropriate managerial tools.
B. Issues in the urban sector
7.   Guinea is undergoing rapid urbanization. The urban population living in settlements of over 5,000
inhabitants numbered 450,000 in 1960 (14% of the population) and 2.4 million in 1996 (40% of the
population). Conakry, the country's political capital, main economic hub and port city, is home to over
50% of the urban population and possesses 50% of all jobs. Government administration and public
services are represented in the same proportions.
8.   The country has about 40 urban centers with more than 5,000 inhabitants. Overall, the nationwide
spatial distribution of these towns appears satisfactory, since they are separated by an average distance of



62
130 km. Great disparities exist among them, however. Kankan, the second largest city in the country, has
fewer than 150,000 habitants, followed by Kindia, Labe, N'Zerekore, Kissidougou and Kamsar with
populations of about 100,000. These towns have developed without master plans, causing great damage
to land resources and the environment.
9.   Guinean cities are characterized by weak and dilapidated infrastructure and facilities, since
investment has been sparse in the sector. Most urban road networks were either refurbished or built
during the 1960s (this applies mainly to Conakry, Kindia, Mamou, Labe and Kankan) and have not been
regularly maintained. Apart from recent construction, these roadways are in poor condition and rainwater
drainage systems in ruins. Many community and commercial facilities are in an advanced state of decay.
10.  Basic urban services are still provided to only a few. New neighborhoods that are isolated and
underequipped account for much of the surface area of cities. Urban transportation is scarce and
inefficient. The collection of household garbage is organized only in Conakry (80% collection rate) and
in Labe (in the city center). Wastewater collection exists only in the center of Conakry and is
accomplished by a 25 km long sewer system, which is currently being refurbished.
11.  The rate of growth of these urban centers is about 6%, including births and rural-urban migration.
It is estimated that 40% of the urban population lives below the poverty threshold. This poor population
generally lives in inaccessible neighborhoods where basic urban services are rarely available.
12.  Decentralization has allowed urban districts and local populations to become progressively more
involved in the quest for solutions to urban problems. However, the absence of city master plans and the
lack of clear definitions of district-level responsibilities in the area of urban planning greatly reduce the
scope for local intervention.
13.  Despite efforts made since 1984, development indicators in the urban sector are still weak. This is
due to the sector's considerable lag, and points out the need to increase the resources brought for its
development.
C. Sector development strategy
14.  Urban development improves the living conditions of the population and spurs an endogenous
development dynamic in urban centers. Because of its impact on the quality of life, the Government
decided in 1998 to include the urban sector among its national priorities (the so-called CDMT sectors)
and to earmark more resources than in the past. In order to translate these options into action, sectoral
policy will be implemented in three strategic areas.
a) Control over urban development and greater local involvement
15. In this area, the Government is maintaining its basic options set out in the national land planning
scheme (SNAT - Schema National d'Amenagement du Territoire) in 1991. The SNAT essentially
proposes that the national territory be subdivided into 9 regions to be equipped and identifies the urban
functions to be developed. Its implementation will take the form of a coherent distribution of investments
with a view to balanced regional development.
16.  Judicious application of the SNAT requires that city master plans be developed and implemented.
About ten cities, including Conakry and the regional capitals, have either master plans or a preliminary
development plan, prepared toward the end of the 1980s. The Government will continue to draw up these
schemas, emphasizing the selection of priority investments and good governance programs. The



63
Government's investment program will emphasize priority infrastructure with immediate impact upon the
population's quality of life.
17.  Urban districts (communes) will be closely involved in the preparation of their master plans by
means of "urban and financial audits." This form of intervention takes into account not only the
population's priority needs, but also the sharing and/or transfer of responsibilities as the investment
programs are carried out, and the assumption by local populations of recurrent maintenance costs.
b) Provision of basic urban services
18.  Urban services are an important quality-of-life indicator. With this in mind, the Government will
continue its efforts to improve urban service provision in general, especially drinking water supply,
electricity, urban transport, household garbage removal, wastewater purification, rainwater drainage, etc.
19.  Services of strictly local relevance (e.g., household garbage management and maintenance of non-
primary roads) will be handled under the works oversight of the municipalities. The Government will
take the required institutional, technical, financial and regulatory measures to improve local capabilities in
planning, programming and managing these urban services.
20.  The Government and districts will pursue efficient management of urban services and will envisage
modes of implementation involving the private sector. Proceeding in this manner will enable them to
simultaneously manage a larger volume of works or services than is possible under force account, and
under better conditions in terms of transparency and cost.
21. The Government and local collectivities will work to coordinate their efforts to improve access to
urban extension zones, as a necessary condition of improved and sustainable services.
c) Institutional and regulatory measures
22.  The sectoral strategy's institutional and regulatory dimension will ensure that activities are
implemented under acceptable conditions of management, cost and timeframe. It will affect all actors
involved in such activities: Government, local collectivities, private sector, associative entities and NGOs.
23. The Government will create or update, as needed, the legislative and regulatory texts necessary to
apply the strategy in areas a) and b). These texts will address the responsibilities of local collectivities in
the area of urban planning and housing, procurement rules and procedures, private sector involvement,
and the financing of sectoral development activities.
24.  The specific responsibilities of urban districts with regard to city planning and housing will be
detailed in a policy document that will serve as a guide for local intervention. This document will be
collaboratively drawn up by the Government and the districts.
25.  With a view to greater control over the costs of its projects and those of the districts, the
Government will continue to simplify procedures and reduce public procurement delays, and establish
procurement procedures appropriate to local collectivities.
26. It has been established that private sector involvement leads to great gains in productivity as well
as in service quality and reliability. The Government, which has already seen this demonstrated in
various areas, will encourage management schemes that involve the private sector.



64
27.  Given its positive experience with solid waste management, the Government will support all
solutions involving diversification of the modes of urban services financing, especially if they rely on the
resources of local collectivities and beneficiary populations.  These mechanisms for diversifying
financing are only operational and efficient in the context of an institutional set-up based upon the private
sector.
D. Support for implementation of the sectoral strategy
28.  The Ministry of Urban Planning and Housing (Ministere de l'Urbanisme et de 1'Habitat) is the
entity responsible for urban strategy, the implementation of which requires the help of the donor
community.
29.  Various donors have contributed to Guinea's urban strategy. The main ones are the World Bank,
the Agence FranQaise de Developpement, the UNDP, the European Fund, the GREA, the Russian
Republic, the KfW and the ADB. Their interventions have provided the country with the primary tools of
urban planning (SNAT, master plans, housing policy), improved the sectors technical and managerial
capacities and carried out a sizable program of priority infrastructure.
30.  The World Bank financed the First and Second Urban Projects (1985-1998) which resulted in: (i)
the creation of a master plan for the City of Conakry; (ii) the provision of priority infrastructure and
facilities for Conakry and four regional capitals; (iii) improved urban services in Conakry, such as waste
management and secondary roads maintenance; (iv) improved mobilization of local resources; and (v)
experimented in housing policy, through the diversification of parties involved in the development of
urban land (e.g., Soloprimo and the Governorate as developers, alongside DATU).
31. The Government has asked for the World Bank's help in carrying out a Third Urban Development
Project which is the continuation of the preceding projects and systematizes their objectives. Since it
benefits from past experience, the approach used under this project is more coherent and fosters a
powerful synergy among its various components. Its main objectives are: (i) to improve living conditions
for the population of Conakry by providing basic services; (ii) to create an enabling environment for the
programming, financing and management of a set of priority investments in secondary cities; and (iii) to
alleviate poverty by promoting the private sector and using labor-intensive technologies.

Although the project was initially identified in 1993, a decision was made in 1994 (UDP2 mid-term
review of January 1994) to refocus the Bank's efforts on UDP2. Preparation of UDP3 was resumed in
1995. Priority was always given to complete UDP2 before launching UDP3.
