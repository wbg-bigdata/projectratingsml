                        Description of the Project
    The objectives of the Project are to: (a) set the stage for a gradual
and orderly privatization of the power sector in general and WAPDA in
particular; (b) support WAPDA's least cost power investment program so as
to minimize the country's chronic power shortage and to facilitate the
privatization process; (c) enhance the resource mobilization capability and
operational efficiency, autonomy and accountability of power sector
entities; and (d) strengthen the environmental assessment and mitigation
capabilities within the power sector.
    The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such
modifications thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon from time
to time to achieve such objectives:
Part A:   Restructuring and Privatization Program
    Implementation of the Strategic Plan through:
    (1)   the reorganization and corporatization of WAPDA into a holding
          company with decentralized generation, transmission and
          distribution subsidiaries;
    (2)   the establishment of NEPRA to set standards for and regulate a
          gradually privatized power sector;
    (3)   the definition and adoption of a power tariff policy and tariff
          administration system consistent with the efficient operation and
          the privatization objectives of the sector;
    (4)   the development of a manpower transition program to address the
          concerns of WAPDA's labor and staff arising from WAPDA's gradual
          passage into the private sector; and
    (5)   the initial offering of selected assets of WAPDA for acquisition
          by the private sector.
Part B:   Investment Program
    Implementation of a four-year time-slice (FY 95-98) of the Investment
Program, such as would, inter alia, improve the reliability of the power
sector so as to make it attractive to the private sector, through:
    (1)   the expansion of generation facilities, including the completion
          of certain on-going, and the construction of new, thermal and
          hydel projects;
    (2)   the expansion and reinforcement of the transmission system,
          including the completion of on-going, and the construction of new,
          EHV and STG lines and grid-station projects;
    (3)   the expansion, reinforcement and rehabilitation of the
          distribution system, including the construction of MV and LV
Page  10
          lines, the installation of new transformers and the provision of
          new service drops for LV line customers; and
    (4)   the expansion and reinforcement of the rural electrification
          system, including the construction of MV and LV lines.
Part C:   Technical Assistance and Training
1.  Carrying out for WAPDA of: (a) a distribution diagnostic study of one
WAPDA AEB; (b) a sectoral environmental assessment study; (c) a management
information systems (MIS) implementation program; and (d) a financial
resource mobilization study.
2.  Strengthening of WAPDA's training programs through the provision of
special expertise and equipment and materials for: (a) the engineering and
generation training academies; (b) the switch-gear workshop; and (c) hot-
line maintenance especially for the 220 and 132 kV (kilovolt) lines.

Agreement;
    (b)   the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in respect of

2.  Payments out of the Special Accounts shall be made exclusively for
eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.
3.  After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that a Special
Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the relevant Authorized
Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall
be made as follows:
    (a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower or
WAPDA, as the case may be, shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests
for a deposit or deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the
Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the Bank
shall, on behalf of the Borrower or WAPDA, as the case may be, withdraw from
the Loan Account and deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts
as the Borrower or WAPDA, as the case may be, shall have requested.
    (b)   (i)   For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower or
                WAPDA, as the case may be, shall furnish to the Bank
                requests for deposits into the Special Account at such
Page  12
                intervals as the Bank shall specify.
         (ii)   Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower
                or WAPDA, as the case may be, shall furnish to the Bank the
                documents and other evidence required pursuant to para-
                graph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or payments in
                respect of which replenishment is requested. On the basis
                of each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
                Borrower or WAPDA, as the case may be, withdraw from the
                Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account such
                amount as the Borrower or WAPDA, as the case may be, shall
                have requested and as shall have been shown by said
                documents and other evidence to have been paid out of the
                Special Account for eligible expenditures.
All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under
the respective eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent
amounts, as shall have been justified by said documents and other evidence.
4.  For each payment made by the Borrower or WAPDA, as the case may be, out
of a Special Account, the Borrower or WAPDA, as the case may be, shall, at
such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such
documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively
for eligible expenditures.
5.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank
shall not be required to make further deposits into a Special Account:
    (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower or WAPDA, as the case may be,
directly from the Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article
V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this
Agreement; or
    (b)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the
eligible Categories for Parts A(2) and A(3) of the Project in case of the
Borrower or for Parts A(1), A(4), A(5) and B of the Project in the case of
WAPDA, less the amount of any outstanding special commitment entered into
by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect
to Parts A(2) and A(3) of the Project in the case of the Borrower or for
Parts A(1), A(4), A(5) and B of the Project in the case of WAPDA, shall
equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the relevant Authorized
Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn
amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories for Parts A(2) and
A(3) of the Project in the case of the Borrower or for Parts A(1), A(4),
A(5) and B of the Project in case of WAPDA shall follow such procedures as
the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower or WAPDA, as the case may
be. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that
the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on
deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be
utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.
6.  (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out
of a Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not
eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified
by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower or WAPDA, as the case
may be, shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such
additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the Special
Account (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount
equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible
or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by
the Bank into the Special Account shall be made until the Borrower or WAPDA,
as the case may be, has provided such evidence or made such deposit or
refund, as the case may be.
    (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount
outstanding in a Special Account will not be required to cover further
payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower or WAPDA, as the case may
be, shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such
outstanding amount.
Page  13
    (c)   The Borrower or WAPDA, as the case may be, may, upon notice to the
Bank, refund to the Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in a
Special Account.
    (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c)
of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent
withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions
of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
