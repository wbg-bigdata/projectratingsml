3. Program Description

3.a. Description of program

1.      The decade of the 1990s in Pakistan witnessed a decline in per capita growth to 1.2
percent per year from 3 percent per year in the 1980s, an increase in poverty, and stagnation in
social indicators. The military government that came to power in 1999 initiated wide-ranging
reforms aimed at stabilizing and reviving the economy.                        These included improving fiscal
balances, privatizing public sector enterprises, reforming the banking sector, and taking steps to
strengthen public and corporate governance. These reforms have continued under the elected
government, in power since 2002.

2.      Pakistan's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), entitled "Accelerating Economic
Growth and Reducing Poverty: The Road Ahead", was completed on December 31, 2003, and is
a comprehensive strategy for addressing poverty in its various dimensions.1 It emphasizes
policies to sustain rapid growth as the main vehicle for poverty reduction and is grounded on
four pillars: (i) achieving sustained high and broad-based economic growth, focusing particularly
on the rural economy, while maintaining macroeconomic stability; (ii) improving governance
and consolidating devolution, both as a means of delivering better development results and
ensuring social and economic justice; (iii) investing in human capital, with a renewed emphasis
on effective delivery of basic social services; and (iv) targeting the poor and vulnerable, to bring
the marginalized sections of the population and backward regions into the mainstream of
development, and to make marked progress in reducing existing inequalities.

3.      The Government is planning to draft a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper Progress Report
over the next two months. This document is expected to review progress in policy
implementation and economic outcomes, as well as update the status of key economic and social
indicators, drawing on new data sources, such as the Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire
(CWIQ), expected to become available in shortly. The Government has also prepared a Medium

Term Development Framework, a five-year plan outlining the federal public sector investments
required to meet the growth and poverty reduction objectives outlined in the PRSP.

3.b. Description of operation

4.      As envisioned in the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy, discussed by the Board on June
11, 2002, the PRSC I was the first of a series of three proposed operations that would support the
implementation of the Government of Pakistan's reform program as laid out in its PRSP. PRSC
I, in an amount of $300 million, was disbursed in September 2004. The Bank is currently in
advanced preparation of PRSC II, which is planned to be presented before the Board during the
second quarter of 2005/06. PRSC I drew on the lessons learnt under previous programmatic
operations, in particular Structural Adjustment Credit 1 and Structural Adjustment Credit 2. The
program was also informed by a number of Bank analytical reports covering areas such as oil
and gas, power, public expenditure management, financial management, procurement,
devolution, and rural factor markets.

5.      PRSC I was closely aligned with the four reform pillars outlined in the PRSP. As
Pakistan's poor growth performance was at the root of the increase in poverty incidence over the
1990s, the main thrust of the PRSP and the PRSC program is on a set of policies to sustain rapid
growth. Within this broad PRSP agenda, and given that many of the responsibilities for
improving service delivery in education, health, and water and sanitation rest with provincial and
local governments, the program also focused on critical policy and institutional reforms that are
in the domain of the federal government. The operation also launched analytical work to
strengthen safety nets. The operation focused primarily on reforms to accelerate growth, on
measures to improve procurement and financial management, and to provide a national policy
framework and incentive structure for accelerating poverty reduction and improvements in
education and health. The first year of the PRSC program overlapped with and complemented
the last year of implementation of the macro stabilization program supported by the IMF with a
Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF).

4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs

6.      The achievement of the objectives and outcomes is rated as satisfactory. Pakistan's
overall macroeconomic and growth performance have been strong, and reforms in a number of
areas, such as privatization, tax administration reforms, and telecommunications deregulation
have progressed well. In other areas, notably power sector, and in civil service reforms, progress
has been much slower, and these are among the focal areas of the dialogue under PRSC II.

7.      The following provides an assessment of achievement of objectives and outputs for each
of the prior actions of PRSC I (given in bold in Annex 1), as well as outcomes of the broader
reforms supported under the program.

Outcomes of PRSC I Prior Actions

8.      Macroeconomic stability: highly satisfactory.       The maintenance of macroeconomic
stability was a prior action of PRSC I. Pakistan's macroeconomic performance over the past two
years has been impressive (Table 1). In 2002/03 GDP growth at factor cost was 5.1 percent,


                                                    3

which increased to 6.4 percent by 2003/04, and is projected to increase by 8.4 percent in
2004/05. Growth in the past year has been broad based, with the Agriculture, Industry, and
Services sector increasing by 7.5 percent, 10.2 percent, and 7.9 percent respectively. The fiscal
deficit (excluding grants) decreased from 3.7 percent of GDP in 2002/03 to 2.4 percent by
2003/04, and is projected to be 3.2 percent for 2004/05.2 While the freezing of retail petroleum
prices from May 2004 to December 2004, and again from March 2005 onwards, had a significant
impact on collections of the Petroleum Development Levy, tax and non-tax revenues have been
higher than targeted. The ninth and final review of the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) was completed in December 2004. Performance under the PRGF has been
strong, at times exceeding expectations with respect to quantitative performance criteria. One
area of concern is inflation, which, fuelled by a combination of rising food prices, and a strong
growth in private sector credit over the past year, increased to 9.3 percent (year-on-year) for the
period July-May of 2004-05, and will surpass the revised target of 7 percent for the year.

9.         Fiscal policy: satisfactory. Cabinet approval and submission to the National Assembly
of the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Bill was a prior action for PRSC I. The Bill
aims to lock in the gains made in fiscal and debt management over the past four years, through
the reduction of the revenue deficit to zero by June 30, 2008 and the maintenance of a surplus
thereafter; a reduction in the total debt to 60 percent of GDP or lower by June 2013; and
protection of PRSP expenditures. The National Assembly passed the Bill in March 2005, the

2    Pakistan's Federal Bureau of Statistics completed in May 2004 a comprehensive revision of the national accounts statistics.
     The base year was moved from 1980/81 to 1999/00 and several new sectors of economic activity were included. The results
     of this revision are a nominal GDP for 1999/00 and subsequent years that are about 20 percent higher than previously
     estimated levels. This ICR uses the "new" GDP series.



                                                                              4

Senate approved it in June 2005, and it is expected to be passed into Law after the assent of the
President.

10.      Power sector: less than satisfactory. Reform of the power sector remains a critical
priority both for accelerating growth and reducing the sector's drain on the budget. The
Government in April 2004 approved an Action Plan (a PRSC I prior action), aimed at improving
the financial viability of the sector through better governance, reduced costs, rationalized tariffs,
and more targeted and transparent subsidies. Implementation of the action plan has proceeded
over the past year with mixed success. The government established a Policy Implementation
Cell in the Ministry of Water and Power to coordinate and manage the reform effort, notified
subsidy and tariff policies, and notified the individual generation and transmission entity tariffs.
The successful bidding in February 2005, of Karachi Electric Supply Corporation, and the IPO,
in March 2005, of 20 percent shares of Kot Addu Power Company (with this IPO, 56 percent of
Kot Addu shares are in private hands) were major achievements. Less progress has been
achieved in the other key areas of the Plan ­ on corporate governance, revenue enhancement,
cost minimization, corporatization, private sector participation and capacity building ­ in large
part due to the delay in the notification of the tariffs for the unbundled entities.

11.      Telecommunications: highly satisfactory.                   Pakistan has made rapid strides in de-
regulating the fixed line market, and in increasing competition in the mobile segment.3 The
government approved a fixed line policy on January 2004 (a PRSC I prior action), with the
objective increasing customer choice, promoting infrastructure development through increased
private investment and competition and increasing rural access. As a result of this policy, 12
new Long Distance International (LDI), and 84 new Local Loop (LL) licenses have been
awarded by the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA). These new companies are
presently in the process of operationalizing their services. The new mobile policy (a PRSC I
prior action) opens the way for increased competition in the sector, and under it two additional
licenses were issued to two foreign companies in April 2004, thus increasing the total number of
mobile operators in the country to six. The successful bidding for the strategic sale of 26 percent
shares of Pakistan Telecommunications Company (PTCL) took place on June 18, 2005, the
largest such transaction in Pakistan's history.

12.      Deregulation has had a positive impact in terms of growth and reduction in costs.
Growth of the mobile sector has been impressive, with the number of mobile connections
increasing from approximately 3.5 million in 2003 to approximately 8.5 million by end 2004.
Tariffs have been reduced, with free roaming introduced by many of the mobile operators, and
reduction in activation charges. Overall teledensity (fixed and mobile) has increased from 4.3
per 100 in 2002/03 to 8.5 per 100 by end December 2004.

13.      Procurement: less than satisfactory. Procurement reform had been on the agenda of the
government for close to a decade, but with little substantive progress. Therefore, the notification
(in June 2004) of new procurement rules (a PRSC I prior action), conforming to international
best practice, by the Pakistan Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) was a significant
achievement.      These rules apply to all procurement of goods carried out by the federal


3   The World Bank provided technical assistance to the Government for establishing a regulatory framework for the
    telecommunications sector



                                                              5

government line departments, as well as those of state-owned enterprises and semi-autonomous
organizations.

14.     Progress has slowed however, since the notification of these rules. Some key pending
follow-up measures include the notification of supporting implementing regulations (these have
been drafted, but are awaiting approval by the PPRA board); the development of a monitoring
and reporting mechanism; and the creation of second tier appeals procedure, which would allow
aggrieved bidders recourse to a body other than the implementation agency for the redressal of
their grievances.

15.     Financial management: satisfactory.                   The government's reform program in public
financial management has advanced in a number of key areas. The Controller General of
Accounts (CGA) organization has been strengthened, and the timeliness of reporting and
reliability of public accounts and audit reports has improved substantially. Under the Bank-
funded Project for Improved Financial Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA), a new computerized
accounting system and a new chart of accounts is being developed, although progress in
computerizing the sites has been slow.                      Legislative oversight has improved with the
establishment of Public Accounts Committees at the federal level (a PRSC I prior action), as well
as in the provinces. The federal Public Accounts Committee has made good progress in
reviewing audit reports, and in tracking and monitoring cash recoveries from public officials in
government departments and other public institutions.                        Less progress however, has been
achieved in clearing backlogs of audit reports and audited accounts, due in large part to the
poorer quality of the older audit reports that resulted in a large number of audit paragraphs being
placed before the Committee. In addition, and subsequent to PRSC I approval, there has been a
decline in some provinces in the accuracy of financial reporting (a PRSC I prior action), in
particular due to problems in reconciling district accounts.

16.     Investing in Human Capital: satisfactory. The government recognizes that Pakistan's
social indicators lag well behind those of countries at comparable levels of income. Low public
expenditures on health and education, either expressed in per capita terms or as a share of GDP,
have been one important factor behind Pakistan's poor performance, and the PRSP targets
significant increases in education, health, water and sanitation and other key sectoral
expenditures. PRSC I prior actions specified increased consolidated budgetary allocations in
education and health (to at least 2 percent and 0.7 percent of GDP respectively).4 Progress on
the actual utilization of these allocations has been mixed. Consolidated education expenditures
increased to 2.16 percent of GDP (old) in 2003-04, but health expenditures, at 0.59 percent of
GDP (old), fell short of the budgetary allocation.

17.     Improving the effectiveness of these expenditures is equally important for improving
outcomes. The actual delivery of public services in these sectors rests with provincial and local
governments, and preliminary results suggest that provincial incentive programs such as the
provision of free textbooks, and stipends for girls are producing notable results, particularly in



4   These PRSC I prior actions were based on the "old" GDP series. As per the new series, the targets for education and health
    would be 1.67 percent and 0.58 percent of GDP respectively




                                                               6

Punjab.5 The federal government also has a key role to play in policy formulation, increasing
and diversifying the number of service providers, monitoring and evaluation, and in piloting
innovations that can then be replicated and scaled up by provincial and local governments. One
important area that affects quality of education is the assessment of student learning
achievement, and the government has launched the National Education Assessment System (a
PRSC I prior action), which is a sample-based national assessment of student learning, with
standardized tests conducted at grade 4 and grade 8 levels. The pilot testing of Grade 4 students in
Language and Mathematics was conducted throughout the country in April 2004. This is the first time
in Pakistan that a national and cross-provincial baseline of student achievement is being
measured against the national curricula. In order to improve the quality of teaching, the
government is also in the process of developing minimum standards for assessing teacher
competencies.

18.     In health, the government has engaged in public-private partnerships to expand the
provision of preventive and curative services in TB DOTS, Malaria and HIV/AIDS services (a
PRSC I prior action). Contracts have been signed with 12 NGOs, and service delivery has
commenced from the fourth quarter of 2004. A set of monitoring indicators and a monitoring
mechanism are being put in place including third party assessment of service quality and outputs.
The services through these NGO contracts are expected to provide access to TB DOTS to about
10 million population; provide insecticide treated bed nets and prompt diagnosis and malaria
treatment services to about 7-8 million in 23 high risk districts; and voluntary counseling and
testing services through 16 centers in 14 cities.

Outcomes of the Broader Reform Program Supported Under PRSC I

19.     Fiscal policy: Pakistan's tax-to-GDP ratio is low in comparison to similar developing
countries, in part due to the narrow coverage of buoyant taxes, such as the GST, and limited
coverage of agriculture, but also due to weaknesses in tax administration. The reform of the
Central Board of Revenue (CBR) is a priority for the government, and is being supported by the
World Bank's Tax Administration Reform Project. A system of Universal Self Assessment with
risk-based audit was introduced in 2002, to minimize taxpayers' interaction with tax officials,
and therefore to change the culture of extortion that has characterized tax collection in Pakistan.
CBR is being reorganized along functional lines, along with changes in human resource
management, and to this effect Large Taxpayer Units have been established in Karachi and
Lahore, and Medium Taxpayer Units (MTUs) have been set up in Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar,
and Rawalpindi. These MTUs will become part of 12 regional tax offices, expected to be
established by December 2005, which will co-locate sales tax and income tax, providing for
greater sharing of information and removing of duplication.

20.     Privatization: Pakistan's privatization program has continued to advance at a good pace
during the last two years. Despite a difficult international environment, the program made
headway by targeting domestic investors for smaller transactions, by disinvesting government
shares in state owned companies through the stock markets, and through large strategic
transactions and management transfers. Key transactions include the sale of United Bank

Limited (in October 2002); Habib Bank (in January 2004); the bidding for 76 percent share and
management control of Karachi Electric Supply Corporation (in February 2005); the bidding for
51 percent share and management control of National Refinery Limited (in May 2005); and the
bidding for 26 percent share and management control of Pakistan Telecommunications Company
(in June 2005). In addition, a number of transactions are at an advanced stage and are expected
to be completed over the next six months, including Pakistan State Oil, and Pakistan Petroleum
Limited.

21.     Oil and gas: In addition to its fiscal repercussions, the freezing of retail petroleum prices
also had a negative impact on the cash flows of oil marketing companies. Natural gas wellhead
and consumer prices have been adjusted on July 1, 2004 and January 2005, based on fluctuations
in international oil prices, and in accordance with the determination of the Oil & Gas Regulatory
Authority (OGRA). While this enables the sector to remain financially solvent, there has been
no progress on restructuring the first slab for household consumers, or in making the subsidy to
the fertilizer industry transparent and through the Budget.

22.     Civil service reform: The Government recognizes the importance of improving the
quality of the civil service in order to increase the effectiveness of its poverty reduction programs
and to improve service delivery. Supported by the World Bank Public Sector Capacity Building
Project, the government is making good progress in providing technical training to its middle and
senior level officers. However, progress in civil service restructuring has been slow. While a
broad civil service reform strategy was formulated, and a Civil Service Reform Unit (CSRU)
created (in November 2003) to manage and oversee the reform process, there has been little
concrete follow-up action on the plan to create an elite National Executive Service, or on the
creation of a District Service to further devolution. Progress on pay and pensions reform has
also been limited. A Pay and Pensions Committee was constituted in 2004 to examine
compensation reforms for civil servants to create better incentives for recruitment and retention,
to remove a number of distortions and inequities in the pensions system, as well as to reduce the
unfunded financial liability to the government. The Bank provided technical assistance to the
Committee, which presented its recommendations to the government in May 2005. However, a
preliminary assessment of the measures announced in the 2005/06 budget suggests that the
Government decided against adopting the main reforms recommended by the Committee.


23.      Targeting the Poor and the Vulnerable: While the Government's poverty reduction
strategy relies on rapid, broad-based growth as the most effective way to accelerate poverty
reduction, targeted programs aimed at addressing poverty and vulnerability directly are also an
important component of the government's PRSP. Pakistan has a number of government and
non-government programs targeted to the poor and the destitute, such as income support
programs like Zakat and the Food Support Program, micro-finance facilities, such as the Pakistan
Poverty Alleviation Fund, and public works programs like the Khushal Pakistan Program. To
date, a majority of these have been significantly under-funded, and there has been no rigorous
analysis of their coverage, impact and effectiveness in targeting. In order to improve targeting,
coverage, and the administration of these programs the government, with Bank technical
assistance, is presently conducting a comprehensive evaluation of its safety net programs. This
is the first such evaluation of its kind in Pakistan. The government has also recognized that the
poverty alleviation effectiveness of the safety nets programs will remain well below its potential,



                                                      8

as long as the key determinants of poverty--including poor health, high fertility, and lack of
education--are not systematically addressed. To this end, the government is in the process of
developing pilots for conditional cash transfer (CCT) interventions to improve the utilization of
TB DOTS services, as well as to improve primary school enrollments of children in poor
families.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

24.    Political factors were the major reason why outcomes were less than satisfactory in
certain sectors, such as power, civil service reforms, and oil and gas.          For example, the
implementation of a regionally differentiated tariff regime, and increasing tariffs for household
consumers, were politically difficult decisions, particularly for a coalition government. Overall,
political risks have diminished over the past three years. The transition to a democratically
elected government (in October 2002) took place without major incident, and the subsequent
change in leadership within the ruling political coalition (in August 2004) also proceeded
smoothly and without causing any disruption. Regional tensions have also subsided over the
past year, and there is encouraging progress towards the normalization of relations with India.
However, the tensions in Balochistan and in the tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan,
continue to pose a challenge and, if they escalate, could negatively impact growth and
investment in the future.

25.    Delays in implementation, insufficient institutional capacity, and adverse exogenous
shocks remain the biggest risks to the government's reform program. With respect to exogenous
shocks, increased international oil price will act as a drag on growth, and have increased the oil
import bill in the first three quarters of 2004-05 by 31 percent over the same period in the
previous year. Depending on the Government's policy choices, in particular the extent to which
it chooses not to collect PDL, it poses threats to the maintenance of macro-economic stability
and/or consumes revenues that could be used towards PRSP expenditures. Inflation has also
increased over the past year, due in part to the rapid growth of M2 over the past two years and
more recently due to the increase in fuel prices. There is also a need to remain vigilant regarding
the impact of rapidly expanding credit on banking sector non-performing loans. Growth could
also fall short of the ambitious targets set out in the PRSP, due to security concerns that limit
investments, or adverse weather conditions that negatively impact agricultural production.

26.    While technical and institutional capacity of the government is gradually being
strengthened, more needs to be done, particularly with regards to the recently formed local
governments that have the main responsibility for service delivery. In addition, continuing
political tensions between the provincial and local governments could negatively affect the
achievement of the government's human development targets. The upcoming local government
elections this year will have an important bearing on the political relations between the
provincial and local governments, and on the functionality of local governments.

6. Bank and Borrower Performance

27.    Overall Bank performance during the identification, preparation, and appraisal of PRSC-
1 was satisfactory. The Bank's multi-sectoral team sustained a high-level and intense dialogue
with the government. The operation was informed by the lessons of past adjustment operations


                                                    9

(SAC 1 and SAC 2) as well as the considerable analytical work undertaken over the past three
years. The interaction with other development partners has also been satisfactory. The PRSC
complemented the IMF's PRGF, and it is expected that the PRSC will be the main vehicle to
improve collaboration and consistency of program support by Pakistan's largest donors. UK's
DFID has proposed to provide budget assistance to the Government in parallel to the PRSC, and
the US has also expressed interest in broadly aligning its economic assistance with the PRSC
program.

28.    Borrower performance has been largely satisfactory. The government's PRSP, which
this program supported, was prepared with extensive stakeholder consultation. The government
worked well with the Bank preparation team, with the Ministry of Finance assuming an overall
leadership, coordination, and monitoring role. .Continuity in leadership of the key economic
policy team in the government, in the Ministry of Finance in general, and within the PRSP
Secretariat in particular, greatly aided the ownership and implementation of the program, and
will remain necessary to insure the success of subsequent operations.

7. Findings and Implications for Subsequent Operation(s) in Series

29.    Given that Pakistan is a federation, with major service delivery responsibilities devolved
to provincial and local governments, it is important that future PRSCs focus on key policy
reforms that are within the domain of the federal government. PRSCs would therefore continue
to need to be complemented with provincial adjustment operations, such as those in Punjab and
NWFP, which could focus more heavily on service delivery improvements.

30.    The approach of using a one-tranche operation appears to be working well. The CAS
advocates the use of a series of one-trance adjustment credits to the federal and provincial
governments that will provide predictable and performance based budgetary support, and will
also help the Bank manage risks by pacing its assistance with the government's ability to pursue
reforms, and to give assurance of just-in-time support.

31.    As Pakistan's three-year arrangement under the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) ended in December 2004, future PRSC's will need to pay greater attention to the
monitoring of key macroeconomic indicators. Future PRSCs will also need to be informed by a
number of analytical activities currently underway (on labor markets, safety nets, disease
surveillance, civil service pensions, and on gender).

32.    Subsequent PRSCs will also need to support, and be informed by, development of timely
and reliable sources of data.     There are good prospects for a comprehensive strategy to be
developed within the next few months to strengthen Pakistan's statistical systems. The last
major national household survey providing a national poverty headcount and social sector
outcome indicators was conducted in 2001-02. Currently two major surveys --- the CWIQ and a
Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) ­ are in the field, and will provide social
sector and poverty data by July 2005 and December 2005 respectively, and will therefore
provide much needed data to inform subsequent operations, in particular PRSC 3.
