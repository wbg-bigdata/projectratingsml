                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The progress with disbursements following the 6-month extension granted to the Closing Date in June 2011 has been exceptional. Of the approximately US$ 16.5 million undisbursed
                         from the additional financing credit as of June 30, 2011, the Project has disbursed essentially the entire amount as of December 15, 2011. The 6-month extension to the Closing
                         Date (granted in June 2011), together with an over-commitment and the provision of disbursements on a ‘first-come-first-served’ basis has enabled (and also motivated) ongoing sub-
                         projects to fully utilize the funds available from the Credit. The GEF grant has been almost fully disbursed as of December 15, 2011. As such, the overall implementation progress of
                         RERED is “Satisfactory.?
