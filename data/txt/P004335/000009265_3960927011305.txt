MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTER)tATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALDIVES
FOR AN EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROJECT
I.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed develop-
ment credit to the Republic of Maldives for SDR 6.00 million (IJS$8.19 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 40 years' maturity and would help finance an education
and training project.
2.        Background.  The Republic of Maldives has a population of about
180,000 scattered over 200 islands in the Indian Ocean. The literacy level in
the local language (Dhivehi) is 91Z and is equal for males and females.
Primary education has expanded rapidly in recent years and the gross
enrollment ratio is now about 90%. However, quality improvement has not kept
pace with expanding enrollments especially in the island primary schools. A
shortage of trained teachers and a lack of teaching materials have retarded
the effort to extend the modern curriculum throughout the island schools. In
response, the Government is expanding the supply of trained teachers and
teaching materials and establishing fully staffed and equipped primary schools
in the atolls capable of teaching the modern curriculum. These efforts are
receiving strong support from bilateral donors. At the secondary level the
teaching language is English, necessitacing the employment of significant
numbers of expatriate teachers. Their quality is often low and turnover is
high resulting in low pass rates in the terminal examinations at grades 10 and
12. Therefore the Government is currently developing a strategy aimed at
improving recruitment policies to provide higher quality expatriate secondary
teachers until, in the long term, they can be replaced by Maldivians.
Although primary schooling has traditionally been the terminal point for most
students, secordary enrollments have been expanded in recent years. This has
largely been in response to the need for better educated people to service a
rapidly growing economy but also, as now planned, to extend secondary educa-
tion opportunities to the islands. The lack of people with secondary
education has restricted opportunities for higher education and training which
of necessity must be undertaken overseas. This has retarded the development
of skilled manpower and although recourse has been made to the employment of
expatriates, shortages of skilled manpower remain the major constraint to the
country's development.
3.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA has reviewed the overall status
of education and training in Maldives and two major areas suitable for
external assistance are evident: (a) raising the quality of primary education
in the islands and the related need for expanding and improving primary
teacher training; and (b) the need to expand the supply of skilled manpower.
At present, Government efforts with donor assistance, are addressing
satisfactorily the problems in primary education and teacher training. IDA
has therefore decided to focus on manpower development in its first operation
in the education sector. The proposed project responds to the shortage of



skilled manpower which is posing a crucial constraint to development in the
Maldives. The project provides assistance for overseas fellowships to
increase the supply of high level manpower, but also seeks to alleviate the
basic bottleneck in manpower development namely the shortage of people with
adequate education levels to take up training opportunities. Hence the
project also supports the expansion and upgrading of secondary education. The
proposed project is viewed as the first in a series of operations to support
the long-term development of human resources in the Maldives. Consequently,
the project includes studies and technical assistance to address long term
issues and provide the context for the development of future projects.
4.        Project Objectives.  The project is designed to alleviate skilled
manpower shortages through expanding the opportunities for higher level
training overseas and by increasing the capacity and improving the quality of
secondary education in Maldives. The project would improve the planning
capacity of MOE and strengthen project management capacity in MPD. It would
also improve labor market information which would lead in the longer term to
greater responsiveness of education and training to labor market needs.
5.        Project Description.  The project would: (a) finance a program of
about 171 study years of overseas fellowships for higher-level training;
(b) upgrade the quality of upper secondary education at the Science Education
Center and establish a regional secondary school to provide opportunities for
secondary schooling in the islands; and (c) finance fellowships and experts to
improve the planning capacity of MOE, strengthen project management capacity
in MPD, improve labor market information and undertake studies relating to
teacher and labor market issues. The project, to be carried out over seven
years, would finance civil works, furniture and equipment, fellowship
training, experts, books and teaching materials. The total cost of the
project is estimated at US$9.34 million equivalent with a foreign exchange
component of US$8.19 million (88%). A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan is shown in Schedule A. Retroactive financing of US$ 0.2 million for
expenditures after June 18, 1988, will be provided for fellowships and
equipment. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Maldives are
given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 7367-MAL dated December 20, 1988, is being distributed
separately.
6.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following actions:
(a) the three Maldivian specialists (education planner, education evaluator
and labor market information specialist) would be recruited by May 31, 1989,
(b) a labor market information system would be developed and become opera-
tional by March 31, 1991; (c) the fellowship program would be implemented in
accordance with administrative procedures satisfactory to the Association; and
(d) the Project Implementation Unit would be maintained in the MPD and a
Project Coordinating Committee would assist overall coordination and
management of the project.
7.        Benefits.  The project would raise the quality and increase the
output of skilled and educated manpower thereby alleviating the severe



manpower shortages in the Maldives. Equity of access to secondary education
would be improved by the establishment of the first secondary school in the
atolls in which girls would have equal enrollments with boys. The 220
additional places for girls would increase female enrollment in the secondary
school system by 50X. The project would also lead to improved planning and
management of the education system and better information on the labor
market. In the long run, this would lead to greater responsiveness of
education and training to labor market needs.
8.        Risks.  The major risk concerns the ability of the Government to
implement the project efficiently. Project authorities lack experience in
project management and familiarity with Association procedures and
requirements. To reduce this risk, an experienced implementation advisor will
be employed and expert advice will be provided in procurement and
accounting. These experts will work with local counterparts who will receive
appropriate training overseas. Project activities will also need to be
coordinated between two agencies and to facilitate this, the senior-level
Project Coordinating Committee would be established to provide overall policy
guidance and coordination.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
