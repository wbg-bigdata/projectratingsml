I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
1.01      Like other centrally planned economies, China's economy is very
"transport intensive."  With the same land area, US freight traffic is only
four and a half times the freight traffic of China for a GNP nine times that
of China. This intensity of transport is explained mainly by two factors:
(a) the historical emphasis on heavy industry requiring movements of ores,
steel and other products; and (b) the high level of energy consumption, per
unit of output in China's industry (energy use per unit of GDP is two and a
half times that of other LDCs).
1.02      Investments.  Over the period 1949-79, some Y 110 billion, or 17% of
all new investment coming under the heading "State Capital Construction," went
to transport. In comparison with other countries, transport investments
appear somewhat on the low side. In the first two decades after liberation,
the railways absorbed well over 50% of all new investments in the transport
sector (Table 1.1). Most railway investments went to construct new lines to
the interior, while the northeast plains and coastal areas have 80% of the
railway's freight traffic. As a result, major capacity constraints developed
and are now particularly evident in coal transport.
1.03      Because of the recent expansion of external trade, increasing
emphasis has been given lately to the development of ports and ocean ship-
ping. Many berths were constructed in the 1970s in China's 15 major ports.
Investments in the shipping fleet have also been large, averaging about
Y 500 million p.a. since 1976. By contrast, investments in inland waterways
and roads over the past 30 years have been modest. Nevertheless, an average
25,000 km of roads has been added to the network annually since liberation,
much of it at rather low standards.
1.04      Traffic Trends.  Domestic freight transported in 1981 reached
852 billion ton-km (t-km), a 12-fold increase since 1952, or an average annual
rate of almost 9%, systematically higher than the growth of domestic pro-
duct. The relationship of freight growth to overall economic growth is,
however, less than that experienced by some other low income LDCs, which
reflects the development policy emphasis given to regional self-sufficiency
rather than to interregional trade in foodstuffs and consumer goods. The
modal split has moved toward a more balanced use of modes, but the railways
still handle 67% of traffic versus 82% in 1952; this predominance is expected
to continue for quite some time.
1.05      Passenger traffic reached 274 billion passenger-km (p-km) in 1982,
an 11-fold increase since 1952 and an average annual growth rate above 8%.
Since 1978, growth averaged 12% p.a., well above twice the overall rate of
economic growth. This illustrates the potential demand for travel as income
grows. It is likely that this growth would have been even higher if it had
not been constrained by the limited capacity, particularly of the railways, to
offer more passenger services. The modal split has shifted more rapidly than
for freight toward the road mode, and the railways now handle less than 60% of
the traffic versus over 80% in 1952.



-2-
1.06      Railways and Energy Transport.  Coal provides over 70% of the energy
consumed in China and as a result of economic resforms, production has increased
rapidly from 550 million tons (mt) in 1977 to 666 mt in 1982. The recently
released 1981-85 plan target is for 700 mt by 1985.  The railways play a key
role in the distribution of energy, mainly coal.  In 1981 the railways trans-
ported 412 mt of coal and this traffic accounted for 32% of the total t-km
performed that year.  However, transport bottlenecks developed in railways and
to a lesser extent in ports. Despite lower total production in 1980 and 1981,
a stockpile of over 10 mt has accumulated in Shanxi Province alone because of
lack of rail capacity. Some of these stocks are being lost due to spontaneous
combustion. Recent production statistics for 1982, up 7% from 1981, indicate
that the situation has probably worsened recently.
1-07      Shanxi is endowed with one third of all coal reserves in China, and
is also more accessible to consuming areas! than other coal rich areas in the
remote northeast or Inner Mongolia. In 1982, coal production in Shanxi
reached 144 mt, 20% of the national total. Mine developments presently under
way and planned are expected to bring production over 150 mt by 1985/86 and
possibly near 200 mt in the early 1990s. This includes a mine that will be
developed under a proposed Bank project. Railway capacity to move coal from
Shanxi to industrial areas and ports on the east coast is presently limited
to less than 90 mt p.a. The Ministry of Railways (MR) has launched a major
investment plan on seven routes to increase their capacity to over 150 mt p.a.
by 1986 (Table 1.2). The proposed project is a direct contribution to the
capacity increase of two of these seven lines.
1.08      Other Transport Modes.  Port traffic grew rapidly in the 1976-81
period, reflecting the economic opening of China to foreign trade. Annual
growth averaged 11.3%. Domestic coastal shipping and inland water transport
also increased substantially. As a result, ports became congested despite
commendable efforts to achieve high productivity. A major effort to modernize
ports started in the early 1970s and continues with particular emphasis on
container and bulk terminals, the latter mainly for coal. The Bank's first
transport operation in China was the Three Ports Project (Loan 2207-CHA,
1982), which includes a coal berth at Huangpu.
1.09      The highway network comprised about 897,000 km in 1982, of which
about 151,000 km were asphalted. Road pavement standards are low and the
extent of the paved network is limited. Road maintenance, however, is well
organized and currently absorbs much of the attention and resources of the
provincial and other road authorities. Except for Western China, the highway
network is still very much a system of feeder roads to the railways. Never-
theless, motor traffic on the national highways since 1978 reportedly has
grown at a very high overall annual average of 15%.
1.10      Transport Issues and Objectives in the 1980s.  The Sixth Five-Year
Plan 1981-85 (SFYP) approved in December 1982, includes Y 27.5 billion (16.2%
of the total) earmarked for transport sector inviestments. The railways would
get 63% of this amount.  The plan document does not directly mention issues in
the transport sector, but a number of other recent publications give a fairly
consistent picture of some key problems. The most important sectoral issues
at this time are: (a) the capacity constraints both for freight and passenger



-3-
movements; (b) the appropriate economic role of the various modes and in par-
ticular the modal allocation of short distance traffic; (c) the management of
the transport system including policy, planning, coordination and pricing; (d)
the choice of technologies for infrastructure as well as vehicles; and (e) the
training and development of staff in all the above matters.
II. THE RAILWAY SUBSECTOR
2.01      Long-term Bank Objectives.  The Bank's long-term objective is to
assist MR in introducing such changes in policies, institutions, infrastruc-
ture, motive power and rolling stock, terminals, and operations that are
necessary for the railway to meet, in a cost effective manner, the increasing
demand for railway transport generated by growth in the economy. The vehicle
for this dialogue in the longer term would be railway sector lending opera-
tions focusing on specific issues, such as relieving regional transport
infrastructure bottlenecks, modernizing motive power technology, improving
manufacture and maintenance of motive power and rolling stock, improving
terminal handling operations and modernizing education and training. The
proposed project is a first step in the introduction of such sector lending
operations, and would involve the removal of important bottlenecks for trans-
porting coal from the Shanxi coal fields to the coast, as well as some initial
activities involving costing, manpower planning, education and technology.
2.02      Organization, Management and Staff.  The railways of China are the
major carrier in the modern transport sector and have their own Ministry.
Operations are largely in the hands of 18 regional administrations (RRAs).
Each administration, headed by a General Manager, is made up of eight depart-
ments and three or more operating subadministrations. Altogether MR employs
2.7 million people, of whom 1.6 million are involved in the transportation
function. The others are engaged in industry (MR operates 68 factories pro-
ducing locomotives, rolling stock, etc.), capital construction (new railway
track, bridges, electrification, workshops, housing, etc.), education and
other activities.
2.03      Education and Training.  This is a very important function of MR
which operates over 2,000 schools with 100,000 teachers and staff. At the top
of the system are 10 universities of which seven are technical, two medical
and the last a teachers' college. Most universities now also have graduate
programs. There are also eight research institutes. For high school
graduates who cannot enter university, MR operates over 60 Intermediate
Technical Schools with two-year programs and Technical Workers Schools to
train locomotive drivers and other trade workers. In addition, MR operates
middle and primary schools with enrollment exceeding one million. Outside
this formal education system, MR has 20 Staff Training Colleges for in-service
training. The problems encountered by MR are similar to those of others
dealing with education in China. Programs need modification to reflect the
technological changes which are accompanying for example, the gradual switch
from steam to diesel and electric traction, with emphasis on management and
on economic and financial analysis. Most teaching materials now in use were
written in the 50s and 60s and need upgrading- Also, education and training



- 4 -
are too narrowly specialized and MR wishes to move to more comprehensive
training to increase the flexibility of future staff assignments.  A second
railway project now under preparation may include an education and training
component to address some of these issues.
2.04      Railway Facilities.  The railway system in China has more than
doubled in size since 1949 from 22,000 route-km to about 50,000 km of which
8,300 km were double or multiple track and some 1,700 km electrified at the
end of 1981. Further double tracking and electrification are in progress.
2.05      The locomotive fleet consists of aboult 10,000 units, 75% of which
are steam, 22% diesel, and 3% electric. Demand for electric locomotives will
increase rapidly to some 120 locomotives per year by 1985-86. This project
includes urgently needed equipment to increase production capacity from 40
locos p.a. to 120 locos p.a. A second project now under preparation will
focus on improving locomotive technology with the assistance of an inter-
national panel of specialized consultants. In 1979, the freight car fleet
numbered 259,000. In recent years, rolling stock acquisitions have generally
kept pace with traffic growth except in 1981, reflecting the overall economic
slowdown experienced during that year. Passenger coach acquisition has
increased over the last few years, following the rapidly rising demand for
passenger travel. It is, however, still below MR's estimated need of at least
1,200 coaches p.a.
2.06      Traffic and Operations.  China has the third largest freight railway
system in the world after the USSR and the USA. Freight traffic has grown
from about 100 million tons in 1950 to over 1 billion tons in 1981 (Table 2.1)
while ton-km grew from 39.4 billion to 570.2 billion or at an average rate of
9% p.a (Table 2.2). Recently, freight traffic has grown less rapidly,
averaging about 5.7% p.a. since 1977. Ten commodities: coal, timber, iron
and steel products, construction materials, petroleum, grain, non-metallic
ores, fertilizer, metallic ores and cement (in that order) account for about
75% of the ton-km. Average transport distance has increased continuously from
395 km in 1950 to 544 km in 1981 (Table 2.3).   The global freight traffic
forecast included in the SFYP is for 666 billion ton-km in 1985, a 3.0% p.a.
growth over 1980. The strong 1982 growth more than compensated for the 1981
stagnation making the combined two-year growth 8%, somewhat ahead of the
forecast. Passenger traffic has grown from about 150 million passengers in
1950 to 950 million in 1981, while p-km grew from 21.2 billion to 147 billion
or at an average rate of 6.5% p.a. Passenger traffic exploded since 1978,
increasing 44% in four years and putting heavy demand on the existing
equipment as well as on line capacity (Table 2.4). The growth of passenger
traffic is exceeding forecasts and it is clear that passenger traffic will
continue to be determined more by the capacity provided by the railways than
by the market's demand.
2.07      Operations are efficient and show a high level of track and
equipment utilization (Table 2.5). Traffic dens:Lty is the second highest in
the world after the USSR. It averages 11.9 mill-ion net t-km per route-km for
freignt and 3.1 million p-km per route-km for passengers. Freight car
turnaround time (at 3.0 days) is extremely low and it is difficult to see
further savings here. The number of freight cars per train has remained



- 5 -
relatively constant at around 35 cars. This is largely a consequence of the
length of passing loops which is 650 m for 75% of the stations and 850 m for
the rest. A number of station lengthening programs is under way to allow
operation of longer trains in the future.
2.08      Planning and Investments.  Coordination of railway investment
planning is the responsibility of the Planning and Statistics Bureau at the
Ministry's headquarters. The emphasis of the SFYP is to increase the coal
carrying capacity from western provinces to the east coast. A secondary
objective is to relieve capacity constraints on lines of the eastern seaboard
and in particular to develop more passenger transport facilities. Railway
investments have fluctuated considerably over the past 30 years, somewhat in
tune with general economic development. After a rapid buildup in the 1950s,
investments fell off considerably in the early 1960s. They gradually
increased again to reach their highest levels during the Fourth Five-Year Plan
(1971-75), averaging almost Y 3.5 billion p.a. In recent years, they have
fallen off again, particularly in 1981 when MR was allocated less than Y 1.5
billion for investments, as a consequence of economic retrenchment and
reformulation of Government economic policies.
2.09      The Ministry of Railways has four general design institutes which
are adequately staffed with competent staff. Over the years, these institutes
have designed a large number of civil work projects, such as new tracks, track
doubling, tunnels, buildings, small and medium-size bridges. The designs are
well adapted to labor-intensive construction methods which are adequate in
China. In addition, there are two other institutes specialized in both design
and construction of electrification and major bridges, respectively. The
Electrification Institute has prepared all electrification projects to date
(about 1,600 km) on the basis of technology widely used in developed
countries, i.e., 25 KV-50 Hz. The Major Bridge Institute has designed and
executed a number of very large projects including the Nanjing Bridge (14 km
including approaches, with a double railway track on the lower deck and a six-
lane highway on the upper deck) and seven other large bridges over the Yangtze
River. All these projects are of a high technical standard.
2.10      The Ministry of Railways has five construction bureaus in charge of
track and general civil works, a factory construction bureau and a tunnel
construction bureau, all of which have experienced, skilled and management
staff (unskilled labor is recruited locally for each project). The
construction quality is good. The projects have generally been completed on
or ahead of time, and cost overruns are the exception.
2.11      Tariffs and Costs.  Rates and fares were not changed between 1967
and December 1, 1983, when freight tariffs were revised. This revision con-
sisted mainly of: the doubling of the minimum distance charged, from 50 to
100 km; and a 23% rate increase covering 75% of freight, including bulk
commodities like coal, cement, oil, and fertilizer. The current average
freight haul of about 550 km corresponds to an average net receipt (after
sales tax) of Fen 1.43 per ton-km, which compares favorably with the average
operating cost of about Fen 0.94 per ton-km, leaving a wide profit margin of
52% above operating costs. For passengers, the average distance traveled is
156 km, and the average gross revenue per passenger km is Fen 1.46 as compared



-6-
to the estimated average cost of Fen 1.08, i.e. a profit margin of 35% above
operating costs. Consequently, railway operations are highly profitable.
2.12      There is a substantial amount of costing data available at
administration and subadministration levels, but little of these are developed
at MR level, where "gross" costing is the rule. The Ministry of Railways
acknowledges that the findings of their comprehensive costing studies carried
out some 15 to 20 years ago (and on the basis of which the still prevailing
tariff structure was fixed) are outdated. Undier the proposed project, MR will
carry out a comprehensive railway costing study (paras. 3.10 and 5.19).
2.13      Budget, Accounting and Audit.  The Ministry of Railways' financial
procedures are recorded in a comprehensive "Manual on Railway Finances". The
annual recurrent budget is prepared at subadministration and administration
levels and ultimately finalized at the MR leveL (Project File). The annual
capital budget is prepared at the MR level within the global allocation of
resources earmarked by the State Planning Commission. Since 1983, MR is to
pay to the State (a) sales tax set at 15% of gross operating revenue; (b)
income tax set at 55% of net profits; and (c) the share of after tax profits
it is not allowed to retain. The same system applies to the Zhuzhou factory,
but the sales tax rate has been set at 5.3%.  The State uses part of the
proceeds of the tax to finance railways and factory investments.
2.14      The Ministry of Railways' accounting procedures are generally
satisfactory. The Ministry of Railways is usinig a double-entry accounting
system on an accrual basis; the dual recording concept is applied although the
debit-credit technique has been replaced by an "increase-decrease" system.
The most unusual feature of both MR and the Zhuzhou factory is the dual system
of depreciation, which comprises a basic provision of 3% and an additional
"provision for major repairs" which grew from 1% in 1979 to 3.5% in 1982 (2.5%
for the Zhuzhou factory). The handling of this provision as a component of
depreciation is debatable since maintenance should normally be charged to
working expenses. This dual system is based on the cumulated historic gross
value of depreciable fixed assets instead of taking into account the actual
economic life of depreciable items. This handling of depreciation distorts
the true earning position of MR and the Zhuzhou factory (para. 5.11). There
are other shortcomings in financial procedures like the lack of long-term
financial planning and insufficient use of data processing.
2.15      Audit.  The Ministry of Railways has a "Financial Checking Division"
which performs internal auditing; it also checks the correlation of revenue
and expenditure with planned allocations. The Peoples' Bank of China (PBC) is
MR's paying and collecting agent and keeps a close record of MR's budgetary
allocations including their subsequent adjustments. The Peoples' Bank of
China's inspectors regularly check the use of funds by MR. The Peoples'
Construction Bank of China (PCBC) fulfills a similar role for investment
funds. The Ministry of Railways produces an annual report which is sent for
review to the Ministry of Finance within five months after the close of the
fiscal year. The Ministry of Finance issues a Certificate of Approval. The
above-described control system is satisfactory for project implementation.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
3.01      In July 1982, the Government requested Bank assistance in financing
urgently needed rail investments necessary to transport the increasing coal
production. The proposed project was prepared by the Government and Bank
staff; it was appraised in March/April 1983. This project would make a direct
contribution to the Government's overall plan for increasing the supply of
energy which is urgently needed to support economic development in China. It
would also provide assistance to MR for expanding and improving electric loco-
motive production and for long-term design upgrading in electric locomotive
technology, which could eventually be implemented in a subsequent project.
Capacity wise it would help remove some of the existing constraints of the
railway network to move coal between the mines of Shanxi Province and major
industrial centers and ports in eastern China. This work forms part of a
regional plan of construction and upgrading on seven different lines and three
ports and is expected to be completed by 1986 (Table 1.2 and Map IBRD 17096).
B.  Project Description -/
Xinxiang to Yanzhou Line (305 km)
3.02      This line, in Henan and Shandong Provinces, will close the gap
between the coal production areas of southern Shanxi and the line presently
being built between Yanzhou and the new east coast port of Shijiusuo. Both
the line and the port are under construction with Japanese financial assis-
tance and completion is expected by the end of 1985. It is therefore impor-
tant that the Xinxiang-Yanzhou line be completed at about the same time. The
project would include:
(a)  construction of 165 km of single track between Xinxiang and Heze;
(b)  a 10 km long bridge across the Yellow River, which is part of item
(a);
(c)  upgrading and capacity increases on the existing Heze-Yanzhou line
(139.5 km); and
(d)  connections to other lines and yards at Xinxiang and Yanzhou.
3.03      The Xinxiang-Heze section will be constructed to design standards
allowing operation of 3,500 ton trains (steam traction), and would have an
overall capacity of 22 million tons per year. In general, the terrain is flat
and presents few construction problems. The existing Heze-Yanzhou line would
be upgraded to a similar standard (currently it can only handle 2,700 ton
trains) which is also the one being used for the neighboring Yanzhou-Shijiusuo
1/   A more detailed description of the project components is given in Annex 1.



- 8 -
section, now under construction. Thus, after completion, coal trains would
run between Xinxiang and Shijiusuo without intermediate marshalling. The
additional coal traffic requires construction of- rail connnections (involving
new station and yard facilities) at Xinxiang and Yanzhou.
3.04      The Ministry of Railways considered various possible alignments for
the 10 km long Yellow River rail bridge (see Map IBRD 17097R), which, at
US$110 million equivalent, constitutes a very large single item in the overall
project construction plan. Two options to the north of the site eventually
selected were rejected on account of flood risk involving potential washout of
track to the west of the river. A third site was rejected because of higher
costs associated with a longer central steel section than needed for the site
eventually chosen. The chosen site, although involving the longest total
length of bridge work, requires a relatively short steel truss portion (1.6
km) directly over the river. Adjacent areas present a very low flood risk,
and are thus highly suitable for adjoining track. West of the steel truss
section, there will be a 4 km steel girder section. Concrete approaches on
both sides will total about 4.5 km.
3.05      During appraisal, the possibility of aL double-track bridge was also
discussed, but rejected as not economically justified. However, at the sug-
gestion of the Bank team, a crossing loop was added on the western access of
the main bridge, which will reduce the length of the critical (single track)
section from about 14 km to 8 km, thereby increasing line capacity from less
than 17 million ton per year (mtpy) to about 22, at a relatively modest cost.
Datong-Taiyuan Line (355 km)
3.06      This line is located in Shanxi Province and links Datong, the
largest mining center in northern Shanxi, with Taiyuan, the provincial capi-
tal, also a major mining and industrial center. The project would include:
(a)  double-tracking of two sections totalling 127 km which are major
bottlenecks at present;
(b)  lengthening of all (34) existing crossing stations from 650 to 850 m;
(c)  construction of four additional crossing stations; and
(d)  line electrification in 25 KV-5OHz, the standard in use elsewhere in
China, and Centralized Traffic Control signalling on 355 route-km
(about 540 track-km).
3.07      The impact of double tracking and electrification as proposed will
be a significant increase in overall capacity (from 7 to 22 million tons per
annum) as associated with a train size of 3,000 tons (and 3,500 tons over some
stretches) compared with 1,400-1,500 tons currently. Rugged terrain and steep
gradients will require double and triple heading over certain sections.



Electric Locomotives: Manufacture and Technical Assistance
3.08      This component would assist the Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Factory
(the only one in China) in increasing its output to meet the overall demand
for electric locomotives which will be needed by the proposed project as well
as other electrification projects presently under construction. This project
would therefore include:
(a)  equipment (mainly modern machine tools not produced in China) needed
to increase and improve production of electric locomotives of the
present design (Shaoshan Types I and III) to meet the forecast
demand of 120 locomotives per year in 1986 and thereafter; and
(b)  technical assistance and training in areas of:
- general mechanical and electrical technology and practices;
- use and maintenance of the more advanced equipment referred to in
(a) above; and
- specialized technology and management practices.
3.09      A comprehensive program has been set up, under which Chinese
operators, foremen and engineers will study and gain practical experience
abroad (510 manmonths). Also, foreign specialists will come to China to teach
and demonstrate modern technologies and practices (38 manmonths). The average
cost of overseas training for Chinese operators is US$1,700 per manmonth
including travel and subsistence but excluding salary. The average cost of
foreign experts in China is US$10,900 per manmonth, including travel, salary
and subsistence. The total cost of the program is about US$1.3 million.
Foreign experts for specialized training on modern imported equipment would be
provided by the supplier, i.e., the successful bidder under International
Competitive Bidding (ICB). Other technical assistance would be contracted
according to Bank guidelines. The detailed composition, scheduling and cost
of this program is given in Annex 2. To facilitate disbursements against the
costs of the training program, a revolving fund will be established
(para. 3.18).
Costing Study
3.10      To update and improve its costing system, MR will undertake a
costing study. The aim of the study will be to improve the existing costing
methodology and thereafter install a costing system that will improve railway
operations and management. This study will be performed in separate phases
over several years (ending December 31, 1989), since some adjustments are
generally necessary after an initial period of implementation. It will be
carried out by a team to be organized by MR and staffed by representatives of
MR administrations, subadministrations, and institutes or universities. After
completion of each stage, reports will be prepared and submitted to the Bank
for an exchange of views with the study team and MR. Terms of reference for
the study and details on its implementation are given in Annex 3.

C. Cost Estimates and Financing
3.11      Detailed designs are completed for all project works.  Quantities
were derived from final engineering and unit prices are based on recent
experience with similar works. Estimated project costs are expressed in March
1984 prices. Physical contingencies of 5% are included for infrastructure
works. Annual price contingencies were applied to local and foreign costs as
follows:  7.5% in 1984, 7% in 1985, and 6% in 1SI86 and 1987.  An exchange rate
of Y 2.0 to US$1 was used for the calculation of the US dollar equivalent
costs.  The estimated project cost, including contingencies, the charge on the
use of foreign exchange under Government's internal settlement rate system,
and the capitalized front-end fee of US$0.5 million is about US$793 million,
of which about US$251 million represents direct and indirect foreign exchange
costs. Aggregated and detailed cost estimates are given in Tables 3.1 to
3.9. The Government has requested a loan of US$220 million which would cover
about 88% of the estimated total foreign exchange costs. The Ministry of
Railways will finance other materials, equipment and construction costs from
its own resources.
3.12      The proposed Bank loan would finance selected materials and
equipment for infrastructure works, equipment for the locomotive factory,
technical assistance and training. A list of items to be financed by the
proposed loan is given in Tables 3.10 to 3.18. A summary of the project costs
and of the proposed loan is shown on page 11.

Notes:  1. Total physical contingencies are about 5% of base costs; local and foreign price
contingencies are about 3.9% of the respective base cost plus physical
contingencies. This percentage is lowr than usual because (a) some preparatory work
vas done in 1983 (with little foreign exchange and no retroactive Bank financing) for
which there is no need for price contingencies, and (b) the implementation schedule
is front-loaded, with about half of the expenditure planned for 1984.
2. Import taxes and duties are not included in project costs and Government will not
charge such taxes and duties on imports attributable to this project.



- 12 -
D. Project Implementation
3.13      Civil works, track laying and installation of electrification equip-
ment (substations, catenary, signalling and telecommunications) will be imple-
mented by MR using two of its Construction BureaLus, the Major Bridge Bureau
and the Electrification Bureau, (paras. 2.09 and 2.10), in accordance with the
detailed schedules given in Tables 3.19 to 3.23. These agencies are well
staffed with key technical specialists and skilled workers as well as with
managers and supervisory personnel. They are highly experienced in the type
of works to be carried out and with the labor-intensive methods of construc-
tion that are appropriate. The construction bureaus generally provide skilled
manpower and supervision, while entering into agreements with local authori-
ties for unskilled labor requirements. The Ministry of Railways' construction
bureaus have built an average of 1,000 km of track each year over the last
decade, which has involved projects calling for similar techniques and
methods, and are well able to maintain the pace and scale of the project con-
struction program. Completion of construction/ upgrading of the track
sections would be by end 1986, with electrification of the Datong-Taiyuan line
by end 1987. The Zhuzhou factory modernization plan would be substantially
completed by 1986, with the last machine tools installed in 1987.
E. Procurement
3.14      Procurement of selected materials and equipment for infrastructure
works and equipment for the locomotive factory (totalling about $217 mil-
lion) will be subject to international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance
with Bank guidelines for procurement. Small items of equipment, mainly hand
tools and measuring aids, worth less than US$100,000 per contract and totaling
less than US$1.0 million, will be purchased on the basis of quotations from at
least three suppliers in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Procurement under ICB will be divided into about 30 packages, ranging in value
from US$300,000 to US$40 million (Table 3.24). In bid evaluation, Chinese
manufacturers will be allowed a preferential margin of 15% of the CIF cost of
competing imports, or the relevant prevailing level of customs duties,
whichever is lower.
3.15      For items not financed by the Bank, Government procurement proce-
dures will apply. Such items comprise civil works, to be undertaken by MR's
construction bureaus as described in para. 3.13, various local materials, and
miscellaneous equipment. As regards the procurement of civil works, the
arrangements proposed for the project are similar to those in use throughout
China. They involve the assignment of construction contracts to one of the
construction bureaus specialized for the particular type of works (in this
case a construction bureau of the Ministry of Railways), with a contract which
details the work to be done, unit prices, quantities and completion schedules,
bonus and penalties for early/late completion, and compensations through
additional payments or extension of time for factors beyond the contractor's
control. Major materials such as cement and steel are independently arranged
by the owner and supplied to the construction bureau. In this case, such
materials are to be procured through ICB and financed by the Bank loan. Costs
of work carried out by the construction bureaus compare favorably with
international contracts for similar works.



- 13 -
3.16      The construction schedule precludes international competitive
bidding. In order to complete the Yellow River Bridge and the new Xinxiang-
Yanzhou line by end-1985/early 1986, construction has to begin in early 1984,
and the construction bureaus are already being mobilized. These two elements
of the project are urgently needed to link the coal producing areas to the
Yanzhou-Shijiusuo line which is now under construction and scheduled for
completion by end-1985. Preparation of bidding documents, bidding, bid
evaluation and construction mobilization could lead to a delay of at least one
year, which would impose a significant financial penalty on the coal producers
and the railways.
3.17      The Government is giving thought to modifying existing practices for
dealing with civil works construction. It has already done so in a recent
power project, where ICB was made possible for a special component of civil
works (water conductor-pressure tunnels) and turned out to be successful. In
many sectors, however, the reorganization required would be more fundamental,
since design, construction and supervision of civil works are currently vested
in the Ministries themselves. Under the present arrangement, by which the
construction bureau is a wing of the Ministry and not an independent entity
with financial and managerial independence, it cannot participate in an ICB
for which the Ministry is the Purchaser. Companies with administrative,
financial and legal independence would have to be created, as was done in the
case of the power project mentioned above. This will take time and effort to
accomplish. The Bank's intention is to continue pressing the Government to
introduce necessary organizational and legal changes leading to the creation
of independent companies, which would be able to participate in railway civil
works construction under ICB, in China and abroad.
F. Disbursements
3.18      Disbursement of the proposed loan would be as follows:
(a) 100% of the CIF cost of imported equipment and materials;
(b) 100% of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment and
materials;
(c) 100% of the cost of technical assistance and overseas training.
Domestic transport from port or factory would not be eligible for Bank
financing. Any savings under the loan would be cancelled unless otherwise
agreed with the Bank. To facilitate disbursements against the cost of
overseas training (para. 3.09), a revolving fund will be established with an
initial deposit of US$200,000, equivalent to about three months of expected
expenditures.
3.19      An estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Table 3.25.  Dis-
bursements are based on the assumption that the proposed loan would become
effective by June 1984.



- 14 -
G. Environment
3.20      No negative impact on the environment is anticipated from the
project. The electrification of the 355 km section between Datong and Taiyuan
(presently steam-operated) will significantly reduce pollution in the area.
The new steam-operated line between Xinxiang and Heze cuts through a
relatively low population density area.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Main Benefits
4.01      The project would make a direct contrilbution to the Government's
overall plan of increasing the supply of energy necessary for the sustained
development of China. It would increase the capacity of the railway network
to move coal between the mines of Shanxi Provinces and east coast ports and
cities (para. 1.07). At present, Shanxi coal mining capacity cannot be fully
utilized because of shortage of railway capacity and limitations on stock-
piling imposed by self-combustion. While the Chinese have started investigat-
ing coal slurry pipeline transportation, Shanxi Province is short of water and
no viable coal transport alternative to railways is available at present. The
project is part of an urgently required rail development program which will
bring the capacity to move coal from Shanxi from less than 90 mt to over
150 mt p.a. by 1986-87. In addition to the rail program, port capacity for
coal is being increased at several existing ports and a new coal port is being
built at Shijiusuo with Japanese assistance. New mines are under development
together with expansion of existing ones. The project would also contribute
to the improvement and expansion of electric locomotive production in China.
4.02      Each ton of coal (a traded good) is projected to be worth about
US$50 FOB Chinese port in 1983 prices (Annex 4, para. 4). The combined pro-
duction, transport and handling costs are estimated at US$23/ton. The net
value added of coal production generated by the coverall energy and transport
development plan is thus US$27/ton. This net value added is the main benefit
from the project. Coal is the main source of energy in China and thus the
benefits of the project will accrue widely throughout the economy. The
detailed economic analysis of the major project components is given below.
4.03      For this analysis, all inputs and outputs were evaluated in mid-1983
constant economic prices. Taxes and duties were excluded from financial
prices. For traded goods, the CIF prices of imports and FOB prices of exports
were used in estimating the cost of materials and equipment with due adjust-
ment for the cost of inland transportation. The official exchange rates were
used to convert foreign currencies to Renminbi. A conversion factor of 0.5
was applied for unskilled labor costs, while the shadow wage rate was
calculated at four times the actual wage for highly qualified supervisory
staff.



- 15 -
B. Xinxiang-Yanzhou Line
4.04      This investment includes the construction of a new section between
Xinxiang and Heze. The existing line from Heze to Yanzhou is presently a
branch line with traffic in the order of 3 mt p.a. near Yanzhou dropping to
about 1 mt p.a. near Heze. This traffic is expected to continue after the new
section is opened, but through coal traffic will be dominant. Among the mines
in south Shanxi which will be served by the line is a mine which will be
developed under the Bank's proposed coal project. This mine would produce
about 4 mt p.a. by the late eighties. The project line will have a capacity
of about 22 mt p.a. Coal traffic in the opening year of 1986 is estimated
around 7 mt, growing rapidly at 10% p.a. and possibly faster in the early
years (Table 4.1).
4.05      The benefits are in terms of value added to coal which will be
transported using the line. Included in the cost streams are the required
investments in: (a) coal mines, estimated on the basis of information from
the proposed Bank coal development project; (b) the. proposed project; (c) the
new rail line between Yanzhou and Shijiusuo; and (d) the new port of
Shijiusuo. The latter two items are presently under construction with finan-
cial assistance from Japan. The economic rate of return of the entire set of
investments above, which includes the proposed project, is 17% with a 25-year
period for benefits. While the life of the mine, rail and port investments is
much longer than 25 years, benefits beyond the 25th year increase the rate of
return only marginally. Details are presented in Annex 4.
C. Datong-Taiyuan Line
4.06      This line has three distinct sections:  a northern third with major
traffic flowing north; a southern third with major flows to the south; and a
middle mountainous section with more balanced traffic. On the northern third,
coal traffic will go through Datong and east to Beijing and Qinhuangdao. From
the other sections, some coal will go through Yuanping to Beijing and points
east, and some will go to the Taiyuan area and east via the recently electri-
fied Taiyuan-Shijiazhuang line. Present traffic on the line ranges from 8 to
10 mt p.a. near Datong and Taiyuan to 5 mt p.a. through the central and more
mountainous section. In addition to freight, there are some 10-12 passenger
trains per day on the line, and the northern and southern sections are vir-
tually at capacity with their single track steam operation (7 to 10 mt p.a.).
4.07      There are major mining development projects about to start along the
northern section, and sustained growth of production is also expected along
the rest of the line. A detailed traffic forecast is given in Table 4.2. By
the mid-1990s, traffic is expected to exceed 30 mt p.a. on the northern
section, reach 19 mt p.a. on the southern section, and some 12 mt p.a. through
the mountains. The annual capacity of the line with the project for these
three sections will be respectively 33, 20, and 14 mt.
4.08      The benefits will again be mainly in terms of value added to coal
which will move on the line after its capacity is increased. Included in the



- 16 -
cost streams are the required investment in: (a) coal mines; (b) the proposed
project; (c) the improvement of the Datong-Beijing line; (d) the improvement
and new line construction between Beijing and Qinhuangdao; and (e) the new
coal terminal at Qinhuangdao port. The latter two items are presently under
construction with financial assistance from Japan, while work on the Datong-
Beijing line electrification is proceeding with the Government's own funds.
Some foreign investment is expected in the coal mines along the project
line. The economic rate of return of the entire set of investments above,
which include the proposed project, is estimated at 19% over a 25-year period
for benefits. Details are presented in Annex 5.
4.09      The alternative of providing the necessary capacity increase with
diesel rather than electric traction has been considered and rejected as more
costly. The analysis of the investment and operating costs for the electric
and diesel alternatives is given in Annex 5. Furthermore, the lines at both
ends of the proposed project are already electrified: Datong-Beijing in the
north and Taiyuan-Shijiazhuang in the south; so from an operating point of
view it also makes more sense to have the middle section under the same type
of traction.
D. Zhuzhou Locomotive Factory
4.10      This proposed component would assist the factory in increasing its
output to meet the overall demand for electric locomotives which will be
needed by the proposed project as well as other electrification projects
presently under construction. The proposed factory modernization will have
the following benefits:
(a) reduced production cost of locomotives resulting from more efficient
production methods, requiring less materials, labor and energy and
having fewer parts which need to be rejected or repaired;
(b) savings in the cost of locomotives (which otherwise would have to be
imported) resulting from an increase in production capacity from the
present 40 locomotives p.a. to 120 locomotives p.a.; and
(c) reduction in repair and maintenance costs of locomotives for the
operating railway administrations, due to the improved quality of
the locomotives which will be produced with the project.
4.11      The first year benefits are estimated at 95% of the investment costs
and the second year at almost twice the investment costs. The return of the
project is thus very high. This is because the project is a marginal
investment in a factory which is already established. A detailed economic
analysis with streams of costs and benefits is given in Annex 6.

E. Overall Evaluation and Risks
4.12      Overall economic evaluation shows that implementation of all project
components is well justified and should proceed without delay. The overall
ERR including the costs and benefits of the locomotive factory is estimated at
19%.
4.13      All project components involve proven technology that has been in
extended use in China or in other parts of the world; technological risks
connected with the project are therefore small. In addition, MR has success-
fully completed similar projects for a number of years and has competent
expertise; risks from inadequate project implementation and operation are
therefore negligible. The constraint placed on development by the tight
energy situation guarantees that all efforts will be made by the Government to
increase production of coal as well as develop the transport capacity to dis-
tribute it where needed. The risk is therefore very low that the rate of
return would fall below the estimate above. The sensitivity analysis for the
major project components is summarized below:

V. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
5.01      The four subadministrations directly concerned with the project
handle only about 7% of MR's traffic. Their financial results have conse-
quently only a minor effect on MR's overall financial performance which is
analyzed below.

Past Financial Performance
5.02      The profit and costs statements (income statements) of MR for the
period 1975-81 are given in Table 5.1. A summary follows:

Working ratio                 35       38       36      35       36       38       36
Operating ratio               57       61       61      59       59       73       72
5.03      Except for 1976 (effect of Cultural Revolution), sales revenue grew
steadily in line with traffic. Revenue per CTK was very stable, with an
income of Fen 1.22 per ton-km and Fen 1.46 per passenger-km. Revenue other
than that from freight and passengers was small, about 5% of total revenue; it
concerned essentially revenue from loading and unloading of freight cars and
terminal charges.
5.04      Working expenses also showed a stablea trend; they were unusually low
compared to revenue, resulting in an amazing working ratio of about 36%. The
main reasons for such a favorable result are that: (i) staff productivity is
high (581,000 CTK per employee in 1981); (ii) salaries represent only about
31% of working expenses, as compared to an average of 65% in other railways in
south and east Asia; and (iii) working expenses do not include the "major
repairs" expenses, for which a provision is made and included in the deprecia-
tion figures.



- 19 -
5.05      The main components of the working expenses are:
(a) salaries (31%), averaging since end-1981 a very low Y 830 per staff-
year. However, fringe benefits, such as productivity bonuses and
social advantages, increased the real cost per staff-year to Y 870;
(b) materials (25%), averaging a low Y 1.2 million per one billion CTK;
and
(c) fuel (30%), averaging about Y 1.5 million per one billion CTK on the
basis of the present distribution of motive power (75% steam, 22%
diesel, 3% electric in 1982).
5.06      Depreciation, calculated at 6.5% of depreciable gross fixed assets
in use may appear high, but includes a provision for major repairs (para.
2.14). Moreover, the asset values used are mostly historical book values.
The question of what would be a more satisfactory depreciation provision would
need further examination in the context of improvement of financial pro-
cedures. The operating ratio, which would be unaffected by the inclusion of
the provision for major repairs in either working expenses or in depreciation,
remained since 1980 at a favorable 72-73%.
5.07      Nonoperating expenses concerned essentially staff fringe benefits,
welfare, pension and education expenditure. Profit from subsidiaries is the
aggregated net profit from factories, shops, etc. These subsidiaries do not
include motive power and rolling stock factories which report to the Indus-
trial Department of MR.
5.08      The favorable working and operating ratios discussed above and the
substantial profit shown in the income accounts a priori suggest a high rate
of return. On the basis of the information obtained, MR's rate of return on
the estimated average net fixed assets in use for 1981 was 5.7%, a good
performance. However, it should be mentioned that the particulars of the
valuation and revaluation(s) of fixed assets are unknown. Historically, the
rate of inflation has been very low in China (less than 1% p.a. between 1952
and 1980). Nevertheless, the rate of return as assessed should be interpreted
with caution.
Future Financial Performance
5.09      The actual 1981, estimated 1982 and forecast 1983-87 income state-
ments in constant terms are shown in Table 5.2. Forecasts are based on the
assumption that traffic will grow as planned in the Sixth Five-Year Plan
1981-85, i.e., 6% p.a. in pass-km and 3.0% p.a. in ton-km. The criteria used
for forecasting revenue and costs are available in the Project File. A
summary of Table 5.2 follows.

Line A:  Assume that provision for major repairs is included in working costs.
Line B: Traditional MR handling of depreciation.
Two sets of working ratios and rates of return on average net fixed assets in use
are presented. The first set (Line A) is based on the assumption that the
provision for major repairs is included in working expenses. The second set
(Line B) is based on MR's traditional approach. Under option A (which seems more
logical for reasons explained in para. 2.14), the working ratio is expected to
improve from 54% in 1982-83 to 49% in 1984-85 as a result of the December 1,
1983, tariff increase and to deteriorate slightly thereafter. The rate of return
would increase from 6.5% in 1982 to 6.7% in 1983 and 8.8% in 1984 due to the
tariff increase, and to progressively decrease to 7.4% in 1987. This situation
stems from the substantial increase in net fixed assets which are expected to
rise from Y 47 billion in 1982 to Y 63 billion in 1987. As a result of MR's
comprehensive investment plan, the Railways' capacity will exceed the anticipated
demand during this period; hence a temporary lower utilization of the investments
and consequently a decline in the rate of return after 1984. However, all ratios
indicate that MR's financial position is expectecd to be better than that of most
railways in the world. Under MR's traditional approach to depreciation, the
working ratio is expected to improve from 36% in 1982-83 to 32% in 1984 and to
remain steady at about 33% thereafter. The operating ratio is expected to vary
from about 70% in 1982-83 to 62% in 1984, and to 66% in 1987, a very comfortable
level.



- 21 -
5.10      The profit delivery system - by which practically all cash generated
by MR was remitted to the State while the State financed all railway invest-
ments - has, through 1982, been highly profitable for the State. This situa-
tion is expected to continue under the recently introduced taxation system, as
shown in Table 5.3 and summarized below:
1981   1982   1983   1984   1985   1986   1987
(Y million)
Remittance to the State         5,167  5,781  5,946  7,315  7,464  7,614  7,806
State-financed investments    1,600  3,000  4,200  4,200  4,300  4,400  4,500
Net flow of funds to the
State                         3,567  2,781  1,746  3,112  3,164  3,214  3,306
During 1981-87, the gross flow of funds to the State is estimated at Y 47.1
billion as compared with State-financed investments of Y 26.2 billion, or 56%
of funds received; Wis leaves a comfortable cash balance of Y 20.9 billion in
favor of the State.-
5.11      Because of the peculiarities of Chinese accounting, the financial
relationship between State and MR, the handling of depreciation, and the new
taxation system, an attempt has been made to translate into notional western-
type income accounts the actual and forecast earnings position of MR, treating
major repairs as investment items (which may only be partly true) and assuming
depreciation at 4% of depreciable gross fixed assets (based on historical
asset values and including the new investments). The presentation is in
Tables 5.4 to 5.7. The exercise shows that MR would, during the period
1981-87:
(a)  maintain a good earnings position with working and operating ratios
of about 36 and 57, respectively, over 1981-83, and about 33 and 54
in 1987;
(b)  achieve an estimated rate of return of 9.2% in 1982-83, increasing
to 11.3% in 1984 and decreasing slightly to 10.3% in 1987;
(c)  generate sufficient cash to finance its investments and debt
service, while building up a substantial cash balance (Y 2.5
billion); and
1/   The calculations do not include:  (a) the very minor (0.7%) increase in
MR's 1981-87 investment costs due to the application of the Internal
Settlement Rate, (para. 3.12); and (b) the annual service of the proposed
Bank loan which at 11% interest over 20 years represents about Y 100
million.



- 22 -
(d)  pay to the State Y 41.4 billion in the form of sales tax, income tax
and shares in MR's profits.
Although notional, the exercise is based on MR's actual and forecast
parameters; it clearly illustrates the strong financial position of MR and its
creditworthiness as beneficiary of Bank funds.
5.12      The Ministry of Railways' financial situation is thus expected to
remain satisfactory, with little risk of deterioration in the medium term.
Agreement was reached at negotiations that MR would consult with the Bank:
(a) semi-annually on project financing and disbursments; and (b) annually on
the finances and financial performance of MR, its administrations and sub-
administrations concerned with the project. The consultations would be based
on the updated data concerning the railways' operations and finances as pub-
lished in various forms on a periodical basis, mainly in the China Statistical
Yearbook.
5.13      Audit.   At negotiations an assurance was obtained that audited
statements covering: (a) Profits and Cost and FuLnd Balance Statements covering
the subadministrations concerned with the project and the Zhuzhou factory; and
(b) an extract from the Improvement and Construction Fund Statement identi-
fying project financing and expenditure would be furnished to the Bank no
later than 6 months after the close of the fiscal year. Initially, the
Ministry of Finance will issue Audit Reports in accordance with methods and
procedures acceptable to the Bank until the new State Audit Agency (SAA) is in
a position to issue acceptable audit reports.
5.14      Project Completion Report.  Agreement was reached during negotia-
tions that MR will prepare a Project Completion Report covering both the
infrastructure and factory components of the project. This report should be
submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the loan closing date.
B. Project Subadministrations
5.15      As mentioned in para. 2.12, MR does not have recent traffic costing
information by line and commodities. Therefore, an analysis of the antici-
pated financial impact of the project on the two project lines is not possible
at this time. However, an analysis of the 1980-81 income statements of the
Datong and Taiyuan subadminstrations, which include the Datong-Taiyuan line
and of the Jinan and Xinxiang subadministrations, which include the Xinxiang-
Yanzhou line (Tables 5.8, 5.9 and 5.10), favor an expectation that the
economically justified project will also have a beneficial effect on the four
subadministrations, and thus on MR's financial performance.
5.16      The tables show that, in 1981, the Datong and Taiyuan subadmini-
strations achieved respective working and operating ratios of 39 and 67%, and
31 and 65%. The Jinan and Xinxiang subadministrations achieved an even better
performance with respective working and operating ratios of 30 and 63%, and 28
and 60%.  These ratios disclose substantial profits, but should be interpreted
with caution as the revenue figures used represent budgetary allocations by
MR, based on a general formula. These profits are likely to increase as a
result of project implementation since although gross operating revenue per



- 23 -
traffic unit is not expected to change substantially, operating unit costs are
expected to decline as the fixed costs are spread over a traffic three times
higher in 1986 (when the project is fully operational) than in 1981.
5.17      These projections are, however, somewhat tentative given the limited
cost data available. In fact, use of a cost per "traffic unit" suffers from
the disadvantages of ignoring the traffic characteristics of the passenger and
freight traffic services, and the nature of fixed and variable costs.
Improvements in costing and the case study under the proposed costing study
would enable MR to have a better measure of the likely future results (paras.
3.10, 5.19 and Annex 3).
C. Improvement of Financial Procedures
5.18      There is a need for updating and modernizing MR's financial
procedures to assist in its efforts to further improve the efficiency of the
railway system. This could best be done as part of a long-term, comprehensive
review of MR's financial procedures involving, inter alia, (a) long-term
financial objectives; (b) long-term financial planning; (c) budgeting;
(d) accounting; (e) cost accounting; (f) management information; and (g) data
processing. Implementation of such a financial procedures improvement program
would be spread over several years and would be supported through a number of
projects. During negotiations, it was agreed that MR's financial procedures
would be discussed annually in parallel with the discussions on the railways'
financial performance and situation.
5.19      The traffic costing study to be undertaken under the proposed
project is intended to be the first stage of this program. Details of the
arrangements for the conduct of the study as well as detailed terms of
reference (Annex 3) were settled at negotiations. The responsibility for the
traffic costing study will rest with MR. The Bank will assist MR in financing
study tours, staff training, technical assistance, and equipment.
D. The Zhuzhou Locomotive Factory
5.20      Implementation of the Zhuzhou locomotive factory component of the
proposed project is expected to increase the factory's production capacity,
improve productivity and consequently reduce unit production costs. This
reduction will further improve the already satisfactory financial performance
of the factory, as can be seen from Tables 5.11 (a)-(d), 5.12 and 5.13 which
show the factory's detailed and consolidated income statements, flows of funds
and summarized funds balance statement in actuals for 1981-82 and as forecast
over 1983-86. These tables are summarized hereafter.

reflected in a 69% increase in working capital after payment of income tax and

the State's share in the factory's profits over 1982-86. During this same
period, net fixed assets and the net worth of the factory will more than
double. Implementation of the project will consequently be highly beneficial.
5.22      As for the railways, this first project should provide the starting
point for a constructive dialogue between the factory's management at both the
MR and local levels and the Bank, on ways and means to further improve the
factory's financial planning, accounting, cost accounting, and management
information system. These improvements would help management to closely plan
and monitor productivity, detect inadequacies and take corrective action
leading to increased profitability. Exchanges of views on the improvement of
the factory's financial and cost analysis procedures should coincide with
periodical discussions on its financial results referred to in para. 5.12 and
on locomotive production costs. Agreement on this was reached at negotia-
tions.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During loan negotiations, agreements or assurances were obtained on
the following:
(a)  details, timing and terms of reference of a comprehensive railway
traffic costing study (paras. 3.10, 5.19, and Annex 3);
(b)  submission of annual audit reports covering (i) MR subadministra-
tions and administrations concerned with the project; (ii) the
Zhuzhou locomotive factory; and (iii) project expenditures (para.
5.13); and
(c)  consultation with the Bank on project expenditures and on the
finances, financial performance and financial procedures of MR and
its subadministrations concerned with the project, and the Zhuzhou
factory (paras. 5.12, 5.18 and 5.22).
6.02      Subject to the above agreements, the proposed project is a suitable
basis for a Bank loan of US$220 million to the People's Republic of China.
This amount includes the front-end fee of 0.25% totalling about US$0.5
million, which will be capitalized. The loan would be for a term of 20 years
including a 5-year grace period, at the standard variable rate.

CHINA
RAILWAY PROJECT
Project Description
1.        The project comprises the following parts:
(a)  Capacity increase infrastructure works on the Xinxiang-Heze-Yanzhou
line;
(b)  Capacity increase infrastructure works on the Datong-Taiyuan line;
(c)  Modernization of the locomotive factory in Zhuzhou; and
(d) Technical assistance and training for the factory staff (see
Annex 2).
A. Xinxiang-Heze-Yanzhou Line
2.        Present Situation.  Today, there is no direct rail connection
betwen Xinxiang and Heze. From Heze to Yanzhou the existing line (which
was built using mostly second-hand rails and ties on a thin ballast bed)
has an operational capacity of only about 4 million net tons per year.
Proposed Improvements
3.        In order to fill the gap, five subprojects will be implemented.
They are:
(a)  building rail connections to the existing network in the
Xinxiang area;
(b)  building of a new line between Xinxiang and Heze;
(c) on this section, building a 10 km bridge over the Yellow River;
(d)  upgrading the existing line between Heze and Yanzhou, and
(e)  building rail connections to the existing network in the
Yanzhou area.



ANNEX 1
-27 -                            Page 2
4.        Xinxiang Connections.  Xinxiang is a busy rail center, at the
junction of the main Beijing-G'uangzhou line (double track) and the Yueshan
line (double tracking under construction). When the eastern connection to
Heze and the Yellow Sea is built, total traffic passing and marshalled in
Xinxiang will exceed the present limited capacity of the station and yard.
The cost of expanding the facilities in their present location would be
prohibitive. Therefore, an additional station and yard will be built 4.6 km
south of Xinxiang and a new 8.7 km track will link the new installations to
the existing Yueshan line. The new line to Heze will start from
Xinxiang-south. To cope with increasing traffic, the locomotive depot will
be expanded.
5.        Xinxiang-Heze New Line.  This will be a 165 km long single track,
with the following characteristics:
-   maximum gradient:  0.4%
-   minimum curve radius:  800 m
-   effective loop length:  850 m, expandable to 1,050 m
-   relay, semi-automatic signalling
-   50 kg/m rails
-   1,760 concrete ties per km.
-   steam traction, 3,500 ton trains
-   design capacity:  22 million tons per year
The terrain between Xinxiang and Heze is flat. Near the Yellow River, some
earthworks are needed but the track will only be one to two meters above the
rest of the land. Generally speaking, this is a very simple piece of civil
works.
Yellow River Bridge (Map IBRD 1709R)
6.        The limits of this major bridge/trestle structure are in the area
of Dongzhaodi at the west abutment and Xibaocheng at the east abutment, -rhere
the railroad will pass just south of Dongming. While the overall length of
the bridge is in excess of 10 km, only about 1.6 km of bridge length is over
the permanent river bed. On the western side, the remainder is (a) over a
five-km land area which is normally cultivated, but occasionally flooded, and
(b) over the normal flood plain of about three km between the high hazard
flood dikes and the main river channel. Also, a small area of flood plain,
about 0.6 km, will be bridged just to the east of the main river channel.
7.        The bridge structure itself is of a classic design in its main
elements, and of a rather modern design in the selection of some of the
structural materials and section shapes in the approach superstructure.



ANNEX 1
- 28 -                           Page 3
Between thewest abutment and station W0010, prestressed concrete "T" type deck
girder spans will be built over an agricultural area. Each of these simply
supported concrete spans will be 32.7 m long.   Between station  W0110 and
the main channel, over agricultural land and the hazardous flood plain, 100
spans of structural steel deck plate girders will be utilized. Each of the
simply supported spans will be 40.7 m long. Over the Yellow River main
channel, the design is a traditional structural steel through truss of the
modified double Warren type. Nine of the trlss spans over the western side
of the main channel are simple spans of 90 m each, followed by two series of
continuous through steel trusses of the same modified double Warren design.
The first is a four-span unit and the second a three-span unit, both with
individual 108 m long spans.  Between the maiLn channel and the eastern dike
and up to the eastern abutment, 19 prestressed concrete deck girder spans will
be used, each 32 m long.
8.        The "T" section deck prestressed. concrete approach spans are
rather modern in design and considered to be quite effective.   These make an
economic superstructure while providing sufficient strength and safety. They
have been used safely for about 20 years around the world and are considered
an excellent selection. Further, they afford the possibility of utilizing a
ballasted deck at least for about 40% of the structure length. On a railway
bridge, a ballasted deck provides for easier track maintenance without the
problems associated with individual bridge timbers. The steel spans (both
truss and girder), while traditional, are an excellent and safe selection;
they have been used around the world for over a century.
9.        The substructure consists of a variety of reinforced concrete and
steel shell concrete pier stems essentially of the hammerhead or "T" pier
type, but using a series of stem shapes depending on location in and out of
the water, and dimensional changes to reflect variable pier height and
relative economics of construction. Further, the founding base is formed as
a caisson for the river piers, while drilled piles are selected to found the
greater number of approach span pier foundations.
10.       Piers at the water's edge are reinforced concrete open caissons.
Piers in the water are open caissons on steel shells, concrete filled in the
lower portions. A variety of configurations for the cells in the open
caissons were selected for maximum utilization of materials stress, and
therefore maximum economy.   Single circular section hammerhead columns
form a stem which is constructed atop the caisson base and is further topped
by a pier cap long enough to pick up the bearings of the trusses. Piers for
the approach spans are essentially of hammerhead configuration, but vary to
full stem width as necessary to reflect the structural requirements that
correspond to variable height. They consist of pile foundations topped by a
footing of reinforced concrete upon which is placed a reinforced concrete
stem of variable sectional configuration. The stem is further topped by a
reinforced concrete pier cap which is long enough to pick up the steel plate
girders or prestressed concrete "T" sections. The pier types are conven-
tional, having been used hundreds of times around the world. They are
considered both economic and safe.



ANNEX 1

11.       MR considered several possible alignments (see map IBRD 17097R).
The two northernmost, although slightly less expensive to build, were not
retained because of flooding over a 10 year cycle. The flood gate between
Zhanglindun and Qucun is opened during the 10 year major floods, which would
partly destroy six to nine km of track, west of the river. The third
alignment studied did not present this danger but crosses the permanent river
bed where it is relatively wide, thus increasing the cost of the major steel
spans of the bridge. The fourth alignment studied, shown in red on the map,
was selected. It passes south of Dongming and results in the longest overall
structure. However, the major steel spans are shorter, as is the total track
length. The location of the track outside the limits of the dikes is on a
terrain which is very unlikely to be washed away, even under extreme flooding.
12.       When the bridge location and design were examined during
appraisal, the alternative of building a double track bridge was discussed.
The Major Bridge Design Institute of MR had costed and rejected this alter-
native as not economically justified. As a consequence of further
discussions with the Bank team, another solution was eventually adopted:
building a crossing loop on the western access to the main bridge. This
will reduce the critical section length from about 14 to less than 8 km,
increasing line capacity from 17 to 22 mpty, at a relatively modest cost.
At the location of the crossing loop, the bridge width will be doubled for
the two track alignment. The deck structure will consist of multiple
parallel prestressed concrete "T" sections. This arrangement will be
carried over 38 spans, or a distance of 1.25 km, at the end of which the
structure will return to single track width.
13.       Upgrading the Heze-Yanzhou Line.  The present characteristics of
this line are as follows:
-   single line
-   maximum gradient: 0.4%
-   minimum curve radius:  800 m
-   effective loop length:  650 m expandable to 850 m.
-   relay, semi-automatic signalling
-   40 and 43 kg/m second hand rails
-   used wooden ties
-   steam traction, 2,700 ton trains; 3,300 ton trains between
Jining and Yanzhou.
-   13 intermediate stations



ANNEX 1
-30-                             Page 5
-    between Heze and Jining:  59 bridgtes including one to be rebuilt;
-    between Jining and Yanzhou:  27 bridges, 26 of which to be rebuilt.
This section will be upgraded to bring it to the same standard as the new
Xinxiang-Heze section (para. 5. preceding), which is also the standard adopted
for the neighboring section from Yanzhou to Shijiusuo, presently under
construction. The same train will therefore run between Xinxiang and
Shijiusuo, without intermediate marshalling.
14.       Yanzhou Connections.  The situation in Yanzhou (on the main
Beijing-Shanghai double-track line) is similar to that in Xinxiang. With the
additional coal traffic coming from the west and continuing east to Shijiusuo,
once the Xinxiang-Heze line is built, the present station and yard will no
longer be adequate. A new facility will be built south of Yanzhou, where the
two new western and eastern sections will be connnected.
B. Datong-Taiyuan Line
15.       Geographical Setting.  This line can be divided in six sections
of different characteristics:
(a)  Datong-Pingwang (12 km):  double track, part of the Datong area
territory.
(b)  Pingwang-Shuo Xian (118 km):  single track on a relatively flat
terrain, with embankments less than, 2 m high.
(c)  Shuo Xian-Yuanping (97 km):  single track on a rugged terrain,
including the 3.3 km long Duanjialing tunnel through the
Hengshan mountain near the Fenghuancun station.
(d)  Yuanping-Huanghouyuan (108 km):  single track except for 7 km
between Taihe and Beibai where it is double. Generally flat
terrain except in the areas of the Hutuo and Fin Rivers.
(e)  Huanghouyuan-Taiyuan-North (10 km):  single track, flat terrain
in suburban areas.
(f)  Taiyuan-North-Taiyuan (10 km):  double track in the Taiyuan area
territory.
16.       Present line Conditions.  Other characteristics are as follows;
-   maximum gradients:
Datong-Shuo Xian: 0.6%
Shuo Xian-Yuanping: 2.2%
Yuanping-Taiyuan: 1.2%



ANNEX 1

Curves:  228 (62.7 km total) including three (2.7 km in total) of
250 m radius
effective crossing loop lengths:  650 m
relay, semi-automatic signalling, color light signals
large and medium bridges:  34 (2,640 m in total)
small bridges and culverts:  541
tunnels:  13 (5,861 m in total)
43 kg/m rails on 1,600-1,760 wooden ties/km
open wire communications
17.       Proposed Infrastructure Improvements
-   double the track between Pingwang and Shuo Xian (118 km) and
between Fenghuangeun and Changzhen (9 km)
-   extend the length of the crossing loops 'from 650 to
850 m (34 places)
-   add four 850 m crossing loops on the single track section of the
line
-   strengthen 21 large and medium bridges
-   strengthen 397 small bridges and culverts
-   enlarge two tunnels
18.       Electrification Works.
-   electrify the whole line, 355 route-km or about 540 track-km in
25 KV-50 Hz, the standard already used elsewere in China
-   lay an underground cable for communications and signalling
-   upgrade the signalling system to CTC with cab signals
19.       Operations after the Project. Compared with the present 1,400 ton
trainsnorthbound and 1,500 ton trains southbound, future trains will all be
3,000 tons between Yuanping and Taibei. Single locomotives will be used
between Datong and Shuo Xian (0.6% gradients), double heading between Yuanping
and Taiyuan (1.2% gradients) and triple heading between Shuo Xian and Yuanping
(2.2% gradients).

C. Modernization of the Zhuzhou Factory
20.       In order to more than double electric locomotive production by
1986/87, some workshops will be expanded. The main thrust, however, is to
equip existing workshops with more modern machine-tools to increase
production, reduce rejects and provide adequate quality control. A number of
high productivity numerically-controlled machiine tools will be purchased, some
with microprocessor control. An extensive training program is planned (Annex
2) to enable the factory staff to use and maintain this new production
equipment.

CHINA
RAILWAY PROJECT
Technical Assistance and Training
(Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Factory)
1.        Four packages of combined technical assistance and training are
included in this project. The first three address specific training needs
identified during project preparation and appraisal. The fourth package was
identified in July 1983, during discussions with a panel of international
experts in electric locomotive design and manufacture, which visited China in
relation with the identification/preparation of a second railway project.
The purpose of these training packages is described below. Training sched-
ules and detailed cost estimates are presented at the end of this Annex.
2.        General Training.  There is a need for foremen and skilled workers
to be exposed to technology, methods and procedures used abroad. This is the
case for several technical areas of the Zhuzhou factory and is the result of
long years of isolation during which only sporadic contacts were possible
between Chinese and foreign technicians. Training will be in the following
areas:
(a)  Electric locomotive technology:
- welding
- heat treatment
- die design and technology
- electronics
(b) Electric locomotive design and testing:
- thyristor converters
-  adhesion utilization
-  testing techniques
-  locomotive dynamics
-  failure diagnosis
-  noise control



34 -                          ANNEX 2
Page 2
(c) Computer applications:
- computer-aided design
- micro-processor applications
- electronic data processing
- NC machine tool programming
(d) Traction motors and electrical equipment:
- traction motor technology
- F/H class insulation
- reliability testing
- air and vacuum circuit breakers
- main transformers
(e) Semi-conductor devices
(f) Scientific research management
A total of 18 man-years has been set aside for this basic training.
Individual programs will be arranged taking package #4 (para. 5 following)
into consideration, so as to avoid duplication.
3.        T.A./Training Related to Production Equipment.  Part of the
proceeds of the proposed loan will finance some production equipment tech-
nologically more advanced than that presently in use in the Zhuzhou factory.
Some numerically-controlled or micro-computer assisted machine tools are not
yet produced in China. Operator training is essential if the benefits of
this investment are to materialize. The following program was therefore
decided:
(a)  MNC milling and boring machine:              2 operators,  12 mm
(b)  Digital display jig grinder:                 1 operator,    6 mm
(c)  MNC C02 laser cutting machine:               2 operators,  12 mm
(d)  Axle box transfer line:                      1 expatriate,  4 mm
(e)  Friction screw press:                        2 operators,  12 mm
(f)  Transformer lamination machine:              2 operators,  12 mm
(g)  Vertical plate bending machine:              2 operators,  12 mm
(h)  Automatic cable cutting machine:             1 operator      6 mm



-35 -                            ANNEX 2
Page 3
(i) Cable cutting, stripping and crimping
machine:                                   1 operator,    6 mm
(j)  Feedback test bench:                         3 operators,  18 mm
(k)  Computer system:                             4 operators,  24 mm
In all, 20 operators will be trained abroad for about six months each, and one
foreign expert will teach and train local operators for a)out four months.
4.        T.A./Training Related to R&D Equipment.  This package is basically
designed in the same manner as the previous one, but deals with a different
set of equipment to be used by a different group of operators.  The program is
as follows:
(a)  Traction motor/bogie vibration bench:        4 operators,  24 mm
+ 2 experts,      6 mm
(b)  CAD/CAM/CAE systems:                         2 operators,  12 mm
+ i expert,       2 mm
(c)  Data processing:                             1 operator,    6 mm
(d)  Combined environmental test chamber:         2 operators,   9 mm
+ 1 expert,       2 mm
(e)  Instruments and other equipment:             1 operator,    6 mm
In all, 10 operators will be trained abroad for a total of 57 man-months,
while four foreign experts will train R&D operators for a total of ten
man-months.
5.        Specialized Training.  The panel of electric locomotive experts
which visited Zhuzhou in July 1983 identified the need for training in
several specific fields. Generally, this package addresses higher level
staff, i.e. plant manager or assistant manager, specialized workshop
managers, trainers, etc. most of whom have college education or equivalent
experience. The training will be for:
(a) Production organization and manage-
ment                                       4 trainees,   24 mm
+ 2 experts,      6 mm
(b)  Welding technology                           2 trainees,   24 mm
+ 3 experts,      9 mm
(c)  NC machine tools
-  programming:                           4 trainees,   36 mm
- maintenance:                            2 trainees,   12 mm
(d)  Cabling technology:                          2 trainees,   12 mm
(e)  Electronic technology:                       1 expert,       3 mm
(f)  To be determined later:                      1 trainee,      9 mm
+ 2 experts,      6 mm



-36 -                           ANNEX 2
Page 4
This package is thus composed of 15 trainees going abroad for a total of 117
man-months, while eight experts would visit Zhuzhou for a total of 24 man-
months.
6.        Programming and Cost Estimates.  The timing of the various training
phases has been arranged on a preliminary basis. For the equipment-related
training, the trainees would visit the supp]ier's plant or other factories
where similar equipment is used, and only later would the foreign experts
come to China, to complete the training on site. The total program amounts
to 548 man-months of Chinese trainees abroad, plus 38 man-months of foreign
experts in China. The total cost is estimated at about US$1.3 million, on
the following basis:

CHINA
RAILWAY PROJECT
Proposed Railway Traffic Costing Study
Terms of Reference
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
1.        The Ministry of Railways (MR) is by far the major transport carrier
in China. It has a high level of operating efficiency and has been generating
substantial financial surpluses. However, the procedures and techniques for
cost analysis need to be reviewed and updated to make cost information more
reliable and timely, and helpful to MR management. Improving and
strengthening railway costing management would be of great importance to:
(a) evaluating railway operational performance;
(b) deciding on investment and network size, taking into consideration
the most economic transport mode for passenger and freight traffic;
(c) changing operational procedures and/or introducing new technology;
(d) deciding among traffic/services options;
(e)  deciding on tariff structures and levels in relation to costs.
SCOPE
2.        To update and improve its costing system, MR intends to undertake a
study. The aim of the study will be to improve the costing methodology and
thereafter install a costing system that will help improve railway operations
and management. The methodology and cost concepts outlined in Appendix 1 can
be taken as a reference in the study. As a case study, a subadministration may
be chosen and costing of coal carried on the Datong-Taiyuan line with and
without project investments would be conducted.
3.        Development of costs generally varies among costing systems,
depending upon the types of output and services. After pre-processing,
specific and unit costs would be developed, irLcluding single car movements,
unit trains, branch lines or particular passenger services.
STAGES OF STUDY DEVELOPMENT
4.        Implementation of a study for an improved railway costing system is
expected to take several years, especially since some adjustment/adaptation of
the costing system after an initial period is often necessary. The study is
therefore envisaged to be carried out in the following phased manner:



39 -                         ANNEX 3
Page 2
(a)  prepare, starting September 1, 1984, a description of the existing
methodology for railway traffic costing. Estimated duration - four
months;
(b) on the basis of surveys and investigations in China and abroad, to
start January 1, 1985, develop an outline of a revised costing
system. Estimated duration - one year. In developing this outline,
data format and processing requirements should be designed so that
computerization of the system can be accomplished;
(c) review, starting January 1, 1986, the need for adapting the
expenditure titles of accounts and the operational/statistical
system to the revised costing system. Estimated duration - four to
six months;
(d) undertake, by July 1, 1986, the data collection and develop specific
and unit costs for intermediate work units. Estimated duration -
one year. These activities may be limited to one subadministration
initially, to test the suitability of the data format and costing
system revisions;
(e) conduct, starting July 1, 1987, a case study of the costs of coal
transportation on the Datong-Taiyuan project line. Estimated
duration - one year;
(f) starting July 1, 1988, revise the costing system to remedy possible
deficiencies disclosed by the case study. Estimated duration - 3 4
months;
(g) starting January 1, 1989, draft costing manuals and draw up a
program for fully implementing the revised costing system on the
whole railway network; and
(h) undertake training of staff as appropriate for the different phases
listed above.
The study will be completed by December 31, 1989. The above dates may be
amended by agreement between the Borrower and the Bank.
5.        The study will be carried out by a Study Team (ST) to be organized
by MR. The ST would be staffed with representatives of MR administrations and
subadministrations and institutes and/or universities to take joint charge of
the Study.
REPORTING AND CONSULTATION
6.        After the completion of each of the stages (a) to (g) of para. 4
above, reports would be prepared. A copy of these reports would be furnished
to the World Bank within one month of their issuance for exchange of views
with the ST and MR.

METHODOLOGY
1.        Costing systems usually concentrate on tracing the relationship from
costs of factor inputs to costs of intermediate work units, and hence costs of
traffic, i.e., of output provided to users. Estimation of the costs of
intermediate work units, often called unit costs, involves the resolution of
the question of joint costs. At all times, however, the costing analysis
concerns itself with understanding the underlying physical process, and with
defining and measuring the physical process.
2.        The first step in cost analyses is to pre-process data:  aggregate
various related accounts, normalize data, and identify certain expenses to be
incurred. Thereafter, the causal relationships underlying costs are to be
traced out. This is usually done by direct assignment, statistical procedures
like regression analysis, and engineering and specific studies to identify
synthetic exploratory variables.
COST CONCEPTS
CAUSAL COST
3.        Any railway resource or asset can be put to work in different
productive concepts. Thus, their use in one situation precludes their use
elsewhere and the alternative goods and services that could have been produced
are sacrificed. For example, the offering of a new service requires capital
plant and equipment to be put in place, operated, and maintained for operating
this service. The decision to offer a new or amended service (or to continue
an existing service) causes alternatives to be foregone. The concept of
causal costs is consequently essential.
4.        The concept of causal costs as applied to railway is complicated by
the nature of railway operations. A railway serves many types of traffic and
many origin - destination pairs simultaneously. Thus a railway produces a
large number of specific outputs: time specific, place specific, and traffic
type specific. In practice, individual movements are integrated into 'blocks'
of traffic or services, and these are treated as if they were homogeneous.  The
degree of aggregation will depend on the question being asked, i.e., the
decision to be made. In theory, there are many levels of disaggregation at
which costing can be carried out. However, in practice, operational systems
which calculate costs at one or two levels of detail generally suffice. The
interpretation of causal cost changes according to the level of disaggregation
chosen; e.g., single car load movement, at train level, entire service (e.g.,
passenger traffic, coal traffic or operation of specific lines).
5.        A railway produces multiple outputs and it is often difficult to
causally trace cost relationships to one output rather than another. For
example, a number of services and types of traffic use the same roadway,
signalling and switching facilities. The costs associated with these elements
are 'common' to the various outputs. Clearly, the greater the level of
aggregation of output of service, the less the magnitude of common costs.

APPENDIX 1
Page 2
FIXED AND VARIABLE COSTS
6.        Costs specific to a single type of output may be categorized into
those that are fixed and those that are 'avoidable' or 'variable'. Variable
cost is defined as that part of the total cost which would be avoidable if
output were reduced to zero. The term 'incremental' cost is sometimes used -
this is defined as the extra cost associated with a unit or block of output.
Incremental cost thus depends on the existing level of output, to which the
additional output must be added (or from which it would be subtracted). Costs
may increase linearly with output or nonlinearly. The term 'avoidable' cost
may be used to cover both linear and nonlinear variable costs.
7.        Just as costs specific to a single type of output may be divided
into those that are fixed and those that are avoidable, so costs which are
joint to several outputs may be divided into those that are fixed and those
that are avoidable - i.e., into fixed common costs and avoidable common
costs. Thus four categories of costs can be distinguished: avoidable service
specific costs, avoidable common costs, fixed service specific costs, and
fixed common costs. Clearly the more detailed the services to be costed, the
more costs will be common. In practice, in rail costing, the problem of
common costs is bypassed by defining intermediate processes to match plant and
equipment and analyzing the fixed and avoidable components.
SHORT AND LONG RUN COSTS
8.        Just as the demarcation between common and specific costs depends on
the level of aggregation, so in part the demarcation between fixed and
avoidable costs depends upon the time horizon addressed by the cost
analysis. In the very short run, few components would vary with traffic. As
the relevant time frame increases, fewer decisions are unchangeable and fewer
resources are firmly committed. In the longer run, facilities can be
expanded, contracted or modified to meet the needs of the traffic. The costs
of the facilities, both ownership and operating, vary with output. Hence a
distinction is necessary between the long run and the short run, where the
costs in the long run are those that result when inputs are adjusted to
change. The choice of the long run are those that result when inputs are
adjusted to change. The choice of long run or short run costs will depend
upon the specific application. For example, in a dynamic context, where new
investments are needed, the relevant cost will be different from a situation
in which traffic is short run in nature and uses spare capacity.
9.        Costs can thus be categorized in three different ways, i.e., along
three different dimensions: whether they are fixed vs. avoidable, whether
they are specific to a service vs. joint over several services; whether they
are operating costs specific to a time period vs. capital costs joint over
time.
10.       Costs relevant to decision-making are 'future' costs based on an
adequate understanding of past costs and trends, operating features/projected
operating and other conditions (including technological changes, changes in
price levels, etc.).

DATA BASE
11.       The principal sources of data from which relevant costs can be
determined are the railway's system of accounts and the railway's operational
and traffic statistics which provide the details of the work units. In
general, the accounting system should be suffic:Lently detailed and the expense
accounts classified according to 'natural' expense categories (labor, material
and other) and also according to function or intermediate process or
activity. The breakdown and the grouping of accounts would vary according to
the particular railway circumstances. Operating statistics reflect the
intermediate processes or activities undertaken by the railway; traffic
statistics reflect the final output of the railway.

PAILWAY PROJECT
Economic Evaluation of the Xinxiang-Yanzhou Line
Project Capital Costs
1.        The development of a conversion factor for the project capital
costs is shown in Table 1.
2.        The resultant conversion factor for the project is 0.97, rounded
to 1.00. The same factor will be applied to the capital cost of the
Yanzhou-Shijiusuo new line construction.
Other Capital Costs
3.        The proposed project line is part of a system of coal production
and distribution. The benefits are in terms of value added of the coal
which will be using the line. They have to be spread over the whole set of
investments required in coal production and distribution. These are the
following:
(a)  Coal Mine Development Costs.  These are assumed at US$100/ton, on
the basis of estimates of development costs used in the proposed
Bank Coal Project. This is on the high side since some of the
increased production will also come from extension of existing
mines at lower cost. Also, there is present mining capacity
which cannot be used for lack of rail capacity. Mine development
is assumed to take five years with the following annual
distribution of investments in percent: 10, 15, 30, 30, and 15.
The cost stream is shown in Table 2.
(b)  Yanzhou-Shijiusuo Line.  The estimated cost is Y 900 million.  The
conversion factor is 1.00 (para. 2).  It is estimated that
about one third of the traffic on this line will come from the
project line.
(c)  Shijiusuo Port.  The estimated cost is Y 710 million.  The con-
version factor is 1.08 (assimilated to the bridge, culvert, and
building factor, see footnote /b Table 1). It is also estimated
that about one third of the coal traffic through this port will
come from the project line.

/a  For the three traded commodities, steel, timber and cement the prices are
based on recent import contracts and reflect f.o.b. prices suitably adjusted

/b Land: The domestic price for land is 66,000 Yuan/ha. This is very high as
it includes some funds for relocation of the displaced population. If any-
thing,the domestic price overstates the opportunity cost of this land in
agriculture,generally estimated between Y 5,000 and 10,000/ha.  Labor:  The
conversion factor of 0.5 was applied as most construction labor is
unskilled. A factor of one would have brought the overall conversion factor
from 0.97 to 1.03. Other Materials: These are for the most part construc-
tion materials at least for the four civil work categories listed separ-
ately. For subgrade and track laying the following assumptions were made as

* From Annex II of "Economic Analysis of Aluminum Milling in Shanghai" (EAAMS)
by Shinji Ichishima and Adrian Wood, updated to 1983 prices (EAAMS)
For bridges, culverts and buildings, the construction factor derived in EAAMS
was used, i.e. 1.08. Other materials were assimilated to machinery as they
are essentially manufactured products, and a factor of 1.34 was used also
from EEAMS. Mechanical Equipment: For imported equipment, the prices
reflect f.o.b. prices suitably adjusted for inland traLnsport. For domestic
equipment, the EAAMS machinery conversion factor is applied,
Sources:  MR,October 1982 and mission estimates.  Cost estimates have been
revised since, but this does not substantially affect the above distribution
which is used only to determine a conversion factor. Final estimates
including physical contingencies are used for IERR calculations in
Table 3.

Project Benefits
4.        Benefits are in terms of value added to the coal produced and
transported in the system described above. The border (f.o.b. Chinese
port) price for coal used in the proposed Bank coal project ranges from
US$49 per ton in 1986 to US$56 in 1995 (expressed in mid-1983 prices) and
increasing at 1% p.a. thereafter. The estimated production cost is US$15
per ton (Y30/ton) including preparation before shipment. Some of the coal
using the project line is likely to be of lesser quality than the above, but
production cost will also be considerably less since much coal for domestic
consumption in China is still shipped without preparation. Therefore, the
difference is likely to be of the same order. The transport and handling
costs to east coast ports have been estimated conservatively at Y 16 per
ton; rail cost - 800 km x 0.8 fen/ton km = Y 6.4/ton; and port costs between
Y 7 and 10/ton. On the basis of costing information available, the shadow
economic price of rail freight is equal to the actual price. In conclusion,
the net value added for coal using the project line is taken as 98-30-16
= Y 52/ton in 1986 and Y 66/ton in 1985 growing at 1% p.a. thereafter.

Sensitivity and Risk Analysis
6.        The main risks of the project are:  Project cost overrun, delay in
generated coal traffic and lower price for coal. Another area of uncertainty
is mine development costs. The sensitivity of the IERR to these factors has
been tested as follows:

2.        The resultant conversion factor for the project is 0.99 rounded to
1.00. This is slightly higher than for the Xinxiang-Yanzhou line since there
is proportionally less earthworks and more materials, in particular for
electrification, but the difference is insignificant. The same factor is
applied to the other projects which constitute the system of coal production
and distribution described in para. 3 below.
Other Capital Costs
3.        Remarks made about the coal production and distribution system in
para. 3 of Annex 4 also apply to this line.
system are:
(a)  Coal Development Costs:  Assumed at US$100/ton (see Annex 4,
para. 3). Included here are the development costs related to the
generated traffic on the project line, i.e., the traffic above the
capacity of the line without the project. Mine development is
assumed to take five years with the following annual distribution
of investments in percent of total cost:  10, 15, 30, 30, and 15.
The cost streams are shown in Table 2.

(b)  Datong-Beijing:  The estimated cost is Y 390 million.  The capacity
of the line will be increased by 18 mjillion tons from 42 to 60.
Coal generated along the Datong-Taiyuan project line would use about
half of this capacity.
(c)  Beijing-Qinhuangdao line:  The estimated cost is Y 1,538 million.
This line will add 60 million ton capacity to the system; coal
generated along the project line wouldl use no more than one tenth
of this capacity.
(d)  Qinhuangdao Port Expansion:  The estimated cost is Y 360 million;
at most half of the 15 million ton capacity may be used for coal
generated by the project line.

Sensitivity and Risk Analysis
6.         The main risks of the project are:  Project cost overrun, delay in
generated coal traffic and lower price for coal. Another area of uncertainty
is mine development costs. The sensitivity of the IERR to these factors has
been tested as follows:

Electric Versus Diesel Operation
7.        While the project is well justified economically as demonstrated
above, it is also the least-cost solution. Table 4 compares the cost of
electrification versus dieselization of the project line.
8.        The assumptions made in Table 4 are as follows:
(a) Electrification Costs: include the cost of electrification
proper and also the total cost of signalling and
telecommunications which is a very conservative assumption.
(b) Locomotive Costs: In China, electric locomotives are rated at
5,600 hp while the freight diesels are rated at 3,300 hp or a
ratio of 1.7:1.0. A more conservative ratio of 1.5:1.0 has been
used in this analysis to reflect a more traditional ratio in other
countries. The number of locomotives needed is:

The locomotive price has been adjusted according to the economic
cost of production as calculated in Annex 6 for electric
locomotives,after improvement of the factory. The same factor has
been applied to the diesel locomotive price which assumes that some
improvement in manufacturing diesels would also occur.
Price       Econom:ic cost
- _________    (y)  ___-______
Electric       1,250,000       1,065,500
Diesel         1,450,000       1,232,500
(c) Fuel Costs. The following consumption and fuel costs have been
used:
Electric 235 kWh/10,000 CTK @ Y 0.09/kWh
Diesel     55  kg/10,000 CTK e Y  671/ton
Note: CTK - converted ton km where 1 ton km = 1 pass. km.
Domestic fuel prices are: electricity - Y 0.08/kWh and diesel -
Y 300/ton.
(d)  Operating Staff Costs:  Y 8,500 p.a. per locomotive.
(e)  Locomotive Maintenance Costs:  Electric - Y 37,705 per locomotive
p.a.; diesel - Y 52,817 per locomotive p.a.
This is very favorable to the diesel case with a ratio of diesel
to electric maintenance cost of 1.4:1. A more common ratio is 2-
3:1.
(f) Catenary Maintenance Costs: Y 4.87 million p.a.
The analysis has been limited to the first 15 years of operation,
corresponding to the life cycle of diesel locomotives. Again this
assumption is favorable to diesel since electric locomotives have a longer
life, and the line electrification works also. A residual value could be
attributed to the capital costs of electrification but in view of the high
rate of return without such values the exercise would not add to the case
for electrification.

Project Benefits
2.        The economic cost of producing one locomotive with and without the
project has been estimated on the basis of a detailed cost breakdown
provided by the factory. CIF prices have been used for tradable goods after
due adjustment for inland transport costs. Taxes have been excluded. A
conversion factor of 4 was applied to designers and supervisors and a factor
of 1 was applied to production workers. For parts purchased domestically, a
factor of 1.34 was applied. This is the factor developed for "non-traded

machinery and equipment" in "Economic Analysis of Aluminum Milling in
Shanghai." Detailed calculations are in the Project File; the results are
summarized below:
PRODUCTION COST FOR ONE LOCOMOTIVE
(Y '000)
Without     With         Cost
project    project      saving
Domestic price        1,087.9       943.9       144.0
Economic cost         1,272.1    1,065.5        206.6
Conversion factor        1.17        1.13
3.        Without the project, the plant capacity is 40 locomotives per year;
with the project it will be 120 locomotives per year. The cost of an imported
locomotive would be about US$1.5 million (Yuan 3 million); and the cost saving
per locomotive would be Y 1,934,500.
4.        In addition to the saving in manufacturing costs, the project will
also improve the quality of the locomotives and therefore reduce their
maintenance costs. MR has estimated that the average maintenance interval
would increase from 1 to 1.2 million km; and that the maintenance cost would
be reduced by 10%.  Average annual maintenance costs are about Y 13,000 per
locomotive. A 10% saving would amount to Y 1,300 per loco/year or a saving of
Y 52,000 p.a. for the 40 locomotives produced annually without the project.
Internal Economic Rate of Return
5.        The cost and benefit streams for the project are given in Table 1.
The return is very large (89%) since, in the first year of full operation with
the project, benefits will be almost twice the investment cost.
Sensitivity and Risk
6.        The investment will be repaid in one year, therefore the project has
no risk. The basic factory is in place and produces 40 locomotives a year.
The capacity of some sections is already greater than the present output. The
project is just a marginal investment with a very high payoff.   If electric
locomotives could be imported for US$1 million, a very unlikely circumstance,
the annual benefits would fall some 50%. The annual return would just equal
the investment costs and the ERR would fall to 59%.

/b   Bank-wide subsector for railways, in percent.   Forecast disbursements
are much shorter than the Bank profile, because (i) procurement is
limited to standard materials and equipment; (ii) mobilization for civil
works is completed and preparatory work has started; (iii) most tender
specifications have already been discussed with the Bank and finalized;
and (iv) tendering is expected to start in March/April 1984.

/_c: Based on depreciation provision show in"Criteria Used to Forecast Revenue and Costs" (Project File), page 5,
line 6 multiplied by 4%.
Note: 1. Depreciation would be set at 4% of the depreciable gross fixed assets in use. The somewhat high 4% rate takes
into account the following factors:
i. MR's fixed assets are recorded at historical cost thus,
ii. the timing of the planning process make it necessary to as calculate depreciation on the basis of the
gross fixed asssets as recorded two years earlier; and
iii.the network is heavily trafficked; for instance, the average 30-35 years for most railways.
