Project development objective Ref. PAD B.2, TechnicalAnnex 3

The development objective of the proposed TAL would be to support the implementation, monitoring,
and evaluation of the Government reform program supported by the Programmatic Loan for Sustainable
and Equitable Growth: Housing Sector Reform. The Housing Sector Reform Loan aims to improve the
policy environment for improving the living conditions of the poor and strengthening their access to
assets, notably housingand servicedherviceable land and would be embedded inthe cluster of support for
the Government's growth agenda, presentedto the Bank's Board of Executive Directors in anticipation of
the proposed TAL. The DPL supports the Government's program to (a) strengthen the sector institutions
managing Federal housing and urban development policy and programs; (b) build an efficient market for
formal housing finance capable of absorbing long-term savings and which will provide a stock of finished
housing for medium-term down-filtering of middle class housing; (c) establish a rational and
complementary system for housing subsidies for the poor; and (d) improve the conditions for land and
urban development by reducing barriers to formality and improving the affordability of formal land and
housingdevelopment.
Project description [one-sentence summary of each component] Ref. PAD B.3.a, TechnicalAnnex 4
The four components of the TAL are:

Component 1: Supporting the Institutional and Legal Frameworkfor Housing Policy (US$ 1.31 million).
The TAL would include resources to support the Ministry of Cities in its internal reorganization,
including the consolidation of the National Housing Secretariat as the key technical and policy entity for
coordinating policy design across the many public sector actors.

Component 2: Housing Finance Market Development (US$0.29 million). The Housing Finance Market
Development Component would support the improvement of the legal and regulatory framework for
housing loans, including incremental reforms to the existing housing finance system, the future
integration of SBPE in the full market system, and overall strengthening of the market-based Housing
Finance System (SFI).

Component 3: Housing Subsidies for the Poor (US$ 1.33 million). The focus of technical assistance
activities as relates to housing subsidy policy would be the rationalization of the Government's various
subsidy programs and the establishment of effective targeting, monitoring, and evaluation mechanisms.

Component 4: Land and Urban Development (US$ 1.06 million). The component would include the
provision of technical assistance for (a) the design and implementation of programs of the Ministry of
Cities to strengthen local governments in their efforts to achieve accreditation of their institutional
capacity to take the lead in local urban development policy setting and implementation (gestzoprdpria);
and (b) the development of a national urban upgrading program, including, inter alia, (i)research,
monitoring, and evaluation activities, at the Borrower`s federal level, of policy and regulatory efforts for
urban development and land subdivision; and (ii)   a series of activities to facilitate the implementation of
the policy innovations under the Program for progressive housing development, the preparation of local
master plans @lanosdiretores), and demand-side organization for housing subsidy programs.

1. Countryandsectorissues

Background and Key Sector Issues. Brazil is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America, with
approximately 80% of the population living in urban areas and 90% of the country's GDP being
generated in cities. Access to housing and reliable urban services i s essential to poverty reduction and
growth in Brazil, with housing being a potentially important component of the economy, contributing to
job creation (housing investment has a multiplier effect of 1.8), expansion of the finance system and
creation of household wealth. In the past, Brazil's performance in this area has been woefully inadequate;
outstanding mortgage loans are approximately 3-4% of GDP (compared with 15% in Chile and 65% in
the US), the housing "deficit" is estimated at 7.1 million units (equivalent to 28 million people without
access to adequate shelter); urban informal settlements are growing 4 times faster than average urban
growth; and an estimated 65% of new households formed annually cannot afford the most basic house
produced inthe formal market (700,000 householdsper year).

In February 2001, Brazil's Congress passed a constitutional amendment which guarantees the right to
adequate housing for all Brazilians. Accomplishing this ambitious goal while maintaining fiscal and
political discipline represents a major challenge; defining the role of the public sector in meeting the
housing needs of Brazil's poor population requires comprehensive and sustained policy reform and
investment, with a focused effort to mobilize financial sector resources and private sector savings. While
the issue of housing and the attendant social, economic, environmental, and health issues which stem
from the sustainable urban development agenda was a priority in the electoral campaign of the President,
elected in 2002, progress has been slow in the last two years, in large part as a result of the fiscal
restrictions self-imposed by the Government and the initiation of administrative and institutional reforms
to managethe sector.

Thekey issues facing the country include:


 0  The need to rationalize sector institutions and strengthen the capacity of public-sector institutions to
    design, monitor, and implement housing and urban development policy. The formal housing system
    in Brazil is a complex web of federal entities, private sector developers, and state and local
    governments. Over the last fifteen years, responsibility for housing and urban issues has been
    transferred to a number of ministries and secretariats, resulting in a general mismanagement of the
    sector and an obvious lack of policy direction. In the context of the Government's decision to
    transform the sector and make housing a national priority, efforts are needed to establish a coherent
    public sector structure able to formulate national housing and urban policy and to coordinate the
    various agents and authorities at the federal, state and local levels. While the creation of the Ministry
    of Cities in 2002 represents an important first step, efforts are needed to (a) articulate the strategic
    direction for the housing sector; (b) establish a national program for housing finance while avoiding
    the bottleneck risks of a single-window for transferring sector resources; (c) link federal housing
    policy and finances to other policy efforts at the local and state level; and (d) significantly strengthen
    the Ministry of Cities' capacity and policy relevance through a series of institutionalreforms.


 0  The need to create a h i d and efficient formal housing market. The absence of an efficient market
    for formal housing credit has a direct impact on the lower- and lower-middle income households
    directly and indirectly. On the one hand, housing finance markets are incomplete and do not serve
    large segments of the low-income population because the costs and risks to do so are too high. On the
    other hand, a well functioning mortgage market for higher-income households i s critical, in the
    medium-term, to poorer households as it creates a stock of financed housing which can "filter" down.

     While the overall market dynamic i s in large part driven by the macroeconomic conditions and public
     sector debt-related interest rate dynamic, the short-term policy agenda is rich. Simultaneous efforts
     are needed to (a) provide access to housing finance to households which could afford monthly
     mortgage payments but which lack a stock of savings for the current high levels of down payment of
     30 to 40 percent required; (b) incorporate micro-lenders into the housing finance market by increasing
     their access to the below-market rate funds to which large financial institutions currently have access;
     and (c) improve the legal and regulatory framework which governs the formal market, including the
     management and administration of the Workers Severance Fund (Fundo de Garantia do Tempo de
     Servigo, or FGTS)resources.

  0  The absence of a consistent and broad uroa-amof subsidies for the poor. Well-targeted subsidies for
     the poor are an important aspect of any housing market. Inthe absence of an efficient private market
     for very basic low income housing (because costs and risks are too high for formal market players to
     enter), and in order to compensate for the costs imposed by inappropriate regulation and market
     inefficiencies, subsidies in the short-term can help bridge the wide affordability gap which, in
     principle, could narrow in the medium-term as unaffordable planning regulations are removed, land
     management systems improved, and the structure of the housing finance system made more efficient.
     The key challenge for the Government will be to establish a housing subsidy policy which is both of
     highimpact and efficient, maximizingthe impact of limitedfiscal resources by leveraging credit from
     the financial system.


  0  The high costs - both financial and administrative - of land development, subdivision, and housing
      creation. The lack of formality in which new settlements for the urban poor emerge is a key driver of
     the creation of slums Cfuvelus) and the vicious cycle of marginalization of Brazil's urban poor.
      Inhabitants of informal / illegal settlements are often unable to access public services, have limited
      access to legal recourse, etc. It has taken decades for Brazil to recognize that a policy environment
      which creates incentives for formality i s a key pillar of both rational urban development and the
      overall poverty-reduction and growth agenda. The key challenges for Brazil are to address both the
      stock and flow of informality through (a) a concerted effort to formalize existing slums and improve
      their access to basic public services by developing a national slumupgrading strategy and a program
      of financing for urban upgrading; and (b) reducing the costs of new land development, subdivision,
      and registration.

The Government's medium-term strategy to improve access to affordable housing for the poor has 4 key
tenets:


  0   Rationalize sector institutions and the lePal and regulatory framework for housing and urban
      development. The Government aims to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Cities to formulate,
      articulate, and implement housing and urban development policy in Brazil. Some of the efforts
      underway include (a) the creation of a National Housing Plan (NHP) which would identify the
      targets, priorities, and key sector investment programs; (b) restructuring the Ministry of Cities to
      establish the needed institutional framework for cogent sector management, including the
      establishment of an interagency coordinating mechanism to manage sector dialogue across the public
      sector; (c) the establishment of a National Low Income Housing Fund (FNHIS) to finance the NHP;
      and (d) initiatives to extend technical assistance to state and municipal governments for the
      implementationof the many locally managed aspects of housing development policies.


  0   Support the development of a formal housing finance market. Since the mid-90s, Brazilian authorities
      have been struggling to restructure the country's housing finance sector and to enhance the role and
      impact of the market-based housing finance system (SFI) and to improve the existing savings-linked



                                                     2

    Sistema Brasileiro de PoupanGa e Emprestimo (SBPE) and the higher-end market based mortgage
    system, known as the SFI (Sistema Financeiro Zmobilia`rio). As regards SBPE, the key efforts in
    coming months and years will focus on the orderly and phasedexpansion and the integration of SBPE
    in the full market system and broaden its reach through changes to the targeting and weighting of
    loans eligible for financing. For the broader SFI, the Government aims to set the stage for a gradual
    expansion of market-based finance as market conditions evolve.


0   Address affordabilitv of housing through the creation of a comprehensive housing subsidy policy.
     The Government is implementing a multi-pronged approach as regards housing subsidies: (a) to
    dramatically increase the amount of finances in the system; (b) to move away from implicit interest
    rate subsidies to explicit upfront grants; and (c) to separate credit-linked subsidies from non-credit
    related grants. The Government has created the Programa Social de Habitquo (PSH), which
     combines an upfront down-payment subsidy to households with an upfront subsidy to lenders to
     compensate them for the extra risks and costs in lending to lower income households, and a well
     conceptualized auction system for participating financial agents. At the same time, the Federal
     Pension Severance Guarantee Fund (FGTS) has established a similar program for upfront housing
     subsidies for the poor.


0    Reduce the barriers to formality of housing and services for the poor. The Government i s supporting
     efforts to break the cycle of overregulation and informality which has dominated the growth of urban
     areas inBrazil for the last 30 years and which i s most evident in the expanses of urban and peri-urban
     slums that characterize Brazilian cities. The Government's strategy involves: (a) supporting a new
     law for land subdivision and development which aims to increase the supply of urban land by
     reducing the administrative requirements for new urban development (e.g. minimumlot sizes, overly
     onerous requirements for public spaces as a percentage of new development, unrealistic infrastructure
     dimensioning requirements, etc.); (b) enforcing the existing legal and administrative mechanisms
     required to regularize existing slums; and (c) extending technical assistance and capacity building to
     state and, particularly, municipal governments, the latter of which will play the key role as interface
     between the public sector and developers, financial institutions, and residents.

2. Rationalefor Bank involvement

CAS Linkage. The program i s fully consistent with the Brazil CAS, discussed by the Bank's Board of
Directors on December 9, 2003, as it supports the three main pillars of equity, sustainability and
competitiveness. Most fundamentally, the operation would support capacity buildingefforts linked to he
Government's initiatives to improve access to affordable housing and basic services and strengthen the
real assets of the poor. Housing often serves as a key source of capital accumulation and income
generation for lowlmoderate-income households, and improving urban development enhances the
efficiency and competitiveness of cities, which account disproportionately for national economic growth.
In addition, the comprehensive reforms being undertaken by the Government would increase the
sustainability and competitiveness of the housing finance sector. Further, the results-based-CAS sets the
framework for monitoring progress towards achieving the CAS goals. Within that framework, the CAS
states specifically that the TAL and proposed housing sector SWAP would contribute to a more
sustainable Brazil. The CAS identifies as medium-term outcomes: (a) that housing programs be better
targeted to the poorest; and (b) the reform of housing finance and land development regulation.

Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank is uniquely positioned to support the Government's program.
First, the Bank is a natural partner given its lead in engaging the Government in housing and urban
development policy dialogue over the last three years. Second, the proposed program i s fully consistent
with the CAS objective of building a more sustainable and equitable Brazil, as it will support the



                                                    3

Government's efforts to increasethe number of households with access to safe and secure formal housing
and services. Third,the proposed operation supports the Government's efforts maximize the efficiency of
housing market interventions through improvements to the structure and targeting of federal subsidy
programs and through the reduction of supply-side constraints for housing and land development. Fourth,
the Bank's proposed engagement leverages its ability to simultaneously bring financial support for
programmatic policy reform, technical assistance for policy design and capacity building, and investment-
linked support for housing subsidy programs.

3. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

The proposed TAL and accompanying Development Policy Loan (DPL) directly contribute to the
Government's poverty reduction and growth agendas. As regards the former, the package of policy
reforms and accompanying technical assistance intendto increase the access of Brazil's poor to affordable
shelter solutions through increased access and more efficient use of public sector subsidies, and through
the strengthening of the housingfinance system, a critical element in expanding the stock of housing. The
operations contribute to growth, both through the financial system reforms and through housing-related
investment and consumption.

4. Poverty Impact

Housing:Policv and Poverty. The Government has committed itself to the objective of reducingBrazil's
rate of extreme poverty by 50% by the year 2015. The strategy to achieve this objective includes
sustainedeconomic growth based on financial stability, investments in the poor through better education,
health and other social services as well as improved access to physical and financial capital, improved
access and enhanced social protection including social assistance and conditional cash transfers linked to
specific social targets. World Bank financed projects support several elements of this poverty reduction
strategy. World Bank analysis shows that the Government's poverty reduction strategy can be achieved
through a combination of 4.5% annual growth, continued increases in educational outcomes and human
capital, and further improvements in social policies.

The TAL supports the Government's housing reforms, which have been designed to benefit Brazil's poor
and are considered essential to improve the access of the poor to physical and financial assets and to
improve the human capital of the poorest segments of the society. Specifically, the proposed reforms
would have a bearing on poverty reduction by: (a) increasing the access of the poor to essential shelter
services; (b) enhancing their capacity to accumulate physical assets, access credit, improve self-image;
and (c) contribute directly to increased social capital inpoor communities. Indirectly, access to improved
shelter has been demonstrated to lead to higher returns for their children's education and expand
opportunities for higher paidjobs.'

The reforms supported by the housing reform-focused DPLs (which form a part of the cluster of
operations linked to the Government's growth agenda) which the proposed TAL supports, would help
increase the access to adequate housing through different ways, including better targeted subsidies to the
poor (formerly excluded from subsidized public lending for housing), improving the availability of
mortgage credit to low income families - with the benefit of teaching the financial market how to work
with this type of clients and therefore contribute towards a less perceived risk - expanding the policy
making capacity of the government structures in terms of land policy, regulations and other supply


' Access to adequate shelter or housing services can help predict subsequent improvement in both cash income of
the family as well as its well-being measuredby health indicators, education performance (including dropout rates)
and probability of exiting extreme poverty (Geoffrey Payne, 2004).

bottlenecks, while contributing to a more liquid and seamless housing finance market attracting a wider
base of resourcesfor the low income segment.

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

Integrated Bank Support to the Government's Program. Bank support to the Government's housing
reform and investment program would be structured over the next four years or so and would comprise
(a) Development Policy Loans aligned with the Government's budget cycle and linked to federal policy
reform efforts, including the establishment of a sector-wide housing subsidy program; (b) the proposed
Technical Assistance Loan (TAL) which would support efforts to strengthen the capacity of the
Government to formulate and implement housing and urban sector policy; and (c) a possible investment-
linked operation, to be prepared under the Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) modality, which the
Government has requested to finance the harmonized subsidy program expected to emerge before the
second phase of the housing sector program. The proposed loan supports the establishment of the
institutional and policy environment for sustainable housing sector development consistent with the
emerging national priorities and would identify the medium-term trajectory of housing and urban policy,
setting the stage for follow-on DPL, the focus of which will be to enhance the effectiveness of the
housingfinance system and the targeting and transparency of subsidy programs.

2. Projectdevelopmentobjectiveandkeyindicators

Project Development Objective. The development objective of the proposed TAL would be to support the
implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the Government reform program supported by the
Programmatic Loan for Sustainable and Equitable Growth: Housing Sector Reform. The DPL, presented
to the Board in late FY05, aims to improve the policy environment for improving the living conditions of
the poor and strengthening their access to assets, notably housing and servicedserviceable land and
would be embeddedinthe cluster of support for the Government's growth agenda. The DPL supports the
Government's program to (a) strengthen the sector institutions managing Federal housing and urban
development policy and programs; (b) build an efficient market for formal housing finance capable of
absorbing long-term savings and which will provide a stock of finished housing for medium-term down-
filtering of middle class housing; (c) establish a rational and complementary system for housing subsidies
for the poor; and (d) improve the conditions for land and urban development by reducing barriers to
formality and improving the affordability of formal land and housing development.

Key Indicators. The key indicators of TAL implementation are directly relatedto (a) the implementation
of capacity building; (b) the Government's overall policy trajectory; and (c) the use of information and
knowledge generated by the TAL in redesigning and refocusing the Government's policy initiatives.
Among the key indicators (see Annex 3 for the complete list of indicators) are:

June 30, 2006, the amount of the front-end fee, which i s financed under the Loan and was calculated as 0.25% of the
Loan amount, will revert back to an amount equal to 1% of the Loan amount. In this event, the Loan amount will
have to be increased to reflect a capitalized front-end fee of 1%. However, if the Bank's Executive Directors
approve a front-end fee waiver that applies after July 1,2006, the Loan amount will be reduced to reflect the amount
of any such waiver.

The four components of the TAL are:

Component 1: Supporting the Institutional and Legal Frameworkfor Housing Policy (US$ 1.31 million).
The TAL would include resources to support the Ministry of Cities in its internal reorganization,
including the consolidation of the National Housing Secretariat as the key technical and policy entity for
coordinating policy design across the many public sector actors. The component would finance technical
assistance related to the establishment of the FNHIS and, critically, to implement a broad program of
capacity building and training at the municipal and state level. Because municipalities will be taking on
greater responsibilities in the context of the evolving legal framework, efforts are urgently needed to
strengthen the ability of local governments to recover costs and manage the basic fiduciary and technical
aspects of urban development.

Component 2: Housing Finance Market Development ( ~ $ 0 . 2 9million}. The TAL would include
resources to support the improvement of the legal and regulatory framework for housing loans, including
incremental reforms to the existing housing finance system, the future integration of the SBPE in the full
market system, and overall strengthening of the market-based Housing Finance System (SFI). While the
reform agenda is broad and complex, and the sector actors have initiated a number of studies and
technical reviews, the Government has requested that the TAL activities be focused on (a) efforts to
disseminate information about the importance of a credible regulatory and legal framework for housing
finance among a broad audience which would include the judiciary and members of Congress; and (b) a
strategic study, by independent consultants, of the medium-term future of FGTS. The TAL activities
would complement other Government technical work on a number of issues, including: (a) the
development of new legal and financial instruments for promoting greater primary and secondary market
development; (b) the integration of SBPE in the full market system, and (c) efforts to support the drafting
of housing-specific consumer protection legislation, including a short study tour to the United States
and/or Western Europe where such efforts are also underway.

Component 3: Housing Subsidies for the Poor (US$ 1.33 million}. The focus of technical assistance
activities as relates to housing subsidy policy would be the rationalization of the Government's various
subsidy programs, and the establishment of effective targeting, monitoring, and evaluation mechanisms.
Activities to be supported include (a) technical assistance for subsidy harmonization and regularization
across the various subsidy programs (includingFederal budget or OGU resources, off-budget financing,
and FGTS programs); (b) the establishment of a tiered system of monitoring and evaluation, including
regular monitoring of subsidy programs as regards targeting, impact, unit costs, the performance and
compliance of financial intermediaries, and which would address both real-time needs and medium-term
living standards impact; (c) demand-side technical assistanceto local communities/local governments for
structuring and packaging requests to the PSH; (d) a series of outreach and dissemination activities as
regardsnational subsidy programs to improve understanding at the local level; and (e) technical assistance
to improve the targeting of subsidies, including studies and analysis for the establishment of a system for
poverty categorization that i s more reliable than the current system of self-declaration and i s consistent
with Bank and Government experience.

 Component 4: Land and Urban Development (US$ 1.06 million}.The component would include the
provision of technical assistance for the carrying out o f (a) the programs of the Ministry of Cities to
 strengthenlocal governments in their efforts to achieve accreditation of their institutional capacity to take
the lead in local urban development policy setting and implementation (gestzo prdpria); and (b) the
development of a national urban upgrading program, including, inter alia, (i)      research, monitoring, and
evaluation activities, at the Borrower's federal level, of policy and regulatory efforts for urban
development and land subdivision; and (ii)    a series of activities to facilitate the implementation of the

4. Lessons learned and reflected inthe project design

The experience of the World Bank and other donors in housing and urban development, and in TA
projects, generally, suggests a number of key lessons incorporatedin programdesign of the TAL:


    0   First and foremost, the synthetic nature of the housing and urban sectors requires addressing
        reforms in a range of areas to be effective, including credit and household savings, subsidies, and
        the broad urban development agenda. At the same time, selectivity i s important, and both the
        TAL and DPLs focus on what the Government and Bank team consider to be the most important
        issues in developing a robust housing system. For example, despite the complexities of urban land
        development issues in Brazil, the Government's approach to focus on reducing the cost of
        formality for the poor and improving land subdivision, regularization, and infrastructure
        development is a critical area of reform with the necessary political support to take immediate
        action.


    0   Second, the decision by the Government to pair housing-related DPLs with targeted technical
        assistance reflects both the commitment of the Government to support the strengthening of the
        housing sector institutions - and particularly the Ministry of Cities National Secretariat for
        Housing - and the interest in maintaining Bank involvement through hands-on technical
        assistance.


    0   Third,housingsubsidies function best inthe form of grants madeunder aunifiedsubsidy system
        that meets criteria for efficiency and equity, and the Government's reforms inthis area have made
        major strides in achieving this. When markets function, these grants best take the form of portable
        vouchers that households join with their own down payment and a market-rate loan to buy the
        home of their choice. When distortions disrupt markets - as i s too often the case for low-income
        households, in general, and which in Brazil also affects many moderate-income households -
        reforms that facilitate supply (e.g. organizing households into groups for projects, making
        available serviced lots, and strengthening property rights) arejust as important and a pre-requisite
        for the effective functioning of subsidy programs.


    0   Finally, in technical assistance operations, it is important to have flexibility in the allocation of
        funds. To this end, the TAL has been designed to offer the sector actors flexibility during
        implementation.

5 Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

Theteam and Government considered two alternative design options:

    0   A simificantly larger TAL which would include a broader program of capacity buildingactivities
        at all three levels of the Brazilian public administration. Given the needs for capacity

         strengthening and training at the municipal level, particularly, the team considered the inclusion
         of financing a large municipal strengthening program. This approach was rejected because of the
         Government's request to maintain the simplicity and focus of the operation. The Government
         requested that the TAL concentrate on creating the institutional capacity within the Federal
         Government, and in particular within SNH, to allow for the subsequentimplementationof needed
         municipal capacity building.

         A multi-institutional implementation arrangement. The Government and team initially discussed
         a project management arrangement that would have placed the TAL directly under the
         InterministerialHousing Policy Group (Grupo de Trabalho Interministerial de acompanhamento
         das Politicas de Financiamento e Subsidios h HabitapZo) (GTI-SFH). The Government
         determined that, given the significant objective of the TAL to strengthen the capacity of the SNH,
         and in order to put in place a streamlined and efficient project management structure, the
         operation should be managed within the SNH with a well-defined oversight role for the GTI-
         SFH.

Proiect Implementation. The Project has been designed to be implemented based on the existing sector
institutions and the evolving arrangements for policy management in the housing sector without creating
parallel implementation institutions. The National Housing Secretariat within the Ministry of Cities will
be the key implementation agent responsible for day-to-day TAL management in collaboration with the
Government's Interministerial Housing Working Group (Grupo de Trabalho Interministerial de
acompanhamento das Politicas de Financiamento e Subsidios h Habita@o) (GTI-SFH).The GTI-SFH,
created by Portaria Interministerial no. 404 of September 6, 2005 i s comprised of representatives of the
Ministry of Cities, Ministry of Finance, Central Bank and Casa Civil da Presiddncia da Repdblica. The
National Housing Secretariat would prepare six-month implementation plans in collaboration with the
GTI-SFH.Because of the importance of the finance sector institutions represented on the GTI-SFHin
providing technical oversight and guidance for issues related to Component 2 and Component 3 of the
Project, the GTI-SFHwould review technical outputs for consultancies financed under those components.
This is especially important given the links between the TAL and a number of technical reviews already
underway and planned in the housing sectors by the National Treasury, Ministry of Finance, and Central
Bank, inparticular.

Procurement Arrangements. Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance
with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004;
and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004,
and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. For each contract to be financed by the
Loadcredit, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for
prequalification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed between the
Borrower and the Bank project team in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at
least annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in
institutional capacity. Procurement activities will be carried out by the Ministe`rio das Cidades. An

assessment of the capacity of the Implementing Agency to implement procurement actions for the project
was carried out during preparation.       The assessment reviewed the organizational structure for
implementingthe Project and the interaction between the Project's staff responsible for procurement. The
overall project risk for procurement was determined to be average. Details of the procurement
arrangements and assessmentcan be found in Annex 9.

Financial Management and Audit Arrangements. Financial managementarrangements for federal projects
in the country rely on the Government's SistemaZntegradode.Administra@o Financeira (SIAFI) system.
The systemcan adequately manage and track the receipt anduse of funds ina highly transparent manner,
with a low risk for Bank and country funds. A financial management assessment of the Housing
Technical Assistance Loan was conducted during preparation. The assessment was carried out in
accordance with OP/BP 10.02 and the Guidelines for Assessment of Financial Management
Arrangements in World Bank Financed Projects issued by the Financial Management Sector Board on
October 15, 2003. The financial management risk associated with the project has been assessed as &.
Details of the financial management and audit arrangements as well as of the Financial Management
Assessment can be found in Annex 8.

3. Monitoringand evaluationof outcomes/results

The program includes a significant component for monitoring and evaluation of the implementation and
results of the Government's housing policies, and includes financing for baseline studies, the appropriate
information systems, and long-term impact evaluation. Monitoring, evaluation, and targeting activities are
focused on two levels - the implementation of the Government's federal housing policies and programs,
and, of equal importance, the implementation of housing policies at the local level, includingthe areas of
policy and implementation action which fall under the responsibilities of locally elected officials. Annex
7 includes a detailed description of the monitoring, evaluation, and targeting activities to be included
underthe TAL.

4. Critical risks and possible controversial aspects

The TAL itself is expected to have few significant risks. Nonetheless, the medium-term success of the
initiatives financed by the TAL would be contingent on the overall impact of the Government's housing
reform agenda.

2. Technical

The project supports efforts to improve the complex and inter-related system of housing finance and
urban development in Brazil. It aims to channel technical assistance to complement the four key areas of
Government policy which are being supported under the DPL that it accompanies. The technical
literature, international and Bank experience demonstrate that improving the availability of affordable
shelter for the poor and improving the strength and depth of the housing finance system for higher income
families are inextricably linked. The TAL and DPL aim to address issues of credit and household savings,
subsidies, land and urban development, and sectoral institutional strengthening in a comprehensive but
focused manner.

3. Fiduciary

Financial management and procurement capacity assessments were undertaken during project
preparation. The overall FinancialManagement Assessment conclusion is that the National Secretariat for
Housing has satisfactory financial management arrangements in place to meet the Bank's minimum
requirements. The financial management risk associated with the Project has been assessed as &. The
project's financial management system i s able to provide relevant and reliable financial information, in a
timely manner, and to support project's management in the control, planning, implementation and
monitoring of the project, towards the achievement of its objectives. The Procurement Capacity
Assessment reviewed the organizational structure for implementing the project and the interaction
between the project's staff responsible for procurement. An action plan was agreed upon and the overall
project risk for procurement was assessedas average.

4. Social

The actions included in the accompanying DPL in the area of housing policy, subsidies, and finance are
expected to have significant positive social impacts. A rapid environmental and social assessment of the
main issues addressedinthe programwas commissioned and i s summarized inAnnex 14.

5. Environment

The DPLand TAL support a policy reform agenda and provide accompanying technical assistancewhich
aim to improve the environmental health condition of Brazil's poor and middle-class. The program is
expected to have significantly positive environmental impacts. Annex 14 summarizes the key
environmental issues related to the program.

                        Annex 1: Country and Sector or ProgramBackground
                       BRAZIL: HousingSector Technical AssistanceProject

Background and Key Sector Issues. Brazil is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America, with
approximately 80% of the population living in urban areas and 90% of the country's GDP being
generated in cities. Access to housing and reliable urban services is essential to poverty reduction and
growth in Brazil. Housing is also an important component of the economy both on the consumption and
investment sides; it contributes to job creation and creation of household wealth. Brazil's housing sector
has, however, performed poorly in fulfilling its potential for either poverty alleviation or economic
growth: the housing "deficit" is estimated at 7.1 million units mostly for households with incomes of less
than 5 minimum wages (equivalent to 28 million people without access to adequate shelter); informal
urban settlements are growing 4 times faster than average urban growth; and an estimated 50% of new
households formed annually cannot afford the most basic house produced in the formal market even with
deep finance ~ubsidies.~    Moreover, the quantity of new houses constructed by the developer / construction
industry, includingby small builders,i s extremely inadequate. It is estimated that only 250,000 units were
constructed in 2003 by developers and small builders, compared to more than 1 million new households
formed in urban areas per year (Diamond and Rottmann, 2004). Such low formal sector housing
production makes it impossible to deal with the housingbacklog and the problemof informal settlements.

Housing ,is a large economic sector with significant forward and backward linkages, making it an
important instrument for anti-cyclical policies and sustained economic performance. Empirical data
indicate the importance of the sector in the economy across countries. Interms of consumption, housing-
related spending accounts for 20 to 50% of household expenditures (35% in Brazil). It forms 80-90% of
household wealth, and approximately 45% of national wealth. In Brazil housing accounts for 6% of GDP
(but this figure could be increased considerably) and 11% of annual capital formation (22% for the
construction sector as a whole). Inaddition, residentialconstruction, real estate services and the housing
finance industry are important employment sectors in most countries. Brazil's housing sector employs
about 5% of the labor force, while direct jobs for the construction sector represent 9.3% and 17.3% if
indirect jobs are considered. Multiplier effects are high both in terms of labor and expenditure (between
1.4 and 1.81)4.Housing has a large weight in the price index - 29% in Brazil'. Housing finance i s an
important component of the financial sector and often drives innovations in the financial sector at large.
In most developed countries, mortgage related assets represent more than half of total financial assets. In
the USA and Japan, mortgage loans represent more than 50% of GDP; while inBrazil this figure i s barely
5%.

Construction activitv in Brazil has followed the vagaries of the public investment program. The economic
stabilization effort has resulted in substantial decline in public works which in turn led to a decline in the
sector GDP (-13% in 2003). Increase in formal sector residential construction would provide a good
opportunity for a renewed boost in the sector. As an indication of the potential demand for housing, in
2004, 70% of all cement sales were for self-help construction. The construction industry i s well aware of
this potential demand inthe lower income segment and i s eager to collaborate with the public sector inthe
development of low-cost solutions. The institutional and regulatory inefficiencies in the land and finance
markets have prevented the industry from realizing this growth potential in this lower-middle income
market.

In February 2001, Brazil's Congress passed a constitutional amendment which guarantees the right to
adequate housing for all Brazilians, making shelter an essential social service similar to education and
health. Accomplishing this goal, while maintaining fiscal discipline, i s a major challenge. Defining the
role of the public sector in meeting the housing needs of Brazil's poor population includes comprehensive
and sustained policy and regulatory reforms and the creation of incentives to mobilize financial sector
resources and private sector savings. While the issue of housing and the attendant social, economic,
environmental, and health issues was a priority in the electoral campaign of President Luiz Ignacio "Lula"
da Silva elected in 2002, progress in housing outcomes has been slow in the last two years. This is in
large part due to the fact that the new Government had to develop an institutional and policy framework
for the sector from the ground up. Fiscal restrictions, self-imposed by the Government, further limited the
ability to launch new housinginvestment programs.

There are several reasons for the poor housing. sector performance. Brazil is a middle income country
with modest population and urban growth. It has subsidized its housing sector deeply and over a long
period of time. Yet, compared to countries with similar economic and demographic characteristics,
housing conditions are worse than would be expected. General lagging economic performance over the
last few decades and decreasing real incomes explain part of the housing sector's inadequate outcomes
especially for the very poor. Furthermore, monetary policy and lingering high government real interest
rates make housing finance a less attractive investment in general. The small size of the housing finance
system (both private and public) attests to that; Brazil has an outstanding residential mortgage debt of
about 3-4% of GDP and the real estate securities market has not developed beyond a pilot stage.

However, the inadequacv of the institutional frameworks and deficient finance and subsidy policy have
had a major impact on the poor sector performance. On the institutional front, the formal housing system
in Brazil has been a complex web of federal entities, state and local governments, private sector
developers and financial institutions. Over the last fifteen years, responsibility for housing and urban
issues has been sharedby a number of ministries and secretariats, resultingin a weakened managementof
the sector and a lack of policy direction.

Legal and institutional bottlenecks in the housing finance sector have prevented the creation of a liquid
and efficient formal housing. market and constrained demand for housing. Brazil's housing finance
markets are incomplete and do not serve large segments of the middle and low-income population
because the transaction costs and risks to do so are too high. Housing finance has been dominated by
government institutions dependent on directed credit and does not respond well to demand pressures. The
absence of a well functioning mortgage market limits the production of middle income housing and the
related downward filtering            of existing housing to lower-income households. The existing sector
institutions and financing mechanism will need to change to a more encompassing, sustainable and
competitive systems.

Until recently, the bulk of housing subsidies in Brazil were provided through the government housing
finance systemto a broad spectrum of middle income households. Households earning incomes below the
median, for whom neither the housing market nor the government mortgage system delivered, were
largely excluded from federal subsidies, with the exception of limited upgrading subsidies. While 95
percent of the housing deficit i s concentrated on poor people (earning less than 5 minimumwages) there
were neither measures to reduce the afSordability gap nor to establish a consistent and broad program of
subsidiesfor thepoor.6


  Well-targetedsubsidies are an important aspect of most housing markets in emerging economies as a large part of the low
income strata cannot affordthe cheapest house producedinthe formal market and the private market is reluctantto enter the low
income housingmarket because of smaller profit margins and high risks. Subsidies can in the short-term help bridge the wide
affordability gap. In principle, this gap should narrow in the medium-termas cumbersome and thus costly urban planning and


                                                              14

The dominance of the existing directedcredit and public housing finance systems i s clear. Out of about
360,000 housing loans made in 2004, 75% were financed through the systems of FGTS, FAT and SBPE,
using tax-based funding or tax-subsidies and using CEF as its main lender. State governments do often
have their own funds to make housing loans for underserved groups, bringing the proportion of loans
made through public sector institutions closer to 80 percent. While these systems have allowed housing
lending to continue duringperiods of macro-economic volatility and high interest rates for housing loans,
they are costly, are uneven in the depth of subsidies they provide and in their current coverage of
segments of the "market". They can not easily respond to increaseddemand for finance.

The lack of expansion of private housing finance as well as the lack of use of subsidized funds by private
banks has several causes. These include Brazil's history of macro-economic instability, the judicial
protection of borrowers, and the dominance of special government funding and lendingsystems. The most
important reason, however, appears to be the high SELIC rate (set at 18.75% in February), the real
domestic interest rate, which offers investors risk-free and liquid assets at attractive returns. This rate
results from the monetary policy adopted by the Government to stabilize the economy. While a stable
macro economy i s critical for the performance of the housing finance sector, the current high Selic rate
puts a floor in the housing finance market.           As long as the SELIC rate remains high relative to
investments in more risky and administratively more costly housingfinance loans, the development of the
private mortgage market will remain limited. In addition, the high real interest rates make borrowing
unaffordable for most households. Also, with current high real government rates and high lending risks
in the housing finance sector, subsidized funding for housing finance is not attractive for lenders when
compared to other risk-adjusted market investments.I

Further. restrictive land subdivisions, inefficient registry and complex perrilitting system all constrain the
elasticity of urban land supplv limiting the access of the poor to urbanized land, and increasing the costs
of housing solutions.

The Long-term vision: The vision for the sector i s a combination of a well-functioning. housing. market
and targeted policy interventions to attend to market failures and address the affordability gap. Inthis
scenario:
   (a) new households will be able to access formal shelter - either renting or purchasing it - according
        to their preferences and income level; low-income households who qualify for a loan with some
        help would be served with credit-linked subsidies to help them with down payment in complement
        to their own savings; for those who do not quality for finance, non-credit linked subsidies would
        be provided by municipalities inthe form of serviced land or partially built housingunits';
   (b) as interest rates come down, microeconomic policies improve credit risk and risk insurance and
        secondary real estate finance provide attractive long-term assets for investors the housing finance
        would likely grow rapidly (as it has in other countries) possibly reaching 10% of GDP in 5-7 years
        and 15% in another 5 years and will serve an increasing proportion of the upper- and middle-
        income market; as interest rates come down, the existing directed credit system (SBPE) would be
        deregulated over time and the capital market would expand to serve the middle and upper levels of
        demand:



development regulations are removed,land management systems are made more effective, andthe structure and efficiency of the
housing finance systemimproved.
  These subsidized funds are moreover often limited (FGTS) or costly to accumulate (savings accounts of the tax
exempted SBPE system).
* These families would be able to contribute through self-help efforts or by taking out micro-finance loans to
complete their "authorized" house.


                                                        15

   (c) FGTS would continue in the intermediate term to provide finance-linked subsidies (depending on
       the decision of its membersand contributors). It will be able to leverage the participationof private
       lenders and other housing finance institutions into moderate income sector; in the medium term,
       when the Government can expand its subsidies through the PSH, FGTS will increasethe return on
       its assets to provide members with a positive real return and decrease its role as the housing
       provider of last resort;
   (d) resources available for the federal housing policy would be usedto leverage resources available at
       the state and local levels, probably in a 1:8 ratio, stimulating regulatory change to improve land
       supply for low-income housing and preventing further expansion of informal settlements and
       providing titles to slum dwellers with a minimumof administrative problems;
   (e) municipalities would gradually understand the negative impact of informality and would adopt
       well-designed plans, drawn jointly with local populations and aimed at pre-empting illegal
       occupations or squatting on non-serviced landplots. In such a scenario, risks are better measured
       and priced, and pension funds, insurance companies, and other long-term savers believe that the
       housing market i s sufficiently secure and attractive to deserve part of their funds. While the
       market could increasingly take care of the newcomers, the public sector would have better chances
       to address the housing deficit in a sustained way. This will take more than one decade.

The Government has taken stem towards the implementation of the above vision and is committed to
significant uolicy changes. With the gradual stabilization of the macro economy and increasein economic
growth (GDP growth of approximately 5% i s expected in 2005), the Government is focusing attention on
the core areas of institutional and regulatory reforms in the land and finance sector that hinder the
expansion of housing production and the investment in existing substandard housing. The core areas of
reform include:

        Institutional Framework. In the context of the Government's decision to make housing a
        national priority, efforts are being made to establish a coherent public sector structure able to
        formulate national housing and urban policy and to coordinate the various agents and authorities
        at the federal, state and local levels. The creation of the Ministry of Cities (MOC) in 2002 with
        full responsibility for sector policy represented an important first step. Further efforts are needed
        to:
             o articulate the strategic direction for the housingsector;
             o establish a coherent federal program to improve access to housing finance and rationalize
                 housing subsidies;
             o linkfederal housingpolicy and finances to other policy efforts at the local and state level;
                 and
             o significantly strengthen the Ministry of Cities' capacity and policy relevance through a
                 series of institutionalreforms.

        Finance. While the financial system and markets are in large part driven by macroeconomic
         conditions and public sector debt-related interest rate dynamics, it i s critical to pursue a short- and
         medium-term policy agenda to ensure that mortgage contracts are fulfilled, credit information i s
         generally accessible, and new credit instruments are created for the financing of housing. The
         Government's policy agenda focuses on the strengthening of a capital-markets based housing
         finance system, and a gradual transitioning away from the current directed credit systems and
         segmented markets. Simultaneous efforts are needed to encourage more banks and non-bank
         financial institutions to participate inthe housing finance market by:

             o    improving the legal and regulatory framework which governs the formal housingfinance
                 market (both government and market-based segments);
             o establishing a liquidsecondary market for tradable real-estate instruments;


                                                      16

            o increasing access by lenders to existing special funds for housing finance and subsidy
                programs and allowing lenders to price their products according to competitive profit
                incentives; and
            o ensuring that related markets, such as construction and land markets, operate
                competitively and are not constrained by cumbersome procedures or inappropriate
                regulations.

        Housing subsidy policy to assist the poor while improvingformal housing market output within
        the context of limitedfiscal resources is the driving force behindthe new government policy. A
        major challenge is to improve targeting and transparency of existing housing subsidies, adjusting
        subsidy instruments to medium and long-term macro-economic expectations, and to leverage
        investments by the financial system, sub-national governments and individual households.

        Land Supply Rigidities. The obstacles to formal land development accessible to the urban poor
        are a key driver of the creation of slums (favelas) and the vicious cycle of marginalization of
        Brazil's urban poor. Inhabitants of informal / illegal settlements are often unable to access public
        services and have limited access to legal recourse. It has taken decades for Brazil to recognize
        that a policy environment which creates incentives for private sector housing development i s a
        key pillar of both urban development and the overall poverty-reduction and growth agenda. The
        key challenges for Brazil are to address both the stock                   flow of informal developments
        through:

             o a concerted effort to formalize existing slums and improve their access to basic public
                 services by developing a national slum upgrading strategy and a program of financing for
                 urban upgrading; and
             o reducing the regulatory complexity and excess, costs and time it takes to subdivide and
                 develop new land, and register titles.

Housing Policy and Poverty. The Government has committed itself to the objective of reducingBrazil's
rate of extreme poverty by 50% by the year 2015. The strategy to achieve this objective includes
sustainedeconomic growth based on financial stability, investments in the poor through better education,
health and other social services as well as improved access to physical and financial capital, improved
access and enhanced social protection including social assistance and conditional cash transfers linked to
specific social targets. World Bank financed projects support several elements of this poverty reduction
strategy. World Bank analysis shows that the government poverty reduction strategy can be achieved
through a combination of 4.5% annual growth, continued increases in educational outcomes and human
capital and further improvements in social policies. The proposed reforms would have a bearing on
poverty reduction by: (a) increasing access of the poor to essential shelter services; (b) enhancing the
capacity to accumulate and improve housing assets, by expanding access to housing credit and upfront
subsidies for housing, Indirectly, access to improved shelter in poor communities has been demonstrated
to lead to improved self-image, higher returns for children's education and increasing opportunities for
better paidjobs.'


 Access to adequate shelter or housing services can help predict subsequent improvement in both cash income of
the family as well as its well-being measured by health indicators, education performance (including dropout rates)
and probability of exiting extreme poverty (Geoffrey Payne, 2004). In addition to providing shelter, housing also
plays a more standard role as an asset, as acquisition for the urban poor offers the opportunity for small incremental
investments (World Bank, November 2004, Report No 30465, The Urban Poor in Latin America). The returns to
housing as an asset include the flow of housing services it provides some of which can be monetized in case of need
by taking in new tenants or extended household members who share in the upkeep o f the household. In addition,
homeownership provides a constant flow of services and frees the family from the constraint of having to generate a

The reforms supported by the housing sector-related DPLs would help increase the access to adequate
housing in a number of ways, including(a) better targeted subsidies to the poor (formerly excluded from
all the housing subsidize public lending); (b) improving the availability of mortgage credit to low income
families - with the benefit of teaching the financial market how to work with this type of client and
therefore contribute towards a less perceived risk; (c) expanding the policy making capacity of the
government structures in terms of land policy; (d) regulations and other supply bottlenecks; and (e)
contributingto a more liquid and seamless housing finance market attracting a wider base of resources for
the low income segment.

House affordability is a major issue in Brazil, directly associated with poverty and low income levels.
Brazilian poor, like all poor always find a way to protect themselves against the weather inclemency and
to create a minimum of privacy. In fact, the annual production of housing units i s estimated at 1.1
million, roughly keeping up with household formation."             However, only 16% of these houses were
authorized buildings. The others were built without being in compliance with the planning and building
regulations, i.e., favelas, invasdes, and improvised housing. Estimates of the current stock of unauthorized
housing range from 32 % in Recife to 14 % in Rio de Janeiro; and 9.4 % in Sao Paulo, in a recent
IPENDIRUR study". These units are deprived of minimum infrastructure, easy prey of violence and
crime and often instruments of discrimination in the labor market. The main reason for such wide gap i s
low affordability. Household incomes are low relative to housing costs in the formal market. The lowest
market produced house (approximately 35 to 40m2) in suburbs of metropolitan areas, sells for R$29,000
to R$31,000. Other new construction figures show prices as low as R$22,400 for flats of 20m2.I2 The
median urban household income is estimated at R$770 (December 2001)13. With current high mortgage
interest rates of approximately 20 %, 60 to 70 % of urban households cannot afford to buy the lowest
priced market-produced, unsubsidized house. These values are confirmed by analytical work carried out
by the Bank.14 A conjugated approach would require both a boost in the purchasing power of the lowest
deciles and measures to reduce the cost of housing units. These include improvement in the housing
finance andthe cost of formality - connected with land policies and zoning and regulations.

The Growth / Housing Relationship. The disappointing track record of the reforms of the 1990s has its
roots in both slow capital accumulation and limited productivity growth. Not even in the 1980s was the
contribution of capital accumulation to growth as low as it was in the 1990s. Gross annual capital
formation decreased from 23.5 percent of GDP in the mid-seventies to less than 15 percent in the early
nineties, bouncing back slightly to 17 percent in 2000. Emerging economies such as Chile and China as



fixed sum for rent every month. Given the large share of the poor employed in the informal markets, the poor will
prefer to own their own shelter and avoid commitment to a fixed and regular payment as a housing rent. This can be
important especially at time of crisis: in Uruguay, 10% of renters declared they had to move following the crisis in
order to cut down on cash payments. Evidence from surveys on risk management in Chile and Peru finds that
investment in housing acts as a substitute for formal retirement svstems. Home ownership in L A C tends to be
higher than in other parts of the world and some authors tend to believe that this i s a way to cope with uncertainty
and the negative consequences of financial crisis and macroeconomic disasters.
Io Instituto Ciduduniu, 2000. This observation i s consistent with backlog figures for 2000 showing relatively less
overcrowding.
   The mayor of Salvador estimates that 50% of households live infuvelus or invusdes. Differences need to be
clarified.

inconsistent.

well as OECD countries have sustained investment ratios much larger than Brazil during the last fifteen
years.

Since 2003, the Government has established an agenda of microeconomic and institutional reforms to
foster capital accumulation and productivity gains and thereby favor sustainable and equitable growth.
Decline in investment levels in infrastructure have been large. Productivity performance has been
relatively better but a poor "investment climate" is still a major obstacle to further productivity gains. The
reforms were structured around four pillars: (a) reducing logistics costs to raise productivity and ease
trade; (b) improving the business environment to enable better market functioning; (c) enhancing
financial efficiency and depth; and (d) transforming knowledge into productivity through innovation.
These were considered a sufficient and politically feasible set of reforms and still part of broader
development strategy to promote sustainable and equitable growth.

The new housing strategy i s a deepening of the government's microeconomic agenda of reforms.
Increased mortgage credit, effective property rights, and removing obstacles to commercial lending for
housing are among the pillars of a sound housing strategy. These match the broader initiatives of
supporting private sector development, improving the business environment, and increasing financial
depth, which are ingredients of the government's growth agenda. Better and streamlined regulation for
land use are also an ingredient of the larger task of improving infrastructure regulation and simplifying
business entry and operation, other elements of this agenda. And the emphasis on targeted subsidies and
auctioning i s part of a broader effort to increase the efficiency of social expenditure. The new housing
policy will thus galvanize the government's microeconomic agenda, reduce social distress and improve
fiscal management

Housing Finance and the Finance Market Linkages. The link between housing and finance is evident.
Housing i s a long duration good (the average age in the USA i s 70 years) which i s amenable to be            ,

financed by long-term debt. Indeveloped countries, housing financial instruments are used to deepen the
capital markets as they provide long maturity papers backed by secured collaterals.            In developing
countries, and in Latin America in particular, the development of mortgage markets did not happen until
the 1990s, a consequence of widespread financial instability, macroeconomic fluctuations, the lack of
regulatory framework and very high interest risk. Inthe past, housing finance was provided in a directed
and segmented way through the public sector, by special banks and funded by special resources (most
often compulsory wage deduction, liquid tax free deposits) and oriented to specific consumers classes
under fixed interest rate caps. The closed system was obviously inefficient as it stifled competition and
did not allow for any expansion of the market or the attraction of universal banks. Macroeconomic
instability and high price levels contributedto this situation. The idea of an open system, where universal
banks and capital markets are encouraged to take part of the housing sector development (especially the
low income where the needs are the highest) does not appear until the mid 1990s with some important
legislation passed in several countries in Latin America.

In Brazil, the development of mortgage credit (moving away from special circuits), ensuring effective
property rights, removing obstacles to commercial lending for housing, and mark up to capital markets i s
one of the fundamental pillars of World Bank housing policy ad~ice'~.Brazil has made impressive
progress in terms of integration in the world economy, exchange and interest rates policies and
macroeconomic stability. On financial infrastructure, the basic pillars are in place. The legal system i s
accountable, accounting systems are in place, financial institutions are subject to regulation and the
payment systems are inplace. The same i s the case with most urban laws and policies. Generally there is
clarity of ownership and property rights, urban planning i s moderately sensitive to economic factors, land
development is somewhat unpredictable, local and national taxation are stable and predictable. However,

interest rates for housing are still regulated in line with the still existing direct and subsidized interest rate
system; government continues to intervene in the financial system - notably in the housing direct credit
and through implicitly subsidized interest rates while the government public debt continues crowing out
of long-termcapital markets (total). The strategy toward specialized financial institutions and services for
housing, industry, SMEs and agriculture is gradually changing with the Government being increasingly
open to have universal banks do housing mortgages to attract the largest volume of resources to the
sector. While there is coordination of financial policy, regulation and supervision, the policy towards
competition among financial institutions is slowing takinghold, promoting a gradual access to subsidized
sources of funds and in theory defending the transition from market segmentation into seamless financial
markets, supported by a legal framework that is coherent, simple, non-discriminatory, and pragmatic. The
proposed program would steadily contribute for the deepening of the system and its expansion. At the
moment, the non-regulated financial system represents about 4% of total housing finance. Private direct
credit (funded by saving book accounts, SBPE) represents 25%; FGTS/CEF accounts for 54% of housing
finance; the central government finances another 4%.

Core Reform Areas. The key issues which the Government has engaged in reforming the housing sector
include:


    0    The need to rationalize sector institutions and strengthen their capacitv to design, monitor, and
         implement housing and urban development policv. The formal housing system in Brazil i s a
         complex web of federal entities, state and local governments, private sector developers and
         financial institutions. Over the last fifteen years, responsibility for housing and urban issues has
         been shared by a number of ministries and secretariats, resulting in a weakened management of
         the sector and a lack of policy direction.        In the context of the Government's decision to
         transform the sector and make housing a national priority, efforts are needed to establish a
         coherent public sector structure able to formulate national housing and urban policy and to
         coordinate the various agents and authorities at the federal, state and local levels. While the
         creation of the Ministry of Cities (MOC) in 2002 with full responsibility for sector policy
         represents an important first step, efforts are needed to (a) articulate the strategic direction for the
         housing sector; (b) establish a national program for housing finance and housing subsidies while
         expanding distribution channels and the number of participating lenders ;(c) link federal housing
         policy and finances to other policy efforts at the local and state level; and (d) significantly
         strengthen the Ministry of Cities' capacity and policy relevance through a series of institutional
         reforms.


     0   The need to create a liquid and efficient formal housing market. The absence of an efficient
         market for formal housing credit has a negative impact on the middle and lower income
         households, both directly and indirectly.         On the one hand, housing finance markets are
         incomplete and do not serve large segments of the middle and low income population because the
         costs and risks to do so are too high. On the other hand, the absence of a well functioning
         mortgage market for middle and higher-income households limits the production of middle
         income housing and the related downward filtering of existing housing to lower-income
         households. While the overall market situation i s in large part driven by macroeconomic
         conditions and public sector debt-related interest rate dynamics, the short-and medium term
         policy agenda to improve access to finance and formal housing i s critical to pursue. The
         Government's explicit policy agenda revolves around the establishment and strengthening of a
         capital-markets based system, a clear departure from a history of directed credit and a segmented
         market. Simultaneous efforts are needed to (a) provide access to housing finance to households
         which could afford monthly mortgage payments but who lack a stock of savings for the current
         high levels of down payment required; (b) encourage more banks and alternative lenders to
         participate in the housing finance market by increasing their access to existing funding and


                                                       20

  subsidy programs and allowing them to price their products according to competitive profit
  incentives; (c) improve the legal and regulatory framework which governs the formal mortgage
  market and the establishment of a liquid secondary market for tradable mortgage-based
  instruments; and (d) ensure that related markets, such as construction and land markets, operate
  competitively and are not constrained by cumbersome procedures or inappropriate regulations.


0 The absence of a consistent and broad urea-am of subsidies for the Door. Well-targeted subsidies
  for the poor are an important aspect of most housing markets in emerging economies as a large
  part of the low income strata cannot afford the cheapest house produced in the formal market and
  the private market i s reluctant to enter the low income housing market because of smaller profit
  margins and highrisks. Subsidies can in the short-term help bridge the wide affordability gap. In
  principle, this gap could narrow in the medium-term as cumbersome and thus costly urban
  planning and development regulations are removed, land management systems are made more
  effective, and the structure and efficiency of the housing finance system improved, changes
  which would drive down prices and improve the affordability of housing solutions. The key
  challenge for the Government will be to establish a housing subsidy policy which is effective in
  reaching its objectives, efficient, well-targeted and transparent, and uses its limited fiscal
  resourcesto leverage investments by the financial system and individual households.


0 The high costs - both financial and administrative - of land development, subdivision, and
  housingcreation. The obstacles to formal land development accessible to the urbanpoor are a key
  driver of the creation of slums (favelas) and the vicious cycle of marginalization of Brazil's urban
  poor. Inhabitants of informal / illegal settlements are often unable to access public services, have
  limited access to legal recourse, etc. It has taken decades for Brazil to recognize that a policy
  environment which creates incentives for formal private sector housing development i s a key
  pillar of both rational urban development and the overall poverty-reduction and growth agenda.
  The key challenges for Brazil are to address both the stock        flow of informal developments
  through (a) a concerted effort to formalize existing fuvelas and improve their access to basic
  public services by developing a national slum upgrading strategy and a program of financing for
  urban upgrading; and (b) reducingthe regulatory complexity and excess, costs andtime it takes to
  subdivide and develop new land, and register titles.

                             Annex 4: Detailed Project Description
                   BRAZIL: HousingSector Technical Assistance Project

1.Project Components andFinancingArrangements

The operation has been designed with four components linkedto the four programmatic areas of
policy reform being undertaken by the Government. Consistent with the country financing
parameters, the operation would finance 100% of eligible expenditures for the four components
of technical assistance. The Ministry of Cities' National Housing Secretariat would act as the key
implementing agency, responsible for day-to-day management (including procurement) of the
TAL. The Interministerial Housing Policy Group (GTI-SFH), which includes representatives of
the Central Bank, Ministry of Finance, Casa Civil da Presid2ncia da Repu'blica, and Ministry of
Cities, would play an important role as the project steering committee, reviewing a six-month
Project implementation plan and signing off on all terms of reference and technical deliverables
for Components 2 and 3.

2. Detailed Descriptionof Project components

The Project i s structured with four components:

Component I: Supporting the Institutional and Legal Framework for Housing Policy (US$ 1.31
million). The TAL would include resources to support the Ministry of Cities in its internal
reorganization, including the consolidation of the National Housing Secretariat as the key
technical and policy entity for managing coordinate policy design across the many public sector
actors. The component would finance technical assistance related to the establishment of the
FNHIS and, critically, to implement a broad program of capacity building and training at the
municipal and state level. Because municipalities will be taking on greater responsibilities in the
context of the evolving legal framework, efforts are urgently needed to strengthen the ability of
local governments to recover costs and manage the basic fiduciary and technical aspects of urban
development. The specific activities includedunder Component 1include:


    0    Dissemination of the National Housing Policy. The operation would finance technical
         assistanceto support the public dissemination of the National Housing Policy (NHP) and
         its instruments, and the strengthening of the managerial, technical and operational
         capacities within SNH. Specifically, the component would finance (a) activities to
         broadly disseminate the NHP and discuss its content with stakeholders; and (b) technical
         assistance for converting the NHPinto a draft law, expected to be submittedto Congress
         in2005.


     0   Strengthening of the National Housing Secretariat and Technical assistance to support the
         preparation and dissemination of the National Housing Plan. The National Housing Plan
         i s the technical counterweight to the National Housing Plan which outlines the specific
         activities, targets, actions, activities, and policy tools which would be used to implement
         the National Housing Plan. The operation would finance (a) local and international
         technical assistance to support the drafting of the National Housing Plan; (b) consultant
         services to support the strengthening of in-house capacity for policy formulation as
         regards the housing sector, including experienced national and international technical
         specialists; (c) training activities, including in-country training and international training
         for SNH staff; (d) a small amount of office equipment, namely computers and software,




                                                   27

        to facilitate the work of SNH staff and consultants; and (e) incremental operating
        expenses, includingoffice expenses and domestic travel


    0   Technical assistance to support the operationalization of the National Housing Fund. The
        National Housing Fund, which was established by law in 2004, represents the juridical
        instrument for the implementation of a rationalized system of federal housing subsidies
        across income groups and geographical areas. In the short-term, as the Government
        prepares to channel federal budget (OGU) resources through the Fund, efforts are needed
        by the Ministry of Cities to establish the operational procedures for the functioning of the
        Fund, including managerial responsibility and oversight, access criteria, the nature and
        composition of OGU budget items and programs included under the Fund, reporting
        requirements and procedures, and the roles and responsibilities of decentralized and local
        actors, including financial agents and promoters, in the use of Fund resources. The
        Project would finance a contract with a consulting firm to support the Ministry in
        preparinga comprehensive operational manual for the Fund.

Component 2: Housing Finance Market Development (US$ 0.29 million). The TAL would
include resources to support the improvement of the legal and regulatory framework for housing
loans, including incremental reforms to the existing housing finance system, the future integration
of the SBPE in the full market system, and overall strengthening of the market-based SFI. While
the reform agenda i s broad and complex, and the sector actors have initiated a number of studies
and technical reviews, the Government has requestedthat the TAL activities be highly focused on
(a) efforts to disseminate information about the importance of a credible regulatory and legal
framework for housing finance among a broad audience which would include the judiciary and
members of Congress; and (b) a strategic study, by independent consultants, of the medium-term
future of FGTS. The TAL, activities would complement other Government technical work on a
number of issues, including: (a) the development of new legal and financial instruments for
promoting greater primary and secondary market development; (b) the transition and future
integration of SBPE in the full market system, and (c) efforts to support the drafting of housing-
specific consumer protection legislation, including a short study tour to the UnitedStates and/or
Western Europe where such efforts are also underway. The core activities to be financed under
the Component include:


    0   Outreach and information dissemination for Judiciary, NGO and Congressional
        committee members. The persistent unpredictability of the legal and regulatory system as
        regards the rights of lenders and borrowers remains an important impediment to the
        credibility of the housing finance system. The Project would finance a series of
        workshops to disseminate information among academics, NGO representatives, members
        of thejudiciary, and Congressional committee members and their technical staffs.


    0   A study and assessment of alternative lenders. The purpose of the study is to assess the
        potential of alternative lenders, such as microfinance institutions to provide financial
        products to low-income families, such as housing improvement loans, that would be an
        alternative to traditional mortgage financing, potentially filling an important affordability
        gap that exists inthe current housing finance system.


    0   A strategic study for FGTS. The Project would include financing to prepare an
         independent assessment and strategic vision of the structure, efficiency, and coherence of
        FGTS' role and activities. The strategic assessment of FGTS would include, inter alia:
         (a) a review of options for improving access to a broad spectrum of domestic lenders,



                                                28

        including options for adjusted interest rate pricing according to income and credit risk;
        and (b) options for supporting the transition of the FGTS imbedded-interest rate subsidy
        into a less-distorting, more explicit and transparent upfront subsidy. The strategic study
        would likely be undertaken by a multi-sectoral consulting firm with experience in
        finance, law, and public sector management.

Component 3: Housing Subsidies for the Poor (US$ 1.33 million). The focus of technical
assistance activities as relates to housing subsidy policy would be the rationalization of the
Government's various subsidy programs and the establishment of effective targeting, monitoring,
and evaluation mechanisms.Activities to be supported include (a) technical assistancefor subsidy
harmonization and regularization across the various subsidy programs (including OGU, off-
budget, and FGTS programs); (b) the establishment of a tiered system of monitoring and
evaluation, including regular monitoring of subsidy programs as regards targeting, impact, unit
costs, the performance and compliance of financial intermediaries, and which would address both
real-time needs and medium-termliving standards impact; (c) demand-side technical assistanceto
local communities/local governments for structuring and packaging requests to the PSH; (d) a
series of outreach and dissemination activities as regard national subsidy programs to improve
understanding at the local level; and (e) technical assistance to improve the targeting of subsidies,
including studies and analysis for the establishment of a system for poverty categorization that i s
more reliable than the current system of self-declaration and is consistent with Bank and
Government experience. The activities under Component 3 include:


    0    Support for Subsidy Harmonization and Rationalization. The most critical action in the
         immediate term for the Government is to rationalize the Government's myriad subsidy
         programs across income groups, establishing consistent criteria for subsidy access and
         consistent subsidy terms (financial and administrative) that create a harmonized spectrum
         of both credit-linkedand non-credit linked subsidies. The TAL would include financing
         for consultants to support the Ministry of Cities and the GTI-SFHto review the existing
         subsidy programs, including PSH, PAR, and the FGTS subsidies (both upfront and
         interest rate) and fine-tune them consistent with the overall monitoring and evaluation
         approach.


    0    The establishment of a comprehensive monitoring: and evaluation system. The program
         would finance a tiered system for targeting, monitoring and evaluation of the
         Government's housing programs and which would aim to provide policy makers with
         information about municipal land and housing markets. Annex 7 includes a detailed
         description of the M&E approach.


    0    Dissemination activities of national subsidy programs to improve understanding: of
         federal subsidy schemes at the local level. There i s significant demand from local
         governments to understand the Government subsidy programs, specifically the new PSH.
         The Project would finance (a) a program of regional workshops to broadly disseminate
         PSH and other program information to both state and local officials; and (b) the
         improvement of existing training materials which would be distributed to local
         governments and financial institutions.

Component 4: Land and Urban Development (US$ 1.06 million). Provision of technical
assistance for the carrying out o f (a) the programs of the Ministry of Cities to strengthen local
governments in their efforts to achieve accreditation of their institutional capacity to take the lead
in local urban development policy setting and implementation (gestlio prdpria); and (b) the



                                                29

development of a national urban upgrading program, including, inter alia, (i)research,
monitoring, and evaluation activities, at the Borrower's federal level, of policy and regulatory
efforts for urban development and land subdivision; and (ii)     a series of activities to facilitate the
implementation of the policy innovations under the Program for progressive housing
development, the preparation of local master plans (planos diretores), and demand-side
organization for housing subsidy programs. Inparticular, the TAL would support:


    0    Workshops, studies, case studies, and data collection related to urban land markets.
         Activities would include technical activities related to the analysis of the regulatory and
         institutional supply constraints as inputs for the preparation of the pillar of the National
         Housing plan related to increasing urban land supply and reducing supply-side
         constraints on formal housing development. Specific studies would include analysis and
         data collection in regards to licensing, processing, registration, infrastructure
         requirements, and the establishment of minimumlot sizes and other standards at the local
         level. Such activities would culminate in the creation of a simple municipal land and
         housingbenchmarlung system, includedas part of the overall M&Eprogram.


    0    Activities for the development of local governments' capacity for improving permitting
         and registration processes. Based on the results of the land market analytical work, the
         Ministry would prepare and widely disseminate information related to best practices and
         options for improving the often onerous permitting and registration procedures in
         municipalities in Brazil, which &e among the most important impediments to greater
         development of urban land.


    0    Technical assistanceto strengthen sub-national planningand housingentities. The TAL i s
         limited in scope and reach, but a series of actions will be taken at the Federal level to
         create an environment and the appropriate instruments for building capacity by local
         agents, including municipalities, to implement sector efforts. In addition to subsidy-
         policy specific efforts for local governments and actors financed under Component 3, the
         TAL would finance: (a) technical assistance, including a series of two workshops, also
         involving state-level officials, aimed at the elaboration of cadastre systems, payment
         collection procedures and staff training, including methodologies for systematizing local
         cadastres and facilitating their integration with state and federal databases; (b) a series of
         activities for municipalities to build capacity in identifying and mapping existing
         informal and precarious settlements as well as serviceable land in locations for low-
         income development, in order to define ZEIS perimeters in an equitable and proactive
         way; and (c) the preparation of information for low-cost progressive infrastructure for
         new land subdivision.


    0    Develoument of a National Urban Upgrading program. A number of programs exist at
         the Federal level aimed at the upgrading of existing informal settlements. Rationalizing
         these programs into a single program with consistent rules, adequate targeting and
         monitoring and evaluation, i s a key challenge for the medium term. The TAL would
         finance a number of activities to evaluate the efficacy of these existing programs,
        providing a basis for developing a national urban upgrading program that cuts across all
         secretariats within the Ministry of Cities and that could be supported through the newly
        established        National        Housing        and        Social        Interest        Fund.

Borrower and Executing Agencies

Borrower. A Loan of US$4.0 million will be made to the Federative Republic of Brazil. A front-
end fee of 1% -less any applicable waiver - would be assessed.

Project Implementation. The Project has been designed to be implemented based on the existing
sector institutions and the evolving arrangements for policy management in the housing sector
without creating parallel implementationinstitutions. The National Housing Secretariat within the
Ministry of Cities will be the key implementation agent responsible for day-to-day TAL
management in coordination with the Government's Interministerial Housing Policy Group
(Grupo de Trabalho Interministerial de acompanhamento das Politicas de Financiamento e
Subsidios h Habitaqlio) (GTI-SFH).The GTI-SFHis comprised of representatives of the Central
Bank, Ministry of Finance, Casu Civil da Presidtncia da Repziblica and Ministry of Cities. The
National Housing Secretariat would prepare six-month implementation plans in collaboration
with GTI-SFH. Because of the importance of the finance sector institutions represented on the
GTI-SFH in providing technical oversight and guidance for issues related to Component 2 and
Component 3 of the Project, the GTI-SFH would review technical outputs for consultancies
financed under those components. This i s especially important given the links between the TAL
and a number technical reviews already underway and planned in the housing sectors by the
National Treasury, Ministry of Finance, and Central Bank, in particular.

The key responsibilities of the Project implementation team within the National Housing
Secretariat would include:

        Preparation of the Project's 6-month work plan;
        Management of Project procurement activities, including preparation of terms of
        reference in collaboration with the GTI-SFH for terms of reference related to
        Components 2 and 3 of the Project;
        Project financial management activities, including account management and the
        preparation of Project financial reports;
        Supervision and maintenance of the Project's administrative records;
        Preparation of regular Project implementation information to the World Bank, and
        coordination with the World Bank as regards supervision missions;
        Contracting and provision of information to external auditors; and
        Other ad hoc management and coordination activities, including the preparation of
        workshops and/or training activities.

Procurement. For the purchase of goods or services financed wholly or partly by Bank funds, the
implementation agencies will adhere to the Bank procurement guidelines. Goods will be procured
in accordancewith the Banks "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits"
dated May 2004. Consulting services, either wholly or partly financed by IBRD, will be procured
in accordance with the Banks "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World
Bank Borrowers" datedMay 2004.

Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements

M&E System. The Project would finance a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation program
related to (a) the health of the housing finance sector, including the impact of Government actions
on housing credit availability and cost; (b) the implementation of the Government's housing
subsidy programs, their targeting, efficiency, and impact; and (c) municipal-level actions related
to the availability of housing and land. Details of the monitoring and evaluation approach are
included inAnnex 7 and the overall Project monitoring indicators are included inAnnex 3.

Proiect Supervision. Supervision missions will be undertaken at least three times a year and
Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) will be updated after each mission. Project supervision will
be front-loaded and focus initially on ensuring the preparation of terms of reference for key
studies and consultants. In addition to regular supervision, the Bank will periodically review the
progress of the operation in conjunction with sector reforms under the DPLs. The Ministry of
Cities, in conjunction with the GTI-SFH, will submit quarterly progress reports during project
implementation, includingfinancial monitoring. A mid term review will be carried out in August
2006.

       Annex 7: The Monitoring and Evaluation of the National Housing Policy
                  BRAZIL: HousingSector Technical Assistance Project

Obiectives of the Component. This component seeks to support the National Housing Policy of
Brazil (Politica Nacional de Habitap70, or PNH) in designing and implementing a results-based
monitoring and evaluations system aimed at: (i)      assessing housing needs at the intra municipal
level to facilitate the identification of the target population in each municipality, (ii)
                                                                                         monitoring
implementation and service delivery of PNH's various programs, for quality control,
accountability and legitimacy purposes, and (iii)    assessing program effectiveness and eficiency
via impact assessment and cost effectiveness studies.

The Monitoringand Evaluation System of Brazil's National HousingPolicv. The monitoring and
evaluation system proposed includes four main activities: (a) Intra-Municipal Level Housing
Needs Mapping to improve the targeting of PNH's programs at the municipal level; (b) a
Management Information System to improve effectiveness of program delivery; (c) Processes
Monitoring and Quality Control to ensure accountability and legitimacy; and (d) Impact
Assessment and Cost Effectiveness studies.

Intra-Municipal Level Housing Needs Mapping

The objective of this subcomponent is to provide a tool to municipal authorities to identify areas
within municipalities that are priority for the implementation of PNH's programs (PSH, etc.).
The proposal i s to combine census and national household surveys to estimate housing deficits at
the census segment level. This would serve two purposes: First, it will help municipal
governments in prioritizing the implementationof PNH's programs by targeting geographic areas
in which poor eligible beneficiaries currently reside. Second, by comparing the housing needs
map to the map of the incidence of the PNH programs, the federal government will be able to
monitor the targeting performance of these locally implemented PNH programs. That is,
inconsistencies found between the housing needs map and the actual programs' incidence map
will alert the federal government to inadequate targeting of the intended beneficiary population
by municipal governments.

Specific activities for this subcomponent include: (i)hiring of consultants to elaborate the
housing needs map; (ii)workshop and publications to disseminate results of the housing needs
map; and (iii)  hiringof consultants to develop a web page to make maps available.

Management Information System

The objective of this subcomponent is to assist the Ministries responsible for the PNHprograms
in developing a management information system (MIS) to gather and process real time
information that i s crucial for program management and implementation supervision. Once in
place, the system will be able to instantaneously supply information about various
implementation indicators to the program management teams and policy makers alike. The MIS
will be designed to ensure proper resource use, to facilitate quality control, and to ensure public
accountability. It entails the systematic documentation of key aspects of program performance
that are indicative of whether the program i s functioning as intended or according to some
appropriate standard. Thus, the MIS will be designed to answer questions, for example:


     0  How many individuals (or families) are directly benefiting from the program?
     0  Total number of families that have applied to the program to date?


                                                   35

     0    Total number of beneficiaries receivingprogram benefits?
     0    Amounts transferred per month and per municipality?
     0    Average time elapsed between beneficiary application and selection into the program?
     0    Average time elapsed between beneficiary selection into the program and receipt of
          benefit?
     0    Socio-economic profile of beneficiary households?

The MIS developed under this subcomponent will gather and process information held by
municipal governments and the financial agencies implementing the various programs under the
PNH. Regular newsletters and reports with detailed information on program delivery information
will be prepared and sent to key policy makers at federal, state and municipal levels. A web site
will also be developed to provide real time information on programdelivery and outreach status.

This subcomponent would support the following activities for the setting up of PNH's MIS: (a)
the design, training of staff and implementation of the MIS system; (b) MIS software and
hardware equipment; (c) system maintenance and updating; (d) operational costs for the first 2
and `/z years of the program; (e) training and dissemination workshops for MIS users (including
federal, state and municipal government staff and policy makers).

Processes Monitoring and Quality Control

This subcomponent seeks to strengthen PNH's efficacy by supporting its programs in the area of
quality control audits and the monitoring of downstream processes to ensure accountability,
legitimacy and transparency of programexecution by establishing effective incentive mechanisms
for decentralized implementation. Therefore, this subcomponent will support the design and
execution of random audits at the municipal level to check whether beneficiary selection
procedures follow program guidelines, and if beneficiaries are receiving adequate services. A
random sample of municipalities will be drawn each year. From each municipality, a further
random sample of beneficiary families will be selected to verify the validity of their reported
eligibility, and the quality of the services delivered. The followingquestions will be addressed:


    0    Are those benefitedthe intended target?
    0    Are membersof the targeted population aware of the program, and of programrules?
    0    Are necessary programfunctions beingperformedadequately?
    0    Are beneficiaries receiving the proper amounts, type and quality of service?
    0    Are there eligible targets that are not receiving services?
    0    Are programresourcesused effectively and efficiently?
    0    Are costsper service unit deliveredreasonable?
    0    Are municipalprojects in compliance with requirements imposedby the PNH?
    0    Are participants satisfied with the services they receive?

Specific activities for this subcomponent include: (i)       hiring of consultants to design survey
instruments, sampling strategy, and to implement periodic field surveys in municipalities
randomly selected each year; (ii)   workshop and publications to disseminate results of the quality
control survey; and (iii)  hiring of consultants to develop program re-design strategies to address
implementation issues identified by the quality control survey.

Impact Assessment and Cost Effectiveness studies

An assessment of program effectiveness and efficiency will be conducted to examine the degree
to which the desired outcomes are generatedby the program, and if such outcomes are produced
with the lowest possible costs. Impact assessments cannot be made with certainty but only with
varying degrees of plausibility. Typically, evaluation studies assess the effects of social programs
by comparing information about the outcomes for participants and non-participants. The main
objective of an impact assessment i s to produce estimates of the net effects of an intervention,
that is the impact uncontaminated by the influence of other processes and events that also may
affect outcome indicators.

The main objective of an efficiency assessment is to provide a framework to compare program
costs to outcomes. There are usually two types of efficiency analysis: (i)    cost-benefit analysis,
and (ii)cost-effectiveness analysis. Cost-benefit analysis requires that program costs and
outcomes be known and valued by a common measurement unit (usually monetary units). When
outcomes cannot be converted to monetary units, cost-effectiveness analysis permits interventions
with similar goals to be compared in terms of their relative efficiency. To be feasible, cost-
effectiveness analysis requires that several programs (or interventions) are evaluated for impact.
While most administrative costs are captured by the monitoring systems of the programs
themselves, some non-administrative costs (private or community costs) need to be assessed
through primary data collections.

This sub-component will support PNH's monitoring of outcomes and assessment of program
impacts. At a more aggregate level, the project will support monitoring and impact evaluation of
economic and social indicators, as well as social capital indicators and indicators to measure
municipal level supply of public services that might constrain program effectiveness. The
monitoring and evaluation of outcomes at the municipal level will utilize existing and newly
collected data at the municipal level. Existing data sources include the national population census,
and sample data from large national surveys (e.g., PNAD, POF, PNDS, etc.). The latter will be
usedto estimate key municipal indicators through out of sample imputation methods. The use of
imputation methods will allow for the spatial analysis of poverty and inequality outcomes at the
municipal level before and after program implementation.

At the household level, this subcomponent will support baseline data collection from a sample of
program participants as well as non-participant households. Program participants included in the
sample will be interviewed right after being selected for any of the PNH programs. This will
ensure that sample beneficiary households will be more likely to provide valid information when
answering the baseline survey, since the probability of their receiving the program will not be
affected by their answers to the survey. Comparable non-participant households will also be
interviewed.

The data gathered during this exercise will provide baseline information for the relevant impact
indicators. This subcomponent will also support follow up surveys. If possible, the sample of
non-participant households should be selected from the pool of applicant households that were
registered, but that were not selected into the program because they did not meet the eligibility
criteria. Surveying these excluded households will allow for two valuable types of analysis: (i)  an
assessment of the efficacy of the beneficiary selection process, by verifying if excluded
householdsare in fact less deprived than beneficiaries, and (ii) an assessment of the impact of the
program on household level socio-economic indicators via the method of regression discontinuity
design (see Hahn, Todd and Van der Klaauw, 2001).

Specific activities for this subcomponent include: (i)organization of a Log-Frame workshop to
identify program outcome indicators to be monitored and for which impact will be estimated, (ii)

the design of survey instruments and sampling strategy, and (iii) workshop and publications to
disseminate results of the impact assessment and monitoring studies.

          Annex 8: Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements
                BRAZIL: HousingSector Technical Assistance Project

FinancialManagementandDisbursements

1.      Introduction. The objective of the proposed technical assistance operation is to assist in
the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Government reform program supported by
the housing sector reforms under the Programmatic Development Policy Loan. The project will
be implemented by the National Secretariat for Housing, which is part of the Ministry of Cities,
through its Unidade de Gerenciamento de Projectos (UGP),an entity already experienced in the
implementation of multilateral development agencies operations.

2.      Financial Management Assessment Conclusion. A financial management assessment of
the Housing Technical Assistance Loan was conducted on March 15 and 16, 2005. The
assessment was carried out in accordance with OP/BP 10.02 and the Guidelines for Assessment
of Financial Management Arrangements in World Bank Financed Projects issued by the Financial
Management Sector Board on October 15,2003.

3.      The overall objective of the assessment was to determine whether the Borrower has, or
will have, acceptable financial management arrangements in place by loan effectiveness. These
include, but are not limited to, capacity to (a) properly manage and account for all program's
proceeds, expenditures and transactions; (b) produce timely, accurate, and reliable program
financial statements and reports, including Financial Monitoring Reports (FIWRs), for general and
Bank special purposes; (c) safeguard program's assets; (d) timely engage independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank; and (e) disburse Bank funds in accordance to applicable Bank rules and
procedures.

4.      The assessment was carried out jointly with the National Secretariat for Housing's UGP
staff members involved inthe implementationof the program. It included (a) discussions with the
UGP's financial management staff and STN officials; (b) a review of evaluation of financial
management systems in place andor those to be used for the program's monitoring, accounting,
and reporting; (c) review of staffing requirements, including training and qualifications;
(d) discussion of flow of funds arrangements and disbursement methodology; (e) review of
internal control mechanisms in place; (f) discussion with regard to reporting requirements,
includingthe format and content of FMRs; and (g) review of external audit arrangements.

5.      Financial management arrangements for federal projects in the country rely on the
Government's Sistema Zntegrado de Administrag&           Financeira (SIAFI). The system can
adequately manage and track the receipt and use of funds, in a highly transparent manner, with a
low risk for Bank and country funds.

6.      The overall Financial Management Assessment conclusion is that the National Secretariat
for Housing, namely its UGP, has satisfactory financial management arrangements in place to
meet the Bank's minimum requirements. The financial management risk associated with the
Project has been assessed as low. The Project's financial management system i s able to provide
relevant and reliable financial information, in a timely manner, and to support the project's
management in the control, planning, implementation and monitoring of the project, towards the
achievement of its objectives.




                                                39

7.      Financial Management Systems and Reporting. Project expenditures will be recorded -
budgeted, committed and paid - in SIAFI, the Federal Government's public financial management
system. A new Unidade Gestora will be opened specifically for the project in the SIAFI system,
which will produce monthly lists of payments and reports by expenditure, to be used as the basis
for disbursements. For monitoring purposes, and given that the Loan Agreement will have a
single disbursement category, agreement was reached during negotiations on the Financial
Monitoring Reports (FMRs) format. FMRs will be produced, on a spreadsheet, every quarter,
providing the following data: FMR 1A - Sources and Uses of Funds, by disbursement category,
cumulative (project-to-date; year-to-date and for the period) and budgeted vs. actual expenditures,
including a variance analysis; FMR 1B - Uses of Funds by Project Activity or Component,
cumulative (project-to-date; year-to-date and for the period, by financing source) and budgeted
vs. actual expenditures, including a variance analysis; Physical Progress Report: FMR 2 -
MonitoringPerformance Indicators. Formats for Procurement monitoring and physical progress
have also been agreed upon by the Bank and Government and would be used during
implementation.

8.      Supervision. Financial management supervision will take place at least once a year and
include (a) reviewing of FMRs; (b) reviewing of the auditors' reports and follow-up of issues
raised by auditors in the management letter, as appropriate; (c) participation in project
supervision; (d) following up on any financial reporting and disbursement issues; and (e)
updatingthe financial managementrating inthe Implementation Status Report (ISR).

9.      Disbursements. Payments will be made directly to consultants and suppliers by the UGP,
using the SUFI system. Funds will be transferred from the single treasury account to the payee,
upon instructions from the UGP. On a monthly basis, the UGP will extract, from SIAFI, a list of
payments, ordens bancririas, and a summary of Project expenditures. These two reports will be
accompanied, as applicable, by invoices for payments made for contracts above the Bank's prior
review threshold and will be submitted to the Bank via Secretaria Nacional do Tesouro (STN) of
the Ministry of Finance. The Bank will then reimburse STN on the basis of such reports, which
will support the withdrawal application. The Bank will finance one hundred percent of eligible
expenditures, including taxes, in accordance with the recently approved country financing
parameters.

10.     Accounting Basis, Procedures and Policies. Project financial statements will be prepared,
on a cash accounting basis, quarterly and annually. These statements will be prepared in
accordance with consistently-applied accounting standards as per Law 4.320, acceptable to the
Bank.

11.     Auditing Arrangements. Annual project financial statements will be audited by
independent auditors, satisfactory to the Bank, in accordance with acceptable auditing standards.
In principle, the Secretaria Federal de Controle, (SFC) an entity duly recognized by the Bank,
will undertake the project's annual financial audits. The external audit will be conducted in line
with Terms of Reference acceptable to the Bank, and auditors will be required to issue a single
opinion on project's financial statements, as per the guidelines "Annual Financial Reporting and
Auditing for World Bank-financed activities", of June 30, 2003. Auditors will also have to
produce a management letter, where relevant intemal control weaknesses will be identified and
properly followed up by the UGP, contributing to the strengthening of the control environment.
The auditor's report will be submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the closing of the
borrower's fiscal year.

                                     Annex 9: Procurement
                   BRAZIL: HousingSector Technical Assistance Loan

General

 1.      Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May
2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The general description of various
items under different expenditure category is described below. For each contract to be financed
by the Loan, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for
prequalification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed between
the Borrower and the Bank project team in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be
updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and
improvements in institutional capacity.

2.      Procurement of Works. There will be no procurement of works inthis project.

3.      Procurement of Goods. This project is expected to have a very low volume of
procurement of goods. There will be purchase of computer equipment and software which shall
be procuredthrough ``preg6o eletr6nico" (reverse auction) if the amount involved falls below the
shopping threshold. In addition, small contracts for procurement of printing services are also
planned. No National Competitive Bidding (NCB) for procurement of goods was identified
during preparation. If necessary during implementation, procurement will be done using the
Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs) for all ICB and the model bidding documents
publishedby SEAINfor NCB.

4.      Procurement of non-consulting services. No contract of non-consultingservices was
identified.

5.      Selection of Consultants. Project design shows a high volume of consultant contracts,
mainly for technical assistance, marketing and communication plans, development of a
monitoring and evaluation system, design of toolkits, and development of national urban
upgrading program, among others. Some smaller studies are likely to be done by individuals.
Short lists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than $500,000 equivalent per contract
may be composed entirely of national consultants in accordance with the provisions of paragraph
2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines.

Assessment of the agency's capacity to implement procurement

6.      Procurement activities will be carried out by the Ministe`rio dus Cidudes. An assessment
of the capacity of the Implementing Agency to implement procurement actions for the project has
been carried out by Alexandre Borges de Oliveira on November 17,2004 and later discussed with
the client on March 18, 2005.         The assessment reviewed the organizational structure for
implementing the Project and the interaction between the Project's staff responsible for
procurement.

7       The major issued identified i s the lack of specialized procurement staff in the
implementing agency. An action plan was agreed to during project preparation to strengthen the
procurement team.



                                                 42

   The overall project riskfor procurement is average.

   Procurement Plan

   8.       The Borrower, at Appraisal, developed a Procurement Plan for project implementation
   which provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been agreed between the
   Borrower and the Project Team on March 30, 2005 and is available at the Ministe`rio dus Cidudes
   and the Bank CMU files. It will also be available in the Project's database and on the Bank's
   external website. The Procurement Plan will be updated annually in agreement with the Project
   Team or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in
   institutional capacity.

   Frequency of Procurement Supervision

   9.       In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the
   capacity assessment of the ImplementingAgency has recommended two post-reviews for the first
   year of project implementationand annually from there on.

     agenda de reformas microecon6micas, destinada a promover o aumento da produtividade da
     economia brasileira e o crescimento eqtiitativo Nesse contexto, a fim de apoiar o
     financiamento do seu esforgo de reformas para o setor habitacional, o Govemo Brasileiro
     solicitou a0 Banco Mundial umprograma de Emprktimos paraPolitica de Desenvolvimento
     (DPLs). Essas reformas h e m parte do grupa de atividades que o Banco Mundlal vem
     apoiando na kea de Crescimento Eqtiitativo e Sustentado, CUJO primeiro empristimo foi
     aprovado noan0 passado.

       5.      As questbes referent- B politica e financiamento habitacional no Brasil em sido
       responsabilidadede vhias aghcias govemamentais, o que requeruna coordena@oentre elas.
       Nesse contexto, o Governo tomou importantes medidas, comepndo com a cria@o do
       Ministerio das Cidades (Lei 10.683, de 28 de maio de 2003) e sua Secretaria Nacional da
       Habitago, como 6r@o federal responsive1pela politica habitacional, seus programase aq6es.
       Outras medidas form adotadas, visando assegurar a capacidade tknica e administrativa da
       Secretaria Nacional da Habitago, incluindo: (a) a criafio de unidade tknica para elaborar,
       monitorar e avaliar o Plan0Nacional de Habitago e (b) a contratago de pessoal/consultores
       paraasseguraradequadacapacidadetecmca intema.

       6      Com a criaflo do Minist6rio das Cidades, o Govemo, em colaboraflo corn amplos
       setores da sociedade civil, avanpu na prepara@o de sua politica habitacional, visando
       estabelecer as wordenadas da aq5.o governamental que assegure o acesso da popula@o a
       moradia adequada. Esseesforp resultounapublicaqiZo, em 2004, pelo Mhkterio das Cidades,

       para o setor, alem de propostas para sua implementaflo. Ajustes provavelmente oconerZo
       durante o process0 de imp1ementaR.oda politica e de sua consoiidaqiio efetiva por meio de lei
       e deplan0 de investimentospiunanualcontendo objetwos, metase mdicadores.

       7.       Em consonhcia com esse esforvo, o Congress0Nacional est&apreciandoProjeto de
       L e i que cria o Fundo Nacional para Habitaqiio de Interesse Social (FNHIS), para coordenar
       transferhhs, subsidios, recursose hanciamento a politica de habitaeo. 0 Projeto de Leifoi
       aprovado pela Gmara dos Deputados e aguarda sua aprovaglo pel0 Senado. A criaglo do
       Fundo representauma tentativa de articular os recursos orptnenthrios utilizados para fins de
       politica habitacional e de aumentar sinergias entre programas financiados pel0 setor pcblico.
       No curto prazo, e ap6s a aprovaeo pelo Congress0 Nacional, sera necesdrio regulamentara
       operacionalizaqtio e funcionamento do FNHIS, defmindo sua esmtura de gestFio e
       promovendo incluso progressivados subsidios orgamenthos nesta unica estrutura, na forma
       definida em lei.

     8       Para consolidar a colabora@o e coordenago entre os entes envolvidos, o Govemo
     cnou um Grupo Interministerial de Acompanhamento das Politicas de Financiamento e
     Subsidios Habitaeo, que acompanhara os componentes da Politica Habitacional nas bases
                 I#
     de mercado e de interesse social, assim como os trabalhos desenvolvidos com apoio do
i    emprhtimode assistkncia tknica doBancoMundialparao setor

     9        Para reforgar a capacidade de imp1ementaG.odessas politicas, o Govemo lanpu urn
     programa abrangente de capacitago, visando o fortalecimento dos municipios na operago de
     programas e politicas do Minist6rio das Cidades. Esta a@o esti sendo acompanhada de
     medidas para mapear e avaliar a capacidade das aghcias sub-nacionais envolvidas com
     planejamento e politica habitacional. Finalmente, estamos reforgando as atividades
     institucionais e de treinamento em municipios, com foco em instrumentos e pdticas de
     politicas urbanasehabitacionais.

     Ampliando o FinanciamentoHabitacional

     10.      0 financiamepto habitacional e um dos pilares para a promqLo de amplo acesso a
     habitago. No Brasil, grandes reformas tbm sido feitas nos ulhmos anos para estimular o
     desenvolvimentode mercados secundhrios e a emissao de papeis securitizados quepodem ser
     transacionados no mercado com seguranp e lucratividade. Nossa experikncia tem sido bem
     sucedida. Embora o mercado de titulos lastreados em financiamento habitacional seja alnda
     incipiente, apresentaum forte potencia1de crescimento, o qualdeve aumentar paripassu com
     a consolida@o da melhora das condiqaes macroeconbmicasque temos observadonos ultimos
     meses Importantesmedidas foram tomadas para estimular a canaliza@o de poupanp para o
     setor, tal como a aprovaw da Lei 10.931, que inclui: (a) o fortalecimento da aliena@o
     fidziciuria (criada em 1997,Lei 9.514) como um sistemaaltematrvo de garantia; (b) o reforp
     do grau de confianp das instit&bes    de crkhto interessadas em financiamento habitacional,
     tomando possivel regdamentar titulos de credito imobiliirio (CRI e LCI); (c) a
     regulamenta@odoPatrim6nio deAfeta@o em incorpora@s imobiliarias; (d) a introdug5o de
     meios eficazes de fiscalizagiio, tomando vihvel a continuidadedos trabalhosde construg50, em
     cas0 de filBncia dos empreendedores; (e) a simpllficagfio do imposto incidente sobre as
     receitas do Patrimbnio de AfetaHo, mediante instituiflo do Reghe de T r i b u w o Especial
     (RTE), corn agmpamento de taxas e conmbuipks federais em uma imica aliquota; e (9 a
     regulamenta@oda solu@o de disputasIegaiscontroversas.

      11     Alem disso, o Govemo instituiu reformas legais que permitem aos credoressecuritizar
     seus emprbtimos habitacionais e fhcilitar a cria@o de companhias privadas de securitiza@o,
     assim como, estabeleceu arcabougo legal para os instrumentos do mercado de titulos

     Recomprade CWs-Certjcado de Recebnieis Imobiliarios- foi criada pelaRes.3155/2003,
     derivativos de emprktimos lastreados em garantia imobiliaria (CRT). A Carta de Garantia de

     do Conselho Monetfirio Nacional (CMN), com o objetivo de aumentar a liquidez desses
     titulos, melhorandoa seguraqa dos detentores dos creditos e estimulando a expansb de um
     mercado secundirrio de hipotecas. Finalmente, as Leis 11.053/04 e 11.033/04 hcilitam o
     desenvolvimento do mercado de papels lastreados em garantias imobiliirias, pot incluir
     mcentivos fiscais para fundos mutuos e de pensgo na compra de papeis de Iongo prazo, alkm
     de instituir a isen@o de imposto de rendapara invesbdores de varejo que tenham papeiscom
     lastroem credito imobiliirio (LH,LCIe CRI).

  12.     Como proposito de consolidare expandir o mercado, o Govemo pretendecontinuar o
  aprimoramento do arcaboup legal, apresentando propostas para reduzir o nsco juridic0 dos
  contratosde credit0 imobilifrrio e promover a institui@o de umbancode dados de prot@o ao
  consumidor(cadaszroposirivo), contemplandoos mutuirios do setor habitacional.Alem disso,
  pretende-se estudar o potencial de desenvolvimento do seguro de crklito e trabalhar com o
  Iudiciario para refletir conjuntamentesobre as condiges especificasdo mercado babitacional
  e a necessidadede reforgar os contratosmmo medidavital paraque o mercadofloresqa.

  13.     A consolidaeo da estabilidade macroeconBmica e as reformas de carkter
  microecon6mico que v6m sendo adotadasja contribuem e VZO certamenteproporcionar um
  ambiente amda mais favorhvel a uma maior participwiio dos bancos privados no
  financiamento habitacional, tomando mais interessante para o setor financeiro conceder
  financiamentoshabitacionais.

  14.     Durante esse period0 de consolida@o de reformas, o mercado financeiro habitacional
  de longo prazo requer regulamentagiioe protqiio adequada. Os dois segmentos de mercado
.&ue contabilizam mais de 75% do mercado habitacional incluem o SBPE e o FGTS. 0
  primeiro tem suprido cera de 25% dos emprdstimoshabitacionais.Financiado por cademetas
  de poupanpa, que deshtam de isenqZode impostos, o SBPE (Sistema Brasileiro de Poupanqa
  eEmprestimo)tem ti suadisposipo um grande volume de recursos, parcialmentedirecionados
 para empr&timos habitacionais. Dada a baixa lucratividade relativa desses creditos e a ainda
  pequena atuago dos bancos privados nesse segmento, o Conselho Monetirio Nacional
  determinou um aumento na aplicaflo em emprbtimos habitacionas dos recursos captados
  pela poupanpa, bem como instituiu mecanismos de monitoramento para que os bancos
  atendam a essa deter"a@o.          Acreditamos que, no futuro, tal sistema niio seja mais
  necesskio, quando as condiges permitirem sua integra@o ao sistema de mercado. Mais
  recentemente, a Resolu@o 3.259, de janeiro de 2005, compatibilizou as obrigatoriedadesde
  aplicaflo em crMito imobilihioa capacidade do mercado de produzir unidadeshabitacionais,
  e definiu mcentivos para o financiamento a im6veis para a populapo de baixa renda ou de
  baixo valor.

  15.     0Fundode GarantiadoTempo deServip (FGTS) permanecerhsendo, mesmoemum
  horizonte mais longo, uma fonte importante de financiamento para habitaflo social. Ele
  responde por maisde metade do total de crditos habitacionais e e intenqiiodo Govemo fod-
  l o na populaflo de baixa renda, mantendo sua lucratividade e seguranqa.No passado recente,
  o FGTS melhorou seus procedimentos de gestiio de forma notivel pela inclusiio do dlculo
  explicit0 dos subsidios que concede nos financiamentos habitacionais (Resoiu$o         460,
  CCFGTS). Alem disso, determinou que, por volta de 2008, todos os recursos do FGTS
  beneficiario familias com menos de 10 salkrios minimos (SM), aumentando, ja em 2005, a
  quantiade cr6dito disponivel parafamilias derendainferiora 6 SM

  16.     No curto prazo, o Govemo continuani empenhado em assegurar uma gestfio eficiente
  do FGTS, no seu duplo papel de findo providente e de fonte de financiamento habitacional,
  procurandoexplorar op~$es que estimulem o us0 de tais recursospor umgrupo mais amplo de
  institui9es financeiras.

Melhorando a Eficihcia dos Subsidios para HabitaGo

17     Pela primeira vez, o Govemo criou um programa de subsidio dueto e antecipado. 0
Programade Subsidio a HabitaqZo de Interesse Social (PSH) tem sido muito bem sucedido e
um programatransparente de subsidos antecipados; que prev8 um sistema de IeilLo pbblico
paraa distnbuieo de recursosdo PSH, com o proposito de expandir o universode instituiqBes
financeiras participantes; financiado com recursos do orpnento federal (OGU); e que vem
sendo aprimorado ao longo do tempo. As melhoras iniciadas recentemente, entre outros
objetivos, visam expandir o universo de instituig6es Gnanceiras participantes. Est50 sendo
estudados mecanismos que proporcionern um ambiente mas competitivo p w agentes de
credit0 e produtos alternativos, por meio de: (a) estabelecimento de um sistema de pr6-
qualificaeo de agentes financehos, incluindo companhias do setor publico local e (b)
melhoria do processo de credenciamento tkuco, para eliminar o risco de possiveis praticas
desleais ou ilegais

18.     No futuro imediato, o Govemo continuara os esforgos para racionalizar e coordenar os
programas de subsidio. A harmonizafio de Go diversos programas como OS subsidlos do
FGTS,PAR,PSHeoutros, deve contemplar questces relativas a beneficiosporfaixade renda
e criterios de acesso, entre outras. Como inovaeo recente, pode-se ressaltar a aprovago da
Resolu@o 460 pelo Conselho Curador do FGTS, que estabeleceu uma nova politica de
subsidiosantecipados, prevendoa afocaQo de R$1,2 bilMo para 2005, segundo cderios bem
definidos para sele@o de beneficihrios, e contemplandoa possibilidade de conceder subsidios
paraaquisiqiiode imoveis usados.

19.     A agenda de curto prazo inclui a harmonizaeo do sistema de subsidios, melhona de
focalhaglo dos programas e a preparaflo de arcaboup para o sistema de Monitoramento e
Avaliago do ProgramaHabitacional do Govemo, comparticular ateneo aos componentes de
subsidios.

ReduqHodo Custo da Formalidadee Aumento dr Oferta de SoloUrbano

20.     Os obsticulos a uma oferta mais adequada de terra a preps acessiveis para a
populagio de baixa renda continuam a ser um grande problema Aspectos da pr6pria
legislafio, bem como de processos de registros, dificultam as apks de promogo da
ampliaeo da oferta de terra pel0 mercado formal. 0 Govemo empreendeu um processo de
consultapublica e apoiou o delineamento da proposta de nova lei de parcelamento do solo e
regular@o      fundifiria para Areas urbanas. Conhecido como "Lei de Responsabilidade
Territorial", esse PL pretende promover avangos a partir do arcabougo legal do Estatuto da
Cidade, constituiudo o novo mano regulatorio da produqLo e regulariza@o de assentamentos
humanosnopais.

21.     AIem disso, o Govemo lanqou um programa de apoio ao desenvolvlmento de planos
urbanisticos mmcipais incluindo: (a) o desenvolvimentode umconjunto de ferramentas para
preparago de planos diretores, no contexto do Estatuto da Cidade; (b) o desenvolvimentode
um banco de dados nacional de consultores qualificados para dar suporte aos municipios, na
preparaqBode pIanos diretoresparticipativos; e (c)a alocaqHo de verbas do OGU paraapolar o
desenvolvimentode planosdiretores participativos.

,
        22.     No mdio prazo, o Govemo devera langar um programa de integra@o urbana de
        assentamentos preduios em areas metropolitanas, onde se encontram90% dos assentamentos
        informais. Relativamentea politica de desenvoIvimento urbano, o Govemo deveri incluir no
        Plano Nacional de Habita@io   diretrizes de politica para estimular a oferta de tem urbana,

                                                                              Brasilia, May 06, 2005

MrJames Wolfensohn
President
World Bank
Washington D.C.

Dear Mr.President

1.      The Government of President Luis Inacio da Silva has been implementing an important
program of microeconomic reforms aimed at promoting an increase in economic productivity and
equitable growth of the Brazilian economy.         In this context, the Brazilian Government has
requested from the World Bank a program of Development Policy Loans (DPLs) to support the
financing of its housing sector reform. This reform program is part of the activities that the Bank
i s supporting in the area of Sustainable and Equitable Growth and whose first loan was approved
last year.

2.       The present administration has given a noticeable importance to the low income housing
sector as a result of the impact that shelter has in the daily lives of the lowest income groups, as
well as in the creation of jobs and in the promotion of economic activity. Below you will find the
most important measures already taken, or to be taken, to address the main issues afflicting the
housing sector in Brazil.

3.       The Government i s aware of the enormous challenges ahead. Brazil's housing deficit i s
estimated at about 7 million units; 88% of this deficit i s concentrated in families earning less than
5 minimumwages. These numbers will not decline if we fail to address the excess of demand for
housing services generated by the new households. A significant portion of the households
formed every year cannot afford even the least expensive market-built house and turn to the
informal housingmarkets.

4.       The Government has identified four areas where measures and reforms are crucial to
increase the access of the poor to adequate shelter.         First, the Government i s working to
strengthen the institutions dealing with the sector as well as their capacity of coordination, based
on adequate statistics and sound and detailed analysis so as to define a medium term plan with
clear priorities and within realistic financial targets. Second, the Government i s committed to
produce a greater integration of the housing finance sector supported by the consolidation of the
macroeconomic stabilization and the structural reforms which will lead to a consistent reduction
of the basic interest rates and the financial intermediation spreads. The Government strategy i s in
the short run to improve the situation of the housing financing system, promoting greater



                                                  49

efficiency among financial agents, harmonizing implicit and explicit subsidies, and creating
mechanisms of credit insurance that protect both lenders and borrowers. Inthis way, we will be
creating the conditions to reach in the future a greater integration in the housing finance markets.
Third, the Government will continue its efforts to modernize the housing finance sector and the
capital market instruments in order to increase the volume of resources to the sector and allow a
gradual reorientation to the lower income classes. Fourth, the Government i s working to improve
the supply of formal urbanized land. Many of the challenges are found at the level of state and
municipal governments, in particular in the supply of urban land, includingformalities in titling
and subdivision, construction licenses, urbanand environment licensing.

InstitutionalStrengthening

5.      Housing policy and housing finance issues have been the function of several government
agencies which require an effective coordination. In this context, the Government has taken
important measures, beginning with the creation of the Ministry of Cities and its Housing
Secretariat. (Law 10.683,. May 28, 2003) and the creation of the National Housing Secretariat as
the Federal agency responsible for the development, execution and monitoring of housing sector
policy, programs and actions.       We have taken further steps to ensure the technical and
administrative capacity of the National Housing Secretariat, including, inter alia: (a) the creation
of a technical unit to design the housing plan and conduct the associated monitoring and
evaluation and (b) the contracting of staffkonsultants to ensure adequate in-house technical
capacity.

6.     With the creation of the Ministry of Cities, the Government in collaboration with large
groups of civil society has advance in the preparation of its National Housing Policy, aiming at
establishing the coordinates of the Government policy to guarantee the Brazilian population the
access to adequate shelter. This effort has let to the publication by the Ministry of Cities of the
National Housing Policy document in 2004 defining the main principles and guidelines for the
sector as well as the proposals for its implementation. Adjustments will likely take place during
the implementation of the housing policy and of its effective consolidation through its law and the
multi-year national plan comprising objectives, targets and indicators.

7.        Inparallel and as a complement to that effort, the National Congress is reviewing a
Project Law which creates the National Social Interest Housing Fund (FNHIS) to coordinate
transfers, subsidies, financial resources and funding to support the housing policy. The Projeto
de Lei was approved by the House of Representatives and awaits its approval in the Senate. The
creation of this Fundrepresents an attempt to homogenize the way resources are used for housing
policy purposes and to increase synergies between programs financed by the public sector. Inthe
near term, and after the approval by the National Congress, it will be necessary to regulate the
functioning of the FNHIS, defining its management structure, and promoting a progressive
inclusion of all budget subsidies inthis single structure, as defined by the law.

8.      To ensure the collaboration and coordination of the program, the Government has created
an Inter-ministerial Group to follow the Housing Finance and Subsidy Policy that will follow the
market-basedand subsidy components of the HousingPolicy as well as the work developed under
the Bank-financed Technical Assistance Loanfor the sector.

9.        To strengthen the implementation capacity of these policies, the Government has
launched a comprehensive capacity building program aimed at the institutional strengthening of
municipalities in the operation of programs and policies of the Ministry of Cities. This action has
been accompanied by measures to map and assess the capacity of the sub-national agencies


                                                 50

involved with housing planning and policy. Finally, we are strengthening the institutional and
training activities in municipalities in metropolitan regions focused on instruments and practices
in urban andhousingpolicies.

AmplifyingHousingFinance

10.        Housing finance i s one of the pillars to promote wider access of housing. In Brazil,
major reforms have been undertaken in the last years to promote the development of secondary
markets and the issuing of securitization papers that can be traded in the market with confidence
and profitability. Our experience has been quite successful. Although the housing capital market
i s still limited, it has great growth potential which will materialize pari passu with the
consolidation and improvement of the macroeconomic conditions as observed in the last months.
Important measures have been taken so far to channel savings to this sector, such as the approval
of Law 10931, which includes (a) the strengthening of alienapo Jiduciaria (the trust deed
instrument, created in 1997, Law 9514) as an alternative mode of collateralization; (b) the
strengthening of credit institutions interested on housing financing, makingit possible to regulate
real estate credit titles (CRI and LCI); (c) regulation of the PatrimBnio de AfetaGa'o ("affected
assets") at real estate developments; (d) introduction of efficacious means of inspection and
making feasible the continuity of the construction works in case of the developers' bankruptcy;
(e) simplification of the tax over the revenues of Patrimonio de AfetaGa`o, through the creation of
the Special Tax Regimen (RET - Regime Especial de Tributaqco); grouping federal taxes in a
single tax aliquot; and (f)regulationof the solution of controversiallegal disputes.

11.      In addition, the Government instituted legal reforms which allow lenders to securitize
their housing loans, facilitate the creation of private securitization companies, and establish legal
framework for capital market instruments (CRI) for mortgage derivatives. Trust Letters for the
repurchase of CRI's - Certificados de Cre`ditoZmobilia`rio - were created by Res.3155/2003 of
the National Monetary Council `(CMN), aimed at increasing the liquidity of these titles,
improving the security of credit holders, and stimulating the expansion of a secondary mortgage
market. Finally, Laws 11.053/04 and 11.033/04 facilitate the development of mortgage securities,
including tax incentives for mutual and pension funds to purchase long term securities, in
addition to implement income tax exemptions for retail investors holding SFI paper (LH, LCI,
and CRI).

 12.     With the objective of developing and expanding the market, the Government intends to
continue improving the regulatory framework, presenting proposals to reduce the judicial risk of
the housingcredit contracts and promote the establishment of a data bank for consumer protection
(positive cadastre) aiming at the housing sector clients. In addition, the Government intends to
study the potential to develop risk insurance and to work with the Judiciary to analyze jointly the
specific conditions of the housing market and to assess the need to enforce the contracts as a vital
measurefor the market to flourish.

 13.     The consolidation of the macroeconomic stability and the microeconomic reforms that
have been implemented already contribute and will certainly create an environment more
favorable to a larger participation of the private banks in housing finance, making it more
interesting for the financial sector to lend for housing relatedproducts.

 14.     During this period of consolidation of reforms in the sector, the long-term housing
finance will require adequate regulation and protection.. The two segmented markets that account
for more than 75% of the hosing market include SPBE and FGTS. The first has been providing
around 25% of housing loans. Funded by tax free saving accounts, SBPE system (Sistema


                                                  51

Brasileiro de Poupanca e Emprestimo)has at its disposal a large volume of resources which have
been partially oriented for housing loans. Given the relatively lower profitability of such credits,
and sill limited role of the private banks in that segment, the Monetary Council has determined an
increase in the application of funds to housing loans as well as the monitoring mechanisms to
ensure that banks follow those rules. We believe that in the medium-term, this system would no
longer be needed, when the conditions will allow its integration in the full market system. More
recently, Resolution 3.259 of January 2005 has established an adequate degree of allocation to
housing finance in line with the sector capacity to produce housing units while defining the
incentives to finance low income groups and low housingvalue.

15.      FGTS (Fundo de Garantia do Tempo de SewiGo) will remain an important source of
financing for social housing probably even in a longer horizon. It accounts for more than half of
total housing exposure and it i s the intention of the Government to focus it to low income
populations while maintaining its profitability and security. In the recent past, the FGTS have
improved management procedures, notably by including explicit upfront calculation of the cost
and risk to lenders of the FGTS interest rate subsidy program differentiated by income group
(Resolution 460, CCFGTS). In addition, it determined that, by 2008, all FGTS resources will
benefit households earning less than 10 minimumwages, increasing in 2005 the amount of credit
available for households earningless than 6 MW.

16.      In the short term the Government will remain committed to ensure an efficient
management of the FGTS, in its double role of provident fund and source of housing finance,
looking for alternatives that promote the use of these resources by a wider group of financial
institutions.


Improvingthe Efficiencyof HousingSubsidies

17.      For the first time, the Government has created a program of upfront subsidies. The
Social Housing Program (PSH) has been very successful. It i s a transparent upfront subsidy
program financed from Federal budget resources (OGU) which includes a system of public
auction in the allocation of its resources with the objective of expanding the universe of
participating financial institutions and which has been improved over time. Improvements
recently undertaken include, inter-alia, the expansion of the universe of participating financial
institutions. Other mechanisms are being studied to create a more competitive environment for
alternative lenders and products by (a) establishing an improved system of pre-qualification of
lenders and other agents, including local public sector companies and (b) further improvement of
the technical accreditation process to reduce the risk of underbidding and possible unfairhllegal
practices.

18.      In the very near future, the Government will continue its efforts to rationalize and
coordinate subsidy programs. The harmonization of very different programs such as the subsidies
of FGTS, PAR, PSH and others should address questions related to benefits by income level,
procedures to access subsidy funds, and others. As recent innovation, we mention the approval of
Resolution 460 of the Board of Directors of FGTS which established a new policy of FGTS
upfront subsidies with an allocation of R$1.2 billion for 2005 with well-defined criteria for the
selection of beneficiaries and inclusion of the subsidy component for existing houses.

19.      The near-term agenda includes harmonization of the subsidy framework, improved
targeting of both programs and Preparation of a Framework for the Monitoring and Evaluation




                                                   52

system of the Housing Program of the Government, with particular attention to the Subsidies
component.


Reducethe Cost of Formalityand ImproveSupply of UrbanLand

20.      Constraints to an adequate land supply, especially at affordable prices for low income
people continue to be a major problem in attempting to provide universal shelter. Aspects of the
legislation itself, as well as registry system, impede the action of the Federal and the local
governments to provide formal land on-time. The Government has championed the public
consultation process and supported the drafting of a new land law, known as the Law of
Temtorial Responsibility, which aims to promote advances based on the new legal framework of
Estututo du Cidude,becoming the new regulatory framework for the production and regulation of
urban settlements inBrazil.

21.      Moreover, the Government has launched a program to support the development of
strategic municipal plans including: (a) the development of a toolkit for the preparation of master
plans within the framework of the City Statute; (b) the development of a national database of
qualified consultants for providing support to municipalities in preparing participatory urban
strategic plans; and (c) providing budget resources to municipalities for the development of their
participatory urban plans.

22.      In the medium term, the Government will launch a program of urban integration and
upgrading in the metropolitan areas, where there are 90% of the informal settlements. In relation
to the urban development policy, the Government will include in the National Housing Plan the
policy guidelines to stimulate the use of urban land, defining the instruments and incentives for
the municipal governments and other agents to reduce the administrative costs to access the
formal housingmarket and urbanized land.

FinancialAssistanceRequest

23.      The reform agenda and the initiatives described above indicate the strong commitment of
the Brazilian Govemment'to the housing sector. Inthis context, the Government is grateful of the
Bank's participation in the financing of the reform program described above and the supported
provided through the Development Policy Lending. We wish to continue working with the Bank
in future programmatic' loans aimed at the sustainable and equitable growth of the Brazilian
Economy and the provision of adequate shelter and housing services for most of its inhabitants.

                  Annex 13: Summary of Social and Environmental Issues
                  BRAZIL: HousingSector Technical Assistance Project


The proposed TAL, and associated DPL will support government policy efforts in the areas o f
institutional reform and support of the national housing policy; housing finance and market
reforms; low-income housing subsidy policy; and land and urban development legal and
institutional frameworks. The reforms supported in this program are intended to increase access
of poor and moderate income families to formal sector housing - including finished housing,
urbanized land, and the upgrading of informal settlements. These are all actions that would have
potential substantial positive environmental and social impacts. A rapid environmental and social
assessment of the main issues addressed in the program was commissioned. This Annex presents
a summary of the findings.

EnvironmentalLegalandInstitutionalFramework

Brazil's legal and institutional framework concerning the environment i s substantially advanced
compared with many other developing countries and is adequate for regulating and reviewing the
kindof localized environmental impacts that are associatedwith urban development and housing
policies and programs.

The Federal Constitution establishes the legislative and administrative competencies regarding
the natural environment, providing for (i)   the Union to legislate general environmental norms of a
national interest; (ii)the states to legislate norms of state level interest; and (iii)
                                                                                     municipalities to
legislate norms of local interest.      States and municipalities, therefore, have competency to
legislate over environmental matters, provided that such legislation i s not in conflict with federal
law. The Constitution further requires, in paragraph 1 of Article 225 that any public works or
activities that may cause significant environmental degradation must first be subject to a study of
the environmental impacts, thus laying the basis for the environmental licensingprocess.

Federal law 6.938 of August 31, 1981 established the National Environmental Policy (PNMA).
The law was regulated by Decree No. 99.274 of June 6, 1990 (altered in 1991and 2001). Among
the preventive instruments established in the policy, and of relevance to the urban and housing
sectors, are the establishment of environmental quality parameters, environmental zoning and
assessment of environmental impacts. This law also defined the National Environmental System
(SISNAMA),together with the institutionsresponsible for protecting environmental quality:


    0    Ministry of Environment, responsible for planning, coordinating, supervising and
         controlling environmentalpolicy at the federa1,level;
    0    The Brazilian Institute of Environment and Natural Resources(IBAMA);
    0    State institutions responsible for controlling and overseeing activities that can cause
         environmental degradation; and
    0    Municipal organizations or institutions to control and oversee activities that can cause
         environmental degradation at the local level.

Environmental licensing i s the most relevant instrument for environmental management at the
local level. The National Environmental Council (CONAMA) edited resolutions No. 237 of
December 19, 1997, altering Resolution No. 001/86, in order to more systematically treat the
environmental licensing process.         This defines works and activities that are subject to
environmental licensing. Among those relevant to the housing and urban development area are:



                                                  54

land subdivision, treatment and disposition of urban solid waste, activities related to water and
waste water services. While the institutional and legal frameworks are adequate, in practice there
are often conflicts betweenjurisdictions and capacity, particularly at the local level various from
place to place. These problems are prevalent in the urban realm, particularly in the approval of
subdivisions, social housing projects and the regularization of informal settlements. This is an
area that requires greater integration and streamlining between the legal and institutional
frameworks governingurban development and environmental licensing.

IdentifiedPotential SociaVEnvironmentalIssues

A brief assessment of the environmental and social impacts of the project identified a number of
areas of potential risk and weakness as regards environmental and social impacts. The proposed
project addresses these in systematic way.

Policy Area 1: HousingPolicies and Institutions

Disarticulation of Programs: There is an historic disconnect between housing programs and
urban development policies and instruments such as territorial planning, municipal zoning and
environmental programs. This can result in construction of social housing projects in inadequate
areas, such as in environmentally sensitive areas. In addition, it has been identified that there has
been an historical disconnect between programs in solid waste management, urban transport,
water supply and sanitation and housing. This can result in the development of housing that may
prevent low-income beneficiaries of government housing programs from enjoying the full
benefits of urban life, with housing often being built far from transport networks and sources of
employment, for example.        There have been advances, however, to mediate these potential
negative social and environmental impacts, several of which are supported by the DPL. These
include: creation of the Ministry of Cities, the promotion of good planning instruments as those
identified in the City Statute and technical assistance to municipalities to formulate integrated
planning actions through Planos Diretores and Municipal Housing Plans. The Technical
Assistance Loan that i s associated with the DPL envisages actions that would lead to the better
integration of the various secretariats within the Ministry of Cities, including transport, water
supply and sanitation, housing and urban development.          The national housing policy, to be
monitored through the National Housing Plan, articulates the need for such improved integration.
There is a risk that still exists, however. The Ministry of Cities i s a new ministry. Its current
structure which segregates housing, urban development, sanitation and transport into separate
secretariatsdoes not facilitate the neededintegration, and the DPL could take extra effort to better
integrate these secretariats, especially in the reformulation of the land subdivision law which has
direct impact on the urban development and housing secretariats, inparticular.

Fragmentation between Levels of Government:           Urban and housing policies are generally
fragmented between levels of government and there i s a need to bring greater harmonization
among these various levels. This i s partly a legacy of a long period in Brazil's history of not
having defined housing and urban development policies at the national level. The lack of
integration among levels of government has contributed to the low level of impact of social
housing programs in Brazil, and a likely poor allocation of scarce public resources in the sector.
The National Housing Policy addresses these issues by attempting to develop synergies between
federal, state and local policies and to develop institutions, such as National Housing Fund, that
will attempt to establish an appropriate hierarchy of policies and integration of programs.

 Weakness in Resource Mobilization: A legacy of the collapse of the Brazilian National Housing
Bank (BNH) has been an inability to mobilize resources for social housing and other programs


                                                  55

aimed at improving the living conditions of the urban poor. The government proposes to develop
a National Low-Income Housing Fund that would serve as the vehicle to mobilize public (and
potentially private) sources of funds for housing and urban development programs at the federal
level. The policy calls for a systemthat would encourage the leveraging of these funds with state
and local resources, and would establish clear rules for accessing the resources available in the
fund. The DPLwould support that process.

Policy Area 2: Housing Finance Market

The actions to be supported in the Housing Finance Market are aimed at increasing the
availability of housing finance, the effectiveness of housing finance and deepening the market for
housing finance, including providing incentives to make existing programs reach lower income
groups. The actions supported in the DPLare expectedto have positive social impacts.

Policy Area 3: Housing Subsidies

Disarticulation Between Subsidy Programs: One of the identified deficiencies in the current
subsidy environment, i s that there i s a greater need to integrate housing programs with national
income transfer and other social programs such as Bolsa Familia, Bolsa Escola and Fome Zero.
The result of this disarticulation i s continued social exclusion, as it i s implied that housing
programs are not well targeted to the poor. This i s one of the prime areas to be developed under
the DPL and the accompanying TAL. It is recommend that linlung housing programs for the
poor with national income transfer programs such as Bolsa Familia, will allow for the better
targeting of such programs and ensure that the poorest are benefiting. The program aims to
rationalize existing subsidy programs, develop better targeting mechanisms and develop
monitoring and evaluation systems for the existing government programs.

A Lack of Information:       The social assessment indicated that there is a lack of credible
information regarding living conditions to determine if housing programs and subsidies will be
targeting the geographic areas and families in greatest need. One of the impacts of this is that
resources may not be directed to geographic regions with the highest demand for public
investment, and thus continue the current trend of informal development in certain regions.
Historically, for example, more public housingresources have gone to the south and southeast, at
the expense of the northeast where housing deficits are considered highest. Developing proper
data bases will be important to properly channel public resources to regions of greatest deficits.
The development of data bases and monitoring and evaluation systems would be developed under
the accompanying TAL.

Lack of Optimization of Resources: The assessment also indicated that the National Housing
Policy, and its implementation through the National Housing Plan, will be ineffective if scarce
public resources (both financing and subsidy) are not better optimized to allow for greater
coverage of beneficiaries and to ensure that the poor are properly targeted.         Without such
optimization, housing deficits would continue and housing programs would not reach the poorest.
The assessment suggests instruments such as proper local planning would help to optimize
resources for housing programs by ensuringthat they are most effectively used at the local level.
The DPL would support such efforts, and more, by ensuring that subsidy programs are
harmonized and that monitoring and evaluation systems would ensure that the proper segments of
the market are benefiting from subsidy programs.




                                                  56

Policy Area 4: Land andDevelopment

Minimum Lot Sizes: The assessment suggests that any debate on Law 6.766/79 will need to
balance the elimination of minimum lot sizes, with the constitutional right to dignified housing
and the potential impacts of increased density that an elimination of minimum lot sizes could
induce. However, this should be viewed against the current situation in which many argue that
too onerous development standards lead to increases in land prices, a lack of developed land for
the poor and the resultant process of large-scale informal urban settlements. This i s one of many
areas of the proposed reforms to the law that will be heldto public debate, led by the Ministry of
Cities.

Compatibility between Legislation:       Environmental legislation i s considered to be further
advanced than the legislation governingland subdivision. It has also been noted that conflicts are
inherent in the licensing process of new subdivisions, particularly between state and municipal
jurisdictions, which may disagree on what is in the purview of local authorities and what i s in the
purview of state authorities. This conflict is one of the main reasons for the long time it takes to
approve new land subdivisions. This results in unauthorized subdivisions and perpetuates the
problem of informality in urban areas. Revision of 6.766/79will need to resolve these conflicts if
it is to be effective. Likewise, any revised law must resolve the conflicts between environmental
legislation and the regularization of existing informal settlements, many of which occupy
environmentally protected areas. This will require careful analysis and consensus buildingas the
law is debatedinthe public arena.
