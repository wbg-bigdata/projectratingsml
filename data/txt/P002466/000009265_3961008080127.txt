FARAHAANE IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
(CR 2063-SO)
Summary
1     This is a Project Completion Note for the Somalia Farahaane Irrigation
Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 2063-SO). The project was approved by the Board on
September 12, 1989 for SDR21.2 million (US$28.5 million equivalent) and became
effective on March 20, 1990. Due to the instability within the country and the collapse of
the Government in December 1990, all operations and disbursements in Somalia were
suspended as of March 15, 1991. On July 26, 1995 IDA canceled the undisbursed balance
in the amount of SDRI 9.7 million (US$23.3 million equivalent). This report was prepared
by Donna Criddle, Africa Agriculture & Environment Operations Division (AF2AE) and
reviewed by Sushma Ganguly, Division Chief, AF2AE and Surendra Agarwal, AF2DR. It
is based on materials in the project files and discussions with Messrs. Akthar Elahi and
James Coates, who were involved with preparing the project. Due to the absence of
Government in Somalia there is no input from the borrower. The project is not rated.
Background
2.    Somalia is dependent on irrigated agriculture for about 70 percent of all crop
production due to harsh, semi-arid climate conditions. One-third of the land under
irrigation is in the Shebelli valley, where infrastructure is a combination of ineffective
traditional irrigation systems and an outdated poorly maintained network, resulting in
water shortages and inefficiency in water management. Increasing the efficiency of poorly
managed irrigation schemes in the area of the Shebelli river and rehabilitation of
inoperative irrigation infrastructure (rather than new schemes) were identified as the most
cost effective ways of increasing agricultural output and farmers' incomes. The project
concept was identified by a joint FAO/CP/IDA mission and the Government in September
1983. The purpose was to rehabilitate the Shebelli valley's irrigation facilities. An
extensive feasibility study of the Genale project area, involving aerial survey and
topographical mapping and a soil classification survey, was financed under a Project
Preparation Facility (PPF), approved in August 1984 for US$1.0 million. This PPF was
approved for what was initially called the Genale Irrigation Rehabilitation Project located
in the lower Shebelli plain. This later developed into two smaller projects: the Farahaane
Irrigation Rehabilitation Scheme (IDA) and the Shalambood Irrigation Rehabilitation
Scheme (USAID). The Government began project preparation of the Genale area
network containing the Qoryooley and Falkeerow barrages in September 1985 with the
assistance of consultants and staff of FAO/CP. After the IDA/1FAD preappraisal mission
of November 1986, a supplemental PPF advance was approved in October 1987 for



-2-
US$500,000 to prepare detailed designs and preparation of bidding documents. All
disbursements, amounting to less than US$2.0 million, for this project were made under
the PPF before the collapse of the Government.
Project Objectives/Description
3.    The aim of the Farahaane project was to increase the production of food and cash
crops of 5,600 smallholder farms through better irrigation management, improved
infrastructure, efficient water use and adaptive research. The design was in accordance
with the Government's development and food production strategy. It included (i)
rehabilitation of the Qoryooley and Falkeerow barrages and existing canals; (ii)
rehabilitation of and/or construction of an irrigation and drainage network, with drainage
pumping stations at the Farahaane irrigation site; (iii) coral stone surfacing of roads that
connected various villages in the project area; (iv) construction of a field office,
workshop/stores and staff housing in the Farahaane area; (v) procurement of survey and
maintenance equipment, plant protection equipment and vehicles; (vi) provision of land
surveys and registration of land titles; (vii) supply of drugs and chemicals for malaria and a
schistosomiasis control program in selective project areas; (viii) provision of safe drinking
water and development of various women's activities related to home improvement and
income generation; (ix) provision of a drainage master plan and studies related to water
management, users and associations, water user charges and operation and monitoring
activities.
Project Implementation
4.    Although there were only two conditions for effectiveness--appointment of a
project manager and opening of the project account--due to country instability, the project
did not become effective until March 20, 1990, six months after signing the credit.
Terrorist activities and insecurity accelerated shortly after project effectiveness and the
collapse of the Government in December 1990, precluded further implementation
activities. Only two supervision mnissions could be completed before the project was
interrupted by the continuing civil strife. The only disbursements made were for
procurement financed under the PPF and for establishing the special account in June 1990.
5.    The first supervision mission of November 1989 discussed start-up activities with
the new project management unit, including reviewing the steps needed to make the credit
effective and a review of the progress on tender documents for the International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) of civil works for irrigation and drainage works and Local
Competitive Bidding (LCB) for buildings and roads. The contract for consultants to
supervise overall construction of the project had been evaluated and was under
negotiation. LCB procedures for construction of headquarters buildings and office
fumniture were well advanced. Recommendation for award of the civil works tender,
which was the largest single construction contract and the backbone of the project, was
reviewed by the Bank in November 1990, but the contract could not be awarded due to
the deterioration of security.



-3-
6.    A follow-up mission visited the area in November-December 1990 as part of the
Somali Country Implementation Review The Bank had been reviewing the deteriorating
security situation for several months to decide on the advisability of undertaking major
civil works while general breakdown of law and order progressed toward Jowhar in
Middle Shebelli. The mission recommended that the bid validity period be extended to
February 1991 on the major civil works contract in order to reassess whether the security
situation would improve sufficiently to award the contract and begin construction. The
United States Agency for International Development (USAID) terminated funding of their
neighboring Shebelli Water Management Project (SWMP) in Shalambood in late 1989
which was a parallel initiative with important implications on land tenure (through their
work already achieved in land titling), storage facilities and water legislation. In order to
fill the gap, USAID arranged for short-term consultancy assignments to address water
charges and land tenure issues, as no other funding was available. However, armed
conflict never subsided and all procurement efforts were allowed to lapse.
Conclusions and Lessons Learned
7.    This project differs from others, in that the preparation activities included a review
of the irrigation subsector, which would normally have been carried out under separate
sector work or preinvestment studies. The thoroughness of identifying the most
advantageous site and planning the various inter-related elements for each component
were the forerunner of the methods now encouraged by the Bank to achieve quality at
entry of projects into the portfolio. Also, the focus and conditionality on management of
the whole river basin, rather than just the project, is a precursor to the current emphasis on
basin-based intervention in water management, including irrigation.
8.    Several possible irrigation rehabilitation projects were under consideration by the
Bank in the Juba and Shebelli valleys at that time, which finally developed into the
Farahaane Scheme as other donors supported other projects. All Bank staff inputs are,
however, attributed to this project. Thus, the elapsed time from identification of what had
first been referred to as the Genale Rehabilitation Project (Farahaane and Shalambood
subprojects) in September 1983 to appraisal in September 1988 (and Board in September
1989) appear unusually long and staff intensive. Some slippages, however, directly related
to this project were due to (1) complex components across several sectors, (2)
coordination of various donors in the Shebelli Basin, (3) slow follow-up on decisions to be
made by the Government and Bank, (4) misunderstandings and incomplete work on the
part of the subcontractors hired by the consulting firm carrying out the basic feasibility
study, upon which appraisal depended, (4) the need for further aerial photos, (5) the need
for a water balance study to settle the Riparian issue with Ethiopia where the Shebelli
River originated, and (6) difficulty in hiring a River Basin Engineering Advisor prior to
appraisal.
9.    The issue of Riparian rights was first recognized as early as January 1983 when
Ethiopia was constructing a major reservoir and power plant (Melka Wakana)on the
Shebelli River with Soviet assistance. There is no international agreement on water rights
between Somalia and Ethiopia on the use of the Shebelli River. The aim of the Bank's



-4-
proposed project was to increase water use efficiency through rehabilitation which would
not require additional abstraction of water from the Shebelli River. At an early stage in
the project preparation process the Bank's view was that there was no requirement to
inform Ethiopia's officials nor seek their consent for construction of this project because it
was a rehabilitation project and it was unlikely that Ethiopia would use the water from the
Shebelli to the detriment of the project within its economic life. The status showed that
the Melka Wakana hydro-project constructed in Ethiopia on the upper banks of the
Shebelli River would not reduce water availability and would serve to even the flow. In
January 1987 it was again determined that, based on Bank guidelines in force at the time,
no notification to Ethiopia by Somalia was needed because the Farahaane Rehabilitation
Project, being a rehabilitation project, would not alter the quality or quantity of water
flows nor would it be adversely affected by water uses of the other riparian, Ethiopia.
10.   Unusually strong efforts were made by IDA to coordinate preparation activities
with other ongoing initiatives in the area, namely (i) IDA's interest in Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KFW) involvement with the Jowhar Sugar Rehabilitation project and off-
stream reservoir at Duduble and coordination with their irrigation study to avoid
duplication of work; (ii) African Development Bank's (AfDB's) and USAID's projects,
(iii) follow up on aerial mapping already completed for potential use in this project, and
(iv) an effort to possibly combine photography with the Shebelli and North West
Agriculture schemes. However, the need to collaborate with other projects in the area
was pursued and the issue of Riparian rights, that continued to resurface at various
intervals, may have caused a slow down in maintaining project momentum.
11.   As a lesson learned from the Bay Region Extension and Central Rangelands
project where cofinancing was not obtained until after appraisal, cofinancing efforts were
explored during the identification mission of September 1983 so that all donors could be
involved in project design and preparation. The mission explored USAID funding and
possible interest by EEC, the Italian Government and at the Consultative Group meeting.
However, instability and civil strife prevented any further interest by donors.
12.   A better grasp of procurement requirements by the Government could have
prevented misunderstanding and overcome the slowness in completing the tendering
process. For instance, the Government's evaluation on awarding the contract for
consultants to carry out the Feasibility Study of 1984, financed under the PPF was faulty
in that both the technical and financial proposals were opened at the same time and award
decision was based on highly subjective criteria rather than an adequate weighting system.
Non-compliance with bid opening procedures ultimately led to retendering. The entire
tendering process took 1 year and 4 months. Due to the implementing agency's
unfamiliarity with evaluation procedures for prequalifications of contractors and joint
ventures for the major civil works contract, interested bidders were notified of award
before review and clearance from the Bank.
13.   The project was innovative in attempting to rehabilitate, rather than completely
restructure, an irrigated area. It was focusing on Government's efforts on smallholder
food-crop development, while prior irrigation development had been in the hands of large-



-5-
scale banana growers. It sought to improve management of the river basin in a
participatory approach so that water could be apportioned to all users. These lessons will
have to be learned again by the successor Somali Government.
