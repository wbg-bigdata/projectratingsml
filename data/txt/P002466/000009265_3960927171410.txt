HENORANDUK AND RECOMhEUDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPKENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EECUTIV  DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
70 THE SOMKLI DhDMCRATIC RIPUIIC
FOR THE PFARARANE IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Somali Democratic Republic for SDR 21.2 million (US$28.5 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard
IDA terms with 40 years maturity and help finance an agricultural development
project in the Lower Shebelli Region.
2.       Background-  Agriculture, including livestock, crops, forestry and
fisheries occupies a dominant position in the Somali economy, accounting for 62Z
of GDP, over 95Z of export earnings and more than 80S of employment. The
irrigated agriculture sub-sector (flood and controlled irrigation), which
accounts for some 200,000 ha, about 202 of the country's cultivated area,
produces the bulk of marketed foodstuffs, the entire sugar output and all the
bananas. The Government's agricultural plans include irrigation and the
rehabilitation of existing infrastructure to increase crop production.
3.       Only the two major rivers, the Shebelli and the Juba, have a
significant potential for irrigation. There are a variety of irrigation schemes
serving about 60,000 ha area along the Shebelli river. Production ranges from
sugar, bananas, vegetables and rice to maize and sesame. Virtually all
irrigation structures on the Shebelli Valley are in need of rehabilitation due
to lack of maintenance caused by insufficient budgets and neglect for many
years. The Genale-Bulo Marerta complex, capable of irrigating 30,000 ha of
comparatively fertile level plain, has maximum production potential. The
proposed project is situated in this area.
4.       Rationale for IDA involvement:  The objective of IDA strategy is to
assist the Government of Somalia (GOS) achieve faster sustainable growth with
equity. The major constraints to achieving this have been inappropriate
policies, weak institutions, undeveloped or dilapidated infrastructure and
unskilled human resources. The Agricultural Sector Adjustment Programs I and 1I
(Cr. 1711-SO and 2030-SO) address the policy constraints in the economy,
particularly the agriculture sector, and set the policy environment for
investment projects on the subsectors. In the irrigated agriculture subsector,
IDA involvement is necessary to find a long-term and sustainable solution to
issues of: efficiency of water use by small farmers; water charges and financing
of operation and maintenance costs of irrigation schemes; and extension and
support services for irrigated agriculture. The institutional strengthening of
MOA is essential to address these points and to support future irrigation
development in the Juba Valley (Baardhere Dam Project).
5.       Project Objectives:  The main objective o' the project is to increase
production of food and cash crops on about 5,60.   all private farms through
improvement of the irrigation system and water use efficiency in combination
with adaptive research, extension and inputs supply. Another objective is to
establish effective irrigation management and introduce water charges as a cost
recovery mechanism to ensure the sustainability of the rehabilitation program.
These objectives are fully consistent with GOS and Bank strategy.

O.       Proicet Descriptions  The proposed project would includes (t)
rehabilitation of exLsting Qoryooley and Palkeerow barrfages; () rehabilitation
and/or construction of an irrigation and drainag network Including a new
drainago ptmping station to sem   about 3,100 ha In the Farahaane lrrigation
scheme# (iii) coral rock surfacing of roads for about 20 km connecting various
project villages; (Iv) construction of a fLild office workshop/stores, staff
housing for the Parahasne scheme; (v) procurm_nt of maintonance and survey
equipment, plant protection equipment and vehicleel (vi) provision of
agricultural inputs and land levelling for about 500 has (vii) provision for
cadastral surveys and issue of land titles; (viii) provision of drugs and
chemicals for a malaria and schistosomiasis control program covering 14 villages
in the project area, and laboratory and other equipment for an annual screening
survey and treatment campaigpn (it) provision of a drinking water supply system
for a village and various women development activities in three villages of the
Farahaane scheme: (z) engineering services for construction supervision and
development of a drainage master plan for the lower Shebelli area, and
specialized services and studies related to water management, monitoring of
drainage effectiveness, organization of water users associations and their
future role in O&M activities, and assessment of water chargesl (xi) retroactive
financing of revisions of Tender Documents (up to US$75,000); and (zii)
provision to cover incremental operating costs and training of MOA and MON staff
associated with project activities. The project would be implemented over a
period of six years by the Irrigation and Land Use Department of the Ministry of
Agriculture and the Department of Malaria and Schistosomiasis Control of the
Hinistry of Health. The total cost of the project is esatimated at US$32.1
million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$28.5 million (89Z).
A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Aounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations In Somalia are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively; A map and the Staff Appraisal Report No.7489-SO, dated June 30,
1989 are also attached.
7.       Agreed Actions: The following key assurances were obtained during
negotiations: ti) MOA would complete registration of the entire Parahaane scheme
area and issue titles by March 31, 1992; (ii) MOA would establish Jowhar
reservoir operation rules and agree with the Bank for release of supplies during
the months of December and January by June 30, 1991 which would be enforced by
June 30, 1992; (iii) MOA would establish an intervillage committee for the
Gayweerow primary canal by June 30, 1990 to coordinate the distribution of water
and undertake a study by June 30, 1993 to assess village committees' capacity to
assum management of primary and secondary canals of the Parahaane scheme and
implement the agreed recommendations by March 31, 1994; (iv) recommendations of
studies related to water law, land law and water charges assessment undertaken
by MOA under the USAID Shebelli Water Management Project would be subject to IDA
review and comments before implementation; and (v) GOS would contain future
expansion of irrigation areas upstream of the Genale barrage to less than 1,500
ha and restrict perennial crops under banana and sugar cultivation to 4,500 ha
and 2,000 ha, respectively.
8.       The following are conditions of credit effectivenesst (a) opening of a
Project Account with an initial deposit of So Shillings 50 million to meet
initial requirements for local counterpart funds; and (b) appointment of a
qualified and experienced project manager acceptable to IDA to direct day to day
field activities of the project.

9.       Benefitss The benefits of the project would be obtained from increased
yields and higher cropping intensities, possible with a more efficient, reliable
irrigation system and improved water management in the Shebelli river basin, on
the scheme and at the farm level. This will permit (a) increased crop
production; and (b) increased incomes and more stable and reliable livelihood
for some 5,600 subsistence farmers. Malaria and schistosomiasis disease control
will improve health standards and the quality of life in the project area.
10.      Riskss The main risk is that expectations for improved management of
the Shebelli basin may not be met. Improvements in river basin management would
include the limitation of unregulated pumping in the Upper and Middle Shebelli,
and the operation of the Jowbar reservoir to provide adequate water for
downstream users in the initial stages of the dry season (December and January)
when the sesame crop is growing. The Government is taking many steps to
strengthen its control of the Shebelli Water resources, and with the support
provided by IDA and USAID it is expected to be able to greatly improve the
efficiency and equity of water allocations.
11.      A second important category of risk is the performance of key
agricultural support services, both public and private. These services become
increasingly important as the level of productivity and input use increases.
Bottlenecks in the development of research recommendations, in the importation
and distribution of fertilizers, and in production and distribution of improved
seed have limited productivity improvements in the Shebelli valley for many
years. A series of donor supported projects in recent years is addressing these
problems. This, combined with the Government's efforts to liberalize product
and input markets, provide foreign exchange to the productive sectors and
rationalize and increase the efficiency of agricultural support services, should
permit these bottlenecks to be overcome.
12.      A third category of risk is that projected yields depend on the
availability of water in specified quantities as well as timely availability of
agricultural inputs. Steps taken to regulate the flow of Jowhar reservoir
during the months of December and January and restrictions imposed on further
development of perennial crop areas with licensing of pumps would ensure the
availability of water. Provisions made under the project for supply of required
agricultural inputs would also ensure their timely availability.
13.      A further risk to the longer term sustainability of the project is that
the water users associations and other institutional arrangements for water
charges may nAt work out. To reduce this risk, special care has been taken to
involve these associations in the planning and design of the project.
14.      Recommendation:  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
