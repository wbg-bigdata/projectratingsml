REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILLIPINES FOR THE
MAGAT RIVER MULTIPURPOSE PROJECT - STAGE I
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
for an equivalent of US$42 million to the Republic of the Philippines to help
finance the first stage of a multipurpose project in the Cagayan Valley of
Northern Luzon. The loan would have a term of 25 years with seven years of
grace with interest at 8.5 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent Economic Report - "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of the Philippines" (No. 568-PH of November 7, 1974) was circu-
lated to the Executive Directors on November 11, 1974. A basic economic
mission was in the Philippines in April/May and is currently preparing its
report. Annex I contains country data.
Recent Developments
3.        In the past two years there has been a sharp increase in the level
of economic activity in the Philippines. The growth in real GNP, which had
been about 5-6% a year for more than a decade, doubled to 10% in 1973. The
strong recovery in 1973 was led by the international commodity boom and
resultant increased export incomes in the Philippines, by a strong recovery
in agricultural and industrial production for the domestic market, and by
an expansion in public and private investment. The increased domestic out-
put, and a 28% improvement in the external terms of trade, resulted in a
14% increase in gross national income in real terms in 1973 compared with
about 1% in 1972. Underemployment and unemployment remain quite high, how-
ever, and in common with most other countries, the rate of inflation in-
creased appreciably since 1973. The Government has pressed ahead with a
number of important and potentially far-reaching economic and social reforms
in such areas as agrarian reform, taxation, customs administration and
tariffs, banking and government organization.
4.        The agricultural sector, which has suffered from adverse weather
conditions during the previous three years, grew by 7% in 1973. Rice pro-
duction in crop year 1973-74 increased by 23% over the level of the previous
year when floods reduced production. This increase was mainly due to fa-
vorable weather conditions, increased use of fertilizers, more supervised
credit and increased investments in supporting rural services as part of a
general drive for rice self-sufficiency. The impact of typhoons and flooding
in December 1974 appears to have been significant and as a result no in-
crease in rice production is likely for the crop year 1974/75.
5.        The boom in export incomes and increased activity in agriculture
has provided the base for renewed expansion of the industrial sector which



-2-
grew by about 11% in 1973. Non-traditional industrial exports, which have
been increasing since 1970, are estimated to have doubled in 1973 to about
$200 million. The growth of industrial production for export was also
stimulated by the Government's industrial export drive which includes a
range of export incentives. More recently, however, industrial output and
exports have been affected by the recent dampening of domestic demand and
a slowdown in the economies of k4ey trading partners, and industrial export
earnings grew more slowly in 1974.
6.        The growth in production was also assisted by increased public
development outlays in 1973 made possible by a significant improvement in
the financial position of the Government. The ratio of public investment
to GNP is expected to reach about 3% in FY75 as compared with 1 .8% in FY72.
The Government has implemented a series of long needed tax reforms and
improvements in tax administration, such as customs and tariff reform, tax
amnesties, reforms in corporate and local taxation, continuation of the
export tax, and increased taxation on luxury items and on gasoline. These
reforms, aided by the increased economic activity, the boom in export incomes,
and domestic inflation, resulted in a 30% increase in tax revenues in FY73,
and an estimated 50% in FY74. As a result, the ratio of national and local
Government tax revenues to GNP has increased from an average of 9-10% in
recent years to an estimated 13% in FY74.
7.        High prices for the Philippines chief exports, including coconut
products, sugar, copper and wood products, were largely responsible for an
increase in merchandise receipts of almost 70% in 1973. The merchandise
trade account recorded a surplus of about $270 million, as compared with a
$150 million deficit in the previous year. International reserves rose by
about $600 million during the year and stood at $876 million, equivalent to
about five months of imports, at the end of December 1973. However, since
mid-1974, a large trade deficit appeared, largely because the growth in
export prices had moderated while import prices had continued to rise rapidly.
As a result of this trade deficit, the overall balance of payments surplus
fell from about $700 million in 1973 to less than $100 million in 1974. By
the end of 1974 international reserves were about $1.2 billion, equivalent to
roughly four months imports. Net reserves were about $900 million.
8.        In the latter part of 1973, inflation emerged as a major problem
in the Philippines. Starting in mid-1973 consumer prices began to rise at
an annual rate of more than 40%. This was caused by the large increase in
liquidity since the export boom began in 1973, and by a number of factors,
including the higher rate of world inflation, domestic food shortages and
the increased cost of petroleum. Aided by monetary and fiscal policies
aimed at absorbing the excessive liquidity expansion, the rate of inflation
slowed to less than 20% by the end of 1974. Other factors that helped
moderate the rate of inflation include the substantial reduction in the
balance of payments surplus in 1974 and the considerable increase in rice
production in crop year t973/74. Indications are that the rate of domestic
inflation has significantly subsided in 1975. However, the recent inflation
has exacerbated the decline in real wages which fell by a total of about 25%



-3-
between 1969 and 1973. The urban wage earners have been most affected while
agricultural and entrepreneurial incomes appear to have improved very substan-
tially. Money wages will have to be raised in the near future if further
deterioration in the living standards of urban wage earners is to be avoided.
Growth Prospects
9.        The abrupt deterioration in the external terms of trade since
the middle of 1974, and the recession in the economies of key trading
partners, together with uncertainty about how quickly they will recover,
now threatens some of the Philippines' recent economic gains even though
the Government remains committed to maintaining the growth momentum which
began in 1973 to provide for a continued increase in incomes and employment.
The high priority accorded to expanding employment opportunities - in the
short-term as well as the long-term - stems from the fact that unemployment
and underemployment are still high and the labor force continues to grow at
3% a year.
10.       Priority is also being given to expanding food production for the
domestic market, to expanding export production and to accelerating develop-
ment of local energy resources. The difficulties experienced during the
last two years in importing sufficient quantities of food at reasonable
prices, especially cereals, have increased the Government's resolve to
achieve food self-sufficiency as soon as possible. The Government rightly
recognizes that the increased cost of petroleum and other imports cannot be
financed indefinitely by borrowing abroad and it is actively encouraging
both local and foreign investors to expand the productive capacity of ex-
port industries and to undertake major new import-replacing investments.
Because it will take time for these investments to have an impact on the
balance of payments, the Government is seeking increased support from the
international financial community to help carry out its development program
and to ease the adjustment to higher petroleum and other import prices. Be-
cause of the substantial improvement in the external debt burden and inter-
national reserve position in the last two years the Philippines now has
the capacity to borrow externally larger amounts of capital in support of
its development program, if capital is made available.
11.       Maintaining a GNP growth rate of about 7% a year in real terms
during the next few years will have to depend heavily on the expansion of
output for the domestic market rather than on growing export markets. The
prospects are for continued expansion in agriculture with a 4-5% increase in
production in the year ahead. With a few exceptions, industries are operating
at relatively high levels of capacity utilization. Increased investments will
be needed in a wide range of consumer and intermediate goods industries. A
number of big projects are proposed in metals, fertilizer, steel and ship-
building which are likely to push up the private investment rate from recent
levels of about 16% of GNP to perhaps 22% by the latter part of the decade.
The public infrastructure program that was approved in 1973, which called for
outlays of about P 1-2 billion at current prices in FY74-77, has become out-
dated because of the subsequent rapid inflation and changes in investment



-4-
priorities as a result of the energy crisis. A new program has not been
finalized, but the Government is putting more emphasis on developing nuclear
and indigenous power resources and on irrigation, feeder roads and other
projects to support increased food and export production. The Government has
made considerable progress in recent years in building up its capacity to
prepare and execute projects. However, there will be a need for continued
efforts to strengthen this aspect of administration. The ratio of public
investment to GNP is projected to rise from the present level of 3% to about
4% by 1977.
Balance of Payments
12.       Merchandise export receipts are estimated to decrease somewhat in
1975 but rebound again by about 30% in 1976 mainly due to an increase in
volume. Import payments are projected to increase by a total of over 35% in
the same period, including a 14% increase in prices. A cumulative decline
in the external terms of trade of about 27% during this period would probably
wipe out the gains made in the recent export price boom and return the terms
of trade to the level preva:Lling in 1972. However, the outcome for the
balance of payments is quite sensitive to assumptions about external prices
and without the projected deterioration in the terms of trade, for example,
the projected trade deficit of $1.2 bil-lion in 1976 would be reduced by
about $1 billion.
13.       If the projected deterioration in the terms of trade takes place,
the total foreign exchange requirements for meeting the current account
deficit and amortizing loans during 1975 and 1976 would be about $2.3 billion.
About $700 million would be provided by direct investment and short-term
trade finance and about $700 million would come from suppliers' credits and
commercial commodity financing. Disbursements of project finance to the
public sector, from the present pipeline, would amount to about $300 million.
The balance of the remaining capital inflow that may be required of about
$200 million in 1975 and $400 million in 1976, could be financed by the
Central Bank through short-term borrowing. This would, however, result in
a substantial decline in net reserves by 1976. In these circumstances, it
would be preferable to finance these deficits with additional medium and
long-term loans so that the Government could maintain its growth strategy
while avoiding serious deterioration in its reserve position.
14.       Recent important gains in reducing the external debt burden and in
improving the external reserve position would be jeopardised if the banking
system had recourse to short and medium-term borrowing abroad in excess of
the $600 million mentioned above. Fortunately, some assistance may be forth-
coming from the IMF. In addition, foreign donors hopefully will extend quick-
disbursing commodity loans with long maturities, which would make an important
contribution to maintaining growth and a manageable balance of payments posi-
tion in 1975. There is considerable scope for additional medium and long-
term loans from foreign donors to finance the much larger capital goods imports
projected for 1976. The Philippine Consultative Group reviewed the foreign
exchange position at its meeting in December 1974 and accepted the need for



-5-
some official commodity aid in addition to rising levels of commitments for
development projects to support the Philippines' increased development pro-
gram. If the projected capital inflows are forthcoming with an appropriate
combination of medium and long-term maturities management of the external
debt would not present serious problems. Medium and long-term debt out-
standing would rise from $2 billion this year to about $3 billion by 1976
but the ratio of debt service payments to exports would fall from 15% this
year to about 13% in 1976. The Philippines would still be in a position to
contract substantial amounts of external debt during the final years of the
decade and this would lead to an increase in the debt service ratio to about
16-17% by 1980. The Philippines is already creditworthy for substantial
Bank lending. At present, the Bank/IDA share in total debt outstanding is
about 9% and its share in debt service is about 5%. Even with a substantially
higher level of Bank lending, these shares would not be expected to increase
significantly in the years ahead.
15.       During the last three years, the Government has significantly im-
proved its fiscal performance with taxes increasing by more than an average
of 40% each year. Nevertheless, the Government's ambitious development
program, which would increase public investment from the current level of
3% of GNP to about 5% by the end of the decade, will continue to require
resources in excess of the foreign capital which will become available for
financing the import component of development projects. Thus some financing
of local currency expenditures will be justified, especially for projects of
economic and social importance which need only limited amounts of foreign
exchange.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES
16.       The Philippines has received 30 Bank loans and three IDA credits
totalling $680.2 million, net of cancellations. About 48% of the Bank/
IDA lending, about $306 million, has been for infrastructure projects in
power, transportation, water supply and for education whilst $25 million
has been for population. The remainder has been divided about equally be-
tween agriculture and industry. About $168 million of this has been for
irrigation, livestock, rice processing, rural credit and rural development
and about $175 million for industry in four loans for the Private Develop-
ment Corporation of the Philippines, one loan for the Development Bank of
the Philippines and one for small and medium industries. There has been a
marked improvement in the way Bank financed projects in the Philippines have
been executed in the last three years compared with experience in the 1960s
when shortages of peso counterpart funds combined with poor administration
to cause serious problems. All these projects are now going reasonably
well. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and
IFC investments as of May 31, 1975 and notes on the execution of on-going
projects.



-6-
17.       The Bank's lending program has been designed to continue to sup-
port the increased Philippine development effort with its particular
emphasis on agriculture and infrastructure. Shortages of domestic revenues
led to low investment for these purposes in the past. The last three years
have seen major changes which have helped to overcome these constraints and
both the ambitious Philippine development program and the Bank's lending
program have been designed to make good past neglect and to meet future needs.
Commitments in FY74 amounted to $165.1 million, and in FY75 $208 million
compared to an average of about $30 million a year in the preceeding five
years.
18.       Seven loans in the Philippines totalling $208 million - Population,
Sixth Power, Inter-Island Shipping, Fourth Private Development Corporation,
Tarlac Irrigation, Rural Development and Small and Medium Industries Devel-
opment have been approved by the Executive Directors in FY75. In addition
to the proposed project, other projects which may be ready for Board con-
sideration in FY76 include livestock, fisheries, grain storage, education,
industrial investment, urban development and rural development.
19.       IFC has made commitments in the Philippines totalling $76.1 million
for investments in thirteen companies in the fields of development banking,
power, telecommunications, ceramic tiles, paper, petroleum products, nickel
mining and refining, chemicals and synthetic fibers. Of these investments,
as of May 31, 1975, $18.1 million have been sold, $0.4 million cancelled
and $2.9 million repaid, leaving a net portfolio of $54.7 million. On the
same date $7.0 million was undisbursed. Preliminary proposals have been
received for an aluminum smelter and other projects in the pulp and paper,
dinnerware, metal alloys and shipbuilding fields.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR-1/
20.       Agriculture is the predominant sector in the Philippine economy
generating approximately one-third of the gross national product, accounting
for one-half of total employment and about three quarters of export earnings.
Over 70% of the total land under cultivation is taken up by cereals, of which
rice and corn are the most important. The remaining land is primarily taken
up by the major export crops: sugar, coconuts, abaca, pineapples and tobacco.
21.       During the first half of the last decade, agricultural production
increased by only 2.4% a year. However, with a breakthrough in rice pro-
duction following the increased use of high-yielding varieties, fertilizers
and irrigation in the sixties, the rates of growth for rice and corn pro-
duction were at about 5% and 8%, respectively, by the latter part of the
1/   A detailed Report entitled "Agricultural Sector Survey - Philippines"
(No. 39a-PH of May 2, 1973) was circulated to the Executive Directors
on May 21, 1973 (R73-111).



- 7-
decade. The sector suffered from adverse weather conditions including
severe typhoons during 1971 and 1972. These disasters slowed progress
towards self-sufficiency in food crops and annual imports of about 300,000
tons of rice were needed in 1972 and 1973. For crop year 1973-74 due to good
weather, increased use of fertilizers, more supervised credit and increased
investments in supporting rural services, the harvest reached a record 3.7
million tons of milled rice equivalent. The more recent typhoons, however,
again caused significant damage to the rice crop and production for 1974-75
is expected to be slightly lower than 1973-74.
22.       The performance of the rural-agricultural sector will be crucial
in determining whether the Philippines can increase incomes both rapidly
and equitably. At present, the domestic market for industrial products
is limited by relatively low rural incomes. Problems of poverty and
income distribution are particularly acute in the rural areas. Of the 15
million people in the bottom 40% of the income scale, 12 million live in
rural areas. The Government is aware of these problems and is dealing with
them by undertaking agrarian reform, by increasing institutional support
to agriculture to raise the productivity of small farmers, and by laying the
base for future diversification.
23.       A major Government objective is achieving self-sufficiency in
cereals, particularly rice and corn. For rice, moving towards self-
sufficiency will depend largely on increasing yields through expansion and
rehabilitation of the area under irrigation, increased use of fertilizers
and agro-chemicals and provision of adequate credit and other supporting
services. High yielding varieties, which were largely responsible for
the increase in production since the late 1960s require a much higher degree
of water control than is possible under rainfed conditions or with the
typical unimproved irrigation systems in the Philippines. At present, only
about 900,000 ha or less than 30% of all land under rice is irrigated. A
program to upgrade and expand irrigation in rice lands involving 50,000 ha
a year for the remainder of the decade would be needed to meet domestic rice
demand. Investment in irrigation is therefore of high priority.
24.       Nearly half of expected Bank lending for Philippine agriculture in
the next five years is likely to be for irrigation. The proposed project
would be the fourth Bank-assisted project aimed at improving irrigated rice
cropping on the island of Luzon. The first three projects, all in Central
Luzon, set the example for the type of rehabilitation, new construction and
operation needed for large scale rice production in the Philippines. The
proposed project would follow the same approach to improving and expanding
national irrigation systems in the Cagayan Valley of Northern Luzon. The
Valley exports rice to other regions of the Philippines and has large land
and water resources which could be developed to increase rice production.
It is also one of the poorest regions in the country. The National Irriga-
tion Systems Improvement Study recently financed under the Tarlac Irrigation
Systems Improvement Project (Loan No. 1080-PH) will help identify and pre-
pare similar projects in other regions for future Bank lending.



-8-
25.       After many years of little progress, the Government is giving
high priority to agrarian reform. The present program covers only rice
and corn tenant farmers, who nnumber about one million, and includes the
transfer of titles from landlords to tenants, an expanded program of rural
credit and increased investments in supporting rural services. In the first
two years of the new program the Government concentrated its efforts on the
larger tenanted estates of over 24 ha. It has recently broadened its focus
to include smaller landlord holdings down to 7 ha. Nevertheless, land re-
form remains a difficult and slow moving program. Perhaps the most critical
difficulty is landlord resistance to land valuation, associated with their
view that the present compensation package is unacceptable. The Government
is seeking ways to improve its approach to landlord compensation without a
sudden shift in basic policy. In November 1974 the Government commenced a
number of steps to keep the program moving. It decided to proceed with
transfers on holdings in the 7-24 ha range and accelerated the process of
identifying landlords and tenants on such holdings; it provided stiffer
penalties for violators of the Agrarian Reform Code, and it is adopting
streamlined procedures for land valuation. The critical issue remains firm
enforcement of existing laws and decrees. However, progress is still slow
and, as of June 2 of this year, the Government had issued Certificates of
Land Transfer covering 199,000 tenants farming a total of 347,000 ha in 64
provinces. This is out of a total of 424,000 tenants on holdings over 7 ha
covering altogether 825,000 ha.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
26.       The proposed Magat River Multipurpose Project consists of a portion
of Stage I of the rehabilitation and upgrading of two national and several
small communal irrigation systems now serving a total of 52,000 ha and the
expansion of these systems to serve an additional 23,000 ha and permit a
cropping intensity of 140% on the total 75,000 ha area. The Asian Develop-
ment Bank is assisting the rehabilitation of systems serving 40,000 ha of
Stage-I under the Angat-Magat Integrated Agricultural Development Project
(AMIADP) with only 10% of the financing being used for constructing new
facilities. The ADB made a loan of $9.6 million for this project in June
1973., The part of Stage I proposed for Bank assistance includes the re-
habilitation of facilities serving 12,000 ha (35%) and construction of new
facilities on 23,000 ha (65%). The AMIADP portion is designated Stage IA
and the Bank-assisted portion, Stage IB. For operation and maintenance after
construction, the entire Stage I area of 75,000 ha would be treated as a
single unit. Stage II of the Project envisages the construction on the Magat
river of a storage dam and power plant with an installed capacity of 300 MW,
the development of irrigation facilities on an additional 29,000 ha and an
increase in cropping intensity to 200% on the total project area of 104,000 ha.



-9-
27.       The project was prepared by the National Irrigation Administration
(NIA) with assistance from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. A Bank mission
appraised the Stage I project in November/December 1974 and negotiations
were held in May 1975. The leader of the Government negotiating team was
Ambassador Eduardo Z. Romualdez. The Appraisal Report (No. 727a-PH) on the
proposed project is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
Annex III provides a loan and project summary.
The Project Area
28.       The project is located in Isabela province in the Cagayan Valley
of Northern Luzon, which accounts for about 11% of the nation's rice area
and 13% of total production (see Map). About 30% of the province's rice
production is exported to Manila and Southern Luzon. The area is well
served by banking, processing and storage facilities. It is connected by
national highway to Central Luzon and Manila in the south and to the port
of Aparri on the Babuyan Channel to the north.
Agrarian Reform in the Projlect Area
29.       The Department of Agrarian Reform has identified all tenants and
holdings in Isabela province down to 7 ha. There are about 14,000 tenant
farmers operating 40,000 ha in the total project area of 75,000 ha. The
transfer of about 20,000 ha of landlord holdings larger than 7 ha will
benefit some 7,000 tenants. In addition, there are at present about 10,000
owner-operators cultivating 35,000 ha. Thus, when the land transfer is
complete some 17,000 owner-operators or 70% of the farmers in the project
area will cultivate 55,000 ha or 75% of the land. The remaining 7,000
tenant farmers on holdings under 7 ha would no longer be sharecroppers but
would have written lease agreements providing for payment of fixed rents.
Description of the Prolect
30.       The proposed project would upgrade to standards adopted in the
Tarlac Irrigation Systems Improvement Project (Loan 1080-PH) 890 ha of
the Magat River Irrigation System (MARIS), 10,000 ha of the Siffu River
Irrigation System (SIFRIS) and 1,300 ha of small communal irrigation systems
in the MARIS service area, and would extend the MARIS and SIFRIS to include
an additional 22,810 ha of currently rainfed rice land. The main components
of the project are:
(a) Modification of the existing MARIS diversion dam;
(b) Rehabilitation of two existing NIA irrigation and
drainage systems and several local communal systems
serving a total area of about 12,190 ha;
(c) Extension of the NIA systems to serve an additional
area of about 22,810 ha;



- 10 -
(d) Upgrading or construction of about 830 km of project
roads;
(e) Construction of an air strip, access roads and a bridge
across the Magat river near the MARIS diversion dam; and
(f) Procurement of vehicles and equipment.
The project would also provide for detailed engineering studies and economic
evaluation of the proposed Magat dam and reservoir, a water management
training program and technical assistance to NIA in systems operation and
construction management.
31.       Stage II of the project, construction of which is not to be
financed under the loan here recommended, calls for the construction on the
Magat river of a storage dam and power station upstream of the MARIS diver-
sion works. While preliminary field work has indicated satisfactory founda-
tion conditions at the proposed site, additional investigations of the dam
and reservoir geology are needed. Engineering studies are also required
to develop more detailed design and cost data upon which to base a final
economic evaluation. Consultants would be engaged under the project to
assist NIA with the studies, which would be divided into two phases. The
first phase would include additional geological and hydrological investi-
gations, a review of reservoir sizing, updating of designs and cost estimates
and a full economic evaluation of the proposed Stage II. The second phase
of the studies, which would depend on the outcome of the first phase, would
consist of the preparation of final designs and tender documents for con-
struction of the dam and appurtenant structures. The results of the evalua-
tion phase, which are expected to be available in January 1977, would be
subject to Bank review and the second phase would be implemented only if the
Bank is satisfied that the evaluation justifies proceeding with the final
designs for Stage II. If proceeding with final design is not justified,
the Bank may cancel up to $2 million allocated at present for this purpose.
(Schedule I paragraph 3(a) and (b) to the draft Loan Agreement).
Project Execution
32.       The project would be implemented by the National Irrigation Ad-
ministration (NIA) over a five year period. NIA was formed in 1964 to de-
velop, operate and maintain all national irrigation systems in the Philippines.
NIA is a well managed institution which is successfully executing the Upper
Pampanga River Irrigation Project, the Aurora-Penaranda Irrigation Project,
the Tarlac Irrigation Systems Improvement Project and the irrigation com-
ponent of the Rural Development Project (financed by Loan 637-PH, Loan 984-
PH/Credit 472-PH, Loan 1080-PH and Loan 1102-PH, respectively). To meet
the requirements of the Government's accelerated irrigation development poli-
cy, NIA is being reorganized. One of the first results of the reorganiza-
tion has been the creation of a Special Projects Office headed by an Assistant
Administrator to manage the major externally-assisted projects. This Office
would be responsible for carrying out the proposed project.



33.       Day-to-day responsibility for construction of Stage IA rests with
an Assistant Project Manager who reports to the AMIADP Project Manager on
all matters concerning Stage IA. The Assistant Project Manager would also
be responsible for construction of Stage IB and would report on all matters
concerning that Stage to the NIA Regional Engineer for Cagayan Valley, who
would be appointed Project Manager of the Magat River Multipurpose Project.
Both Project Managers would report to the Assistant Administrator for Special
Projects who would be in overall charge of both the AMIADP and Magat projects.
The key personnel have already been identified and are on the job. Two
construction units would be set up for Stage IB (in addition to the one
now responsible for constructing Stage IA). NIA is expected to complete
the setting up of an implementation organization satisfactory to the Bank
within the next three months, and this is a condition of effectiveness of
the loan (Section 5.01(b) of the draft Loan Agreement).
34.       For operation and maintenance the entire project area of 75,000 ha
would be administered by a single Project Manager. The whole area would be
brought to the same standards of on-farm water distribution and drainage as
the Bank-assisted irrigation projects in Central Luzon, and NIA would take
all necessary steps to ensure complete compatibility of standards and
facilities between Stages IA and IB (Section 3.07(a) of the draft Loan
Agreement). To coordinate the provision of agricultural services to farmers,
the Government would set up an Agricultural Development Coordinating Council
based on Isabela province (Section 3.08 of the draft Loan Agreement). In
addition, within six months of loan signing, NIA would set up an Agricul-
tural Development Division similar to the one operating in the Central Luzon
project areas to monitor the deployment of extension and water management
personnel, pace of land reform, cropping patterns, use of inputs and credit,
incidence of pests and diseases, and other related matters (Section 3.07(b)
of the draft Loan Agreement).
Cost Recovery
35.       NIA's record of irrigation fee collection nationally has shown a
steady improvement over the last few years although the collection rate is
still low. Total collections have risen from P4.8 million in FY69 to P9.2
million in FY74. Over the same period, the collection rate, as a percentage
of fees charged, has improved from almost 50% to about 66%. However, suf-
ficient information is currently not available on the cost of the facilities
or the level of service provided by the NIA systems to determine whether the
rates charged are appropriate. It is possible that in some cases farmers
are charged for water they do not actually receive, and therefore they might
be justified in not paying. There are also indications that collection rates
are better where NIA is providing a reasonable level of service. Thus NIA's
program of irrigation improvement should result in improved collections.
The first phase of the National Irrigation Systems Improvement Study (NISIS),
financed under the Tarlac project, will inventory the national irrigation
systems and when the results,expected by the end of 1975, are available it
should be possible to make a better judgment on the appropriateness of
the water charges and whether NIA's collections have been adequate.



- 12 -
36.       For this project, as for the other Bank-assisted irrigation proj-
ects in Central Luzon, NIA has agreed to gradually increase the water rates
in the project area over a period of five years from completion of construc-
tion to a level sufficient to cover operation and maintenance costs and to
recover (without interest) the total investment cost over not more than the
50-year life of the project taking into account farmers' incentives and ca-
pacity to pay. A gradual increase in irrigation fees from a level equivalent
to about 2.5 cavans (125 kilograms) of paddy per ha in the wet season and 3.5
cavans (175 kilograms) in the dry season to a level equivalent to about 3.5
cavans (175 kilograms) of paddy per ha in the wet season and 4.4 cavans (220
kilograms) in the dry season would meet these requirements (Section 4.03(b)
(ii) of the draft Loan Agreement). The rates to be introduced would vary
between 12% and 17% of farmers incremental net value of production (before
water charges) _depending on present and future cropping intensities.
Prolect Cost and Financing
37.       The project is estimated to cost a total of US$84 million equiva-
lent of which US$29 million would be in foreign exchange. The Bank would
finance US$42 million or one-half of the total project cost; that is the
foreign exchange cost plus US$13 million of local currency requirements (for
justification see paragraph 15 above). The Government would finance the
balance of $42 million. To ensure a timely and continuous flow of funds,
the Government would as a condition of effectiveness of the Loan Agreement,
set up a special fund for the project and replenish it at monthly intervals
to a level equivalent to the estimated total amount of payments for goods
and services required for the project during the next three months less the
estimated amount of payments to be made by the Bank to suppliers, contractors
and consultants (Section 5.01(a) of the draft Loan Agreement). The fund
would ensure rapid payment of civil works contractors which would help at-
tract small contractors.
Procurement
38.       Equipment and vehicles for force account construction, operation
and maintenance, for the Stage II studies and for water management training,
costing about US$4.5 million would be procured after international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. A preference limited to
15% of the c.i.f price of imported goods, or the customs duty, whichever is
lower, would be extended to local manufacturers in the evaluation of bids.
Local shopping is appropriate for off-the-shelf items costing less than
US$10,000 each, because the advantages of international competitive bidding
would be clearly outweighed by administrative costs involved. The total
cost of such items would not exceed US$300,000.
39.       Works on the modification of the MARIS diversion dam and intake
structures (US$6.1 million) would be let as one contract, subject to inter-
national competitive bidding. Works on the project service area (US$37.8
million) would be scattered over a wide area and include a large proportion
of rehabilitation works. These would have to be executed on short notice



- 13 -
to avoid the growing season and bad weather and would have to be phased
with irrigation releases. When similar works were advertised under the
Upper Pampanga River Irrigation Project, the NIA failed to attract even
local contractors. NIA is carrying out all work in Stage IA of the project
by force account and in the process should build up a substantial construc-
tion capability, which would be available for employment in Stage IB. It
is unrealistic, however, for NIA to expect to undertake all work in the
project by force account. NIA will therefore investigate ways of expanding
the execution of civil works by contract (Section 3.07(c) of the draft Loan
Agreement); the amount of work done by force account will not exceed 40%
of the total cost of the work (Schedule 4 paragraph 4(b) to the draft Loan
Agreement). Competitive bidding in accordance with local procedures is
appropriate for the balance of the work. Bank staff have reviewed the
procedures for both local shopping and local competitive bidding and they
are acceptable. There is potentially adequate competition and foreign
firms can participate.
Disbursements
40.       Disbursements would be made at the rate of 100% against the c.i.f.
cost of directly imported equipment, 100% against the ex-factory cost of
locally manufactured equipment and 65% for imported equipment procured
locally. For services of consultants and for technical assistance, disburse-
ments would cover 100% of foreign exchange cost or 60% of total cost
at the discretion of NIA. Disbursements for civil works would be at 42% of
certified monthly progress payments or expenditures. For civil works
contractors' mobilization and equipment, disbursements would cover 100% of
foreign exchange cost.
Benefits and Justification
41.       The proposed Stage I project would contribute to the Philippine
Government's objectives of attaining self-sufficiency in food grains and
improving the productivity of small farmers. In so doing, it would help
strengthen the balance of payments and raise rural incomes. The project
would provide better water control and would extend the area under run-of-
the-river irrigation from 40,000 ha to 75,000 ha in the wet season and from
19,000 ha to 29,000 ha in the dry season. Yields would increase due to
improved irrigation, drainage and agricultural supporting services. At
full development, annual paddy production in the project area would increase
from the present level of 189,000 tons to 422,000 tons. The increase would
provide enough rice to feed about one-and-a-half million people per year.
Net foreign exchange savings as a result of reduced rice imports would be
about US$27 million a year. Per capita incomes on average size farms would
increase from a weighted average of about US$105 at present to about
US$220 in 1985 (at constant 1975 prices). The project would benefit directly
some 24,000 poor paddy farmers who, with their families, comprise about
144,000 people.



- 14 -
42.       Since the newly irrigated areas are currently being farmed under
rainfed conditions and since Stage I would provide additional water for
only modestly increased double cropping, the project would give rise to
only a small increase in the demand for farm labor. The increased rice
production from the project would, however, tend to generate additional
jobs in the transport, processing, marketing and service sectors. The im-
proved farming practices brought about through the proposed project would
make it easier to shift to full double cropping if and when dry season ir-
rigation water becomes available through construction of Stage II. In that
case, an additional 8.5 million man-days of farm labor would be needed.
43.       In the economic analysis, Stage I was treated as a unit since its
division into sub-stages is purely for administrative convenience (para 8).
Assuming a 50-year project life, prices for rice and fertilizer based on
the Bank's commodity price forecasts and a seasonally variable shadow wage
rate for unskilled farm labor, the economic rate of return on the Stage I
project would be about 18%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that even under
a number of adverse assumptions, the rate of return would not fall below 12%.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENT AND AUTHORITY
44.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of
the Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed separately
to the Executive Directors. The draft Agreement conforms to the normal
pattern for loans for irrigation projects. The setting up of an organization
to carry out the project and the setting up of the Special Fund referred to
in paragraphs 33 and 37 would be conditions of effectiveness of the loan.
45.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
46.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   Projects in Execution --
Ln. No. 637-PH      Upper Pampanga River Irrigation; US$34.0 million Loan
of August 18, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
This is the first major irrigation project in the Philippines and
will supply water year-round to nearly all its 84,000 ha command area. The
project's on-farm development scheme is setting a pattern for future irriga-
tion development in the country.   Some delays were caused by the floods in
1972, but construction has progressed satisfactorily since then. All works
will be substantially completed in 1975 and the loan entirely disbursed by
June 30, 1976, the Closing Date. Project costs have increased 72% over
appraisal estimates, largely as a result of rapid inflation, the effects of
successive devaluations of the peso, and design changes in the dam (which
accounted for about one-quarter of the increase in costs). However, as a
result of the close coordination established between irrigation and agricul-
tural supporting services, the project is expected to reach full development
in 7 years after completion of construction, instead of 13 years which was
the appraisal estimate. Also, there are added benefits from early closure
of the dam resulting in water storage and releases sooner than planned, and
nearly 7,000 ha have been added to the project, mostly by including lands
which were formerly under a private irrigation system. Finally, there has
been a considerable increase in the projected world market price of rice.
As a result, the rate of return is about the same as at appraisal.
Ln. No. 720-PH      Rice Processing and Storage; US$14.3 million Loan of
February 4, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
This project provides long-term credit through the Development
Bank of the Philippines to finance a program for the development and modern-
ization of the rice and corn processing industry. Originally the project
was restricted to rice and to the private sector, and the emphasis was on
the construction of new integrated rice mills with large capacities. Due
in part to poor harvests and in part to large cost increases for rice mills,
the demand for sub-loans for new integrated rice mills turned out to be
small, and, as expalined in the President's Memorandum dated June 8, 1972
(R72-40), the loan agreement was amended to shift the project emphasis to
rehabilitation bf existing rice milling facilities. In spite of this the
project made little progress. The loan agreement was amended again in
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

April, 1974 basically (J) to expand the scope of the project to include
corn in addition to rice, (ii) to enable local governments and the National
Grains Authority to borrow funds under the project, and (iii) to streamline
procurement procedures (President's memorandum SecM74-244 of April 15, 1974).
As a result of these amendments, the project is now progressing satisfactori-
ly and the loan is expected to be fully disbursed long, before the revised
Closing Date, June 30, 1977.
Ln. No. 731-PR      Highway; US$8.0 million Loan of April 14, 1971;
Closing Date: May 15, 1975
The project is financing the construction and improvement of the
Cotabato - Digos road in Mindanao (160 km.). Construction is only 55% com-
plete based on the original scope of works, the delay being mainly due to
civil disturbances and army activity on part of the road representing about
20% of the total roadworks. As there is little chance of the contractor
being able to enter this area, the Bank has agreed to a Government proposal
to delete this stretch of the road from the contract and eventually execute
the work by force account; the undisbursed amount of the loan fund will be
applied to the balance of works which can be completed by contract. The
total project cost, allowing for the reduced scope of works, is still esti-
mated at US$15.8 million, the same as the appraisal estimate. Construction
progress is slightly behind the revised work schedule, which foresees com-
pletion by May 31, 1975. Consulting services for detailed engineering of
roads now constructed under the Second Highway Project (Loan 950-PH) were
completed in late 1973. UNDP financed road feasibility studies and a high-
way technical assistance program, which also form part of the project, were
completed in the same year. Technical assistance to the Department of Public
Highways is continuing with Bank financing under the Second Highway Project.
Ln. No. 809-PH and   Fifth Power; US$22.0 million Loan and US$10.0 million
Cr. No. 296-PH       Credit of_April 3, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance the construction of a second thermal unit of 150-MW at Bataan and
transmission facilities in Luzon. After initial delays, the project is
proceeding satisfactorily. Major equipment is being manufactured and the
unit is expected to be commissloned during the second quarter of 1976. con-
strucionf work is continuing on 230 kV transmission lines.    NPC's financial
situation has been improved by the imposition in July t973 of a surcharge to
cover increased fuel costs. A further tariff increase was approved, effec-
tive July 1, 1974. But due to recent inflation this would not enable NPC to
achieve the covenanted rate of return of 8 percent.   NPC has therefore
increased tariff effective July 1, 1975.

Ln. No. 823-PH      Livestock; US$7.5 million Loan of May 25, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project is assisting Government in carrying out its livestock
development program through credit supervised by the Development Bank of the
Philippines. The start of DBP lending operations was delayed by about six
months because of late appointment of technical staff. Although sub-loan
commitments were slow as a result of this, they are now improving, and all
funds are expected to be fully committed by December, 1975. The project
has expanded the agricultural credit capability of DBP into a new and
important field thus meeting a previously unsatisfied demand for small to
medium scale livestock development finance.
Cr. No. 472-PH      Aurora-Penaranda Irrigation; US$9.5 million Credit of
May 14, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Ln. No. 984-PH      Aurora-Penaranda Irrigation; US$9.5 million Loan of
May 14, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This is the second irrigation development and rehabilitation pro-
ject in the Philippines to be financed by the Bank. The project will divel:
water from the Aurora basin into the Pantabangan Reservoir of the first pro-
ject, to provide year-round irrigation for 25,300 ha of rice land in Central
Luzon. The project also includes an Irrigation Development Study for Central
Luzon to inventory water, land, and other resources and identify priority
irrigation projects. Although there has been some delay in constructing the
two diversion dams because of the need for more extensive foundations and
abutment area grouting than originally expected, most difficulties have been
overcome and the work is progressing satisfactorily. It is anticipated that
diversion of 75% of Aurora water into Pantabangan Reservoir will be feasible
by early 1976, some six to eight months ahead of the appraisal schedule. In
the service area, lack of competition and high bids have delayed awarding
of contracts. Urgent work is being done by Government forces, although the
Credit Agreement sets a force account limit of about 20% on civil works
in the service area. Project costs have increased about 54% over appraisal
estimates, largely as a result of rapid inflation. There would be added
benefits from early diversion, however, resulting in additional water for
irrigation sooner than planned, and the rate of return is expected to
fall from 17% at appraisal to 14%.
Ln. No. 998-PH      Industrial Investment and Smallholder Tree-farmers:
US$50.0 million Loan of June 12, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The proceeds of the loan are being relent to the Development Bank
of the Philippines (DBP). The industrial portion of the loan (US$48 mil-
lion) is being used by DBP to make sub-loans to finance direct imports for
medium and relatively large industrial projects. DBP is using the balance
(US$2 million) to finance about 1,300 smallholders in a pilot tree-farming
project. The loan became effective on September 9, 1974. Since then,
commitments for sub-loans totalling. $21.2 million have been made.

Page 6
Ln. No. 1010-PH     Third Rural Credit; US$22.0 million Loan of June 17, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The Central Bank relends the proceeds of the Loan (except for a
small amount for an evaluation study) to participating banks. These on-lend
the funds to farmers and rural entrepreneurs to finance investment in farm
mechanisation, on-farm transportation, farm support facilities and equip-
ment, coastal and inland fisheries, small-scale livestock development and
cottage-scale agro-industry. The project also provides for a review by
local experts of the first, second and third rural credit projects. The
loan became effective on August 27, 1974. It is progressing satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 1034-PH     Sixth Power; US$61.0 million Loan of July 31, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance a 100MW hydro plant at Pantabangan and transmission lines for the
further expansion of the Luzon grid and feasibility studies by consultants
for a future power project. Major equipment for the plant has been con-
tracted and project commissioning is expected by the end of 1976. The
transmission system expansion is also proceeding satisfactorily. NPC raised
its tariff on July 1, 1974 to meet the covenanted rate of return of 8 percent.
But due to recent inflation NPA would not be able to achieve this. NPC
therefore increased tariff effective July 1, 1974.
Cr. No. 349-PH      Second Education; US$12.7 million Credit of January 5,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The project is assisting Government to improve such areas as educa-
tion planning, management and curriculum development, science teacher
training, and training of technicians, skilled craftsmen and farmers. The
project is currently a few months behind schedule, but the delay is being
reduced through action by the project unit on civil works, designs and
equipment procurement. The project is expected to be completed on schedule.
Current problems include unexpected cost overruns (42% higher than the
original estimate), difficulty in introducing reforms in admissions, and
quality standards of project agricultural colleges. The government has
agreed to finance overruns and is considering steps to solve the other prob-
lems. Disbursements have started and are expected to remain ahead of, or on,
schedule until project completion.
Ln. No. 891-PH       Fisheries; US$11.6 million Loan of May 21, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This project is designed to provide long term credit to the private
sector through the Development Bank of the Philippines for marine and inland
fisheries development. The loan became effective on December 5, 1973. The
demand for loans is adequate, and the organization to implement them has
been properly established. The project is progressing satisfactorily, and
all funds are expected to be fully committed by December, 1975.

Ln. No. 939-PH      Second Ports; US$6.1 million Loan of October 24, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
This project provides for the rehabilitation and expansion of the
ports of General Santos and Cagayan de Oro in the island of Mindanao. Bids
for the civil works for both ports were opened on November 22, 1974, with
only one bid received for each port. Bidding results for the works at
Cagayan de Oro were substantially higher than the appraisal cost estimates
and the consultants' estimate of August 1974. The works at Cagayan de Oro
have been re-bid and a contract awarded. The works at General Santos are
in their initial phase of mobilization.
Ln. No. 950-PH      Second Highway; US$68.0 million Loan of December 12,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project is helping the Government to implement its program of
construction, improvement and rehabilitation of highways and feeder roads,
by financing the construction, improvement and rehabilitation of 1400 kms.
of roads in Luzon. Work has begun on all fourteen contracts, ten of which
were awarded to local contractors. In line with world-wide inflation, costs
have increased sharply during the past 12 months, but price adjustments are
being awarded to contractors by the Government to offset the sharp rises in
costs of basic materials, fuels and labor. The UNDP financed Road Feasi-
bility Studies (Phase II), for which the Bank is Executing Agency, are
progressing satisfactorily and a possible Third Highway project has already
been identified. Execution of other minor project items is proceeding
generally on schedule.
Ln. No. 1035-PH     Population; US$25.0 million Loan of July 31, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The project is assisting the Government in expanding rural health
infrastructure, staff training facilities, and research and communications
capacity. This will help the Philippines achieve their long-term goal of
fertility reduction. It is progressing satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 1048-PH     Inter-Island Shipping; US$20 million Loan of October 29,
1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The Goverrnment is relending the proceeds of the loan to the De-
velopment Bank of the Philippines for onlending to beneficiaries for the
acquisition of new and used ships and for major repairs and conversions.
The loan became effective on January 15, 1975. It is progressing satis-
factorily.

Ln. No. 1052-PH     Private Development Corporation of the Philippines;
US$30 million Loan of November 12, 1974;
The project assists in the financing of industrial sub-projects
in the Philippines, the bulk of which are expected to go to export-oriented
manufacturing projects. The loan became effective on February 7, 1975. It
is progressing satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 1080-PH     Tarlac Irrigation; US$17.0 million Loan of January 27,
1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1980
The project will assist the Government to improve and expand
34,000 hectares of land in Central Luzon for wet season irrigation for rice
growing. It will also provide for a ground water pilot scheme, a water
management training program and a national irrigation systems improvement
study. The loan became effective on April 27, 1975. It is proceeding
satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 1102-PH     Rural Development; US$25.0 million Loan of April 16,
1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
The project will assist the Government to carry out a rural
development project on the island of Mindoro, which will include infra-
structure and irrigation improvements, and ecological and health improve-
ment measures. The Loan Agreement was signed on April 16, 1975. It is
expected to be effective before July 31, 1975.
