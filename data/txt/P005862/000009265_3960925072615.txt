PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Wadi
Beihan Agricultural Development Project in the People's Democratic
Republic of Yemen (PDRY) for which IDA Credit 1145-YDR was approved in
the sum of US$8.0 million (SDR 6.6 million) on May 19, 1981.   The
Credit was closed on December 31, 1988, one year behind schedule. The
last disbursement took place on September 28, 1988, when the Credit
Was fully disbursed. IFAD provided an additional US$6.0 million (SDR
4.8 million) for financing the project.
The PCR was prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture and
Agrarian Reform.   IDA assisted the Government during preparation of
this PCR. An Overview prepared by Regional Bank staff supplements the
Borrower prepared PCR.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED). The draft PCR Overview was sent to the Borrower on February 6,
1990, for comments by March 27, 1990, but none were received.

PEOPLE'S DEOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YTMEN
WADl BEIHN A=RICLTU&AL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1145-YDR)
PROJECT COMLETION REPORT
Introduction and Obiectives
1.   This  is  the fifth IDA supported agricultural project in  People's
Democratic Republic  of Yemen  (PDRY).   Two of these were  for fisheries
development and the others for development of irrigated agriculture. The project
objectives were to : (a) increase agricultural production and farm income in the
project area; (b) assess the surface and ground water potential of the area; (c)
provide access to important centers of population and agriculture in the area;
and (d) improve nutrition of the rural poor by growing a wider range of crops
and fruits for local consumption.
InplementkR*K1nerion
2.   The project was completed one year behind schedule. This was caused mainly
by the remoteness of the area and delay in the recruitment and retention of the
expatriate and local staff due to lack of living facilities. Furthermore the
devastating floods of 1982, directed some efforts from the project works to
relief measures needed by the population in the project area. The flood further
increased the work quantities originally estimated at appraisal. Other changes
during implementation included: dropping the deepening and lining of 88 wells
due to more than anticipated draw down of the aquifer; reduction of the length
of the feeder road and their upgrading; and the water courses were changed to
buried piped system instead of concrete lined open canals. Aside from these
minor revisions, the project was executed according to plans laid down at
appraisal.
Project Impact
3.    The project had positive impact on increasing the agricultural production
in the area, diversifying the crops grown and raising the standard of living
among the farming community. The area became virtually self-sufficient in its
basic needs of cereals, vegetables, seed legunms and meat, which was accomplished
through improved spate and piped irrigation channels, provision of inputs,



-iv -
extension services and marketing facilities. The economic rate of return
calculated for this project is 24:, the same as wss estimated at appraisal.
Sustainaiw LL&t
4.    The principal factors contributing to suatainability of project benefits
are careful project design compatible vith the socio-economic conditions, trained
manpower assigned for post-project activities, and beneficiary involvement.
Continued government support is going to be an important factor in contributing
to project sustainability. The newly constructed highway to the area would
definitely help in supporting sustainability of the project.
5.    Sustainability of the project would be further insured through balancing
groundwater extraction with recharge, continued maintenance of spate water
pathways, availability of input supply, and provision of marketing facilities.
There is evidence that measures have been taken by the Government to address
these issues. An O&M service in the project area has now been established,
drilling of new wells has been banned, three centers for distribution of input
supplies have been set up, control or. the pricirg  of the agricultural produce
of the area has been relaxed which enables farmers to freely market their
produce, and the agricultural extension service and groundwater monitoring unit
in the area have been maintained.
Lessons Learned
6.   The major lesson of this project is that its success came about by an
interaction of various factors: a satisfacto,.y design at appraisal; strong
Government support; managerially integrated project implement-ition, and local
staff continuity; beneficiary involvement in groundwater and on-farm development;
and an excellent dialogue between Bank staff and the executing agency.
7.    Another lesson to be learned is that in the execution of projects in
remotely located areas, perhaps more time would be needed between effectiveness
and actual implementation of the project. The five year limit on the project was
too ambitious since the area lacked basic infrastructure such as housing, health
care, and prevision of daily household needs, which made recruitment and
retention of the local and expatriate staff difficult. We also learned through
this project that compiling of extensive data on the behavior of the aquifer is
imperative before allowing widespread drilling of wells in the different wadis
of the country.

Introduction:
1.    Wadi Beihan Agricultural Development Project, Credit 1145-YDR, was executed
as part of IDA's strategy towards improved use of the country's limited
agricultural resource base and to maintain a dialogue with the Government on
desirable econow4- policy reforms.  Through this project a remote area was
brought in the country's mainstream of agricultural production by improving its
agricultural production capacity, using better irrigation conveyance methods,
increased agricultural input utilization, improved agricultu-al practices, and
upgraded communication.
2.   This overview is based on the project completion report (PCR) recently
submitted to the Bank as part of the requirement under the project. A brief
summary of the project objectives, activities and accomplishments follows. IDA
was in continuous contact during the preparation of this PCR, and assisted in
the analysis of the economic and financial data. The full text of the PCR as
submitted by the Government is also attached.
3.    It is not intended in this overview to give a detailed account of the
project, crop yields and engineering data, as these are sufficiently covered in
the report. However, an attempt is made to bring out the highlights of the
project and to indicate where the project has been effective and where it failed
to reach the goal laid out at appraisal. Detailed statistical data on all
aspects of the project are included in the attached text submitted by the
Government.
Proiect Oblectives and DescrintLona
4.     The objectives of the project were to: i) increase agricultural production
and farm income in the project area by: (a) rehabilitating the spate irrigation
network and improving the groundwater irrigation system of Wadi Beihan, and (b)
providing technical assistance, farm inputs and agricultural machinery for both



-vi. -
Wadi Beihan and Wadi Ain; (ii) assess the surface and groundwater potential of
the area and confirm the technical feasibility of attaining a stable groundwater
level within reasonable limits of aquifer draw-down under existing groundwater
usage in Wadi Beihan by setting up a program of hydrometeorological observations;
(iii) provide access to important centers of population and agriculture in the
Arep to feciiltate mov'ement of agri±cltural inputs and -red$¶-ee by Conetructing
feeder roads and providing maintenance equipment; and (iv) improve nutrition of
the rural poor by growing a wider range of crops and fruits for local
consumption.
5.    The Project components included: (i) establishment of Project management,
engineering, and agricultural extension services; (ii) provision of farm inputs
and facilitating their distribution in both Wadis Beihan and Ain; (iii)
rehabilitation of spate irrigation of Wadi Beihan and controlling its bank
erosion at vulnerable points; (iv) implementation of well improvement ard on-
farm works in Wadi Beihan; (v) provision of equipment for the Machinery Renting
Stations (MRS) for Wadis Beihan and Ain; (vi) construction of feeder roads in
Wadi Beihan; and (vii) conducting hydrometeorological studies in Wadi Beihan.
Proiect Design and Organization:
6.    The project was prepared and designed to fit the needs of the local
community in a remotely located area. Its relevance was rooted in the need of
the area for greater agricultural production, better use of irrigation water,
with the obiective of enlarging on the pre-project agricultural lands and
expanding of the local capacity for self sufficiency in basic food and feed
needs. The project's strength was due to a down-to-earth approach supporting
and improving on traditional practices, which were easily understood and reatlily
adaptable by local farmers.   It also was in a way innovative for the local
farmers, delivering irrigation water to farmer's fields through conveyance pipes,
decreasing losses through seepage, and increasing irrigation efficiency for
optimal water use. In addition, farmers received credits to improve on their
existing tubewells to insure a sustainable flow of water.   Furthermore, the
extension service advocated new technologies, such as the use of bette crop
varieties and improved cultural practices.
7.    In summary, the project provides a good example of a project design which
is conducive to good management. In macro terms, the design assured management
of firm Government commitment and support; in technical terms, the design ensured
correct technologies as basic tools for management, and at the farm level, the
design assured farmers' participation through the provision of improvements
promoting production.
8.    Through  the project and for the first  time,  the hydrological  and
hydrogeological data were collected on a scientific basis, to monitor the aquifer
and spate water flow in the project area,using instrumentation and methodology
which would be sustainable in the long run.
9.    The appraisal mission realized that there were certain problems and issues
they had to put in the foreground for the Government to tackle. Foremost among



- vii -
these was the difficult nature of the area which made recruiting and retaining
of the local and expatriate staff difficult. To solve this problem it suggested
immediate construction of living quarters for the staff. Another issue was that
the hydrological survey available to them indicated that the groundwater level
would drop if drilling wells went ahead uncontrolled. It suggested a constant
WlatAl v'u t96; aquil feL Lu mo!ituz  zeiaage aut-iu u'LawdowU  ult a Legu'IaL lbaa, .  Is
also suggested that new wells be permitted only under exceptional cases. It also
called for some institutional changes for facilitating marketing of the
agricultural produce of the area, to review agricultural prices and taxation
policy. and to minimize subsidies.
Proiect Revisions:
10.   The project generally adhered to its appraisal targets, except for minor
changes carried out in response to new findings.   For example,  the well
improvement component, comprising the deepening and lining of 38 wells, was
dropped because of more than anticipated depletion ir. water table. For improving
water efficiency, the water courses on farmers' land, originally planned to be
retained and lined with concrete, were changed to low pressure buried pipe
system. The length of feeder roads and number of extension centers were reduced
to meet requirements determined on the basis of actual needs and design surveys.
Also spate irrigation and erosion control works substantially exceeded appraisal
estimates. This was due mainly to the devastating floods of 1982, and
constructing or improving some 14 km length of main canals and several small
canals beyond the scope of the project, in response to farmers' requests to
protect their dwellings and farmlands from the menace of high periodic spate
water flow. Land leveling activities were also below the estimated target as
farmers were reluctant to carry out the land leveling operation on their farms.
They rightly suspected that removal of the top soil would render the land less
productive.
Proiect Costs:
11.   The project cost at completion increased slightly over the appraisal
estimate, from US$18.12 million at appraisal to US$ 19.34 at completion. The
difference of US$1.22 million was supplemanted by the Government (see Table 18
of Borrower PCR). The increased costs resulted mainly from additional works
generated by the devastating flo'ods of 1982, in addition to improvement of the
design of the feeder roads over -.-at was suggested at appraisal.  IDA Credit of
US$8.0 million and IFAD Loan of US$6.0 million were fully disbursed.
Prolect Results and Impact:
12.   The project had a substantial impact on the agricultural development of
the area. It succeeded in raising the standard of living through increased crop
production Which made the arisa ViLtua'ly s61f su?EffiU.,,t In its basis 1-neda of
cereals, vegetables, seed legumes and meat.   This was accomplished through
conjunctive use of surface and groundwater and on-farm development, mainly by
the use of piped irrigation systems in areas served by tubewells.   Spate
irrigation pathways were improved by building traditional structures with



- vii -
equipment and materials supplied under the project. Groundwater and on-farm
development was promoted by the provision of credit to the farmers. The project
also introduced drip irrigation methodology to the area through establishment
of 1.5 ha drip irrigation system as a demonstration to be adopted by project
farmers. The project further set up a 15 ha experimental farm inside one of the
state farms in the area, complete with about i.5 km road system, 375 km piped
irrigation network, 4 hydrants, and an experimental sprinkler system to cover
about 2 ha. Since this demonstration was set up in the last year of the project,
its impact on the agricultural development in the project area would be
anticipated at a later date.
13.   Agricultural services were also improved under the project.  An extension
program was set in motion which regularly advised farmers on the use of improved
methodology to increase crop and livestock yields using better seeds, better
plant protection techniques, and better cultural and management practices. A
nursery was also established to provide project farmers with needed fruit tree
seedlings suitable for the area. Chemical fertilizers were also made available,
in addition to plant protection materials and sprayers. Furthermore, veterinary
services were provided through carrying out vaccination campaigns and curative
treatment for sheep and cattle against prevailing diseases in the area. Also,
15.5 kus of feeder roads were constructed which facilitated marketing and input
transfer.
14.   As a result of the above activities, wheat and barley yields incressed by
about 1002, sesame and onion by about 602, and sorghum and millet by about 50X.
In addition to yield increases, area grown to each crop was also increased,
notably onion, high yielding wheat variety, summer vegetables and alfalfa.
Garlic cultivation which was unknown earlier was also greatly expanded. (Please
see Table 1).
15.   The ERR calculated for the project is 241, same as that estimated at
appraisal (Table 2). Although production increases at completion were higher
than those projected at appraisal, this was offset by the lower economici prices
for some of the major crops grown in the area, notably wheat, sesame,and onion
(Table 3).
Environmental Impact:
16.  Increased crop, fruit and animal production added to the well being of the
inhabitants, providing for better nutrition and health. Erosion control also
helped protect villages and farmlands from the onslaught of high floods. Use
of chemical fertilizers and pesticides was carried out under the guidance of the
extension agents with minimum effects on the environment and health of the
inhabitants. However, increased number of tubewells in the area resulted in the
drawdown of the aquifer. Farmers, realizing the production potential of the area
under irrigation and sound managerial practices, increased the number of
tubewells, which were increased from 822 tubewells in 1980 to 1127 by 1988,
adversely affecting the aquifer.

Staff Tralisng:
17.   A good degree of success was achieved in the realization of institutional
development objectives through staff continuity (especially counterpart staff)
and effective training.   A total of 117.5 man-month (m) of overseas training
has been utilized since the start of the project. The training was in extension
(75 mm), irrigation (24 mm), hydrology (9 mm), mechanization (6 mm), project
management (2 mm), and cooperative administration and planning (18.5 mm). Some
17 staff members trained had positive impact on the project. In addition, 87
mm of in-country training were provided for the extension staff which resulted
in better comprehension of extension methodology.   Effective training and
manpower development was apparent in establishing agricultural supporting
services. Part of the trained engineering staff has been assigned since the
completion of the works to manage operation and maintenance activities.
SustainabilItU
18. In the project, the Bank and the Government opted for conjunctive
development of surface and groundwater. The project put emphasis on maintaining
and repairing the traditional structures in the spate pathways. This approach
could be construed as the use of "appropriate technology". The project also
helped in establishing the dominance and relative efficiency of privately
financed and maintained pumped irrigation.   Both these factors and strong
Government support would assist in assuring project sustainability.
19.   In pursuance of the Dev,lopaent Credit Agreement Section 5.04, the Ministry
of Agriculture has established an Irrigation and Maintenance Unit to maintain
irrigation infrastructure laid down under the pr ject. The Unit is headed by
a qualified technician, and assisted by some skilled workers and a store keeper.
An estimated budget of YD 26,000 has been set aside for the first year, which
is considered satisfactory. Repair works beyond the capability of the task force
will be carried out by the Machinery Renting Station (MRS).
20.   Sustainability would also be ensured through continued input supply to the
project area. With the construction of the new highway connecting Nisab with
the project area, it is expected that this constraint would be minimized. Three
distribution centers have already been set up by the Government in the area for
this purpose.
21.  To avoid extra drawdown of the aquifer, it would be important to maintain
restrictions on drilling of new tubewells in the area. In addition to monitoring
of surface and groundwater measurement, judicious use of irrigation water and
maintenance of the spate water pathways will greatly enhance sustainability of
the project benefits. Legislation has now been enacted to restrict drilling
of new wells in the area to protect the aquifer from further depletion. The
monitoring unit established under the project has been retained to continue its
activities.
22. The Government has eased its control on prices of some of the crops in
the area (onion and garlic), which are more or less based on supply and demand.

Furthermore, marketing facilities have also been provided through establishment
of three marketing centers in the project area.
Bank Performace:
23.  The appraisal mission performed well and, except for minor changes, the
targets set for the project were met. Technical input by the Bank contributed
to the success of the project. However, early supervision activities were less
than satisfactory due to remoteness of the area and lack of facilities which,
caused Bank staff to minimize visits and shorten time spent on the proiect. In
addition, supervision missions included mainly engineers and economists with
insufficient review of the agricultural and financial sides of the project. There
could have been a more balanced make up of the supervision missions.
Nevertheless, there was excellent dialogue between Bank staff and the executing
agency during the course of project implementation.   Also, of the eleven
supervision missions, the last five were more timely and balanced.
Borrower's Performance:
24.  The Borrower generally performed well and gave full support to the project
during implementation, providing the needed logistic support to the supervision
missions. It also adhered to the technical recommendations advanced by these
missions as much as was feasible. However, during the first two years of the
project it faced difficulties in recruiting and retaining sufficient qualified
staff to implement the project. It also faced managerial difficulties evidenced
by the problems highlighted by the supervision reports. These shortcomings led
to delay in the implementation of the project one year behind schedule.
tosltn  SenrvIces:
25.  Under a Trust Fund Agreement with the Food and Agricultural Organization,
FAO, advisors were recruited to assist in project management and to advise on
the technical aspects of the project's hydrological, hydrogeological and
agricultural needs. The project Authorities were not always happy with FAO's
choice of the expatriate staff as some of them had little experience in the type
of activities needed under the project. FAO also had little choice in selecting
expatriate staff of high calibre due to remoteness of the project area and lack
of facilities in the initial stages of project implementation. Subsequently,
some individual advisors performed well, and contributed valuable technical
inputs to the project, including irrigation development, collection of
hydrological and hydrogeological data on spate and wadi flow and monitoring of
the aquifer.
26.  The project management indicates in its PCR that perhaps the post of the
Chief Technical Advisor (CTA) was not necessary, and that a CTA with an
engineering background would have been preferred (Para. 7.02 refers). It is felt
that due to lack of experience of the local staff in project management, the
CTA was sine qua non for the project and that CTAs' assigned to the project
contributed positively towards a better organization and management of the
project, without which the project would not have attained its objectives.



- xi -
Furthermore, due to presence of two other engineers on the staff of the project,
it was not necessary that CTA be an engineer.   Hence the choice of an
agriculturist with a management background was the right one.
Project Documentation and Data:
27.   The Staff Appraisal Report provided a useful instrument for project follow
up. Reporting of project activities were more or less regular. However, project
auditing was delayed due to absence of an accountant for some time at the proJect
site. At a later date,i.e., about midway in the project implementation period,
a competent accountant was on post and auditing was reported oIL schedule.
D. Studies:
28.   Through the project, hydrological, hydrogeological, and meteorological
information were collected to determine the amount of spate water flow in the
Wadi and changes in the aquifer. The water levels and salinity values were
determined for 151 wells over a period of time, before and after floods, to
determine any changes that may have occurred. The surface water flow records
were systematically observed only as of 1986, which was statistically
insufficient to formulate a basis for predicting future probable discharge and
estimating annual quantity of water flow. However, it was found that serious
depletion of the aquifer was taking place due to excessive pumping and
uncontrolled drilling of wells.   This was brought to the attention of the
authorities which issued an ordinance to stop the drilling of new wells.
E. Status of the Covenauts:
29.   Legal covenants were generally complied with.  In the case of one covenant
(Section 4.10, of the Development Credit Agreement), the agreement was that: "The
Borrower shall (i) review with the Association the study carried out under part
2 of the Development Credit Agreement (Credit Number 768-YDR) (Wadi Tuban
Project) dated March 22,1978, between the Borrower and the Association, within
six months of the completion of the said study; and (ii) within one year of the
completion of the review of the said study, commence the implementation of such
recommendations of the said study as may be agreed upon between the Borrower and
the Association".   The study was completed in 1982, and IDA advised the
Government that the consultant's report had serious analytical weaknesses and
omissions, and proposed that such policies and issues be discussed in the context
of a dialogue on overall sectoral performance. Hence, it was decided not to
pursue this covenant further under the project, but to take it up instead as part
of a sectoral dialogue to be pursued by IDA on selected policy issues.
Lessons Learned:
30.   The project was  successful  from  the  agricultural,  engineering and
institution building aspects. The major lesson which can be learned from the
project is that its success came about from an interaction of good project
design,  integrated management and beneficiary involvement.   Also,  strong
Government support was a key factor in achieving successful completion.



- xii -
31.  The difficulty of recruiting expatriate and local staff for project
implementation and the delay in project implementation reflect the difficult
nature of the project area for which sufficient provisions were not made at
appraisal. The five year limit imposed on project completion w"as perhaps too
ambitious. The area lacked infrastructure, such as housing, health care, and
provision of daily household needs to provide for a livable environment for both
local and expatriate staff. In addition, the country lacked qualified staff who
could be delegated to execute the project components. Hence a lesson to be
learned from this project is that one should be realistic at project appraisal
and allocate sufficient time for project implementation, giving advance time to
provide for needed housing and living provisions, in addition to raising the
technical and managerial capabilities of the local staff. This could be achieved
through provision of about two years for the preparation, mobilization and
training, prior to actual project execution.
32.   The Government is now reluctant to hire expatriate advisors due to rising
costs, especially when the salaries are to be paid from borrowed money. If it
would be possible to train sufficient staff during the preparation/mobilization
period (in specialized institutes overseas), it becomes possible to minimize
the number of expatriate staff that would be needed for project execution.
Another alternative is that due to the difficult nature of agricultural
development in the remote areas, PDRY Government may look into the regular
training of its staff in the administrative, technical and financial requirements
of regional projects, if it wishes to achieve its objective of minimizing
dependence on expatriate staff in the future.
33. As mentioned earlier, out of 88 wells surveyed for improvement, only 30
wells were developed, since there were indications that the aquifer was being
depleted fast due to over-pumping and excessive number of wells in the area.
The appraisal mission had emphasized the need for restricting drilling tubewells
in the area. However, the Government was lax on this matter and introduced
legislation only when the situation had become very serious. Unfortunately,
there was also a long period of drought during the period of 1983-1986, which
was unusual and led to the slow recharge of the aquifer. As learned from this
project and due to the scarcity of water in PDRY, it would be judicious that the
Government allow drilling of new wells in the different Wadis of the country only
after conducting thorough hydrological studies to determine the quantity of
water that would be available and the amount of the annual recharge.

PEOPLE'S DE[OCRATIC REPUBILIC OF YEKW
MINISTRY OP AGRICULTE  AND AGRAI REPM
WADI BEIHM? AGRICULTURAL DEVEL0P?OT PROJECT
COMLETION REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
1.01 The Project area is located in the north western part
of the Shabwa Governorate of the People's Democratic Repub3tc
of Yemen (PDRY) where it borders with the Yemen Arab Republic
(YAR) and Saudi Arabia. It covers the sub-governorate
(Mhderiat) of Beihan which comprises three districts (Marakwz)
Al-Ulua, Usylan and Ain with a total population of 54,000.
Wadi Beihan and its tributaries .Nahr and Khirr traverse the
traverse the Beihan and Nuqub districts and Wadi Air passes
through the Ain district (Map IBED 15505). The total Project
grea is estimated at 21,000 hectares, of which about 5000 ha i.
equipped with well irrigation of which 3550 ha is located within
the Wadi leihan's coemand and 1500 ha within the Wadi Ain's
command. The area is linked to Aden by a 100 km road under
construction Joins Aden-Wasit asphalt road. at Wasit (450 km
from Aden).
Major Constraints of the sector
1.02 Natural resources are very limited, in addition the 1982
defastating floods followed by a series of drought in recent
years caused a serious depression of crop production. Insuffi-
cient flexibility in production de'%tsions and inadequate
incentives to produccz,s. The growth of the sector is embeded
by lack of adoptable applied research, and untimely supplies



-2-
of inputs, tractors and machinery for cuttivation and the
chronic management problems,for a large number of coop-
erxtives and state farms.
Institutional Changes during the Project
1,03 - The prices of onions and grrlic were changed toward
somewhat a supply and demand basis throughout the year,
- Three marketing centres were established throughout
the project area,
- A new land aboutment tax is under consideration to
replace the production tax, 
- The number of operating wells increa-"ed from 822 in
1980 to 1127 in 1988, consequently the cultivated area
increased by about 1000 ha. causing a continuous mining of
the aluifer and gradual lowering of the water table,
- The roads Naqaba-Nosab (651km) and Nissab-Wasit (25km)
were constructed under the IDA third highway Project. UNODP
store was built at Nuqub in the project area, and
- Opening of cold store in Beihan main town, which
intermittently sells frozen chicken, fish and imported meat.
ObSectives
1.04 Project objectives are to : (i) increase agricultural
production and farm income in the Project area by : (a) re-
habilitating the spate irrigation network and i proving the
groundwater irrigation system of Wadi Beihanx, and (b) prov-
iding technical assistance, farm inputs and agricultural
machinery for both Wadi Beihan and Wadi Ain; (ii) assess the
surface and groundwater potential of the area and confirm
the technical feasibility of attaining a stable groundwater
usage in Wadi Beihan, by setting up a progra of ?qdrometeorm
ological obervations; (iii) provide access to i     ,portant
centers of population and agriculture in the area to facilitate
movement of agricltural inputs and produce by constructing
feeder roads and providing maintenance equipment; and (iv)



3
improve nutrition of the rural poor by growing a wider range
of crops and fruits for local consumption.
1.05 It is the intention of the Govern ment to use the Project
as a vbhicle for establishing a structured on-going program of
the Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform (MAAR) in the
Beihan sub-governorate.
1.06 The 5400 populated Beihan district became the focus of
attention by many financiers, IDA, OPEC and Kuwait Fund to
finance the 4th Highway project part I and 2 (Waset-Beihan)
of 123km which is under construction. Discovery of commercial
quantities of oil in north and north eastern surroundings
of the area, and plans to construct the beihan-Hareeb road are
under consideration. Proposal for the phase 2 for develeopment
of the project area is under preparation.
F1 FORMULATION
2.01 Development of Wadi Beihan is of major concern to the
government sihe this area, located in a border zone, faces a
serious problemsoof isolation, depletion of the resource base,
neglected maintenance of the productive infrastructure, low
agricultural productivity and exodus of the labour force to
neighbouring oil producing countries. The area is particularly
important to the gove5nment since it offers the only sig-
nificant potential for development in this part of the
country. With 15% of the country's total well irrigated land,
it constitutes a sizeable proportion of the agricultural
resource base, and could thus contribute substattially to the
Second Pive Year Plan's national goals.
2.02 The government of the People's Democratic Republic of
Yemen requested assistance from IDA to help finance an
agricultural project in Wadi Beihan and Wadi Ain which comprises



_4.-
The Shabwa Governorate. i4consulting firm (SOGREAH) was
retained in 1977 by the gcvernment to evaluate the potential
for agricultural development in Wadi Beihan. They submitted
the General Plan of Agr sliltaral Development on Wadi Beihan in
Decembor 1979 and further studies. to improve its spate irri-
gation. in July 1980.  These studies and the information cv1-
lected by the FAO/IBRD Cooperation Program's(10/1O2) miesion
which was sent to the area in March 1980,(and prepared a
report dated September 26, 1980) formed the basis for ap-
praisal ec5 the Project by the Bank mission which visited PDRY
in October/November, 1980.
Sogreah formilated five major alternatives in its final
report 1979. A major component was high investment in spate
irrigation system improvement but this was later rejected
due to the un-realiability of spate flow information. In
general however, the project was an extraction fV9% the five
alternatives. Tn have realiable data on spate flows through-
out the project life, a component for monitoring surface and
ground-water resources was included.
Preparation and Aupraisal:
2.03 Tfhe report submitted by SOGREAH and the findings of the
IBED/ItO .P  -itssien formed the basis for the appraisal of
the project by the World Bank mission which visited PDRY
in Oct/Now 1980. The result to the IDA' s staff appraisal
report No. 3352-YDR which was submitted on April 1981 was the
birth of the Wadi Beihan Agricultural Developnent Project.
2.04 On July 27, 1981 a development Credit -greemennt between
the PDRY and IDA -s signed under Credit Nunber 1145_YDR and
a loan agreement between the PDRY and IFPD under credit No.
068-YD. Under the agreement the PDRY governzent was to
finance 22% or US$ 4.12 million equivalent, project benef-
iciarvies 1% or US 5 0.2 million equivalant. IDA 44% or US$
8.0 million equivalent and IFAD 33% or US$ 6.0 million
equivalent of the project costs. The Draft Credit AJgreement
became effective on April 16, 1982.



Agreement became effective on 4pril 16, 1982.
2.05 Assurance was given by the government (and included in
the DCA 1145-YDR) on the following =nong other issues :-
a) establishment under the Ministry of Agriculture and
6Egarian Reform of the Beihan Project Unit (BPU) I
b) employment of qualified and experienced expatriate
staff to carry out the Project, with national counter-
parts,
c) subsidiary loan agreement with NBY for chanelling
sub-loans to beneficiaries
d) procurement.of all goods involving foreign exchange,
except for locally procured items to an aggregate not
exceeding US 3 200,000 through international shopping,
in accordance with the guidelines for procurement under
World Bank Loans and IDA Credit.
e) monitoring of the abstraction of the ground water
resources
f) ensuring, after the completion of the project, the
continuous supply of farm inputs to the project are,, at
reasonable levels, and to maintain spate improvement and
erosion control works and the feeder roads.
Proiect Rationale Description:
2.06 The main objective of the project was to increase

Wadi Beihan command area.
Part G:      Provision of agricultural equipment and  a
mobile workshop for Machine Renting Station
for the Proiect area.



-7-
Part E:  Establishment of orchards for cultivation of
130 ha of fruits in the proJect area.
Part I:   Establishment of a program of hydrogeological
and meteorological studies to assess the surface
and groundwater potential *   he Wadi Beihan
command area; throuwh establishing of one weather
station, two rainfall stations, and three river
gauge recording statioas.
The Project was compleded on 31st December,, 1988.
Oranization: .
2.0? It was agreed that project implementation
would be responsibility of the Beihan Project
Unit (BPUt) to be establ4shed in Beihan under
the Department of Planning and Statistics of
the Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform.
(MAAR) BPET was to be headed by a project manager
and a Tichnical Coordinator (senior adviser to
the project manager), assisted by an Irrigation
Engineer, an Extens-on specialist,an hydrologist,
counterparts and adninistration staff.
2.08 A central Coordination Committee headed by
the Deputy Minister of Agriculture and include
as members: Directors of the related departments
of the MAAR to the -roject works. It will
include in its membership a provincial director
of agriculture. At district level, the BPUT
would also work in close coordination with
Beihan commissioner, the secretary -if the
party, the director of agriculture, NBY,MRS,the
four comperatives, two state farms and PCMFV.



2.09 The BPU would comprise of six units: irrigation and
hydrogiology, extension and plant protection, animal
production and health, monitoring and evaluation, adnin-
istration and accounts, an' inaut voDoumexLt  and distri-
bution. Thts extension service would re:  ..r technical
back-stopping on the Departmant of Extension of fV*;.R, and
for the applied research on the experimontal farm on the
El-,'>d research staff.
2.10 Prefabricated buildings, equipments and materials and
farm inputs would be procured through international shopping
on the basis of comparing not less than three price quotations.
Extension centers, stores nursery and experimental farm
and feeder roads shall be constructed on the basis of neg-
otiated contracts entered into. Spate irrigation, bank
erosion works, and on-farm improvement works would be carried
out by the BPU, on the basis of force account. Because of
the number of equipment units to be purchased for the project
being small they would be cf same rakes under the project
as is already available in the country. Procurement and-
construction contracts would be carried out in procedures
satisfactory to ODA.
2.11 No environmental ha;ards due to project works were
envisaged during appraisal.
2.12 Physical and instructional parts of the project would
provide basis for future expansion.
Cost Estimates:
2.12 Total project cost based on 1980 price was estimated
at US 8 18.12-million (YD million 6.25) of which US $
million 8.0 (YDm illion 2.76) as credit under standard
IDA ter=m and US 3 6.0 million (YD million 2.07) as loan
under standard IF-ID terms.



_9-
The IDA Credit were allocated to finance 45Y50 of civil
works, including extension centers and stores, feeder
roads and civil works of the refabircated houses, 35% of
spate inprovenent and ereosion control works, 80c/o  of all
imported equipment, 100% on farm inputs and 100t  of technical
assistance and stiff training. The IFAD loan was allocated
to finance 30% of civil works 65Yo of spate improvements and
erosion central works, 204 of all imported equipme!^ts and
materials, 80% of salaries of extension and experimqntal farm
staff, and 100% of the medium term credit for on-farm works,
and orchard establishment.
2.14 Two hundred thousands ust 200,000) were allocated for
local procured items and US$ 1,200,000 unallocated of which
800,000 under IDA credit and 490,000 under the IFAD loan.
2.15 The government was to finance US3 3.9 million equivalent
to the local cost which represent 22% of the total cost.
And 1% of the total cost will be financed by the project
beneficiaries (equivalent to US$ 0.20 million) equivalent.
The remaining local cost of US 1.8 million of the total
cost together with foreign exchange costs of USS 4.2
million equivalent which is 34% of the project foreign
costs or 23% of the total cost of project would be provided
by the IPAD loan. The IDA credit of US$ 8.0 million
equivalent on standard terms would, finance 66% of the
project foreign costs or about 44% of total cost.
2.16 The government was to channel the allocations for farm
inputs, on-farm works, orchard establishment and machinery
for MRS to the beneficiaries through UBY which repays in
12 year tine including two year of grace period at 3%
interest per annm.
2.17 Farm inputs cooperatives and state farms were to repay
the short term sub-loan at e '4 per annum rate of interest



-10-
with repaynt period of one year. Individual farmers
will pay 8% per anum rate of interest. MRS for purchase
of equipments and state farms and cooperatives for on-farm
works pumping equipments, and orchard establishment to
repay medium term sub-loan in 7 years at 5.5% per anqum
rate of interest. Individual farmers for similar activities
but at 7.5% per mnnum rate of interest.
Benefits:
2.18 The project would directly benefit an estimated 820
cooperative and 3.3000 individual farmers, state farms
employers, and several hundred farmers whose income depends
on spate irrigation and live stock production. Thus an
estimated of about 5,000 family would thus benefit directly.
Indirect benefit.would be received by most of the remaining
15,000 inhabitants through increases available of vegetable,
fruits, meat and through bettdr access to markets and
social administrative services as a result of feeder roads.
2.19 Return to family labour would increase by 85% in Wadi
Ain over a period of five years, while with on-farm works
and orchards development in Wladi Beihan the increases would
be 125% in 11 years. Costing family labour under prevailing
market rate for hired labour, the increased in net farm
income would rsnge fron 150, to 250%, which is derived
from increased production resulting from extension services,
land and irrigation improvement, input use and orchard
development in Wadi Beihan area, and from extension service
and input use in Wadi Ain.
2.20 The economic rate of return (ERR) to all project costs,
excluding the feeder roads, erosion control and animal
health and hydrometeorological components which amount to
17% Of total poject costs was estimated at 24%.



_-11 -
ERR would drop below 12% if response of expected on-farm
or production reach less than 75% of the projected level.
III IKPIEENTATION
Effectiveaess, Startup and Technical Assistance with PAO:
3.01 Conditions of effectivness of the Development Credit
Agreement with IDA were the sigving of the loan agreement
with the other externeZ source in this case it was IFAD,
establishment of the E-'J by the govermnent, and entering
by the government into a subsidiary loan agreement. All
these conditions were fulfilled legally by the 23rd of March
1982.
3.02 Start-up following the effectiveless date was slow in
the first one-and half years because of delays in recrui-
tment of the expatriate experts, and the unavailability
of a qualified local staff on the other hand.
3.03 On February 9, 1982 a technical assistance agreement
under a funds in trust arrangement between the PDRY and PAO
was signed under UTPN/PDRY/006/PDY at an estimated cost of
US$ 1.8 million. The actual start of the project was in
July 1982 with the arrival of the first PAO technical field
staff. Duration of the agreement was estimated at 4W years.
Under the agreement PAO will arrange professional services
by appointing a Chief Technical Advisor/ Senior Agrigultural
Advisor, an Irrigation Engineer, an hydrogeologist, an
Agricultural Stension Specialist and a Part-time Credit
Specialist. In addition PAO will provide technical back-
stopping and participate on technical evaluation missions
requested by the governuent, IDA, and IFAD. On the request
of the PDRY government the technical assistance agreenent
was ammended to accommodate the creation of a post for an
irrigation design engineer and a UNV Chief surveyor for two



_12-
$ears as well as a fellowship training programme and other
modifications relating to equipment and materials. The
mnended budget brought the estmated costs up to USI 2.55
million. The amendment was signed on April, 30, 1985.
3.04 In addition to the FA.Q expatriate staff an expatriate
surveyor, civil engineer and a mechanic were employed
directly by the government for a period ranging from 1 to
2.5 years.  But in view of whe difficulty of living cond-
itions, and remoteness of tfie project area, (duty station)
a steady team of four experts and their counterparts
were maintained only on early 1983. For sane reasons, the
project manager and a fresh three gxaduate counterpart
extensionists, a counterpart hydrotiologist, and a counter-
part civil engineer were the only local technical staff
upto March.1983, bst the situation has improved by the
arrival of local surveyors and other technical staff. The
project gathered moneatum by eably 1984 and the pr"gran
towards achieving project objectives was later sustained.
extension of the completion date to 31/12/1988 was
attributed to the slow start up.
Revisions:
3.05 The credit and loan were amended twice and there
were major changes made on project scope and design during
implementation. The number of the extension centers was
reduced from 15 to 10 centers mainly to reduce after the
project operation of these centers and because, too, ths
10 centers were believed to be suffieient to cover BWthan
district. The length of feeder roads was reduced to meet
req"irements determined on the basis of design survey, and
the specification of the road were changed from a gravel
road, to one layer asphalted surface road to reduce main-
tenance and prevent sand dune accumulation on it. The
project headquarters were built in Nuqub instead of Al-
Ulya, the capital town of Beihan district because Nuqub is
centered in the project area of the activities. The well



13 -
deepening and lining component of 88 open wells, was
dropped because of more than anticipated depletion in
water table. For improving water conveyance efficiencyt
the water courses in farmers' land, originally plannoe to
be retained and lined with concrete, were changed to low
pressure burried PVC pipe system. Spate irrigation works
substantially exceeded appraisal estimates due -mainly to
constructing or improving some 16 km length of main canals
beyond the scope of the project. Erosion control works,
originally planned  to be two large schemes, and six medium
schenes, were changed to several tenths of structures, to
accommodate the new situation created by the devastating
floods of 1982. The project did not attempt to provide
seed potatoes dwo to problems encountered in their seasonal
provision by the official govern=ent outlets. The training
of project staff abroad was managed by FP0 within the Trust
rnod tgreement with the PDRY governnent. The nmber of
tractors for MRS was reduced from 15 to 7 to meet the present
need* for MRS, where more private tractors were intro-
duced to the area since the appraisal in 1981.
The number of expatriate experts was increased
by two, a design engineer, and a. chief surveyor, to meet
the requirement of on-farm imprcvement works realised at
the time.
Number and surface area of the prefabricated
building was increased from 12 buildings with 1200 m2 to
23 units with 1620 m2 to accomodate more personnel than
what was appraised.
The credit and loan funds were re-allocated
twice to meet the changes in scope and design of the
proJect. Cost over run for all the civil works was funded
by the government.



_14-
The BPU came under the supervision of the Departnint
of Irrigation, MAAR, due to the realisation that the
majority of-the project works are of engineering nature.
The findings of the study on prices of agricultural
products, which were carried out by the British Consultant
firm - ULG - under IDA credit 768 - YDR, Wadi Tuban Project
were never implemented due to unreliability of the study.
The review and implementationeof the pricing were referred
to into Project DCA 1145 - YDfR Article IV Section 4.10.
Fhnical Progress:
Establishment of BPU
3.06 The project implementation started in July, 1982. It
was not possible until early 1984 to establish a full stable
technical and administrative team. The BPU was headed by the
project manager who is assisted by a CTA and the reit of
the technical staff. The BPU encounted several obstacles
in the first two to three years, Lack of transportati'a
proper housing, comaunications, shortage of experienced
national and international staff, account team were repl-
aced three times through project life.
3.07 In the case of the expatriate experts staff their
posts have not always been manned. The turnover among
them shown in appendix (1) their posts were vacant for
almost 34 months . (Table 36 )
Construction of the prefabricated buildings was a relieve
to all staff and it does improve the works of BEJ. The BPU
divided into several sections they are :
1. Agricultra
2. Agricultural Extension



-m15.- 
3. Water Resources
4. Adminiltration
5. Account
6. Procurement and distribution.
Each of the technical sections have one or more of the
expatriate staff. The services of these expatriates
were terminated end of 1987. The remaining works in
whole of 1988 were carried out, then by their national
counterparts.
Staff training:
3.08 So far 135 man-month (zm) of overseas training were
utilized' since the start of the project at a cost of
US 3 160,000. The training received was in extension
(75mm), irrigation (24=m), Cooperative administration
and planning (18.5=m), Project Managenent (3 mm),
hydrology (12 mm) and machine maintenance (6m=).
One fell --, still to complete his training in hyd-
rology (3mm) at a total cost of about US 3 31,000.
This will make total training 135 mm costing US j 191000
which are almost met and was appraised. 48 staff members
trained had a positive impact on project works. (table 2)
About 200 mm have been spent on local training. The
training mDstly Nas intensive and frequent for extension
staff which resulted in their better comprehension of
extension philosophy and operation.
Out of the 2bo mm, 36 mm were spent to train on
irrigation techniciaP in the irrigation institute - the
one and only from the project area.



-16-
.Another 36 ma were spent to partly trsin in agri-
cultural engineering, from the project area at college
of agriculture, Aden University. Training were also
made in HydrometrogoloQcl problems for a 2 mm. (Table 3)
Throughout the project life the permanent project
manag6r paid several visits to IDA, IFSD and PF1O, to fam-
iliarize himself with their divisions and their operations.
He also attended a project implementation workshop org-
anized by IFAD at Riyadh - Saudi Arabia.
Buildings:
3.09 An office building of       I 18 houses of various
sizes, mess dining room, power house, a gate lodge and a
fuel station were constructed from prefabricated materials
compl:ta dith furniture and utensils, electricity and
water.
They have their own electricity, water and sewage
disposal system. They were handed over to the project
in January 1985. They served as project headquarters.
the Construction cost at appraisal was estimated at
YD 452,000 against an actual cost of YD 561,000 rep-
resenting a cost overrun of YD 109,000 or 24%. Increased
cost was mainly attributed to that the scope of work was
larger than appraised.
3.10 Ten extension centers and three stores for farm
inputs were constructed. The centers provided local
points to dissiminated extension messages throughout
the Beihan district. (Table 4)
The stores eased the rapid distribution of farm
inputs. An agreement was reached in 1985 with the local
construction coraoration of Shabwa (LCC), an affiliate
of the Ministry of Construction, the work was completed
in Septemher 1986.



_17 
The total cost of the centers and stores was
!D:331,185 agaitot the appraisal estimate of XD 276,3000
which represezts a cost overrua of YD 54,885 or 19%.
They were furnishad and supplied with water and elec-
tricity from village network or nei-bbouring farmers
houses. Because of the scatterness of the nenters and
stores, no private contractors accept to construct then
hence, LCC, had no compettors.
laput Suplies:
3.11 Total quantities of fertilizer-and plant chemicals
distributed or sold to farners were 800 tons, of which
tons of urea and TSP, and 5269 liters and 2849 kg. of
various plant chemicals respectively. This anount includes
what w*as used for demonstration purposes by the extension
service and what was given to the cooperatives and state
farms on short term credit basis. Other farm inputs
supplied by the project throughout 1982 to 1988 include
-189 tons of HV  wheat seed, and 8624 kg of vegetable
seeds. Beside that 100 knapsack sprayers were given
as STC, and 30 wheelbarrow types were given free of
charge to cooperative and state farms.
3.12 The use of fertilizers and plant chemicals in the
project area increased steadily from negligeble quan-
tities before the jroject to 800 tons by 1988. Parmers
tend to put more fertilizers to vegetable crops at the
expense of other crops because these crops give hi*her
incentive. Pertilizers and plant chemicals were becoming
conventional in the project area, therefore on the
initiative of the project management the PASC opened a
small branch in Nuqub in October 1986. This branch is
expandin  its business. It started with DY 1,179 in
1986 and YD 17,175 were sold in 1988. The items sold
by this branch include fertilizers, plant protection
chemicals, vegetable seeds and portable sprayers.



_18-
Because the quantities of fertilizers by the project area
.ware smalj (i.e. 800 tons) the project, with *DA approval
procured/locally  through PASC.
Erosion Control:
3.13  As a result of the devastating March 1982 floods,
the project management gave this activity a greater
priority. Works started at the most vulnerable places
i.e. Garaga and Ruda villages, along the Wadi Bank at
Al-Ulye, Wasiah, and nuqub villages. Works for Wadi
Bank protection were concentratod in Wadi Nahr where the
gabion spurs constructed at upper most part at Al-Khura
village and down to the confluence of Wadis Nahar and
Khir.  In Wadi Ehir the density of spurs was much less
than at Wadi Nahr, Due t -:e fact that Wadi Khir was
less damaged than Wadi Sahr. Between the confluence
of the two Wadis down to Badr Canal some scattered gabion
spurs were constructed mainly for bank erosion. In the
area between Badr canal down to Nuqub village a reason-
ably spaced gabions spurs were constructed. Last portion
of the Wdadi protected was the area almost 4 km down
stream of Nuqub. Beyond t#is sigment the spate flows are
less frequent. Even though the project reached the
targeted amounts of gabions works, the need for more
works was still existing. Therefore project manageaent
entourage its engineers to promote the traditional
structures, where sone engineering principals and farmers
oldage experience were married into one hand. On the
other hand farmers becane more dependent on the project
and its gabion structures and thus started neglecting their
oldage traditional dry masonary structures. Works basically
was shared between the project and farmers beneficiaring
fron the work. Works of this kind were carried out in Wadis
Bhir, Nahr and the middle part of Wadi Beihan. One
reinforced concrete structure was constructed in the lower
part of Wadi Beihan. Three pl.anned structures were frozen



-19_
by farmers due to high cost envolved from their side.
In general total works carri.d out were 31,00OM  of
gabion boxes and mattresses in 126 structures and 49000m3
of dry masonary in 23 traditional structures (table 5).
Most of the structures withstand successfully the above
normal 1987 floods. Routine suprs lamages were observed
in the upper Wadi Nahr where the water rolled large bou'ders
but damage was not serious.
Spate Irritation improvement Works:
3.14 To carry out spate irrigation works, the project has
provided for three bulldozers, three tipper trucks, each of
12 ton capacity, and one front wheel loader, and 2000aM of
gabion as estimated at appraisal.  However, the heavy equi-
pments were used also for erosion oontrol works created by
the 1982 devastating floods, at first the danages to Nuqub
weir were rehabilitated and the gabion protection structure
was reconstructed. Later the Tinma canal were excavated
for a 2.8km length, and a 50 ha in.filteration basin was
constructed of a compacted earth. Finally a five sluice
gates were erected at the end of the canal to divert the
spate flow to the Tinna state farm, the infilteration basin,
and the private f't's.  These works, nade it   possible to
utilize the Nuqub weir which were never been in use since
it was constructed in 1965. After Nuqub weir the Bader
canal of 50 ha command area in the middle of 'he Wadi
was rehabilitated for 3.8 km length. Lat#r works involvwd
the upper Wadi especially in Wadi Nahr where spate flows
are more frequent. There were eleven canals of a total
of 600 ha command area and a total length of 26 km were
improved i.e. two canals were linked together aftet
their intakes were reconstructed and protected. Total



-20-
works in Wadi Nahr were about 68,000 nr of earth works,
and 34QO m3of gabion and dry masonary. In wadi Dhir
there were four canals improved. In middle wadi; five
canals and fifteen in lower wadi. Works were extended
to Wadi Ain upon request of the M-ILR, and the two major
canals were benefitted. (Table 6) shows details of
all the works. The total number of works executed
were 730,000 m3 of earth, 5300 O of gabions and
dry masonary work -'% and erosion ocn*rol works  as
carpared to 270,000 mv of earth and 2000 M3 of gabions
and benefitting about 175 'ha in Wadi Beihan and 760 ha
in Wadi Ain. The works exticuted exceeds appraisaXT
esti4ate which was envisaged due to the constructivn
or rehabilitation of many canals/f l IOope of the
project. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that to the
upper and middle wadi where spate flows are more
frequent the area benetitted is 1100 ha. The project
has to request assistance from the MRS which iq rec-
eived.
Feeder Roads:
3.15 The survey and design were made by the Road
Authority of Ministry of Contraction in Auagust, 1984.
It took the project, Ministry of Contrstction and IDA
almost one year to agree upon final design, specs and
cost. The agreement for constructing the roads was
signed on 4th January, 1986 with the Public Corporation
for Road Construction of Ministry of Construction. With
15 km length of one layer of asphalt and 2 4 km earth
compacted branch roads. Supervision of construction of
the road after IDA approval was made by a resident
engineer from Ministry of Construction fto. During
construction some changes were made i.e. increasing
number of drainage structures and caacelling two branch
roads to two small villages and were compensated by
making the two remaining branch roads into an asphalted
one. Construction was started on Aprlt 1986 and cop-.
leted by April 1987. Spate flows occured on mid -



_21-
April 1987 caused some damages. Final constructed length
was 15.5 km i.e. 14.7 nain alignnent and o.a km branch
roads and all were asphalted. The road linked several
heavily populated villages i.e. Nuqub, Addimah, Alhinah,
Ausykan .......... and Zubyban. Despite some of the
defects which will be cckrected soon by Ministry of
Construction, no maintenance problems exist yet.
on Farm Improvement Works:
3.16 The scope and design works for improving water
conveyance from wells were changed to the low pressure
burried PVC pipe system.  Works were started on May 1985
after the instalment of pipes and an excavator were
procured. Three more installments were also procured and
a second heavier excavator was made available by project
management in lieu of a water tanker. Later in 1988 the
M4AAR arranged for a 3rd excavator to join the project to
expedite implementation. Total hectrage implementad is
1100 ha which is in excess of 150 ha of appraisal target.
Table (7) shows the pattern of beneficiaries from this
system. The work for demonstration purposes, was
extended to Wadi Ain. Total cost of these works was
Y D 700,000 compared to Y D 727000 during appraisal.
Land levelling in the other hand, has been delayed
at the beginning' due to some technical and expertise
reasons. But that uR4 farmers complained that land
levelling will destroy top soil and may damage the borders
of their plots within the same farm which will lead to
less attraction to land levelling. Total hecterage
implementedwere 250 ha which is only 26% of appraisal
target. Most of the area is on state farms. The"cost
of the works was YD 40,000 compared to !D 106,000 at
appraisal.

Well Improvement:
3.17 The Project provided 30 pumping sets and were sold
to farmers on MTC through their cooperatives. Their coat
was YD 62000 compared to YD 169500 at appraisal.
Equivment for MRS:
3.18 Based on the request of the MRS, early in 1983, the
project provided seven tractors with tipping trailers,
front loaders, seeddrills, dis-harrow, tine harrows and
level blades and a mobile workshop. Except the front
loaders and seeddrills all equipments were handed to
MRS and they are functioning well. The cost of these
were XD: 76585 compared to estimated YD 164500 at
appraisal. All these equipments were sold to MMS
through MTO, however, so far the MTC agreenents between
MRS and NBY was not signed.Tn 1988 the project, from its
local funds provided two combine harvesters to MES, free
of charge.
Orchard Establishments:
3.19 The devastating floods of 1982 was followed by a
serious drought period for almost three years, (May 1983
to April 1986) and created unexpected barrier in the face
of extending the orchard in the project area.
The root stocks were partially raised or crfted
at the project nursery or brought from Lodar ursery,
Ho wwrer . the new plants were sold to farmers at a
nominal price (0.5 ID/plant). The nmober of plants
distributed were 15,000 of oranges, of leDo and papaya
making a total area of orchar 110 ha which is about 50%
of the appraisal target which is attributed to the drought,
shift of farmers to grow new cash crops and possibly that
the appraisal target was unrealistic



-23-
Nurserp 2Xtablishnent:
3.20 A nursery of almost 1.0 ha was established at the
project headquarters at Nuqub, equipped with technicians,
labourer and about 50,000 plastic bags. The nursery was
used to raise fruit seedlr,.s and for grafting purposes
on root stocks which were raised on site or .bought from
Lodar nursery. Part of the nursery was a shed of 10 x 10m2
area made of galvanized pipes *4" and netting shed. The
total number of plants established at the nursery were
9000 of oranges and papaya and 1000 of windbrakers and.
ornamental plants.
Along with the orange seedlings distributed by the
nursery a private farmer in Wadi Ain also distributed
about five hundred plants of orange annually, during
1983 - 1988 period.
&Perinental Farms:.
3.21 New irrigation techniques, improved agronomic
practices and introduction of new crops have been
demonstrated on the 15 ha experimental far at Timma.
Before this could take place, the farm had to be
reshaped which.involved moving of 12000nd of earth to
-c.^¢onstruct a road, installation of 350 meters of 6 inch
PVC pipe- .wth 4 inchh9intsand installation of a
sprinkler irrigation unit on 1.0 ha area of the farm.
Due to circumstances beyond control the drip irrigation
system did not arrive until Novenber 1987. The system
(based on decision made by (coc) was installed at the
Usylan state farm under supervision of the project in
1988. The farm is staffed by a research officer and
two research assistnts, labourers and one vehicle.
The main works conducted at the farm are varietal
testing, test agronmic studies and irrigation methods
The works are carried out by the project staff, or in

Evdrometeorological luvestigations:
3.22 The project established three weather stations,
ten rainfall recorders, and six river gauue recording
stations,   compared  to one, four, and three respec-
tively, at appraisal (Table, 9a 9b , the recording of
metreological data started from 1983, ground water
levels and salinity values have been recorded from 151
selected wells in the area. Surface waterflow in the
Wiadis could be recorded since June 1986, before that
all records were classified according to the extents
that they have reached in the Wadi.(Table 9 c).
3.23 The investigations showed that the estimated
annual surface in flow is 45.5M n3 at the heads of
Wadis Nahr and Ehir compared to 38 zp estimated by
SOGUREH in 1978. Aquifr annual nacharge was found to
be 33 M.3m
3.24 The number of agricultural operating wells in
Wadi Heihan area was found to be 8F5 wells compared to
500 at appraisal (Table 9 D)
3.25 The groundwater salinity was measured by the
observation walls, and was found to be ranging from
200 ppm to 4500 ppm. Generally speaking the salinity
is not a major problem for agricultural production
so far.
3.26 The water balance for the different sectors
of Wadi Beihan was estimated and showed that upper
and lower sectors are extensively over-punped, while
the middle is in a balance condition (table 9 E)



_25 -
3.27 Measurements for average well discharge annual,
pumping rates at 3000 hrs/year were found to be 7 1/s
and 77 wM; respectively. Infilteration rate of spate
floi. was calculated and found to be ranging from
1.05 to 36.87 X r/hr with an average of  8.2M m/hr.
(Table 9H)
3.28 The data collected on hydrogeology of the aquifer,
level and salinity of the groundwater at different
periods, were converted into maps. (Table 10) Throughout
the project implementation the project hydrogeologist
provided technical guidance to farmers for well deepening
and situation for- digging new irrigation wells, never-
theless majority of farmers dug many irrigation wells
without any pernission, therefore the project management
found that it is impossible, due to social and political
reasons,   to implement the project convenant as out-
lined in the DCA article 4, sections 4.Oa (a) and 4.09(b)
which indicate that the project hydrogeologist shall
examine proposals to construct each enew irrigation
well and report to NAAR and IDA on its likely effect on
the equifer.
3.29 The project for the sake of updating the math-.
ematical model prepared by SOGRELH to predicting the
future of the aquifer, drilled three test boreholes in
North-west of I uqub in 1987 to determine the bound-
aries of the acquifer. Unfortunately due to unavail-
ability of computer facilities, time and probably need
experience, it was not possible to run the model.
Throughout the project implementation a serious drought
period took place from May 1983 upto June 1986, combined
with continuous digging of new irrigation wells caused
a gradual lowering of the water table.



-26-
The over-pumping and its consequences were brought
to the attention of the authorities on several occasions.
In response to this approach, the local authorities
decided tot to issue licences ary more for digging new
irrigation wells and none were reported dridnc 1987 and
1988.
ATricultural Extension:
3.30 The agricultural extension was the first stable
unit established at"the early stases of the project.
It's services started sathering Momentu= in the begin-
ning of 1983. It was equip-ed sufficient staff and
necessary supplies. Throughout the proJect life it
was strengthened by training of the extension officers
and agents.    It's the firstof its kind in Beihan
and its activities covered conducting area demonstration
plots, plant Protection campaignes, operating Audio
visial equipments and issuing demonstration phamphlets,
input distribution, crop maturity contification,denonstrate
new implements and machinery, and train farmers. These
activities are outlined below :-
Crop Demonstration Pl.;.ts:-
3.31 A 'Potal of 88 ha in 363 demonstU:ltion plots for
various crops (table 11) were innducted. Use of farm
inputs, and improved agronomic practices i.e. (eswing
On furrows and border strip like plots ) and use of new
machinery and imp&enents.  The results   obtained were
overwhelming and it  has generated the incrensed demand
fOr farm inputs. The plots concerned state farms,
cooperative and individual parmers fields.



27 -
Plant Protection:
3.32 The project provided plant chemicals, tractor
msuhted and knaps sprayers to launch may be, the first
plant protection campaign in the project area.  During
2983 and 1984 the chemicals were given free of charge
to all farmers.  After the great inpact created by the
resilts  -t these canpaignes and the training of the
extension agents, a new approach was established
(i.e. farmers since 1985 buy the plant chemical acc-
ording to the advice of the extension agent in his
area but still using the project machinery. The total
area served by the extension staff only is shown in
table (12) since then farmers learn about various
diseases and their treatment and they become al6rt to
any slight infection to their crops. The p-loject
provided the farming community 120 knapse., and 30
wheelbarrow type sprayers.
Audio Visual Equipments:
3.33 The project, provided, video cameras, TV set,
one over head and one &lide projector and several
things to help train and demonstrate to farmers,
improved agronomic practices, and use of several
video films, hundreds of pictures, and thousands
of copies of phamphlets for various crops were
produced by the extension sertices.
input Distribution:
3.34 The project provided one 5 tons truck to transport
and distribute farm inputs. Later every cooperative
and state farm were given their requirements and was
transported to their stores. Individual farmers get
their needs either from the closest cooperative store
or from the project headquarters. The extension staff



- 28 -
in this regard was the body which estinated the
requirements of each cooperative or stat farm.
Crop maturity cetification:
3.35 To reduce the storage losses of the marketed
onions, and potatoes and garlic later. The extension
staff, based on request by PCMPC, certify on the
maturity and marketability of the said crops. The
several PCMFV marketing (i.e. receiving centers did
not receive the produce without the extension certi-
fication.
Agricultural Machinery and implements:
3.36 For the purpose of the extension Activities, the
project provided several machinery and implements i.e.
5 riddgers, 5 border discs, 3 MF tractors with chisel
plough etc.,   3 potatoe diggers for harvesting of
potatoe and  oni"ns, spraying machines of severtl types,
moto* cycles etc., (Table 13 list of equipment) The
p-tatoe diggers was the most attracting and except for
the electrical generators, most of the appraisal es-
timates were net.
VeterinarY Services :
3.37 VeteitAary services was regarded as part of the
*xtensioa body. The project for this purpose established
a small veterinary center since 1983, and equiped with
iedicines, tools and a veterinary assistant. This center
had, unfortunately, constant problem of the shortage of
national staff probably due to remotness of the project
area and scarsity of veterinary assistants. The extension
service has assisted the veterinary section in va¢-
cination campaigns, about 12,000 sheep and goats, and



- 29 -
few hundreds camels have been vacinated. In addition
about 2,000 heads of livestock have been provided
medical treatment under the project.   No activities on
improved animal nutrition were possible because of
intermittent vacancy in the post of the veterinary
assistant.
Farmers Traininv-:
3.38 Extension staff: National and international have
-articipated effectively in training farmers on use of
plant chemicals, seed treat_nents, use of sprayers,
application of fertilizers, and crop  diseases.  Training
involved several 3-4 days courses on potatoe production
crop production in general, onion production..etc.,
Besides that extension officer and. extension agents paid
about 6000 visits to farmers field, held about 35 9eeting
with them (table 14).
Procurements :
3.39 Prefabricated offices and houses, equi;"ents and
materials for the extension and BPU, spate irrigation
improvement works and erosion control works, input
distribution, MRS, and on-farm irrigation improvement
works were procured through international shopping on
the basis of comparing of not less than three price
quotations. All farm inputs dere procured locally
through PASO. Extension centers an', stores were con-
tracted locally to LCS of Shabwa. Feeder roads were
contracted locally, to PCRC both affliates of MOC.
:rilling of the three test boreholes was contracted
locally to PDC. Construction of Nurscry, experimental
farm and on-farm irrigation improvement works are imp-
lemented   directly by the project.  Spate irrigation



-030-
inprovement and erosion control works were carried out
by the project through force account. Technical
assistance experts were provided for agreement in
trust with FAQ (table 13)
Agricultural Credits:
3.40 The cost of STC and YITC activities, implemented
by the proJect and channelled through the subsid!ry
loan agreement with NEBY, to the beneficel?,s was
YD 578,000 cowpated to YD 1,240,000 estimated at appr-
aisal. This is nainly due to lower cost of some goods,
i.e. Bertilizers, and pumj.ing equipments, some goodq
were not provided by the project, but by other govermnent
outlets (i.e. seed potatoe and other vegetable seeds).
Or sone components were -artially implemented (i.e.orchards
establishment and land levelling and costs of sone qom-
ponents were charged to lo6al expenditures instead of MTC
(i.e. seedlings and well deepening was cancelled.
(table 15) The allocations for sTC and MTC, were amended
in the DCA accordingly.
All activities of BTC and MTC which cost about YD500,000
were covered by credit agreements between NBY and
beneficiaries. The repayments cf the installments is
proceedinrg well. (table 16),The outstanding amount which
is YD 78,000 which cover the cost of machinery for MRS,
still not covered by agreement due to   some reservation
by MR8. About eight individual farmers benetitted from
on-farm works after they have been granted by their
neighbouring cooperative. The beneficiaries from the
STO and MTC are state farms, cooveratives and individual
farners in the 'Project ar..a.

Total Project Costs and Credit and Loan Disbursement:
3.14 Tctal project cost increased, in view of remotness of
the area and increased scope of the work and improved
thedfvignaf the feeder road, from YD 6.250,OCO to 6,670,0C0,
with cost over-rtn YD 420,000 met by government contribution
the total net government contribution increased from
YD 1,400,000 at ap,.raisal to YD 1,870,00 actual. IDA and
IF4D f mds were the sane as forseen at apl;raisal and were
spent totally. Nevertheless the percentage out of the total
project cost at appraisal varied greatly from those at
completion i.e. project management from 25.9% to 39% ,
agricultural extension from 16.1% to 13.4, farm inputs
from 7.6% to 1.5%, spate irrigation and erosion control
works from 19.4% to 19.1%  on-farm irrigation works from
18.3% to 12%, equipments Irom .7% to 1.3%, feeder roads
from 8.7% 11.8% and HFychometreolo4ical observations from

IMPLEM TATION SCHEDULE:
3.42 The   construction of office and staff housing,
extension centre and stores was little behind schedule
but each took a period of 18 months compared to 24
scheduled. Nursery and experinental firm works were
much in advance of schedule and. it took 12 months
compared to 30 months scheduled.  Construction of
erosion control structures started early. While in
case of spate irrigation i=,rovenents was close to
schedule but for both activities it took 65 months
compared to 45 months scheduled. Construction of
feeder roads was much behind schedule but its
construction period took 14 months compared to 27
months months scheduled. Construction of on-farms
works, was much behind schedule but construction
period was close to schedule. Procurement of
equipments was close to schedule bht for materials,
i.e. for on-farm works, it was bahind schedule. For
farm inputs, procurement was made close  to schedule
but it was prclonaed and took 30 months compared to
a cumulative 16 months.  n

3.43 Throughout the project implementation, the Project
Unit maintained records of all inputs furnished to the
farmers, with their production costs, prices received,
and crop yields obtained. The project unit also
prepared the progress quarterly reports to the tgover-
nment with copies to IDA. During the first three years
they were not issued regularly, reflecting serious
problens that faced the project. While the CTA post
becane vacant, the project manager prepared these
reports on several occasions.



-33 -
3.44 Auditing of the project accounts was not possible
until 1984 and from then onward the audit became reg-
ular. The audit covered local IDA credit, IFAD funds
and short and medium term credits.
3.45 Monitoring of the aquifer and controlling its
fur+4her exploitation to guard against its irreversible
depletion was of a major concern to the project mana-
gement.  For this purpose, all elements for the moni-
toring were collected. but it was not p,ssible to stop
the :...loitation of the aquifer without water
legislation.
3.46 The project annual plans were approved by the
central coordinating committee (CCC)   It held four
meetings from 1982 to 1985 and eight meetings from
1986 to 1988.
3.47 Beside the progress report the various technical
divizions of the   project product.a several reportsj
These are listed in(Table 35).
Operation and Maintenance:
3.48 In compliance with section 5.03 and 5.04 of
article V of the  DCA the government has established
a branch of PASC at Nuqub in the p,roject area in Sep-
tember 1986 to ensure the suplly of farrn inputs after
the project. This branch is ex;andiin, its activities
gre
gradually.  In Sept.-Dec. 1986 its sales were YD 1179.37,
in 1987 YD 6597.915 and in 1988 it was YD 17175.029.
Items sold were pesticides, vegetables seeds, plant
cheiicals and knapsach sprayers (Table ).



3.49 As reg,ards spate irrigation and errosion'control
works, the government has maintained since 1/1/198 a
small maintenance unit composed of 11 enployees which
are adequate with sufficient resources to cope with
routine annual maintenance requirements.
3.$0 In the case of the feeder roads, they were built
of asphalt mainly to red1uce their maintenance needs.
They will be handed over to the Public Works Depart-
ment.
3.51 For the Extension Services and monitoring of
surface and groundwater resources, the Gvernment,since
1988, had maintained sufficient staff and resources
to carry out operation and monitoring activities
after project completion.  Their works will be super-
vised by the provincial director of agriculture, bwu
* the technical backstoppinC will be provided by-the
Department of Extension and Irrigation of NAIR, resp-
ectively.
3.52 The estimated annual requirements of the agri-
cultural sector in the project area is outlined in
table (37). Its provision will keep the monentqn
of development going on acnd preserve the new tech-
niques learned and practiced by the farmers during the
implementation of the project.
Prolect Covenants:
3.53 Most of the project ecvenants were falfilled.
But the project had suffered from lack of qualified
accounting staff until 19C6. !Nevektheless situation
has improved but it still could be better.(Table 21)
sunmarizes the status of all covenants.

3v AGRICULTURAL IMWACT
1tonitoring
4.01 As the project did not include a monitoring
component, and because the individual farmers are
making at least 50%/ of cultivated areas, the project
for the assessment of its agricultural impact depends
on data from  PCMFTV annual roports for the marketed
vegetable crops i.e. onions,potatoe and garlic, data
an actual production and yields from state farms,
and a survey launched by the extension staff in
1967/1988 to survey openjiting wells, cropped areas
of each crop. Yields/potatoe was related to areas
which was limited by amounts of seed potatoe. For
cereals, alfalfa, and sesame, its yields were esti-
mated through interviewing farmers on previous crop
and judged by crop figure for standing crops.
4.02 Appraisal estimates for yields  increases  with
Phe project for all crops, in TOa/ha table (22) shows
the situation. Cropped areas at 1987/1988 seasons
per sector is in table (23)
4.03 The appraisal report allowed for a decrease in
cropped areas, nevertheless there were over 200 wells
dug after the appraisal, the cropped areas decreased
wisich neans that the cropped area per well has become
smaller, or t4e appraisal figures were over estimated.
As it was eivisaged in the appraisal report a shift
towards higher value crops had accured. Areas of
sesame was reduced but drastically. Areas of ETN



- 36 -
and losal wheat, and barley more or less remained the same,
and shift to HYV wheat was only <bout 25% of appraisal
expectations. (Table 22) It is to be noted that the inc-
rease in area of b.arley, and decrease in areas of sesame
could indicata either a change in the apetite of lower
Wadi population tCowards barley, which was not practiced
before and cultivation of onions in su=imer on uhe expence
of sesame, on a slight indicator to ground water salinity.
4.04 The overall changes in cropping pattern is shown in
table (24), and indicate that are.s of vegetables, alfalfa
and citrus has increased on she expense of areas of
cererals and seseme.
Production:
4.05 The total production of the project area has increased
almost three times. While the production of onions and
garlic has surpassed the appraisal expectations (i.e.from
1,500 tons to 5,9CC tons. The potatoes was 50% short.
because the areas of tl;e two state farms arn too small to
the cooperative and individual farmers sector, no signi.ficange
differences in yields were assumed. Yields and total
production wcre showm in tabla (22). As it was expected at
appraisal the area will produce sufficient cereals (5900 tons)
and vegetables for the 54,C'r.  population of the project area.
From table (30), it can be seen clearly that yield increment
of onions and potatoes ,s an indicator for the rest of crops,
w3s due to project activities, and prices have not changed
uitil 19e7.
4.&6 Yield increases aro d-asc  o (>) use  of fertilizers and
pesticide3  (b)  activities of the newly established
extension service, and (c) availability of irrigation water
due to the pvc pipes network installed on about 1100 ha of
cultivated areas, and (d) availability of spate water to
many cultivated areas, too due to state irrigation impro-
vement works.



-37-
Value of Production:
4.07 The valuo of crop 2roduction for the project
area using both econonic pr4.ces (EP) and financial
prices (?P) has i-ncreasedc' frco YD 2,0n2,000 and
ID 2,775,000 at appraisal to YD 7,321,000 and
YD 6,660,000 at completion.  '-.tal crop production
has increased from 34.00(e tCns to 100,000 tons.
As it wa1 expected at a_%raisal the total crop
production was dominated by the green alfalfa thus
its BP and FP were ketst at YD 40 / ton. (table 25)
(U? and F? are shown in table (26)
*iechanisation:
4,03 With the agricultulral equiprents which we made
available by the project it  8as possible for the
first time to harvest sizable areas of potatoe and
onions mechanically. Ridgers were used to make
furrows for onion cultivation, seed drills used to
sow large spated areas., andl wheat in state farms
and some coo-erato and state farms were mechanic-
ally harrested (table 13)
A'inl.r Production:
4.09 The total number of ru'uinants surveyed by the
Central Board of Statistics in the rroaoct area in
1985 was about65,000 heads of runinant animals
i.e. sheep and gcats cor2pared to 5C,000 heads
estimated by SOGREASH in 1979. This indrease in the
nmmber of these anirnals is in proportion to the
increase in area of alfalfa cultivated i.e. 650 ha
in 1988 conpared to 320 ha !.n 1980. In this regard
the veternrity services of the project has snall
contribution  to this i.ncrearent in  .nimal mmber.



-38-
Feeder Roads:
4.10 Traffic on the Feeder Roads amounted to 250
vehicles a day, making transport of goods and people
easier i.e. : Puel consumption reduced, farmers put
more load on these trucks compared without the road
i.e. reducing number of trips to market their crops.
Maintenance of vehicles had been reduced as well.
About 400 students attending village schools have
benefitted from the road too, i.e. tiavelling to and
returninG from school became easier and pleasant.
4.11 The alignment of the feeder rcads caused the
-IOC to realigne the 4th highway project, Waset-Beihan
part II to be integrated with the feeder roads making
a net saving in length and cost of about 4.7 km and
YD:300,000, which was used by MOC to increase or
improve the scope of works of the highway. (see nap 2)
Spate Irrigation Works:
4.12 The estimated hectarage of the spated area in the
project area in the 1987 season was about 5800 ha '
which has never been like that in the past . However
it was about 1500 ha in 1988. ProJect works were
attributed largely to the spreid of spate water throush
the canal intakes, rehabilitation of inprored canals
which Were implemented by the project funds and
equipments.
4.13 The Timan iafilteration basin has an earnous
beneficial effect on the Tinna state farm, wan the
neighbouring cooperatives and individual fargs, wells
which dried up or operated only for less tha two
hours now run at full 4" pipes for alr ,st 10 hours
a day. More crops produced and income increased to their
families. Spate flows rarely reach the desertor.



- 39 -
Erosion Control Works:
4.14 The erosion Control structuLres have protected al=ost
15C0 ha of agricultural lands, and 112 wells. Besides
that aboAt 24 villagos of tota1 2000 dwrellings.  Keeping
more land for agricultLre production and giving a piece
of mind to  several thous.nd of the inha-bitants and
eliminate the fear frcm floods.
4.15 In several spots along the W'adi these structures
while deflicting spa'e flows it also retard it causing
more infilteration to the ground water aqpifer.
On-farm Works:
4.16 The irrigation water course lining with the low
pressure burried PVC pipe system g,tined popularity among
farmers and the  project was not ablb to  cope,at this
stage, with their demands.
4.17 Over the 1100 ha implemented the irrigation labour
was reduced by 2CI/ or 104 man/day per year.  Irrigation
time was roduced by 27%. Farmers have  two more off-days.
fuel consumption reduced by 27% or 4OCO gallons/year.
All these benefits were arised from the saving of at least
25% of the pumped irrigation water by laying the pvc pipes.
(table 7 B shows the water balance of the improv6d wells)
With the prevailing drought and the unexpected dr^wdown of
the groundwater many green areas would be disappearing if
these works were not impleenated.
=Ceeooca  Inesiations:-,
4.18 The situation and the threat of depleting the
aquifer has becone obvious to local authority and
farmers due to continuous warning and reminders to them
bT the project management which was based on the findings

4,19 The investigations have revealed that the spate
hydrograph is ot different nature than the SGGREAH
one i.e. with very sharp peak in short time have a
grdual descending limb. For aquifer recharge purposes
it-is also showed that there is an undergroundwater
water barrier at Haid binAgeel (downstream of Nuqub)
preventing groundwater from flowinG down stream instead,
deflicting the flow to north west direction which
means that it is Of prime im1.ortance that spate flows
rg it reach the area east and downstream Raid bi dgeel
for aquifer recharge.
Another similar fact rev3aled is that In the upper
Wadi Nahr upstream of al-Mahalah there is an underground
barrier across the wadi width making the base flow at
same elevation of the groundwater in that area.
Generally speaking with the hydroneterological investi-
gations it became possible to better understand the
hydrogeology and hychology of the Wadi Beihan area than
any previci;s period. Tables from (9A) to (9H) sunmariza
tk#ss findings of the invwstigatinn.
V ECOTOMIC ANALYSIS
Cost of the Project:
5.01 During the project implementation, from 1982 to
1988, the total cost of the project amounted to
YD 6,600,000 which was actually used in the project area.
5.02 The official exchange rates of SDR to U83 of the
IDA and IPAD averaged to certain years in YD were used
to calculate the project cost at each year. The total
project cost are actually distributed as 39% for

5.04 The cost of production per hector of each crop are
estimated (table 27). The project cost is presented in
tabel (28). Mlue of production in table (25) and
incremental crop production in table (29). The economic
and financial prices are presented in table (26).
Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
5.05 Based on the project performance from 1982 to 1988
the economic rate of return has been calculated for
twenty years started from 1982. Nevertheless the project
impact has started from 1983 as shown in table (30).
Core conservative approach was used which assumed no
benefits during the first four years of the project.
Table (29) presents summary of incremental gross benefits
from crops, icremental on-farm production costs, incre-
nental net benefits, replacement investments, and oper-
ational cost beyond implementation.
5.06 Most of the investments made by the project are
expected to have direct impact on agricultural production.
Unfortunately the cost of feeder roads, erosion control

works, and hydrometecrological observation were assumed
they have no benefit to the agricultural production,
has increased from 17% to 21% table (18) Based on the
iterl presented in table (28) the Econonio rate of return
amounted to 29% compared to 24% estimated at appraisal.
VI INSTITUTIONAL IMPACT
Stregthening of Agricultural institutions in the Project
areas
State Farms:
6.01 The two state farms for the first time since more
than a decade nade a po3itive cash balance i.e. their
total income is more than their total expenditures
including the production cost of all crops. The
management of the two state farms expect this balance
will be more in the season 88/89 than 87/88. The two
state farms were also able to pay the first instalment
of the MIC. This positive effect is attrituted to the
project activities in these two farms i.e. land-levelling,
water course lining with PVC pipes systens prcvision
and use of farm inputs, and mechanisation of cultivation
of potatoe and harvezting potata too, onion and wheat
crops. Also partially due to development of four tube
wells in the area of state farms out of the project
local funds.
The Pour Cooperatives:
6.02 The amount of taxes on farmers products which is
called the cooperative developnent portion, which goes
to the cooperative have increased considerably from
estimated 11,000 YD in 1987 to 82,000 YD in 1988 for
the four cooporatives,(table    ) fue to the increased



-43.-
production of vegetables, fruits and cereals. This
production increases were largely attrubuted to the
project activities: provision and use of farm inputs,
lining water course with PVC pipe system, provision
and distribution of pumping equipment, plant chemicals,
spraying machines, and several cultivation implements
introduced by the project. All the four cooperatives
were able to pay the 1st and 2nd installments of the
HTC for on-farm works andi pumping sets.
The Individual Farmers:
6.03 The revenues from onions, garlic and potatoea
for these farmers has gone up from YD61,000 in 1982
upto ID 226,360 in 1988, (table 31) which indicated that
they immediately benefitted from farm inputs. Table (32)
shows that this sactor has contributed for about 55%
of the total marketed onions, garlic and potatoe through-
out the project life.
National Bank of Yemen (biBY)
6.04 The project, by procuring farm inputs, pumping
equipments, machinery for MRS, and materials for the
I ow pressure burried PVC pipes irrigation system%
have encouraged 1BY to nter into lending the farmers
in new items, whose never dealt with them before. The
arrangements made by the iproject for procurement and
administering the STC and MTC activities  also
encouraged NBY to show keen interest in contimning to
extend loazs to farmers in these items.  The NBY had
agreed in principle to provide for 1989 a MCT of
YD 53,000 for provision of PVC pipe materials for
water course lining to cooperatives in the project
area. Interest will be 3.3 % and repayment in seven
years period.



- 44 -
Machine Rental Station (MRS)
6.05 The services of the MRS had ibnroved in the field
of bulldozers and tractors which mainly attribtted to
the provision by the project of a mobile workshop and
seven tractors with various imp. enents.   The heavy
machinary is quickly repaired and freq:Aently operated.
6.06 The same tractors were used.for ploughing and
transport of stones for valious purposes. Table (33)
shows that tractors operations were YD 3646 in 1985,s
and goes upto YD 19316 in 1986 after the project
handed the seven tractors to MRS. Besides that the
project gives .priority to MRS for hiring bulldozers
and tipping trailors in the project works for impro-
ving spate canals and transporting stones for erosion
control structures which resulted by providing inc-
re4se in scope of activity of the MRS and conseq-
uently causing an extra income. The cost of project
works which were carried out by MRS was amounted to
!D 164,559 (US3 481,167)
Public Agricultural Services Corporation (PASC)
6.07 The increased demand for farm inputs by farmers
due to project extension acti-ities, create a new
area for PASC to expand its business. Eacouragdby
this demand and project management i.nitiatives it
opened a branch in the project area at the project
headquarters on October 1966. Since its opening it
expanded its sales gradually. Since October 1986
upto Dec. 1988 the total quantity sold by the branch
were 40 tons of fertilizers, 227 litre and 2104 kg of
plant chemicals, 3610 kg of onion seeds and 470 kg
of other vegetable sees, and 55 units of knapsack
sprayers.



This will insure the continuation of supplies of all
farm inputs after the closing of the project. (see
table 34)
Public Corporation for Marketinp Fruits and Vegetables (PCMFV)
6.08 At the beginning of the project there was only
one PCtrlT receiving centre, throughout the project life
three more centres were also constructed by PCMFV. The
materials and nan-power for erection of one of these
-centres were provided by the project. Project equi-
pnents provided also for land ozreparation for another
one. The total marketed vesetables were increased
from about 800 tons in 1982 to about 7000 tons by 1988.
(table 30) shows the actuti marketed quantities of
potatoes onions, and garlic through PCMFV branches in
the project area.
The post harvest losses were drastically reduced
due to the involvement of the project extension agents
in certification on maturity and marketability of
vegetable crops. Thus the financial losses of PCMPV
were very much reduced.
Institutions Established under the PPoiect:
6.09 The agricultural extension service assembled by
the project, with two graduates and 10 extension
agents provided with adequate training and all
important facilities, has since the beginning of 1988
been operating independentally from the project. It
is the first such service in Shabwa province.
510 The small, but adequate, unit for monitoring
and evaluation of surface and ground water resources
established by the project and equipped with adequate



-46-
traininG and facilities, has since the beginning of
the year 1988 boen operating indeaendantaly fro: the
project. It is the first such service in Shabwa
province, too.
6.11 The engineering section established during the
project life, which was redSuced since January 1989
to a small maintenance unit, hos gained  experience
in execution of spate irri-ation improvement and
erosion control works, and in desig;ning and laying
PVC pipe, irrigation network. Tkis section in 1988,
with only Haitional staff, implemented 420 ha of PVC
pippes irri,;-ation system which is about 44% of the
project target, and 95,000 m3 of earth works, 247 '3
of dry nasonary and 1600m3 of earth works, 24740
of nasonary and 1606 n3 of gabions and 5 sluice gates
in spate and erosion control-works.(Table 38)
6.12 The national project management with its account
and adninistration staff gained e good experience in
dealing with financers i.e. IDA and IFAD and with PAO,
and they became familiar with their procurement,
disbursement and administrative procedures.
Coordination Between ASenciess
.6.13 Project activities designed in the appraisal to
be through other agencies were carried out as far as
duration, satisfactory with full cooperation of the
concerned agencies namely: MOC and its affliates LOC
of Shabwa and PCRC for construction of extension
centres and stores, and feeder roads, PASC for pro-
curement of farm inputs, AS-  for oonstruction of pre-
fabricated houses and offices, PDC for drilling test
boreholes, El-kod and. S3,s  research centers for



-L47?-
research programs in the sperimental farm and Giar
institute for training of extension agents.
6.14 NBY Cooperation and Coordination  is the most
distinguishable. evmn - th ough the re-lending process
to farmers was not materialised at the beginning due
to lack of guarantees, the NBY allowed the project in
order to sqve time, to procure the naterials and
requirements for the STC and MTC, and to implement
the on-farm inprofement works, and farm inputs..etc,
in order for the project to utilize its resources i.e.
technical staff and machinery. tater beneficiaries
signed agreements with NBY for all the works. This
courage and understanding of NBY, laid the foundation
stone for the relending p2ocess in a new field to
farmers i.e. Laying of PVC pipe irrigation network,
which is now beingriplicated in several new projects
in agriculture.       A
6.15 Cocrdination of the work of the different dep-
artments was through the central coordination comrittee
specified in the appraisal report, which performed
very satisfactory especially from 19C6 and on. The
interest, support and cooperation of the local exec-
utives and partly authorities at the district and
government levels was indespensable for the successfull
operation and conclusion of the project.
6.16 The central government authorities i.e. NAAR and
Ministry of Planning gave full support to the project
as evidence by financing of cost over-run in imple-
nentation which is amounted to YD 4J70000.



48 
6.17 BPUT, with its large team of technical and
adninistrative staff, national and international,
was satisfacterly adequate for the job and worked
as a teen.
6.18 FAO headquarters did not employ its fourty years
of world wide experience in making a complete team
of experts to deal with major project components and/
or to bring some experience of similar works under
some what a sinilar climate or countries to ?DRY
conditions.   Instead it sent exjeerts, where, some
of them have very limited experience with works to
those of the project. For lack of proper experience
and/or limited -.roductivity the FAO explerts have to
be replaced from time to time. The turnover among
then is shown in table (36). Nevertheless some of
them have very good experience and showed high
working standards.
6.1$ The office of the FADO representative in the
country was very cooperative. Through this office
the major telexes and messaGes were exchanged with
the financers and foreign contractors without any
delay.
6.20 Ihe UNDP office in the country acts as a co-
ordinator to all other UN crganisations (i.e. FAO
ILO etc., .Nevertheless with PAO-Government ~rb fmW proJect,
coordinating. nature su_posed to be very thin.
However,, the PAD project experts showed various
degrees, unoficiallyJof loyalty to the project
nanagement, PAO office, and UINDP office. At a time
the UNDP office, in dealing with the PAO  project
experts, went far behihd its limits and overruled
the PAO office in this matter.

VIr IDA AND IFAD PEREORMWTOE
7.01 IDA most criticism was the exploitation of the
aquifer. 'Hoever measu=es were taken by the gover-
nment to limit the drastic effect of this ininingi
Throughout appraisal to completion of the project
the peoples realised the benefits gained from crop
production thus they dug more and more wells. There-
fore measures, of conserviig irrigation water must be
enc.ouraged i.e., continue laying the PVr pipes networks
on nore farms, introduce drip irriZation system etc.,
7.02 Thepowt of the OTA within the expatriate tean
proved to be not much necessary. It was very dif-
ficult to have a CTA with a trery wide experience in
one hand, and while it was found that a CTA with an
engineering backgtound would be much better for the
project than an agricultural one as in the appraisal
report, in the other hand. For future project it is
advisable that a full tine cTA is not required.
Instead, most senior and experienced expert is to
be assigned as a CTA with his other duties.
7.03 Field supervision of the protect through missions
was, for the engineering and agricultural componentst
efficient, conprehensive and effective as a whole.
Where for the financial matters it was neglected at
the early stages of the project. In general these
missions contributed sobstantially to the satisfactory
implementation of the various project components
which were in full accend with the governments priori-
ties expressed in the Second Five Year Plan.



- 50-
7.04 IDA, realising the ren(tness and solation of the
area and slackness behind schedule of the project
implementation  was very flexible with promurenent
procedures of goods and oivii works construction,
without this flexibility the project would not be ccf-
pleted at 1908.
7.05 NevertheleAs IFAD loan was  mi-nistered by IDA,
IFAD Field supervision also efficie$t though at a
lesser frequency than IDA's ones.
VtII SPECIAL iSSUS
3.01 The project was the first major investment in
the Beihan district. The area showed that a high
response to developnent. Therefore there is a great
need.for further development to keep menentun going.
8.02 In 1989 the whole country became saturated with
onions. The project area became the major supplier
to the rest of the country. In 1908 it produced
about 40% of national requirements of onions.
Therefore, while the construction of the ID; Pourth
Highway Project Wasit-Beihan road is near completiin,
the MAAR, must consider the potential of the project
area to produce other vegetables.
Future Development:
8.03 The overall cbJective of future development
must be the sustainability of agricultural produ-
¢tion through conserving the surface and ground
water resources. Emphasis shouTd be given to the
following issues :-



- 51 _
Expanding the PVC pipe irrigation network as in
phase I, to 3000 ha of cultiv'ated lands.
Installing waterneters on wells.
Encourage  farmers to introduce or buy drip-irrigation
system and provide the technical backstopping for this
purpose.
Introduce sone low-cost diversion structure to dis-
tribute spate flows.
Increase aquifer recharge by selecting proper sites
and to construct several infilteration basins, to
spread the excess spate flow in above normal years.
Strengthening the agricultural extension service and
monitoring surface and ground water resources and
irrigation works maintenance units through provision
of supplies, training and materials.
M-ore emphasis should be given to beneficiaries
participation in the project works.
These former issues should be considered for Vadi
Beihan and Ain as well.
Lessons Learned and Puture Developnent:
*8.04 Water is the major limiting factor for agric-
ultural production. Legislation of its use is of
prime importance to keep up the hundreds green spt.-
in the project area.
8.05 Maintenance and operation of irrigation works
and assuring continuous supply of farm inputs
i.e. fertilizers, plant chemicals, seeds..ete., to
the project area and strengthening the suitable



- 52 _
institutional units created under Dhase I, for these
works will be suffieient to keep up =omentum of dev-
elopment and accentuation cf the practices learned
by farmers durin- the project implementation.
3.06 The major Wadis agricultural development projects
have their ty-ical financial, adrinistrative, and
=snagerial Complications and thus, NA.AR Dust -ay due
attention to then and prepare and train the national
staff to assure smooth qnd un-interrupted implemen-
tation and maintenance of these projects.
3.07 Farmers of the area are hardworking individuals
and have proved their willinghess to partidipate in
the execution of the various project works.
x CONCLUSIONS
The main conclusions after the successful completion
of the project are :-
9.01 The future of the agricultural production in
Beihan depends on conserving the irrigation water.
Therefore development must continue and should
emphasise on extension of the PVC pipe network on
more farms along with other water conservation
methoAs, management of high spate flows, and c. tinue
supply of farm inputs :
9.02 With the Waset-Beihan road project a cropping
pattern with less onions but more leafy vegetables
must be encouraged immediately.
9.03 For future credits to farmers which involved
PVC pipe network, the process is to be si:plified



- 53 
i.e..farmers to be charged the cost of the materials
upto project site, and the govarnment grant should
be in the form of laying the PVC pipes through the
project unit.
9.04 The indiviAual farmers have contributed consid-
erably to the total crop -roduction even though they
benefitted less frnm on-farm irrigation improvement
works, therefore in future development this fact is
to be considered, to increase the potential of this
sector.
