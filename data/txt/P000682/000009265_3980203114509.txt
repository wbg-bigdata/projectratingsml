SECOND WOLAITA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 486-ET)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Wolaita
Agricultural Development Project in Ethiopia, for which Credit 486-ET was
approved in June 1974 for the sum of US$12.0 million. The Credit closing date
was extended from June 30, 1980 to December 31, 1981 hut not beyond. A final
disbursement was made on December 10, 1982 and a balance of US$379,585 was
cancelled effective that date.
The PCR was prepared by a Project Officer in the Bank's Regional
Mission in Eastern Africa (RMEA) and a consultant. The PCR is based on the
Government's Project Completion Report for the Project and on a review of all
relevant reports, correspondence and project documents. Government's PCR was
the work of an external consultant who visited the Project area and Addis
Ababa for about six weeks. Available Bank-staff previously associated with
project supervision offered their comments, and additional comments from the
Northern Agriculture Division of the Eastern Africa Regional Projects
Department were incorporated in the final report, submitted to OED on August
31, 1983.
The assistance provided by the Government of Ethiopia and that of
project staff in Soddo is gratefully acknowledged.
The project was not selected for audit by OED and the PCR was sent to
the Borrower on October 3, 1983 for comments; however, none were received.

ETHIOPIA
SECOND WOLA1TA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
CREDIT 4.86-ET
PROJECT co!4PLET ION REPORT
IIGHL IGHTS
The project was the Bank Group's ninth lending operation for
Agricultural development in Ethiopia. The first Wolamo (later changed to
Wolaita) Agricultural Development project concentrated on only two
sub-districts with about 6,000 farm famtilies within the Wolamo district and
demonstrated the efficacy of improved agricultural inputs provided in
conjunction with farmer credit, infrastructure, extension and other services.
The rate of farmer participation in the project was better than was originally
envisaged, and yield increases resulted in greater cash incomes for a large
segment of the rural population in the sub-districts.  The project was
implementced through the Wolaita Agricultural Development Unit (WADU).
The second phase projeci: commenced in 1975 and sought to (a) increase
crop production by providing inputs of improved seed, fertilizer and
pesticides on credit, and by encouraging farmers through strengthened
agricultural extension to adopt new cropping patterns and to use improved
inputs; (b) increase livestock production by cross-breeding local animals with
Friesian bulls, improved health services and increased fodder production; (c)
develop infrastructure to enable provision of agricultural extension services,
soil conservation services, the de'Xivery of inputs, transport of outputs and,
improved marketing; and (d) encourage cooperative development as the strategy
to ensure continuity of inputs supply and crop marketing and to achieve
sustained project impact.
Due to social probLems and unrest in the project area emanating from
the revolution in Ethiopia in 1974 and the Land Reform of early 1975 the rate
of project implementation and its impact were adversely affected. Political
and ethnic conflicts resulted in weak project management which changed six
times during the long life of the project (8 years). A high rate of turnover
of personnel in senior and middle level positions and overall poor staff
discipline were experienced. '-he Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) did not support
the project organization, WADIJ, with appropriate senior staff appointments and
did not support and supervise the project effectively. The project's
financial accounts were poorly naintained throughout. Project management was
not effective in taking actions to increase the impact on livestock production
or investigate and rectify problems affecting cooperative performance, a key
elemestt of the development program.



- iv -
The livestock improvement program failed because farmers were not
willing to crossbreed their animals with Friesians because their progeny would
require greater management and nutrition and were more vulnerable to diseases
and parasites. The livestock disease control and prevention program was
appropriate and is considered beneficial to the farming community. The soil
conservation program was highly successful and large numbers of farmeTs
participated in erosion control/prevention efforts 4nd in particular in
planting trees for fuel and polewood on highly erodable soils. The project
has generally been successful in developing infrastructure, including
buildings, roads, bridges and dams. The water supply program, however,
suffered a delay of over four years. Maintenance of infrastructure has been
poor due to inadequate recurrent funding and about one-third of the minor
roads are now impassable.  Construction of tracks and roads also contributed
somewhat to gully erosion in susceptible farming areas along these roads,
because runoff control structures and revegetation cover were inadequately
established.
Project benefits were lower than anticipated and in the last year of
the project only some 15,000 farmers, or 16% of appraisal estinates, made use
of the input supply system on credit. The main reason for a decline in farner
interest in credit packages (peak farmer involvement was 46,000 in 1976177)
was an adverse movement of input prices compared to those for cash crops, the
substantial subsistence requirements, and farmer ineligibility for credit.
The credit default rate had incTeased rapidly, reaching its peak also in
1976/77 and tho project organisation, WADU, was not effective in substantially
recouping debts or in pursuing defaulters, although improved trends are
indicated for 1979/80 and 1980/81. Determinatiot, of Project impact has been
difficult because of a paucity of data due to a lack of systematic monitoring
and evaluation. From deducted and available data, a negative rate of return
of -1.0% has been reestirnated.  Crop production may, however, have been
greater than assumed for these calculations because it is clained by MOA
authorities that the district is now exporting food grains, while the densely
populated district imported food grains before Project impLementation. This
is difficult to quantify because some food aid has been made available to
low-land areas in drought years.
It is not quite clear what course of action the Bank could have taken
in the early stages of project implementation (up to 1978). The project was
designed and appraised prior to the revolution of 1974 and, obviously,
policies of the new Government were affecting the farming community as well as
project management and the civil service at large. Government policies were
evolving slowly and in this fluid situation, IDA adopted a wait-and-see
attitude. With hindsight, Government should have been prompted more
effectively to undertake a major review of the project scope and design,
particularly in the late seventies, so that the project would have been
assured of full Government comnitment and support.
Following the deterioration of fertilizer and credit use, the applied
research component should have focussed on cultivation practices which farmers
could adopt to increase their production without the use of inputs (mainly



-v
fertilizers and improved seeds). The extension service, although it
commendably adopted the Training and Visit (T&V) system of extension in the
last two seasons, was not effective in transmitting the limited available
information that did not involve the use of expensive inputs. Farming systemns
research was not undertaken although local systems are complex and require
more detailed attention. Agro-economic and socio-economic data were not
available to make appropriate management decisions on crop and livestock
production strategies.
From the above and the PCR the major lessons from this project
experience can therefore be formulated as follows:
-    under dramatically changed circumstances a major review of project
scope and design seems to be called for (paras. 3.11, 7.04, 7.09 and
8.04);
-    project design clearly reflects the dilemma between continuity in
project implementation and thorough evaluation of earlier experiences
(paras. 2.01 and 7.01); and
-    the continuation with a design of an intensive agricultural
development project while a strategy of a minimum package approach
was already being implemented (para. 8.04).

ETHIOPIA
SECOND WOLAITA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 486-ET)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Y.   Background
Agricultural Sector
1.01     Ethiopia's agricultural sector accounts for 46% of GDP and about 90%
of export earnings and provides a livelihood to 80% of the population.
Agricultural growth, at 1.8% per year since 1974/75 has not kept pace with the
population growth rate of 2.8%. Coffee, the major export commodity is almost
entireLy produced by smallholders and accounts for 70-75% of export earnings.
Major food crops are teff, barley, maize, sorghum and wheat. Livestock is
important in numbers but low in production due to feed and water constraints
and health hazards; it contributes about 20% to the total agricultural
output. 3tate Farms and settlements, established after the 1974/75 revolution
and subsequent reforms, are only minor contributors to agricultural
production. Smallholder farmers have an intensive crop and livestock
production in the highlands and cattle, sheep and goats production under
semi-arid and arid range conditions in the lowlands.
1.02     The functional organisation unit in rural areas is the Peasant
Association (PA), each of which covers a minimum area of 800 hectares of
cultivated and grazing land. There are also PAs for pastoralists. The 25,000
PAs with a membership in excess of 7 million farmers are organized into
Service and Producers' Cooperatives. There are nearly 4,000 Service
Cooperatives in Ethiopia, while only 54 Producers' Cooperatives have been
registered, although many more (about 1,000) have been prepared, but have not
met registration requirements. The principle of Producers' Cooperatives is
the collectivisation of land. draft animals and implements. Service
Cooperatives provide essential goods and basic implements through cooperative
shops but have not functioned well in carrying out their other roles of
developing the use of storage facilities, providing inputs at favorable prices
to their members and developing agro-industries.
1.03     The Government's agricultural development effort, focussing on the
cooperatives and associations as instruments, has been in force since the
revolution of 1974. Although most development projects are based on the
underlying principle of improvement of the individual farmer the Government
has, particularly since 1979, laid emphasis on its policy of communal
development through Producer Cooperatives, which obtain preferential treatment
in terms of production credit and input supplies.
1.04     The major feature of the agricultural development policy since the
revolution has been to increase food crop production towards achieving a
higher degree of self-sufficiency.  The actual results, however, have been
that in the period 1974-78 food grain production has been approximately
maintained but the marketed output has fallen back due

t) rural population increases and higher per capita consumption. A
10-year Perspective Plan, which includes the agricultural sector is
currently under preparation by the Central Planning Supreme Council
(CPSC).  Governrnent priorities are expected to be:
(a)  continued emphasis on increasing food crop production;
(b)  multiplications of production cooperatives to raise the
production of the small farmer sector;
(c)  development of the country's scientific and technological
capability as c basis for increasing agricultural
productioni;
(d)  protection and development of natural resources;
(e)  development of livestock; and
(f)  increase of agricultural exports and of the raw material
base for processing.
Project Background
1.05     The first significant agricultural development projects were
undertaken in Ethiopia in the nid-1960s with the main emphasis on
comprehensive projects designed to develop limited areas through
intensive applications of inputs such as improved seeds, fertilizers and
other agro-chemicals. The first Wolaita (then Wolamno) Agricultural
Development Project (WADP-I) was appraised in 1968, became effective in
April 1970 and was completed 18 months ahead of schedule in June 1974.
This first project was successful in demonstrating the efficiency of
increased agricultural inputs in conjunction with farmer credit,
infrastructure, extension and other services. Farmer participation was
far better than anticipated.  A lowland settlement component was also
satisEactorily implemented. toth landlords and tenants benefitted
significantly from the coTnprehensive agricultural development program.
Produce marketing using private traders was preferred to sale through
cooperatives because of convenience, earlier payments and higher prices.
Livestock production and coffee marketing components were the least
successful Project components.2!
1.06     This PCR was prepared in Kay 1982 with the assistance of an RMEA
consultant who prepared a project evaluation report and a proposal for
continued services of the Wolaita Agricultural Development Unit (WADU)
for the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) in Sthiopia. The consultant was in
Ethiopia for six weeks in Novetaber and December 1981.
II.   Project Formulation
2.01     Identification and Preparation:  Because of the success of
WADP-I, which covered only two subdistricts of the Wolaita district, the
Government of Ethiopia (GOE) requested IDA in 1973 to assist in the
preparation and financing of a second phase project which would
incorporate all Wolaita subdistricts and include over 70,000 farmers,
compared to 10,000 fanmers under the first phase. MOA prepared the
project with assistance of RMEA. Although the Government initially
preferred a project which would concentrate on the distribution of farm

inputs on credit to smallholders ! it did agree to a comprehensive area
development approach proposed during, identification.  Government's
initial objecti3n to another comprehensive area developmont project was
based on the fact that khe heavy reliance on extension and other
Government services was not expected to be replicabl.e in other areas of
Et  jiop ia.
2.02     Objectives and Project Concept:  The main objective was to
increase crop and livestock prodaction through the provisioti of inputs on
credit where needed, and to increase livestock in the district through
crossbreeding and animal health programs. These objectives were to be
achieved through the expansion of WADU's extension, technical and
administrative services and througlh support for cooperatives. Soil
erosion problems in the district would be addressed througlh a soil
conservation program.  Required social infrastructure was to be provided
through upgrading rural roads, expanding rtural water supplies, and
providing assistance to rural artisans.
2.03     Credit Appraisal, Negotiations and Effectiveness:  The project
was appraised in October and November 1973. Because of IDA involvement
in Project preparation, project design and in particular manageiment
arrangements were mostly a continuation of the first project. However,
at negotiations ir. May 1974, several changes were agreed between IDA and
Government representatives:
(a) the implementing agency was to be the Extension and Project
Implementation Department (EPID) in MOA and not WADU as
under tthe first project (WADU would come under the
direction of EPID);
(b) the Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB) was
added as an onLending agency for the provision of seasonal
credit through cooperatives and WADU;
(c) WJADU was required to adopt acceptable project evaluation
guidelines;
(d) specific local fund allocations for road maintenance were
deleted; and
(e) IDA approval required before the appointment of seven
internationally recruited staff was changed to an agreement
for corLsultation with IDA before appointment of six
qualified and experienced staff in specific positions.
IDA agreed to these changes because they conforiued with the objectives of
the project and they ensure continuity from the first project.
2.04     Board approval was obtained on June 25, 1974 but Credit
Effectiveness was not declared until June 4, 1975 following five
postponements. Conditions of Credit Effectiveness could only be slowly
resolved because of the revolution in 1974.



-4-
These delays were due to:
-    a slow demarcation of settlement areas and granting of
leases to landholders; l/
-    1rte submission of the subsidiary loan agreement between
Government and the Agricultural and Industrial Development
Bank (AIDB) for onlending to farmers;
-    slow preparation of the agreement between AIDB and EPID for
the collection of credit and distribution of inputs ty WADU;
-    conclusion of an agreement between AIDB and the Wolaita
Farmers Cooperative Union (WFCU) for the provision of
credit to farmers;
-    slow completion of legal formalities for the incorporation
of WFCU; and
-    late recruitment of some senior staff.
Altogether, five extensions to the effectiveness deadline were necessary
before the credit was finally declared effective on June 4, 1975 (9
months delay). IDA had waived the lease condition, accepting a
Government assurance that settlers' rights would be protected under the
Land Proclamation Act of April 29, 1975.
2.05     Project Components:  Under WADP-II, the following specific
interventions would be undertaken to ensure that some 73,000 farmers in
year 5 and 100,000 farmers in year 9 would be provided with the
extension, technical and administrative services of WADU so that
production targets and other project objectives could be achieved:
(1) improved agricultural and livestock extension services
through demonstrations with fertilizers and improved seed
to farmer groups by some 200 extension agents in year 5
(ratio of about 1:500);
(2) extended soil conservation program on about 14,200ha per
year through contour plowing, gully stabilization and land
rehabilitation as well as tree plantings on badly eroded
areas from 14 small nurseries;
(3) expanded home economics service by about 42 field workers
with supporting staff and equipment;
(4) cooperative development through the establishment of an
additional 39 Cooperative Marketing Centers (CMC) which
would be responsible for the distribution of inputs, credit
administration and the marketing of produce. Until formal
registration, (expected 3 years after the establishment)
CMCs were to be owned and operated by WADU, when operating
costs would be gradually assumed by the cooperative
members, while construction costs would be shared between
WADU and farmers. The WFCU would provide accounting,
marketing and other support services and would also handle
all credit to cooperatives previously undertaken by WADU;

(5) provision of seasonal credit at an interest rate of 1% per
month for up to 11 months with farmers paying a downpaymont
of 25% of the value of inputs;
(6) livestock development through an extended cattle
crossbreeding (50,000 cattle per annum) and animal health
program, pasture improvement and fodder production through
an expanded livestock extension service. A poultry
upgrading program for production of imported cockerels and
buildings and facilities for rearing Friesian bulls would
be established. Vaccines and drugs for vaccination
campaigns and health services throughout the project area
and increased diagnostic support services would be
provided, (veterinary drugs were to be made available on
credit). Establislhment of a l,OOOha livestock holding
ground and a primary livestock market to handle the
incremental annual offtake of 14,000 head at full project
development;
(7) provision of WADU facilities through the construction of a
headquarter building, a water supply to staff quarters and
offices and the expansion of the workshop;
(8) construction of 366km of minor roads and 235km of tracks;
(9) provision of rural water supplies to about 60,000 families;
(10) assistance to rural artisans through training and the
provision of tools and equipment;
(11) expanded crop trial program through the provision of stores
and offices and equipment at 6 trial sites to allow crop
diversification work, fertilizer trials and fodder crop
reasearch;
(12) improved coffee cultivation program to 5,000 farners (by
year 5) through improved extension services, coffee
stumping demonstrations and fertilizer trial work;
(13) special consultancy studies for:
(a)  monitoring the soil conservation program to provide
data for a more extensive program of erosion control
in Ethiopia;
(b)  determining the suitability of available land for
further settlement in the district; and
(c)  the control and use of ranching land in the district;
and
(14) improve WADU's organisational efficiency.
2.06     The Appraisal report included the international recruitment of
seven senior staff: Project Director and Deputy Director of WADU, and
Heads of WADU's Extension and Training, Marketing and Credit divisions
and Cooperative Developments, Artificial Insemination and Animal Health
Section, and the Head of the Planning and Evaluation Unit. This
requirement was in response to the senior staff problems experienced
under WADP-1. During negotiations, however, it was agreed that EPID
would cause WADU to provide adequate and appropriately qualified and
experienced staff, following consultation with IDA (Section 4.01 of DCA).
2.07     Although efforts to increase livestock production were not
successful under the first project, similar, but more ambitious



- 6 -
crossbreeding, animal health and poultry programs, were proposed under
WADP-II. Coffee marketing also had not been successful undler WADP-I and
a different strategy, to increase coffee production through stumping and
pruning of old trees, disease control and new plantings with considerable
extension input was proposed.
III.   Implementation
3.01     Project activities commenced in the 1975/76 budget year,
commencing July 7, 1975, with a reduced local budget, which allowed some
infrastructure construction activities mainly roads and soil conservation
works. Details of project achievements for each WADU division and unit
for the period 1974/75 to 1980/81 are provided in the summary tables in
Annex I.
Annual Crop Production
3.02     There was an initial surge in the number of farmers obtaining
improved seeds and fertilizers, mostly on credit. The number of
participating farmers increased from 7,826 in 1974/75 to 46,151 in
1976/77, partly as a result of the increased number of eligible farmers
following Land Reform. After this initial success the number of
participating farmers declined gradually to 15,154 in 1980/81 despite an
increasingly active extension service which had adopted a modified but
poorly supervised and executed T&V system of extension with regular
visits to farmer groups. The decline in use of inputs, which were
successfully used in WADP-I, was mainly due to inadequate benefit-cost
ratios from the use of fertilizers and a high degree of ineligibility for
credit by Peasant Associations (PA) and thus all their members, because
of the credit rule under which farmers could not receive further credit
until 95% of the outstanding amount was repaid by the PAs.
3.03     The table below provides the number of farmers utilizing inputs
as compared with appraisal targets.

3.04     The project only had an impact on the production of maize, teff
and cotton. There is no data to suggest that inputs were used on other
crops and also improved crop varieties were not available. Projected and
actual crop yields are presented in the following tables:

Coffee Production
3.05     The Coffee improvement program was partly successful; farmers
were reluctant to take the drastic steps of stumping old trees but some
pruning and stumpings were, however, carried out. Releases of coffee
berry disease (CBD) resistant seedlings were made in later Project
years. Survival rates of planted CBD resistant seedlings were poor in
adverse weather in 1980 and 1981.
3.06     Although results from the coffee improvement program have not
been monitored, research data of doubtful accuracy indicate that yields
of stumped trees increase by 0.5 to 2.0kg of sun-dried coffee per tree.
Under the project about 159,000 trees were either stumped or pruned and
29,210 trees resistant to Coffee Berry Disease (CBD) were distributed
(omitting the large number of seedlings which were drought-killed).
Livestock Production
3.07     Cattle:  In general, the cattle cross-breeding program was a
failure. Only 2,896 live covers and 389 inseminations were achieved
during the project against appraisal estimates of 20,000 annually, of
which 75/ by Al.  The animal health program, in contrast, was greatly
appreciated by farmers. It led to a decrease in cattle mortality which

led to increased meat and milk production. The cattle growth-rate was
about 4% during the period 1974/75 to 1978/79 from a base population of
550,000 animals to presently about 780,000 animals.
3.08     Poultry:  The cockerel exchange programn operated for 4 years in
an effort to upgrade local stock and to increase meat and egg
production. Although this component had a high potential for success
only limited numbers of cockereLs could be exchanged (3,412 birds). This
was due to the high mortality rate of day-old and 3-week old chickens
during transport from Addis to Soddo (6 hour journey at least) and the
difficulties experienced in operating the late acquired incubator
(electricity failures). Benefits of this program were not included in
the economic return calculations since these were negligible and not
quantified.
3.09     Soil Conservation activities were executed with enthusiasm by
the responsible section head and staff, and they were able to motivate
farmers. Physical targets for contouring and bunding, drainage of low
lying lands and tree planting were exceeded and are highly visible
throughout the district. Some 31,500ha of land benefitted from
contouring and bunding, some 6,120ha were drained and almost 4,000ha of
land was afforested.
3.10     Infrastructure was generally completed within the time frame set
in the development schedule at appraisal. A country-wide shortage of
materials in the early project years delayed construction of buildings.
Delays in tendering and contract award and a slow rate of construction by
the parastatal, the Ethiopian Construction Corporation, resulted in the
late completion of WADU headquarters at wuore than double envisaged
costs. Road construction exceeded targets, but the construction of some
roads and also road maintenance of a considerable road mileage by both
WADU and the farming community has been below acceptable standards.  The
large cattle market and a large cattle holding ground envisaged at
appraisal were not constructed because they were found to be
unnecessary. There were considerable delays in the provision of water
supplies to some settlement areas and villages and the number of
households reached was only 32.4% of the appraisal target.
3.11     Cooperatives:  There are now 55 Service and 17 Producer
Cooperatives established, aad most of these were provided with the
required facilities. WADU secretaries were posted to each cooperative to
assist in managing the societies, but the cooperatives failed to be
successful as produce marketing bodies because they attained insufficient
farmer produce, mostly because they offered lower prices than local
traders. The management committees were also not able to assume full
administrative responsibilities for credit administration, input supplies
and produce marketing, mainly because WADU failed to train farmers in
cooperative management.
3.12     Mana&gement:  WADU produced detailed work plans with budgets and
quarterly, half yearly and annual reports. However, these were often
prepared late. Detailed physical achievements of each division, section
and unit were provided and these were compared with targets set in the
annutal work plans. Unfortunately, this documentation of physical targets
displaced the more important need for monitoring and evaluating the



- 9 -
impact of project activities on agricultural production and on economic
and social conditions in the district. Although some random crop
sampling surveys were conducted each year, the methods used and the lack
of training and diligence of inex3erienced enumerators (mostly extension
agents) and supervisors resulted n unreliable data. Data for tile 1979,
1980 and 1981 crop harvests has nc' been analysed, and some individual
programs, such as coffee improvement, livestock development and soil
conservation have not been monitored. No reliable data is available on
the area cropped or used for livestock, despite WADU reports of a
significant increase in crop area since the Land Reform. RMEA's
supervision missions were not successful in effecting data collection and
analysis.
3.13     WADU failed to reassess the various project activities and
unsuccessful programs continued to be funded. EPID, in early 1978,
completed an evaluation of WADP-II and addressed at that time the primary
objectives of increased crop and livestock production. The underlying
issues were, however, ignored, most likely because these issues were
national in character (such as cooperative development, fertilizer
pricing, and credit eligibility) which were to be addressed at the
national, rather than the district level. EPID's role in supervising the
implementation of the project through WADU was not clearly defined and in
any case, EPID's disbandment in early 1979 destroyed this planned working
relationship. At all times, WA.DU was effectively the project executing
agency.
3.14     Studies:  Under the Project three specific studies were to be
done:
(a)    A Soil Conservation Monitoring Program which called for
the construction of a hydrometric measuring station for
run off and silt load data collection of twin catchments
- one unimproved and the other with all required soil
coniservation measures taken - and the monitoring of
erosion and crop production in the twin catchments.
Because oE the late appointment of the firm of
consultants and the delays in construction (shortages of
cement and lack of priority by WADU management), run-off
recording commenced only in 1981. Following iniitial
observations by RMEA staff and by adinission of the
consultants, it appears that the hydrometric station has
been overdesigned. (Under estimation of soil
permeability and infiltration rates and over-estimation
of rainfall, partly because of inefficient data resulted
in an unnecessary large concrete structure) The twin
catchments of about 65 ha each may also be too small for
obtaining reliable erosion and crop production effects
from protective measures taken (more information is,
however, required to establish this nore precisely).
(b)    The Availability of Land for Further Settlement Study
became obsolete because of the Land Reform Proclamation
(No. 31 of 1975) which caused a complete change in land
tenure and the reallocation of Large holdings to former
tenants and landless peasants.



- 10 -
(c)    A study on the Control and Use of Ranching Land was also
not required because of the shortage of suitable land in
the high and middle altitudes of the district and the
occupation of non-settlement lowland areas by
semi-nomadic pastoralists after the Land Reform.
IV.   Project Costs, Financing, Procurement and Accounting
4.01     Total project costs were 5% higher than appraisal cost estimates
of US$17.32 million. Actual disbursements were 647% of total costs as
compared with the appraisal estimate of 69%. Government funding was thus
higher in both percentage and in actual fund allocations, mainly because
of the extended Project period when staff salaries and operating costs
were substantial.
4.02     Project costs by category are presented in the following table:

4.03     When compared to total appraisal cost estimates, significant cost
overruns occurred under categories IV (WADU buildings, 315%), IX (WADU
salaries, 67%) and X (WADU operating costs, 103%). These overruns were
financed from unallocated funds in the Credit, additional funds from GOE and
from under-expended funds in other rategories.  Significant underspending
occurred in Categories I (Incremental Farms Inputs, 35%), III (Vehicles, 58%),
VII (Water Supplies, 63%) and VIII (Rural Artisans, 26%).
4.04     Reasons for cost overruns are:
(a)   inflation in construction costs, the very high cost
of the WAUU headquarters buildings and hydrometric
measuring unit because of a comLination of infLation
and overdesign, and an expanded construction program;



- 11 -
(b)   increases in WADU salaries and operating costs due to
a 1 1/2 year extension of Project Clo"i'ig Date, the
employment of more staff than anticipatted (except
extension agents), high vehicle maintenance costs; and
(c)   the failure of WADU management to control project
activities based on cost-effectiveness, which
resulted in programs that should have been reduced in
scope or stopped.
4.05     More than two-thirds of IDA disbursements (US$8.4 million) were
for WADU salaries and operating costs, again mainly because of the
extended Project duration.  If wages and other operating costs for road
construction, water supply and assistance to cooperatives and rural
artisans are included, IDA funded at least 70% of the recurrent
expenditures of the project operations, which compares with 49% of the
local costs anticipated at appraisal. Less investments were inade than
intended on vehicles, machinery and equipment, and water supplies. The
reasons are not entirely clear, but MoA did not purchase adequate
replacement vehicles and equipment possibly because of anticipated
restrictions in funding future operating costs.
Local Funding
4.06     Local. funds were allocated as presented below for the period
1975/76 to 1980/81. Categorization is only approximate because MOF
allocations are not made in accordance with IDA disbursement categories:

Local fund allocations by NOF do not include Government subsidies and other
indirect costs such as the provision of vaccinations for livestock, the
provision of the coffee and other tree seedlings and research materials.
Also, administrative overheads of MOA and AIDB are not included. Excluded are
also the AIDB financed incremental inputs which are estimated to have cost
Birr 1,917,312 (US$929,238) and the project costs for the project extenaion
period from kpril 7 to December 31, 1981, which are estimated to have been
Birr 1.2 million (US$580,000 approximately).
IDA Funding
4.07     Final IDA disbursements were approved in September 1982, following
receipt of the RMEA requested satisfactory certification of SOEs by auditors.
4.08     Almost every year, financing of 1OA-approved budgeted activities was
con trained by a shortfall in Government funding. In addition funds were
often made available late, particularly from 1978/79 onwards. MOF ascribed
this to the poor performance of WADU managenent in accounting for alloted
funds, unicertainty of obtaining benefits because of lack of performance
indicators, WADU's doubtful ability to spend the funds on budgeted activities
and last but in some years not least, a shortage of GOE funds. HOF also
complained about the poor performance of WADU and MOA in preparing Credit
withdrawal applications in a timely manner.
4.09     Procurement:  MOA. continued to be responsible for WADU procurement
after the disbandment of EPID and no unusual problems were reported. However,
long delays were experienced in obtaining spare parts and building materials,
sometimes because of national shortages, but poor planning was also one of the
reasons for a shortage of critical spare parts.  A shortage of cement caused
delays in the construction of buildings and the hydrometric measuring
station. WADU maintained a purchasing office in Addis Ababa for the
procurement of local goods. Auditors commented adversely on WADU stores
control and only one physical stocktaking (1980) was done.
4.10     Accounting:  Poor accounting and processing of withdrawal
applications by WADU led to substantial mispostings of expenditures and in the
miscategorization on withdrawal application forms which caused disbursement
delays. Following visits by RHEA financial analysts to WADU, it was decided
by RMEA to suspend disbursements on SOEs in September 1981.  On receipt of
satisfactory certificates by auditors on outstanding SOEs final disbursements
were made in late 1982.  rhe schedule of disbursements is presented in Annex 3.
4.11     The original Project Completion Date was postponed from June 30, 1979
to June 30, 1981 - a full two years, to complete project construction
activities, and to get WADU to do various surveys to establish Project
impact.  The Project Closing Date was extended from June 30, 1980 to December
31, 1981 due to the delayed Project implementation and to allow a full audit
of all outstanding SOEs. The Closing Date was informally extended thereafter
because GOE aade determined efforts to obtain the requested audits of
outstanding SOEs; disbursements were then made on SOEs received prior to March
31, 1982. The outstanding Credit amount of US$379,585.40 was cancelled
effective December 10, 1982, the date of final disbursement. 1/

V.   Institutiorial Performance
Performance of the Borrower
5.01     MOA did not perform well as the Ministry responsible for project
extension. The following specific deficiencies were identified:
(a)   staff performance;
(b)   senior staff appointments;
(c)   cooperative development; and
(d)   accounts and audits.
Project Management and Staffing
5.02     After negotiations, EPID was to be the implementing agency with WADU
its executing agency as a self-contained unit of EPID. EPID was to provide
assistance in project monitoring and evaluation and procurement.  Following
the disbandment of EPID in 1979, a Ministerial Committee in MOA took over the
coordinating role, while the WADU management became directly responsible
through the Regional Agricultural Office in Awassa (Southern Region) to the
Permanent Secretary of MOA. The WADU Project Director changed six times from
1975 to 1979. The first one was removed because of staff and local unrest
following the revolution, several acting directors followed in 1975, 1977 and
1978 and the present Director was appointed in August 1979 (in March 1978, an
acting Director was detained). It has been most unfortunate that the Deputy
Director position was not filled after 1975 since this resulted in poor
internal project coordination in the absence of strong and experienced Project
Directors. Coordination from the Regional office in Awassa was in essence
non-existent.
5.03     Total staff numbers increased rapidLy, from 540 in 1974/75 to 1,143
in 1978/79, mainly in the junior and unskilled categories. It proved
difficult to attract experienced technical ard professional staff because of a
general shortage of these categories in Ethiopia.  Living conditions in or
near Soddo, which is realtively isolated and distant from Addis Ababa, were
also not attractive to qualified and experienced staff and this further led to
a high staff turnover and a large number of vacancies at management and
technical levels. The greatest drain on experienced staff has been the
required internal transfers to other MOA positions.  One of the reasons that
the number of unskilled staff continued to be high was the regulation that
staff had to become permanent enployees if hired for more than three months
(this condition has now been abolished). This resulted in the employment of a
considerable number of unskilled construction workers, who in later years
became underemployed. Staff discipline was poor, with absenteeism and short
working hours being common.
5.04     The relationship between management and staff within WADU were
strained particularly in the early Project years.

Source:  Personnel Section of WADU.
Note:    Statistics are for staff present at the end of each financial
year.
5.05     The staff Training Centre operated by WADU at Soddo has
generally been under-utilized (about 50% of the capacity) because of
Government funding constraints. All new extension staff received basic
training in a long-term course and annual refresher courses were held.
Appraisal training targets were exceeded, but the standard of training of
extension agents has been low, mainly because the trainers were
insufficiently qualified and experienced. Nine WADU staff were selected
for training at higher education institutions in Ethiopia and the head of
the Soil Conservation Division received overseas training. Although not
foreseen at appraisal, greater technical staff training could have been
done, using WADU facilities.
5.06     Project management in the early years was extremely difficult
following the revolution and the land reform which caused problems in
staff compatability with the local population and led to a decline in
staff discipline and morale. The sudden large increase in the number of
fanrers eligible for project services, which WADU was not geared to
handle, was and could not be envisaged at appraisal. Cooperation with
the district administration was good throughout. The Director of WADU
was a member of Wolaita District Development Committee and at
sub-district level WADU staff was also represented on development
committees.  This close relationship, however, led to devotion of WADU
personnel, equipment and vehicles to non-project activities and some
non-project costs were borne by WADU. These costs have been accounted
for and are to be repaid. Most of the construction and service costs
involved have been traced and were identified as closely related to
project activities. Disbursements were not affected because only a few
minor items which were not project related were deducted from SOE claims
after a thorough audit of all claims under SOE was submitted in the last
year.



- 15
Cooporative Deve Ionent and Credit
5.07     Cooperatives:  Following the revolution and Land Refoiin,
cooperative policy was under revision and resulted in guidelines on
development and a Government Proclaination of policy and procedures to be
followed.  The Ministry of Agriculture would be responsible for
implementing the policy. Peasant Associations and Cooperatives would
become the main instruments of agricultural development in Ethiopia.  The
WCFU was abolished, but WADU continued to support the established
cooperatives in the district, both financially and administratively,
although this support was to have been phased out after the third year of
cooperative establishment. In 1981 there were 269 Peasant Associations
with 150,572 memnbers organized in 55 Service Cooperatives. Of the Service
Cooperatives 37 are registered and have storage and office facilities as
well as a retail sales section. WADU employed a secretary for each
cooperative whose responsibility for assistance in cooperative management
was not phased out. Only little progress was made in making the
cooperative self-managed and self-accounting. Considerable effort
continues to be required from WADU to achieve self-sufficiency goals in
input purchasing and distribution, and financial management.
5.08     In 1981, there were 17 Producer Cooperatives which have received
considerable preferential treatment from WADU.  Tractor services for land
preparation have been made available and extension services have greatly
focussed on communal farm activities and subsidised credit and inputs
-were made available. Also beef cattle fattening herds have been provided
on credit and demonstration units for poultry, bee-keeping,
compost-making, improved houses etc., have been established at the
Producer Cooperatives. Achievements and benefits are variable and some
internal farmer disputes have been observed.
5.09     Under WADP-II, a total of 38 cooperative stores were
constructed. Cooperative members were to contribute half of the
construction costs. However, farmers' contributions in land, labor and
local materials have not been properly recorded. Only total costs of
construction are reasonably well known and IDA reimbursements were for
50% of these construction costs. It remains doubtful, if cooperative
members can or will repay the Government half of store construction costs
over a period from 5-12 years, as has been legally agreed with MOA.
5.10     Credit:  The Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB)
provided funds under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement (SLA) for short and
medium term credit to farmers. Following the Land Reform Proclamation of
1975, the agreement became obsolete. AIDB then financed farmer credits
with its own funds which could not be reimbursed by IDA until a new SLA
was drawn up and approved in 1981. An inter-agency agreement between the
Agricultural Marketing Corporation (AMC), AIDB and MOA provided for AIDB
to make credit available to cooperatives and peasant associations for the
purchase of inputs from AMC. Disbursenent was against the incremental
credit, which amounted to US$ 1,089,590. The number of borrowers
increased from 6,843 in 1974/75 to 32,107 in 1975/76 and declined
thereafter to 15,154 in 1980/81. The amount of credit outstanding for
farm inputs is as follows:

Total:               1,455,025.72              l,917,31.2.15
Following the revolution, credit recovery fell from 90% in 1973/74 to 65%
in 1974/75 because many farmers felt that socialism would extend to the
cancellation of their loans and debts.  Cumulative repayments stood at
82% in 1980/81.  WADU was not able to pursue the rapidly increasing
number of debtors in the early years.
5.11     InfrastL'ucture Development:  WADU's Infrastructure Division has
generally carried out its assignment efficiently on force account.  The
only major delay (apart from those because of shortages of cement,
materials and spare parts for machinery) was in the provision of water to
the lowland settlement areas and villages in the highlands. The
efficient project engineer proposed the purchase of a drilling rig for
the construction of deep boreholes equipped with pumps. Following the.
preparation of a cost-benefit proposal, IDA did not agree to the purchase
of a rig, (mainly because of the availability of other rigs in the
country, uncertainty of future use, and availability of operating funds)
and a neighbouring Development Unit (Arsella) then made its rig
available. One of the reasons for postponement of the Project Closing
Date was the desirability of providing potable water to villagers. Even
at project closure, the number of people served with water from WADU
provided facilities remiains only one third of that estimated at
appraisal. Considerable improvements were made to existing wells and
springs in the district, but the number of beneficiaries is unknown.
5.12     Road Maintenance:  Despite GOE assurances, maintenance has been
very poor and supervision missions should have given more emphasis to
this aspect since poor road maintenance was also evident in the earlier
Project. tt is estimated that about one-third of the minor roads (these
are the major roads into villages) are in disrepair and impassable, while
an unknown, but significant distance of tracks are also out of use.  WA'DU
and the district administration are trying to rectify the situation
through self-help road maintenance by villagers, but support is not
everywhere readily forthcoming. Many roads and tracks were, following
construction, inadequately protected from erosion and in some instances
the run-off from roads is causing erosion on farmer lands.
5.13     Settlement Schemes were one of the key components of WADP I and
were to be further supported under WADP II. Although specific production
data is not available and settler movements are not recorded, it is
reported by WADU that about a third of all farmers settled in the two
lowland schemes (1,750 families) during the first phase project, have
since left their plots as a result of erratic climatic (drought)
conditions and poor returns from cash crops. Some deserted plot.s have
been taken up by squatters.



- 17 -
5.14     Accounts and Audits:  WADU accounts have been inadequately
maintained and it is impossible to obtain accurate sub-project coatings.
Audits were carried out late by a firm of auditors, and all annual audit
reports contained many qualifications. IDA withheld disbursement on
Statements of Expenditures (SOE) and for construction costs for
cooperative stores utnder Category V of DCA. Disbursements were, however,
finalised following receipt of a satisfactory sTecial audit report by the
Government's Audit Services Corporation, dated September 14, 1982.  Some
minor adjustments to the various claims were found necessary.
VI.   Project Benefits, Pinancial and Economic Analvsio
6.01     Project impact has been less than expected although no
statistics are available to measure the shortfall from appraisal
targets. In determining the nature and extent of project impact, it is
not possible to disaggregate the results of the project from the
influence of the Revolution and Land Reform in Ethiopia. The
consequences of the Revolution affected project performance mainly in
impairing the ability of management to direct and administer staff in the
early project years. The effect of Land Reform on the aumber of farra
holdings and the area of cultivated land is also not documented. From
observations, it appears, however, that more grazing laud has been
brought under cultivation.
Evaluation
6.02     Baseline agricultural data is almost totally lacking.  Neither
cropped or pastured land areas nor crop yields, crop production and
livestock numbers and off-take are available. Although MOA and WADU were
well aware of these data constraints no serious efforts were made to
remedy the situation. Even the unreliable data collected by extension
workers during the annual crop sampling surveys has not been properly
tabulated and analysed for the last three crop seasons. This lack of
data has contributed to the difficulties in attempting to disaggregate
the impact of the project activities and the impact of the Land Reform on
land use and crop production in the district. It has only been possible
to approximate the gross production changes that have taken place in the
district and to impute the possible constribution made by the development
and service components under WADU. The manpower to carry out data
collection and evaluation was present but management and staff commitment
was not forthcoming for executing it. Poor accounting, particularly
inadequate recording of expenditures for different components (paras.
5.14), adds difficulties to financial and economic evaluation. 1/
6.03     Incremental crop production was determined from imputed
incremental yields and crop area estimates based on inputs supplied
through WADU and cooperatives. Benefits from the coffee program were
calculated on the basis of number of trees stumped, and the tree
management programs implemented. Despite a lack of data, incremental
livestock production was estimated from the animal health component. The
cross-breeding program was basically unsuccessful. Soil conservation
1/ Data collected and financial accounting were also very poor under
the first project.

benefits were substantial but not quantified and incremental production
wab estimated.  Since approximations and assumptions were made, the
evaluation results must be treated with considerable caution.
6.04     It has not been possible to calculate project impact on farm
incomes. However, the decline in the use of inputs suggests that farmers
did not realize adequate benefits to warrant their usage. This is,
however, a debatable assumption since Peasant Associations and thus many
farmers (29,000 at Project Closure) were ineligible for credit for the
purchase of seasonal inputs due to loan arrears.
Project Benefits, Financial and Economic Analysis.
6.05     Annual Crops:   Incremental annual crop production has been
calculated from the use of inputs and the expected reasonable crop-yield
increases (based on research results adjusted to farmer field
situations). No impact from more intensive or extensive use of crop land
has been assumed. Annex 2 provides supporting data and the table below
compares the peak incremental crop production (in 1976/77) with the
appraisal projections at full development.

a/  Production of annual crops has fallen since reaching a peak in 1976/77.
6.06     It is most unfortunate that there are no data to support crop
production estimates over the years. It is believed that the Wolaita
district before the present Project was in some years importing
substantial quantities of food grains and it appears that there is now in
some years evidence of considerable, but again unquantifiable, export
from the district. On the other hand, some food aid has been available
to the Bele and Abele lowland settlement areas in drought years. Crop
production, although apparently declining since 1976/77, may therefore
have been higher than indicated.

a/ Production is thought not to have fallen, since it is the experience
of extension staff that farmers were only willing to stump
non-productive trees. Results are from both stumped and

and no records were kept of off-spring produced. It was therefore
assumed that any possible benefits are, or will be, offset if the
opportunity cost of crossbreeding is considered; local bulls would have
been used instead and the cross-bred offspring would have been
susceptible to diseases, poor nutritional conditions, and parasites which
would have to be offset against any benefits from possible increased milk
and meat production. Livestock production benefitted most from the
health services due to the resultant decrease in mortality which led to
increased meat and milk production.
6.10     Scanty available data indicates a compounded net livestock
growth rate in the district of 4.5% in the period 1971/72 to 1976/77
(505,000 animals in 1971/72 and 625,000 animals in 1976/77). The present
livestock population is thought to be less than 780,000, which a 4.5%
compounding rate would indicate. A growth rate of 4% per annum has
therefore been assumed at a base population of 550,000 animals in 1974/75
and one fourth of the growth has been attributed to the project.

are difficult to quantify, firstly because the extent of their adoption



- 21 -
by the rural community is unknown and secondly their value is difficult
to assess. Basic infrastructure provided by WADU in the Wolaita district
is of economic (e.g. roads and stores for cooperatives) and social (e.g.
water supply schemes, health clinic and home economics services) benefit
to the community. These benefits include those from improved water
supplies due to: cleaning, protecting and development of springs and
other water supplies; increased tree plantings on farms for fuel and pole
wood; use of improved crop storages on farms; the acceptance of new house
(both exterior and interior) designs and other benefits from the home
economics program; the general improvement in animal health (donkeys,
goats and chickens) from the health program, and the general improvements
in plant densities and row cultivation techniques recommended by
extension agents. Improved living standards are claimed by both farmer
groups and extension workers.
Management
6.14     rhe reasons for poor overall project performance trace largely
back to an ineffective project management, which failed to institute
effective fiscal controls and cost-benefit monitoring through appropriate
monitoring and evaluating programs and cost effectiveness measurements of
individual project components0 The performance of management must,
however, also be seen against the backdrop of the revolution, ethnic
problems and staff delinquency.
Financial Analysis
6.15     Rates of Return  Inadequate records and costing data prevents
the calculation of the returns for individual project components.
Project evaluation is thus based upon a financial evaluation in which
estimated gross project benefits and total costs have been compared. An
economic analysis is then derived from the financial analysis.
6.16     For the financial analysis, benefits from crop and livestock
production and from soil conservation efforts have been estimated to give
the benefit stream, while total IDA and GOE contributions have been taken
as project costs. Indirect Government costs such as outstanding input
debts, veterinary drugs used, interest on MOF bridging finance and an
allowance for MOA's indirect costs were not included as project costs.
6.17     Benefits, calculated as the financial value of crop and
livestock production and soil conservation (as outlined in Annex 2) are
summarized as follows:

6.19     Financial Rate of Return  the financial rate of retulrn was
calculated using a cashflow analysis of the direct costs and benefits.
All transactions are expressed in 1980/81 values. A salvage value has
been included as benefit in the final project year (L981/82).  A negative
financial rate of return of about -6% is estimated.
6.20     Non-quantifiable benefits (para 6.12) and indirect benefits
(e.g. research activities) would, if accounted for in this analysis,
raise the beneficial impact of the project; and it must be noted that it
is possible that annual crop production could be substantially higher
than indicated here if we accept MOA observations that the district has
become a food-grain export area over the Life of the project (see also
para 6.05).

follows: crop developmetit 17.5%, livestock development 2L.2%, soil
conservation 11.2%, and coffee improvement 26%.  Due to the
abovementioned (para 6.01) difficulty of disaggregating the costs
associated with separate components, only an overall ERR has been
estimated for this report.
6.22     The general lack of data available for project evaluation has
meant that a good deal of educated guesswork has been needed in order to
construct the foregoing financial analysis. This effectively limits its
usefulness, and the usefulness of an economic analysis derived from it.
The value of both exercises is that they indicate in broad quantitative
terms the degree to which this project failed to meet its objectives.
6.23     Transforming the financial analysis into an economic analysis
has required the following adjustments:
(a) to costs:
(i)    in an attetapt to remove frorn the cost-stream those
costs associated with outputs for which benefits have
not been estimated (roads, assistance to rural
artisans, rural water supplies), a fixed percentage
has been deducted from project costs for each year
between 1975/6 and 1981/2, based on an estimate of the
proportion of overall disbursements represented by
those activities.
(ii)    incremental labor inputs into annual crop and coffee
production and soil conservation activities have beeti
estimated and shadow-priced at 25% of local
agricultural wage-labor rates.
(iii)    project inputs with foreign exchange components,
fertilizer, equipment, fuel) have been valued upwards
by 34% to reflect their true cost to the economy
(assuming a shadow rate of exchange of Br. 2.70 to the
dollar).



- 24 -
(b) to benefits:
(i)     where appropriate - i.e. in the case of maize, cotton
and coffee - estimated project outputs have been
revalued using the appropriate import or export parity
prices,
(ii)    in the case of teff, for which there is no world
market and for which it is assumed that no
satisfactory substitute exists, Addis Ababa open
market prices have been used to shadow-price output.
(iii)    local output market prices have been used for live
cattle output.
6.24     The resultant discounted cashflow analysis gives an economic
return to the Project of approximately -1%. Even though this is based on
conservative assumptions as to yield/output benefits, it is clear that
the project fell short of achieving reasonable results.  The main cause
of this is the estimated low impact of project activities on agricultural
production, particularly following pToject closure. The appraisal report
foresaw cost increases, and not poor production results, as the major
project risk.
VII.   Bank Performance
Identification and ppraisal
7.01     Because of the Government's and IDA's desire to retain momentum
and to ensure continuity in the development of both infrastructure and
agricultural development in the district, WADP-II was too quickly
prepared. Plans for a second phase project were made before a thorough
evaluation of the impact of the first project had been done. This led to
a repetition of design weaknesses and shortcomings in both project
operations and performance. In particular, the livestock component
perpetuated the weaknesses detected in the first project (PPAR, DED
Report No. 2570, dated June 28, 1979). It is concluded that the repeater
project should not have been embarked upon without a thorough evaluation
of the performance of the ongoing or earlier phase. Appraisal estimates
for incremental crop and livestock production and for cooperative
development were over-optimistic, but this could not have been foreseen
(Revolution and land reform).
7.02     During project preparation there was an ongoing debate on the
agricultural policy direction in Ethiooia. In the event it was decided
to continue with another limited area, but comprehensive irtegrated,
agricultural development project in the Wolaita district and at the same
time to evaluate the impact of the minimum package (basic extension
services and input supplies approach). From WADP-I and II, it is
concluded that the comprehensive area development approach was at the
time, beyond the technical (management, staffing) and financial capacity
of Ethiopia as the general agricultural development policy (para. 8.04).
7.03     Although the appraisal teaM provided for the international
recruitment of seven key staff for periods varying from two to five



- 25 -
years, this requirement was deleted during negotiations, and only
consultation with IDA was required for the appointments or
re-appointments to the positions of Director of WADU, Heads of the
Extension Training, the Marketing and Credit and the Finance Divisions;
and the Heads of the Cooperative Development and Artificial Insemination
Sections. COE's experiences with expatriate personnel under WADU-I had
been mixed and this caused considerable resentment to the further
employment of expatriates in Soddo. The managerial and technical
training and experience of most senior MOA personnel assigned to WADU
was, however, inadequate. With hindsight, it is considered a mistake for
IDA not to have insisted on the appointment of a Deputy Project Director
with particular responsibilities for coordination/planning of WADU
activities. Project monitoring and evaluation, which tasks were
originally assigned to EPID and later to MOA in conjunction with WADU's
Planning, Evaluation and Budget Control Unit (PEBCU), was totally
inadequate. Clearly, this second phase project was too ambitious fat- the
technical and managerial capacity of the MOA administration and this
possibly could have been foreseen frot experiences under WADP-I in which
staffing, data collection and evaluation and accounting were also poor.
7.04     Preparation and appraisal teams could not foresee the revolution
and the subsequent land reform which had quite dramatic effects on the
number of potential beneficiaries and the land use. The main project
impact was to be derived from incremental crop production from the use of
inputs and from changing cropping patterns as farners adopted more
profitable cropping systems which were to result in cash income. The
appraisal team could not predict the present predominance of subsistence
agriculture in the WoLaita district, whichl prevented cash cropping to a
great extent.  High fertilizer prices and resulting low returns from
crops, together with mainly subsistence use of produce and the changed
farmer attitude to credit repayments as a result of the Revolution,
prevented satisfactory credit repayments.  Once farmers were in default,
produce was sold to private traders for higher prices than could be
obtained from cooperatives.  At appraisal, little was known about
traditional cropping systems in the expanded project area and predictions
for future cropping patterns and crop yields were therefore highly
speculative.
7.05     Although there was little knowLedge about cropping systems and
their integration with livestock, the appraisal team did not include a
comprehensive baseline survey to identify the smallholder production
constraints and the required applied research activities. The
constraints in a basic subsistence agricultural system was not assessed
before the Revolution.  An experienced farm management economist was
sadly missed during project implementation in a district, where farm
plans and gross margin calculations had not received sufficient attention 1/.
The non-acceptance by farmers of Boran x Friesian crossbreeds could have
been foreseen at appraisal from the lack of crossbreed popularity and the
achievements under the first project.
1/ A senior economist was appointed after supervision missions
pursued the issue, but he resigned after only a year in position.
A junior economist spent little time on crop budgets.



- 26 -
7.06     The design of the cooperative. component overlooked the
fundamental cooperative problems of management and financing, which are
necessary to ensure usefulness and effectiveness. The appraisal required
a substantial expansion of cooperatives despite the fact that WADP-I liad
shown that cooperatives were not successful as marketing bodies due to a
shortage of working capital, low turnovers and high operating costs. The
appraisal team could not, however, have foreseen the development of
peasant associations as the main instruments in agricultural development
following the revolution.
Project Supervisions
7.07     During the 6 1/2 years of credit effectiveness, twelve
supervisions were carried out by RMNA. One mission was combined with the
final supervision of WADP-I which investigated the issues which delayed
declaring effectiveness of WADP-IE. Five of the twelve supervisions were
conducted without the presence of one of the previous supervision
personnel and a total of eleven IDA staff members were involved in
supervision missions. The first four supervisions, during the difficult
period following land reform and WADU management staff changes, when
project directions required careful review and assessment, were conducted
by different supervisors.  Only fromT 1980 onwards was there supervision
staff continuity.
7.08     Despite the supervision staff changes, mission   ports are
thorough, with officers highlighting specific problems, assessing the
performances of individual divisions, sections and units of WADU in
relation to project implementation, and offering solutions to major
problems. An exception is in the failure to address the lack of
mionitoring and evaluation of project impact on crop and livestock
production. This problem received little attention before 1979. In
1980, however, a special mission was mounted in an effort to get MOA to
at least determine crop areas and yields as well as some gross margin
calculatLons on crops for which extension recommendations were available.
7.09     Project supervisions consistently noted three major constraining
issues:
(a)  effectiveness of project tanagement, higher and middle
level staff vacancies, staff morale, discipline and
motivation;
(b)  deficiencies in project accounts, late submission of
accounts and audit reports; and later on
(c) lack of data collection and evaluation.
Although all thTee continuously identified constraints to project
effectiveness were covered by Credit covenants, none of the supervision
missions recommended firsn action by IDA in the form of the need for
redesign or suspension of disbursements until the problem was rectified.
It was not until late 1981, when disbursements against SOEs were
suspended due to inadequate supporting accounts, late account
submissions, and heavily qualified audit reports on accounts from earlier
project years.  Missions generally focussed nore on technical and
managerial aspects than on actual disburserents and fund allocations.



- 27 -
Actual use of funds for the different Project components could only be
checked through proper accounts; thus the cost effectiveness of
individual components could not be evaluated.
7.10     It is evident from supervision reports that missions lacked
quantitative data to evaluate project impact. The fundamental issues of
low project impact on crop and livestock production, poor cooperative
development and performance, and the declining viability and
acceptability of input use recommendations were not adequately addressed
until 1979, when results from crop sampling surveys, a decline in input
usage and the failure of the cattle cross-breeding program highlighted
the situation. Firm action to ensure full Government conmitment to the
Project at that stage, could possibly have prompted MOA to take remedial
measures and some components should have discontinued, while others could
have been modified or strengthened.
7.11     Ouce again it is necessary to note that the unusual
circumstances imposed by the after-effects of the revolution from
1974-1979 resulted in,caution being adopted by all Government personnel.
The uncertainties and personal dangers of the times contributed most
importantly to i lack of decision-making.
7.12     Road maintenance received insufficient attention and action from
IDA.  It is now apparent that a lack of GOE funding for, and villager
participation in road maintenance has considerably reduced the benefits
of road construction under the project.
7.13     Closer MOA involvement in project execution and in assessing
effectiveness of project components should also have been insisted upon
by IDA.
Performance of Consultants
7.14     The appointment of consultants assisting with the Soil
Conservatinti Monitoring Study was delayed due to a lack of WADU/Ministry
administrative action in clearing and effecting their appointment.
Because of cement shortages and delays by the Infrastructure Division,
the civil works were not completed until 1980.  Only one full year of
run-off and silt load measurements were completed. Measurements from
that year are inaccurate because of apparent overdesign of the
hydrometric station, which must be adjusted for future usefulness. Also
agronomic, socio-economic and erosion data collected from the twin
catchment areas is disappointing. However, continuation of a consultancy
input in the soil conservation monitoring study is essential to obtain
the required information from the twin catchiment areas.  Preliminary
arrangements were made by RMEA with MoA to continue financing the study
under an ongoing Project.
VIIi.   Conclusions
8.0.     The objectives set out in the project appraisal were not
achieved; the expected incremental crop production may have been achieved
but cannot be quantified and projected incremental livestock production
was not achieved. The project is estimated to have had a negative rate



- 28 -
of return. The impact on land use and production from project activities
cannot be disaggregated from the impact of Land Reform.
8.02     The almost total absence of data on individual project component
costs and benefits, prevented management and IDA supervisions from being
able to evaluate and redirect the project. Where evidence suggested that
changes in programs were necessary, project management and the Ministry
of Agriculture were unable or unwilling to effect the necessary
modifications.
8.03     While infrastructure development was mainly completed in a
reasonable manner, cooperative development, extension, research and
studies, evaluation and planning components, which were the basis for
increased crop and livestock production, were not implemented as designed
at appraisal.
8.04     The project concept was based on conditions prevailing prior to
the revolution. In particular, land tenure, management aspects and terms
of trade changed significantly during implementation. In retrospect, the
consequences of the revolution on staff availability and on agricultural
and social policies had an adverse impact on a project which was not, and
could hardly have been designed to cope with such unforeseen circum-
stances. I/ Nevertheless, there is a more pertinent question: could
such an intensive agricultural development program have been successful
even with more favorable external factors? Also at that time, when the
project was designed in the early 1970s, was there still a place for
costly and complex integrated programs in Ethiopia's agricultural
development strategy? With the benefit of hindsight, the answers to both
questions are probably strongly negative. Lack of skilled staff and
budgetary resources and the complexity of the institutional and policy
environment in Ethiopia argued against such an approach. This had been
explicitly recognized in the design of the Minimum Package Program, which
was already underway when the project was being designed and processed. 2/
This is a lesson that is as relevant now as at the inception of the MPP
approach.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Calculations of Agricultural Impact and Financial Analysis
Crop Production
1.       Yields.  In this analysis average yield increments using inputs
are assumed to be:
Incremental Yield        Total Yield
maize             _               500 kg/ha              2,000 kg/ha
teff              -               200 kg/ha                650 kg/ha
cotton            -               250 kg/ha                500 kg/ha
The assumption of these average yields takes account of annual
yield variations due to climatic conditions, disease incidence and other
factors. It is, however, possible that the yields assumed understate the
actual yields obtained. There is good reason to be cautious since
farmers tend to apply fertilizers at lower rates than recommended, hybrid
maize seed is re-used, and plant densities (from low seeding and
germination rates) are much lower than recommended by research. Sales to
cooperatives could not be used as an indication, because of the
substantial sales to private traders, who offer better prices and
sometimes collect produce from farms.
Z.       Areas Cropped based on Inputs.  Calculations of project impact
are based on estimates of crop areas treated with inputs and ase-d
incremental production is attributed to the project.

1/ Total area is based on fertilizer use.

3.       Value of Incremental Production.  The lack of available data for
satisfactory impact evaluation has reduced the calculation of impact of
WADP-II on crop production to general estimates that rest on assumptions
of yields and areas cropped.

4.       There is no information available on cropping patterns, although
it is known that increased cultivation of land (new areas brought into
production) occurred as a result of the Land Proclamation Act of 1975.
Changes due to land refora or project activities cannot be segregated
because of a lack of baseline and annual crop and farm area data. There
is no evidence that the impact of WADP-II has resulted in the adoption of
new cropping patterns. It is possible that incremental production in the
district is higher because MOA personnel now consider the district mostly
a food grain export area, while it was importing food crops before the
project was implemented.
5.       Other Annual Crops.  The analysis, unfortunatly, must ignore
other crops that might have benefited from the WADU program, either
through the use of inputs, or as a result of improved cultivation
practices. For example, farmers are known to use some inputs on wheat.
The data base is too small to extrapolate the data any further than has
already been done.
Coffee Production
6.       Stumped Coffee Trees.  WADU has undertaken an extension campaign
to encourage farmers to stump (cutting old trees about 30 cm above the
ground) and prune low producing coffee trees to increase productivity
from new growth. Trees are stumped in January. Incremental production
is assumed to be 0.5kg per tree in the third year after pruning and 1.0
kg thereafter. All production is in dried, unshelled coffee. Half the
trees treated are assumed to give increased production. The value of
production is calculated on the basis of prevailing cooperative prices
which are based on national prices obtained from sale to coffee
purchasing authorities. Since most of the production from the project
area is believed to be handled by the Ministry of Coffee and Tea
Development (although considerable sales are made to private marketers
because of the shortage of coffee in Addis Ababa and other towns). Net
production foregone due to stumping has been assumed to be zero, since it
is the experience of extension workers that farmers stump only
unproductive trees.

7.       CBD - Resistant Coffee Trees.  The project has been raising and
distributing coffee seedlings of 11 CBD-registant and high yielding
coffee varieties since the 1979/80 season. Records of the seedlings
distributed and those surviving have been maintained by the Extension and
Training Division. However, yields from these varieties in the project
area are not known and neither are yields of the local varieties,
although some trials were conducted at Soddo and Dubo. All released
varieties have been yieLding from 2 kg to over 4 kg of dried unshelled
coffee per tree under research conditions. Local varieties are believed
to yield 1 kg to 2 kg of dried, unshelled coffee per tree, but are
extremely susceptible to CBD. Consequently, yields vary each year and,
even in a good year, CBD is present and reduces yields.
8.       Improved varieties of trees are therefore expected to yield at
least 1 kg of dried, unshelled coffee per tree more than local varieties,
even under the same traditional management conditions. These types also
begin to produce earlier, usually in the second season after planting.
However, even greater yield increases can be expected f om both stumped
trees and improved types if recommended managements practices of
mulching, manuring, pruning and spacing are adopted. Quality
improvements have also been generated by the project by picking only red
cherries and by drying on racks above ground. The following production
benefits have been assuaed:

Livestock Production
9.       Cross-breeding.  An estimated 20,000 cows per year were to be
crossbred with live Friesian bulls and by Al. By 1983/84 some 752 of
matings were to be by Al.
The expected benefits to the livestock program were:
(i) increased milk production by 6501 lactations;
(ii) increased animal offtake (by 51%) through:
(a)    50% to 70% calving rate increases;
(b)    250 kg to 400 kg offtake weight increase;
(c)    increased growth rate;
(d)    reduced mortality.
(iii)  stronger work oxen.
The components of this section of the program at Appraisal
included:
(i) cross-breeding using bulls at 20 bull stations;
(ii)  upgrading of the 20 bull stations;
(iii)  establishing an AI service:
(a)    train 14 inseminators;
(b)    inseminate increasing proportion at bull stations;
(c)    appoint 4 high level staff;
(d)    appoint 27 demonstrators/inseminators
10.      The impact was expected to take some time to accrue and the
&fftake increase is projected at 14,100 animals (2,500,000 kg meat) by
the end of the 12th year of the project. This would also mean an
increase in hides and skins available. However, only 2,896 live and 389
.I services have been given during the project.  Of these, some are
repeat services but the number is not known. No more than 2,500 calves
could have been produced from these. (Number of calves produced and the
success of crossbred cattle are not known). It is, however, clear that
whatever impact has taken place (or will take place in the future as a
result of these past crosses) is insignificant given the total cattle
population of the project area (estimated at 750,000). Of the 23 bull
stations only 10 were in operation with 14 bulls in Late 1981. It is
extremely doubtful that net benefits will accrue to the farmers in the
long run due to the additional problems of nutrition, fertility,
husbandry requirements and health imposed by the exotic blood.
11.      Health Services.  At appraisal, the project was to involve
continuation of the service began under WADU-I but with expansion:
(1)    greater diagnostic support services;
(2)    additional extension demonstrators;
(3)    11 vaccinators (as for WADP-I);
(4)    2 animal health assistants (as for WADP-I);
(5)    animal health officer; and
(6)    monitoring animal health.
The field service was to include monitoring, innoculation,
disease diagnosis and simwle treatments.  Dipping ls not mentioned in the
SAR and sheep and goats were not specifically included in the program as
outlined.



Annex 2

12.      WADU has concentrated successfully on the control of the major
infectious diseases as part of the national program.  No outbreaks of the
major infectious diseases of rinderpest, contagious bovince pleuro
pneumonia or foot and mouth disease have been reported in the last five
years. Trypanos#oniiasis in lowland areas and tick-borne diseases remain
the most important problems. WADU carries out a very limited clinical
service due to the high costs of such a program and to transport
problems. Little attention has been given to sheep and goats and no
systematic studies of animal diseases and their impact have been made.
13.      The project has constructed a well equipped laboratory but a
shortage of trained technicians and analytical chemicals has limited the
use of the laboratory to a negligible proportion of its actual capacity
(a Cuban technical assistant has been employed during the last few years
of the Project). Two dips have been constructed in lowland areas, mainly
in response to the incidence of tick-borne and skin diseases in crossbred
animals in Humbo. One of the dips is no longer functional. No
monitoring of the impact of the animal health activities of WADU has been
undertaken. Consequently the impact of the Project on animal survival
and production cannot be determined. Since the impact of disease control
is not monitored, "guesstimates" must once again be introduced to
indicate the possible impact of WAADU.
14.      One quarter of the net herd growth rate is assumed to be
attributable to disease control. The value of the incremental production
which results is expressed as annuaL sales of 4 year old cattle (average
price for male/female adult).  The incremental offtake and prices assumed
for livestock result in a conservative estimate of the impact of WADU on
livestock production in the project area.

'L5.     Soil conservation has produced one of the highly visible impacts of
{tbe WADU Project because erosion is often dramatic, and where rehabilitation
,has been effected the comparison is impressive. An estimate of the
Dincremental value derived from soil conservation are made. It should be
noted that most of the land selected for treatment by PAs is usually of very
low productivity.
The following are the most important achievements of the program:
Soil Conservation    -    31,511 hectares
Improved Drainage    -       6,120      "
Afforestation         -      3,975      t
14,627 trees
16.      Conserved Land.  The main methods of conserving land have been bund
construction, contour ploughing and strategic tree planting with adapted
species. The SAR provides an estimate of decreased production of 5% over 20
years from erosion on unprotected land with a 10-15% slope.  The gross
margin from traditional cultivation of double cropping of teff and maize
each fear is estimated to be at least B 66 in 1980/81 prices. It has been
assumed that the benefits from conservation of land commenced to accrue from
end of 1980/81. Benefits which might have accrued before 1981/82 would be
very small. The total gross value of production is estimated at B 1.040
million per annum (15,755 hectares x B 66 as only half the conserved area is
assumed to be used for crop production). Although the remainder would
produce benefits, at least in the form of livestock grazing, it has not been
taken into account in this analysis. The assumptions thus provide
conservative estimates of the value of the soil conservation component of
the Project.
17.      Drained Land.  It has been assumed that the drained land is used
for increased crop production and produces a single crop of maize each year
with a yield of 1,500 kg (i.e. traditional production without
improvements). Poorly-drained land is used by farmers for dry season
grazing, or for low yielding crops. The loss of the grazing value would be
offset by the forage value of crop residues. In addition, it is probable
that land is used more intensively than for a single crop each year. The
following benefits have been assumed:

18.      It is further assumed that half the drained area is used for crop
production. The benefits shown below are therefore likely to be somewhat

19.      Afforestation.  No monetary benefits are calculated for the
afforestation program. Trees are still young and will not be fully grown
and ready for cropping for another 7 to 8 years. However, the program has
the potential to produce very significant financial benefits for PAs and
cooperatives in the form of timber, extracts, by-products and fruit.

Financial Analysis
20.      A financial analysis has been completed for the project as a
whole by valuing as benefits the project impact on crop and livestock
production and soil conservation in financial terms, and IDA and GOE
contributions to the project as costs. The indirect costs of the project
- borne by the Government - have not been included as project costs.
Indirect costs include outstanding input debts, veterinary drugs, interest
on Ministry of Finance bridging finance and an allowance for Ministry of
Agriculture indirect costs.
21.      Benefits.  Valuation of project impact (benefits) has been given
in the preTedjng paragraphs and is summsarized in the table below; project
benefits are calculated as the financial value of crop and livestock
production and soil conservation.

Note: 1/ Residual impact after project completion.
22.      Estimates of benefits in each case rests on a number of
assumptions:
(i)   Annual Crops:  Impact of WADU is assumed to decline to nil
after the 1981/82 season if no further program activities
are undertaken;
(ii)   Coffee:  Stumped trees remain productive for 10 years
after commencing production and then decline again. Trees
of new varieties continue to produce for at least 10 years;
(iii)   Livestock:  Without the livestock disease control program
the benefits are expected to be lost very rapidly because
there will be no control of livestock movement, and
disease foci are present;

Page 9
(iv)   Soil Conservation:  Benefits fronm bunding and contouring
have been projected to accrue over the life of the
project. Drained land productivity is assumed to fall by
10% per year from 1982/83 (Year 8) without further project
intervention.
23.       Costs.  Project costs are the direct financial allocations made by
IDA and the Government to the project. The 1981/82 expenditures include
estimates of final IDA reimbursements and the outstanding costs that will
have to be borne by the Government. Indirect costs are not included.
Total costs are therefore summarised as:

Roads, water supply and other infrastructure development have
not been included because these will require maintenance expenditures,
and without the projection of these costs a salvage value has Little
meaning. Depreciated values could be used but are extremely difficult to
calculate. Finally, a proportion of the roads and water supplies are not
functional at present.
Calculation of Financial Rate of Return
25.      The financial rate of return is calculated using the cash flow
analysis. All transactions are expressed in 1980/81 values. A salvage
value has been included as a benefit in 1981/82. The heavy financial
commitments for the project and the assumed and calculated lower than
expected benefits result in a negative return of -5.63%.

26.      Common Factor for Discounting.  In order to calculate the
financial rate of return it is necessary to express all transactions at a
comnmon value since values prior to 1980/81 are calculated in the relevant
years; after 1980/81 all values are expressed in 1980/81 values.

ETHIOPIA
Second Wolaita Agricultural Development Project - Credit 486-ET
PROJECT COMPLETION REUORT
Performance Covenants
The implementation of the project is discussed here in relation
to the main performance covenants of the Credit Agreement. Only those
covenants for which performance was inadequate are considered.
Seczion 3.01: The Borrower shall carry out the project through
the Extension and Project Implementation Department of its Ministry of
Agriculture (hereinafter EPID-WADU), and with the assistance, inter alia,
of other appropriate agencies and instrumentalities of the Borrower with
due diligence and efficiency and in conformity with appropriate
administrative, agricultural, engineering and financial practices and
shall provide, promptly as needed, the funds, facilities, services and
other resources required for the purpose.
Actual: EPID was disbanded in 1970 and its functions
distributed to other departments in MOA. Little assistance was provided
by other agencies to WADU, and project direction and support from MOA was
inadequate, while the provision of funds by MOF was often late and
insufficient for satisfactory operation of WADU.
Section 3.02: The Borrower shall cause WADU to provide adequate
and appropriate staff, and such consultancy services as may be n cessary
to support it, for the purpose of the timely carrying out of the studies
included in Part (4) of the Project. The Borrower shall consult with the
Association to determine the staffing and consultancy services
requirements of the said studies, and the terms of reference therefor.
Actual: There were continued staff shortages at the higher and
middle level, and staff turnover was high. WADU and MOA were slow to
implement the soil conservation study and to select and finalize
arrangements with consultants. WADU did not carry out studies on land
use and farming systems in the project area. The studies for settlement
and ranching were not required after land reform in 1975.
Section 3.05 (a): (Subsidiary Loan Agreement) .... the Borrower
shall relend one millioti eight hundred thousand dollars (1,800,000) or
such other sum as the Association shall from time to time agree, to AIDB
for the purpose of financing the provision of seasonal credits under
Parts (1) and (2) of the Project for farm inputs in the Project Area.
AIDB shall provide the said seasonal credits through cooperatives and
WADU, under terms and conditions approved by the Association.
(b) The Borrower shall exercise its rights under the subsidiary
loan agreement in such manner as to protect the interests of the Borrower
and the Association and to accomplish the purposes of the Credit. Except
as the Association shall otherwise agree, the Borrower shall not assign,
amend, abrogate or waive the subsidiary loan agreement or any provision
thereof.



- 61 -                           Annex 4
Page 2
Actual: The Subsidiary Loan Agreement was not implemented,
although signed in 1975, as AIDB did not exercise its rights to draw down
funds and the Revolving Fund was not established.  AIDB did provide
seasonal credit gffor inputs through WADU and in December 1981 IDA
reimbursed US$ 5CZ,778 to AIDB under the appropriate DCA category
following '-he subtiission of an amended subsidiary loan agreement,
satisfactory to EDA.
Section 3.06: The Borrower shall cause WADU or AIDB, as the
case may be, to .elend co cooperatives and CMhCs in the Project Area all
funds necessary for the acquisition of cooperative stores and offices and
the equipment thereof, constructed or purchased under the Project, on
terms and conditions to be approved by the Ass.ociation.
Actual: WADU constructed the stores and bore most of the costs
thereof. At IDS ;nsistence WADU signed contracts with cooperatives for
up to 12 years at zero interest. The contracts provide for repayment to
WADU of half the construction costs of the cooperative stores.
Section 3.07: The Borrower shall cause WADU to adopt project
evaluation procedures acceptable to the Association.
Actual: An evaluation of the project was carried out by EPID in
1977/78 and again in late 1981 (by a consultant as the basis for
Government's PCR). The findings of the first evaluation were not
implemented and WADU did not effectively apply data collection,
monitoring and evaluation of its activities. Project benefits could
therefore not be accurately determined.
Section 4.01 (a): The Borrower shall maintain or cause to be
maintained records adequate to reflect in accordance with consistently
maintained appropriate accounting practices the operations, resources,
and expenditures, in respect of the Project, of the departments or
agencies of the Borrower responsible for carrying out the Project or any
pat thereof.
Actual: WADU accounts have been inadequately maintained and
accurate costings are not possible.
Section 4.01 (b): (Auditing of WADU, cooperatives and the
revolving funds and provision of audited financial statements within six
months of end of each financial year).
Actual:  The state of WADU accounts was such that, since
commencement, all audits have been heavily qualified. At the end of the
1980/8i FY audits to end of 1976/77 only had been prepared. Thereafter a
major undertaking was required by the Borrower to bring accounts and
audits up-to-date as IDA withheld reimbursements under Statement of
Expenditures (SOE) and for the construction costs for cooperative stores
under Category V of DCA. Following the audit of SOEs and all outstanding
annual accounts IDA, following some adjustments to disbursement requests,
resumed disbursements in September 1982.
Section 4.03: The Borrower shall cause WADU to prepare a plan
of work in advance of each fiscal year to be approved by the Borrower and
the Association, and shall advance to WADU at three monthly intervals
such sums as may be required to enable WADU to carry out the succeeding
quarter's portion of the said approved annual plan of work.



- 62 -                                  Annex 4
Page 3
Actual: Work plans and budgets were prepared each year but
often not in advance, and their approval by IDA was not always sought.
Work plans were not based on evaluation of effectiveness of past project
activities but on attempts te meet physical targets.
Funds were not advanced to WADU at three-monthly intervals by
KOF. A poor accounting performance by WADU and its inefficiency at
presenting reimbursement applications were stated as the main reasons for
altering the payment system. Also GOE's shortage of funds was at times
the constraining factor to adhering to the agreed system of WADU funding.
Section 4.06: The Borrower shall provide or cause to be
provided promptly as needed all funds necessary and take or cause to be
taken all other action as may be required to adequately maintaining the
roads and tracks to be constructed under the Project.
Actual:  This was not implemented.  At the end of December 1981
approximately 30% of all tracks and roads constructed under WADP-II were
not passable (a higher proportion would have been impassable in wet
weather). WADU and the District authorities have not adequately
organized villages for adequately maintaining roads, water supplies, etc.
Section 4.07. The Borrower shall cause WADU at all times to
employ qualified and experienced staff, and shall consult with the
Association prior to the initial or new appointment of the personnel to
the following positions in WA.DU: (i) Director; and, (ii) Heads of the
(A) Extension and Training Division, (b) Marketing and Credit Division,
(C) Finance Division, (D) Cooperative Development Section and (E)
Artificial Insemination Section.
Actual: WADU suffered from high turnover of senior and middle
level staff and long periods in which important positions were not
filled. This situation detracted from project performance. It was most
unfortunate that the original position of Deputy Director was abolished,
since the incumbent could have played a significant role in the
coordination of activities of the various divisions, sections and units
in WADU.
