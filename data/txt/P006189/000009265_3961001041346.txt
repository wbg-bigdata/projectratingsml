INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BOLIVIA
FORA SECOND PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OPERATION
1.   The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed credit to the
Government of Bolivia for SDR 8.5 million (USS11.3 million equLvalent) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with
40-year maturity and would be central to more efficient use of Bolivia's scarce
fiscal resources, eliminating inefficient public investments by making
transparent the financial results of the administration in general and of public
enterprises and investment projects in particular.
2.   Bagkoround. Bolivia"s itconomic crisis, which culminated in hyperinflation
of 24,000 percent in mid-1985, was fueled by the virtual nonexistence of a public
financial management system, which permitted an explosive growth of the fiscal
deficit and spurious financing of public expenditures.   The multiplicity of
antiquated and conflicting legal provisions governing public financial management
resulted in an arbitrary budgetary process; a complete vacuum of accounting
systems resulted in the absence of reliable financial data on the expenditures
and performance of public institutions; cash and debt management were based
solely on the availability of cash; and the audit control function resulted in
external pro-controls in which auditors interfered with the entity's managerial
process. The Paz Eutenesoro Government in September 1985 adopted bold reforms
designed to control inflation, cut the fiscal deficit, and restore external
balance. In parallel, it began a reform process of public financial management
to establish the financial information, administration and control systems
critical to efficient management and controlled use of public resources.
3.   IDA assistance in public financial management began in 1984 and culminated
in the approval of the Public Financial Management Operation (PFMO - Cr.1809-BO)
in December 1987. The PFMO, which is now fully disbursed, was successful in
establishing the overall legal framework and the foundation within the central
government for an integrated financial administration and control system. First,
the leaal lorovisions governing public financial management were replaced by a
single comprehensive statute, The Financial Administration and Control Law
(SAFCO). A budget formulation process based on the modern participatory approach
was designed with manuals and standards for program-based budgeting.   The
formulation process, however, remains over centralized, problems have
materialized in use of the new coding and classifications, and the Budget
Subsecretariat in the Ministry of Finance (MOF) lacks capacity to monitor budget
execution. In the area of Accountina, the General Accounting Office (GAO) was
established under MOF to promulgate accounting standards throughout the public
sector.   A short-term Emergency Program, introduced under PFMO, at present
provides aggregate statistics for the non-financial public sector, but a more
permanent integrated accounting system that has been created needs to be
disseminated more widely and harmonized with other existing systems. In the area
of cash manaaement, the responsibility has been consolidated into the Treasury
under MOP to transform the task into a management of budget execution. Further



work, however, is necessary on forecaoting cash flows, and cash management
procedures need to be extended to the decentralized institutions. In the area
of auditina, the SAFCO Law formally abolished the Comptroller-General's ox ante
control functions, thus ridding the system of its previous built-in incentives
for corruption. However, experienced auditors are in short supply, and external
control functions can be performed only when proper accounting systems are in
place. Internal audit guidelines have been produced, but further training is
required in their use.
4.   These reforms, though constituting only the first phase of improvements to
the system, have had measurable impact on public financial management, including
(i) eeduction of the budget deficit from 7.5% of GDP in 1987 to 0.8% in 1988
(enabling attainment of agreed IMF targets for 1989 and 1990); (li) production
of budgets that reflect Government's priorities in terms of expenditure cPilings
and entities's operational goalas (iii) public investment decisions based on
financial analysis of requesting entities; and (iv) closer monitoring of wage
bill increases by the Cabinet. The aggregate statistLces for the non-financlal
public sector produced under the Emergency Program have been crucial for public
expenditure planning and control and helped Bolivia to reach an agreement with
the IMF.
5.   in spite of the major progress achieved under PFMO, additlonal work Ls
needed to: (L) finalize the integration of the accounting system at the central
level; (ii) expand comprehensive accounting reforms to a select number of
decentralized public entities; (iii) broaden the scope of the financLal
administration and control systems at the center and disseminate them to benefit
decentralized '.nstitutions and local governments; and (iv) incorporate the
remaining non-financial public entities into the now financial management and
control system.
6.   Rationale for IDA Lendino.  IDA's involvement in the project is a logical
extension of Lts role in assisting the Government of Bolivia (GOB) to carry out
its strategy to resume an acceptable rate of growth. Apart from the basice of
maintaining  macroeconomic  stability  and  creating  incentives  for  prLvate
Lnvestments needed for growth, the main objective of the G08 agenda, and hence
IDA's assistance strategy, is to reorient the role of the state toward provision
of social and infrastructure services required for long-term development of the
country and promotion of necessary private investments, as well as to promote
efficient use of public resources to achieve the objectives of the newly deflned
role of the state. In this regard, supporting necessary reforms in the public
sector to create efficLent, transparent, and accountable institutLonal structures
and capacity is at the core of the IDA country strategy. More specifically, PFMO
II aims at enhancing GOB's financial management capabilities critical for policy
execution, implementing uniform and compatible guidellnes and procedures for
public financial management government-wide so as to ensure a more efficient use
of its scarce resoure"es.   This would be achieved through:  (a) expanding
comprehensive accoun .ng reforms to a selected number of representative
decentralized institutions; (b) broadening the scope of exlsting financial
administration and control systems to the local governments and decentralized
institutions; and (c) including other nonfinancial systems needed for efficient
allocation of resources.  The maLn objective of this effort is to create
financial management and control capabilitLes at the entity level, not only
wLthin the central ministries, furthering financial dlscipline throughout the
public sector. Furthermore, the proposed project would strengthen the capaclty



of the Comptroller General of the Republic to enforce accountability for results
in the exeroise of its public responsibilities.
7.   if succoeoful, this second IDA-assisted operation would go a long way in
strengthening GOB's capacity to manage efficiently its scarce resources and at
the same tlme increase accountability for cost-efflcient results in the public
sector. Thie would contrlbute to a leaner more efflcient state better able to
facLiltate and stimulate private sector development. However, publlc financial
management is not a function which can be permanently impro-ed through a
technical effort and good will in the short term. Its dynamlc requires permanent
attention and enforcement on the part of future BolLvLan governments before the
current admLnistrative culture can progressively absorb accountabllty principles
and procedures for the longer-term. It is expected that other international
donors, such as USAID and IDB and other bilateral assistance, would also help GOB
progress further in the future. IDA has expressed a longer-term commltment to the
continued improvement of public flnancial management in Bolivia.
8.  Proiect Obiectives.   The objective of the Project Ls to improve the
efficiency, effectiveness and transparency of the Borrower's resource management
system through: (i) institutionalLzation of program-based, cash, debt and other
resources, management and auditing procedures in eligLble public entities and
decentralized Lnstitutions; (il) enhancement of the institutional capacity to
implement such procedures, both at the Borrower's ceatral and local government
levels through the definition of standards and procedures, in particular, the
publlc disclosure, publicity, accountability and obligations of public servants,
that would enforce provisLons of the SAFCO Law;   (i$i)   strengthening the
capacity of COR and provision of ex-post control functLons in the Sorrower's
government, necessary for the enforcement of accountability for results in the
public sector; and (iv) development of skilled manpower to sustain such
procedures. Ultimately, the proposed project would contribute to enhancing the
efficiency of Lnternational donors' assistance and government' s institutional
capacity for the longer-term.
9.   Project VescrintLon.   The project would include three components:  (a)
financial manaaement to modernize accounting, budgeting, cash management in
Treasury, and government auditing norms and procedures at the central
administration level, including manuals and guidelines, and their disseminatLon
at all other levels;  (b)  standards and reaulatio, including review and/or
drafting of regulations called for by the SAFOO law in personnel management,
procurement, operation-programming and the rationalLzation of the non-financial
public sector; and (c) tXaLnLna to ensure a flow of high- and mid-level publLc
servants and other professionals competent in modern financial management and
auditing, responsible for the operation, dLssemination, enforcement, and
sustainability of the newly established norms and procedures. The project would
be implemented by three separate agencies, namely MP, CGR and the Training
Directorate in OCR, with overall coordination and directlon by ar. existing
project management unit under the responsibility of CONSAFCO, the also existLag
policy-making board for Bolivia financial administration and control, including
the Ministers of Planning and Coordination, Finance, the Comptroller General, the
Central Bank President, and the Accountant General of the Republic.
10.  Agreements Reached.    The following agreements have been reachedt  A.
overall Projects (a) the SAFCO Law will not be waived, abrogated or suspended
for the duration of the project; (b) any modifLcatlon to the agreed structures



of tho Ministry of Finance and the Contraloria General de la Republica would be
made in consultation with IDAI S. Implementatigns (c) CONSAFCO would maintain
for the duration of the project, its current composition (para 9), its Project
Management Unit and Project Director;  (d)  counterpart funds would be made
available by GOB through USAID's Economic Development Funds and this would be
included in annual government budgets; (e) that for the staffing of the 85 line
positions in MP and 23 within CGR included in the project, applicants would be
selected in accordance with norms and procedures acceptable to IDAt   (f)
biannual reports will be provided in February and August of every year, including
information on: (i) the number of entities lncorporated into the integrated
system, producing financial statements and reporting these to the GAO, (ii) the
number of entities producing their own budget submissions, and (iii) their
corresponding percantage contribution to the budget;  (g)  a summary of the
biannual reports would be presented tc Congress once a year in an integrated
fashion, before it reviews the budget, and would include a progress report on
implementation of the SAPCO Law; (h) a first annual work program (POA) for the
remaining months of 1991 has been agreed, based on what had been achieved to date
in each of the proposed program items; subsequently the POA would be submitted
to IDA by November 15, of each year for an exchange of views on what is
programmed as compared with what was achieved; (i) the Emergency Program staff
would be absorbed by the end of June 1992; and (j) exchange of views between GOB,
IDA and USAID in annual tripartite evaluations of achievements should be carried
out as a basis for reaching an agreement on the following year POAI the second
such review (1992) will be a comprehensive mid-term review to analyze
achievements against agreed upon measurable performance indicators and to
formulate corrective measures if necessary to improve implementation and outputs;
(k) the project and special accounts would be audited on an annual basis by an
independent auditing agency, acceptable to IDA, and would be submitted to IDA
within six months of the close of each fiscal year; C. Budaetina: (1) program-
based budgets to be fully operational at central government ministries and major
public enterprises by the end of 1992 and by Regional Development Corporations
by the end of 1993; D. Cash Nanaaement and Treasurys (m) changes in procedures
and structure of the Treasury would be achieved by the end of 1992: (n) the
private commercial banking network for cash transfers would be used starting no
later than June 1992; (o) a timetable, acceptable to IDA, for elimination of
subtreasuries would be submitted by the end of 1991 and actual implementation of
the agreed timetable achieved by the end of 19921 B. agountina: (p) GOB would
complete the developrient of an accounting system and implement it for each group
of entities as follows: (i) not later than June, 1993 in the 14 representative
decentralized institutions; (ii) not later than June, 1994 in the 116
decentralized institutions;  (iii)  not later than December, 1994 in the 58
decentralized institutions included in the Manual for Decentralized Institutions;
(iv) not later than June, 1994 for the adoption of existing Guidelines for Public
Enterprises by 50 enterprises of a smaller size;  and  (v)  not later than
December, 1994 for the development and implementation of simplified versions of
accounting, budgeting, and cash management systems in 90 representative smaller
local institutions (provinces, hospitals, educational centers and airports)  F.
Auditina: (q) the Contraloria General de la Republica would have established the
Technical Programming Office, the Legal Affairs Office and the Office of the
Deputy Comptroller and carried out other organizational adjustments by the end
of 1993;  (r)  an annual audit plan would be agreed with IDA by the end of
December yearly, so as to carry out systematic external audit of the public
sector central level entities by the end of 1993 and thereafter expand the
coverage of public sector at the decentralized levels; (a)  the Contraloria



General do la Republica will inform IDA of the key results of the "special
examinations" along with the response that the Government intends to give to the
corresponding findings; (t) the Deputy Comptroller General would have extensive
training and international experience in the application of general accounting
principles, auditing standards and management; and the General State Accountant
would have a strong background in management rystems for government financial
management; and (u) neither the Offices of the Comptroller General or of the
State General Accountant would cease to be independent entities throughout the
duration of the project.
11.  Benefits and Risks.  The main benefit of the project is that it will assiest
the Government to institutionalize the public financial management system
throughout the public sector to (a) improve the budget formulation process based
on coherent uniform public accounting and control systems; (b) provlde
instruments to integrate the overall financial status of the public sector; (c)
enhance the capacity to hold public servants accountable for their decisions and
actions through ex-post audit controls; and (d) develop a cadre of skilled
financial and audit experts to operate the system.
12. Three major project risks are (i) high turn-over of staff; (ii) ad hoc
changes in the financial management procedures; and (iii) lack of consistent
application of information generated by the SAFCO system to the Government's
decision-making process. The staff turn-over, caused mainly by low salaries and
high private sector demand for skilled manpower (e.g. accountants, auditors), is
being addressed through the establishment of the Public Sector Management Scheme
where civil service conditions of pay and employment are being adjusted to
compete with the private sector. In regard to the ad hoc changes in orocedures,
it was agreed with the Government during the negotiations that all institutional
and procedural changes regarding the SAFCO system would be made after
consultation with  IDA.   While the  largely political risk regarding the
Government's possible disregard of SAFCO-generated information in its decision-
making process cannot be entirely mitigated, specific actions would be taken to
reduce this possibility. It was agreed at negotiations that (a) annual reports
would be submitted to Congress on the progress of implementing the SAFCO Law,
thus ensuring that Government policy-makers would be aware of the available
information; and (b) satisfactory review of project implementation and of the
following year's work program on an annual basis would be a condition of
continued IDA financing.
13.  Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreements of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.
