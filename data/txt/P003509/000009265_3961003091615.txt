TH SECTOR
A. SECTOR BACKGROUND
6wal
1.1          China has a rapidly growing urban population of about 300 million, larger than
the total population of the United States. Although about 70 percent of China's 1.1 billion
populaton lives in rural areas, emigration from the rural areas accouns for most of the recen
rpd urba growth. 'here are now more ta 150 cities with populations of at least 200,000
sad thouands of smaller towns. Even though compared to other developing countries the
ren urban growth rate in China is low, it is China's size which makes the development of
uban infrastructure, in particular, for water supply and pollution control, an Immense taslc
1.2          Over the past 400 years China has been a country where survival of its people
ws closely linked to water. The location of large umbers of its population along its
rourses meant tht they were constniy thratened by severe droughts or catastrophic
floods and epidemics of waterborne diseases. China has over the centuries developed a culture
of hygienic habits which have dealt well wfith the disease rsks related to water consumption and
ation. The introduction of modern urban water supply and sewage collection systems would
Orher conute to improvement In the health status of the population.
Wat  Resources
1.3          RaIl is bigbly variable over China's extended territory, resulting in marked
dIfee        in availability of water resources. China's mean anmnal rainfal ranges from
2,400 -m to less than 25 mm. The central and northest regions have a mean annual rainfal
in the range of 400-1,000 mm, while the northwest half of the country receives less than
400 mm in the average year. Ite rainfal pattern in densely populated eastern China is
domnated by the southeast monsoon. Although China is reported to have more thu 50,000
rivers, only 1,580 have catchments greater tham 1,000 km2 and only 79 exceed 10,000 km2. The
m   anmnul runoff from the total land surface is about 2,600 biBlion ni. In all cases the runoff
is highly seasonal, with most occuring in late spring to early auum
Wat Supply
1.4          China has made considerable progress in harnessing its rivers and in construing
water supply systems for its urban populations. In 1949 there were only 59 cities with water
supplies with a total capacity of 2.4 mDilon m&/day, providing water to only 9 million people.
in 1986, 302 cities had potable water supplies with a capacity of about 42 million m3/day. To
this sbould be added the water supply developed and used by idusties with a capcity of about



-2-
63 milion mslday. t Is esmed tbat now pracdcally all major cites (353) have water supply
systems which provide, mostly througb hous connections, the minimum necessay supply of
Wa teO their populatios and Industry.
1.5          Watr supply covege In small (county towns) ks markedly differet. In 1989
it was rpntd that only 26 pecent of those towns (3,068 towns) had water supply facilites,
seving about 50 million people. The cover  rates in those towns are still low-ranging from
27 to 73 pe, with         tin rates from 17 to 60 lcd. With the rapid in
aking place  ughout Chia, water available from the piped systems in both large and small
towns i ofte  indeqat ad indutries awe compeed to develop their own supplies or
conute heavfly to the onuction of public system. Only about 30 percent of the rouly
770 mlion rural population has adequate water supply. The recently approved Rura Water
Supply and Sanitation Ptoject focuses on this sector (Credit No. 2336-CHA, approved 1992).
Poluon Control
1.6          China's traditional system of nigbtsoil collection in the cides graualy h being
replaced by piped sewage collection systems which appear to be deficient in terms of design,
construction quality and maintenance. China has used nightsoil as agricultural fertilizer for
ceuries and hygienic practices of the general population have dealt atsfactorly with risks of
disease related to this method of domestic waste disposal. However, the use of nightsoil by
fame  i less in demand now due to the widening use of chemical fertlizers and an increasig
reuctane to handle nightsoil. Also, many industries have some form of treatment for their
wastes but few of these systems are operated efficiently. I'he more troublesame aspect of the
present siion is that Industral waste dischrges, Including metallic and toxic chemical wastes,
are very often mixed with domestic wastes. These wa_twaters are then either spread on
amad or form part of irrigation water, with the risk that some of the comtients may ente
the food chain. In many urban areas, sewage is discharged unted to the neaest watercorse,
with assimilative capacity being exceeded in many localized reaches of stream  and rnrs. In
addition, treatment acilities for domestic and indusi sewage are either absent or grossly
Inadequate in most cides.
B. SECTOR   SmunONs
1.7          Ihe Changau Municipality was recedtly elevated to an independent economic
planming uniL Municipal governments in China have much greater responsibilities compared to
cities in other oountries, because in addition to the service functions of a Municipality in
industrial countries, they are also responsible for productiv enterprises such as those for
construction and manufacturing. For example, in Changchun the municipal government consist
of S Commissions (Planing, Urban Constuction, Foreign Trade, etc.), 42 Bureaus (Machine
Idustry, Chemical Industry, Agriculture, Public Health, etc.) and the Courts. The daly
opaions of the municipality are managed by a large management team consistng of a Mayor,
an execuive Vice Major, six Vice Mayors and a Secretary General.
1.8          Ihe Cetal Government has decentraized most of the funcdons relating to urban
management to the provinces and municipalities. As a rest, Central Goverment functions in
these fields nDOw are limited to the provision of broad policy and tehnical guidance and sanction
of major investmaent projects; all urban projects exceeding Y 200 million stil reuire  roval
of the relevant technical ministry and the State Planning Commission (PC). Because of ths



-3 -
tole chage and because most project financing    no  unde the control of the local
govemen=, the central thical ministries have a limte role in the munipal dociion-
mrlng process.
1.9          lh. Minstry of Construction (MOC) is the agency responsIble for urb/region

C. MAOR SECmRAL TSU
1.11         During the 1960s and 1970s China's Ceiral Government coned  on
idstrialization in u     areas, but left urban services neglected. AldMugh in the past decade
Chinas cities and towns have Invested considerable reources to improve the water supply and
santation sectr, the sector will need to cote lrge-scalo investment for the foreseeable future
to sustain economic growth and impro  iroment quality. Carefl nvestm    plain
with prudent selection of invesent priorities are theref  critical issues (see paras. 1.19 and
1.20). linasingly, the sector investments will need to be funded fiom local resources, and
thereore, upgading of local government and utility finaing i another area of critical
1.12         Whilo ther is reognition at various levels of govenme  of eXcessivO water Us
by industry, me_ares to convert ma   ng processes to consere water are often costy.
To address the sitution, Chinese citie re curtly setting wae use quotas for various
industries, with heavy financial penaldties for exceding the quotas. The rles for quot levels
are, however, arbitrarily defined, and the penalties charged do not reflect rsource cost.
Formalization of a policy to tie these charges to the marginal cost of watr productio  and
distrbion will be needed to ensure economical use of water. Reaistic comumption levels on
this basis could then be obtned to pride a more reasonable base for cities to plan their water
splies.

1.13         In most cities, municipal water supply s organized as a muicipal deprtm
or water spply omp    under the Municipal Public Utiity at Uba Construction Bus.
FN   authorty is wtb the mayor or one of the vice-mayors. Many resitios  ist which
mpeo the operationof te water supply enttas a true public utity. For ample, they do
ot have fnadal autonomy and are dpdat on the municipaity for long-term plnning,
capital ilnv ent, settin waer rates, tratment of surplus eang and meetin operational
deficits. To Improve perfrmance In the urban water supply subector, there needs to be
delegaion f great opratil autonomy to the water supply companies, together with stricter
fhicW  dscipline and accounability. An established water supply company operating on a
well-orgni, efficient, commercial basis must be assured when consideration Is given to
panslon of watr supply services or Inoduction of water pollution control facilities. OnDy In
jl way can cost revy and oper-aional objectives be certain.
1.14         Th    ea    demand for water pollution cool will need to be folowed by
the establi    of autonomous sewerage utilities. At present municipl sewae sytm  ar
mosly mnaged by municipal constuction dartments. As long as there are no sewage
tratment plans operated by those mnmicipalities, from a technical point of view, it is logical to
include the mintenance of sewage systems with the general road mainece. The construction
of ewage tratment plants, however, requires efficient operation and mainteace of these plas
and the control of pont discharges into the sewage collecton system, especially from Industry.
The management of !he billing and collection of sewerage charges would be most efficient if
handled by the water supply companies.
1.15         NEPA and the prolcial and municipal Enviromnl Protection Bureaus
(PBs), as wel as Urban Construction Commissions (UCCs), have established guidelines and
rl   s on quantty and quality of industral effluent discharged to sewers or to watercourses.
However, it is often politically too difficult for these agencies to deal with large industties which
in many cases noe the major pollutrs. Thus, pollution abatement measures, such as the levylns
of dcares based on effluent quality and quantiy, have ofte not been effective. The charges
have frequently been forcibly depressed so that polluting industries opt t continue to pay the
chages rather thaD take appropriate measues to reduce pollution. Most provincia goverments
are aledy aware of the need for environmental protection, and some measues are already being
taken There is an urgent need to strengthen and equip EPBs and UCCs, and to trdn their staff
to carry out their fumctions more effectively.
1.16         Very large investments wil be made in the water supply and sewerage sectors
in China over the next decade and beyond. It can be assumed dat the urban popuation now
served with water supply and sewerage systems is about 120 million and tat this should increase
w 600 million (ess than 50 percent of the totad Chine  wopulation) by 2010. This is an increase
of 480 million people to be served. A minimum Investment of $150 per person to be served,
would imply an investment of $72 billion over 20 years, or roughly $3.6 billion per year. In
the Implementaion of such a large program, there Is potential for wasting of resources. Ihere
Is a need for ineased  peraatng efficiency and improved construction practices and operation
and           . Iiherefore, there is a requirement for betetr sector analysis and policy
formlation, techical as wefl as financial, which would lead to rational priodization of
investmenlts.

E. ROLE OF Tm  BANK GROUP  IN =E SEcroR
1.19         Ihe Bank/IDA sees its principal role as fosterig a continug dWogue on sector
issues and Wtions, thereby supporting and implenting the Central Governments
decentraiztion strategy and delegaion of responsibility for the prvision of water supply and
sanitation services tc municipalities. ITe Bank Group's apprach ams at the creation and/or

1.20         Sufficient experience has been gained tough Bank Group inesmet In hoe
sector to date to prepare a comprehensive analysis of secora issues. The Cental Governm
and the Bank Group are planming sudies to prepare Provcial Sector Development amd
Investnt Plans during 1993. Such studies would have a regiona focus and be caried out in
one or two provinces initially, with particular attention given to cost recovery and opatonl
efficiency issues. The studies would produce comprehensiv sector rports whih would include
a siuation analysis, a sector development strategy, and a fiamewok for investment plans. They
are expected to be the models for other provinces to use to develop sound strategies and bases
for future sector investments. These plans also will pwvide guidance to the Central Governme
on sector issues and form the strategic framework on which future policy and investment
decisions can be based, as well as servig as a coordinaion instubmn for the mobilizadon of
donor sance to the sector.

PROJECT AREA
A. UWAN GROW AND ECONOMC ACmm
2.1          Chaugchun Municipality has an area of 18,880 km. Ihe area DOw covered by
the City of Changchun is pproximately 107 mw and  preed to grow to 150l  k  by the
year 2000. Major expansion is expected In the south and southwest parts of the city with less
epasion possible in the east and the west. Due to family size limions and control on city
size in ChiUs, the population of Changchun has grown at a modest amnal rate of 1.5 percent
during 1985-90. The population of 1.8 million in 1990 is esdmated to grow to 2.1 million In
the year 2000, with an esimated annual populaion growth rate of 1.5 percent, deasang to
0.7 percent between 2001 and 2010.
2.2          Cbangchun depends on its industry for economic growth. In 1985 Industry
accounted for almost 85 percent of the cits GDP; in 1990 it rose to 91 percent Producvt
of the light Industries is slowly gaining momentm   I  1990 light Induty conited
47 percent to. the city's Industri GDP, and in 1991 almost 55 percent. Cumenty over 3,400
factories and enterprises are located throughout the city and include truck, tractor, bicycle,
railcar, Instrument, chemical, pharmacical products, texffiles and food factories. For example,
an automobile manufactring plant (VW) is currendy under construction and scheduled to
produce 100,000 units per year in 1995. The long-term plan for the city, as approved by the
Centra Govermment, encourage industial development in three major areas: (a) automobile and
trsportlagrlcultural equipment manuf g, (b) food processing industries, and (c) high-
tecnology industries serving (a) and (b).
B. REAMAL AND INDUSThIAL WAMR SUWLY SERVICES
2.3          Within the built-up area of the city, which is the service area of the Cangchun
Water Supply Company (CWSC), most of the residential, instiutonal ad IustrI users are
served by two water treatnent plants located within the city. The water dItbuton system
consists of about 220 km of trun mains (300 mm to 1,000 mm), and many smaller (ess tha
300 mm) distribution mains which branch from the truak mains. Due to corrosion, low-quality
pipe materid, poor Joints, and lack of system maintenance, unacuted-for water is estimated
to be about 20 percent of total water production. The act  status of unconted-for water is
difficult to quantify; 40 percent of CWSC's customers remained umned in 1992. Ihere were
6,000 commerial connections, of which 40 percent were metered and 2,500 huIustrI
coectins, of which 72 percent were metered. The extg water supply system is deribe
in Annex 1.
2.4          Although the city is highly indu.1rialized, it is situated in a water-short region.
Throughout much of Changehun's recent history, water supply has been unable to keep pace



-8-
with ncreasing domestic and indusial demand (see AMU-Water Demand and Sewag
Forecasts, Figre 2).
2.5         Industry is expected to grow rapidly, both in the mmber of establsbmen  as
well as in production output. In recent years, growth in both industrW and domestic wae
demand have been equal (about 35 percent each). ITe remainder represenmt   stitutioa
commercial demand. However, with already approved expansion of industry and the
inrouction of new activities, this proportional split is eWpected to chnge, wh Industy
acounting for about 46 percent of demand by 1997 and residenial demand acounti  fo
32 percent.
2.6          Resictions on water supply have been imposed on both industria and dometc
consumption, and availability of water supply wfll continue to cOnDStr  Consution   t
the present proposed project and beyond. It is eated that the production capacity in the city,
approximaely 409,000 m3/d, fell short of demand by about 50 pecent in 1991. By 1995, ths
shortfall is expected to increase to 60 percent. In 1991 the shortfaUl of water available for
insttutdonal use was estimated to be 4.2 million rm'. The average anmial water shortage in the
industria sector since 1985 has been about 4 million mi. Table 2.1 mmm the waW
demand projection through the year 2000.

C. WATER SUPPLY MASER PLAN
2.7         In 1988 a feasibility study for a Changchmn Water Supply Project was completed
by he  locd design instiu  (Jilin Hydraulic Exploration and Desig Institute; Chin Nothest
MunicW  Design Ibstitute; and Changchun Exploration Desig Inste). At the suson of
IDA in December 1989 and during the following preparation phse, the proje eanded fom
a sw    imestme project for water producdon for Cbangmn to a opei
action and investme  plan in water supply and pollution control for the cit. As a resul, a
feasibility study was undertak  by international consultants funded by the Canadian Inteational
Development Agency (CIDA). Through these studies, a long-term detaied Water Supply Mter
Plan was developed and priority investments identified for Changehun Municipality.   e
iwesMint proposals included additional water tanmission mains, water treatment and



-9 -
distribution facilities; institutdonal developmet to strengthen the wsr  supply was also
recommended.
D. R     NA  AND INusruS IA SEWAGE DSwoSAL
2.8           Approximtly 40 to 50 prcet of the city is seced by swers. Historicaly,
the sewe system in Changchun was developed in the various drinae are  using the shortest
rout, to discharge Into the streams, rivers, ponds or drainage cou    within the cky. Some
sewers, particularly those in the predominantly indust  easter area of the city, date to the
1930s. About 67 percent of the sewers were built prior to 1940. Much of the sewage collecon
system (60-70 percent) is in poor condition due to lack of mainteance and repair. In the older
of the nine drainage districts of Changchun, combined sewer systems conveying domestic,
industri and stormwater flows are common, with newer oonstion incoporatng separate
sanitary and storm sewers. The sewer system consists of about 324 km of combined sewers,
243 km of storm sewers and 212 km of sanitary sewers. In 1988, a 3.2 km inteceptor sewer
of 1,800 mm and 2,200 mm concrete pipe was Installed in the bed of the Ytong River from
Yongan Bridge to Dongda Bridge. This interceptor sewer cmrently discharges raw sewage int
the Yitong River, downstream of the Dongda Bridge, at a tempormy lowlift sewage pumping
staton. A more detailed description of the exting sewerage system and industial waste
disposal practices is given in Amex 1.
2.9          The large industrial and population conceon, together with a lack of
effective intrvention by Changehun Municipality, has cased srious water pollution problems
in the receiving waters of the city. Most sewage is disbarged untred to the Yitong and
Xina Rivers. The situation is most severe In the Yitong River immedaty downseam of the
city core. Only one small, mixed domesticindstrial, treament pla of the No. 1 Auto Plant
is being opaed. In the 1960s a primary teatment plant was built in the northeast area of the
city, wih the intenon of reusing treated water f   rigation. For unknown reasons this plant
was hardly ever used and is in a condition of total disrepair.
2.10         An analysis of the existing situation indicates ta the ratio of sewage to water
supply is about 0.8. This factor was applied to the projected water supply (by use category) to
project the sewage volume. Table 2.2 summaizes sewage generation from 1990 to 2000.

E. SEWAGE DISPOSAL MA.¶ PLAN
2.11         Because of the lack of existing sewage collection and treatm    faci, the
achievement of full sewage treatment objectives will req     the establihment of a well-
mlWing sewerage entity, and large investments. Mierefore, a Swge Disposal Mast Plan
for Changchun was prepared by international consultants (para. 2.7). The Maser Plan
recommends a 20-year program of investments for trunk sewers and tratment faciities. A
phased approach is proposed with implementation over a relatively long period of dme
(approximately 20.30 years), to resolve the many interrelated problems. Phase 1, which wM
be addressed by this project, will lay the base for the implementation of such a strategy. The
project lso will provide the first physical works of the program, indcting constuction of an
Interceptor sewer and a major primary sewage treatment plant on the Yitong River downsteam
of the city. Operational data need to be gathered from monitring the primary treatment facility
to be able to design the secondary treatment plant in the second phase of impl i
2.12            A number of other activities were also proposed, including the establishmen
of a Changchun Sewerage Company (CSC), creation of industri estates, separation of housing
from work places, development of a hazardous waste management program, including a diposa
site, and the establishment of an effective regulatory and enficement framework. Ihe estimated
cost of priority urban sewerage investments was about Y 275 million ($50 million).
F. PUBC HEALTH
2.13         Public healdt in Changchun Municipality is generally good. Since the 1970s,
there have been only isolated and localized occurrences of typhoid and hepatis B (and some
fluorosis). The Government places a strong emphasis on disease prevention, spending about
Y 1.0 million per year on immunization programs specifically aimed at typhoid and hepatitis B.
in additon, schools offer extensive health education with emphasis on good hygiene and
sanitation practices. Gastrointestinal diseases are of some concem, but they occur mainly during
the summer monts and are thought to be caused by a number of reasons, not all related to the
ciy's sanitauy conditions. Nonetheless, there is the potential for serious public health problems
in Changchun, particularly given the growing populaion, inadeqacy of extg  water and
sewerage systems, and ongoing industi expansion.

THE PROJECT
A. Pztojcr OBVES
3.1          The project objectives are to:  (a) Improve water supply in Changchmn
Muoicipality to met the domestic needs of the urban populaton and to support industial
growth; (b) reduce industra and domestic water pollution through physical wors, strengthening
of ins"tions, development of reguations, improvements in operational management, and
changes in pricing policy; and (c) create a first demonstration project, where the lessons leared
can be shared with other municipalities in Cbina (paras. 1.11-1.16.  The instiutional
strengthning objective aims at assisting Changchun Municipality in establishing appropriate
sector institutions, policies and regulations. The present organization of wate supply and
seweage services is fragmented among planning ad design, construction, and opeaions and
mainteace (O&M) and is distributed among several municipal agencies. Ihis has created
major problems of coordinatio The project supports the concentration of comprehensive water
supply activities in the CWSC, with a similar plan being proposed for the recendy established
CSC. These actions should encourage more efficient use of water resources, more prudent
investment decisions, and strengthen the planning and operational capabilities of CWSC and
CSC.
B. PNoJcr DESCR]PnON
3.2          The project is aimed at improving the existing water supply and sewage disposal
systems for Changdhun. The existing water supply capacity will be expanded from the present
438,000 m3ed to 794,000 me/d at completion of the project in 1997, whfle a central sewage
treatment facility capable of providing primary treatment for the city will be constucted. The
water supply service coverage is planned to be increased from 90'percet to 97 percent during
the project execution period.
3.3          The proposed physical works for the water supply project include the
constuction of transmission facilities to convey water from the Second Songhua River to
Changchun via the Chalu River and the Shitoukoumen Reservoir, construction of pumping
station at Maja, Tunshansi, Dasui, Shiteukoumen Reservoir, and Xinlicheng Reservoir,
construction of Water Treatment Plant No. 3 and temporary upgrading of Water Tream Plan
No. 1, construction of supply and distribution system water mains in the City, and technical
ssistnce (TA) to upgrade the technical, administrative and operationmintenance sills of
CWSC to steamline the existing stcture into a more efficient and effective operat  company.
3.4          The proposed physical works for sewage disposa and environmental pollution
contol include the construction of an interceptor sewer and a primary treament plant, and
pwrcrment of eqipmet and instruments for water pollution monitoring. The primary

rates have been used: for local expenditures, 6.0 pecent for 1993 tough 1998; for fo1re
expendIures, 3.7 pecent for 1993 through 1998.
E FINANCaNG PLAN
3.10         Ihe proposed IDA Credit of $120 million equivalent would fnce about
50 percent of the project costs, exclusive of land acqui on  cost and interest durn
consruction. Other sources of financing include the Central Governmen, Juin ProvincIa
Government, and Changchun Municipality.  The Cental Govenment, lJin Pmvica
Government and Changchun Municipality confirmed to IDA their agreem    on sha  of project
fuing as equit contribudons. The financing plan for the project is smmuized in Table 3.2.
The Changdum Municipal Goverment should not have any problems in meedng its share of
project cost. CMG will conttibute an average of Y 36 million per yea wit high contation
of Y 55 million in 1996 and Y 49 million in 199S. This is well witin the city's normal capital
spending. The city plans to spend a total of Y 177 mlion in 1996 and Y 161 mflion in 1995
for capital construction.

3.11         Changchun Municipality has agreed to increase the water tariffs to take efect
as of Jamuary 1, 1993. This increase is necessary to help fane the project Changchun
Municipality provided IDA with evidence that the tariff increase has been apprwved, and will be
implemented with effect from January 1, 1993 (par  5.10).
3.12         As a result of increases in project costs over earlier estimts, the municipality's
share has also increased. Changchun Municipality has provided IDA with a schedule, acceptable
to IDA, of the funding contributions and schedule of disbursements from the municipality for
1993-95.
3.13         The IDA Credit would be made to the Centr Govenmen on staxard terms
for a duration of 35 years, including 10 years grace. The proceeds of the Credit wodd be
onlent to Changchun Municipalith- to be repaid over 15 years inciuding 5 years of grace at an
interest rate of 5.1 percent per annum. The municipality would onlend the proceeds to the newly
created CSC at similar terms and to CWSC at a vaiable rate equal to the Bank rate plus a spread
of 1.5 percent per annum. CWSC and CSC wfll bear a fixed commitment charge of 0.5 percent

F. PROjCr MANAGEMENT AND IMmnTTON
3.14         Project implementation is the direct responsibility of the Qangchun Water
Supply and Environmena Project Mangement Office (PMO) located in CWSC, and wil etend
fiom 1993 to 1998. lbe PMO was established on March 19, 1992 and appears to be fuctionng
well. It reports to the High-Level Leadership Group (HLLG) under the Chargchun Municipal
Goverment, under fte direction of the Mayor, three Deputy Mayors and 11 Bureau Directors.
The m_as of CWSC and CSC are also included in this group. The Senior Engine of the
North East Design Institte Is the PMO Manager. A Chief Finance Officer (CFO) has been
3ppointed and a plan for PMO stffing and acilities has been submitted to IDA. The Chief
Finance Officer and key finance staff will be on deputation from the Changchun Finace Bureau
to failitate fancial functions. Ihe PMO will execute the project, and supervise and monitor
al con tr   and mainin the project records, including the original copies of all contracts and
puchasing documents. It wil operate on behalf of CWSC and CSC under writ  ageemen.
uances were obtained that the Changehu Murlcaly wUI mainain the PMO with staffg
andfactes acceptable to IDA. Because CWSC and CSC have not undertaken such a large
cnstruction project in the past, they will be assisted by consultants to be retained under terms
and conditions acceptable to IDA. The PMO has prepared a satisfactory project construction
supervisionplan, includingstaffing. Maininingthe PMO, with stg and facilities acceptable
to IDA would be required during Implementaion of the project
3.15         Day-to-day construction supervision wiUl be provided by local consulting
egieers assistd by foreign consultants. 'Te consultants' duties include verification of
compliance with specifications for works and goods, supervision of constuction, tesig and
commissioning of completed works, advice on training of staff to operate the completed
facilities, and preparation of documents for procuring treatment plant equipment.
r"ject Rept
3.16         Under the project the PMO will be requtred to prepare and submit to DA
quarterly progress report. CWSC and CSC wil be required to prepare a year-end rpor
swnmarldng each conpy's actiies during the year, as well as semannual summay reprs
on the main deweopments and changes In the corporate plan.
G. LAMD ACQUismon
3.17         Land wil need to be acquired for construction of the water ransmission line,
water treatment and distrbution facilities, and sewage treatment plant. The PMO is in the
process of acwuring the 98 ha of land for construction purposes and another 448 ha on a
tmporary basis for the project Out of this, approximately 428 ha is needed for the watr
tnsmission line, 8 ha for the water treatment and distrbution facilities, and 60 ha for the
swge treatment site. The land is manwly used for agricultura purposes. Where wors are

Changchun Municipality in eariy 1992, using the eisting staff employed in the municipal
seweag services.
B. ORGAnI N AN MNAGMNT OF CWSC A  CSC
4.5          The Municipal Face Bureau, Ru   and Urban Construcdon Commision ad
the Municipal planning Commission sprvise   e Municipa Bureas ad Companies and
establish policies and budgets, and approve capital exp_a. CWSC and CSC mst
proposals are submitted by thei resective bureaus to tie Face Bureau ad Plamning



-20-
Commisson ifor review. The proposals ae then passed on with r endons to the Mayos
Offlico and the local Peoples Cone. The Price Bureau and the Finance Bureau must approve
iffnaes.
4.6          CWSC has agreed to adopt a new organiaton and responsibiiftes by
Decmber 31, 1994 &a. 4.9). lhe new arraUgement esembles the defnion of an urban
watr supply utility in the Iuialized world, with most components of the opeaton  nd
mahame sevice under the authority of CWSC  magement. Even though, in tem  of
Interatial practice, the newly acquired autonomy and responsibflities of CWSC is standd
br Idustriized counries, it is a recent concept for China. As such major changes demand
attitude chnge, implementation of the new organization and application of its newly won
management authority can take place only gradually.
4.7          CWSC's new o ional strucue should provide beter commnication,
clearer lines of responsibility. It should also reduce the General Manager's direct operational
responlities, whfle increasing his effective control through middle line managers. Figure 1
in Annex   shows the structre which has been agreed with CWSC to be implemene by
December 1994. Under this structure, CWSC will have five D Managers rporting
directly to the General Manager.
4.8          lhe objective of the newly formed CSC Is to collect, treat and dispose of all
sanitay sewage in Changchun, and to collect and divert stormwater in the Changehun drainage
bain away from developed areas, thus reducing flood damage. CSC would meet the statory
requirement and crteria set by the EPB and the policies of Changchun Municipality. CSC will
be developed with seven departments, reporting to a General Manager. Its objectives, stucture
and respnibilities are described in detail in Annex . The formation of CSC represens a major
strentheningof Changchun's capacity to Improve sewerage operations, in tem  of management,
decision making, and operations and maienmce.
4.9          Much of the dayD-tday contact with water conumers is through CWSC's distict
offlces. Tbis includes both service and commercial matters. This will be equally importan to
CSC. Assrances wre obtalned that CWSC and CSC wUl engage consutasu, by Decmber31,
1993, wt Terms of Reference and agreed acdonplan and timing (Aw.LV accpable to IDA,
to work out a plan to improve the management and operations, in particua the district
operat , and to upgrade the physical facilities of these offices as well as to purchase
ewipmet as part of the technical assistance under the project. By December 31, 1994, both
coaanes wilprovide IDA wth hs acton plan, In aform acctble to 1DA. This together
with th  abilitation and new works should improve distribution system and sewage collecton
system management, and result in less costy and more energy efficient services.
C. ACCOU?M    AND AUDrnNG
4.10         CWSC keeps its accounts on a double-entry accrual basis. I is one of only two
water cpanies in China to have a Class 2 accountng classificadon (the other is Beijing). No
water company has a Class 1 raft, the highest raing. Under Chinaes ongoing reform program,
new accounting standards that more closely resemble Western accounting praices are scheduled
to become effective in 1993. CWSC wll modify its accountng system to provide reports to
meet Ch        reporig and Western accountig standards. CSC will set up a similar system.
Project fimds wil be used to povide necessay technical assistan  and purchse computers to



-21 -
implemet the now systems. The Project Office wll keep all project accounts and suppordng
documents. As with other IDA-finced projects In China, projct accounts will be maintd
in accordance with the State Construction Unit ccountn sysm.
4.11         The Changchun Finance Bureau and the Changehun Audit Buren, units under
the hIlin Provincial Audit Burea, perform audits of CWSC's accuns. However,.thr Is no
reuar annual audk. Assurances have been obtied utha annu  audts of (a) project accus,
(b) te CWSC and the CSC accouns, (c) the Specil Accout, and (d) the Samentr of
EWenditure (SOEs) wi be carried out by auditors acceptabl to IDA and conq*e and sew
toIDA withn sLr months ofthe end ofeach fiscalyear.  hefonmats afthe accounts ad audJts
also will be subject to IDA's reWew and aproval. The Foreig Investm Audit Dept
of the State Audit Adminion wil be responsible for anmnal audits in the same manner as
other Bank Group projects in China. A separate opinion wl also be giv     the audit of the
project accounts, Special Account and SOEs.
D. BKWG Am COLILCnON
4.12         CWSC bills about 376,000 accounts using a mual system. Until recently,
viualy all accunts were collected. In the past two yeas, there has been an inrease in
amouns owed by public enterprises but CWSC expects a recent goverament directive to result
in payments by these organzations. Even, including these increased receivables, they were still
less tan one month's sales at the end of 1991, which is very low compared with other couries.
4.13         The Construction Bureau currently bill wastewater charges based on water
consumption. All domestic customers and some nondomestic austoms are exempt from
charges. Charges are levied only on those who are connected to the system. As a result, about
1 1,000 customers are subJect to wastewater charges. CM3 collects only about 75 percent of the
charges that it levies.
4.14         By December 31, 1994, CWSC wUl develop a new coapred bilg system
at wil be usedfor both water and sewerage charges. ProJect funds will be used to deveop
the system, purchase equipment and train staff. CSC winl pay CWSC a fee for the sewerage
charge billing. Assances were obained atChgdca Mkcpallty wl authze the bilng
a/sewerage dcarges to all water users and cause dds extension to be carred out. T    action
together with cmbining the water and sewerage bills shod result in increase sewerage charge
collections.
E. PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT
4.15         In 1992, CWSC employed about2,400 permanent and 700 temporary staff. hi
translates into a staffing ratio of about 8 employees per 1,000 connections, which is very
reasonable compared to other developing countries. Whie CWSC has a welldeveloped staff
complement, the sewerage operations are understaW  in all discplines from enginrig to
operations. The total staff complement for the district sewerage crews is 168 wher   Facity
Management employs 165 for a tot of 333 employees. Changcdun Municipality has made a
preliminary proposal to increase staffing of CSC to about 1,600 people by January 1997, to take
account of the new facilities being put into service. A preliina  stffg proposal for CSC has
beeo submitted to IDA. This plan wDI be developed in furter detail by the TA (pam 4.9) and
fndalized by December 31, 1995.

4.16         CWSC and CSC will crea a number of posions with new resosbIities. To
ovecome the gap in exerience, Changchun MncWity is planning to ntit training
progam  Inuding: seminas and wodrhops; hands-on        d ans and training In the ue

4.17         CWSC has agreed tat, under the project, trann ficilities will be establhed
as part of to nw war teatment plant. lhese facities are Iended to serve s a model for
Norteast Chia and will include both fmal  hands-on traig in water supply system and

5.1          CWSC. Tables in Ame3   show the resiuts of CWSCs opations over the past
tee years and the projectons dthough 2001. CWSC returned a small profit in 1990, following
a           taiff Increase In September 1990. At tha time, ChangBu Municipt increased
indutrial and commeial ar   by 67 percen while doubling domesdc metered tariff.
However, CWSC Incurred a loss of Y 0.9 million in 1991, after hages for Inter  and

5.5          The Bala   Sheet for CWSC is shown in hAM . The major change in the
Bala   Sheet, other thn those resulting from the project, is the addition of Y 270 milion in
fixed assets between 1990 and 1m3 as the result of a Japanese funded program to Improve water
tuent capability. Changdun Municipality will provide the enire amount to CWSC as an

receivables, so CSC will not include any receivables in its initil Balance Sheet
C. CurmN  WATER SuPPLY AND SEWRGE TA mS
5.7          Water supply tariffs are based on metered consumption for 89 percent of
CWSC's accounts. The charge is Y 0.5 per cubic meter for commercial and industi cutomers
and Y 0.2 per cubic meter for households. Unmeered households are charged Y 0.07 per
person per month. Changchun Municipality last revised tariffs in September 1990, when Ihey
were incaed by 100 percent for domestc customers and 67 percent for nondometc
customers. CWSC also collects fees for connections and disconnections. The triff schedule
includes penalties for late payments, but these are seldom needed.
5.8          Since January 1992, Changchun Municipality has been chargig sewerge fes
of Y 0.21 per cubic meter based on 90 percent of water consumption, up from Y 0.1 per cubic
meter based on 90 percent of water usage. About 10 percent of the customers are exempt from
payment. Assurances were obtainedfrom Changhm Muncialty to end al commeil and

D. FINANCAL PERFOiNCE FORECASr
5.9          Both CWSC and CSC will have to increase tariffs as a result of the constuction
of new facilities under the project. Assurances were obtained tt sush tarW    wl hae to
generate sfdclent revenue to cover operation and mainenance cost, exclusive of iest, plus
deprecation or debt service, whidever is higher. Operating cost should iAdell paymes

(20 fen per 1,000 liters for domestic and 30 fen per 1,000 ltes for nndomestic co_smers,
with efet from January 1, 1993), to provide funding for its portion of the local share of the
project costs. This would be adequate until 1997, when it is estimated that it wil have to
increase tariffs by an average of 20 percent to cover increased operatng costs and depreciaon
fr the new facilities. An additional increase of 9 percent will be required in 1998.
5.11         Sewe.  CSC wil not provide any fundig for the project during the
onstruction period. After construction of the facilities has been completed, however, it will
cover all costs, including depreciation. In order to do this, CSC proposes irasing Iffs and
harIng all water customers as well as charging busies  with own water supplies, who are
connected to the sewage system. In order to do this, tariffs wi have to incre  by about
100 percent for domestic customers, based on 90 prcent of water usage. An esmated incom

PROJECT ANALYSIS
A. PRoJECr JUSTICATION
6.1          Changchun has developed a relatively integrated industrial base which includes
automobiles, machinery, chemicals, pharmaceutical products, paper, textiles, electronics, plating,
food, etc. Industry remains the main influence on economic growth in the city. However, water
shortages in the recent past have seriously impacted industry's ability to either mainain current
production levels on an annual basis, or to expand. In 1991, water rationing resulted in rates
of industrial productivity lower than would otherwise have occurred. With construction of major
runk sewers and introduction of primary treatment of sewage, the project also will reduce
pollution in the rivers flowing through Changchun. Through the project, the two institutions
responsible for water supply and sewerage, CWSC and CSC, will be strengthened in terms of
institutional structure, management, operations and mainnce, training programs and improved
financial viability.
B. IZAsr-COSr SOLUIMON
6.2          The selection of the water supply and transmission alternative, as well as the
appropriate sewerage system for the city, have been subjected to rigorous least-cost analysis.
A comprehensive study was made of alternative schemes for meeting the pattern of growing
water supply demand and determining the least-cost solution for treating Changchun's sewage.
6.3          An evaluation matrix of alternatives was constructed (five in water supply and
four in sewerage management) in order to account for the key factors that have an impact on the
alternatives. The evaluations were rated against a number of parameters. For the water supply
alternatives these included:  (a) sufficiency of supply; (b) low present value of cost;
(c) environmental considerations; (d) system reliability; (e) system flexibility; (f) reduction in
redundancy of existing works; and (g) minimization of jurisdictional conflicts. The parameters
evaluated in the sewerage alternatives included: (a) low present value; (b) enronentat
consideradons; (c) sewage reuse; (d) system reliability; and (e) system flexibility.
6.4          On the basis of the analyses conducted and the evaluations outlined above, and
fiurther confirmed by sensitivity tests, a least-cost Water Transmission Alternative and a least-cost
Sewerage Management Alternative were recommended for implemention.
C. ftoJrcr BENEFm
6.5          Ihe proposed project would provide urgently needed water to the Changchun
Metropolitan Area, eliminating the requirement for significant water rationing for residences and



-26 -
idustries. It would also introduce the first opeational primary swage teatme  fayciliy in
Changehun and, under the technical assistance progrm financed by tXe project, would assist in
the development of a strategy to deal with tie city's resultant haardos and nusi    waste.
The project would improve the eironmenta quality of the area, the stadard of livig of the
local poulton, and economic productivity of the major Industries. Furthermore, by reducing
leakages, rehabilitating pipelines, and contucting water and sewage trtm   facilties, it would
decrease the potential healdi risk posed by possible sewage infiltration into the water supply
systen-
D. EcoNolc RAT OF RzuRN
6.6          The economic i nternal rates of retrn (EIRR) of the two main project
components, water supply and sewage, were calculated separately. The combined BIRR for the
project Is emated at 13 petcen. For the water supply component, two main beneft were
quafied. The first included imputed benefits of increment water supply for resdnt  and
institutiona uses. This is derived using retail water rates, to be introduced in January 1993
(Y 0.41m' for domestic use and Y 0.8/m` for instittional and commercial use), as the proxy for
the benefits.. The second quantifiable benefit included value added estaes of industrial
productivity resulting from the intoduction of an increased water supply. This analyis was
based on the review, "Industrial Production Shortfalls Due to Limited Avability of Pped
Water (May 1992), prepared by the Changchun municipality government, which esmated an
indusi production loss of Y 0.5 mIion annually since 1985. For purposes of the eonomic
analysis, It was assumed that the "value added" benefit would approximate 25 percent of the
esimated industrial production losses per annum. It was furter assumes that the benefit would
remain constant during the life of the project. The resltant EIBR for the water supply
component is 11 percent.
6.7           Even wihi the inclusion of the *value added" benefit, the rate of retun
underestimates overall project impacts on the inhabitats of Changchun. The reason is tat, as
noted In pan. 6.5, the introduction of an adequate level of safe and reliable water supply wi
greatly improve living sundards, specifically in terms of health and general welfare. These
benefits, although un tfle, are expected to be significanL
6.8          A similar analysis was conducted for the sewerage compo L In this case,
incremental sewerage tariff revenue.was used as a prow  for benfts (Y 0.511/n for domesdc
and commercial use, and Y 0.5/in for industrW and instittional ue). Sewera  demand wa
based on the assumption that: (a) 20 percent of the water supply available for sale would be lost
rough leakage, etc.; (b) approximately 6 percent of the water supply would be used inteally
In the facflities; and (c) the ratio of treated water to water sold is 0.8. The resultant BERR was
calculated to be 23 percent.
6.9           Severa sensitivity analyses were conducted on each of the   _ . These
included: (a) a 10 percet cost increase; (b) a 10 percent cost increase accompanied by a
10 percet benefit decrease; (c) two-year project delay; and (d) exclusion of the ind  -value
added* benefit for the water supply component The resutant ElRRs are shown as follows:

6.10         The present tariff ace stll considered low for both residetia and industrial use,
being less than I percent of avage monthly family income for residences. bIcomes used for
these calculations represent only cash income and exclude subsidies in kind. The average
household income is at presen about Y 376 per month. Ihe average consumption of 410 lcd
for a four-peon household costs Y 2.46. Including sewerage, the average cost would be Y 5.0,
or 1.3 percent of total income, still much lower than the 5 percent considered affrdable for
water and sewerag services together.
F. ENVRONMENTAL TIWACr
6.11         An Enironme    Impact As           (EA) for the project was prepared by
consltants and reviewed by Bank staff and.by Changchun Municipality.  Cangch
Muniipalt and NEPA approved the repon, while the Bank considered the EIA to be accepable
with only mnor improveme nteomended on anMgements for Involunty restement
resuting from the project (pm. 3.29). A final ETA incorporating the IDDA's rmmeda
has ben prepared. A summary of the E1A report is provided in Annex 1.
6.12         The environm l impact of the proposed project was evaluated with respect to
eclogy, agiclue, and aesthetics. The restant impacts have been idetffied as thoe
occurg primaly during the consuion and post-constuction phases of the project, and are
as hullows:
(a)   the ecological impacts identified concemed the flora and fauna along the pipelin
route, pecifically the Yitong River and transfaation between the Second
Songhu River and the Shikoumen Reservoir. Vegetation along the pipeline
route, which is damaged by construction equipment, will be restored by
replantng grs and trees in the diurbed areas. On hillside slopes low bem
wM be consdtcted at reglar intervals across the right-of-way to prevent
excessive erosion. There would be minimal impact on anima life In the area;
(b)   the potenl for introducing algae from the Second Songhua River int the
ShI     en Reservoir Is considered to be minimal. However, there is
miniml potenti  for the Intoduction of parsites, such as protoeans,
flatworms and roundworms to the ShitoukomReservoir fishery, becase the
Yin Ma Rier and the Second Songhua River are connected at the covfluence of
these rvs some 40 miles down from the Shitoukoumen Reservoir. Also, fish



-28-
stocks in the Reservoir ae not native and are, in fact, introduced fom stocking
ponds located below the dam Therefore, the possible Impact of parasitic
introduction is expected to be minor;
(c)   the withdrawal of water from the Second Songhua River at Maja wil reduce t
amount of water available in the River for dilution and assimilation of raw
sewage *om the City of Jilin 16 km downstream of the Majaintake. is
anticipated deterioration in local water quity in the Second Songhua River to
the confluence with the Yitong River would be addressed thrugh the
introduction of improved sewage treatment within the City of Jilin within the
near future. Jilin Municipality has the responsibilty to effectively manage its
sewage disposal so as not to discharge raw sewage into the river and to exceed
the assimilative capacity of the Second Songhua River;
(d)   only minor agricultural impacts along the water  smission pipeline route and
construction site location of the treatment and pumping plant, are expected to
affect 300 area farmers, who will be compensated (para. 3.29). Ihe posiive
impact on Changchun because of increased availabilit of water supply and
sewage treatment should far outweigh the negative impact on agricultmal
productio..; and
(e)   the aesthetic impact is expected to be minor because construction will take place
mosdy in the rural countryside and will be localized and tempormy.
6.13         lhe project involves tributaries to the Songhua River, which eventually flows
into an international waterway. The Bank staff has made an asessmen that the ProJect would
not cause any appreciable harm to other riparians.
6.14         Similarly, a draft TOR for a Haardous Wastes Management and Industrial Park
Study also has been prepared (Anne I1).  Assurances were obtaied  aOtchangdun
Municpalty wUl engage consuitams and conplete the study by December 31, 1995 and Udll
bthen  eplanfor industrild relocaton. This was iitiated to assist Changdn Municipaity
to better prepare itself to address environmental issues associated with adisng and andcipat
new industies and their waste, many of which may be toxic and/or hazrdous matias. The
study would include analyses respecting the feasibility of designaing a partlr pordon of the
park as an industrial economic zone. Worker housng would be excluded from this area with
a plan developed for relocation of the worker population into a separate housing development,
free from industral pollution, but accessible to the  dustrial par
G. PtojEcr RIMS
6.15         Project risks, not including general risks due to policy and economic reforms,
are mostly in the execution of the water pollution control worhm and regulatory reform and
enforcement. Over the last two yeas, the local authorities have developed a much better
understanding of the consequences of the present domestic and indusria pollution in Changchun.
Ihe strong competition for investment funds for directly productive puoes and the reform of
industries using outdated production tehnology may affect the priority to be given by the
Government to finding follow-p pollution control enforcement and investment. Water resource
shortages affect the living conditions of almost everyone in the urban and mru  areas of



-29-
Changdhun and therefore also the economy of Jii Province. As a resUt there   a strong
commkment by the ProvincW and the Muniipal govrments to support propriat measures
to iprove the siuation.
6.16         Reforms In priciag are required to ensure that the desired benefits are generated.
As these changes affect a wide range and number of provincial and municipal government
agencies, difficulty in implementaon may be expected. Finally, there is a risk that delays may
occur in Implementation of the physical works of the project because Changchun Municipality,
CWSC and CSC have never taken up an investment program of this scale in the past; thus the
agreed emphasis on a strong PMO, backed up by eperienced consultants.

EXISTING WATER SUPLY AN SEWERAGE SYSTEM
Water Supply
1.           The water supply and distribution system of Changchun is managed by the
Changchun Water Supply Company (CWSC), and owned by Changchun Municipality. Two
conventonal water treatment plants (WTP) supply water to the system (see IBRD Maps 24063
and 24064). WTP 1 was built in 1934 under Japanese direction. Its raw water source is the
Yitong River, downstream of Xinlicheng Reservoir and upstream of the city. Approximately
52 million m31year is supplied to WTP 1. WTP 1 has very basic systems of chemical dosing
and control and a poor level of automation. It has a generally sprawling layout and is highly
inefficient. It Is unlikely that WTP 1. could be upgraded to the level of a modern treatment
plant. WTP 2, with a production capacity of 250,000 m3/day, was built in the early 1980s with
Japanese grant aid. Raw water for WTP 2 is abstracted from Shitoukoumen Reservoir on the
Chalu River, approximately 40 km east of Changchun. The quality of treatment from this plant
is generally good. Anmual withdrawal from the reservoir ranges between 40 and 80 million m3.
2.           The distribution system in Changchun Is a tree-like branched system instead of
a preferred closed-loop system. The system consists of two major types of main.:
(a)   Feeder mains (220 kn) of 300 mm to 1,000 mm diameter, which form the
sketon of the distribution system. They are located along the major streets and
carry water from the treatment plants to the smaller distribution mains; and,
3.           Smaller distron mains less than 300 mm diameter branch from the feeder
mains and supply water to the service connections of the residences and other buildings, and the
fire hydrants. In the past, the usual pipe material was cast iron, with a small portion of
galvanized iron pipe. Recently, plastic pipes have been used in the construction of new systems
or for the replacement of old mains.
4.           Site inspections and pipe friction measurements have shown that much of the
older cast iron mains are in very poor condition. The main reason has been identified as
corrosion caused by the distribution of aggressive water and the inadequate corrosion protection
of cast iron feeder mains and distribution mains. This is a general problem in China.
S.           In 1990, 365,000 domestic connections, serving 90 percent of the urban
population direcdy, were recorded, of which 60 percent were metered. Apartment buildings
have one meter and individual households in the building are not metered. There were about
6,000 commercial connections, of which 40 percent were metered and 2,500 industrial
connections, of which 73 percent were metered.



-33 -                            ANNEX 1
6.           Distribution ,zcring  began in the ealy 1980s.  Ihe present locally
manufactured volumetric water meters are do no guarantee reliable long 4enr recording and the
number of cases of defective meters requiring replacement is increasing. The reasons for the
poor performance are the poor quaity of the meters, which have a life expectancy of about 5
years, and the high pardtle and chemical precipitation because of ditribution system corrosion.
Improvements In the domestic metering is necessary but can only be made gradually with the
improvement of the water treatment and new constuction and maintenance of the distribution
system.
7.           Because of the above circumstances, It is impossible to determine exactly the
unaccounted-for water and the system water losses in Changchun. Leak detection activity is low
due to the lack of advanced detection equipment. Comparison with other cities having similar
systems and conditions suggests that many leaks remain undetected in Changchun and
consequendy substantial volumes of treated water are lost. A disincentive to complete metering
is that China's central govermnent has set guidelines that water losses should not be above
10 percent and in grading the performance nationally of the Water Supply Companies the water
loss data figure prominently.
8.           Most valves in the system are operated mamnly. There are no detailed records
of valve operations, repairs or maintenace; however, the same observations can be made as for
the distribution metering. Site investigation has revealed that there are insufficient valves in the
system to control and regulate flow.
9.           A total of nine manually operated pumping stations provide water to the
distribution system. The dischare pressure is maintained in the 5 to 6 kglcm1 range. There
are no pressure relief valves installed in any of the pumping stations to protect the systems from
water hammer, which may be caused by valve closures.
10.          All reservoirs are underground concrete structures. The total capacity is about
66,000 in3, which is about 12 percent of the maximum daily water consumption measured in
1989.
Existing Municipal Wastewater Handling System
11.          General. The Wastewater Master Plan for Changchun points out significant
problems with the existing sewage collection system, including: (a) poor materials and
construction; (b) inadequate maintenance of the system (attributed in part to maintenance
budgets); (c) poor construction quality and inadequate coordination of design and construction;
(d) sewers under buildings, resulting in maintenance problems; and (e) cross-connections of
storm sewers to sanitary sewers.
12.          ifiltration, coupled with partiy or completely silted up sewers, conlribute to
backing up of the system and flooding. Ihere are also major surface water drainage problems
created by uncontrolled constrauction within the natura drainage courses in the city. The limited
flow     emes made in November 1990 suggest that flow velocities in some sewers may
be insuffient to provide scouring under normal flow conditions.



-34. -
13.          Sewage Collecdon system. mm city s divided into nine dria  distrcts
developed according to the topogrphy and natural dinage cnels. The sewer system
Icludes both combined and separate sewers. Separate sewers carry both sanry and industW
wastewa, ad run parallel to stowrm sw     where hose eist. In he older diticts, combined
sewer systems, cveying saitary, industia and  m  flows, are more common.
14.          During the development of the sewer system over time, the combined or separate
sewers in the various drainage areas were constructed to dicharge via te shortest rute into hie
vaious natul streams, rvers, ponds or drainage courses witi he ciy area. Because the
sewage collection system has many separate raw wstewar dischargo points trougou the city,
there are severe eviromental problems in these water bodies.
15.          Sewers were first installed extensively in the older areas of the city such as the
Erdaohezi district on the east side during the 1930s. The existng sewer system consists of abou
324 km of combined sewers, 243 km of storm sewers and 212 km of sntay sewers. All newer
constuction has used separate sewers.
16.          la 1988, ainterceptor sewer was constucted in the bed of the main water
Course, the Yhong River, from Yong  Bridge to Dongda Bridge (3.2 km of 1,800 and
2,200 mm diameter concrete pipe). Access manholes protrude above the river level. At present
the interceptor ends at a temporary lift station just downstream of a rubber dam at the Dongda
Bridge. After constuction of the interceptor, the dam was constucted to create an impoundment
in the river for recreational use. Ihe intent is to eend the itecptor firiher north to the
proposed North Suburbs Sewage Treatment Plant The first part of this extension is now under
constction. The intceptor now discharges into the river thmugh an opening upstream of the
temporary lift station, which is to be removed upon completion of the intceptor system. Ihe
temporry lift station is activated when the river water level is too hgh to pemit gravy flow
in the interceptor.
17.          According to the Wastewater Master Plan, approximately 40 to 50 percen of the
city is serviced by sewers. About 60 to 70 percent of these are in poor condition due to lack
of repair. Many sewers are partiaUy blocked by silt and other residue. Ihe remaining
unsewered parts of the city are served by private or communal dry latrns. In 1987, there were
stll 2,875 dry latries in the city according to the Urban Consrci  Bureau.  hese latrines
are gradually being demolished as new housing, with sanitary sewer connecdons, replaces old
row housing.
18.          Stormwater in most parts of Changchun is usually combined with sanitary sewers
except in the Southwest, Auto Plant and Rail West districts where stormwater is collected
seaely. There are also open channels within the city to covey strmwater dranage into
creeks and rivers during the rainy season. Storm sewers and combined sewers do not finction
properly in the city and flooding commonly occurs durng rainy periods.
Constuction Meriasb
19.          Sewer Pipe.  Older systems are largely plain concrete structures without
reioforcing steel. After 1950, reinforced concrete was used for pipe sizes of 300-2,200 mm
dimer and unrenfbrced concrete pipes for sewers smaller than 300 mm diameter. Small
diamete vitrified clay tile pipe wih bel and spigotpjots is used for service connections. Joints



-3S -                            ANNElI
are filled with a cement/sn mortar. Poe    aro castr  pipo with bl and spigot join.
Joint can be eiher rubber or jute gasket with cement mortar packing.
20.          All joinls are tested accodn to the Chinese National Sandard, which requires
a joint to withstd a 4.0 m static head without leaking. Th intration for concrete sewers is
estmated to be 40 m/km/day at a pressue of less ta 4 m of groundwater (Wastwater Maste
Plan). A higher stadard may be needed in certain locations such as the inteceptor installed in
the Yitog River bed.
21.          Manholes. The shallow manholes on small diameter sewers are of ccular,
brick constructon, tpering towards the top. The manholes in the older areas east of the Yitong
River show sigps of penetraton by tre roots. On the larger diameter sewers observed, east of
the Yhtong River, the manholes are of vatZ  type, brick constuction to a depth of 1.S tD
1.8 m. The base is a square ooncrete slab on which the manhole barrel is constuced.
Conetons for sewers or storm pipes are constucted integrally with the base slab. These
connections appeared to be pofirly constucted instaled on an 'random' or 'as needed' basis,
poorly instled and subject to infltratton. In some of the newer areas precast concrete manholes
are being used. On the interceptor sewer the manholes are made of 4 m diameter precast
concrete iins.
22.          Sewer ntalaon Practics. Under the Chinese National Stadad, pipe
grdients are based on a miniwmm velocity of 0.7 m/sec. For pipes less than 250 mm diameter,
gasdes are generaly between 0.004 and 0.005 m/sec (0.4 to 0.5 percent). The maximum sewer
depth in normally 4 to 5 m.
23.          Wastewater and Stormwater ift Stations. Lift stations are used to transfer
watewater from points where sewers are too far below ground, usualy 5 m. They also prevent
bawkp from sewers durng flooding periods. Equipment instaled at lift stations includes coarse
screens and pumps but no metering devices. Spare pumps are provided, but there are no
altene drives for use in the event of power failure.
24.          Existing sewers in the Erdaohezi district are too low to permit gravity flow into
the main interceptor at the Yitong River. The water surface in the impounment upstream of
the rubber dam is higher than the wastewater level in the sewer. The Fufeng Lift Station in the
area does not handle the stormwater effectively during rainy seasons and flooding of that area
is reported to be common.
25.          Wastewater Treatment and Disposal.  Ihere is currenty no municipal
wastewater treatment plant. In the late 1960s, a primar treatment plant (East Suburbs WWTIP)
was built in the northeast part of the city with the intention of using treated effluent for
irrigation. In 1980,  aions (by the Changchun Agriculture Department) were stopped and
the fact  is in tota direpair.
26.          Both domestic and process wastewaters from Auto Plant No. 1 and the
Changchun Tractor Plant are being treated. The watwater treatment plant at Auto Plant No. 1
was built in 1987 and put into operation in 1989. The plant has a capacity of 25,000 m/day and
treat both domestic and process wtewaters in separate process trains. The secondary effluent
qualit is reported at 50 mg/L BODs. The total plant flow including process watewater is
reportedto be about 10,000 m3/day, or about 40 percent of plant descapacity. Faces have

28.           General. Industi wawater discharged to munici    sewage systems and
surface wa     is a major concern t the reuatory agencies In Changchun.  The toxic
cOnStitun  found in these waters have an adverse effect on the receiving water environment,
partiularly the Xi  and Yitong Rivers, and pose a potenal health thrat to residens of the
city and to downstream users.
29.          Major Idustries.  There were more than 1,600 individual factories in
Changchun in 1990.  The major industries in Changehun are atmobile, machinery
locomotives, trucks) and reiated equipment manufacture.  These three Industia  sectors

based on the preominance of one industry type. Based on wa_war data from industry (1989
and 1990) collected from Changehun Environmental Ptection Bureau (EPB) fRes, the total
Idustrial daily wastewater discge was es ted to be appro       y 120,000 m&Iday, about
53 pecent of the total wast_wat  loading from the city.
31.           Several fautories in Cbangchun currently appear to have adequate facies to
treat wastater. A smmary of the types of wavwater treatment used wihin the industries
present in Changchun is shown in Table 2. There are some Installations that appeared to reqi
further impwovement, more frequent monitoring, and improvement to the controls system. in
general existing industi waste treatment fcidites at several fctories were found to either be
nonprational or poorly operated. The many small facores, classified as  millano,
produce a large quantity of wastewater that is preseny discharged to the envionment without
any pretreaten.

32.           According to  e Changch  EPB, the pdrma  contaminan  of concern in these
industa waters are a    ianitrogen, COD, formaldehyde and phenols. Ihe EPB considers
that the heavy metals, oil and grea, and cyanide are bing contolled adequaWy and



-38 -                           ANA1
concenratins are within the National guidelines. Based on the 1989 water quality data obtained
from the EPB fDr the Yitog River, this is not the case.
33.          As wae treant proces  Increase In umber and improve in efficiency in
thoe &te, mor wast sludges wiU be produced. Currently, there is no coordinst  program
in pla  to hanfdle, dispose or reus and redlaim  _    sludges, although som  effort is
being made (see para. 36).
34.          Praazt Dschage Lmits.  Industal waswwaters from  Changchun are
dischged into receiving waters, by means of surace dranage canals or through pipes to rivers.
Auto Plant No. 1, for example, discges its wastewater to the Xinkal River following
treamen   New, or expanded facilities are governed by a more stringent set of wastewater
diage stndards which reflect National govement (State) requirements for improved
industal waste teatment technology.
35.          Status of Edsting Facilites. In spite of the setting of these discharg limits,
the majority of industries in Changchun do not have wasw er tret    facilities alftough
wastewater at major fcilities are trated to some degee. In some fatories, teatment cilities
ae present, but are not operating.
Industial Waste Sludge Disposal
36.          IndustrIal Waste. Sludge disposal in Changchun is only practiced on a small
sae at prese.L 'he majority of industries in the city do not treat their w _awr sfficienly
to create sludges. Sludge recovery is restricted to operatis dealing with heavy metals, power
plant scrbber water, some oils, and some of the food industries. The sludges being produced
are parally used as a fuel source, along with coal, In boiler fines or in brkick kins. Other
sludges are removed for use by farmers as fertilizer or are dewatered, and dried to form filter
cakes which are eifter reused directly or reprocessed to remove valuable materis, such as
comium and other heavy metals. Agricu    reuse of sludges is decreasig because of the
suspicion that these materials may be contamiated wit heav metals and phenols, which may
become incorporated into the food crops. The quantity of industial sludges genated in
Changhu is esdimated at about 9 tomes per day (3,285 tomnes per year). Ihis figure was
derived by asuming that only 13 percent of the total produced industia wastewater is crety
teated, and 0.05 percent of this actually becomes sludge. Sludge disposa technology in
Changcn is in its infancy, primarily because of a lack of sfficient waste treatment technoogy
and faciities, and not because of a lack of willingness to address the problem. Ihere is a
wiingness to reycle as much as possible provided the economics are appropriate. As the
mixed patter of housing and industries is the major imedme  to industia waste collection
and treatment, during project preparation an industia zone was creaed and a study is included
in the project to examine in detail the problem of industi waste treatment (para. 6.10).

protectio of the envwinment from inuia sources. Ihere are three levels of the EPB that
ar responsible fo renvironmeItal protectio  and discharge limits-State, Provincial and
Municipal orgntions. The Municipal, or Changeun EPB is responsible for monitoring
Idsr  dishar   within the city. It has three opaional units to deal with disdcarges and

emissioks to water nd air, nd nois leves. Teo EPB requires indur  to monito discage

compliance by sampling once or twice per ye. If a particular indusr has a raed of
violation of the discharge sanr, the EPB wfll increase its level of survaillane monitoing.
At all large factorles an EPB office is maitained on site. The mandate of ths site offlce is to
supervise all matters related to the environment and pollution control.
38.          It is reported in the Changchun Wastewater Master Plan (1990) that the
impI    on of end         _ental rgets set by the EPB in the most recent Five-Year plan
(1985-90) has resulted in a sgnificaut reduction in disage volumes from industries as
meared by priority pollutant streogth. However, these reductions have not resulted in a
significant improvement in receiving water quaity based on 1989 field data.
39.          As part of the Five-Year Plan currnty in effect, each industry was allocated a
target for water reuse (up to 20 percent in the case of Auto Plant No. 1). During the
development of water demand projections, it was seen that these targets have nt been met, or
even approaced. In fiact, at some factories reuse is restricted to the recycling of cooling waters
only. Curryty a program is being conducted by the Water Consvation Office of Chagchn
to promote the isllation of cooling towers in factories and to substitute air coolers for cooling
water systems as measures to reduce industral water consumption in the future.
40.          All new industries and expansions to existing industrW  facilities require
participation of the Changchun EPB in the design, construction and operation of in plat
pollution abatmnt tenologies including wastewater treatment and sludge disposal. Thi
policy, known as the 'hree Same Tune Policy,' was Introduced in the ealy 1980s to eNsu
at industries were complying with current environmental guidelines and discharge limits. The
number Ibree' refers to the three levels of participation i.e., design, construction and
opeation. The advantages of this policy are obvious if carried out, since it means that the EPB
is involved in all facets of the pollution control programs built into all new or expanded
facilities. However, expansions and new facilities are often governed by economic demand, to
the exclusion of environmental protection. Given the low level of waste treatmea in Changchun
at present it does not appear that the policy has been fully implemented.
41.          Pealmty System. To facilitate the implementation ofpollution control objectives,
a penalty system has been devised by the Changchun EPB to Aiscourage the disposal of
contaminat to the sewage system. The money collected from penalties is alocated to a fnd
designed to subsidize the construction of pollution abatement facilities. Usualy a grace period
is allowed to those industries charged for noncompliance to allow them to either correct the
situation, or to constuct or modify their waste treatment facilities. The extent of the grace
period depends on the exte of required modifications.
42.          Loan and Tax  1cnves. Currendy, the Changehun EPB has avaiable a fund
for the Implementation of pollution abatement programs by industry. This fund is derived from
fines collected as a resut of Industry exceeding waste discharge limits. Eighty pernt of the
total of collected fines are rearned to this fund. Individual factories can apply for a losa from
this. fund if predetermined conditions are met. The loans, repayable over three years, are
prioritized on the basis that factories have: (a) a deadline for the implementtion of pollution
controls; (b) operao  that impact the environment of the nearby neighborhood; and (c)
obaned up to 60 percn of the required funig from other sources.

WATER DEMAND AND SEWERAGE FORECASTS j
A. WATER DEMAND
1.           Where water h abundant, the tem  wter dmand and water consmpdon have
often been used interchgeably since spply is able to meet demand. However, a dstinton
must be made between the tems in instaces, such as Changchun, whee water is limited and
the avaiable supply is unable to meet the demand.
Projeted Consumption
2.           Water supply will constrai consumption dtrough the period of the present
project and beyond. Consequently the trend of water consumption will be decided primarily by
the avale treatmen car et of the eist  and new water transmission and treatment
fcilities. The difference ' tween demand and the available supply will determine the rate at
which consumption reaches maxdmum available supply capacity. When supply and demand are
of comparable magnitude consumption wJll be slow to reac maximum supply capacity, but when
demand is much greter than supply, maxmum supply capaiy will be consumed rapidly.
Consumption may then be predicted with a fair degree of accuracy based on the water available
under the project.
Demand
3.           Esimation and projection of demand in areas experiencing water shortage are
complex ts. The major difficulty arises from the lack of historical data on which estimt
may be based. In water-rich areas this problem is not so acute since present consumption gives
a solid indication of demand and many North American municipalties model future demand on
a direct mathematical projection of historical con Ion. Tbis approach is invid where
consumption is strongly restricted.
4.           As an altenative, demand can be compared to other mnicipalities, at their
present or previous states of development. A paralel projection may then be prepared. Of
course, the concept of parallel projection wil be tenuous at best sinLce no two areas will be
subject to the same economic or physical influences and will not likely respond in a similar
manner.
11  The following analysis of water and wastwater demands are a summary of forecasts made
by UMA Engineerng, Ltd., of Calgary, Canada.



-41-                             ANNEX2
5.           Under these circumstances, demand estmates and projection must rely strongly
on the judgment of the team making them, on the prevous experience available and on what
appears reasonable. The experience of local officials must also be strongly relied upon. This
essentily describes the siaon in Changehun which has been water starved for most of its
recent history. Estimates and projections were therefore made on the basis of previous outside
experience with consideration to the advice available from local technical staff.
6.           Projected demand holds more relevance the closer it is to the base year, since
the formulating assumptions will be modified less. As projection moves farther into the future
the defining conditions may change due to unpredictable influences and the accuracy of the
forecast is less assured. For example, the prospect of supply limitations may force the adoption
of more water efficient industrial practices. Also, as demand approaches saturation level the
growth rate will diminish. At this stage, however, the influence of these factors cannot be
predicted. For this reason constant growth rates have been used for the demand components.
7.           In keeping with the classification system under which the Changchun Water
Company maintains its records, demand was estimated for residential, institutional, commercial
and industrial categories. The individual estimates were te totaled to give overall present
demand.
8.           Since 1989 was the last year for which complete data were available, in terms
of production and consumption categorization, this was used as the base year for projection.
Distribution System Losses
9.           Accurate analysis of water leakage in older distribution systems is often difficult.
Infuences such as nonsealing valves, unmetered connections, and uncertinty as to the total
number of connections may reduce the accuracy of loss surveys. Historically these factors have
frustrated efforts to quantify losses from the Changchun distribution system. In an effort to
estimate losses international consultants compared production and consumption volumes reported
by the Changchun Water Company.
10.          The results of the comparison are provided in Table 1, which shows
unaccounted-for water data ranging from 3 percent to 12 percent. When the age and general
state of repair of the distribution system components are taken into account, it is felt that this
range of losses are unreasonably low. In the United States, where resources for distribution
system maintenance and construction are more readiy availle, system losses for cities with in
excess of one million population average about 17 percent.2/ Even allowing for the relatively
low system pressure and the impervious soil found in Changchun, it is esdmated that losses in
the Changchun system are in the order of 20 percent.

Since the biggest unmetered volume falLs in the rednal category most of the loss will be
included in this estimate.

19.          These per capita demand estim     were multiplied by popuation percentages
within each category, as supplied for 1989 (Table 4). For demand est_imon, complete
popuaton service was assumed.
20.          Residential watr consumption has icreased rapidly as more water became
avaiable over the past six years. The expected poput   increase (1.5 percent per annum)
combined with improved accommodaton and a more widerad availability of water-using
appliances wil increas the residen    demand during this perid. The standard of livig afd
on improvement are estimated to cause demand to inre    at ately
4 percent per anim. The reidentia demand projectiom in Table 1 assume a 4 percen per
capita increase combined with a 1.5 percent population increase.

22.          It is considered likely  a exstng  ident  use of Institutional water will be
curtailed in response to the higher tauf  applied to insonal conumption. in recogition of
these faors the rate of institbuonal demand icrease was estiated at 2 perce    nstitona

23.          Industrial consumption increased by approximely 50 percent to 141,000 mnYd,
between 1981 and 1990. lbis was due to increased industrial producton and expansion over
this period. Significant  ompdon Icreases fbllowed the expansion Of pla  capacity at
WTP 2 althoug, as would be epected, the time taken by industry to respond to greater water
availabiity was longer hn that shown for residential increase.
24.          Of all the categories analyzed the data available for this category is the mast
rliable. Apoxim y 96 percen of industW consumption is metered and additional demand
is based on requests, recorded by the Changchun Water Company, for more water. In 1989 the
total average day industri consumpdon was 137,000 m3Id. Additonal idendfied industria
demand is sbown in Table 6.

25.          Changckun has become one of the major mufig centers of China,
parculay for the ao bile, truck and rail industies. Other lighter industies have become
firmly established and are likly to expand operation as more water becomes available. Even
though watr availability will always limit industril expansion within the city the established
industi  base is too strong tD make drastc reduction in demand possible, ather than by
inceased use efficiency. The ccrasultants esimated that industrial water demand wil increase
at approximaely 4 percent per ann    Inheret in this estimate is the assumption of more
efficient water use and rause as industry modenie.

CommercdaUConstruction
26.          Both commercial and construction consumptions are small relative to the other
components and have remained reasonably constant over the record period. Both are considered
unlikely to change within the near fiture.
27.          Commercial consumption has remained constant over the last ten years and is
not considered likely to increase appreciably in the future. Since the volume of water consumed
within this category is small the demand and consumption will not have a noticeable impact on
supply. Therefore, demand and consumption ae considered the sanwe. A 1 percent annual
increase was considered the aimum  which would occur.
28.          The above is summarized in Table 7, Water Demand Projection and in Figure 2,
Supply and Projected Conumption to 1999.
Implications of Projected Demand (1991-2000)
29.          The most immediate implication of water demand as calculated for Changchun
is that it will not be satisfied by the implementation of the present water transmission project.
30.          Because the city has been undersupplied for so much of its recent history, water
demand now greatly exceeds supply, with the result that expansion of supply to meet this
demand completely, within the near future, would be extremely costly.
31.         It is critical that the present supply scheme be completed as soon as possible
since it will reduce the discrepancy between supply and demand and will be the initial step
towards releasing the present bounds placed on industry.
lmplications of Projected Demand (2000-2020)
32.          If demand continues to grow at the present rate it wil be almost impossible to
meet it. The present demand structure must therefore be changed. This requires that existing
and future industries be made -ore water efficient. By adopting more water conservative
technology, industries wiUl be able to maintain or increase production while using less water,
i.e., reduce demand. In addition, more recycle and even reuse of water should be promoted.
B. WASTEWATER DEMNDS
33.          According to the Wastewater Master Plan, approximately 40 to 50 percent of the
city is serviced by sewers. The remaining parts of the city not sewered are served by communal
dry latrines.
34.          Although there is a steadily increasing number of households having shower and
hot water facilities, there is a decline in the percentage of households with sewer connections.
This may indicate that the sewerage utility is not able to cope with the demand for new
connections as the population increases.

would undertake reviews of current opations and mak reco  ons relative to annual
budget preparations, new projects, utility rates and other matters requiring a senior management
decision.
4.           The following principles should be adopted by CWSC and approved by
Changchun Municipality for implementaion:
(a)    CWSC should operate on a full cost recovery basis with revenues generated
through water rates.
(b)   Costs should be paid by users in proportion to the service they receive and their
ability to pay.
(c)    User fees should address both operational costs and debt retirement of capital
expenditures.
(d)   Water metering should be universal and the company should work towards the
implementation of this strategy. Water metering is essenial to fair cost sharing
and to water conservation.
(e)    CWSC should have the authority to make the operational day-to-day decisions
wihin the approved budget and staff levels during the fiscal year.
(t)    Operator and employee trainig and development should be given high priority
and the Company should encourage and facilitate exchanges at the intrnational
level.

ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
CHANGCHUN WATER SUPPLY COMPANY (CWSC)
Tariffs             Tariffs increase by the following percentages. Increases are effective in
December of the prior year to slow for a full year's biling at the higher
levels.
1993    68%
1997    17%
1998     6%
1999     1%
2000     3%
2001     3%
Tariffs cover aU operading costs including depreciation and interest.
InfLation           Infation is 6 percent In 1992 and 5 percent thereafter.
Operating Costs     An cost except interest and depreciation increase at the rate of infaion.
in addition, 1993 power and chemical costs are adjusted by the
percentage increase in production.
Incremental COSts for 1997 are based on estate by CWSC and its
consultants adjusted for inflation.
Supply and transmission costs are inclwfed in CWSC accounts even
though these wil be contacted to the Water Resources Bureau. CWSC
will pay all of these costs.
Sales               An additional 27 mld of water is avaiable for sale in 1993 to be
distributed in the same proportion as esting sales.
An addional 380 mld is available for sale in 1997 as the result of this
project. It is distruted to residential and nonresidential users in the
same proportion as current sales.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Introduction
1.           Changchun is the capital of Jilin Province, located in the northeast of the
People's Republic of China. It is the center for political, economic and cultural activities of the
region. The city has experienced steady growth In the past and is anticipating contued growth
in the foteseeable future. However, throughout much of its recent history, Changchun's water
supply has been unable to keep pace with increasing industrial and domestic demand. 'Me water
shortage has now reached such proportions that it threatens to suppress further industrial and
domestic developn2nt within the city. Also, Changchun currently has no wastewater treatment
other than the 6,600 m3/d treatment facility at Auto Plant No. 1. Many areas of Changchun rely
on creeks and open channels, which pass through residential and industrial areas, to convey raw
wastewater to the Xinkai and VItong Rivers. This exposes the citizens of Changchun to
unacceptable health risks from disease-csing organisms and toxic chemicals. The ecosystems
downstream from Changchun also suffer from these conaminated wastewaters.
2.           The water supply and environmental project for Changchun is aimed at
improving the existing water supply and wastewater management systems. The existing water
supply capability will be expanded from the present 438,000 m3/d to 794,000 m3/d at the
completion of Stage 1 (1996) of the project while wastewater treatment systems capable of
providing primary treatment will be constructed for the city.
3.           For the water supply portion of the project, in addition to transferring
approximately 450,000 m3/d of water from the Second Songhua River to Changchun, a number
of other components necessary for the treatment and delivery of the treated water wil also be
included:
(a)    water transmission via the Chalu River and the Shitoukoumen Reservoir to the
city,
(b)    water treatment plant construction and upgrading,
(c)    water distribution system analysis and improvement, and
(d)    water utility reorganization to streamline the existing structure into a more
efficient and effective operating company.
4.           The proposed wastewater management project will construct a primary treant
plant (North Suburb Wastewater Treatment Plant), that will treat 368,000 meld wastewater from
the Yitong river drainage area collection system and remove about 50 percent of the pollution
charge.

5.           The wasewater management plan also nudes:
(a)    etnion of the exng watwater collection system, and
b)   foration of a wastewater utlity company.
6.           A Candian consulting firm, UMA Engneeing Ltd. (UMA), was retained by
Changchun Municipality to develop a strategic plan for augmenting water supply and addsing
environmentl protecton to the year 2020. The plan was developed in August 1991 as part of
the feasiility study in accordance with the World Bank's eiements.
7.           The World Bank's policy for investment lending requir that an eonmal
impact _asm     (EIA) be prepared for large-scale water supply and wastewater management
projects to ensure that the development options considered are environm y sound and
sustnable.  bis report presents the baseline as well as the predicted status of the project
activities during the pr uction, constuction and operation phases of the project. An
environmenta management plan fc: mitigating adverse Impacts and maimizing beneficial
impacts has also been outlined.
Policy, Legal, and AdmInistrative Framework
8.           This environmental impact assessment is prepared in accordance with the
equirements of the World Banks Operational Directive 4.01.  ne   national, provincial and
local enviromental laws and regulations were also referenced.
9.           Ihe Chinese National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) is the highest
authority on environmental policy but shares authority with the Ministry of Construction and the
Mnistry of Water Resources on the development/utiation of the Songhua River water
resources. Similarly, Jilin Provincial Eavironmental Ptecton  Bureau (JEPB) is the highest
level of authority on environ l policy in the province. JEPB shares authority with
Prvincial Bureau of Constuction and Bureau of Water Resources on the provincial water
resources. The Song-Liao River Basin Administration is also responsible for and coordinates
the water quantity and quality of the Songhua River.
10.          During the enviromental data collection and impact assessment stages, several
meetings were held. Representtives from different local, provcial as well as national agencies
participated in these meetngs along with UMA and the World Bank staff and consultans.
Analysis ot Alternadves
11.          Several alternatives concning the transport of water, the water treament
systems and the wastewater management schemes were examined in the feasibility study. Those
altenatives included a direct pipeline from Maja to Changchun, pipeline instead of unnel
element, different intake locations, etc. Based on the overall considerations, but primarily
economic, cost and enviromental fctors, one alterative was selected. lhe following section
describes the recommended alternative.

Ptojec Descriptn
Water Supply
12.          Ihe watr upply portion is the main objecdve of this project.  The
recommended water supply altetve provides for the trasmison of raw water from the
Second Songhua River tO Changhn via the Chalu River and the Sh u Reservoir. Ihe
water intak from the river as well the fist of three new pump stations will be located at Maja;
the other pump stations will be located at Tunshasi and Dasui. Tle route of the tserred
water wlll take it from Maja tO the Tanshansi pump staion, trough te 7.9 km Laoyeding
tune, to te Dasul sation and into the Chalu River. At the north end of the Sho n
Reservoir an equal volume of water will be withdrawn. The Sh men Resevoir intakel
pump sto will move the water to the Fanguguo booster pump station where the supply will
splk between th rutes to the exst   Water Treatmet Pln No. 1 (T  1) nd Water
Treatment Plant No. 2 (WTP 2). All of the raw water supply for WTP 1 and some of th
Wpply for WTP 2 will be provided from the Second Songhua River. The balance of the supply
to WTP 2 (220,000 mP/d) will come from the ShooeChalu basin  In addWon,
apprximaty 20 percent of the supply for the new Water Treatment Pla  No. 3 (WIP 3) wil
be from the Second Songhua River. The remaining 80 percent will come direcdy from the
Xinicheng Reservoir through twin pipelines.
13.          After frs stage construction (1991-9) the daily withdrawal rate from the Second
Songhua River will reach 450,000 m3Id. After the second stage of invetment and construction
(1996-99) the withdrawal rate wil increase to 950,000 m&Id. Since the city wil be in a constan
state of undersupply it is likely tat the withdrawal rate will continue to increase in the early
years of the next century. Further expansions of pumping and trent capacity may become
necessay.
14.          As additional water tetment capacity wil be required a new 220,000 m'/d
plant, referred to as Water Treatment Plant 3 (WTP 3) will be contructed. Also, rather thn
expanding the old and inefficient WTP 1, a replacement plant referred to as WTP 1 Replacement
Pln (WTP 1 R), wil be bult at a later stage. Upon completion of tds planthe original
WTP 1 will be decommissioned.
Mundelpal Wastewater Man      It Stratea
15.          The wasater management portion of this project is provided to improve the
current and anticipated wastewater conmin problems in Changchun.  The main
compoents for the proposed municipal w ater management stategy are:
(a)    Establish a new Wastewater Company to manage and oversee all areas of the
municipal wastewater system;
(b)   Initiate a citywide waswater monitoring program to accurately deterine the
volumes and ch    cs of wastewater flows in the various contribut areas
of the city;
(c)    Complete construction of the Yitong River intrceptor sewer to convey
w     _stewae to the site of the Nordh Wastewater  Iem     Plan    his will



- 84 -                          ANNE la
include 3 km at 1.0 m diame, 1.9 km at 2.8 m diameter and 4.8 km at 3.0 m
diameter concrete pipe;
(d)    Constuct a 368,000 m3/day primary wastewater treatment plant at the North
Suburb Wastwater Treatment Plant site. Plant facilites will include inlet
works, lift station, preatmen (screening and aerated grit removal), primary
clarification and sludge pumping and anaerobic sludge treatment followed by
sludge dewatering; and,
(a)   Implement a staged rehabilitation program fr the exisng wastewater collection
system. Ihe objective Is to upgade the lateral, trunk and interceptor sewers to
reduce inflow and infiltration.
Indutil Waste Management
16.          Currenfty Changchun has a diversity of industries but without an agteed
industr  waste management strategy. Each factory discharges or treats its own wastes with
minimal overall envionmental consideration. The main components for a future industrial waste
management project are as follows:
Institutonal Reform
(a)    Concurrent with the establishment of the recommended Municipal Wastewater
Company, implement a sewer use by-law and attdant regulfions for industri
waste discharges into the municipal sewer collection system.
(b)   Expand the responsibility of the present Song-Liao River Basin Adminision
to Include ambient water quality management of the Second Songhua River
basin. This  nsration would revise ambient water quality guidelines as
required and undertake regular monitoring of the rivers and streams within the
basin. A draft terms of reference (OR) for the improvement of the Song-Liao
River Basin Adminisation has been prepared.
(c)    Form a planning advisory group composed of State, Provincial and the Second
Songhua River Basin Adminitation to advise the Wastewater Company and the
Changchuw Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) in the formulation and
review of standards for effluent control.
(d)   Establish a Provincial Authority for Industrial Standards and Approvals. This
Authority would establish minimum discharge standards to be adopted within
JUin Province.
(e)    Establish a Compliance Monitoring Department within the proposed Wastewater
Company. This department would be responsible for approval and licensing of
all industrial wastewater dischages within the boundaries of Greater Changchun
(Six Counties). This Department would adso conduct compliance monitoring of
all industrial discharges to the municipal sewerage collection system.



-85-                            AN= XO
(t)    Changchun EPB would be responsible for compliance monitoring of industri
effluents which discharge dkety to a reeving wat  orse within te city.
Industrial discharges outside the city limits (Six Counties) would be Ihe
responsibility of the Provincial Auhiority.
Industrial Parks
17.          Currently there is no industrial park etablishment in Changchun.  It is
recommended that an industrial parks be established in the northeast and southwest secions of
the City to ensure proper management of the numerous industries. A first site was aleady
selected by the Changchun municipality. The project includes -Changchun ToxicdHardous
Waste Management and Industrial Park Studies" for which a draft TOR has been prepared
(Annex 11).
Toxic/Hazardous Wastes Tramportation and Treatment
18.          Changchun Municipality reported that currently the city generates about 5,000
tons per year of cyanide from the No.5 Chemical Plant, about 40,000 tons per year of boron
sludge from No. 1 Chemical Plant and approximately 5-10 tons per year of nitrobeee eher
and aminobemzene ether from Changahun Pharceutical Factory. Landfil and inceaton are
being used to dispose these toxic/hazardous wasts. it is anticipated that after the completion
of the Changchun Water Supply and Environmental Project, new industries and factories will
be established and additional toxic/hazardous wastes will be generated. During project
prepration, a centralized collection area was aready selected by the Changchun municipality.
19.          Ihere is a need to develop a toxic/hazardous waste  ortation andt m
straty   for the City. The above-mentioned TOR for the Toxic/Hado  Wastes Management
and Industia Park also describes the details of this strategy (para. 17).
WatS Conservation Policy
20.          Currently Changchun has no set water conservation policy although it is aware
about the need and potential benefit for such a policy. The ETA recommends a comprehensive
industrial water conservation program be established to reduce water consumption and waste
generation. Elements of this policy would include recycling of wastewater strams within
industries, reduction in water requirements per unit of production, employee trainin progms
in water conservation and waste reduction. The TA included in the project focuses on this
problem.
21.          To further encourage water conservation, the Water Company wiU graduay
improve with the help of TA, accurate water metering, and charge industil conm     on an
wincreasing block" rate basis. The price of supplied water should increase as the consumption
increases, rather than remain a fixed price per unit of water.
Envronmental Baseline Data
22.          Changchun Municipality is located in northeastern China at proximately43°55'
north latitude and 125°18' east longitude. The centra service area of Changchun has a
population of 1,762,000, as detmined by the most recent census taken in 1990. The



8-A                                       I
taphy of the Province comprises the Song-Liao plain in the certral part, the lower grassland
region in the west and the Canai mountaim which dominate the landscape in the eastern part.
23.          Chang ihns inthe cent of the Song-Liplain. The genera relief of te city
is unlatng with the lowest elevation being 194.0 m above sea level datum and the highest
elevation at 247.8 m. The lowlying area is aong both sides of the Ytog River. The highest
elevation is on the ridg sching fiom the universiq area in Zhaoyang district aong the
railway tD the southwestem part of the City.
24.          Changchun has a contnenta climate; the wir are long and cold and the
mmers are hot and humid. Low winter t etu    can be -40C and high summer
temeraturs have reached 39C. The average annsal precipiation Is approximately 600 mm.
25.          The Ytong River flows from south to north through Changchun. A second
river, the Xial, is a tributary of the Yitong and flows from south to north outside the west
suburb of the ciy. Flows in these rivers are nomaly low and receive the watewaters
dishaged from residendal, institutional, commercial and industrial development. These two
rivers discarge to the Yimma River which subseentlydcharges to the Second Songbua River.
26.          The main crops in Changchun area are corn, soyben, rice and grain. 1dustri
production in Changchun Includes automobile, machinery, chemicals, pha cal producs,
pape, textiles, elecunics, plating, food and others.
27.          Chang bun is siated in a wae-short region.  he small river bsin and
groundwater yields are unable to provide sufficient water for the city. Ihe present sources of
supply are the Ximlicheng Reservoir on the Yitong River upstream of Changchun (184,000 mI
day) and the Shoomen Reservoir which is fed by the Yinma and Chalu Rivers
approximately 40 km to the east of Changchun (220,000 m?/day). Grounwater wells within the
City contribute 34,000 m?/day. Currently the water supply works are admistred by the Water
Supply Company which repots to the City Utility Bureau.
28.          Wasewater treatm    and e          protection is viruly nodstent in
Changchun. The bulk of the wastewater is collected by sewers and discharged directdy to the
Yitong ad Xinai Rivers without treatment. An excepon is the No. 1 Auto Plamt which has
a treatment plant (25,000 mOld capacity), but its perfrmance is questionable. The prese
wamwat_ collection system i8 not sufficient to serve the demand for drainage. Average sewer
coverage is 40 to 50 percent of the city area, and 60 to 70 percent of the existing sewers are in
poor condition.
EnvIronment__ Impacts
Water Supply
29.          Eoviromental impacts for the proposed water supply project activities have been
evaluated with respect to five categories: ecology, agriculture, aestetics and human interest and
public health. These impacts occur primarily during the construction and post-construction
phases of the project.



-87-                            ANNE
30.          The ecological Impacts are concerned with flora and fauna along the pipelie
route, and transtlon betwee th Second Songhua River and the Shitouomen Resevoir.
Vegetaton on the pipdine route wDI be impactd by constuction on the construction right of
way. Very little impact wil ocr to animal iUfe.
31.          Both Fengmn and Sh       ereservoirs appear to have an ample supply of
major nutrients, phosphorus and nitogen for biologia growth. Sh komn conts more
phosphorusan Fengman. Based on field observations of the high suspended solids loading
which appars to be princpally colloidal days, it is probable that nuch of the phosphorus load
is inorganic and bound up in the sediments and not avaable for biological production. Based
on phosphorus avaitility, Peagman would be classified as being mesotopic ari1 Shit
as eutrophic. Suspended solids loading in Fengman appears to be low and oveall water clarity
far exceeds that of Shtouloumen during the open-water season. Ihese factors suggest that the
potential for Introduction of algae from Second Songha River water into Shitoukoumen
Reservoir would be minimal.
32.          There are nine families and 48 fish species in Fengman Reservoir, of which 42
are native apd the other 6 have been introduced. The Second Songhua River has 64 species.
No information was avaiable on their disbtion or relative abundace. The one exception is
Acanthobrama simoni, a member of the dace cup family. Ths species is exotic to the Fengman
Reservoir, intoduced by accident, and now is very abundmt in the reservoir.
33.          There are seven families and 46 fish species in the Yinma basin including
Shitoukoumen Reservoir. Acanthobrama simoni i not among them. Early life stages of this
fish species could survive the transmission fiom Maja and become established in the reservoir.
The potti  exists for transfer of one or more of the 18 additional fbh species into
Shitoukoumen Reservoir via the proposed transfer line. The potential for the introduction of
parasites such as protozoans, flatworms and roundworms to the ShitoukoumenReservoir fishery
was possible and probable. If this occurred, the potenal exists for losses in the Sh umen
fihery. However, fish stocks in the reservoir are not native and are in fact introduced from
socking ponds located below the dam. Iherefore, the impact of parasitc ioduction is
exected to be short term (five yeas) and relatively mior.
34.          Lpreys have been in the Fengman Reservoir, Second Songhua River and the
Yima River but were not found in the Shitoukoumen Reservoir even though it is part of the
Yinma River. The arctic lamprey is a fish parasite. Although'not considered as serious a
potential pest as the accidental introduction of the sea lamprey to the North American Great
Lakes, introduction of the arctic lamnrey to Shitoukoumen Reservoir will very likely impact the
commercial fiheries. Although not expected to have a devastating effect based on a lack of
records in other parts of the world cnceng significant impact on freshwater fisheries, the
exact level of impact canmot be predicted. However, if the arctic lamprey were a highly
sgnificant fish parasite with regard to impact on wmmercial fisheries, there would be a long and
detaied literature base concerning its impact on economically important fish species. Since this
is not the case, the potendialimpact i threfore considered to be low. Also, both rivers, the
Second Songhua River and the Ylnma River are connected at the confluence of these rivers some
40 mils downstrem  of the Sht         Reservoir, and the absence of lampreys in the
reservoir may be due to the commerciday intoduced fish.

35.          Ahe withdrawal of water from Maja will reduce the amount of water available
in the Second Songhua River for dilution and assimilation of raw wastewater from the City of
Jilin. Inially 450,000 m3/d (1996) and ultimately (2020) 1,137,000 m3/d will be withdrawn for
the city of Cbangchun from this source. The ultimate withdrawal is approxnimately 10 percent
of the recorded low flow (95 percent probability of occurrence). At the present time, the Second
Songhua River upstream of Jilin City is a Class 11, while downstream of ilin City a Class V
river based on the BOD5 load (see full EA for data). Class V is the worst classification in the
Chinese National Standard GB3838-88. It is estimated that approximately 25 percent of the
current river flow under average river flow conditions ia comprised of wastewaters from Jiim
City. The implementation of effective wastewater management for the City of Jilin is planned,
in order to restore this river to a healthy state and to elevate its classification to a higher grade
than Class V or IV. A TOR has been prepared for the study of the overaU Songhua river water
qwity.
36.          Agricultural impacts along the pipeline transmission route from Maja to the city
are considered to be minor. Loss of one crop year may occur in some areas during construction
for which owners are well compensated. Disturbed soil along the route will selectively be
replaced in the trench in order to maintain agricultural productivity after construction has been
completed. Loss of agricultural land at water treatment plant No. 3 will impact a few area
farmers as the total land requirement is estimated at 10 hectares. However the positive impacts
on the City of Changchun because of increased available water should outweigh the negative
impact on agriculturl production (para. 3.29).
37.          Aesthetic impact will be minor because construction occurs in the rural
countryside for the most part. Water Treatment Plant No. 3 is located in the southeast extremity
of the city in a sparsely populated area. Therefore, there would be no impairment in aesthetic
appearance subsequent to construction completion.
38.          From a human interest point of view, the increase in available water supply of
good quality will improve the standard of living and social well being of the citizens of
Changchun. Availability of water to residents who have very little water at the present time will
impact positively on personal hygiene standards which will reflect in improved public health of
the overall community.
39.          The water supply project is essential to the City of Changchun in order to sustain
economic prosperity and to improve the stndard of living of the citizens. Both the short- and
long-term impacts resulting from environmental factors are minima! in comparison to the benefits
to be derived from providing additional water to the city in which consumption presently lags
demand by approximately 50 percent
Wastewater Management
40.          Wastewater management is a key component in the implementation of the
proposed water supply project. The essential elements by which environmental impacts have
been evaluated are ecology, health, recreation, aesthetics and agricuture. The ecological factors
concerned are river water quality, flora and fauna.



-89-                            ANNEX 10
41.          The Yitong, Ximkai, Yinma and Second Songhua rivers are presently polluted
because of the lack of wastewater treatment by Industries and cities. The City of Jilin has a
major impact on the Second Songhua River as does the City 3f Changchun.
42.          The staged implementation of pollution control for the Yitong drainage area will
remove from the receiving waters the majority of the waste loading contributed by the City of
Changchun. The primary water resources affected are South Lake and the Yitong River. The
secondary water resources affected are the Yimna River and the Second Songhua River at the
confluence and downstream. Initially the Yitong interceptor from south to north will be
completed together with a primary wastewater treatment plant at a capacity of 368,000 m3/d.
This will eliminate the discharge of setdleable solids to the river which has a major imract on
both the Yitong River fishery, water quality and public health. The ultimate goal for the
wastewater management project is to elevate the river classification of the Yitong to Class m or
H.
43.          At present the Yitong River (35-390 mg/l BOD5) is biologically unproductive in
terms of fish, benthic organisms and other aquatic life. In most instances the assimilative
capacity of the Yitong River and its tributary, the Yinma, appear to be exceeded most of the year
from downstream of Changchun to its confluence with the Second Songhua River. Within the
city, South Lake is heavily impaLted by wastewater discharges and exhibits poor water quality.
44.          Following the implementation of full treatment, establishing of industrial zones
and an effective industrial waste treatment program, the river eventually will still require
dredging in selected areas in order to remove toxic components such as heavy metals and
organics that have accumulated in the bottom and bankside sediments. For some time in the
future concern will remain over the consumption of fish because of the potential for bio-
accumulation in fish tissue which could pose a treat to public health. Similarly body contact
recreation is not recommended in the Yitong River or South Lake because of the concerns over
public health due to the gross pollution level.
45.          The rivers, streams, South Lak!e and other small ponds are aesthetically
displeasing from the standpoint of appearance and odor. Wastewater outfalls currently discharge
directly to these waters without any form of pretreatment.
46.          Although the health effects of utilizing Yitong River water for irrigation are not
known precisely, they can be inferred based on water quality information reviewed to date.
During May, when the irrigation season commences the Yitong River carries an enormous
quantity of industrial and domestic contamirants. The withdrawal of these waters for irrigation
use poses a high risk for the transfer of potentially toxic materials onto land and subsequently
into the food chain.
47.          The program proposed in this project for environmental protection in the first-
stage investment program (1991-95) is part of a realilic long-term strategic plan for
environmental remediation. Full implementation in the context of China's development is not
likely to succeed within a decade. Many other far-reaching measures and culture changes will
need to take place gradually. The program proposed includes the formation of a Wastewater
Company to address effective management, operation and control of the municipal and industrial
wastewaters generated within the City of Changchun. Other measures proposed include (a) the
construction of the Yitong interceptor and North Suburb Wastewater Treatnent Plant (WWTP),



- 9 -                           ANNEIC 
(b) mplemenaon of a ser use by-law and relao   to regulat and contol the dscrg
of industria ffluens to the seweage collection system and wat courses, (c) the Wastewaer
Company would handle appr       and licensing of all industriial efflut discharges in the six
countes administered by the City of Changchun, (d) revitalization of Changchun Eironmental
Ptection Bureau to underta  compliance monioring of industrial effluents not serviced by the
sewerage collection system, (e) the formation of indusrial parks and IndustW  treatmet centers
for small and medium size industry widtin the parka, (f) the impl tin of a toxic and
bazadous waste study to address bandling, treatment and disposal of toxic and hazadous wast,
and (g) to promote ambient water quality management of water bodies and rivers by the Song-
Liao Water Basin Admin     in i order to assess perfrmance of environmental protection
measures implemented.
48.          Althtough it is recognized that a primary wstewat treatment (30-35 percent
BOD removal; 50 percent SS removal) will not completely correct the pollution problems in the
receiving waters downstream from Changchun, it will minimize the negative impacts. It is the
intention of the local authority that after a few years of operation of the primary wastwaer
plant, a secondary biological wastewater treatment facilities will be constructed to fiuther treat
the wastewaters from the city. This staged approach seems to be a reasonable way to solve the
city's wastewater problem because it will mimize the financial burden for the city and also
obtaining necessary experiences on how to operate and manage a wastewater treatment network.
However, since the second stage of the wastwater management is beyond the scope of this
curnt, Xk. detailed EA was prepared. It is likely that this second stage wiUl be financed by
bilateral donors.
Enifronmental Management Plan
49.          The proposed activities during the preconstruction, construction and operational
phases result in a number of impacts on environment  components.  An appropriate
environmental management plan including a "resettlement action plan' has been Identified for
the mitigation of these potential adverse impacts. The major recommendations are summarized
in Table 1.
Relocation and Resettlement
50.          Chinese government policy on resettlement is, covered under national and
povincial laws and regulations. The policy provides for. social and economic reestablishnt
of communities, with living standards the same or better; resettlement within the same county,
and if possible, the same township; resumption of original employment or taining for
alternatives; compensation for property; and reconstruction of public facilities. It was estimated
that a total of 345.15 hectares of land will be affected because of this project. Of this, 55,25
hectares are permanent and 289.9 hectares are temporary. About 850 people are affected by the
project, about 550 persons will be resetled and about 300 persons will be losing famland. Ihe
total cost is estimated t- bk Y 54 million ($10 million). A OResettlement Action Plan" has been
prepared by the Changchun City goveent (Appendix K in the full EIA) to address this issue.
In-depth consultation with the affected people has taken place and the resettlement and
compenlsaton appears to be well done.

TOXIC/HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT AN
INDUSTRIAL PARK STUDES:
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE
Backrud
1.           Changchun Municipality, located in the northeast Province of Jiin, consists of
the City of Changchun, which is the seat of the Provincial govement, and five rural counties.
The Municipality has an area of 18,880 ka2. It has a population of 5.8 mfllion, of which 2.0
mmion are urban. The area has a temperate, continental monsoonal climate, with cold, long
witers, and warm, short, rainy summers. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 400 to
1,000 mm; the average amual precipitation is 700 mm. Jilin is one of the breadbaskets of
China. Agriculture is well-developed with large parts of farmland served by irrigation systems,
incorporatng several regulating and flood control dams. Changchun is also an industrial city
with    ominanl metal-worling facories and has a relatively large number of higher
education establishments. Currently, over 3,400 factories and enterprises are spread over the
city, including tractor, bicycle, railcar and instrument factories.
2.           Changchun Municipality reported that cwurenty the city generates about
5,000 tons per year cyanide from the No. 5 Chemical Plant, about 40,000 tons per year of boron
sludge from No. 1 Chemical Plant and approximately 5-10 tons per year of nitrobenzene ether
and aminobenzene ether from Changchun Pharmaceutical Factory. Landfill and incineration are
being used to dispose these toxic/hazardous wastes.
3.           It is ticipated that after the completion of the Changchun Water Supply and
Environmental Project, new industries and factories will be established and additional
toxiclhazardous wastes will be generated.
4.           Changchun Municipality recently commissioned the Changchun Urban Research
Insute to conduct a Changchun City Industrial Hazardous Wastes Management and Disposal
Site Selection and Feasibility Study. The Research Institute recommended Sandao, a location
about 6 kilometers east to the city with a disposal capacity of 315,000 cubic meters, to be the
toxic/hazardous wastes disposal site.
5.            angchun Municipality also commissioned the Changchun Planing Design
Instie   to conduct a Changchun Area Relocation Plan for Industries Generating Hazardous
Wastes. That study recommended relocation of electroplating, metallurgy, cement, tanning and
chemical industries to a common designated location outside the urban area. The recommended
location for these industries is in the north corner of the East Suburb indusil park, east of the
Outer Ring Highway and north of Shilibao. The proposed industrial park comprises



-96-                             A X  11
79.5 hectares, which is sufficient area for the existing 30 factories and allows room for fiuture
expansion.
6.           There are many uncertainties concerning the accuracy of the above two studies,
including: (a) only two sites were selected for comparison for the toxic/hazardous wastes
disposal study; and (b) the classification of toxic/hazardous wastes were not well defined-only
three types of wastes, cyanide, boron sludge and nitrobenzene ether and aminobenzene, were
considered in the study while other pollution generating industries such as electropladng,
metallurgy, cement, tanning and chemical industries were not included. During appraisal of the
Changchun Water Supply and Envionmental Project it was determined that a comp--.hensive
Toxic/Hazard Wastes Management and Industrial Park Study should be carried out.

MANAGEMENT ANID OPERATIONAL SUPPORT FOR
CHANGCHUN WATER SUPPLY COMPANY:
DRAFE DESCRIPTON
1.           There is a rewgnized need to manage in an optmum way te scarce waot
suply available for Cbanghu  City ad to operat at a minimum cost the highly negy
o      tive Insalflations of the Changcm Wat  Supply Compay (CWSC), while providig
an efficient, leastco serice to the people and industry of Changchun. With Increasing water
sarcity and having to transport waer over long disancs, improvemn  of technology and
efficiency Is necesy to provide a service at the lowest cost both in tem of energy and money.
2.           Water loss  and energy wastage in water supply comanies is due to a highy
complex number of fctors. System w        losses ar often given as the main indicator of
effiency in operaons. However, ner  losses are not only associated with water losses but
ao with            ate design, poor-alty matis and conruction pracdees, and
Inapproate oprtg   pmcedure for pps, teatment plan  and distrbn su stt-all of
which result in higher ta neesa  energy cost For example, poor         and lack of
a railitation program often rests in corrosion of water mis cau   incrased frtion and
reWting In higher energy cost. The process of opersating a wat supply system efficienly start
with desip and is a continous process of diligent management of construction, operaons and
Modern computeized management of adminIsae  and commercial opeao
is a basic necessity. Equally, water companies must contiuosy plan for the future, to meet
th             ip osed by the grwth of an industrialized city such as Changchun, which
requires high quality utility sevices for its Industrial development   well as for Is populton.
3.           During the recent decades, as cities have grwn, manageme  and techology
of agendcies providing municipal services have become more sophisticate. As a *asult,
opeaiona and financial management, and many differe  technologies used in watr supply
companies have become specialties In themselves. What used to be a relatively simple sernie
of providing water now demands well educated and tained people with many differet and
highly speciized skills. Those specialists should aso be trin  sotat they understand and
take account of the cost implications of ther actions.
4.           Woddwide, th urban water utility sector  ffers from resice to change and
adop   of modem  _manament practices and sat-of-the-a  techology. However, with the
growing peeptn of the problems of watr shoa, water polbion and related health
hazards, tee  is a growing reognition of the need for change. The cultural cbhn  fm a
basicaly rura-*iented operaon hito a modern water utility for a large idustrial city i often
a difficult undaking. Iherehre, a major goal of tis support palcage is to achieve atudo

provide a system operations and maintenace program, with the purpose
to improve the quality of the services provision of providing highquality
war (pH contol and particulate matter) at adequate pressures,
responsiveness to customers demands and complaints, distibution
system maitenane. Develop a progrm to increase awareness of the
importnce of efficient wat use, which incudes water qaity, water
distibution material standards and m nce practices,  pntinus
monitoring of water losses and unaccound for water, plumbing
standards for interior plumbing and water efficient equipment, both for
industry an domestic use. Particular attention should be given to the
upgrading of the dirict offices, which are the direct contact point wih
the customers.

7.           Assistance would be provided in the form of a small core team which would
make periodic (about six-month intervals) visits. The initW visit would be about two montis,
rng  which the core team would work closely with CWSC management and agree on an iditi
assessment and set out a flexible implementaton plan with ded TORs for intervins of
specialists. These speciaists would have the appropriate expertise and  tensive experience to
provide operationa and management advice in their particular field of expertise. Progress would
be reviewed annually in cooperation with IDA and the implementation plan would be adapted
to changing circumstances and progress made to date. The whole process of TA and insttutonl
change is esdmated to take place over the five-year project Implementtion per'od (1993-98),
including the initial phase of commissioning the new facilities
8.           The management of CWSC has committed itself to change the aizational
structure of CWSC to a new structure better adapted to the needs of the future. The TA would
assist in developing the job descriptions for the new institutonal argement. CWSC bas
agreed with IDA on an implementation of the new instituional arrangements by December 31,
1994.
9.          It is intended that CWSC, including its training facilities, will serve both as an
example and as a training ground for the Northeast of China. Participation of the China Water
Supply Associadon in the above proposed TA is also recommended.

MANAGEMENT AND O-PF4TIONAL SUPRT FOR
CHANGCHUN SEWkAGE COMPANY:
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE
ntrodueion
1.           A simdlar Techical Assistance program as for the Water Supply Company
will be needed for the recently fomd    Changwn Sewerage Company (CSC), which s a
newly created compay. Patiar attenton shuld be gien to design, conoucdon and
O&M of sewerap collectn systems becas excessive infiltrtion result In additonal
energy costs at pumping statin and at the treamnt plant. The control of poluto, in
paicular domestc and industri poluion, is the principle purpose of CSC. Water is scace
and is brought at high cost to Changcu   As a result, (a) water use is a cntint and Ob)
the absorpiv cacity of the  its water courses is very limited. Watet downsteam of
Chang8iun is reed by agriculture durng the crop growth peiods ad, therefre, toxic
waste disosa in the public waterus  dws d be controlled severely.
2.           The purpose of his TA is ta at the end of the project Imdlementation CSC,
together widi the Changchun            Ptection Bureau (CEPB) will be able to:
(a) operate ad maintan the Changchun sewage collection and transmission system,
(b) opae  the nwly conshucted pdmay treatnt plant and monitor its peform ane in
view of the design of the secondary reaent stage, and (c) together wih CEPB set
discharge lim, grant dsg permi and effectvely control the water qualy of the
industrial disrges inothe sewerag system.
Objectves
3.           The main objective of this proposed Techical Assistance (A) I to upgrade
the operaon and m_e capabilities of the CSC to ensure it is opeaed in the mot
efficien, cost-effecilve mamer possible, using consultants specialized in the management,
fnanci  administtio, and opeation and maitnc of muncipal wastewater management
system.
4.           Ihe following specific objectives are:
(a)    Industa waste dsdargs, permits and qualty contol of point
disdwggw
(i)  Deveop a data base to identify all industri discbarges. ITis will
identify the type of idustry, c  s    of waste dicharge, toxic
coi      s, etc.



-104 -                           ANE  2
(i) Develop criteria for pretreatment of wastes prior to discharge into the
public sewerage system. Permits would be issued for discharges.
(iii) Develop a munitoring system to randomly sample the discharges for
compliance.
(iv)  Develop laboratory capability to test for industral waste discharge
characteristics. Training aministars and laboratory technicians is
an integral part. This is a joint venture of CSC and CEPB.
(b)    Sewage collection system
(i)  A program should be drafted and guidance provided on ks
implementation to modernize maineance and rehabilitation of the
sewage collection and transmission system. Particular attention
should be paid to groundwater infiltration in view of the added
expense of pumping. Modem inspecdon, repair and rehabilitation
technology should gradually be introduced.
(ii) Develop a program to monitor dry and wet weather flows.
(iii) Detailed mapping of the existing system is a priority item in view of
the large extensions to be added over the next decade and the
necessary rehabilitation of the sewage system. A graphic information
system (GIS) should be developed to map the exising system.
(c)    Sewage Treatment Plant. Sewage treatment plant operation is a
sophisticated process, more so than water tement plant operations becase
of the highly variable flow and quality of the sewage, which easily upset the
bacteriological processes of a modern sewage treatment plant.
(Q)  Prepare an operations and mnance (O&M) manual for the plant.
Develop an organization chart, job classifications, and a certification
program for the operators.
(Hi) Train a core staff to operate the treatment plant. Develop an
organization chart, job classifications, and a certification program for
the operators.
(iii) Develop a monitoring program to check the efficiency of the
treatment process. Included would be:
*     Influent BOD, suspended solids, pH, tempature
*     Sediment tank BOD and suspended solids removal
*     Sludge production
*     Effluent BOD and suspended solids, pH
*     Digester performance



-105 -                          ANNEX 12
(d)    Financial management system. Review the company's requirements,
provide a plan and guide the implementation to gradually computerize the
company's financal system. This Is a particular opportune time as China is
shifting to commercial accounting systems. The TA should examine the
present Chinese system and tacing account of this shift, prepare a computer
systems design initially based on desktop computers. Operational cost control
and stock acounting is a priority item.
(e)   Personnel management and training. Review present practices and
recommend improvement of the present system. Particularly important is the
provision of assistance in setting up a training program and design of training
facilities for the company staff which will go hand in hand with the changes
resulting from the above-mentioned specific actions.
Execution of the Techical Assistance
5.           The assistance would be provided in the form of a small core team which
would make periodic (about six-month intervals) visits. The initial visit would be about two
months, during which the core team would work closely with CSC management and agree on
an initial assessment and set out a flexible implementation plan with detailed TORs for
interventions by specialists. These specialists would have the appropriate expertise and
extensive experience to provide operational and management advice in their particular field of
expertise. Progress would be reviewed annually in cooperation with IDA and the
mplementation plan would be adapted to changing circumstances and progress made to date.
The whole process of TA and change is estimated to take place over the five-year project
implementation period (1993-98), including the initial phase of commissioning the new
facilities
6.           The management of CSC has committed itself to adopt an organizational
structure adapted to the needs of the operations. The TA would develop job descriptions for
this institutional arrangement.
7.           The estimated minimum labor requirements for the TA are:
