MEMORANDUM AND RECOIMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUT DIRECTORS
ON A ]PROPOSED DEVELOPNMENT CREDfT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR THE CHANGCHUN WATER SUPPLY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed Development Credit to the People's Republic of China (PRC) for SDR 86.6 million
($120 million equivalent) to help finance a Changchun Water Supply and Environmental Project.
The proposed Credit would be on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 35 years, including
a grace period of ten years. The Government of China would make the proceeds available to
the Changchun Municipality. The Municipality would onlend the proceeds: (a) to the Changchun
Water Supply Company (CWSC) at the Bank's variable rate plus a spread of 1.5 percent per
annum with 15 years maturity including a grace period of S years; and (O) to the newly created
Changchun Sewerage Company (CSC) at a fLxeti rate of 5.1 percent per annum with 15 years
maturity including a grace period of 5 years. CWSC and CSC would bear a fixed commitment
charge of 0.5 percent and assume the foreign exchange risk.
2.           Country/Sector Background.  China has made considerable progress in
hanessing its rivers and in constucting water supply systems for its urban populations. In 1949
there were only 59 cities with water supplies with a total capacity of 2.4 million cubic meters
(m) per day, providing water to only 9 million people. In 1986, 302 cities had potable water
supplies with a capracity of about 42 million ni3 per day. To this should be added the water
supply developed and used by industries with a capacity of about 63 million ni3 per day. It is
estimated that now practically all major cities (353) have water supply systems which provide,
mostly through house connections, the minimum necessay supply of water to their populations
and industry. Water supply coverage in small county towns is markedly different. In 1989 it
was reported that only 26% of those towns (3,068 towns) had water supply facilities, serving
about 50 milion people. Only about 30 percent of the roughly 770 million rura population has
adequate water supply. The recently approved Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project
focuses on this sub-sector (Credit No. 2336-CHA, approved February 2, 1992).
3.           Urban sewerage services are very basic, with almost no water pollution control
ficilities. In the past, China has successfully dealt with the human waste problem through
nightsoil collection systems which reused waste as fertilizer. However, the rapid growth of the
cities has created a siuation that can no longer be dealt with in the traditional manner.
4.           Very large investments will be made in the water supply and sewerage sectors
in China over the next decade and beyond. It can be assumed that the urban population now
served with water supply and sewerage systems is about 120 million and thatthis should increase
to 600 million Qess than 50 percent of the total Chinese population) by 2010. This is an increase
of 480 million people to be served. A minimum investment of $150 per person to be served
would imply an investment of $72 billion over 20 years, or roughly $3.6 billion per year. I-
the implementation of such a large program, there is potential for wasting resources and there
is a need for increased operaing efficiency, improved consruction practices and operation and
maintenan. Chinese urban irsftiutions tend to be comparalized and somewhat inefficient.
They are organized in the socialistic, centralized model, with primary emphasis on growth or



production, and little on operating efficiency, including maintenance. There is, therefore, a need
for better sector analysis and policy formulation - technical as well as financial, which would
lead to rational prioritization of investments and improvements in sector organization and
management.
5.           Changchun Municipality, located in the northeast Province of Jilin, has a
population of 5.8 million, of which 2.0 million are urban. Jilin province is one of the
breadbaskets of China and Changchun is an industrial city with predominantly metal-working
factories. Currently, over 3,400 factories and enterprises are spread over the city, including
tractor, bicycle, railcar and instrument factories. Changchun has been targeted for development
as a major vehicle manufacturing center, and to this end a new plant is being constructed to
manufacture 100,000 automobiles (Volkswagen) a year by 1995.
6.           Urban and industrial growth in Changchun are increasing water supply demand,
resulting in serious water shortages. Current potential water demand is estimated to be about
800,000 m3 per day. Existing water treatment capacity is only 400,000 m3 per day. Water
demand is projected to grow to about 1,000,000 rm3 per day by 1995. About 90) percent of the
population is served by direct service connections and only through extensive water conservation
measures has CWSC been able to keep the distribution system continuously pressurized.
Changchun Municipality thus needs to make major investments in its water supply system to be
able to provide the water supply service level necessary for economic and industrial growth. In
so doing, it must deal with two major problems: (a) the serious shortages in water supply and
(b) the rapidly increasing water pollution. To this end, a long-erm detailed Water Supply
Master Plan was developed and priority investments identified for Changchun Municipality. The
investment proposals included additional water transmission mains, water treatment and
distribution facilities and institutional development to strengthen CWSC. Key elements of the
Plan would be supported under the proposed I -oject.
7.          In 1988, a study for a Changchun Water Production Project was completed by
three local design institutes. At the suggestion of IDA during the preparation phase, the project
expanded from a straight-forward investment project for water production for Changchun to a
comprehensive action and investment plan in water supply and pollution control for the city.
As a result, a feasibility study was undertaken by international consultants funded by the
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).
8.           Changchun faces also an urgent need to provide for adequate collection and
appropriate disposal of domestic and industrial wastewater. Because it is located in an area with
limited water resources, water resources management and pollution control are much more
important to Changchun than for the coastal areas. Extensive water reuse and water conservation
measures are, therefore, necessary in tandem with establishment of an effective regulatory and
enforcement framework for water conservation and poilution control. To address this need, a
Mlaster Plan for Changchun Wastewater Engineering has been prepared. The Plan includes a
20-year program of investments for trunk sewers and treatment facilities, as well the
establishment of CSC, creation of industrial estates, separation of housing from work places, and
development of a hazardous waste management program. Priorities identified by the Master Plan
would be supported under this project.
9.           Rationale for IDA Involvement. The focus of IDA involvement in cities like
Changchun is to support and implement the Central Government's program of decetralization
and delegation of responsibility, inclvding the financing of water supply and sanitation services
to municipalities and development of ufflcient service delivery. Although IDA financing of civil



-3 -
works and equipment is the vehicle, institutional strengthening and reform, leading to efficient
use of resources and cost recovery, are the goals of this project.  Dispersed sector
responsibilities and low priority for operation and maintenance are currently the key problems
confronting the Municipality as it strives to adequately plan and manage scarce financial, human,
and water resources. In addition, water supply and pollution control technology, at all levels,
need to be upgraded drastically to meet the growing need for high quality urban services.
10.         Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Group Operations. The Bank Group
is involved in a number of projects in China's urbad development, water supply and environment
sectors, which deal to varying degrees with enviromnental pollution control. Ongoing projects
include the Shanghai Sewerage Project, the Medium-Sized Cities Development Project, the
Liaoning Urban Infrastructure Project, and the Beijing Environmental Project. In addition, the
Tianjin Urban Development and lEnvironment Project was recently approved by the Board.
These projects have for the most part proceeded satisfactorily, with timely implementation.
Instiutional and financial/commercial reform have been confirmed to be the major issues to be
addressed by the Bank Group through sector work combined with sector lending operations.
11.         Project Objectives. 'Te project objectives are to: (a) improve water supply
in Changchun Municipality to meet the domestic needs of the urban population and to support
ndustrial growth; (b) reduce industrial and domestic water pollution through physical works,
strengthening of institutions, development of regulations, improvements in operational
management, and changes in pricing policy; and (c) create a demonstration project, where the
lessons learned can be shared with other municipalities in China. The institutional strengthening
objective will adist Changchun Municipality in establishing appropriate sector institutions,
policies and regulations. The project attempts to concentrate comprehensive water supply
activities in the CWSC, with a similar plan to concentrate urban water pollution control activities
being adopted for the recently established CSC. These actions should result in efficient use of
water resources, more prudent investment decisions, and strengthened planning and operational
capabilties for CWSC and CSC.
12.          Project Description.  The project's physical works would include (a)
construction of a water transmission pipeline to convey water from the Second Songhua River
to an impounding reservoir currently serving Changchun; construction of pumping stations,
expansion and improvement of water treatment facilities and expansion of the capacity of the
water distribution system; and (b) construction of a trunk interceptor sewer and a primay
sewage treatment plant and procurement of equipment and instruments for environmental quality
monitoring and control. Technical assistance would also be provided to assist with design and
construction supervision, to furnish management support to the water and sewerage companies,
to prepare a staff training program and to implement a hazardous waste study. Institutionally,
the project would reinforce the CWSC, develop the CSC, strengthen water pollution control,
establish appropriate pricing policies and operation practices, promote measures for water
conservation and improve personnel management, including training of staff. Well organized
water supply companies, operating on an efficient and commercial basis, must be assured when
consideration is given to expansion of urban water supply or introduction of water pollution
control services. Only in this way can cost recovery and operational objectives be achieved.
This project is an important step in addressing these issues and establishing a pilot operation as
well as opening a dialogue with the Chinese authorities.
13.         ProJect Implmentation. The proposed project would be carried out by the
Changchun Water Supply and Environmental Project Management Office (PMO) located in
CWSC. The project cost is estimated at $251.4 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange



-4-
component of $125.1 million equivalent. The total financing required, including interest during
construucion, is $266.3 million, of which IDA would finance $120 million equivalent (94 percent
of the foreign exchange and 45 percent of the total). Retroactive financing of up to $3 million
for expenditures incurred after May 31, 1992 is recommended, covering possible initial civil
works and goods contracts, and the design/supervision consultancy contract, that are of urgent
nature to be able to start full scale construction at the beginning of the 1994 season, when the
frost is ended. A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in China ale given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The
Staff Appraial Report, No. 11040-CHA dated December 30, 1992, is being distributed
separately.
14.          Agreed Actions. Jilin Province has agreed to maintain and regularly inspect the
Xinlicheng Reservoir. Changchun Municipality hb3 agreed to: (a) maintn a PMO with staffing
and facilities acceptable to IDA; (b) cause the PMO to submit quarterly progress reports to IDA,
and to submit an annual summary report and semiannual reports on main developments and
changes in the corporate plars of CWSC and CSC; (c) with the assistance of CWSC and CSC
rzt-ttle the persons affected by the project in a manner and according to a schedule which is
satisactory to IDA; (d) maintain and regularly inspect the Shitoukoumen Reservoir; (e) make
CWSC responsible for water supply and sewerage billing and collection; (f) have CWSC and
CSC implement by December 31, ,994, a program for computerized planning, biling and
forecasting, and provide by December 1 of each year one copy of the forecasting projections to
IDA, and implement by December 31, 1994, a management information system, with monthly
iformation on water demand, revenues and costs and every six months provide an updated copy
of such projections to IDA; (g) gradually end all commercial and domestic exemptions from
sewerage fees, and completely end the practice by the time the project is completed; (h) levy a
charge of Y 10 per square meter on new construction; (i) ensui7e that both CWSC and CSC
would generate sufficient revenue to cover operation and maitenac  cost, including interest,
plus depreciation or debt service, whichever is the higher, and that CWSC and CSC wiUl be able
to retain all profits during construction and debt repayment periods; and G) will enae
consultants to conduct a study of toxic and hazardous waste management and industrW
relocation, to be completed by December 31, 1995, and wiUl implement the plan for industrial
relocation. CWSC and CSC have agreed to contract consultants by December 31, 1993 to assist
in improving the management and operations of CWSC and CSC, on terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA, and carry out an agreed action plan, with timing satisfactory to IDA.
1S.          Environmental Aspects. The project has been classified as a Category B project
by IDA. An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was prepared by consultans in 1991,
which has been found acceptable by IDA. The EIA found, inter alia, that there would be minor
impacts on vegetation and wildlife along the routes of pipelines, minor impacts on funa and
flora in the Chau and Yitang Rivers from the intebasin transfer of water, and thaw' Aill be a
need in the future to introduce wastewater treatment in Jimin City to ensure that the local water
quality of the Songhua River to the confluence with the Yitang River is not diminished. The
Project involves tributaries to the Songhua River, which eventually flows into an international
waterway. Ihe Bank staff has made an assessment that the Project would not cause any
appreciable harm to other riparians. Project preparation included preparation of a land
acquisitionplan and related resettlement plan for the approximately 800 project-affected persons.
Land acquisition will take place in accordamce with th e State Land Magement Laws and
Regulations. Resettlement is being addressed by Changchun Municipality and Jilin Province.
Carrying out of a Resettlement Plan acceptable to the Association is required under the Project.

16.          Project Benefits. The project would make sigifiant iprovements to the water
supply needed to sustain economic growth and improve thc standard of living in Changchun as
wel as the management and operation of the CWSC. The project's sewerage investments would
signficantly reduce pollution of streams and rivers in Changchun and establish the framework
for municipal and industi wastewater management for the future. Ihe combined Economic
Inernal Rate of Retum (EIRR) for the project is estimated at 13 percent, while the EIRR for the
water supply and sewerage components are esfimated at 10 and 21 percent respectively.
17.          Risks. Project risks are mostly in the execution of the water pollution control
works and regulatory reform and enforcement. Much better understanding by the local
authorities of the consequences of the present domestic and industrial pollution in Changchun has
been gained over the last two years. The strong competition for investment funds for directly
productive purposes and the ongoing program of investments to replace outdated production
technology may, however, affect the priority given by the Government for investments in
pollution control. Water resource shortages affect the living conditions of almost everyone in
the urban and rural areas of Changchun and, therefore, also the economy of the Province. As
a result there is strong commitment by both the Provincial and the Municipal governments to
support appropriate measures to improve the situation.
18.          Reforms in pricing are required to ensure that the desired benefits are generated.
As these changes affect a wide range and number of provincial and municipal government
agencies, difficulty in the implementation of the reforms may be expected. Finally, there is a
risk that delays may occur in implementation of the physical works of the project because
Changchun Munihipality, CWSC and CSC have never taken up an investment program of this
scale in the past; thus, the agreed emphasis on a strong PMO, backed up by experienced
consultants.
19.          Reconmeudatlon. I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Associ:ion and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.
