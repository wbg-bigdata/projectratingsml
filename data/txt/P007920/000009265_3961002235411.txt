MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRSSIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN OF US$23 MILLIOV
TO TIE REPUBLIC OF PARAGUAY
FOR THE TRIP') RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
1.   I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recomendation on
a proposed loan to the Republic of Paraguay for the equivalent of US$23 million
to help finance a rural water and sanitation project. The lean would be at the
Bank's standard variable rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including a 5 year
grace period.
2.   Backoround. Paraguay, a landlocked country with 4n area of 407,000 kms2, is
predominantly agricultural with a low population density. it had one of the best
economic performance records in Latin America during the 1960s and 1970s. During
the 1980s, economic growth declined, and was further hampered by a deterioration
in economic policies and poor public sector investments.   Recent political
developments as well as past investments offer an opj.iQi.i-Uiy for high growth
rates and financial stability.   The 1991 total population of Paraguay is
estimated at 4.3 million people, with only 34% of the population living in urban
centers of more than 4,000 inhabitants.   The annual population growth rate
between 1980 and 1990 was 3.1% p.a., and is expected to remain so for the rest
of the decade.  Geographical distribution is very uneven.  About 98% of the
population is concentrated in 14 departments in the eastern region, whereas only
2% are located in 5 departments in the western region.
3.   Paraguay is characterized by unacceptably low coverage in basic water
services. Currently, only 24% of its population (1 million people) has access to
safe water, one of the lowest service levels in the Region. Levels of service
vary greatly between urban and rural areas. Some 46% of the urban population and
about 8% of the rural population (0.23 million people) enjoy water supply
services. This compares unfavorably with an average of 84% in urban ana 50% in
rural areas of the Region. The recent findings of the Bank Public Expenditure
Review reveal that waterborne diseases are the major cause of infant mortality.
4.   Rationale for Bank Involvement.   The proposed project is a continuation
of two earlier Bank-financed projects, and builds on experience gained under
those projects. The project responds to the correctly identified priority of
providing safe water to the rural population. Expansion of water services to the
rural population addresses our country assistance objective of providing an
adequate level of services in rural areas so as to mitigate the rural/urban
transition that Paraguay could likely face in the future. Project implementation
strategy will employ the same model that led to successful community
participation that permitted these water projects to be highly sustainable.
5.   Protect Obiectives.  The main objective of the project is to improve rural
productivity and health, particularly of women and children, by expanding access
to potable water and environmental sanitation facilities.  The project will
assist the Government ins (a) organizing a sector financing system based on more
reliance on water users self-financing capability; (b) providing potable water
and sanitation facilities to about 250,000 people through house connections and



- 2 -
other low-cost technologies; (c) stv,' ithening SENASA' s capability and the Juntas
for project implementation.
6.  Project Descriotion.  The project would consist of: (a) building water
supply systems benefiting about 230,000 people (72% of project cost); (b)
provision and improvement of sanitation to about 250,000 people (9O of project
cost); (C) provision of water supply to about 20,000 of the dispersed rural
population and indigenous settlements through low-cost appropriate technologies
(8% of project cost); (d) a technical assistance program to strengthen SENABA's
capacity to implement the project (4% of project cost); and (e) provision of
well-drilling equipment and spare parts, tools for regional repair shops, office
equipment, vehicles for project implementation, and supervision (7% of project
cost).
7.   Proiect Financina.    The total cost of the project is US$36.3 million
equivalent. The proposed Bank loan of US$23.0 million equivalent would finance
about 64% of the project costs, repre2enting the foreign exchange requirements.
User contributions would amount to US$9.0 million, and SENA8A would participate
with US$4.3 million.
8.   Prdiect Ilolementation.  Rural water and sanitation activities in Paraguay
are handled by SENASA, an agency of the Ministry of Health, which, besides its
activities in the water sector, is also responsible for controlling general
environmental problems. Rural water supply projects are implemented through the
creation of Local Sanitation Committees (Juntas) within the communities. These
Juntas actively participate in the construction and financing of water supply and
sanitation systems. Once the systems are built, the Juntas fully administer,
operate, and maintain their system. The Juntas also service the debt on their
loan from SENASA and maintain a special fund for replacing equipment and major
repairs. SENASA provides technical assistance to the Juntas during the initial
phase of the operation and supervises them during the life of the loan. SENASA's
strategy for implementing rural water and sanitation services is well conceived.
9.  To strengthen SENaSA's capabilities to carry out the proposed project, a
strong Technical Assistance Program was agreed. The program would consist of
long- and short-term consultant experts who would assist SENASA in managerial,
technical, and financial aspects of project execution. The prograa would provide
intensive training of SBNASA's personnel at all levels in financial, technical,
and social promotion aspects. There would be a specific training program for
field workers, including special study programs in other countries. The Pan
American Health Organization (PAEO) and UNDP will assist the proposed technical
assistance program by providing international consultants through their regular
programs. Both agencies have coordinated technical assistance programs during
project implementation of the two previous Bank-financed projects.
10   The project would be executed between 1992 and 1997.  This schedule is
compatible with SENASA' s execution capabilities strengthened by their new
organizational structure and by the proposed technical assistance program.
SEMASA has already completed socioeconomic surveys for about 230 communities and
engineering designs for 90 water systems.  Hydrogeological studies and water
sources have been completed for about 24 water systems. SENASA is using project



engineering designs as well as levels of service, standards and specifications
developed under the previous projects.
11   Project Sustainabilitv.  The proposed project would support an integrated,
community-based water systems strategy, that has proven to be highly sustainable.
As requested by sector authorities, the project would be a follow-up of the
Bank's strategy of community participation.   It would serve the municipal
districts and the largest concentrated communities of the rural population
applying the following selection criteria: (a) a Junta must be set up in each
community tos (i) participate in the planning and construction of the system,
(Ui) to take responsability for the debt service and (iii) to be in charge of the
administration, operation and maintenance of the system; (b) to have completed
water source studies; and (c) per capita construction cost should be less than
US$110. A special project component would also establish the basis for providing
watea. and sanitation services through low-cost technologies to che small and
dispersed rural population and to indigenous settlements of the country.
12. Lessons from Previous Dank Involvement. The Bank has helped SENASA in the
execution of water and sanitation pr-grams for the rural population through
loans: 1S02-PA. for US$6 million in FY77, and 2014-PA for US$11.8 aillion in FY81,
which were completed in 1983 and 1990, respectively. in the early 1970s, water
and sanitation services in Paraguay wwre iary low. Only Asunci6n and a few other
cities had public water and sanitatlLon services. A worse situation was found in
the rural areas, where only about 10 rural coamunities had adequate water
services. The main objectives of the Bank loans were to support the development
of an adequate institutional capacity and to increase community participation.
At project completion of the two projects, about 100 water systems had been
built, providing safe water and sanitation facilities to more than 140,000
people.  The most important outcomes of the projects were their impact on
community participation and the adequate operational and maintenance practices
of the water systems.   The Bank has learned key lessons ro be applied in this
project including the need to: (a) maintain and increase the participation of the
communities in project financing; (b) provide for the repayment of the loans from
the Juntas to SENASA in real terms to create a revolving fund for further sector
expansion; (c) build suitable mechanisms to ensure that funds and technology will
be available to the Juntas for major repairs; and (d) strengthen SENASA for the
provision of adequate and timely support and supervision to the Juntas.
13. issues and Actions to be Aareed. The main issues ares (a) implementation
of the newly agreed organizational structure of SENASA to execute the project and
to provide support to the Juatas; (b) execution of the agreed technical
assistance program; and (c) SENAA's capacity to manage financial resources for
sector expansion. During neaotiations, it was agreed from the Government that:
(i) SMNASA will be permitted to manage financial resources obtained from subloan
repayments according to the results of the study on the Revolving Fund; (ii)
SENaAS will execute a technical assistance program and review jointly with the
Bank its results one year after project initiation.   As a condition  of
effectiveness it was agreed that SINSA should (iii) present to the BDak sample
bidding documents and procedures and a procurement schedule covering calendar
years 1992 and 1993.



14. Environmental Aspects. The project would provide safe water and promote
improved personal hygiene and excreta disposal. It will also provide urgent
preventive measures targeted to the rural population to stem the threat of
cholera, which is spreading rapidly in the Region. No adverse effects to the
eavironment are expected from the project; on the contrary, surface levels of
soil coatamination would be reduced due to an expansion of latrinisa'ion in the
rural areas.   This project has been classified as Envirozmental Assessxent
Category "B"
15. Boai£t. The proposed project would ameliorate the living and health
conditions of the rural population by providing potable water and sanitation
facilities. since obtaining water for the family is generally the responsibility
of women in the rural communities of Paraguay, improved access to water supply
and adequate sanitation would have a positive and direct impact on the quality
of life and productivity of rural women.
16. Risks. There are no unusual project risks. The major risk concerns the
limited capacity of SENASA to carry out a project of this magnitude in a timely
way. During project preparation, SENASA has already made substanuial improvements
in its organization. It is expected that through the strong tecbnical assistance
program its implementation capacity will be sufficiently strengthened to
implement the project as planned.
17. Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the i\rticles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
apprcve the proposed loan.
