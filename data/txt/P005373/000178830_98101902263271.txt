REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
To THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED THIRD LOAN TO THE
CREDIT IMMOBILIER ET HOTELIER WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A HOTEL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Credit Immobilier et Hotelier (CIH) with the guarantee of the Kingdom of
Morocco for the equivalent of US$25.0 million, to help finance tourism develop-
ment in Morocco. Amortization would conform substantially to the aggregate of
the amortization schedules applicable to the specific investment projects to be
financed out of the proceeds of the loan, which would not exceed 20 years. The
interest rate would be 8.5 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Morocco"
(1021-MOR, dated January 26, 1976) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on February 13, 1976.
3.        During the 1968-72 Plan, Morocco succeeded in accelerating the
growth of its economy and in improving the situation of its external payments.
Aided substantially by good crops following favorable weather in three years
out of five, real GOP growth averaged 5.6 percent per annum during the five-
year period. Reflecting the sustained rise in exports during the Plan period
and a slower growth of imports in 1971 and 1972, the balance of payments
showed a surplus from 1969 onward. These results represented a definite im-
provement over those of the preceding decade, during which the rate of real
GDP growth had barely exceeded that of population growth, and the balance of
payments had been a source of constant concern. These achievements were ac-
companied by an increase in private consumption averaging about 2 percent
per capita in real terms during the five-year period.
4.        From 1967 to 1970, the main growth determinants had been exports,
tourism and investment, all of which rose substantially; in addition sizeable
stocks were accumulated following the exceptionally good harvest in 1968. By
contrast, in 1971-72 exports and tourism together with current government
spending were the major factors to sustain economic growth. During these
last two years of the Plan, the investment of public and semi-public enter-
prises declined, largely because the state-owned phosphate company (OCP) had
completed its expansion program. Government investment stagnated after 1968.
Private investors adopted a wait-and-see attitude in the face of political
developments in 1971 and 1972 and in the expectation of new measures to en-
courage investment and exports. At the end of the 1968-72 Plan period,
there was therefore an urgent need to revive public and private investment.
Particularly, in the public sector, absorptive capacity needed to be in-
creased by appropriate changes in staffing and organization.

of their official duties. Is contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.

5.        Following a long period of very slow growth in private consumption,
social problems had to be tackled. Over the 1960-71 period, there had been
a slow but perceptible decline in real per capita consumption for about one-
third of the rural population. Wealth and income differences between cities
and villages, among regions, and between rich and poor tended to widen. Un-
employment remained high, in 1971 averaging 9 percent of the country's labor
force, and ranging between 12 and 16 percent in large urban centers.
6.         Recognizing these difficulties and problems, the Government began
in 1971 to revise its development policies, paying increasing attention to
social objectives. The changed orientations were reflected in the 1973-77
Plan which aims at (1) GDP growth of 7.5 percent per annum in real terms
from 1973 to 1977, mainly through a sharp increase in public and private
investment and a strategy geared strongly toward increasing exports; and
(2) an improvement in the distribution of growth benefits among the different
social groups and the various regions, in order to achieve greater equity and
at the same time increase domestic demand. This improvement was to be brought
about through further land distribution to poor farmers, more emphasis on the
development of rainfed agriculture, "Moroccanization" of some industrial and
commercial enterprises, a price and wage policy designed to enable the poorest
segments of the population to satisfy their essential needs, an ambitious pro-
gram of low-cost housing, various measures to improve the lot of the rural
poor, and increased emphasis on the development of poorest regions.
7.        During the first two years of the 1973-77 Plan, the main development
policies proposed in the Plan were introduced. Further, in 1974, Morocco ben-
efitted from a steep rise in the price of phosphate, its main export product,
which provided substantial additional resources compared to the Plan's expec-
tation. The Government decided to step up investment spending for the years
1975-77, partly to reflect cost increases for the development program already
adopted and partly to embark on additional investment projects.
Recent Economic Performance
8.         In 1973, exports were the only dynamic element in the economy, and
real GDP grew less than 3 percent. Agricultural output declined by 11 percent
due to drought. Investment rose 3 percent in real terms, because of an insuf-
ficient number of fully prepared projects, the late publication of the 1973-77
Plan and new investment incentives.
9.         In 1974, by contrast, the economy registered a strong recovery
(GDP grew by 10 percent) supported by all growth determinants; agricultural
output rose by 14 percent, thanks to good weather conditions and expansion
of irrigation; fixed investment increased by 34 percent in real terms due to
public sector investment and the implementation of new incentives for semi-
public and private investors, and stocks were replenished; exports (including
non-factor services) grew by 14 percent; and Government consumption rose by
more than 20 percent at constant prices.



- 3 -
10.       The revival of economic activity in 1974 was accompanied by further
improvements in the balance of payments. There was a sharp increase in phos-
phate export earnings from $192 million in 1973 to $932 million in 1974, due
to a 345 percent rise in average export price and a 16 percent growth in
quantities exported. This and a further large (52 percent) increase in
workers' remittances from Europe were the main factors behind a doubling of
the current surplus to $237 million in 1974, in spite of increased import
payments for foodstuffs and petroleum. The current surplus enabled Morocco
to increase short-term financing of its exports to facilitate sales, and to
raise the level of its external reserves. These reached $454 million at the
end of 1974.
11.       Some weak spots should be noted, however.     These are:  the increased
burden (5.4 percent of GDP in 1974) of price subsidies for imported foodstuffs
and petroleum; the volume decline of agricultural exports and the high level
of import requirements for wheat, sugar, edible oils and dairy products; the
increasingly felt shortage of skilled manpower, particularly at mid-level of
technical and managerial qualifications; and the rather low level of reserves
in relation to imports (2.4 months at the end of 1974).
12.       Available indicators show that the economic and financial situation
was less favorable in 1975 than it was in 1974. Two factors in particular
have held back economic growth. These are: (a) a decline in phosphate ex-
ports and downward pressure on phosphate prices, and (b) less favorable
weather conditions in 1974/75 than in 1973/74 which caused a decline estimated
at 10 percent in agricultural output. However, the growth of fixed investment
and the Government's current expenditures continued at the rapid pace that
began in 1974. On balance, real GDP.growth was only an estimated 2 percent
in 1975. At the same time, the internal and external financial situation has
tightened compared to 1974. The Government's budget showed a substantially
increased overall deficit, due to sharply rising current and capital spending.
Despite smaller import price rises and a substantial increase in external
borrowing, the balance of payments should register for the full year a very
small surplus only. Reserves would be about 2 months of 1975 imports by the
end of 1975. The difficulties experienced in 1975 should be temporary. A
recovery of output and exports is expected in 1976 for the agriculture and
phosphate sectors, which should provide the real resources for a further
increase in investment. This and greater fiscal discipline likely to be
introduced with the 1976.budget law would enable the, country to ease the
financial situation by comparison with 1975.
Revisions to the 1973-77 Plan
13.       The Government revised upward the 1973-77 Plan allocations for
the years 1975-77. Government investment appropriations for the five-year
period have been raised to DH 25.6 billion (about $6.4 billion) compared to
the original DH 11.8 billion. Of the DH 13.8 billion increase, changes to
original projects and cost increases represent DH 4.6 billion and new
projects for 1975-77, DH 9.2 billion. Excluding defense, new projects
fall in the following main categories:



- 4 -
DH 2,500 million for regional development;
Dli 1,600 million for transport and communications;
DH 1,300 million for agriculture and water development;
DH 400 million for industry;
DH 150 million (to be raised to more than DH 300 million depend-
ing on implementation capacity) for low-cost housing; and
DH 200 million for social services.
Since planning is indicative only for the semi-public and private sector, the
above allocations do not include investments by this sector. Nevertheless,
the Plan revisions contain provisions to prepare for the implementation of
two large industrial complexes (chemicals and steel) in the semi-public
sector, and expect a vigorous investment growth in the private sector. The
State Secretariat for Planning estimates that total investment at current
prices could jump from DH 4.2 billion in 1974 to DH 12.0 billion in 1977.
This would enable the country to meet the original GDP growth target of 7.5
percent a year for the 1973-77 period.
14.       The thrust of the Plan revisions seem justified.     Indeed, the
achievement of initial (especially social) Plan objectives is eminenty desir-
able. Similarly, Morocco's economy has developed to a stage where heavy in-
dustry should begin to find a place. The country possesses an obvious com-
parative advantage in the processing of phosphates, which would tend to
stabilize export earnings. However, the Plan revisions raise several issues
of importance for Morocco's long-term development strategy and prospects.
15.       The steep investment growth foreseen by the plan revisions could
exceed the country's absorptive capacity. Following the revival noted in
1974 and 1975, investment in real terms would rise by 39 percent in 1976 and
19 percent in 1977, and continue at very high rates in following years accord-
ing to the tentative plans for heavy industry. Availability of skilled man-
power constraint can only be relieved gradually by training. For large in-
dustrial and infrastructure projects, Morocco may be able to use foreign
services more extensively than in the past, but at considerable cost. In
addition, the Government will have to ensure that the increase in capital
intensity implied by the moves into heavy industry would be compatible
with the objectives for increasing opportunities for unskilled employment.
16.       Financial resources may also restrain investment growth.     The
analysis of Morocco's financial prospects shows that such resources would
grow relatively slowly in the next five years. Export earnings are likely
to be restrained by a decline in phosphate prices, and as a result, the
phosphate company's savings which are a large share (36 percent in 1974) of
national savings would be restrained. Taking into account the objective and



- 5 -
policies to improve consumption levels of low-income groups, the growth rate
of national savings may be expected to be relatively low. In spite of planned
efforts to increase budgetary savings and food import substitution, foreign
exchange and national savings are likely to become a constraint on investment
towards the end of the decade.
17.       Despite the uncertainty over the future evolution of phosphate ex-
port receipts, it is likely that investment growth will still reach close to
13.5 percent p.a. on average during the 1973-77 Plan period. It would exceed
the original plan targets for 1973-77, but remain below the revised targets.
Provided the volume of phosphate exports recovers in 1976, real GDP gains
would average about 6.5 percent yearly during the five years. Private per
capita consumption would rise by about 3.5 percent a year, which should
correspond to a net improvement in the situation of low-income groups.
Despite heavy external borrowing, the balance of payments would remain strong
until 1977. These results would be satisfactory by comparison with the ini-
tial objectives of the 1973-77 Plan for output and consumption growth, and
for the balance of payments.
18.       For the 1978-80 period, however, projected trends call for caution.
Taking into account the absorptive capacity and resource availability con-
straints, investment growth could slow down to around 10 percent a year in
real terms. Such growth and assumed export increases would lead to growth of
real GDP of about 7 percent a year, and of private per capita consumption of
about 2.5 percent. Import requirements for consumption and especially in-
vestment would grow rapidly, and with the likely deterioration in terms of
trade, the economy's resource gap would widen substantially during the last
three years of the decade. To cover it and service accumulated debt, ex-
ternal borrowing requirements on a commitment basis would need to average
more than $700 million annually in 1978-80, compared to an actual $553 mil-
lion in 1974 and an estimated annual average of $540 million in 1975-77.
Morocco's borrowing capacity seems sufficient to mobilize these amounts
from available sources, provided the necessary effort in project preparation
for external financing is made. The bulk of borrowings up to 1980 would be
from official, bilateral and international sources.
19.       External debt and debt service would increase as a result of pro-
jected borrowings. Debt outstanding and disbursed would rise from $1.0 bil-
lion at the end of 1974 to $2.6 billion at the end of 1980. Debt service
would go from $121 miLlion in 1974 to some $464 million in 1980. Debt service
would remain manageable, rising to 11 percent of exports (including non-factor
services) in 1980, from 6 percent in 1974. The prolongatLon beyond 1980 of
macro-economic trends foreseen during 1976-80 indicates that external borrow-
ing requirements would remain large, due in particular to the rise in import
needs for investment. These would lead to substantial debt service obliga-
tions, since an increasing share of external borrowing would come from com-
mercial sources. However, with an additional and feasible export effort
and provided recourse to commercial sources is kept within reasonable limits,
debt service would remain a manageable burden on the balance of payments.

PART II - BA4K GROUP OPERATIONS IN MOROCCO
20.       Bank and IDA lending to Morocco has supported 26 projects with
financing totalling $595.5 million (net of cancellations), of which $380.5
million has been lent since the beginning of FY73. IDA credits, totalling
$50.0 million, have been made available for five projects. A Third Window
loan for $25 million was approved in March 1976. IFC investments have amount-
ed to $4.4 million. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA
credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1976, and notes on the execution
of ongoing IBRD/ID)A projects. In some cases, delays have been caused by man-
agement or procurement difficulties, and in 1974 cost overruns have increased
due to the upsurge in investment activity in Morocco and the acceleration of
inflation. However, performance in project execution has considerably improved
during the last two years.
21.       Past Bank Group lending has been concentrated in the industrial and
agricultural sectors, which together have accounted for 70 percent of total
net commitments; the balance is accounted for by utilities (14 percent), roads
(8 percent), tourism (5 percent) and education (3 percent). Apart from the
transfer of resources to Morocco (Bank Group gross disbursements amounted to
5.5 percent of total fixed investment in 1970-74), the main objectives of
lending were to foster and strengthen development institutions, provide tech-
nical assistance, particularly for project preparation, and increase produc-
tive capacity, particularly in order to improve the balance of payments.
2'.       While these objectives remain, emphasis is now also being given to
supporting the new orientation of the Government's development effort in the
field of income distribution. Future Bank lending will reflect this orienta-
tion. An increasing share of Bank Group lending will be devoted to projects
developinig directly or indirectly the productive capacity of the lowest
urban and rural income groups.
23.       Past lending for agriculture has supported irrigation development
and credit. The Doukkala Irrigation Project has been recently approved by the
Executive Directors. While continued lending for irrigation is envisaged,
greater emphasis will be given to supporting the improvement of rainfed farm-
ing, and lending will in general be focussed on support to small farmers. A
first project for the development of rainfed agriculture in the Meknes region
w.1s approved in FY1975. Projects for livestock/rural development in the
rainfed zone in northern Morocco, for agricultural credit and for developing
production of fruits and vegetables are being prepared.
24.       Continued lending for industry and tourism through two DFC's (Banque
Nationale pour le Developpement Economique and Credit Immobilier et Hotelier)
will be proposed. The Bay of Agadir Tourism project has been recently ap-
proved by the Executive Directors. A project for the construction of a large
cement plant in the less developed northeast part of the country is envisaged.
Projects in industry and tourism have as key objectives increased foreign
exchange earnings or savings and the improvement of sectoral policies.



- 7 -
25.       A sites and services project in Casablanca is being prepared.      It
should contribute to solving the problem of rapid growth of slum areas. A
substantial social services component is envisaged.     The Bank is executing
agency for project preparation being financed by UNDP; UNDP is also providing
technical assistance for overall planning of the sector. A second Water Sup-
ply project is being prepared to meet the needs of several urban and rural
sectors. A multipurose development project on the Oum-er-R'bia river, mainly
for power but also with substantial irrigation and industrial and potable
water supply benefits, is being appraised.
26.       Education is a critical bottleneck in Morocco's development.     Two
IDA credits have been made to develop secondary education and teacher training
and to improve technical and vocational training. The third project has been
recently approved by the Executive Directors.
27.       A consultative group for Morocco was formed in April 1967 under the
chairmanship of the Bank. It includes Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, Kuwait, Spain, the U.K., the U.S., UNDP, OECD/DAC, the African Develop-
ment Bank and the European Investment Bank. The last meeting of the Group,
on March 28 and 29, 1974, expressed satisfaction with the improvement in
Morocco's economic performance in recent years, and the emphasis in the Third
Five-Year Plan (1973-77) on improving the distribution of growth benefits.
The gross inflow of official loans and grants to Morocco rose from $129 mil-
lion in 1966 to $159 million (of which $18 million in grants) in 1971, but
temporarily fell to $128 million in 1972 and $121 million in 1973; in 1974
the gross inflow rose again to $190 million. The major sources of aid were
France, the U.S., Germany and the Bank Group.
28.       At the end of 1975, the Bank Group's share in Morocco's external
public debt was estimated at 17 percent on a disbursement basis. The share
of the Bank Group in debt service was 12 percent in 1974 and an estimated
14 percent in 1975. By 1980 the Bank Group's shares in debt outstanding
and in debt service are expected to rise to about 24 percent and 15 percent
respectively.
PART III - THE TOURISM SECTOR
29.       Located within easy reach by car, boat and airplane from European
tourist generating countries, Morocco offers attractive beaches along its
extensive Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts, architectural monuments of its
four imperial cities of Marrakesh, Fez, Meknes and Rabat and the unique
ambiance of its pre-Saharan oases. The diversity of its tourism resources
and climatic conditions attracts a heterogenous tourist clientele, including
culturally motivated tourists as well as year-round beach vacationers; as a
result, tourist traffic to Morocco is more evenly distributed over the year
than in many other Mediterranean countries, despite high seasonal fluctua-
tions in the North of the country.



- 8 -
30.       The number of foreign visitors increased from 469,000 to 1,226,000
between 1968 and 1973, at an annual rate of 21 percent. A 14 percent decline
in 1974 reflected the impact of the energy crisis and economic recession in
Europe. Growth has resumed in 1975; in the first quarter of that year foreign
visitor arrivals were 25 percent greater than in the corresponding quarter of
1974. In 1974, about 60 percent of tourists came from Western Europe and 20
percent from North America. About two-thirds of total visitors arrived in
Morocco by surface transport. According to a study of Mediterranean tourism
markets, recently completed for ten DFC's in Mediterranean countries, foreign
tourist arrivals are projected to grow over the next decade at 10.5 percent
per year for Morocco, as compared with 5 percent for the Mediterranean region
as a whole.
31.       The country's hotel capacity has doubled between 1968 and 1974 to
reach 41,000 beds. About two-thirds of the hotels built during that period
were sponsored by private investors, most of them Moroccan. The remainder
was sponsored by the Government or by public agencies such as the Moroccan
Railways, Royal Air Maroc and Government-controlled banks. During the Second
Five-Year Development Plan (1968-72) hotel investment amounted to about US$120
million and represented slightly less than 4 percent of the total gross fixed
capital formation. Morocco's hotel accommodations are generally of a high
standard, with luxury establishments accounting for over 40 percent of the
total. They are concentrated in the four imperial cities and Casablanca (43
percent), the Mediterranean coast (35 percent) and Agadir (12 percent). This
regional distribution reflects past demand; however, current demand trends
favor the southern region rather than the Mediterranean coast. About 30 per-
cent of existing accommodation is managed by foreigners. The 1973-77
Development Plan called for the construction of 55,000 beds over five years.
Implementation during the first two years of the Plan lagged far behind Plan
objectives and achievements during the previous Plan period. However, the
shortfall is essentially the result of unrealistic projections on which the
objectives were based. The sluggish growth was also due to the general
slowdown in investment following the political events in 1971 and 1972, more
promising investment opportunities for Moroccan investors in other sectors
following the Moroccanization laws, and the shortage of serviced land in
Agadir and Marrakesh, Morocco's fastest growing tourist areas.
32.       Gross foreign exchange receipts from tourism represented about 11
percent of the country's total foreign exchange earnings from the export of
goods and non-factor services in 1974. Until phosphate prices were raised
in 1973, tourism was Morocco's major foreign exchange earner. About 16,000
Moroccans are directly employed in the hotel industry. In addition, some
60,000 jobs in handicrafts and some 20,000 in agriculture, construction in-
dustry, transport and other services are generated by tourism demand.
33.       The Tourism Directorate of the Ministry of Urban Development, Hous-
ing, Tourism and Environment (MUHTE) is responsible for promoting tourism,
administering the investment incentLve system, training hotel personnel and



- 9 -
developing tourism infrastructure. The Government is aware that inadequate
planning in the past has led to an over-concentration of investment in the
Mediterranean tourism resorts. To prevent a recurrence of this situation,
the Tourism Directorate has undertaken to prepare regional master plans for
tourism development and is hiring consultants for this purpose. The Govern-
ment has confirmed its intention to keep the Bank informed of progress in the
preparation of these plans. This will be recorded in a supplemental letter to
the Guarantee Agreement.
34.       Hotel construction is financed through the Credit Immobilier et
Hotelier (CIH), a government controlled development finance company specializ-
ing in housing and hotel lending. CIH was founded in 1920 as a mortgage bank
for the long term financing of housing construction; it became a hotel finan-
cier in 1960. CIH financed about one half of the total amount invested in
hotels during the 1968-1972 National Development Plan period and the first
two years of the 1973-1977 Plan. CIH has also been instrumental in promoting
activities within the housing and tourism sectors, through the creation of
specialized subsidiaries for construction and management of hotels and pre-
fabrication of housing elements. CIH's goal of gradually withdrawing from
subsidiaries, once the interest of other investors, and particularly foreign
investors, has been aroused, has proven successful.
35.        Incentives for hotel investors are provided by the 1973 Investment
Code as follows: (i) a ten-year full or partial income tax exemption; (ii)
an interest free Government advance equivalent to 15 percent of the estimated
investment cost, excluding land acquisition, for ten years including five
years of grace; (iii) various tax reductions, including reduced rates on real
estate taxes in the early years of operation, reduced capital registration
tax, and waiver of sales tax on investment inputs (but not replacements);
and (iv) an interest rebate on hotel loans provided by CIH, reducing CIH's
interest rate to 4.5 percent p.a. Under a proposed amendment to the 1973 law
expected to be promulgated shortly,this subsidized interest rate would increase
to 6 percent; CIH already has fixed its nominal rate at 11 percent to apply to
all loans approved after July 1, 1976. The amendment would also allow future
adjustments of the subsidized interest rate by ministerial decree rather than
by law.
36.       The Bank has expressed concern on several occasions that generous
incentives may lead to overinvestment in hotels and misallocation of resources.
Incentives are granted to investors in hotel projects which have been approved
technically by IIUHTE and financially by CIH. CIH calculates an economic rate
of return on all hotel investments; however, because of methodology and
limited data, these calculations are not reliable. The appraisal mission
conducted a survey aimed at establishing the methodological and information
bases for improved economic appraisal techniques. A computer model was
constructed to simulate financial and economic returns on hotel investments
under different assumptions including changes in the incentives system.
Definitive conclusions could not be arrived at in view of the deficiencies



- 10 -
in statistical information and the difficulties met in establishing a repre-
sentative sample of hotels. However, the survey findings suggest that many
hotels in the southern region and in Casablanca would be financially profit-
able without incentives. On the other hand, even with incentives, financial
prospects of northern beach hotels would not be attractive, unless occupancy
rates or tariffs were increased. IWhile the soundness of the incentive system
is in question, a basis for firm recommendations on how it should be changed
is still lacking. The Government has confirmed its intention (i) to establish
a satisfactory system of collection and analysis of tourism statistics; (ii)
to pursue and refine with CIH's assistance the survey conducted by the Bank so
as to permit a more conclusive assessment of financial and economic viability
of hotel investments in Morocco; and, (iii) upon completion of this assess
ment in about two years and taking into account the findings of these analyses
to revise as necessary its investment code and adjust fiscal and tariff
policies for hotel investment in Morocco (draft supplemental letter to the
Guarantee Agreement). In the meantime, CIG has confirmed its intention to
adopt stricter financial and economic appraisal criteria to ensure that it
would only finance economically sound projects (draft supplemental letter to
the Loan Agreement). CIH would in particular apply to each project a test of
the magnitude of additional capacity required against existing capacity
effectively used. This test, the minimum economic occupancy rate (MEOR),
represents for each type of hotel in each region a threshold beyond which
additional capacity may be desirable, the existing capacity being saturated
during the peak month.
37.       The Bank started financing tourism projects in Morocco in 1966, when
it agreed that part of a loan to Banque Nationale de Developpement Economique
(Loan No. 447 DIOR) could be relent to CIH for hotel financing. It has since
extended two lines of credit to CIH to finance hotel construction, the first
in 1970 for US$10 million and the second in 1972 for US$15 million. The Bank
has recently approved the Bay of Agadir Tourism Project which will provide
infrastructure for new tourism development in Agadir, the fast growing year
round beach resort in southern Morocco. The Bank has also recently approved
a Third Education Project which will include construction of a hotel training
school to supplement five existing schools and graduate each year about 55
middle level hotel technicians; and of four hotel training centers to train
about 520 lower level hotel personnel each year.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
38.       The proposed loan would constitute the third Bank loan to CIII.     The
first Bank loan of $10 million, signed on August 2, 1970, is fully committed
and disbursed. The second Bank loan of $15 million, signed on June 30, 1972,
is expected to be fully committed shortly. Disbursements under these two
loans have been slow because of the unfavorable investment climate in the
early 1970's and the difficulties encountered by CIH in obtaining adequate
documentation for withdrawal applications. With the improvement of the in-
vestment climate and as hotel investors are becoming more experienced, dis-
bursements are expected to be faster than in the past. The proposed third



- 11 -
CIH project was appraised in October 1975. Negotiations for the proposed
loan were held in Washington in April, 1976. CIH was represented by its
President Director General, Mr. El Fihri, and the Guarantor by Mr. Tazi,
Director of the Treasury. An appraisal report on CIH (No. 1077-MOR) dated
April 30, 1976, is being distributed separately. A Loan and Project Summary
is attached as Annex III.
Organization and Procedures
39.       Though formally a private company subject to corporate law, CIH is
effectively controlled by the Government through Caisse des Depots et de
Gestion, a public sector financial institution which holds 17 percent of CIH's
capital. CIH's share capital was increased from DH 20 million to DH 40 mil-
lion in 1973 and again to DH 60 million in 1974.
40.       The public nature of CIH is reflected in the composition of its
Board of Directors and Executive Committee. Of CIH's 15 Board members, only
two represent private shareholders; seven are representatives of public sector
shareholders and five of the Ministries of Finance and of Urban Development
and Tourism. The latter Ministry is also represented in the Executive Commit-
tee which is composed of five members in addition to the chairman. Until
December 1972, when Mr. El Fihri was appointed as President Director General,
CIII suffered from lack of continuity in leadership. Since then, the Board
has become more involved in monitoring and guiding CIH's policies and activi-
ties. The Executive Committee examines and approves all tourism loan pro-
posals and all other loans amounting to more than Dil 100,000 ($25,000). Lend-
ing decisions on smaller loans are delegated to CIH's President Director Gen-
eral.
41.       CIH, which is comprised of three departments one each for credit, fi-
nance and administration, was reorganized in 1974 following the recommendation
of a management consulting firm. The main innovations have been the regroup-
ing of operational divisions in the credit department by functions rather than
by sector of activity and the establishment of regional branch offices, which
have the authority to approve housing loans up to DH 60,000. CIH's staff is
qualified and now numbers 216 including 58 professionals.
42.       The appraisal of hotel projects has steadily improved over the years.
In most cases, the technical, legal, financial and managerial aspects of proj-
ects are adequately covered by CIH's reports. The technical appraisal of
larger projects is reviewed by independent engineering firms. The weak part
of CIH's hotel appraisals is the analysis of marketing prospects as a result
of inadequate statistical background information. The measures to be imple-
mented by the Government and CIH, as mentioned in paragraph 36, are intended
to help remedy this situation.
43.        Supervision of hotel projects under construction is generally satis-
factory. CIlI's technical staff has acquired considerable experience in scru-
tinizing cost estimates and invoices. CIH's disbursement procedures are ade-
quate. The proceeds of CIH's construction loans for hotels are made available



- 12 -
to borrowers in four main tranches, plus a 10 percent final tranche, which is
withheld until the completion of work. Funds are disbursed only following
inspections by CIH's staff. Disbursements are suspended when a discrepancy is
found between the original plans and the implementation of the project. CIH
has confirmed its intention to prepare and submit to the Bank follow-up reports
on all projects when disbursements deviate significantly from the original
schedule.
44.       Supervision of hotel operations - a key issue for the last Bank
loan - has greatly improved since 1972. A portfolio supervision division has
been set up and is by and large operating satisfactorily. CIH has confirmed
its intention to organize and staff this division so as to visit at least
twice a year hotels in arrears and to send to the Bank a copy of its semi-
annual supervision reports of such hotels. This will be recorded in a supple-
mental letter to the Loan Agreement.
Operations
45.        Between January 1, 1972 and September 30, 1975, CIH approved hous-
ing loans totalling DH 394 million, most of them in the medium price range,
and hotel loans totalling DH 145 million. The southern region including
Marrakesh increased its share of CIH hotel financing from 27 percent of ap-
provals in 1973 to 95 percent in 1974. This change reflects CIH's response
to growing demand in this region and a shift from the earlier emphasis on
Mediterranean coast investments. CIH's equity investments grew rapidly from
only DR 1.3 million in 12 financial institutions in 1972 to DR 29 million in
37 companies at end 1975. This is mainly the result of CIH's successful pro-
motional activities.
46.       Hotel loans are limited to 20 years for construction with up to
five years of grace and to 10 years for equipment with no grace period. CIH
finances from 50 percent to 60 percent of the investment cost of a typical
hotel. The Government usually guarantees at least 50 percent of the outstand-
ing loan amount.
Financial Results and Portfolio
47.        CIH's balance sheets and income statements reflect a doubling of
total assets from DH 392 million at end 1971 to DH 884 million as of December
31, 1975. This doubling is accounted for mainly by an increase of DH 407
million in outstanding loans and investments. The housing loan portfolio
increased its share in CIH's portfolio from 29 percent to 38 percent. Access
to the bond market of all financial institutions is closely controlled by the
Government, which sets a yearly ceiling to new issues. However, CIH has so
far received full support from the authorities in mobilizing adequate resources
in the market. Up to 1975, the total increase in CIH's long term resources
was obtained directly or indirectly from Caisse des Depots et de Gestion, the
Central Bank and Banque Centrale Populaire. In 1975, CIH placed directly a DH
110 million 15-year bond issue at 7.5 percent.    CIH's medium-term resources,
which represented at end 1975 about 17 percent of its outstanding borrowings,



- 13 -
were obtained through the issuance of notes subscribed by commercial banks.
Two increases in share capital in 1973 and 1974 financed DH 40 million of the
increase in assets (about 8 percent). During the period 1972-1974 CIH's
debt/equity ratio, as defined in the 1972 Loan Agreement with the Bank, has
remained within the agreed limit of 6:1. During 1975, additional borrowings
brought the ratio to 6.9:1. In December 1975, the Government granted to CIH
a Dil 40 million loan for 20 years, including a 10-year grace period; if consi-
dered as part of CIH's equity base according to the definition set forth in
the 1972 Loan Agreement with the Bank, this loan would lower the ratio to 5.3:1.
48.        During the period 1971-1974, while CIH achieved generally good ope-
rating results, profits were not in line with the growth of operations because
of higher cost of resources by comparison with the average yield of its loans;
net income to average equity decreased from 19.9 percent to 9.4 percent. CIHl's
current ratio increased from 1.1:1 at end 1973 to 1.8:1 at end 1975; yet be-
cause of high arrears and the imbalance between borrowing and lending terms its
liquidity over the past three years remained a problem. Most of CIH borrowings
are in effect repayable without a grace period on a level principal basis,
whereas the loans it makes are amortized on a level total payment basis with
up to five years of grace for hotel loans.
49.       Arrears on CIH's loans increased in 1974 and 1975.     As of September
30, 1975, amounts of principal and interest overdue for more than five months
represented about 4.9 percent of CIH's total portfolio, as compared with 3.6
percent as of December 31, 1971 and 3.0 percent as of December 31, 1973.
Arrears on housing loans are generally less than a year old and stem prin-
cipally from the heavy strain put on middle to low income borrowers by semi-
annual installments. Over the past fifty years, CIH has experienced no loss
on housing loans, which are more than adequately secured. Arrears on hotel
loans partly result from weak collection procedures, delays in hotel construc-
tion and, for some hotels which are sensitive to seasonal variations, inade-
quate timing of semi-annual installments falling at periods of low cash
receipts. CIH's risks on borrowers accounting for 70 percent of all hotel
loan arrears can be considered moderate after analysis. However, eleven
borrowers, accounting for 30 percent of hotel loan arrears (DH 5.3 million)
face more serious difficulties stemming from inadequate market analysis and
poor management. CIII is considering imposing new management contracts on some
borrowers and rescheduling debts when justified. Since all hotel loans are
covered by a first mortgage and a Government guarantee of at least 50 percent
of the outstanding loan amount, CIH's provisions of DH 7.4 million against
possible losses as of December 31, 1975 adequately cover its risk.
50.       As a result of a series of measures already enforced by CIH, its
arrears situation has considerably improved since September 30, 1975. Routine
collection on overdue housing loans is now the responsibility of CIll's account-
ing division which systematically resorts to outside lawyers whenever the
first two reminders to the borrower have had no effect. Two recent rounds of
follow-up visits to CIH's hotel clients in default, especially in the Tangiers



- 14 -
and Agadir areas, have been successful. Threat of prompt recourse to legal
actions, and the enforcement of penalty interest on overdues (at a rate 2 per-
cent higher than CIH's unsubsidized rate) has resulted in the settlement of
numerous contented cases. As a consequence, amounts of principal and interest
overdue for more than five months, which represented about 4.9 percent of
CIH's total portfolio on September 30, 1975, decreased to about 3.4 percent
by March 31, 1976.
51.       While it remains financially creditworthy, CIH should further re-
duce existing arrears and their possible recurrence in the future. CIH has
confirmed its intention to maintain and reinforce the measures already taken
in order to reduce by at least 50 percent before December 31, 1977, as compared
with September 30, 1975, the ratio of outstanding loans affected by arrears to
the total portfolio and to send to the Bank quarterly progress reports on the
arrears situation. CIH will apply monthly amortization schedules to its
housing loans, in the first instance to those extended to civil servants, and
explore and gradually apply quarterly amortization schedules for its tourism
loans, provided such changes do not adversely affect the financial equilibrium
of CIH's borrowers. Finally CIH's exposure to any single company would con-
tinue to be limited to a maximum of 20 percent of CIH's equity (Section 3.06
of the draft Loan Agreement).
Operational and Financial Projections
52.        CIH expects its housing and other non-tourism loan approvals to
increase from DH 176 million in 1975 to DH 382 million in 1979. In view of
the past trend in housing approvals, which almost tripled between 1973 and
1975, and of the demand backlog, CIR's expectations appear reasonable.
53.       CIH's pipeline of tourism projects expected to be approved in the
1976-1979 period now includes 45 new hotels and 6 hotel extensions. These
projects would add a total of 16,583 beds to Morocco's current accommodation
capacity. On the whole, this pipeline appears sound as 40 hotels would be
built or expanded in Morocco's growing tourism demand areas such as the
southern region and Casablanca and in heretofore neglected areas with good
potential for growth, such as the presaharan and eastern regions. Moreover,
the 26 medium category hotels included in the pipeline should fill the short-
fall in the existing supply of such accommodations. Most of the promoters
are experienced hotel companies.
54.       To meet commitments of Dll 981 miLLion expected between January 1,
1976 - December 31, 1978, CIH would have to raise new resources of DH 858 mil-
lion, after deducting uncommitted funds and self-generated resources. CIH's
foreign exchange requirements for hotel financing through December 1978 are
projected to amount to DH 126 million ($30.4 million). The proposed Bank loan
of $25 million would cover CIII's requirements for commitments through mid-1978.
It is hoped that by that time CIH would have succeeded in its ongoing efforts
to diversify its foreign borrowings.



- 15 -
55.        Under the last Loan Agreement with the Bank (Loan No. 848-MOR) CIH's
borrowing capacity would be limited by the debt/equity ratio of 6:1 (para 47),
whereas CIH is not in a position to increase its share capital until profit-
ability can be improved. Considering the growing proportion in CIH's port-
-folio of housing loans whose risk has traditionally been considerably smaller
than that of hotel loans, a relaxation of the overall debt/equity ratio can
be justified. For the proposed loan, CII would be requested to maintain a
debt/equity ratio of 7.5:1, while the Government subordinated loan of DH 40
million extended in December 1975 would be considered as part of CIH's equity
base; however an amount of DH 4 million from that loan would be deducted each
year from Clii's equity base (Section 4.06 of the draft Loan Agreement). This
would induce CIH to carry out its proposed capital increase by 1977 and 1978.
56.        CIH's profitability is expected to remain low through 1976 due to
higher operating costs and narrowing interest spread between the average
yield of its loans and the average cost of its financial resources. However,
starting in 1977, profitability is expected to improve substantially, as the
effects of interest rate increases from 8.75 percent to 10 percent on new
housing loans since November 1975 and from 8.75 percent to 11 percent on new
hotel loans after July 1976, will be felt. This improvement would allow CIH
to remunerate adequately the two projected share capital increases of DII 20
million each in 1977 and 1978. However, because of the projected declining
trend of CIH's interest spread from 3.2 in 1975 to 2.7 in 1979, additions to
reserves would not be commensurate with CIH's increased level of operations.
The Government has agreed to ensure CIH a sufficient profitability and ade-
quate liquidity by allowing in particular CIH to adjust terms of its loans and
borrowings. The Government would continue to bear the foreign exchange risk
(Section 3.03 of the draft Guarantee Agreement).
57.       CIH's assets are forecast to almost double from about DH 884 million
at end 1975 to DH 1,643 million at end 1978. Housing and other non-tourism
loans would triple during this period thus increasing their relative import-
ance from 46 percent to 64 percent of total loan portfolio outstanding. Hotel
loans outstanding are projected to increase by only 33 percent during the same
period.
Terms of the Proposed Loan
58.       The proposed loan to CIH would be made on the terms and conditions
usual for loans to development finance companies, including the standard
commitment charge. Amortization would conform substantially to the aggregate
of the amortization schedules applicable to the specific investment projects
to be financed out of the proceeds of the loan and would not extend beyond 20
years. In view of the improvement in CIH's appraisal capability and greater
experience of its hotel borrowers as well as the inflation in costs of hotel
projects since May 1972, the free limit above which Bank approval of a project
is required would be raised from $200,000 to $800,000 (Section 2.02c of the
draft Loan Agreement). This limit would be applied to both construction and
equipment subloans for a single hotel project. The Bank would thereby review



- 16 -
more than 50 percent of projects being financed out of the loan; the foreign
exchange cost of these projects would represent over 75 percent of the pro-
posed loan. The proposed loan would finance 100 percent of the cost financed
by CIH of imported equipment; 65 percent of the cost of imported equipment or
equipment assembled or processed locally from imported components purchased in
Morocco (equalling its estimated foreign exchange cost) and the foreign ex-
change component of construction costs.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
59.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Credit Immobilier
et Hotelier, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Kingdom of Morocco and
the Bank, the draft supplemental letters referred to in paragraphs 33, 36 and
44 above, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III Section
4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans for development
finance companies.
60.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
61.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION I/
Ln. No. 643 Rharb-Sebou Irrigation Project: US$46 million Loan of November
13, 1969; Date of Effectiveness: June 8, 1970; Closing Date:
November 30, 1978.
Progress in implementing the project is now satisfactory although
considerable problems were first experienced with management and procurement,
and some procurement difficulties continue. The major project structure,
Idriss ler Dam, is completed and equipment of 13,200 ha out of a total of
35,000 ha is completed. Another 3,850 ha are expected to be commissioned soon.
Project execution was delayed in 1975 due to a shortage, now rectified, of
concrete canalettes. Additional infrastructure for the project area, includ-
ing a sugar cane processing factory and flood protection works, are being
provided by Loan No. 1018-MOR.
Cr. No. 266 Second Education Project: US$8.5 million Credit of August 18,
1971; Date of Effectiveness: December 10, 1971;
Closing Date: April 30, 1976.
The project included the expansion and improvement of specific sec-
tions of the secondary, vocational and higher educational systems of the Bor-
rower, and technical assistance for project administration and school mainte-
nance. Subsequently the Association agreed not to finance two Vocational
Training Centers and the Department of Veterinary Medicine. Accordingly, an
amount of about US$0.9 million has been transferred to the unallocated cate-
gory for future reallocation and/or cancellation. Initial delays occurred
in the appointment of consultant architects, in the recruitment of local per-
sonnel and technical assistance experts for the Project Unit and in procure-
ment. However, execution is now proceeding satisfactorily, and all civil
works contracts under the project have been awarded. Physical execution of
the project is forecast for completion by the end of 1976, about one year and
a half later than originally planned, and an extension of the closing date
will be necessary.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 848 Second Hotel Development Project; US$15 million of June 30, 1972;
Date of Effectiveness: November 1, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Commitments and disbursements initially lagged behind expectations,
due to sluggish investment activity in 1973, but the loan is now expected to
be fully committed by June 1976, as against the appraisal estimate of March
1974.
Ln. No. 850 Water Supply Project; US$48 million Loan of July 19, 1972;
Date of E.ffectiveness: May 2, 1973; Closing Date: December 31,
1977.
The dam which was the major component of the project was inaugurated
in August 1974. All project elements are being completed on schedule except
for the treatment plant and the training school, which are both about six
months behind schedule. The financial position of the Borrower, Office Na-
tional de l'Eau Potable (ONEP), is satisfactory. In early 1976 consultants
have completed a tariff study which will assist in improving ONEP's long-
term financial performance.   Consultants have recently been engaged to under-
take a management study for ONEP.
Ln. No. 861, Cr. No. 338 Second Agricultural Credit Project; US$34.0 million
of October 10, 1972; Date of Effectiveness:
February 2, 1973; Closing Date: August 31, 1976.
The project has been progressing satisfactorily and disbursements
had reached US$28.0 million by the end of tHarch 1976. The Caisse Nationale
de Credit Agricole (CNCA) increased its lending rates in September 1975; as a
result, the total of sub-loans which qualify for reimbursement under the Bank
loan has increased. The loan is now fully committed and disbursements are
likely to be completed by May 1976.
Ln. No. 890 Sixth BNDE Project; US$24 million of May 14, 1973; Date of
Effectiveness: September 10, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The loan was fully committed by May 1974, about six months earlier
than expected, due to rapid improvement of the investment climate since mid-
1973. Disbursements are also running slightly ahead of the appraisal estimate
and should be completed by June 1976.
Ln. No. 936 Power Project; US$25 million of October 5, 1973; Date of Effective-
ness: January 23, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Physical implementation of the project is practically complete. Sav-
ings amounting to about US$3.5 million are being applied with the Bank's agree-
ment to consultant services for feasibility studies, preliminary design and
preparation of bid documents for 5 hydro stations required to alleviate
Morocco's dependency on imported oil. Although electricity rates were sharply

increased on January 1, 1976, ONE's rate of return has not yet reached the
covenanted level because of even sharper increases in the cost of imported
inputs.
Ln. No. 955 Second Highway Project; US$29 million of January 11, 1974; Date
of Effectiveness: May 21, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
Construction of the Rabat-Casablanca expressway began in early 1975,
8 months behind schedule; two contracts were awarded for the equivalent of
about $21 million, 30 percent above the appraisal estimate as a result of
world inflation. Purchase of maintenance equipment and work on the highway
improvement program are proceeding satisfactorily, close to the appraisal cost
estimates. The urban traffic and transport study in the towns of Casablanca
and Rabat is nearing completion. The Government has recently awarded a con-
tract for technical assistance for the establishment of a Transport Planning
Office in the Ministry of Public Works.
Ln. No. 1017 Phosphoric Acid Project; US$50.0 million of June 27, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: February 27, 1975; Closing Date:
June 39, 1977.
Progress in project execution is good, although there is likely to
be a delay in completion of one to three months, due to a delay in the civil
works component of the turnkey contract. Commercial operations of the first
production unit are presently scheduled to start in June 1976, and construc-
tion of all units should be completed by October 1976.
Ln. No. 1018 Sebou II Development Project; US$32.0 millio of June 27, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: February 28, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979.
The sugar cane processing factory was commissioned in June, 1975,
one month later than originally scheduled, but in time to process the 1975
harvest. Construction of the project area roads is on schedule but work on
the flood protection dykes is about nine months behind schedule. The studies
of pollution control and the incidence of bilharzia on the Rharb plain have
not yet been started.
Ln. No. 1061 Seventh BNDE Project; US$30 million of December 30, 1974; Date
of Effectiveness: January 15, 1975; Closing Date: December 31,
1978.
This loan is expected to be fully committed shortly. Disbursements
are roughly in line with appraisal estimates.
Ln. No. 1123 Souss Groundwater Project; US$18.5 million of June 11, 1975;
Date of Effectiveness: September 26, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1980.
Project execution is on schedule. The project unit has been created,
its staff appointed, and the project co-ordinating committee has been estab-
lished.

June 11, 1975; Date of Effectiveness: November 14, 1975;
Closing Date: March 31, 1981.
Project execution is somewhat behind schedule due to staff con-
straints and organizational problems which are presently being reviewed with
the Government. Bidding for topographical and soil surveys is expected to
begin shortly.
Ln. No. 1201 Doukkala Irrigation Project; US$30.0 million of February 27,
