REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE SYRIAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS ESTABLISHMENT
FOR A TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Loan to the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment (STE) for the equivalent
of US$28 million with the guarantee of the Syrian Arab Republic to help fi-
nance a telecommunicat:ions project. The loan would have a term of 20 years,
including a four-year grace period, with interest at 8.5 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects for
Syria" (No. 806-SYR, October 31, 1975) was distributed to the Executive Di-
rectors on November 12, 1975. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        Since attaining independence in 1946, Syria has had several changes
in regime which resulted in a shift of power from groups of landowners, traders,
and industrialists to a rising class of officers, technicians, and civil
servants, as well as a shift of the economy from an essential laissez-faire
system to a largely publicly-owned and regulated one. The Baath Socialist
Party, the ruling party since 1963, provided substantial continuity of emphasis
on economic and social development policies which have, by and large, prevailed
in spite of internal Government changes and tensions within the Middle East.
During the 1960s an agrarian reform was completed, with redistribution of land
to large number of formerly landless peasants. In November 1970 General Assad
became President of the Republic, and his regime has since been characterized
by a balance of firmness and conciliation in domestic policies, economic
pragmatism, a concerted search for a better defined role for the private
sector in a centrally regulated economy, as well as diversification of foreign
economic relations. These aims have been pursued gradually and, in spite of
continued political uncertaintity in the Middle East, substantial reorienta-
tion of economic policies and diversification of production have been achieved.
4.        Developments in the second half of the 1960s had far-reaching effects
on economic performance as private initiative and investment declined while
public sector investment gained momentum only slowly. However, economic per-
formance since 1970 has improved significantly, partly as a result of favor-
able weather conditions which led to a substantial increase in agricultural
production, and partly because the newly-introduced economic policy measures
which aimed at stimulating the private sector began to take effect. The ris-
ing trend in output, however, was interrupted by the severe drought in 1973
and the aftermath of the October war. Nevertheless, by 1974 the Syrian econ-
omy had almost completely recovered both from the dislocation caused by the

war and from the relative stagnation of the agricultural sector brought about
by the drought. As a result, GDP in 1974 increased by almost 13 percent in
real terms compared to just over 2 percent in the previous year. Overall,
real per capita income increased by over 5 percent per year between 1970 and
1974. Economic growth in 1975 is believed to have been close to that achieved
in 1974, and prospects for continued growth in 1976 are good.
5.        Because of the size and importance of the agricultural sector, the
Syrian economy remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in agricultural out-
put brought about by variations in the amount and timing of rainfall. How-
ever, the share of industry in GDP has grown substantially in recent years
and industry is emerging as a leading sector in the economy. National ac-
counts estimates for 1974 indicate that both agriculture and industry ac-
counted for about 22 percent of GDP in constant 1963 prices, but because of
the relative increases in industrial prices, value added in industry at cur-
rent prices amounted to 30 percent of GDP while that for agriculture reached
22 percent. With the expected growth in extractive industries, the share of
the industrial sector relative to that of agriculture is expected to rise
further in the near future.
6.        Total investment continues to increase both in absolute and relative
terms. Gross fixed investment increased from about LS 1.2 billion (about 16.7
percent of GDP) in 1971 to about LS 3.0 billion in 1974 (about 20.5 percent
of GDP), with the public sector accounting for about two-thirds of the total.
Though its share in total investment has remained about constant, private
investment in absolute terms increased threefold between 1970 and 1974. By
far the larger part of investment was in industry and construction. At the
same time, domestic savings continued to grow and on average financed some 70
percent of total investment with net imports accounting for the remaining
30 percent. However, with the growth of current transfers from abroad, na-
tional savings, which averaged about 29 percent of GNP over the past two years,
have substantially exceeded current domestic investment in recent years.
7.        Recently, there have been significant changes in absolute and rela-
tive prices. The GDP deflator indicates a 37 percent increase in prices in
1974 compared to under 6 percent average growth per year during 1970-1973.
Indices of wholesale and retail prices, though less reliable, confirm the
rapidly emerging inflationary pressures in the economy as increased ag-
gregate demand continues to generate pressures on domestic resources. In
spite of an improved external balance situation import liberalization poli-
cies have so far not been used effectively to increase the total supply
of resources. Growing inflationary pressures may pose serious problems for
the Syrian economy in future and, if unchecked, may reflect adversely on
future growth prospects of the economy. A favorable balance of payments
position and a relatively high level of foreign exchange reserves would
warrant a further liberalization of import regulations to increase the supply
of goods and services in an attempt to dampen inflationary pressure in the
economy.



8.        Continued overall deficits have been the main characteristic of
the Syrian Government budget in recent years. Domestic revenues have been
slightly higher than current expenditures, so that a large part of development
expenditures has been financed through external project loans or through bor-
rowing from the bankingy system.  Since 1973, however, the situation has sub-
stantially changed as grants and aid from other Arab countries increased
to such a level that Government recourse to the banking system to finance
the overall deficits was unnecessary.    With an even higher level of public
expenditures, the overall budgetary deficit in 1974 was twice as large as
that for the previous year, yet it was more than covered by an even larger
amount of Arab grants and other aid.
9.        The substantial increase in domestic revenues in 1973 and 1974,
mainly as a result of the rapid growth of oil revenues, is expected to con-
tinue in 1975. To the extent that the past increase in income was not a
result of higher taxes, their use in financing an even higher level of public
expenditure on domestic goods and services results in a net injection of extra
liquidity in the economy which might lead to an intensification of the infla-
tionary impact of the budget. This is even more so since the share of tax and
other non-oil revenues in total revenues has been declining.
10.       Government development expenditures are carried out in accordance
with the Third Five-Year Plan (1971-75). During the first three years of the
Plan, there were considerable shortfalls in total planned expenditures, mainly
due to weaknesses in project preparation and follow up procedures, as well as
severe shortages of foreign exchange. More recently, however, a heightened
concern with developmEnt issues, new procedures and reporting systems, as well
as a considerable easing of the foreign exchange situation, have led to a
considerably higher public sector investment, particularly for 1974, with an
even stronger performance anticipated for 1975. However, these improvements
might have come too late to substantially increase the implementation rates
of the current Plan, which at the end of 1975 probably did not exceed 55-60
percent.
11.       Syria's balance of payments, which had been in substantial deficit
since 1968, improved in 1971 when the deficit was reduced sharply, registered
a small surplus in 1972, very substantial surpluses in 1973 and 1974, and is
expected to have been in surplus again in 1975. The improvement initially
reflected increased o:il transit dues, current transfers from abroad, and
private capital inflow. In the last two years, large transfers from Arab
countries have offset the widening trade deficit and resulted in overall pay-
ment surpluses of LS [.2 billion in 1973 and an estimated LS 641 million in
1974. As a result, gross foreign international reserves increased from the
equivalent of US$135 million at the end of 1972 to US$481 million at the end
of 1973, $528 million at the end of 1974, and an estimated $770 million as of
September 30, 1975, equivalent to about six months imports at 1974 levels.
With a satisfactory foreign exchange position and increasing inflationary
pressures, further liberalization of import policies is warranted and can be
expected.



12.       Work on the Fourth Development Plan 1976-80 has been nearly com-
pleted. Preliminary indications are that the strategy of the forthcoming Plan
may not differ substantially from that of the previous Plan with heavy con-
centration of public sector investment on the development of agriculture, in-
cluding irrigation, as well as extractive industries, particularly oil and
phosphates. The investment rate is to be stepped up considerably, although
skilled manpower and domestic resources may be increasingly-felt constraints
on the growth of investment, particularly in the public sector. Taking these
factors into account, future prospects for the Syrian economy are favorable
and would be greatly enhanced if peace is restored to the area. The pragmatic
outlook of the present Government and the recent changes in the direction of
economic policies are likely to make it possible for the private sector to
contribute effectively to the future development and diversification of the
Syrian economy. Syria's oil output in 1975 was about 10 million tons worth
about $700 billion, which makes it eligible for membership in OPEC. Oil ex-
ports for 1975 provided foreign exchange for about one-half of imports and
export prospects are quite favorable. Syria has also substantial though low
quality phosphate reserves and while export prospects also look favorable,
revenues will depend on the fluctuation of the price level on the world
markets. Assuming that the Syrian authorities can keep current inflationary
pressures under control, real growth could exceed 9 percent per year between
1975 and 1980, with an assumed acceleration of the growth of investment and
exports by comparison with 1970-74 results. This would create substantial
import and external borrowing requirements.
13.       The country will, therefore, continue to need to borrow abroad to
finance development projects, particularly in the public sector. Excluding
external obligations contracted for military purposes, Syria's external public
debt amounted to $702 million by the end of 1974, and debt service payment on
external public debt (excluding military) were estimated at about $52 million,
equivalent to 5 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services at 1974
level. Although investment and growth targets of the Five-Year Plan (1976-
80) are uncertain, preliminary Bank projections estimate that on average the
resource gap may be about $445 million during 1976-80 with an implied gross
borrowing requirement of some $340 million per year over this period. Beyond
1980, however, capital requirements may be substantially larger as grant in-
flows may be reduced. Nevertheless, the debt service ratio is likely to be
well under 15 percent over the next decade and more.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SYRIA
14.       Syria has to date received    four IDA credit  totalling US$47.3
million and four loans totalling US$168.6 million, both net of cancellations.
All loans were made in 1974 and 1975. In addition, the Executive Directors
recently approved a US$35.0 million loan to Syria for a Second Damascus Water
Supply Project (see paragraph 17 below). Although Syria is a member of the
Corporation, IFC has made no investments. Annex II contains a summary state-
ment of IDA credits and Bank loans as of March 31, 1976 together with notes
on the execution of projects.



15.       Project implementation has generally suffered substantial delays
due largely to circumstances beyond Syria's control. The 1973 hostilities
brought works to a standstill and diverted the country's resources first to
military, then to reconstruction tasks although recovery was quite rapid
(paragraph 4). Continued unsettled conditions in the region compounded the
high rate of world inflation and, combined with local bottlenecks in the
administrative system and the construction industry, and the need for expen-
sive expatriate skilled labor, generated considerable cost overruns. Three
projects were most severely affected, the First Water Supply Project (Credit
401-SYR), the Balikh Irrigation Project (Credit 469-SYR and Loan 975-SYR), and
the first Mehardeh Power Project (Loan 986-SYR). As a result, the composition
of the Water Supply and the Power Projects had to be revised and additional
financing secured. In the case of the Balikh project, another cause of delays
was the difficulty to agree on bidding documents and procedures acceptable to
the Syrian authorities and the Bank; however, following discussions with the
Syrian Government, this question has now been resolved satisfactorily.
16.       Following the priorities assigned to investment under the Third De-
velopment Plan, past Bfank Group lending concentrated on infrastructure (about
two-thirds) and irrigation (one-third).   Lending to infrastructure, with power
accounting for about 50 percent of overall lending, highways about 10 percent
and water supply 7 percent, aimed at fostering well designed sector policies
and strengthening various public institutions in charge. The objective of
improving irrigation and drainage in the Euphrates Basin is to increase agri-
cultural employment, production and exports while reducing food imports, and
the dependency on weaither fluctuations. Although the Fourth Development Plan
has not yet been publLshed, there are strong indications that it will follow
the same strategy as the Third Plan. A number of substantial programs in
water supply, electricity, telecommunications, and highways are planned in
1976-1980, to bring t'hese sectors more in line with current needs, while Syria
will step up its effort to become self sufficient in and even an exporter of
food resources.
17.       The Bank envisages further support to the Government's strategy of
improving the infrastructure. Preparation of the Third Highway project is
underway and studies for a sewerage project which are financed from proceeds
of the first water supply project will commence shortly. The Second Damascus
Water Supply Project (see paragraph 14 above) includes the supply works needed
to complement the distribution system already under construction. The Arab
Fund for Social and Economic Development will provide co-financing for this
project. Continued support is also envisaged to the Government's strategy of
developing productive capacity in the agricultural sector.   While in the past,
lending for agriculture has been for irrigation, more emphasis will now be
given to projects increasing the productivity of Syria's 2.8 million ha of
rainfed land. To assist the Government in improving the living standards of
the rural population, the Bank has also incorporated in its lending program
and is now helping to prepare a project for rural electrification. A live-
stock project, involving, among other elements, credit for animal feed re-
quirements during dry years which would benefit about 17,000 semi-nomadic



- 6 -
families among the poorest in the country, has been appraised and is sche-
duled to be presented to the Executive Directors in the course of the cur-
rent fiscal year.
18.       Together with continued support of infrastructure and agriculture,
a degree of diversification is contemplated for future lending. In view of
Syria's drive to develop manufacturing industries, which will be accelerated
in the Fourth Development Plan, the Bank envisages assisting the development
of Syrian industry,possibly through a DFC project. Projects in education and
tourism are also planned.
19.       Through the lending activities described above, the Bank proposes
to put more emphasis in Syria on project preparation and implementation.
While in the short-term this may lead to increased utilization of expatriate
consultants, the longer term objective is to build up local expertise.
20.       As of the end of 1974, the Bank Group's share in Syria's external
public debt (excluding military) was estimated at 4 percent on a disbursement
basis. The share of the Bank Group in debt service was nil in 1974. By 1980,
the Bank Group's share in debt outstanding and in debt service are expected
to rise to about 17 percent and 11 percent respectively.
PART III - THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
21.       Syria's public telecommunications facilities are state-owned.     Prior
to 1975, the Post and Telecommunications Establishment (PTE), attached to the
Ministry of Communications, was responsible for both posts and telecommunica-
tions services. Although the telecommunications operations of PTE were fi-
nancially viable, the postal operations were unprofitable. In July 1975, a
new public entity was created, the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment
(STE). This separation from the postal service was intended to permit better
management of the more capital-intensive and technologically sophisticated
telecommunications services. STE is responsible for the development and opera-
tion of the domestic and international telephone, telegraph and telex services
in Syria.
Availability of Telecommunications Services
22.       Syria's telephone density of 2.14 per 100 inhabitants in January
1975 is about average for middle eastern countries. However, density in rural
areas is extremely low at 0.20 per 100 population. At present, of villages
with more than 1,000 population, only 29 percent have any telephone service.
As a result of the rapid growth in telephone demand since 1971 which accom-
panied the acceleration in Syria's economic growth, the waiting list for new
telephone connections grew by nearly 24 percent per year from 1971 to 1975.
In 1975, the waiting list totalled more than 120,000 applicants - a number
which exceeded the total number of lines already connected. Waiting time for
new connections in urban areas averaged about 7 years in 1974, although a
waiting time of over 9 years was not uncommon. The general shortage of public
telephones in both urban and rural areas also became more severe. The rate



-7 -
of availability of te:Lephone connections (defined as the working connections
divided by the sum of working connectiLons and waiting list), which had re-
mained at the low level of about 60 percent during the 1964-70 period, had
deteriorated to less than 50 percent of total expressed demand by 1974.
23.       The quality of telephone service is poor, due to the lack of an
adequate number of good quality circuits. Subscribers' complaints are high.
Congestion in exchange equipment severely limits service during peak hours.
There is extended delay on long distance calls between most centers. Trunk
dialing facilities are available only between the major cities. Only a small
proportion of calls are completed at the first attempt. The manually operated
long distance telephone service is also subject to long delays and suffers
from poor quality of transmission (25 percent of the calls are unsuccessful).
This has hampered the effective use of the service and reduced its revenue
potential. The inadequacy of telephone services has had an adverse effect on
all sectors of the widely dispersed Syrian economy, which cannot develop with
maximum efficiency without adequate telecommunications facilities.
Tariffs
24.       STE's tariffs have remained essentially unchanged since 1972.     The
basic features include a deposit before receiving service ranging from LS 150
for manual systems to LS 200 for automatic systems (US$40-54); installation
charges of LS 500 (US$135) for automatic subscribers and LS 30()-400 (US$80-108)
for manual subscribers depending on the region and the services available; an
annual rental (no local call charges) of LS 72 (US$19.50) for subscribers con-
nected to manual exchanges; an annual rental of LS 120 (US$32.40) including
1,000 free local cal]s per year for subscribers connected to automatic ex-
changes. The charge for a local call exceeding the 1,000 free call is LS 0.10
(2.7 US cents). The charge to all subscribers for long distance calls is LS
0.75 (20 US cents) per 100 km call distance for each three-minute conversation.
These rates are lower than those in countries at a similar stage of develop-
ment, which is further indicated by the low annual average revenue of about LS
406 (US$110 per subscriber). The corresponding revenues (in US$) for such
countries are as folLows:
Egypt      [raq     Ghana     Pakistan      Ethiopia     India
150      [62        211        224            236        253
The proposed increase in Syria's tariffs (paragraph 34)below will bring
Syria's revenues per subscriber more in line with the revenues earned from
these services in ot'her countries.
Fourth Five-Year Plan (1976-80) for Sector Expansion
25.       STE increased its investment in fixed assets by nearly eighty per-
cent during its third Five-Year Plan (1971-75) but this substantial expansion
in telephone services proved insufficient to meet the rapid increase in de-
mand experienced in the same period (see para. 22). Therefore, in 1975, the
Government agreed to provide the funds required to finance the initial stage



of a further STE expansion program: the installation of 100,000 additional
lines in the local service network and the establishment of an earth satel-
lite station to improve international telecommunication service. The Gov-
ernment also directed STE to prepare, and agreed to make additional funds
available for, a Fourth Five-Year Investment Plan which would significantly
improve telecommunications services in Syria.
26.       STE's fourth Five-Year Plan for development of telecommunications
therefore has the main objectives of (a) improving telecommunication services
to existing subscribers and (b) providing access to a substantial number of
new subscribers and areas which need these services. These objectives will
be achieved by the introduction of more modern equipment, by an increase in
traffic capacity in the local networks and by the replacement of obsolete
equipment and the installation of additional systems and circuits in the
domestic and international long distance systems. The Plan provides for (a)
300,000 additional automatic telephone connections in urban areas (b) 20,000
additional manual telephone connections in rural areas, (c) access to the
telephone system for about 800 villages presently without telephone facilities,
(d) expansion of long distance facilities, (e) expansion of the international
facilities and (f) establishment of a new telecommunications training center
in Damascus. Two hundred thousand lines of local telephone exchange equipment
and associated buildings and cable networks, out of the total of 300,000 lines
proposed in the Plan, are to be financed as a separate package under bilateral
arrangements. By the end of 1980, the expanded local telephone network should
be able to satisfy most of the projected new demand as well as the presently
unsatisfied demand for connections in the country.
27.       The investments proposed in the Five-Year Plan will result in a
more than fivefold increase in assets, at a total estimated cost of about
US$333.7 million, including a foreign exchange component of US$217.7 million.
The distribution of the proposed investments among the major segments of the
Plan are described in STE's Five Year Investment Plan, below:

28.       The first phase of the Plan, to be implemented in the period 1976-
78, consists of (a) works in the Bank assisted project, (b) other works in
STE's program, and (c) commencement of the works included in the "special"
project. The total investment for this first phase is estimated at about LS
731.5 million (US$197.7 million) with a foreign exchange component of LS 489.0
million (US$132.2 million).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
29.       This project was appraised by a Bank mission to Syria in October/
November 1975. At negotiations in Washington in April 1976, the Syrian dele-
gation was led by Mr. Abdul Sater Atassi, Director General of STE. An Ap-
praisal Report, No. 1053-SYR of April 30, 1976 is being circulated separately
to the Executive Directors. A loan and project summary is given in Annex III.
Project Description
30.       The project consists of a balanced and integrated package selected
from among the most urgent works to be included in the first (1976-78) phase
of the Five Year Plan (see paragraphs 27 and 28 above). During the 1976-78
period the project would provide about 87,000 additional telephone connec-
tions, connecting about 540 villages to the network. Local telephone networks
would be rehabilitated and traffic capacity expanded. The long distance
Damascus-Aleppo-Palmyra coaxial cable system would be completed as well as the
Homs-Raqqa-Hassake microwave system, and the obsolete Damascus-Aleppo-Lattakia-
Raqqa microwave system would be replaced, thus providing an adequate number of
circuits between the main centers. Subscriber trunk dialing facilities would
be installed to provide long distance services among major cities. Present
microwave/UHF systems are to be extended to serve a number of spur routes to
widely dispersed regions presently lacking adequate telecommunications serv-
ices. The international telephone and telex services will be considerably
improved with completion of an earth station. In addition, a new telecommuni-
cations training center will be established in Damascus. The project is to
be completed by December 31, 1978.
Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
31.       The total cost of the proposed project is about US$145.6 million,
of which US$94.3 million is foreign exchange. The Bank loan would contribute
US$28 million towards the foreign exchange costs of the telephone network and
the microwave/UHF equipment components of the project.
32.       Cost estimates are based on STE's recent experience adjusted to end
of 1975 price levels. Firm contracts have been placed for a substantial part
of the exchange equipment and the national long-distance and international
networks, neither of which would be financed by the Bank loan. For this
equipment, cost estimates are based on actual contract prices. Contingencies
have been estimated on the other items. A physical contingency of 4 percent



- 10 -
has been allowed for in foreign and local costs of items such as buildings
and equipment, which is sufficient to cover unforeseen changes in the de-
tailed specifications. No physical contingency is provided for cable net-
works and rural networks for which experience has confirmed that it is pos-
sible to keep overall costs within the estimates. Price contingencies are
based on increases of (a) 10 percent in 1976, 8 percent in 1977 and there-
after in costs for imported equipment and (b) 20 percent in 1976, 16 percent
in 1977 and thereafter in local costs. The resulting estimated overall price
increases amount to about 11.9 percent of the base cost plus physical con-
tingencies.
33.       STE will contribute, from internal cash generation and subscribers'
deposits about 35 percent of the investment requirements for the project.
Suppliers credits and the Bank loan would each provide for about 20 percent
of the project's financial requirements. The Government will contribute the
remaining 25 percent of these requirements as equity.
Financial Situation
34.      STE's recent financial performance has been satisfactory.     STE's
rate of return averaged over 16 percent for 1970-74 and reached 18 percent in
1974. Although the low level of telephone tariffs has been adequate to per-
mit moderate telecommunications expansion in the past, it would not sustain
STE's financial viability during the new expansion period. In order to make
reasonable contributions to the financing of its investment program, as well
as to avert a severe cash shortage which would otherwise develop in late 1976
and in 1977, STE will need to considerably increase its internal cash genera-
tion. STE and the Government have therefore agreed to a revision of STE's
telephone tariffs, to take effect from October 1, 1976,which would increase
STE's net revenues for 1976 by 10 percent,equivalent to a 40 percent annual
increase (Section 5.06 of Loan Agreement). The tariff revision will raise
rentals and call charges for automatic subscribers by 50 percent and reduce
the present 1,000 free calls per year to 500. The new tariff structure will
also increase the installation charge for new automatic subscribers from the
present LS 500 to LS 1,000; however, this increase will apply only to large
centers. Tariffs will not be increased as much for manual subscribers, most
of whom live in rural areas. The new tariff is based on studies undertaken
by STE over the past three years and are designed to provide adequate funds
for expansion while still encouraging development in rural areas.
35.       Past telecommunications expansion programs were almost entirely fi-
nanced from the entity's own resources, which resulted in a low debt-equity
ratio of 3:97 at the-end of 1974. Due to the large-scale borrowing required
to financing STE's future expansion, the debt equity ratio will increase from
5:95 at December 31, 1975 to 45:55 at December 31, 1979. Thereafter the ratio
is expected to steadily improve due to substantial repayment of debt and rapid
growth in revenues. STE's post-1980 financial position is expected to be
quite satisfactory. Despite STE's future heavy debt service requirements re-
sulting from above borrowings, internal cash generation would cover annual



- 11 -
debt service at least three times throughout the forecast period 1975-80.
However, in order to help ensure STE's future viability, it has been agreed
that STE will not contract long-term debt unless the preceding 12 months' net
revenues will cover the maximum future debt service at least 1.5 times (Sec-
tion 5.08 of Loan Agreement). The average annual growth of revenues during
the Plan period, 1976-80, would be about 35 percent while expenses would grow
at only about 30 percent, thus resulting in satisfactory operating ratios.
36.       With the proposed tariff increases (paragraph 33 above) and the
initially slow increase of the asset base during the project period, it is
estimated that STE's rate of return on assets would be about 16.7 percent at
the end of the first project year (1976). Thereafter, as STE's major expan-
sion adds rapidly to its assets and before full revenues from these assets
are realized, the rate of return would drop to a low point of 12.8 percent in
1978, the last year of the project implementation period. In both 1979 and
1980 STE's rate of return would exceed 13.5 percent and it would increase
steadily thereafter. Agreement has been reached with STE to maintain tariffs
at a level sufficient to produce an annual rate of return of not less than
11 percent on the average current net values of fixed telecommunication assets
in operation, as revalued from time to time in accordance with consistently
maintained methods acceptable to the Bank (Section 5.07 of Loan Agreement).
This is the minimum level which would permit STE to meet its capital servic-
ing requirements and provide self-financing for an acceptable proportion of
its construction requirements (see paragraph 34 above).
Management and Organization
37.       The 1971 law governing STE provides it with a satisfactory degree of
autonomy in its operations and enables it to function as a commercial entity.
STE is governed by a Board headed by its Director General, who is appointed by
a Presidential Decree. In addition the Board consists of the five heads of
STE's departments and a representative of the workers, all appointed by the
Minister of Communications. The Board is empowered to set policies, regula-
tions and tariffs. The government will, however, approve STE's investment
plans, provide major financial support and be consulted on all important
policy matters.
38.       While STE has existed as an independent entity only since July 1975,
the telecommunication service has been a well-established component of the PTE
establishment for many years. The general manager of STE is a highly capable
manager and experienced telecommunications engineer. STE's technical and
management staff are considered competent and many had a long-term associa-
tion with its predecessor organization.   The Bank has reviewed STE's new staf-
fing plan and found it satisfactory.
39.       In view of the extensive expansion program which is being undertaken,
a number of measures are being instituted to reinforce STE's coordination and
supervision capabilities. STE is constructing a new facility to permit expan-
sion and improvement of its Training Centre, which presently provides extended
training for technicians as well as vocational and refresher courses. Several



- 12 -
foreign governments and UNDP are expected to provide assistance for the ex-
panded Training Centre. STE is also developing a systematic manpower recruit-
ment and training program and is arranging for its administrative staff to re-
ceive advanced training in accounting and financial techniques (Sections 4.03
and 4.04 of Loan Agreement). These programs are well designed. STE will re-
port periodically to the Bank on the implementation of these programs. These
efforts should insure that the organization will be fully qualified to meet
the substantial project execution and supervision requirements of its expan-
sion program.
40.       It has been agreed that STE's accounts would be audited by indepen-
dent auditors acceptable to the Bank and that STE would provide audited finan-
cial statements to the Bank within five months after the close of each fiscal
year (Section 5.03 of Loan Agreement).
Project Execution
41.        STE would prepare the specifications and bidding documents for the
cable networks, microwave equipment and rural network materials. The sup-
plier would install and commission the microwave equipment and rural network
materials. STE would lay and joint the cables and install the subscriber
facilities. In the case of the telephone switching equipment not financed by
the Bank, the suppliers would supervise installation by STE's personnel.
STE's Director of Projects would monitor the execution of the Bank-financed
project. The civil works, buildings, access roads and major duct routes to be
financed by STE would be carried out by local contractors under STE's super-
vision.
Procurement and Disbursement
42.       All equipment and material financed by the Bank would be subject to
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines
for Procurement." A 15 percent preference margin, or the prevailing customs
duty, whichever is lower, would be extended to local manufacturers in the
evaluation of bids for rural network materials submitted under international
competitive bidding. The proposed loan would be disbursed against 100 per-
cent of the foreign cost of imported equipment and materials and installation
costs for the additional lines and facilities. The estimated schedule of dis-
bursement is included in Annex III. To allow sufficient time for final in-
voices, a closing date of June 30, 1979, i.e. 6 months after completion of
work, is proposed.
Justification
43.       The proposed project, together with related projects forming STE's
five year telecommunications investment plan, is essential if Syria is to
achieve a communications system commensurate with her economic development
requirements. The major elements of the project represent the least-cost
solution, chosen from among several alternatives.



- 13 -
44.       Syria's widely dispersed economic activities create a need for sat-
isfactory country-wide communications. Available data indicate that telephone
service is extensively used for economically productive purposes. Various
surveys of telephone usage indicate that up to 86 percent of the telephone
installations may be considered business telephones, including those used by
the Government and its agencies. As the shortage and poor quality of service
is considered a major bottleneck to economic development in both urban and
rural areas, the Syrian Government has placed a heavy emphasis on improved
telecommunications in the 1976-1980 Five Year Plan (paragraph 26)..
45.       The access to telephone service in rural areas is very low consid-
ering the importance of agriculture to the Syrian economy. A large majority
of the villages do not have any access. During the project period (1976-78),
STE expects to connect about 540 villages presenitly without telephone facili-
ties and about 12,000 acLditional manual subscribers in rural areas. At the
end of of the Plan in 1980, with the provision of access to a total of 800
villages, the network will cover most of the"larger villages not previously
served by the telephone system. The rural network will benefit the less af-
fluent rural population. A major part of the network will be located in the
Euphrates, Balikh and lhabour Valleys where most of Syria's irrigation schemes
will also be located and are thus expected to complement and enhance the im-
pact of these schemes.
46.       According to S,TE's conservative forecasts, by the end of the devel-
opment plan period in 1980, about 86 percent of total expressed demand will
be satisfied in urban areas and 100 percent in rural areas, as compared to the
1974 level of about 48 percent in urban and 57 percent in rural areas. The
waiting list would be reduced to about 59,000. Waiting time for new connec-
tions now about seven years on average will decrease somewhat at the end of
the project in 1978, but the waiting time will be reduced to less than two
years only by the end of the Plan period in 1980.
47.       The expansion of long distance facilities in the project will bring
about major improvements in the speed of connection and the quality of long
distance calls in the country. The expansion will establish reliable communi-
cations with new economic development areas such as the Lower Euphrates Valley
and the phosphate producing region south of Palmyra and improve telecommuni-
cations between the coastal cities. In addition, this extension of Syria's
long distance services will increase the capacity for new intraregional and
international communications through Syria, particularly with Iraq and the
Gulf States and Egypt.
48.       The internal rate of return on the project, defined as the discount
rate which equalizes the stream of expected revenues (including effects of
tariff increase) pertaining to the project with the attributable capital and
operating cost (excluding taxes, duties and contingencies), is 20.6 percent,
which is satisfactory. A sensitivity analysis shows that under the most un-
favorable combination cf main parameters -- a 10 percent increase in capital
and operating cost and a 10 percent decrease in revenues -- the rate of re-
turn would be not less than 14.7 percent.



- 14 -
49.       The economic rate of return of the project is undoubtedly higher
because the project cost includes the full cost of extending service to new
areas and providing a high capacity system, the full benefits of which will
only be obtained in the future when additional lines or circuits are con-
nected. Moreover, there are external benefits which accrue to parties other
than those who pay directly for the use of the facilities. Also, the prices
charged for these facilities do not adequately measure the full benefits to
the consumers.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
50.       The Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Syrian Telecommunica-
tions Establishment, the Guarantee Agreement between the Syrian Arab Republic
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Sec-
tion 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a draft resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
51.       Features of the Agreement of special interest are described in para-
graphs 34, 35, 36, 39 of this report.
52.       I am satisfied that the proposed    Loan would comply with the Arti-
cles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
53.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Loan.

Credit 290 - Second Highway Project; US$13.8 million credit of April 17, 1972;
Date of Effectiveness: February 2, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
This project inclutles improvement and construction of 153 km of
roads linking Dan,ascus with the Lebanese and Jordanian borders, and improve-
ment of the Tartous-Homs road. It also includes feasibility studies and
detailed engineering for bypasses for the Jities of Homs, Hama, Aleppo and
Deraa and the Aleppo-Tall Kojak Road (about 470 km).   Project implementation
started in 1975, after an initial delay due to the unsettLed con(ditions in
the region. tn the meantime, the government decIded to upgrade the project
roads to four--lane standards for which it has undertaken to provide additional
funds. Arrangements have been made to assess the economic viability of the new
designs.
Credit 401 - Damascus Water Supply Project; US$15 million Credit of June 22,
1973; Date of Effectiveness: February 24, 1974: Closing Date: December 31,
1978
This project consisted of five main elements: (i) rehabilitation and
renewal of existing distribution system; (ii) expansion of distribution system
with 370 km of watermains; (iii) construction of a 15-km tunnel to improve the
supply of water to the city; (iv) pumping and storage facilities; and (v) stu-
dies of pollution and sewerage problems in Damascus, Hams and Hama. Delay in
the execution of the project and high cost overruns prompted the Syrians to
split the works of this project and on M1ay 12, 1975, the Association agreed
that IDA credit would be used onlv for the urgent phase of the distribution
works (item i) and for pollution and sewerage studies (item v). It was
deemed important to move ahead quickly with the rehabilitation and renewal
of the existing distribution system in order to reduce the amount of water
currently not accounted fo,- due to leakages in the mains and malfunctioning
of the water meters. The work on the urgent phase of the distribution system
is in progress.

the progress of projects in execution, and irn particular to repoct
any problems which are being encountered and the action being caken
to correct them. They should be read in this sense and with under-
standing that they do not purport to present a ba½Anred evaluation

Credit 469/Loan 975 - Balikh Irrigation Projects; US$10 million Credit and
US$63 million Loan of April 6, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: September 12,
1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The project provides for the development of irrigated agriculture
in an area of 48,000 ha gross (with a net area which recently was increased
from 41,000 to 45,000 ha) in the Balikh river basin, and the resettlement of
farmers displaced by the filling of Lake Assad. The project includes consul-
tant services from the preparation of an agricultural rehabilitation master
plan in the Euphrates Valley, the preparation of a feasibility study for a
55,00 hectares rehabilitation project also in the Valley and the preparation
of detailed designs and contracts' documents for the same area. The project
suffers from substantial delays and cost overruns due for a large part to the
general situation in the region. Bids for the first three civil works con-
tracts have now been recleived, evaluated and awarded. The Government will
have to arrange for the mobilization of substantial additional financial
resources to meet the project's likely increase in foreign exchange require-
ments.  Adequate technical solutions now seem to have been found for problems
of canal construction in gypsoferous soil which has beset works in pilot
areas, provided that supervision ip sufficient to ensure the observance of
high standards of construction by contractors. Procurement for the next two
irrigation areas Is expected to be initiated soon.
Loan 986 , Mehardeh Powerc Project; US$25 million Loan of May 23, 1974 and
Supplementary Loan of $8.6 million of April 29; Date of Effectiveness:

crease in capacity of the first unit from 125-MW to 150-MW. The Amending
Agreements became effective on January 19, 1976. Although main contracts
were awarded about 5 months late, physical progress is satisfactory and
ultimate delays are expected to be minimal.
