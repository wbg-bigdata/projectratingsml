SYRIAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS ESTABLISHKENT (STE)
APPRAISAL OF A TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of the First Telecommrunications
Project in Syria, for which a Bank loan of US$28.0 million is proposed.
The Borrower and the Beneficiary would be the Syrian Telecommunications
Establishment (STE), which has responsibility for public telecommunication
services in the country.
ii.       Telephone services in Syria are inadequate in both extent and
quality. Failure to meet the demand has resulted in a waiting list larger
than the total number of connected lines (DELs), with applicants usually
having to wait several years for a connection. The quality of local
telephone service is poor, mainly due to overloading in some of the tele-
phone exchanges; there is inordinate delay on long distance telephone calls
between most centers. This inadequacy of the telephone services has had an
adverse effect on all sectors of the widely dispersed Syrian economy, which
cannot develop with maximum efficiency without adequate telecommunication
facilities.
iii.      Government has set specific targets for STE to overcome these
deficiencies during the fourth plan period (1976-80) by improving and
expanding STE's facilities.  Specifically, 300,000 additional telephone
connections are to be provided in urban areas together with 20,000 addi-
tional telephones in rural areas and extension of service to 800 villages.
Improvement of the long distance service is planned with the provision of
large-capacity transmission systems between all main centers and develop-
ment of the subscriber trunk dialing (STD) network. International services
are to be improved by installing an earth station near Damascus and submarine
cables in the Mediterranean Sea.
iv.       The plan incorporates (a) the carrying forward of unfinished works
from the third plan period (1971-75), (b) new works within the execution
capability of STE in the fourth plan period, and (c) a special projoct for
the installation of 200,000 lines which will be executed with special
assistance from the equipment suppliers. The cost of the plan is estimated
at about LS 1,234.8 (US$333.7) million, with a foreign exchange component
of LS 805.6 (US$217.7) million. The project, consisting of the most urgent
works included in the first three years (1976-78) of the plan, forms a
balanced and integrated package. The estimated cost of the project is
IS 538.8 (US$145.6) mlllion, with a foreign exchange component of LS 348.8
(US$9h.3) million.
v.        During the 1976-78 period the project would provide about 87,000
additional telephone connections', relieving somewhat the outstanding demand



- ii -
and connecting about 540 villages to the network. The local telephone
network would also be rehabilitated and traffic capacity expanded, leading
to improvement in the quality of service. With completion of the long
distance Damascus-Aleppo-Palmyra coaxial cable systems and the Homs-
Raqqa-Hassake microwave systems, an adequate number of circuits will become
available between the main centers. The installation of spur routes will
provide secondary centers with more reliable communications. These
together with expansion of subscriber trunk dialing (STD) facilities, will
improve the quality and availability of the long distance services and
stimulate additional demand. The international telephone and telex services
will be considerably improved with completion of the earth station.
vi.       Of the US$94.3 million total foreign exchange cost of the project,
about US$28.7 million has been secured under suppliers' credits and bilateral
loans. The proposed Bank loan would provide US$28.0 million, leaving a
balance of US$37.6 million to be financed by STE and Government. The project
would be executed by STE with some assistance from the equipment suppliers.
The arrangements within STE for supervision of project execution and instal-
lations are satisfactory.
vii.      All procurement under the proposed Bank loan would be subject to
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines
for Procurement.
viii.     STE is governed by Syrian Law No. 18 of 1974, which provides for
adequate day-to-day autonomy in its operations. STE's organization is now
being restructured following separation of the postal and telecommunications
operations. STE's management is satisfactory. STE plans to develop its
manpower, recruitment and training program to ensure effective coordination of
execution of its special project and operation of the facilities in addition
to the normal expansion program.
ix.       STE's operating results have been satisfactory and its financial
position is sound. However, in order to carry out the large expansion pro-
gram, STE will have to considerably increase its internal cash generation
and take up substantial borrowings. For this purpose, STE proposes to
raise tariffs, which are low, providing for an increase in telephone reve-
nues of about 40%. In addition to the funds available from internal cash
generation, suppliers' credits, bilateral loans and the proposed Bank loan,
Government will have to provide substantial funds to meet requirements
during the 1976-78 period. On the basis of the proposed tariff increase
and Government's financial assistance, STE would continue to be finan-
cially viable. The internal rate of return of the project is estimated
at 20.6%.
x.        The proposed project forms a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$28.0 million equivalent to STE for a term of 20 years, including a
four-year grace period.



1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Syria has requested Bank assistance in financing
telecommunications development for the fourth plan period (1976-80) to be
undertaken by the Syrian Telecoimmiications Establishment (STE). The plan
is designed to improve and expand the telecommunication services by meeting
most of the outstanding and anticijpated demand by 1980 for local telephone
service as well as providing fast arid reliable long distance services,
both domestic and international, along with substantial expansion of the
telex service.
1.02      The project constitutes the most urgent works in the first phase
of the plan during the 1976-78 period and is estimated to cost about
LS 5.38.8 (US$145.6) million, with a foreign exchange component of LS 348.8
(US$ 94.3) million, of which US$28.0 million would be financed by the Bank
loan. About US$28.7 million has been secured under suppliers' credits and
bilateral loans, and the balance Vill be financed by STE and Government.
1.03      STE would be the Borrower and Beneficiary.
1.04      This would be the first B3ank Group operation in the telecomoni-
cations sector in Syria.
1.05      This report is based on information provided by STE and on the
findings of a mission composed of M{essrs. S. Sathar, H. Hillebrenner and
Y. Kubo which visited Syria in October/November 1975.
2. THE SECTOR
B,ackcground. 
2.01      Syria's public telecomnmuication facilities are State-owned.
Prior to 1975 the Posts and Telecommunications Establishment (PTE),
attached to the Ministry of Communications, was responsible for postal and
telecommunication services.  With effect from July 1975, a new public entity
entitled the Syrian TelecommunicatLons Establishaent (STE), governed by
Law No. 18 of 1974, has been creatsd and made responsible for the develop-
ment and operation of the domestic and international telephone, telegraph
and telex services in the country. Basic data on existing facilities are
given in Annex 1, and a description of these facilities is at Annex 2.
2.02      Syria's widely dispersed and rapidly growing economic activities
create a need for satisfactory country-wide communications. The largest
single sector is agriculture, provlding employment for 51% of the labor
force and accounting for 22% of GD]P and about 30% of total export earnings
in 1 4. Agricultural production is spread throughout the country
(185,000 km2 in area) with the major concentration in the coastal,northern
and northeastern regions along the band of heavy rainfall. Other major
sectors of the economy are industry and commerce. The extractive industry
(mainly oil and phosphates) is another major source of export earnings,
accounting for about 55% of total iexports in 1974. Most of the oil



-2-
p:roduction is in the northeastern part of the country. Manufacturing and
commercial activities are concentrated in Damascus, Aleppo and other prin-
cipal cities which are widely separated. The main ports (Latakia, Tartous
and Banias) are located far from the production and consumption centers.
2.03      Following the reorientation of Syria's economic policy in 1970,
the average annual growth of real GDP during the 1970-74 period was 10%
as compared with 4.5% during 1964-70. Reflecting this high rate of economic
growth, demand for telecommmnication services has been growing rapidly in
the various sectors of the economy, especially in commerce, industry and
agriculture, with Government and professionals (doctors, lawyers,etc.)
adding to the demand. Good telecommunication services are essential for
Syria's coordinated economic development, facilitating comercial trans-
actions, procurement of supplies, and transport and marketing of products.
But the existing telecommunication facilities do not provide fast and
efficient services, and STE has been unable to meet the growing demand. This
situation constitutes a major bottleneck to economic development in both the
urban and rural areas; hence, Government has placed a heavy emphasis on
improved telecommunications, as evidenced by the specific targets set for
telecommunications development in the fourth five-year plan (para. 2.09).
Access to Telephone Services
2.0L      Syria's telephone density of 2.14 per 100 population as of January
1975, compared with that of other Mideastern countries, is relatively higher
than some (Iraq - 1.42; Algeria - 1.38; Egypt - 1.37) but lower than others
(Iran - 2.40; Turkey - 2.30) (see Annex 3). Major telecommunications develop-
ment programs are being undertaken in most of these countries, however, and
dlespite its development program Syria will maintain a lower growth rate over
the next two to three years than that planned iniqeighboring Turkey and Iran.
The telephone densities in urban and rural areas   are given in Annex 4;
they reveal a low density of 0.20 per 100 population in the rural areas.
2.o5      Telephone availability2/in Syria had been fairly stable at about
60)% during 1964-70; but due to the rapid increase in demand and the inade-
qLuate supply of telephone connections since 1970, the rate had fallen to
less than 50% by 1974 (Annex 5). There is also a general shortage of public
I/ According to STE's classification, adopted in this report, "urban"
areas include all the provincial capitals and communities with more
than 20,000 population. The rest of the country is defined as "rural"
areas, with each community in these areas referred to as a "village".
-- Telephone availability is defined as the working connections divided
by the sum of working connections and waiting list.



-3-
telephones in both urban and rural areas. Telephone availability by prin-
cipal areas as of December 31, 1'374, was as follows:
Wlorking    Waiting    Telephone
Connections     List    Availability
Damascus               49,504      55,063        47%
Other urban areas      59,616       61,271       49%
Rural areas             7,467       5,546        57%
Total     116,587     121,880        48.9%
2.06      The availability indicated for rural areas underestimates true
demand because waiting lists are not prepared in areas which have no
facilities. Access to telephone service in the rural areas is very low,
with a large majority of the villages having no access.  The table at
Annex 6 shows that of the villages with more than 1,000 population, only
29% have serrice; Annex 7 shows -that of the remaining 71% without service,
comprising 670 villages, 566 have a population of more than 700 and 104
have more than 2,000 population.
Users of Telephone Services
2.07      STE does not maintain telephone statistics by type of use, but
a survey of 18 small exchanges in the vicinity of provincial capitals shows
that 55% of the telephones are installed at business premises (Annex 8);
moreover, a large majority (about 70%) of the telephones at residential
locations is being used for productive purposes (Annex 9).  Overall, about
86% of the telephones surveyed are considered to be business telephones,
including those used by Government and its agencies. For larger exchange
areas, sample surveys have indicated telephones at definitely identifiable
business locations as 46.5% in Daraa and Y4.0% in Damascus. As in the case
of small exchange areas, most of the telephones at residential locations
are used for productive purposes. A telephone revenue analysis in Damascus
also indicated extensive use for business purposes.
Quality of Telephone Service
2.08      The quality of local telephone service is poor.  Subscribers
cannot establish connections during peak hours because of congestion in
some of the exchanges. The number of subscriber complaints is very high in
Damascus, and the time required to clear faults is long. The present
long distance service is likewise inadequate. Subscriber trunk dialing
(STD) facilities between Damascus, Homs, Hama, Daraa and Zabdani are quite
satisfactory. STD service betweien Aleppo and Latakia, Raqqa, Deir-ez-Zor
and Hassake is not satisfactory due to a lack of good quality and adequate
number of circuits.  Over the mainually operated circuits, waiting time for
connection between major cities is long, with delays of several hours and
poor quality of transmission. T'his has hampered effective use of the
service and reduced its revenue potential. As shown in Annex 10, about
25% of calls are unsuccessful. Trunk line faults and poor connections are
also high, accounting in some cases for up to 21% of failures. Despite the

poor quality of service, the average growth in domestic traffic during the
1971-74 period has been about 17% and in international traffic about 14%
(Annex 11).
Sector ObJectives
2.059     STEts fourth five-year plan for telecommunications development has
the main objectives of (a) improving telecommunication services to existing
subscribers in the country, and (b) providing access to a substantial number
of new subscribers and areas 'which need these services. The local telephone
service will be improved by the introduction of more modern equipment and an
increase in traffic capacity.  The availability and quality of the domestic
and international long distance services will be improved by the replacement
of obsolete equipment and the installation of additional systems and circuits.
The plan will provide for (a) 300,000 additional automatic telephone connec-
tions in urban areas, (b) 20,000 additional manual telephone connections in
rural areas, (c) access to the telephone system for about 800 villages
presently without telephone facilities, (d) expansion of the long distance
facilities, (e) expansion of the international facilities, and (f) estab-
lisiment of a new telecommunications training center in Damascus.
2.10      By end of 1980 with the planned expansion of the local facilities,
the network should be able to satisfy most of the projected demand for tele-
phone connections in the country. The telephone availability rate will
increase to about 86% in urban areas and 100% in rural areas, compared with
the 1974 level of about 48% in urban and 57% in rural areas.  The number of
villages with telephone-facilities will increase from 360 in 1974 to 1,160
in 1980, and about 60% of the rural population will have access to the
telephone system, compared with about 25% in 1974 (paras. 2.06, 4.05).
2.11      Expected changes in some parameters, reflecting the availability
of telephone service between 1974, 1978 and 1980, are shown below.

After completion of the project in 1978, telephone densities and avail-
ability would improve significantly throughout the country but the unsatis-
fied demand would not be fully met; however, it would be reduced to a
reasonable level by 1980 at the end of the plan period. The extent and
quality of the local and long distance services would also be considerably
improved with completion of the project.
Investment Plan
2.12      PTE's investments during the third five year (1971-75) plan
period was about LS 130 (US$35) million and was dependent for financing
entirely upon PTE's own resources and minor suppliers' credits.  The program
was inadequate to meet the existing demand. This, added to the rapid increase in
economic activity since 1971 resulted in a heavy backlog of demand needing
a very substantial increase in investment to provide some measure of relief.
During 1975 the last year of the third plan, Government extended financial
support to enable PTE to undertake a telephone expansion of 100,000 lines and
also establish an earth satellite station to improve the international
telecommunication service.  Goverment also separated the telecommimication
service from PTE by creating STE and gave directions to the newly formed
entity to develop the fourth five year plan with a view to meet all the
pending and expected demand during the plan period and substantially improve
the service to bring it to a satisfactory level.
2.13      To implement the sector objectives during the fourth five-year plan
period (FY1976-80), STE has provided for a total plan investment of about
US$333.7 million, with a foreign exchange component of about US$217.7
million. The planned investment would result in a more than fivefold
increase in assets. The distribution of investment between local telephone,
telegraph and long distance domestic and international networks is as follows:

Sector Constraints
2.14      Until 1974, telecommunications development was financed from STE's
own resources and through minor suppliers's credits. The debt/equity ratio
was very low - 3/97. In order to make reasonable contributions to the 1976-78
financing plan, STE will need to considerably increase its internal cash
generation and take ulD substantial borrowings. STEts present tariffs have
not changed since 1972 and are low. STE has therefore proposed to Govern-
ment to revise tariffs which will increase STE's telephone revenues by about
40%. Government is expected to approve these proposals, which in the
19715-78 period should provide for contributions by internal generation of
abolut 27% of requirements. Borrowings, including the proposed Bank loan,
wouLd account for about 55% and Government will contribute 18%.
2.15      One of the main constraints to development of this sector, assuming
that financing is secured for all the works in the five-year plan, is the
lim:Lted availability of skilled manpower. While the expansion of the tele-
commwnications training center provided for in the program will help to
correct this, STE needs to give special attention to the recruitment and
training of a substantial number of additional staff required for execution
of the large expansion program and operation of the facilities. STE during
negotiations provided an acceptable outline of a plan and agreed to develop
the program of manpower recruitment and training for review by the Bank.
(para. 5.06).
2.16      Although STE's new status as a public establishment provides for
adeqlaate day-to-day autonomy in operations, its organization needs to be
improved with respect to planning and coordination of execution of Drojects.
STE therefore intends to streamline its organization with respect to the above as
well as in the operations, accounting and financial areas. STE has agreed during
negoltiations to forward to the Bank for comments the details of its organization
at headquarters and regions which is presently under review (para. 5.o2).
3. THE PROGRAM AND PROJECT
The Plan
3.01      The Government of Syria has approved a telecommunications develop-
ment plan for the period 1976-80 which forms part of Syria's fourth five-year
plan. The proposed total outlay for the plan during 1976-80 (including the
special project) is about LS 1,234.8 (US$333.7) million, with a foreign
excbhange component of LS 805.6 (US$217.7) million. The plan includes (a)
the ongoing works of the third plan period, (b) new works in the fourth plan
period, and (c) a special project for the installation of 200,000 lines of
local telephone exchange equipment, associated buildings and cable net-
works, installation of 'which is beyond STE's normal execution capability
and therefore would be executed with special assistance from equipment
suppliers. The arrangements for the phasing and execution of the special
project are under discussion with interested suppliers and bilateral govern-
ment aid agencies.  The details of the plan and investments, including the
special project, are given in Annexes 12 and 13.

The Program
3.02     STE's telecommunications investment for the first three years,
1976-78 -- the first phase of the fourth plan period (1976-80) -- con-
Btitutes the program. The program comprises (a) works in the Bank assiated
project, (b) other works in STE's program, and (c) commencement of the works
included in the special project. The total investment for this program iJ
estimated at about LS 731.5 (US$197.7) million, with a foreign exchange
component of LS 489.0 (US$132.2) million. Details are in Annex 12.
The Project
3.03     The project oonsists of the following most urgent works in this
program during 1976-78 and constitutes a balanced and integrated package:
(a) installation  of about 75,000 automatic telephone con-
nections;
(b) installation of abaut 12,000 mnual telephone connections;
(c) provision of telephone access to about 540 villages;
(d) expansion of long distance telecomunications facilities
with the

Djerablous, Raqqa-Tall Abiad, Hassake-Ras al Ain,
Hassake-Qamishliye, and Deir-ez-Zor-Abou Kemal;
(e) cmpletion of installation of autmatic trunk exchanges with
2,800 lines;
(f) instalLation of about 300 teleprinters for the telegraph and
telex services;
(g) expansion of the international facilities with installation
of an earth station working via the Indian Ocean satellite;



- 8 -
(h)  provision of an international telephone switching center
for about 800 lines; and
(i)  establishment of a new telecommunications training center
in Damascus.
The items proposed for Bank financing (para. 3.08) are mainly concerned with
the works in (a) through (d) above.
Cost Estimates
3.014     The total cost of the project is estimated at about IS 538.8
(US$145.6) million, with a foreign exchange component of IS 348.8 (Us$94.3)
million. The cost details are given in Annex 18 and summarized below:

3.05      The project cost estimates are based on STE's recent experience,
adJulsted to end of 1975 price levels. For a major part of the telephone
exchange equipment and some of the long distance networks not financed by
the Bank loan, actual contract prices have been used. The local costs, in
addition to civil works, include (a) salaries of STE's personnel used to
construct cable networks and to help install exchanges and subscriber lines,
and (b) import duties of from 22% to 35% which STE is required to pay to
Government.
Contingencies
3.065     In the case of a substantial part of the telephone exchange equip-
men-t and the national long distance and international networks, firm



- 9 -
contracts have been placed. Contingencies have been estimated on the other
items. A physical contingency of 4% has been provided in the foreign and
local costs of such items as bu:LLdings and equipment; this would be suffi-
cient to cover unforeseen changes in requirements which might occur when
the detailed specifications are drawn up. In the case of cable networks
and rural networks, no physical contingency is provided as the dispersion
of these networks throughout the country permits flexibility and adjustnent
to keep overalL costs within the estimates. The price contingencies are
based on increases of (a) 10% in 1976 and 8% in 1977 and thereafter in
costs of equipment, and (b) 20% in 1976 and 16% in 1977 and thereafter in
local costs of labor and civil works. These are considered adequate. The
resulting estimated overall price increases amount to about 1L.9%.of the
base cost estimates plus physical contingencies. Details of the contingency
provision are given in Annex 19
Financing of Project
3.07      Of the UST 94.3 million of total foreign exchange cost of the
project, about US$28.7 million has been secured under suppliers' credits
and bilateral loans.  The proposed Bank loan would provide US$28.0 million,
leaving a balance of US$37.6 miLlion to be financed by STE and Government.
The local cost of US$51.3 million of the project would be financed by STE.
Items for Bank Financing
3.08      The items proposed for Bank financing are:
US$ Million
(a) Cables and accessories for telephone
network expansion                                  13.5
(b)  Microwave equipment and accessories for
the Damascus-Aleppo-LItakia-Raqqa systems           2.7
(c) Microwave/UHF, multipLex equipment and
accessories for twelve spur routes                  4.8
(d) Rural network materials consisting mainly of poles,
wires, carrier equipment and accessories            4.3
(e)  Unallocated                                         2.7
Total           28.0
Procurement
3.09      All equipment and materials financed by the Bank loan would be
subject to international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for Procurement. A :15% preference or the prevailing customs
duty whichever is lower will be applied to bids from local manufacturers
in respect of rural network materials under international competitive bidding.



- 10 -
For items in the proJect not financed by the Bank loan, STE has already
contracted for a major part of the telephone exchange and long distance
equipment at reasonable prices. For the rest of the equipment and materials,
STE intends to call for bids or to negotiate in accordance with its pro-
curement regulations.
Ikecution of the Project
3.10      STE would prepare the specifications and bidding documents for the
cable networks, microwave/UHF radio equipment and rural network materials.
The supplier would install and commission the microwave/UHF equipment. STE
would lay and joint the cables and install the subscriber facilities. In
the case of the telephone switching equipment not financed by the Bank, the
suppliers would supervise installation by STE's personnel. The civil works,
buildings, access roads and major duct routes to be financed by STE would be
carried out by local contractors under STE's supervision. STE's Director of
Projects would monitor the execution of the Bank-financed project and these
arrangements are satisfactory.
Disbursements
3.11      The proposed loan would be disbursed against the foreign cost of
imported equipment, materials and installation costs and 100% of ex-factory
cost, excluding sales or similar taxes for materials supplied by local manu-
facturers (para. 3.09). The estimated schedule of disbursements is at
Annex 20. To allow sufficient time for final invoices, a closing date of
June 30, 1979, is proposed. As the project is part of a continuing develop-
menit program for the telecommunications sector, it is proposed that any
unused balance be applied, after consultation with the Bank and under the
same terms and conditions, against the costs of goods and services similar
to those financed by the Bank loan.
4. JUSTI FI CATION
14.0      While the justification deals primarily with the project, which
comprises the most urgent works in the first phase (1976-78) of STE's
five-year development plan, STE's overall plan objectives and targets as
related to the demand for the various services are also dealt with in this
chapter.
Local Telephone Service
4.02      The past and expected growth of the local telephone systems is
shown in Annexes 5 and 5a. The expressed demand (working connections plus
waiting list) has been growing since 1970 at an average anmual rate of
15.9%, while actual connections have been growing at the slower rate of
10% per year; therefore, the waiting list grew at 23.6% during the 1970-74
period. As of December 31, 1974, Syria had 116,587 DELs and a waiting list
of 121,880. The total demand has been forecast over the 1975-80 period on
the basis of an average annual growth rate of about 11% (compared with
15.9% average growth since 1970) and is expected to be about 1461,800 by



3-11
December 1980. Even so, the plan will not meet the total demand, as explained
below.
4.03      The project provides for the installation of about 87,000 DELs, so
that by the end of the project iperiod, in 1978, the telephone availability
would have increased frm about 49% to 58%. STE's development plan, including
the special project, provides for the addition of 270,500 DELs during the
five-year plan period (1976-80), with the special project providing most of
these additions in the last two years. By end of 1980, about 87% of the
demand would have been net and the vaiting list would be reduced to about
59,000.
4 04      A study of STE's waiting list related to the new connections made
during the fourth quarter of 19'74 revealed that the average waiting time for
each connection was about 6.8 years for Damascus City and 7.6 years for
Aleppo. About 9,750 applicants (17.7% of the waiting list) in Damascus City
and 6,910 (31%) in Aleppo had been waiting for more than nine years. In the
smaller exchange areas the average waiting time for a connection is generally
shorter. However, there is considerable unrecorded demand and pressure for
expansion into new exchange areas. STE's development plan will improve the
position on waiting time for neiw connections at the end of the project period
in 1978, but only by the end of the plan period in 1980 will the waiting time
be reduced to less than two years of application.
TlePhone Service in Rural Areas
4..05     The low rural telephone density Of 0.20 per 100 population (para. 2.04)
highlights the need for developmrent in the rural areas, especially in view of
the importance of agriculture to the Syrian economy. During the project period
(1976-78) STE expects to connect about 540 villages presently without telephone
facilities and about 12,000 addi.tional marnal subscribers in the rural areas.
This will satisfy the expressed demand in the rural areas. At the end of the
plan period in 1980, with th, total addition of 800 villages with access, the
network will cover moBt of the relatively larger villages not previously served
by the telephone system (para. 2.10).
Long Distance Telephone Service
4.06      Major improvements in speed of connection and quality of long
distance calls would be brought about by the provision in the project for
expansion of the long distance facilities through completion of (a) the
Damascus-Aleppo-Latakia-Pa2myra coaxial cable systems, (b) the Homs-Raqqa-
Deir-ez-Zor microwave systms, (c) the twelve spur UAcrowave/UHF routes
in the coasta4 northern and eastern regions, and (d) bhe installation of
automatic trunk excbanges with terminations for 2,800 circuits.  The
improvement and expansion of the network with STD service is expected to
result in a growth of 20-25% per year with stimulation of traffic of 50% on
the STD routes.  The transmissicn system has been designed to meet expected
traffic increases over the life of the systums and will be equipped to meet



- 12 -
the nornal requirements over the next few years. Additional multiplex
equipment can be added, as required, to meet later traffic increases. The
installation of the earth station and the international telephone switching
center will immensely improve the quality and speed of international tele-
phoane service.
4.07      In addition to the facilities in the project, STE's five-year plan
provides for the installation of submarine cable connections to Crete and
Alexandria and further expansion of the satellite conmmication system and
the, national and international trunk exchanges.  These additional works, to
be executed in the second phase of the plan period (1979-80), are designed
to meet the increased traffic resulting from execution of the special project
of 200,000 lines. They will also provide alternative routings in some of
the most imp6rtant sections.
Te2ex Service
4.C8      This service was first provided in Damascus in 1969 with a manual
exchange of 30 lines and was replaced in 1974 with an automatic exchange
which has a capacity of 250 lines. During 1976, new telex exchanges will be
brought into service in Aleppo, Homs and other main centers (Annex 15),
bringing the total to about 1,100 lines in the country. These exchanges are
expected to meet the demand through 1978. STE has planned a further expansion
of about 1,800 lines to meet requirements by the end of the plan period. At
present the telex service is used primarily for the international traffic
from Damascus, but with the extension of the service to other centers the
domestic traffic will become significant. The proposals are based on an
annual subscriber growth of 40% and an international traffic growth of 35%.
This is in line with experience elsewhere.
Least Cost Solution
4.09      Fundamental decisions determining Syria's telecommunications
structure were taken in 1970 in connection with the introduction of sub-
scriber trunk dialing (STD).  These incorporated numbering, switching and
transmission plans which are satisfactory. The facilities to be provided
under the project reflect a continuation of these policy decisions. The size,
design and timing of the additions to the telephone switching facilities
included in the project represent the least cost solution. The size and
tixing of the extension of the associated cable distribution network are based
on general plant practices for achieving least cost.
4.10      In the long distance sector, replacement of the microwave equipment
for the Damascus-Aleppo-Latakia-Raqqa route is necessary as it is obsolete
and has exceeded its useful life. In providing the replacement system, STE
wiLl achieve the least cost solution by using existing sites, buildings and
towi3rs as well as common equipment. For other domestic long distance routes
in the project, coaxial cable was chosen for the Damascus-Aleppo-Latakia-
Palbyra route to provide increased capacity and to serve intermediate points.
For the Hons-Raqqa-Deir-ez-Zor-Hassake-route, microwave was correctly
chosen over coaxial cable as the least cost solution. For the twelve spur

routes in the coastal, northern and eastern regions, STE has agreed during
negotiations to submit to the Bank for review the alternatives of UHF or
microwave systems for the various links to determine the least cost solution.
Return on Investment
4.11      The internal return on the project, defined as the discount rate
which equalizes the stream of expected revenues (including effects of tariff
increase) pertaining to the project with the attributable capital and
operating cost (excluding taxes, duties and contingencies), is 20.6% (Annex 21).
This rate of return is satisfactory. A sensitivity analysis shows that under
the most unfavorable combination of main parameters -- 10% increase in capital
and operating cost and 10% decriease in revenues -- the rate of return would be
not less than 14.7%. The rates of return suggest that on average the price that
the telephone subscribers are required to pay for service is considerably in
excess of the long-run marginal costs.
4.12      The economic return is undoubtedly higher because (a) the prices
charged do not adequately measure the full benefits to the subscribers,
primarily business, industry and agriculture; (b) there are external benefits
which accrue to parties other tfhan those who pay directly for the use of the
facilities; and (c) the costs include the full cost of extending service to
new areas and providing high-capacity systems even though the full benefits
will be obtained in the future when additional lines or circuits are connected.
5. THE BORROWER
Organization and Management
5.01      By Decree No. 1935 dated July 10, 1975, the Posts and Telecommuni-
cations Establishment (PTE) was dissolved and STE created as a separate
public establishment. STE is governed by Law No. 18, which provides it with
day-to-day autonomy in operations and enables it to function as a commercial
entity. However, Government will continue to approve tariffs and investments,
as well as provide major financial support, and has to be consulted on all
important matters of policy. STE is governed by a Board, with its chief
executive designated as Director General. He is appointed by Presidential
Decree. The Board is composed of the Director General as Chairman and five
heads of STE's departments and a representative of the workers as members.
The Board members are appointed by the Minister of Communications.  The
Board is empowered to set policies and regulations and to propose tariffs.
STE's annual development plan and annual operating budget need approval by
the Board and the Minister of Communications.  The accounts of STE require
acceptance by a special Board meeting which is the equivalent of a general
shareholders' meeting, with representatives from the Central Board of
Control and Inspection and the Central Board of Financial Control partici-
pating.

5.02     #While STE has existed as an independent entity since July 1975,
the telecommunication service was a well established branch of the PTE
establishment for many years. The Director General of STE is a highly capable
manager and experienced telecommunication engineer. STE's technical and
management staff are competent and have been serving in the organization for
long periods. Some improvements in organization particularly in coordination
of execution of the special project is required with the heavy expansion
program. STE's present organizational structure is shown in Annex 22
(Chart WB-15522). During negotiation STE indicated that its organization at
headtquarters and regions is under review and agreed to provide the Bank wth
details of the new structure by August 31, 1976 for comments.
Staff and Training
5.01      During negotiations STE indicated that the separation of
the postal and telecommunications staff was completed in early 1976
and the number of staff taken over by STE numbered about 4l,600,
which gives a ratio of about 28 per 1,000 telephones. This is reasonable.
STE expects to gradually decrease this ratio in the coming years. A statement
indicating the existing staff categories and numbers and the estimated
increases in the 1976-80 period is at Annex 23.
5.04      STE has a telecommunications school housed in its headquarters
bui'Lding in Damascus which trains technicians and skilled workers.  This
school, with branches for both posts and telecommunications, was established
by Decree in 1962.  The technicians are trained in two stages.  For the
fir.st stage, about 75 candidates yearly are recruited from the intermediate
grade schools and trained for two years with periods of practical training
intorposed; thereafter they become junior technicians.  For the second stage,
about 45 candidates yearly are selected from experienced junior technicians
and trained for a further period of two years; thereafter they become senior
technicians specializing in transmission, switching and networks. In addi-
tiorn to the regular courses for junior and senior technicians, STE arranges
for vocational training of jointers, equipment attendants, mechanics, etc.,
and for refresher co-urses as required.
5.05      Engineers recruited from universities are given orientation and
on-the-job training and, when appropriate, sent abroad for advanced training
with other entities and manufacturers. STE also makes use of fellowships
offered by other Governments and through UNIDP.
5.06      STE is constructing a new building for a new telecommunications
training school with an associated instituite for higher training. Assistance
from the UNDP through ITU and several governments is expected for the pro-
vision of equipment, experts and fellowships.  STE is aware that its large
expansion program requires a systematic manpower recruitment and training
program.  STE put forward an outline of a plar driLng negotiations which was
found acceptable.  STE has agreed +o de-elop this program further for dis-
cussion with the Bank before Deceuber 31, 1976 and thereafter implement that
proeTam.

Accounting and Audit
5.07      The Posts and Telecomnunications Establishment, with the assistance
of a Swiss expert, introduced a commercial accounting sytem on an accrual
basis in 1963. The accounts code on a numerical basis allows for the separ-
ation of postal and telecommmnication operations, thus providing separate
financial results for operations. The accounting system and its organization
are satisfactory and the system is functioning smoothly.
5.08      Although the accountinag staff are adequately qualified and com-
petent, the senior staff would lbenefit from some exposure to accounting and
financial management methods used by telecommunication organizations in
other countries. During negotiations, STE agreed to make suitable arrange-
ments for this purpose.
5.09      Following separation of the postal and telecommunications entities
in July 1975 (para. 5.01), with effect from January 1, 1976, the
finances of STE are to be fully separated from those of the postal establish-
ment. This will require STE to establish an opening balance sheet as of that
date, which should also reflect Government's decision on STE's capitalization
(Annex 26, Section B, para. 9). A commission has already been set up to work
out the necessary details. During negotiations it was agreed that STE will
provide the Bank with a certifiegd copy of the opening balance sheet by
July 1, 1976.
5.10      Billing and collection procedures are adequate.  While the billing
process in the Damascus Provincei is computerized, billing in the other pro-
vinces is on a manual basis. However, STE has already taken steps to com-
pletely computerize all billing operations and centralize them at its
Damascus headquarters. This is satisfactory.
5.11      STE's accounting procedures include a provision for both pre- and
post-audit. The pre-audit is carried out by STE's internal audit staff and
the post-audit on an annual basis by the General Audit Department, the
state agency responsible for auditing all state enterprises. The latter
audit is slow. So far, the audit of STE's 1972 accounts has not yet been
completed. During negotiations it was agreed that STE will have its accounts
annually audited, starting from 1976, by independent auditors acceptable to
the Bank and that certified financial statements together with the auditors'
report will be submitted to the Bank not later than five months after the
end of each fiscal year.
Insurance
5.12      Except for motor vehicles, STE has not made any provision for
insurance against losses on fixed assets such as from fire and theft. The
cost of this type of insurance is very high and STE's management feels that
the wide geographical spread of its assets provides reasonable dispersion
of risk. Moreover, being a public establishment, STE would be assisted by
Government if serious losses occur. This is in line with the approach
adopted by many State-owned teliecommunications entities; hence, STE's
policy of not carrying insurance on its fixed assets other than motor
vehicles is acceptable.

fayments to Government
5.13      Apart from paying customs duties on imported equipment ranging from
22,5 to 35% of the value of such imports, STE is limited by Decree No. 1935
to retain 25% of its profits each year. In addition, in accordance with
Law No. 18, STE may keep its revenues to the extent that they are required to
cover STE's operating and maintenance expenses and finance its investments
under Government approved expansion plans; STE has to transfer to Government
that portion of revenues which exceeds these requirements. In order to enable
STE to make a reasonable contribution towards financing the large expansion
program, it was agreed during negotiations that Government will enable STE
to retain out of its annual revenues such amounts as shall be necessary (a)
to provide reasonable working capital, (b) to cover appropriate maintenance
ancd renewal of its facilities and (c) to finance the investments required
for the expansion of its telecommunications services.
Tariffs
5.14      STE's tariffs, which require Government approval, have remained
essentially unchanged since 1972. A summary of STE's tariffs is given in
Annex 24. The basic features include a deposit before receiving service
ranging from LS 150 to LS 200 (US$40 - 54); installation charges of LS 500
(US$135) for automatic subscribers and LS 300 - 400 (US$80 - 108) for manual
subscribers; an annual rental (no local call charges) of IS 72 (US$19.50)
for subscribers connected to manual exchanges; an annual rental of LS 120
(US$32.40) including 1,000 free local calls per year for subscribers con-
nected to automatic exchanges. The charge for a local call exceeding the
l,COO free calls is LS 0.10 (2.7 US cents). The charge to all subscribers
for long distance calls is LS 0.75 (20 US cents) per 100 km call distance
for each three-minute conversation. These rates are lower than those of
similar entities, which is further indicated by the low annual average
revenue of about LS 406 (US$110) per subscriber.  The corresponding revenues
(in US$) for countries at a similar stage of development are as follows:
Egypt    Iraq    Ghana    Pakistan    Ethiopia    India
150      162      211        224          236        253
5.15      Although the low level of tariffs has been adequate to permit
moderate telecommunications expansion in the past, it would not sustain
STE's financial viability during the new expansion period. Government is
aware of the need to raise tariffs to enable STE to make a reasonable con-
tribution toward financing the large expansion and to fully cover its debt
service requirements. In this connectlon, STE has proposed to raise rentals
and call charges for automatic subscribers by 50% and to reduce the present
1,000 free calls.  STE also proposes to increase the installation charge
for new automatic subscribers from the present LS 500 to LS 1,000.  These
proposals are based on studies undertake-n by STE over the past three years
and are designed to provide adequate reve-lues.  The proposals are satis-
factoiry and if implemented woull resu.t i-n an overall increase in STE's
telephone revenues of about 40%, whi-h is sufficient to meet its future
financing requirements (para. 6.10).



- 17 -
5.16      STE expects that the proposed tariff revisions will cae into
effect by October 1, 1976. Revenue forecasts for this report are based on
this assumption. During negotiations it was agreed that STE will increase
its telephone tariffs to produce annually at least 40% additional telephone
revenues as from October 1, 1976 ats compared with revenues under current tariffs.
6. FINANCES
Background
6.01      Before separation of the postal and telecommunications entities
in July 1975 (para. 5,.01), the telecommunications operations were financially
viable (para. 6.02) but the postal, operations were unprofitable. Previous
telecommunication expansion prograxs were of moderate size (about 15% growth
annually) and were almost entirelyfinanced from the entity's own resources;
hence the debt/equity ratio at end of 1974 was very low -- 3/97. The
expansion during the 1976-78 period will increase net plant in service from
LS 150.9 million to LS 654.5 million, a more than fourfold increase. In
order to meet the financing requirements (para. 6.10), STE will have to take
up substantial borrowings (Annex 26, Section B, para. 11) and also con-
siderably increase its internal cash generation. It is estimated that with
the tariff increase (para. 5A16), internally generated funds including sub-
scriber deposits would contribute, net of debt service, 27% of total require-
ments; 73% of STE's financing requirements would be covered by external
borrowings and Government funds. Forecasts indicate that STE's earnings
position during the project period would be satisfactory.
Past Financial Performance
6.02      Income statements for STE's past telecommunications operations
during 1970-74 are shown in Annex 25. Related notes are in Annex 26,
Section A. A suimlary is given below:

Expenses              21,755  23,085  26,915  29,778  35,185

Operating ratio (%)    66       66      72       72      57
6.03      The above results are satisfactory.  The heavy increase in revenues
in 1974 by about 50% over 1973 and the resulting high rate of return were
caused mainly by changes in the billing process in that subscribers were
billed in 1973 for only three quarters and in 1974 five quarters were
accounted for. Under normal conditions, the rate of return in 1974 would have
been about 18%.

6.05      The gross value of plant in service is based on original cost.
Since the major part of the plant has been acquired during the past five
years and the obsolete plant is retired when its assessed lifetime ends, the
present gross value is reasonably realistic. Moreover, any errors in the
past values of gross assets would become insignificant by the end of the
project period, when the value of gross assets would be nearly four times
the 1974 figure.
6.o6      As of December 31, 1974, accumulated depreciation amounted to
about 46% of the value of gross plant in service at that date. This is
high but justifiable in view of STE's strict depreciation policies
(para. 6.05) under which depreciation is computed for each class of plant
on a straight-line basis. The composite rate is about 5%, which is reason-
able.
6.07      The current ratio (excluding inventories) was 2.2, which is satis-
factory. Among the items of current assets, the value of inventories ranked
first and amounted to LS 29.8 (US$8.0) million. Although a small part of
total assets, the holdings are high in view of the moderate size of the
telecommunications network. Inspection of some stores showed that there are
many items still included which are either obsolete or unlikely to be util-
ized. This situation needs attention and it was agreed during negotiations
that STE will from time-to-time consult with the Bank on the adequacy of its
write-off policy with respect to the accounting of its inventories.



- 19 -
6.08      As of December 31, 1974, accounts receivable amounted to LS 16.4
million, of which IS 3.2 million (20%) was owed by private subscribers and
IS 13.2 million (80%) by Government subscribers. Whereas private subscribers
generally settle their bills on time and their outstandings in fact repre-
sented less than one month's billings, the collection of Government accounts
has been poor. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that in the
future all Government subscribers will pay their current billings promptly
when due.
6.09      As of December 31, 197h, subscriber deposits represented 4% of
STEts capitalization. Because these deposits are repayable only if sub-
scribers give up service -- and if they do, others will replace then --
deposits are not considered as constituting long-term debt. On this basis
STE's debt/equity ratio was 3/97 on December 31, 1974. This ratio is very
low and is explained by the fact that past expansion was mainly self-financed
and only to a minor extent was financed by medium-term suppliers' credits.
Financing Plan
6.10      Annex 28 shows the annLal sources and applications of funds during
the past period 1973-74 and the forecast period 1975-80. On the basis Of
these forecasts, which assume STE's future tariff revision (para. 5.16) and
retention of its revenues as required (para. 513), the capital investment
and working capital requirements during the project period 1976-78, along
with the sources from which they would be met, are summarized below.

6.11    The above financing plan estimates that internal cash generation,
inc:Luding subscribers, depo dits, would contribute (net of debt service) about
27% of total requirements for all purposes. This is acceptable in view of
the large capital expansion during the project period.
6.12    Borrowings would cover 55% and equity contributions from Government
would contribute 18% of total requirements. Details are as follows:
(a) LS 106.3 (US$28.7) million would come from balances of secured
suppliers' credits.
lib) LS 107.1 (US$28.9) million is expected to come from additional
suppliers' credits. STE provided the Bank with the final details,
terms and oonditions of these credits during negotiations and
confirsed the availability of these credits.
(c)  LS 108.0 (US$29.2) Million would be for STE's special project,
for which disbursements are assumed to commence in 1977. This
amount for the special project would form part of a bilateral loan
from either the Federal Republic of Germany or Japan. Government
has already received the German proposals. The likely terms of
this loan would be for 20 years, including a grace period of
five years, and an interest rate of 2*%. These terms have also
been assumed for the purpose of this report.
(d)  The proposed Bank loan of US$28.0 (LS 103.6) million is assumed
to be made for a term of 20 years, including a four-year grace
period, with an interest rate of 8%.
(e)  The balance of funds not covered by internal cash generation and
external borrowings would be of the order of LS 136.0 (US$36.8)
million. During negotiations it was agreed that Government's
contributions towards financing of STE's investment program will
be in the form of equity.
6.13    The financing plan for the project period, which takes into account
the tariff increases as from October 1976 (para. 5.16) and also disbursements
for STE's special project (para. 6.12), is satisfactory. If STE's special
project should be delayed for one to two years, which is possible, this
would not only substantially iMprove the above financing plan but also would
- reduce the amount of funds which Government is required to contribute during
the project period.
Future Finances
6.14      Forecast income statements and balance sheets for 1975, the project
period 1976-78 and thereafter up to 1980 are given in Annexes 25 and 27;
related notes are in Annex 26. The main features of the forecast accounts
are given below.

Debt service coverage        7.4      6.o      7.0      3.0     3.5        3.8
6.15      Operating revenues are projected to increase in proportion to the
growth in subscribers and as a result of increased trunk revenues after the
installation of adequate long distance facilities. The revenue projections
also reflect proposed tariff increases in 1976 (para. 5.16). Expense projec-
tions reflect wage and other operating cost increases experienced in the past,
adjusted for the anticipated higher staffing levels and the overall increase
of the network. As a result, the average annual growth rate of revenues
during the 1976-80 period would be about 35% and the corresponding growth rate
of expenses about 30% thus resulting in satisfactory operating ratios.
6.16      DLie to substantial borrowings required for financing STE's expansion,
the debt/equity ratio will change from 5/95 at December 31, 1975, to 46/54
December 31, 1978. Thereafter it -Ls expected that the ratio would gradually
decrease due to substantial repayments of debt. Despite STE's future substan-
tial debt service requirements resulting from the above borrowings, internal
cash generation would cover annual debt service at least 3 times throughout the
forecast period 1975-80. In view of the satisfactory debt service ratio, the
debt/equity ratio is acceptable. ]However, to help ensure STE's future viability,
agreement was reached during negotiations that STE will not contract long-term
debt unless the preceding 12 months' net revenues will cover the maximum futture
debt service at least 1.5 times.
6.17      With the proposed tariff increases (para. 5.16) and the initially
slow increase of the assets base duaring the project period., it is estimated
that the rate of return would be about 16.7% at the end of the first project
year. Thereafter, as STE's major expansion adds rapidly to its assets, the
rate of return would drop to 12.8% in 1978, the last year of the project
period, and would be 13.8% in 1979 and 13.5% in 1980. Thus, a rate of return
on net assets of not less than 11% is considered to be a reasonable minimum
level which could provide funds for capital servicing and for self-financing
of a reasonable proportion of construction requirements. During negotiations,
agreement was reached to maintain tariffs at a level sufficient to produce an
annual rate of return of not less than 11% on the average net fixed assets
reasonably valued.
6.18      On the basis of tentative forecasts, itAis expected that STE will
oontinue to be financially viable after the 1976-80 program period.
6.19      Indicators that will help to monitor STE's performance are given
in Annex 29.

SYRIA
SYRIAN TELECOMMUNICATION ESTABLISHMENT (STE)
Ecisting Facilities
LDcal Telephone Services
1.        At the end of 1974, Syria had about 116,600 direct exchange lines
(DELs) and 152,450 telephones.  The registered waiting list was about
1:21,880 out of which about 55,070 were in Damascus and 22,400 in Aleppo,
the two major cities in the country. The total number of telephone exchanges
in the country was 114 out of which 17 were automatic and the rest were
manual. The total capacity of automatic telephone exchanges in the country
o0n December 31, 1974, was about 140,200 lines and consists of 7 D Rotary
systems manufactured by BTM of Belgium and Budavox of Hungary with later
installations of the EMD system from Siemens, Germany.  The distribution of
the exchanges by location is given in the statement in Annex 11. The manual
exchanges in the country have a total capacity of about 15,000 lines. These
are mostly magneto type and a substantial number have been assembled in Syria
by a company licensed by LM Ericssons of Sweden. The subscribers' sets are
also assembled by a local factory.
2.        The outside plant network consists of underground cables, using
abestos cement ducts and cables drawn through these ducts in the center of
main cities.  Outside of these areas, armored cables are laid directly in the
ground with use of self supporting aerial cables in some areas.  Cabinets are
fairly widely used to provide flexibility between primary and secondary cables.
The distribution for subscribers is mostly by means of drop wire and in some
areas by open wire lines. The junction cables and main primary cables in
Damascus and Aleppo are kept under gas pressure to prevent water ingress and
facilitate detection of leaks and repairs.  Ilue to extensive construction in
the major cities, damage to cables is frequent in spite of coordination with
murnicipal authorities and other utilities.
Long flLstance Services
3.        Long distance facilities between the main cities is provided by
midcrowave or coaxial cables with open wire carrier systems being used to
connect minor centers in the rest of the country. Details are shown in
Map IBRD - 12015R. The main microwave network connects Damascus with Homs
and Aleppo with spurs to Latakia, Raqqa, and Hama. This network was installed
in 1966 and in certain sections, such as Homs, Shaikh Dahir, and Aleppo,
the distances between stations are too long for satisfactory propagation
and affect the quality of transmission. Besides STE has found it difficult
to obtain spares for this system which is obsolete.  STE is proposing
therefore to replace the equipment and redesign the system to meet ITU
standards. A two tube 1.2/4.4 mm coaxial cable system connects Damascus with
Daraa in the south.  The main open wire routes cross Syria from north to
south and across the northern and eastern parts. Subscriber trunk dialing

service is available to a limited extent in the country. At present STD
service is available between Damascus, Dera, Zabedani, Homs and Hama, and
also between Raqqa and Deir-ez-Zor and Hassake. The service from Latakia
towards Damascus is in one direction only. Its introduction on a wider
scale is held up due to lack of circuits in adequate number and quality
(see Annex 16) also. Toll ticketing has been adopted for recording and
charging long distance calls.
International Services
Syria has both coaxial and microwave links to Lebanon which pro-
vide good quality circuits. However, due to non-completion of the trunk
switching center in Damascus there are delays in establishing connections.
A two-tube 1.2/4.4 mm coaxial cable links Damascus with Amman (Jordan).
As a temporary measure, Syria uses the earth station facilities in Jordan
and Lebanon to work directly withL USA, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrein.
Syria has also circuits via Lebanon for connection to Egypt and Europe by
means of submarine cables (Beirut-Alexandria-Italy). In addition, Syria
is connected by open wire carrier systems with Turkey and Iraq and HF radio
circuits with Cuba and Peoples Republic of China.
Telegraphs and Telex Services
The major centers in Syria are provided with teleprinters for
the public telegraph service. Other cities are equipped with manual Morse
circuits. Telegrams are also transmitted by telephone from many villages
where there is an STE operated telephone exchange.  The manual telex
exchange in operation since 1970 was replaced by a new telex exchange
which was installed in Damascus :in August 1974 and handles international
telex traffic at present. The installation of telex at other centers had
been held up due to lack of circuits between the centers (see Annex 15).

The following analysis covers a period of 20 years after commissioning;
a period related to the composite depreciation rate of 5%.
2. Net Benefits
Capital expenditures and operating costs under the project exclude
taxes, duties and contingencies. Revenues and operating cost reasonably
associated with the project were derived from the forecast income state-
ments for the period 1976-79 (Annex 25).
A summary of project related cost, revenues and net benefits at con-
stant 1975 prices (In LS millions) is given below:
Capital     Operating                       Net
Year              Cost          Cost       Revenues      Benefits

1977             129.2          11.0          34.6        (105.6)
1978             146.2          19.0          59.5         (105.7)
1979-1997          -            33.7         119.0  -       85.3
3. Rate of Return
On the basis of the above data the internal return on the project,
defined as the discount rate which equalizes the stream of net benefits
as above, i8 20.6%.
4. Sensitivity Analysis

Rate of Return
(i) 20% increase in capital cost                            16.8%
(ii) 20% increase in operating cost                          18.7%
(iii) 10% decrease in revenues                                17.4%
(iv) 10% increase in capital and operating cost and
10% decrease in revenues                                 14.7%

ANNEX 26
Page 1 of 5 pages
SDRIA
SYRIAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS ESTABLISHKENT (STE)
Notes and Assumptions on Financial Statements
A. Income Statements (Annex 25)
Background
1.  The former Postal and Telecommunications Establishment's income
statements showed the results of t]heir postal and telecommunications opera-
tions as a whole. On the basis of its account code which allows fairly
well for the separation of the above operations, income statements for the
period 1970-74 have been adjusted to show the results of the telecommunica-
tions operations only. However, to allow for a link to the balance sheets
for that period, the annual deficit of the postal operations has been
included in the statements under the heading "Net Other Income."
2. The forecast of revenues is based on STE's existing tariffs.
However, as from 1976, additional telephone revenues which would result
from STE's overall increas of their tariffs by about 40%, are separately
shown under the heading "Revenues From Rate Changes."
Telephone Revenues
3. Installation charges were forecast to reflect the planned average
increase in connections.
4. Rentals were forecast on the basis of the annual average of con-
nected subscribers.
5. Local call charges apply to automatic subscribers only and repre-
sent charges for calls in excess of the 1,000 free calls each subscriber is
entitled to make under the present tariff. Revenues were projected on the
assumption that the annual revenues from excess calls per subscriber would
gradually drop from about LS 100 in 1975, 1976 and 1977 to about LS 70 in
1980, thus reflecting the increasing access of the subscribers to the long
distance network.
6. Trunk calls are forecast to produce revenues at the historical
annual growth rate of 20% during 1975 and 1976. In line with the gradual
expansion of the network and the completion of the major long distance
facilities, the annual growth rate is expected to arrive at 50% in 1978
due to an impulse jump caused by the substantial increase in the STD service.
Thereafter it would gradually decline and reach the historical level of 20%
in 1980.
7. International calls would generate revenues at the historical
annual growth rate of 15% during 1L975-77. In 1978 when the satellite earth
station would be in full operation, the growth rate would increase to 30%.
Thereafter revenues are assumed to annually increase by 20%.



ARNEM 26
Page 2 of 5 pages
8. Telegraph revenues are assumed to annually decrease by 2%, thus
reflecting the increasing availability of telephone and telex services.
9. Telex revenues were forecast to annually reflect the expected
average number of telex subscribers and the increase in traffic.
10. Miscellaneous revenues are assumed to annually increase in accord-
ance with the average growth of DELs.
Expenses
11. Staff cost was assumed to increase by 20% in 1975 to provide for
higher salaries and pension payments. Thereafter staff cost was assumed to
annually increase by 25%.
12. Operating and maintenance expenses were forecast to annually
increase by 2 percentage points below the average growth of DELs, thus
asuaming that future operations would provide for cost reductions due to
economies of scale.
13.  Depreciation was forecast at an annual c,oaposite rate of 5%.
14. Miscellaneous expenses were forecast to annually increase in
accordance with the average growth of DELs.
B. Balance Sheets (Annex 27)
Background
1. While the former Posts and Telecommunications Establishment's
accounts code would allow for showing separately the financial position of
the Establishment's postal and telecommunications branches, the annual
balance sheets so far account for the financial position of these branches
as a whole. For the purpose of this report, the actuals shown in the bal-
ance sheets for the period 1970-74 have been adjusted to show the financial
position of the telecommunications branch only. The adjustments are neces-
sarily of a tentative nature and could include some inaccuracies which,
however, would not substantially impair the presentation of the past finan-
cial position of the telecomiunications branch.
Plant in Service
2. Values of total plant additions for the years 1975 through 1980
are based on STE's program. The depreciation reserve was computed for each
year's addition based on a 5% straightline depreciation rate.
Work in Progress
3. The values for plant under construction pertaining to the Rank-
assisted project were assumed to equal 40% of the annual capital construc-
tion plus the balance of works brought forward from previous years.



ANNEX 26
Page 3 of 5 pages
Cash and Bank
4. Forecast cash balances are derived from the Sources and Applica-
tions of Funds statement and are assumed to amount to two ronths' cash oper-
ating expenses.
Accounts Receivable
5. Due to the reorganization of the billing process in 1975, accounts
receivable were forecast to annually equal about three months' billings in
1976 and thereafter would gradually decrease to two months' billings in 1980.
Inventories
6. Present inventories are too high and the forecasts assumed that
inventories would gradually decline from the present LS 241 per subscriber
to LS 148 per subscriber in 1980.
Prepayments
7. Prepayments for the years 1975 through 1977 represent payments to
be made to suppliers on the signing of contracts. Prepayments for the years
1978 through 1980 were assumed to annually amount to LS 9 million.
Equity
8. STE's opening balance sheet has not yet been established. The
forecasts, therefore, assume that its future capitalization would be on the
pattern of the former Posts and 'Telecommunications Establishment (PTE) where
equity consisted of capital, reserves and surplus of the year.
9. For the years 1975 through 1977 STE was assumed to retain the
statutory capital of the former IPTE which almost entirely represents previ-
ous investment by Government for PTE's telecommunications branch. STE's
full statutory capital of LS 300 million was assumed to be fully paid up
