TULI BLOCK ROADS PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrowert         The Republic of Botswana
Beneficiarys      Ministry of Works, Transport and Communications (MWTC),
Roads Department (RD)
Amount:           US$14.9 million
Terms:            Seventeen ylars, including a five-year grace period, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate.
Project
Obiectives:       The main objectives-of-the project are to (a) provide road
links necessary for the deyelopment and integration of the
Selebi-Phikwe'area and its hinterland, and facilitate its
effectiveness as a regional marketing center; (b) strengthen
the capacity of RD to organize and carry out road
maintenance at the increased level mandated by the expansion
of the road network; and (c) impro=ve road planning and
progravuing capability in anticipation of the next National
Development Plan (NDP7) in 1991.
Project
Descriptions      The project will comprise the followings
(a)   construction of th.-Sefophe-Martin's Drift road, 134
--  - --= -      km, to bitumen standard, including a 10-km spur tC- the
-      major village of Kgagodi, and village access roads;
(b)   construction of the Bobonong-Lekkerpoet road, 66 km,
of which about 50 km will be to bitumen standard and
the 4emainder with a gravel surface, including two
-I short access roads to the villages of Molalata4 and
Mathatbane; and
(c)   consulting services fors  (i) construction supervision
for (a) and (b) above; and (ii) a study of a new
maintenance management/organization system for roads,
combined with a network planning study.
Justification
and Riskst        Substantial benefits are expected to accrue from the
reduction in transport costs with consequent favorable
effects on-production and marketing costs in the region.
The project is expected to facilitate the development and
diversification of the regional-economy by improving the
accessibility of Selebi-Phikwe both within the region and
with respect to national and external markets.  By opening



up ap area consisting of rural farms and villages and by
providing better access to a game reserve, the project also
will lay the groundwork for increased agricultural and
livestock production and tourism in the area. The economic
rate of return for the project is estimated to be 15
percent. The principal risk is that full realization of
ag-icultural benefits associated with the Bobonong-
Lekkerpoet road may not occur without improved horticultural
marketing and supply management.  To reduce this risk, the
Government has agreed to prepare and take steps to
facilitate implementation of an agricultural development
plan for the district.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. BACRGROUND AND REGIONAL CONTEXT
A. Geographic and Macroeconomic Setting
1.01      Botsvana is a large landlocked country in southern Africa,
bordered by Namibia, the Republic of South Africa (RSA), Zambia aud
Zimbabwe. With an area of 582,000 km2 (about the size of France) and
population of 1.21 mi;lion, it is for the most part sparsely populated.
Two-thirds of the;country is covered by the Kalahari 1/ Desert and over 80
percent of the population is concentrated in the relatively fertile eastern
third.  The population has been growing rapidly at a rate of 3.52 per annum
(1980-87), but populatiog density remains low, about 2 persons per km2,
compared with the average for middle income Sub-Saharan Africa of 65.
1.02      Botswana has experienced impressive economic growth over the
past two decades, with average real GDP growth of 10 percent per annum
during the 19709 and 11 percent per annum during the 19806. Consistent
with this high growth, per capita income has risen from US$110 in- 1970 to
US$1,490 in 1988. Although impressive, most of this growth has been the
,resgt of gains in the production of-mi'nals and, to a legser extent, the
export of beef and? output from a small industrial and comercial sector.
From 1976 to 1948, the share of GDP attributable to mining and quarrying
increased from 13 to 44 percent, while agriculture's share declined from 23
to 3 percent.
1.03      Largely a result of increased mineral royalties and dividends,
government revenue grew 220 percent, from 763 million pula in 1984/85 to
2,446 million pula in 1988/89.  Over the same period, capital expenditures
increased about 280 percent, from 210 to 791 million pula, and recurrent
expenditures about 160 percent, from 342 to 897 million pula. The last
overall budgetary deficit was in 1982183. Since then, prudent management,
plus the surge In revenue due to strong diamond sales and prices, has
caused the budgetary surplus to grow as much as 300 percent from 188
million pula in 1984185 to 771 million pula in 1988189. However, as much
of this growth was due to the selling off of stockpiled diamonds and higher
than expected prices in the world market, this high rate of growth is not
expected to continue. Current forecasts indicate that the growth of the
economy will decelerate in the years ahead, with a commensurate reduction
in the rate of growth of government revenue.
1.04      While the government budget and balance of payments remain in
surplus, government spending has increased twice as fast as forecast in the
11 The Botswana name is Kgalagadi.



-2-
current National Development Plan, 1985-1991, (NDP6). Government
development spending increased nearly 50 percent in each of the past three
years, partly in response to the greater than anticipated availability of
real resources and partly to fulfill a continuing need for drought-related
expenditures. The Government's 1987 Mid-term Review of NDP6 reported
development expenditures of the Ministry of Works, TZansport and
Commuications (MWTC) 63 percent above the level projected in NDP6 for the
1985-87 period. Nonetheless, the surplus of the government budget has
exceeded 15 percent of GDP in recent years, and foreign reserves reached.a
high of U$$2 billion in 1988, enough to cover about 18 months of imports or
equivaleut to approximately one year of GDP. These reserves have been
professionally managed and Botswana's financial rating is souad. However,
while the presence of large foreign reserves reflects the Government's
fiscal restraint, it also is symptomatic of the lack of depth in the
economy and consequent inability to absorb the large resource gains as
rapidly as they hate accumulated.
1.05      Botswana's impressive growth masks its pronounced economic
dualism. Two-thirds of the population continues to reside in rural areas
and to depend on traditional agriculture and cattle-raising. Overall, the
rural economy has been in decline, both in relative and absolute terms.
Although partly a result of the recent drought, poverty and unemployment
are major issues likely to become more problematic as population pressures
increase, ocological damage sustained in the arable and range lands worsens
before mitigating programs can take effect, and other constraints to future
growth becowe more severe. The unemployment rate is currently about 25
percent and most evident in urban areas and major villages. This is likely
to grow as approximately 20,000 people enter the labor market each year,
compared with formal sector job creation of 11,000-14,000 per year.
1.06      The dichotomy between rapid economic growth on the one hand and
high unemployment and rural decline on the other represents the difficulty - - -
of progressing beyond prudent fiscal management to economic development
that is broadly based and sustainable. Botswana's economy is very
undiversified, and entrepreneurial skills are generally lacking in a
society that until recently relied on raising livestock for earning incomes
and as a mechanism for saving. Some positive signs of diversification are
evident, as manufacturing has grown about 8 percent per annum over five
years, albeit from a sutall base, rising from 4 percent to 6 percent of
domestic output. Total non-mining industrial and non-government service
sector value added has grown approximately 7 percent per annum and now
represents nearly 40 percent of GDP. However, much of the demand
motivating growth in the service sector is linked to the mining sector and
would be eroded if mineral revenues were to fall.
1.07      The major challenge, then, is to use the resources available
from diamond exports to promote sustainable economic growth. The
Government's policy, reflected in NDP6, is to use these resources to
diversify the economy and thereby promote productive employment, especially
outside of the capital-intensive mining enclaves. However, a recent Bank
study concluded that the volume of investment required is sufficiently
large to exceed-even Botswana's apparently ample domestic resources. Given
the small size of the economy, a successful program would need to be
export-driven and depend on foreign investment to provide not only



-3-
financing but also expertise and access through established marketing
relationships to world markets. Botswana's reputation for strong economic
management places it in a relatively good position for such development.
B. Focus on Regional Development
1.08      While economic diversification is a national priority, there is
particular urgency in Selebi-Phikwe, a town with a population of about
40,000 that depends heavily on a copper/nickel mine which shows a
progressive deoline in the level of production. In anticlpation of a
gradual reduct on in ou'cput, the Government has given priority to finding
ways to reduce Gependence on the mine and diversify economic activity in
the area. The Selebi-Phikwe/Tuli Block region also is of strategic
importance because it is a relatively fertile area along the Limpopo river
with access to markets in Zimbabwe and R0A as well as Botswana's main
population centers. The town of Selebi-Phikwe, with its substantial water
resources, also is important as it offers an alternative growth pole to the
water-scarce and increasingly congested capital, Gaborone.
1.09      Thus, although Selebi-Phikwe's initial development was
determined by the presence of minerals, the town has a number of other
locational advantages. Even daring prolonged periods of drought it has
er-joyed adequate water supply; recharge of the nearby Shashe Dam has proved
ample, and the town is close to the Limpopo River and its major tributavy,
the Motloutse. Immediately to the east is the Tuli Block, and to the west
is a triangle of semi-urban villages - Serowe, Palapye and Mahalapye - that
lacks much of the modern sector activity Selebi-Phikwe is capable of
generating. These villages and other settlements bring the total
population of the region to nearly 200,000, about 15 percent of the
country's total population. Selebi-Phikwe's only potential competitor as a
developing regional center is the larger commercial and manufacturing
center of Francietown, about 160 km_to the north. However. tuere is a
difference in oriettation, as Francistown looks more to trade with Zimbabwe
and serving Botswana's cattle industry through its rail facilities and
abattoir.
1.10      In spite of Selebi-Phikve's locational advantages, it did not
initially develop as a regional center. In part this was because the
town's economic activity was centered on the mine and there was little
integration with other activities in the region. These other activities,
primarily dryland farming and traditional livestock herding, had little use
for the services of a regional center but relied instead on smaller
villages and Botswana Agricultural Marketing Board (BAMB) depots. The town
itself was relatively inaccessible from the rural areas, as communication
links and services within the region, quch as roads, electricity and
telephone connections, were poor or unavailable.
1.11      These circumstances are now changing, due in part to the
activities of the Selebi-Phikwe Regional Development Unit (SPRDU)
established under the Selebi-Phikwe Technical Assistance Project (Ln. 2695-
BT) and to the momentum of investment in a range of activities in the area.
To date, SPRDU's industrial promotion program has brought six manufacturing
enterprlses into the area.  Although not yet fully operational, these firms
are expected to create 1,100 new jobs. Another four firms are expected;to



-4-
begin operation in 1990, potentially creating another 500 jobs.  To assist
this effort, the Government has designated industrial investment in Selebi-
Phikwe as a favored category under the national Financial Assistance Polic,
(YAP), which includes the provision of tax holidays, favorable interest
rates, seed capital for investors uid payroll and training grants. An
added incentive was recently approved for industrial or manufacturing firms
locating In Selebi-Phikwe, but only if they employ 400 or more Batswana and
export 100 percent of output outside of the southern Africa region
(Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADOC) and Southern
Africt7n Customs UVhoi (SACU) areas). In addition to the standard PAP
provisions, such firms would be eligible for a nominal corporate tax rate
of 15 percent for _0 years and exemption of withholding taxes on dividends
paid from after-tax profits for the first ten years.
1.12        As part of the long-term agricultural development of the
region, feasibility studies are well advanced for the construction of up to
three dams in the Shashe Basin that will, among other purposes, provide
water for irrigated agriculture as well as urban water supply. SPRDU also
has a modest program to assist small-scale irrigated agriculture in Selebe-
Phikwe and environs O*madinaire and Tobane) and Bobonong to the east in the
Tuli Block. In the Tuli Block area, recent improvements to
telecommunications, extension of the electricity supply grid, and iv -,ved
road access will significantly reduce constraints to development.  La
addition to area residents served by these investments, Talana Farm, a
comercial irrigated farm located in the Tuli Block area, is likely to be
an important beneficiary.
C.  Rationale for Bank Grouyp-Involvement   - -
1.13      The Bank's involvement in Selebi-Phikwe dates back to 1969, 1971
and 1974 with the financing of water, rail and housing infrastructure (Cr.
172-BT, US$2.8 million; Ln. 776-BT, US$32.0 million; and Ln. 776-2-BT,
US$5.5 million). A loan to the Botswana Development Corporation in 1974
(Ln. 1019-BT, US$4.0 million) also included sub-loans for Talana Farm
(US$0.1 million) and for covmercial property development in Selebi-Phikwe
(US$1.0 million). More recently, the Bank has been instrumental through
the Selebi-Phikwe Technical Assistance Project (Ln. 2695-BT, US$7.6
million) in generating national and international interest in the region
and in facilitating a coordinated approach to its development.
1.14      The present project is a natural continuatIon of the Bank's
support directed towards eliminating the major constraints to the area's
emerging economic attraction to investors and a necessary element in the
long-run strategy to transform a mining town that would not remain viable
in the absence of minerzl activity into an industrial and agricultural
center. The Bank's participation will help to ensure the coordination and
timely implementation of these investments and realize the ensuing
developmental benefits. The project also will build on previous Bank
involvement in the road subsector by strengthening the planning and
maintenance capability of the Roads Department (RD).



II. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. The Transport System
2.01      Consistent with the development pattern that has emerged in
Botswana, the surface transport system is concentrated in the eastern
corridor. Botswana Railways (SR) runs north-south through this corridor
and connects to thk South African Railways and National Railways of
Zimbabwe (NRZ). The road system also I.s more developed in the eastern
portion, with the main north-south roa%l running parallel to the railway
line. However, the Government has embarked on a program to extend and
upgrade the network, Including completion of the Nata-Maun-Ghanzi sections
of the circular main road and the Sekoma-rhanzi-Mamuno road to Namibia, as
well as continue to upgrade rural roads to promote rural development. The
civil aviation system is extensive and reflects the importance of air
transport in a vast, sparsely settled country. Air Botswana, the naticnal
carrier, provides scheduled service to the main airports of Gaborone,
Francistown, Selebi-Phikwe and Maun, the first three of which are located
in the eastern corridor, as well as service throughout the southern Africa
region.
Roads
2.03      Botswana's present road network consists of 8,204 km of gaWetted
roads (2,360 km paved and 790 km gravel) and about 8,000 km of ungazetted
roads and tracks.  The quality of the main roads generally is good, but
most of the roads in rural and remote areas are heavy sand and earth tracks
and only passable with four-wheel drive vehicles. Notwithstanding the
relatively sparse network of roads, road transport plays an important role
in the economy. More-udetails on the road subsector are provided in Chapter
III.-
Railways
2.04      The railway system consists of the north-south main line (641
km) that links Bulawayo in Zimbabwe through Botswana with Hafeking in RSA,
and two branch lines, one running from Serule to Selebi-Phikwe (59 km) and
one from Palapye to Morupule (15 km). A branch line connecting Sua Pan to
the main lins at Francistown (180 km) for the extraction of soda ash, salt
and associated minerals is under conStruction and scheduled for completion
in April 1991.
2.05      Until recently, the main line wr.s owned by NRZ but operated by
BR, while the branch lines were owned and operated by BR. BR took over
operation of the entire system in 1987, with transfer of ownership one year
later. A track improvement program is under way and additional assets,
such as rolling stock, signalling and telecommunications, are being
procured in order to improve operations. Additional managerial and
technical staff have "een added to supplement the NR2 personnel taken over
in the course of the transfer. Although a strong emphasis has been placed
on the training of Batswana to cover all BR requirements, expatriate staff
continue to fill most key managerial posts.



-6-
2.06      A railways traffic and tariff study vas completed in November
1988, which recommends a new system of cost-based tariffs set to recover
full costs. This would replace the existing tariff structure, which
reflects traditional value of service pricing, plus a surcharge applied to
branch line rates to cover the costs of those lines. In addition to
distortionary effects, the existing structure has resulted in poor cost
recovery overall. BR showed a deficit of nearly 9 million pula in 1987188
and an estimated 8.5 million pula in 1988189. There also was the concern
that the surcharge on the Selebi-Phikwe line provided a disincentive for
the development and diversification of economic activity in that area. The
Government plans to adopt the new tariff structure in 1991.
2.07      The railway has increased in importance over the past decade
because of the traffic generated by mineral development and beef exports.
The railway carries a large share of imports and most bulky exports for
Botswana, and is used by Zimbabwe, Zambia and Zaire as a transit route to
and from RSA ports. Transit traffic accounted for 40 percent of total
freight traffic of 2.08 million tons in 1987/88 and 2.07 million tons in
1988189. Although the north-south road runs parallel to the main rail
line, the nature of the freight traffic (weight and bulk) is such that
there is little road-rail competition for freight haulage in the corridor.
An estimated 500,000 passengers used the railway in 1988/89.
Civil Aviation
2.08      Air transport plays an important role in the transport system of
Botswana due to the long distances between settlements and inadequacy of
the road network in some parts of the country. This is reflected in
Botswana's many airports and airstrips, which include one international
airport in Gaborone, three regional airports (Francistown, Selebi-Phikwe
and Maun), 30 secondary and minor airstrips, and 122 private licensed
airstrips. The main airports are constructed to bitumen/concrete standard,
while the minor airstrips range from gravel to sand. These are used
extensively for private, commercial and tourist flights and help to
integrate settlements in the north and west into the economic and social
life of the country.
2.09      For the period 183-58, passenger volumes at the four main
airports (Gaborone, Francistown, Selebi-Phikwe and Maun) increased by 62
percent, from 113,437 to 184,365. Domestic traffic accounted for 68
percent of the growth, with a more than doubling of domestic volumes in
Maun but 50 percent reduction in Selebi-Phikwe. Althouph international
passenger volumes have increased, the decline in Selebe-Phikwe's domestic
traffic began with the improvement of the north-south road, placing the
town within a reasonable driving range of Gaborone. Cargo traffic handled
during the same period increased by 90 percent, from 278,449 kg to an
estimated 529,200 kg, and mail traffic grew by about 70 percent, from
92,695 kg to an estimated 157,050 kg.
2.10      Air Botswana was initially established in 1972 as a profit-
oriented parastatal wholly owned by the Botswana Development Corporation
(BDC). The airline consistently incurred substantial losses and in 1988
became a parastatal under the supervision of MWTC. The airline presently



-7-
operates four aircrafts a Dornier 228, two ATR 42s, and a recently
acquired BAe 146. Passenger traffic grew 25 percent over the past year,
exceeding expectations, and load factors improved from 41 to 51 percent.
In FY 1989, the airline showed a small net profit before tax, but this was
prior to delivery of the new aircraft. Although the objective of economic
viability remains, supported by strong traffic growth and a recent tariff
increase, the necessity of Government assistance is expected to continue
for some time.
B. Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
2.11      The Botswana National Transport Plan, completed in 1983, forms
the basis for Government policy and planning in the sector through the year
2000. The main objectives of the Plan are to reduce the country's high
transport costs, improve transport services in rural areas, increase
economic benefits derived from transit traffic and, where feasible, reduce
dependence on the transport services of neighboring countries. The Plan's
recommendations are reflected in NDP6 and a Mid-term Review completed in
1988. Now that the foundation of the basic transport network is largely in
place, specific objectives of NDP6 are to:
1)   focus on maintenance as the first priority and restrict new
construction to what the Government can afford to maintain;
2) improve access to rural areas, especially areas with
agricultural potential or opportunities for productive
employment;
3)   introduce a Pavement Management System to facilitate
monitoring of maintenance needs and improve planning;
4)   revise taxation and pricing policies to improve the overall
level of cost recovery in the sector; and
5)   continue the manpower development program and indigenize
posts where suitably trained and experienced candidates are
available.
2.12      The key issue that underlies these objectives is the ongoing
need to review basic priorities, within and among sectors, in anticipation
of a reduction in the current high rate of economic growth. The pacing of
development will become increasingly important, both because fewer
Government resources are likely to be available and because the next phase
of capital development projects in the road subsector includes costly
projects such as the trans-Kalahari highway traversing sparsely populated
areas to the west. With respect to sustainability, the accelerated pace of
the development effort over the past few years will greatly increase the
recurrent budget and skilled and semi-skilled manpower requirements in the
coming years. These are all issues that will be addressed in the course of
planning for NDP7, 1991-1997.
2.13      The Government's overall priorities among sectors are reflected
in the five-year public sector investment program. Annual investments in
transport over the past five years are shown in the following table:

2.14      Total investments in transport more than tripled over the five
year period, 1984/85 to 1988/89, while total Government development
spending approximately doubled. Road expenditures continued to rise, but
the largest inctsease was in railways. The peak in civil aviation in
1986187 reflects the construction of Sir Seretse Rhama Airport and the rise
In railway expenditure BR's takeover of the main rail line from NRZ in
1988.
2.15      Planned public investments in transport are shown in Table 2.2
.-below. Investments in transport, particularly the road sector, are shown
to increase dramatically during the remainder of the NDP6 period, even
without inclusion of the trans-Kalahari road.  This reflects the
Government's plan to upgrade the road network and provide better access to
rural areas.

2.16      Two ministries play a role in the development of the transpoit
sector. The Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP) is
responsible for overall investment planning, while the KWTC is responsible
for the development anid coordination of all modes of transport. Consistent
with the Government's decentralized approach to planning, most ministries
have established planning units. The Planning, Research and Statistics
t'nit within KWTC has the job of preparing and evaluating the development
program and specific projects for inclusion in the NDPs.
C.  Bank's Role in the TransDort Sector
2.17      The Bank has assisted Botswana's transport development through
five loans and credits totalling US$48.4 million. The First Road Project
(Cr. 63-BEC, US$3.6 million), approved in 1964, provided for the design,
construction and reconstruction of 570 km of roads, upgrading of sections
of the north-south road, and expansion of the maintenance organization.
The Second Road Project (Cr. 303-BT, US$2.0 million), approved in 1972,
included reconstruction and paving of 80 km of the north-south road,
detailed engineering and supervision of additional roads, and technical
assistance to the Roads Department. The Third Road Project (Ln. 1174-BT,
US$5.8 million), approved in 1975, provided for construction of 52 km of
roads, further consulting services, support for the Roads Training Center
(RTC), preparation of a road maintenance program for main roads and a pilot
maintenance program for district roads. Continued support for the
implementation of these programs was included in the Fourth Road Project
(Ln. 1408-BT, US$20.0 million), approved in 1977, which financed further
construction, supervision and detailed engineering, and special studies for
roads linking the Tuli Block farm areas to the main network and feed?r
roads needed to support agricultural development. The Fifth Road Project



- 10 -
(Loan 1941-BT, US$27.0 million), approved in 1981, included paving of an
extension of the north-south road to Zimbabwe, improved access to portions
of the Tuli Block and adjacent areas, and further strengthening of RD
though construction of a Soils and Materials Testing Laboratory and road
maintenance depots. In addition, the Bank loan for the Shashe
Infrastructure Project (Ln. 776-BT) included construction of the Serule-
Selebi-Phikwe road (52 km) for a cost of US$3.5 million. The Selebi-Phikwe
Technical Assistance Project (Ln. 2695-BT) provided funds for the
engineering design of the two roads in this project.
2.18      Implementation of these projects has been satisfactory.
Although some delays have occurred, the work has been completed and of good
quality. The economic rates of return of the first three road projects
were on average below appraisal estimates, with the first (5? actual vs.
15Z estimated) because of quarantine restrictions that depressed trucking
demand, the second (131 actual vs. 19Z estimated) because of delays in RSA
cross-border roads, and the third (12? actual vs. 17? estimated) because
traffic growth slowed more than anticipated. Economic returns of the
subsequent two road projects were considerably higher than expected (27?
vs. 181, and 26? vs. 13?, respectively). The roads have generally been
well maintained.
2.19      Most Bank lending to Botswsa in the sector has concentrated on
financing the physical works and equipment needed to improve RD's
operations and training. Bilateral aid agencies have assumed
responsibility for staffing and training instructors, usually on a low cost
or concessionary basis. Significant progress has been made in the training
of'RD technicians, but indigenization of posts for technical officers and
engineers has been slow due to the shortage of candidates suitable for
further training. During recent years there has been a shift in the Bank's
strategy away from provision of infrastructure to providing support for
human resource development, land use planning, urban policy reform,
regional development, and economic diversification and employment creation.
The project will provide infrastructure in support of the Government's
program to promote growth and diversific.tion of the economic base of
Selebi-Phikwe and its hinterland, and continue the Bank's previous support
in the road subsector of improved planning and management capability.
III. THE ROAD SUBSECTOR
A. The Road Network
3.01      At independence in 1966, Botswana had a gazetted road network of
about 5,000 km, only 10 km of which were paved. Since then development of
the road network has occurred at a rapid pace, and the network now totals
8,204 km of officially gazetted roads and 8,000 km of ungazetted roads and
tracks (Table 3.1). About 29 percent of the gazetted roads are paved, 10
percent are gravel, and 61 percent are earth or sand. Most of the paved
roads are located in the eastern portion of the country, increasingly to
the north, e.g., in the vicinity of Maun, with plans under way for



- 11 -
upgrading the network in the vest and south (para 2.01). Maintenance of
the gazetted road network is satisfactory.

1989           2,360             790          5,054                8,204
*Ungazetted network is estimated to be 8,000 km, all earth and sand.
Sources Roads Department, 1989.
3.02      With a surface area of 582,000 kz2, the country has an average
road density of 0.033 km per km2. The coverage of the network is adequate
for the country's present needs, but most of the roads in rural or remote
areas remain unimproved. The ungazetted rural roads, which comprise nearly
50 percent of the total length of all roads, are very poor and often
impassable or washed away during the rainy season. Road construction and
maintenance are difficult throughout most of Botswana, as a large portion
of the country is semi-desert-with poor sandy soils, and suitable stone and
gravel are scarce. In such cases there is a need to upgrade segments of
the road network even in rural areas and to establish an organizational
structure and capability to maintain these roads to a satisfactory standard
(para 4.10).
B. Road Use
3.03      The private vehicle fleet has grown from just over 8,000
vehicles in 1973 to over 55,000 by 1988, 40 percent of which are registered
in Gaborone (Fiture 3.1). The latter figure includes nearly 10,000 new
registrations, of which approximately 40 percent were cars, 30 percent
light delivery vehicles, and 10 percent lorries. Reflecting Botswana's
economic growth, the vehicle density has risen from 33 per thousand
residents in 1981 to 55 in 1987.

3.04      Regular traffic counts are conducted at least quarterly at about
45 locations on the gazetted road network. Traffic statistics are compiled
annually and show that traffic is increasing rapidly, on the order of 10
percent per annum over the past five years'and as much as 14 percent from
1987 to 1988. Much of the growth continues to be in the southeast, where
traffic volumes grew nearly 20 percent during 1987-1988, Aompared with less
than 10 percent in the north and a slight decline in the est.  However, as
these points only capture a portion of the traffic on the expanding road
network, these statistics most likely underestimate the actual growth in
motor vehicle use throughout the country.
3.05      This traffic growth has been accompanied by a significant
increase in the number of road accidents, with the number of road accidents
reported in police records tripling between 1981 and 1988 (Figure 3.2).
Phase 2 of a Road Safety Improvement Project, started in 1988, is presently
in the implementation phase. Under this project, a reorganization in MWTC
increased staff and strengthened the road safety sector, vehicle inspectors
and traffic police were trained, reflective tags were distributed to people
in four main centers in the country, and a major public information
campaign it under way. The accuracy of accident statistics should improve
considerably with the initiation of a new Accident Information System in
1988. Of the 5,000 accidents entered into the new system for 1988, 3
percent were fatal, 10 percent serious, 21 percent minor and 66 percent
involved damage of vehicles only. Thirty-eight percent of all accidents
Qccurred in the Gaborone area, reflecting the concentration of vehicles in
that area, and Government vehicles throughout Botswana were found to be
involved in accidents twice as often as other vehicles. In 1988 the
fatality rate, persons killed per 1,000 vehicles, was 3.8, among the lowest

3.06      The Transpbrt Control Division of MWTC is responsible for the
regulation of: road transport, including implementation of the Road
Transport (Permits) Act (1973), which covers the regulation of passenger
transport and haulage, and the Road Traffic Act, which covers registration
and licensing of motor vehicles, drivers, and road safety. 'Under the Road
Transport (Permits) Act, permits are required for goods vehicles Rsed for
hire, for own account if a vehicle's carrying capacity exceeds three tons,
and for'all vehicles providing passenger service for hire. P'ermits are
awarded upon receipt of an application plus, in the case of for hire
service, a public hearing. Short term permits of up tb 3 months in
duration 'can be granted without a public hearing. Permit holders must leep
their vehicles in serviceable condition and keep appropriate records.
Additional conditions may be attached, including restrictions on the route
or area in which the vehicles may operate. Freight tariffs are not
regulated,'but passenger fares are determined by the Transport Advisory
Board and have a rigid structure.
3.07      Ovet the past five years the number of licensed goods vehicles
has averaged about 1,500 for-hire and 1,000 own-account vehicles.
Approximately 50 percent of the licensed vehicles in both categories are
foreign-owned, most based/in RSA and, to a lesser extent, in Zimbabwe. Of
the locally licensed vehicles, approximately 45 percent of for-hire and 65
percent of own-account are registered to small operators with one or two
vehicles. During this same period, the number of permits issued for
passenger vehicles (taxis, mini-buses and buses) nearly doubled from about
800 to over 1500.
C.  Sector Finances

3.08      Road users contribute to Government revenues through-taxes and
duties on vehicles, fuel, lubricants and spire parts, and through license--



- 14 -
and vehicle registration fees. Fees from licensing, registration and road
transport permits, as well as sales taxes on petrol and diesel, are set and
collected by the Government. All other taxes and duties on goods imported
into SACU countries are paid into a common revenue pool; these are
distributed according to an agreed revenue-sharing formula and are
equivalent in effect to a 17 percent levy on all imports.
3.09      As indicated in Fiaure 3.3, the revenue from road user charges
has been inadequate to cover road maintenance expenditures. (A breakdown
of road transport revenue by source and expenditures (maintenance,
construction and rehabilitation) is included in Annex 2.) In 1988189, road
user charges covered only about two-thirds of total maintenance
expenditures, even including the significantly greater receipts from higher
fuel taxes (10 thebe (US$0.05)/liter on diesel and 13 thebe (US$0.07)/liter
on petrol) implemented the previous year. Even with these higher taxes,
the pump price of fuel remains below that of some countries in the region,
including Malawi and, for petrol, Zimbabwe. At the time of appraisal, the
pump price per liter of petrol and diesel in Botswana was 86 thebe
(US$0.46) and 70 thebe (US$0.37), respectively (10 or 12 thebe more in the
north), compared with US$0.68 and US$0.59 in Malawi; US$0.51 (87:13
petroltethanol blend) and US$0.28 in Zimbabwe; and US$0.37 and US$0.26 in
Zambia.

3.1Q      The-last two years shown in Figure 3.3 indicate that the deficit
between road revenues and expenditures is expected to increase over time.
Accordingly, the Government has adopted a new system of road transport
permit fees, axle load violation penalties and surcharges for abnormal
loads to replace the existing fee schedule which dates back to 1976. The
new fee schedule, adopted this year and reflected in the road transport



_ 15 -
license receipts forecast for 1990/91, establishes fees for transit traffic
(movement of goods that neither originate from nor are destined to
Botswana) and for single trip permits at levels approaching the cost of
damage done to roads by particular weight categories of vehicles. Fees for
Botswana freight traffic (movement of goods originating from or destined to
Botswana) were set at levels below cost in order to encourage citizen
participation in the road haulage industry. Permits for buses and taxis
were kept low for the same reason.
3.11      However, in view of the present concern that the growth of
revenues from the mining sector will taper off over time (para 1.03), the
Government has adopted the general principle that user charges in each of
the transport subsectors should be set in a manner that will cover marginal
costs at a minimum and make a contribution towards meeting full costs
wherever possible. In the road subsector, the recent increase in permit
fees and fuel taxes represents an important first step in this direction.
To continue this progress, a more comprehensive restructuring of road user
fees has been proposed for implementation i.n two stages. The first would
provide for recovery of the full maintenance and road replacement cost
associated with transit traffic, and variable maintenance cost for domestic
traffic (estimated to be 85Z of full maintenance cost). The second would
extend this to recovery of full maintenance and road replacement cost for
all traffic. As before, the recovery methods would include vehicle
registration and permit fees, levies and duties on fuel, and duties on
vehicles and spare parts. The Government intends to implement these
stages, subject to the requisite legislation being passed in a timely
manner, by June 1991 and June 1993, respectively. Agreement was reached
during negotiations that the Government would continue to implement its
plan for this comprehensive restructuring of road user fees.
D.  Administration, Staffing and Planning        -
3.12      HWTC (Chart 1) and the Ministry of Local Government and Lands
(MLGL) share responsibility for the construction and maintenance of the
country's roads. RD (Chart 2) under MWTC executes works on the national
road=uetwork, which includes all gazetted roads. The other-public roads in
district and municipal areas are the responsibility of district conacils
and town councils under MLGL. RD offers technical assistance on an ad hoc
basis to the councils in their work.
3.13      The main objective of RD is to provide adequate road
communications infrastructure within the country as well as with
neighboring countries. RD is responsible for formulating road development
programs, which are subsequently submitted to MFDP for inter-sectoral
coordination, approval and funding. RD has six branches for specific
functionst (1) Development, (2) Maintenance, (3) Direct Labor, (4)
MaterLals and Research, (5) Roads Training Center (RTC), and (6) Department
Management. The first five branches are headed by Principal Roads
Engineers and the sixth by a Principal Administration Officer. RD's
headquarters is in Gaborone and the country has been!divided into three
regions for maintenance purposes with regional offices in Francistown,
Gaborone and Maun.



- 16 -
3.14      The staffing of RD has expanded rapidly over the last several
years. The present number of professional and technical staff is about 180
plus about 70 staff for general administration. In addition, about 1,600
laborers are employed. At the management level in the professional field,
RD is staffed for the most part by expatriates financed by a number of
bilateral aid agencies. However, compared to ten years ago when only one
Batswana was in position out of a total of fourteen professional engineers.
some progress has been made in localizing RD. The number of engineering
positions has increased to 33 of which 10 are now filled with Batswana and
13 with expatriates.  RD expects to recruit more local engineers in the
near future and is also considering engineers from other countries in the
region (Zimbabwe and Zambia). The salary level for RD engineers, although
not on a par with the private sector in Botswana, is sufficiently
attractive that recruitment from neighboring countries is not difficult.
For technical officers, the situation has greatly improved. Ten years ago,
only 4 out of 25 positions were held by Batswana, whereas at present 72
positions out of 83 are filled with Batewana, with only 5 expatriates left.
According to RD's plans, almost full localization will be accomplished by
1992.
3.15      The training of highway engineering technicians, road
super7isors and equipment operators is carried out by RTC. The objectives
of RTC are to train both employees within RD and new potential candidates
from secondary schools and elsewhere, in order to improve the skills and
efficiency of its staff. Localization of expatriate posts in RD has been
another objective, now largely fulfilled. RTC offers a 3-year diploma
course for highway engineering technicians, a 2-year road supervisor
course, and a 7 to 9-week equipment operator course held a number of times
throughout the year. Since 1986, RTC has also been responsible for
training staff of the district councils in labor-intensive techniques.
Road Planning
3.16      Road projects are selected and evaluated by MWTC's Planning Unit
in close cooperation with the Development Branch of RD. The Planning Unit
initiatls, prepare:s and monitors MWTC's development projects in accordance
with planned objectives as rcntained in the NDP (para 2.16).  The
Development Branch is responsible for detailed road planning, feasibility
and other pre-investment studies, coordination of research work and traffic
engineering. The National Transport Study,- completed in 19u5, evaluated a
large number of projects and identified over 30 worthwhile road sections,
listed in order of priority, for implementation over a ten-year period to
1996. Many of these projects have been completed and five large projects
are currently under construction. The list of priority roads is reviewed
and-updated on a regular basis, but RD recognizes the need for an in-depth,
systematic study of the entire road network, including district roads. The
study's objectives are to reclassify roads, identify viable road projects,
reorganize maintenance arrangements, and optimize the use of manpower and
funds allocated for these activities. The project includes a road -
investment and maintenance study with the above objectives (para 4.10).

EnMineerIng
3.17      The Design Section of RD's Development Branch is responsible for
all design aspects of the gasetted roads.  Consultants are usually hired
for major projects with the Design Section being responsible for monitoring
the consultants' woik and liaison with the consultants on all matters
concerning the design and contract documentation. Geometric design
parameters have been standardized (under a consultant study financed under
the Fifth Road Project, Ln. 1941-BT) and published in the Botswana Road
Design Manual. Materials investigations, testing and research services to
all government departments are undertaken by the Materials and Research
Branch of RD. The Branch also monitors materials specifications of ongoing
construction works being supervised by consultants for RD. The offices and
laboratories of the Materials and Research Branch are housed in a separate
laboratory building constructed under the Fifth Road Project.
Construction
3.18      Most major road works are carried out by foreign contractors.
Contracts are let after competitive bidding based on priced bills of
quantities and are supervised by consultants. RD has a Direct Labor Branch
for force account work, which has mainly been limited to construction and
improvement of roads in remote rural areas. Three mobile construction
units are in operation, each fully equipped with its own fleet of plant and
vehicles, for which the unit has full maintenance responsibility. The
local construction ii)dustry has concentrated almost totally on building
construction, but a t4w firms now have the capacity to undertake small and
medium-size road projects, especially in urban areas under MLGL.
Maintenance
3.19      RD's Maintenance Branch is responsible for routine and periodic
maintenance of all gazetted roads. In addition, the Branch is responsible
for road signs and markings, and control of axle loading through six
permanent weighbridges. Most of the periodic maintenance work, that is,
resealing and regravelling, is carried out by local contractors through
competitive bidding procedures with some of this work being carried out by
units from the Branch. The plant and vehicles used by RD staff for
maintenance and other activities, except for the Direct Labor Branch, are
allocated from the Central Transport Organization (CTO), a department of
MWTC. This organization is responsible for both the purchase and repair of
all the equipment. There are several CTO depots around the country where
vehicles may be filled up with gasoline and be repaired and serviced. The
MNintenance Branch has several of its own workshops with mechanics seconded
from CTO.
3.20      While RD has built up a well-functionIng Maintenance Branch and
the gazetted road network is in generally good condition, the maintenance
of district and town roads under MLGL has become a problem. The district
councils' road-maintenance units are under-equipped and have difficulty
maintaining their roads adequately, especially in areas where population
density is very low. *At the district level, a labor-intensiveiroad and
improvement project constructs and successfully maintains a small but
grbwing uumber of district roads. However, the dramatic increase in



traffic is creating problems everywhere, both for RD and the district
councils.  The national road network and the district roads will sometimes
require similar types of maintenance, and it is doubtful whether two
parallel maintenance organizations would be the most cost-effective way of
organizing road maintenance. RD is therefore planning to have these
organizational aspects analyzed as part of the road mnvestmeait and
maintenance study under the project.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01      The main objectives of the project are tot  (a) provide road
links necessary for t-he development and integration of the Selebi-Phikwe
area and its hinterland; (b) strengthen the capacity of RD to organize and
carry out effective road maintenance at the increased level mandated by the
expansion of the road network; and (c) improve road planning and
programming capability in anticipation of the seventh NDP (NDP7) in 1991.
The project objectives are in line with the Government's strategy as
outlined in NDP6 and with the Bank's strategy in the sector.
B. Description
4.02      The project comprises the followings
(a) construction of the Sefophe-Martin's Drift road, 134 km, to
bitumen standard, including a 10-km spur road to the major
village of Kgagodi, and village access roads;
(b) construction of the Bobonong-Lekkerpoet road, 66 km, of which
about 50 km will he to bitumen standard and the remainder with a
gravel surface, including two short access roads to the villages
of Molalatau and Mathatbane; and
(c) consulting services fort
(i) construction supervision for (a) and (b) above; and
(ii) a study of a new maintenance management/organization system
for roads, combined with a network planning study.
Construction of Sefophe-Martin's Drift Road
4.03      Feasibility studies carried out in 1984 and 1986 of the road
system in the Tuli Block region identified the Selebi Phikwe-Martin's Drift
road as the most important link in the future road network serving the
area. The first 25-km,section of the road from Selebi Phikwe to Sefophe
was upgraded to bituminous standard in 1983 under the Fifth Highway
Project. From Sefophe to the south through the project area and to the
vest, the existing roads are improved earth and gravel.  In the rain;
season these roads frequently become impassable and two major rivars in the



' 19 _
project area, the Tshokana and the Lotsane, present a major break in road
communication. The new road will continue south from Sefophe but, instead
of taking the direct route to Martin's Drift, will curve westward in a new
alignment in order to serve a number of large villages, including the
district administrative center of Maunatlala. The large village of Kgagodi
located to the west of the proposed alignment will be linked to the main
road through a 10-km long spur road. In addition, short access roads will
be provided 'o other villages along the alignment. About 19 km from
Martin's Drift, the new road will join the existing gravel road from
Palapye to Martin's Drift and follow it for the rest of the way to Martin's
Drift. The project location is shown on the map (IBRD No. 22255).
4.04      The new road is estimated to carry close to 200 vehicles per day
in the opening year. It will be constructed with a 6-m carriageway with a
bituminous surface treatment and with 1-m shoulders, also provided with a
bituminous surface. The design parameters (Table 4.1) are in accordance
with the Potswana Road Design Manual for a Type 4 road; however, the
shoulder width has been reduced from 1.5 m and the savings will be used to
seal the shoulders zo reduce future maintenance cost. The two crossings at
Tshokana and Lotsane rivers will be spanned by reinforced bridges of total
length of 43 m and 54 m, respectively.

Construction of Bobonong-Lekkerpoet Road
4.05      Another road identified in the feasibility studies (para 4.03)
as an important link for upgrading to bitumen standard is the road linking
the district subcenter of Bobonong to the farming area of Lekkerpoet in the
Tuli Block. The road will serve two large villages, Mololatau and
Mathathane, along the proposed alignment as well as the farm of Talana,
also in the Tuli Block, and the Mashatu game reserve close to the
confluence of the Limpopo and Shashe rivers. The existing road is a
district road from Bobonong to Mathathane with a 4 m wide gravel surface.
The road was constructed in 1980 and reconstructed in 1986 but has since
thep received little maintenance and is now in poor condition.



- 20 -
Furthermore, numerous river crossings, including two major ones at the
Thune and Selepswe rivers, are encountered, but as no provision for
culverts and bridges has been made, the road becomes virtually impassable
in the wet season; even in the dry season the road is difficult to pass
except in four-wheel drive vehicles. From Mathathane to Lekkerpoet, where
the project road will linlk up with the existing 'Frontline Road" (an
improved gravel road running parallel with the Limpopo river at a distance
of about 1 to 5 km from it), there is currently no effective road
communication, limited access being Pvailable over ill-defined tracks and
only negotiable for travellers with local knowledge and four-wheel drive
vehicles.
4.06      The project road is estimated to  arry about 75 vehicles per day
in the opening year on the 50-km section t tween Bobonong and Mathathane.
Beyond Mathathane the projected traffic drops to about 20 vehicles per day.
A detailed pavement materials survey has shown that there is a scarcity of
suitable gravel materials for pavement constri tion in the area (as
virtually everywhere in Botswana); deposits of calcrete materials only have
been located and long hauls would be required. Extensive research has been
carried out in Botswana regarding the use of calcrete for base courses on
asphalt roads and wearing courses on gravel roads. If the traffic exceeds
about 50 to 60 vehicles per day, it is usually advantageous to provide a
bituminous seal to prevent the rapid deterioration and the high maintenance
costs that would otherwise occur.
4.07      The new road has therefore been designed as a Type 5A road
(Botswana Road Design Manual) with a 5-m carriageway with a single
bituminous surface treatment and 1-m shoulders, also sealed to prevent loss
of the calcrete materials. On the lightly trafficked section from
Mathathane to Lekkerpoet, it is expected that the calcrete can hold up
until the traffic builds up in future years. Since the design speed for a
Type SA road is the same as for a Type 4, namely 80 kmlh, the geometric
alignment design parameters for the entire length of road are the same as
indicated in Table 4.1 for the Sefophe-Martin's Drift road. The pavement
would carry fewer than 200,000 equivalent standard axles (ESA) over its 20
year design life, which indicates that a pavement of Type EO would be
adequate. Two major river bridges are included in the projects the 72-m
Thune and the 24-m Selepswe bridges, both in reinforced concrete.
Status of Prolect Preparation
4.08      RD employed UK and Zimbabwe consultants for the detailed
engineering of the Sefophe-Martin's road and the Bobonong-Lekkerpoet road,
respectively. This work was completed at the time of appraisal in November
1989. Prequalification of contractors was under way with scheduled
completion by the end of May 1990.
Consulting Services
4.09      Supervision of Construction.  Consultants will be engaged to
supervise all civil works. The Government has decided to employ the two
design consulting firms for these services, which is acceptable to the
Bank. It is estimated that about 150 man-months of consulting services
will be required for the supervision.



-21-
4.10      Road Investment and Maintenance Study.  As mentioned in para
3.16, RD is planning to have an in-depth study carried out of the overall
arrangements for maintaining the entire road network. In connection with
this work, a data base for the network will be established that will be
used as the main input for determining the optimum level of maintenance
efforts, urgrading strategy, and a phased investment program based on
priority considerations. The Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance
Standards Model (HDM3) computer program for analyzing the road investment
and maintenance strategy will be an essential tool in this work. The terms
of reference for the study are available in the project file. RD has
decided to employ consultants to assist in carrying out the study. The
manpower input is estimated at about 75 man-months.
C. ProJect Costs and Financing
Project Costs
4.11      The total project cost, including contingency allowances, is
estimated at P 70.4 million or US$37.6 million, with-a foreign exchange
cost of P 49.2 million or US$26.2 million (70? of total cost). The total
cost, net of identifiable taxes and duties, is P 63.6 million (US$34.0
million).  Details of the project cost are shown in Table 4.2.   Total cost
includes (i) physical contingencies of 102 of base cost on all items and
(ii) price contingencies amounting to 29Z of base cost plus physical
contingencies. The price escalation has been calculated based on the rates
shown belows
1989      1990      1991-1995       1996
Local cost           11.5X     8.02      4.9Z p.a.       3.72
Foreign cost        -0.41      4.9?      4.9? p.a.       3.7t
4.12      Past disbursement experience from specific investment projects
in Botswana suggests that the length of the implementation period will be
about seven years, and the price contingencies have been calculated on this
basis. The Government is, however, planning to implement the project over
a three to four year period in accordance with the target implementation
schedule (para 4.16), which would reduce the estimated cost by about 11? or
from P 70.4 million (US$37.6 million) to P 62.7 million (US$33.5 million).
4.13      Cost estimates for the road works were based on the average of
tender prices for the Mochudi-Sikwane road for which bids were received in
May 1989. This road is located in the eastern part of Botswana, and the
works and terrain are similar to those for the project roads. The cost
estimates have been updated to May 1990 by application of the above price
escalation factors. The average costs per km for the road works are as
followss
Sefophe-Martin's Drift road:  US$140,000
Bobonong-Lekkerpoet roads
asphalt:     US$93,000
gravel:     US$82,000

4.14      The cost eutimates for the consulting services for supervision
included in the project are based on recent experience in Botswana, namely,
corresponding to about 62 of the estimated cost of the road works, which is
reasonable and in line with experience from other countries in the region.
The cost estimates for the study are based on recent experience from
studies of a similar nature carried out in Botswana and neighboring
countries.
Financing
4.15      The Bank's contribution to the project is limited to 602 of the
expenditures, net of taxes, for Sefophe-Martin's Drift road, including
supervision. The Goverment has sought a loan from BADEA for financing the
Bobonong-Lekkerpoet road, including supervision, and a grant from AfDB for
financing the road investment and maintenance study. The proposed
financing plan is shown in Table 4.3.

D. Implementation and Procurement
4.16       RD will be responsible for the execution of the project.  A
target schedule (Annex 3) for project implementation is based on the
expectation that the Government would be able to award the contracts for
the road works in late 1990 so that the actual construction work can begin
in early 1991. As mentioned above, prequalification of contractors was
scheduled for completior in late May 1990, so the target schedule is
realistic. With a two-year construction period the project is scheduled
for completion in early 1993.
4.17      The Bank-financed road construction, that is, the Sefophe-
Martin's Drift road, is estimated to cost about US$26.0 (including
contingencies), and will be carried out under a unit price contract awaraed
after international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank
guidelines for procurement. The bidding documents have been reviewed by
the Bank and found satisfactory subject to some minor modifications. The
Bobononi-Lekkerpoet road works will also be carried but under a unit price

_ 24 -
contract, awarded after competitive bidding in accordance with BADEA
regulations. Consultants will be employed for supervision and the road
investment and maintenance study. For the supervision services, the
Government has decided to continue with the design consultants, and the
Bank has no objection to this arrangement. In May 1990, the Government was
in the process of finalizing the supervision contract with the consultants.
Since the contract includes assistance to RD in bid evaluation, it would
have to be made effective in July 1990, that is, prior to loan
effectiveness, and some retroactive financing for these services will be
necessary. For the road investment and maintenance study. the African
Development Bank (AfDB) will provide financing and the AfDB guidelines for
selection of consultants will apply.

Z. Disbursements
4.19     -The loan funds will be disbursed on the following basis:
(a) 55S of the total expenditures.on road works; and
(b) 552 of the total expenditures on consulting services.
All disbursements will be fully documented, except payments for contracts
totaling less that US$40,000, which will be paid under statement of
expenditures (SON). Retroactive financing of consultants' services will be
required, up to an aggregate amount of US$200,000 for expenditures incurred
before loan effectiveness, but after June 1, 1990.
4.20      The estimated schedule of disbursements of the Bank loan is
given in Table 4.5 below. This schedule is based on experience with Bank-
financed specific investment loans in Botswana. At the Government's
*request, no special account will be established for the project.

F.  Accounting, Auditing and Reporting Reqzuirements
4.21      Project accounts will be maintained by RD with separate accounts
for each component. In accordance with the country't constitution, the
Auditor General carries out an annual audit of all government accounts and
submits a report to MFDP and the National Assembly. The statutory
responsibility is discharged by carrying out test checks and examinations,
and this will be adequate for the purposes of the project. Audit reports
on the project accounts for the Bank-financed part of the project,
including a separate audit opinion for SOE, will be submitted to the Bank
not later than six months after the end of the fiscal year. At
negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on the content and
timing of quarterly progress reports and submission of the Government's
contribution to the project completion report, in a form satisfactory to
the Bank, not later than six months after the project closing date.
G. Environmental Aspects
4.22      The Botswana Road Design Manual, in its section on alignment
selection, contains instructions for preservation of national resources and
archaeological sites. In accordance with these instructions, the design
consultants for both roads employed the services of environmental and
archaeological specialists to carry out the detailed surveys of the
proposed alignments. The specialists' reports and recommendations are in
the project file.
4.23      The environmental impact assessments considered two phases,
namely, the construction period and the subsequent operational period.
Several aspects of the environment were considered for both of these
phases, such as landscape quality and geomorphology, existing physical
process (erosion, drainage, etc.), air and water quality, sound and visual
quality, fauna and flora, and historical, cultural, social and economic
factors. The recommendations for amelioration of any impact upon the
environment during the construction phase cover a number of items, such as
stripping of vegetation, storage of topsoil, protection of trees within the
road reserve, etc., all of which are adequately controlled through the
existing RD Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Works. However,
special reference is made to the fragile ecosystems associated with the
riverine vegetation encountered by the route alignments. As this
vegetation is rare, special attention has been recommended to encourage the
preservation of the sites bordering the river crossings. Other measures
have been proposed for the construction and post-construction phases, and
specific additional clauses have been included under the Special Provisions
section of the contract documents. It is estimated that these additional
clauses will not have any significant financial implication.
4.24      The archaeological surveys were carried out in parallel with the
alignment design and on several occasions the findings resulted in a shift
of the proposed alignment to avoid disturbing particular sites of
archaeological interest. Four such sites were identifled on the Sefophe-
Martin's Drift road alignment and measures have been proposed for
preservation of two of them; on the third site, a comprehensive surface
collection of artifacts was made and no further action was found necessary,



-27-
while on the last site mitigation in the form of excavation of the site
prior to construction has been proposed.  On the Bobonong-Lekkerpoet road,
25 sites of stone age, iron age and historAic interest were located, of
which two sites were proposed for preservation or at least for mitigation
(excavation) prior to the construction; two other sites should be excavated
and nine sites should be sampled before construction. Special measures
such as fencing, have been proposed to protect the sites during the
construction phase. Again, these measures are judged to involve only
modest expenditures. Furthermore, at negotiations the Government agreed --
that the road alignment would be moved if archaeological sites being
sampled are shown to be valuable and require costly mitigating measures.
In concl..ion, the care taken during the initial alignment survey to avoid
archaeological sites and to make the'relevant authority, in most cases the
National Museum of Botswana, aware of the presence of sites of importance
has proven to be worthwhile.
V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A.  General
5.01      Under successive NDPs, Botswana has upgraded and expanded its
basic road network and strengthened its road administration. Now that the
basic network is in place, NDP6 specifically targets rural areas and
provision of infrastructure to facilitate specific development goals. With
respect to transport, the plan stresses the need to improve access to areas
with agricultural potential or opportunities for productive employment
(para 2.11).
5.02      The project supports these objectives by providing
infrastructure necessary for the successful expansion and diversification
of the economic base of Selebi-Phikwe and its hinterland. The Sefophe-
Martin's Drift road was designed to improve access to Selebi-Phikwe for a
range of development and marketing purposes, both providing direct access
between the major markets of the Johannesburg-Witwatersrand industrial
complex and Selebi-Phikwe and routing traffic originating from or destined
to the north through Selebi-Phikwe. The Bobonong-Lekkerpoet feeder road
will open up an area consisting of rural farms and villages and one large
scale irrigated farm for further agricultural development, as weli as
improve access to a game lodge currently easily accessible by road only
from RSA. The improvement and extension of this road will afford the rural
population better access to markets, supplies and public services.
5.03      Construction of the two roads is expected to yield a combined
sconomic rate of return (ERR) of 15X, with individual ERRs as follows:           -
ERR
Sefophe-Martin's Drift                     16
Bobonong-Lekkerpoet                        12



- 28 -
No ERR has been calculated for the maintenance management system, which
will improve the organizational structure for road maintenance and help RD
meet the maintenance challenge of a rapidly expanding road network.
B. Economic Evaluation
5.04      The economic justification of the two roads is based on an
assessment of the economic costs and benefits with and without the project
over the estimated economic life of the roads. However, each road's
economic rationale differs in some respects, as the roads will serve
different functions and benefit different groups within the area. For the
Sefophe-Martin's Drift road, a main road providing a more direct route
between activity centers, the principal benefits will be savings in vehicle
operating costs. These benefits will accrue largely to individuals and
road transporters who use the road. As the road transport industry in
Botswana is competitive and free of tariff controls, cost savings will be
passed on to business and industrial enterprises and to farmers served by
the road in the form of lower prices for goods and services.
5.D5      The Bobonong-Lekkerpoet road is a development road that will
help to integrate several small villages, small dryland farms, a large
scale irrigated farm and a game reserve into the Botswana road network.
Given the rural nature of the road, the economic justification is based on
traffic benefits and producer surplus arising from agricultural and tourism
development in the area. The remoteness and inaccessibility of the area
has suppressed such development and the road. which will follow recent
improvements to telecommunications and the ongoing extension of the
electric supply grid to the area, will reduce the major constraints to
development. Accordingly, significant benefits are expected from
incremental agricultural production, increased livestock sales and greater
use of tourist facilities. The beneficiaries range from subsistence
farmers and villagers along the road who will have $Wproved access to
agricultural extension services and markets to BDC through its ownership in
Talana Farm and Hashatu Game Reserve.
Sefophe-Martin's Drift Road
5.06      The economic costs comprise the cost of construction,
supervision and physical contingencies, as well as maintenance costs
incurred to keep the road in serviceable condition over its economic life.
Costs are net of taxes and price :ontingencies.  The principal economic
benefits consist of savings in vehicle operating costs and avoided
maintenance costs. The vehicle operating costs were based on vehicle
operating cost factors for Botewana and the differential in vehicle
operating costs between the present gravel and dirt tracks for existing
traffic and the new road of paved standard, and between the present longer
route and new road for diierted traffic (Annex 4). Avoided maintenance
costs also pertain because, although the new road will only generally
follow existing gravel and dirt roads in the area, these roads play an
important regional distribution role and would have to be maintained in the
absence of the new road.
5.07      The traffic forecasts used to estimate savings in vehicle
operating costs were derived from baseline counts, an origin-destination



- 29 -
survey conducted along the road and at border posts, information on past
trends, and growth rates consistent with conservative forecasts that take
into account such factors as proximity to activity centers, estimated
future geographical distribution of population and employment, and growth
in GDP. Although traffic overall in Botswana has been growing an average
of 10? per year (para 3.04), cars and vans on the Sefophe-Martin's Drift
road are forecast to increase 7.5X per annum over the first ten years and
all other traffic 52, with all traffic increasing 52 per annum thereafter.
A 202 jump in existing traffic was assumed in the opening year, based on
country-wide experience reported in the Botswana Road Design Manual. The
traffic assignment used to estimate diverted traffic was carried out on the
basis of the origin-destination survey.
5.08      Based on these assumptions, the ERR for the Sefophe-Martin's
Drift road is estimated to be 16Z (Annex 5). Although the traffic growth
rate is conservative in view of the significant growth in the industrial
base of Selebi-Phikwe being realized under the Selebi-Phikwe Technical
Assistance Project (paras. 1.11-1.12), the sensitivity of the estimate to
cost overruns, depressed traffic growth and delays in implementation was
also evaluated. Even the assumption of a combined 15? increase in total
costs and 152 lower traffic benefits (due to lower traffic growth or lower
operating cost savings per vehicle) failed to reduce the ERR below 12X. If
the implementation period were to extend to 7 years, the typical
implementation profile for Bank projects in Botswana, the ERR would drop
slightly to 15? (Annex 6).
Bobonong-Lekkerpoet Road
5.09      The analysis of construction and maintenance costs of the
Bobonong-Lekkerpoet road and of vehicle operating cost savings essentially
follows that of the Sefophe-Martin's Drift road. However, in view of the
rural nature of the Bobonong-Lekkerpoet road, annual traffic growth was
assumed to be 5? for all types of vehicles subsequent to the opening of the
road, after an initial jump of 20X for existing traffic in the opening year
(para 5.07). In addition, a range of development benefits were assessed,
including dryland and irrigated crop production, livestock production and
tourism, under the assumption that the remoteness and inaccessibility of
the area has suppressed such development.
5.10      The analysis of agricultural potential in the area of influence
of the road shows three areas in which improved road access would be likely
to stimulate agricultural production: large scale irrigated crop
production, small to medium scale irrigated crop production, and livestock
production. Conversely, the impact of a road on ctryland crop production
was deemed to be negligible. Although the road will improve access to
agricultural extension services, it passes through an area with low and
unreliable rainfall and poor soils; dryland crop failures are frequent and
the technical basis for changes in production is limited. -
5.11      Large scale irrigated crop production.  BDC operates Talana
Farm, a modern irrigation farm with about 400 ha of arable land at the
junction of the Motloutse and Limpopo rivers.  The main crops currently
grown are cotton, maize, potatoes and other vegetables. However, the
remoteness of the farm has made it difficult to attract and retain skilled



- 30 -
management, and this has adversely affected its financial performance.
Discussions with BDC, Talaua Farm management and an independent assessment
indicate that, given improved access, BDC would be prepared to increase the
farm's production of higher value vegetable crops and establish a 50 ha
citrus unit. Plans also exist for Talana II, a major expansion of the
existing operation. However, as a specific timetable and investment plan
have yet to be finalized, this major expansion was not considered in the
assessment of the road, even though the existence of the road would
facilitate the development and could well bring its implementation forward.
5.12      Small to medium scale irrigated crop production.  In addition to
Talana Farm, there are about 10 small to medium scale irrigated farms that
produce from about 1 ha of citrus inter-cropped with vegetables to about 20
ha used in part for watermelon and vegetable production. Only modest
benefits are anticipated from this source. as all of these farms face a
range of water supply, technical and marketing problems. While the road
will help to resolve locational problems, additional assistance in the form
of credit, input supply, technology and marketing will oe required to
realize the full potential of these farms.
5.13      Livestock production.  In addition to a positive impact on
agricultural production, the new road influences an area containing about
20 percent of the current regional population of about 170,000 cattle and
180,000 sheep and goats. Improved road access is likely to have a small
but positive impact on cattle production. This would arise from increased
purchases of feeder cattle from traditional owners by Tuli Block ranchers
for growingifattening, and increased sales from these ranches to the
Botswana Meat Commission (BMC) for slaughter. In addition, there is
greater potential to increase and further commercialize goat production
following improved road access.  This would require some organizational and
marketing assistance, but could lead to a substantial increase in sales of
smal stock and local cash income, as well as a reduction in grazing
pressure and related environmental benefits.
5.14      In the assessment of net benefits associated with incremental
agriculture and livestock production, incremental development and overhead
costs have been included as costs and estimated benefits (annual value
added) are net of incremental transport costs. In addition, a small
increase in occupancy rate of the game reserve is anticipated, as road
access from Botswana presently is difficult and most guests either fly in
at substantial cost or enter the reserve by road via RSA.
5.15      Based on this assessment, the ERR for the Bobonong-Lekkerpoet
road is estimated to be 12Z (Annex 7). In view of the potential marketing
problems, the sensitivity of the overall estimate to a large reduction in
agricultural benefits was evaluated. Re4uctions in agricultural benefits
of 30a and 50X were tested, causing the ERR to drop to 112 and 102,
respectively. A 151 increase in all costs, including road construction and
maintenance as well as agricultural development costs, reduced the ERR to
112. However, if all costs were 151 higher and all benefits 152 lower than
expected, the ERR would drop to 92. An implementation period of 7 years'
would yield an ERR of 111 (Annex,8).



-31-
C. Risks
5.16      The principal risk is that full realization of agricultural
benefits associated with the Bobonong-Lekkerpoet road may not occur without
improved horticultural marketing and supply management. Although the
physical environment along the lower Motloutse river is suitable and
technical production skills exist within BDC, SPRDU and elsewhere for
profitable fruit and vegetable production, more skillful grading, packaging
and supply management will be necessary if local producers are to capture a
larger share of the growing demand in Botswana. To reduce this risk, the
Government agreed at negotiations to prepare an agricultural development
plan for the region by September 1991, and take steps to facilitate
implementation of the plan. It was also agreed that early Bank supervision
missions will include an agricultural specialist to review and possibly
assist in preparation of the agricultural plan.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations agreement was reached with the Government on
the following:
(a) that the Government will continue to implement its plan for the
two-stage program for cost recovery from road users (para 3.11);
(b) that contracts for Bank-financed civil works will be awarded in
accordance with the Bank 'Guidelines for Procurement under World
Bank Loans and IDA Credits' of May 1985 (para 4.17);
(C) that consultants will be employed on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank (para 4.17);
(d) that retroactive financing will be required, at an aggregate
amount not to exceed US$200,000 (para 4.19);
(e) that all project accounts will be audited by the Auditor General
and that the Auditor's report for the Bank-financed components
will be submitted to the Bank not later than six months after
the end of the fiscal year (para 4.21);
(f) that MWTC will supply quarterly progress reports on the basis of
outlines agreed with the Bank (para 4.21);
(g)  that MWTC will prepare, not later than six months following
completion of the project, Part II of a Project Completion
Report on the basis of an outline to be agreed with the Bank
(para 4.21); and
