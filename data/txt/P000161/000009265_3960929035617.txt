-- MEORANDTUM AND RECIM4END&TION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO BOTSWANA
FOR A TULI BLOCK ROADS PROJECT
1.    I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Botswana for US$14.9 million equivalent for approval. The proposed loan
would be repayable over seventeen years, including five years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate and help finance a road project. The project
would be cofinanced by BADEA (US$6.4 million) and AfDB (US$1.3 million).
2.    Background.  Botswana's impressive economic growth of the past two
decades has been largely the result of gains in the production of minerals
and, to a lesser extent, the export of beef and output from a small industrial
and commercial sector. This mineral-led development has not been broadly
based, and thus a key objective in the Government's current National
Development Plan, 1985-1991, (NDP6) is to create greater and more equitable
economic opportunity outside of t'he capital-intensive mining enclaves. While
this is a national priority, there is particular urgency in Selebi-Phikwe, a
town that depends on a copper/nickel mine which fh-ws a progressive decline in
the level of production.  The Selebi-Phikwe/Tuli Block region is of strategic
importance for three reasons: (i) it is a relatively fertile area along the
Limpopo river with access to markets in Zimbabwe and the Republic of South
Africa (RSA); (ii) the town of Selebi-Phikwe, with its substantial water
resources and well developed infrastructure, offers an alternative growth pole,
to the water-scarce and increasingly congested capital, Gaborone; and (iii) it
is an area well suited for addressing issues of poverty and unemployment
through formal sector job creation and realization of considerable
agricultural potential. The objective of the Bank's ongoing Selebi-Phikwe
Technical Assistance Project (Ln. 2695-BT) is to promote growth and
diversification of the economic base of Selebi-Phikwe and its hinterlaud, and
determine the potential and scope for expandiug thie role of agriculture and
livestock in the regional economy. Considerable progress has been made,
primarily in the areas of job creation and agricultural development in the
immediate Selebi-Phikwe area. However, more remains to be done to facilitate
agricultural development in surrounding areas through improved access to
markets and assistance to farmers in the area. The Regional Development Unit,
established under the above project, will continue to provide institutional
support for this work.
3.    The approach taken in the Selebi-Phikwe Technical Assistance Project is
consistent with the Government's present approach to planning for roads, as
one of the project's tasks was to identify transport links needed to improve
marketing and servicing opportunities in the region. Initially after
Independence, the Government's primary objective was to establish a basic
network of main roads, in particular the north-south corridor in the
relatively developed eastern portion of the country. Now that much of the
basic network is in place, the focus has shifted to improving access to riral
areas and, as highlighted in NDP6, especially to areas with agricultural
potential or opportunities for productive employment. The Bank has
participated actively in the development of the basic network through Live
road projects, most showing dramatic traffic growth immediately upon



-2-
completion.  Project completion reports indicate the projects were
satisfactorily completed.  In addition to the Bank, contributors to the road
sector have Included AfDB, BADEA, EEC, KfW, NORAD, ODA and USAID. Other
agencies have contributed on a more modest basis, financing not only civil
works but also technical assistance and training.
4., The $mproved roads have been well maintained and budgetary allocations
for maintenance continue to be adequate. However, the road network has
expanded rapidly and, as road user charges have been low, cost recovery in the
sector has not kept pace with this expansion., Based on a study completed in
1988/89 the Government raised such charges in 1989 as a first step, but
recognizes that further steps will be required.  Also, from a road maintenance
perspective, this rapid growth and expansion into more remote areas has
increased both the cost and complexity of the maintenance problem.
Accordingly, the present maintenance management system and organizational
structure needs to be revised to meet the demands of the larger network. The
Government makes reference to these issues in NDP6 and has targeted them for
resolution during the plan period.
5.    Ratinale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project would support the
lank's country assistance strategy, developed jointly with the Government,
which emphasizes economic diversification and creation of employment
opportunities outside of capital-intensive mining enclaves. It would continue
the Bank's long involvement in Selebi-Phikwe, which dates back to 1969 and
1971 with the financing of water, rail and housing infrastructure (Cr. 172-BT
and Ln. 776-BT), and to 1974 with a loan to the Botswana Development
Corporation (Ln. 1019-BT) that included sub-loans for Talana Farm, a
commercial irrigated farm in the Tuli Block area, and for commercial property
development in Selebi-Phikwe.  More recently, the Bank has been instrumental
through the Selebi-Phikwe Technical Assistance Project in generating national
a*nd international interest in the region and ir facilitating a coordinated
approach to its development. The proposed project would support these efforts
by providing the basic road infrastructure needed to attract investors and
successfully develop the industrial and agricultural base of Selebi-Phikwe and
its hinterland. The Bank's participation would help to ensure the
coordination and timely implementation of these investments and realize the
ensuing developmental benefits. The project also would build on previous Bank
Involvement in the road subsector by strengthening the planning and
maintenance capability of the Roads Department (RD).
6.    Project Objectives.  The main objectives of the proposed project are to
(i) provide road links necessary for the development and integration of the
Selebi-Phikwe area and its hinterland, and facilitate its effectiveness as a
regional marketing center; (ii) strengthen the capacity of RD to organize and
carry out road maintenance at the increased level mandated by the expansion of
the road network; and (iii) improve road planning and programming capability.
7.    Pro1ect Description.  The project would consist of the following
components: (i) construction of a 134 km paved main road between Sefophe and
Martin's Drift, including a 10-km spur to the major village of Kgagodi, which
will link Selebi-Phikwe and RSA, and village access roads; (ii) construction
of a 66 km pavedigravel feeder road between Bobonong and Lekkerpoet, including



-3-
two short access roads to the villages of Kololatau and Mathathane, which will
link farming and tourist. areas to the main road and external markets; and
(iii) a maintenance management system and organization study, combined with a
network planning study, which will facilitate monitoring. planning and
carrying out of road maintenance. The total cost of the project is estimated
at US$37.6 million, with alforeign exchange component of US$26.2 million
(70?). Details of the project costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. Procurement methods, amounts and the disbursement schedule are given in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Botswana are given in Schedules C and D,
*        respectively.  A map, IBRD No. 22255, is also attached.
8.    Actions Aareed. During negotiations, agreement was reached with the
Government on the followings  (i) that the Government will continue to
implement its plan for a comprehensive restructuring of road user fees, with
recovery of maintenance and replacement cost from transit traffic by June
1991, and from all traffic by June 1993; and (ii) that the Government will
prepare an agricultural development plan, subject to Bank review, for the Tuli
Block region by September 1991, and take steps to facilitate its
implementation.
9.   Justification and Risks.  Substantial benefits are expected to accrue
from the reduction in transport costs with consequent favorable effects on
production and marketing costs in the region. The project is expected to
facilitate the development and diversification of the regional economy by
improving the accessibility of Selebi-Phikwe both within the region and with
respect to national and external markets. By opening up an area consisting of
rural farm and villages and by providing better access to a game reserve, the
project also will lay the groundwork for increased agricultural and livestock
production and tourism in the area. The economic rate of return for ttse
proposed project is estimated to be 15 percent. The principal risk is that
full realization of agricultural benefits associated with the Bobonong-
Lekkerpoet road may not occur without improved horticultural marketing and
supply management. To reduce this risk, the Government has agreed to prepare
an agricultural development plan for the region (para. 8).
10.   Recomendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Director approve the proposed loan.
