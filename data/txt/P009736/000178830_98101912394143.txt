I. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background and Organization
1.01      The large area of India and the widespread dispersal of population
throughout the country creates a need for widespread and efficient telecom-
munications services. Successive Governments of India have recognized that
a free and rapid flow of information throughout the ccuntry is a necessary
prerequisite to the efficient operation of agriculture, industry, commerce,
transportation, and government administration. This has also been recog-
nized by the Bank Group which has assisted in the sector over the past
16 years. At the present time, however, even though there are more than two
million telephones in the country, there is still much to be done to improve
access to and quality of telecommunications service.
1.02      The telecommunications sector in India is state owned and comprises
the following:
(a) the Posts and Telegraphs Department (P&T), under the Ministry
of Communications, operates all the public telecommunications
facilities within India, and to adjacent countries;
(b) the Overseas Communications Service (OCS), a separate govern-
ment agency, which operates the international service to non-
adjacent countries. The OCS is responsible to the Secretary
of the Ministry of Communications; and
(c) the telecommunications manufacturing industry of which the
three major entities are the government-owned Indian Tele-
phone Industries Limited (ITI), Hindustan Cables Limited (HCL)
and Hindustan Teleprinters Limited (HTL). In addition to
these there are a considerable number of small-scale indus-  1/
tries which act as subcontractors to the major manufacturers.-
1.03      The sector provides a significant source of employment with the
Telecommunications Branch of P&T employing approximately 250,000 full-time
staff and an equivalent of 130,000 on casual hirings. The three largest
manufacturers have about 30,000 employees. The majority of these people
are employed away from the major metropolitan cities.
Access to Service
1.04      While in absolute terms India has a comparatively large network
by world standards, with more than 1.7 million direct exchange lines (DELs)
and more than two million telephones, the density and quality of telephone
and telex services is poor compared to many other countries. India's
1/ For example, HTL, the smallest of the big three, currently has about
85 small-scale industrial units subcontracting to it.

telephone density-/ of 0.3 is low compared with Malaysia - 2.7; Papua New
Guinea - 1.3; Philippines - 1.2; Thailand - 0.8; and Sri Lanka - 0.5.   The
average for Asia, excluding Japan, is 0.6 while the world average is 9.6
(Annex 1).
1.05      The geographical distribution of telephone lines in India at
March 1978 is as follows:
Location             Number       Percent Distribution      Thlephon
of lines      Lines   Population         Density-
Four largest metEg-
politan cities-          601,000        34           4             2.7
Rest of country          1,173,000        66          96             0.2
Total India              1,774,000       100         100             0.3
1.06      The telephone density in the major cities of India is also low
compared with principal cities  in other countries.  In India density varies
from about 2 for cities such as Hyderabad, Calcutta and Lucknow to close to
4 for Delhi and Bombay. This compares with telephone denLsities of 4.6 for
Bangkok; 7.7 for Manila; 8.2 for Tehran; 10.8 for Nairobi; and 16.3 for
Singapore.
1.07      The present official waiting list for telephone service in India
is about 200,000 of which about 124,000 are in the four major cities.
However, many rural areas and towns are without service, and thus have no
officially recorded waiters, and in places with service prospective sub-
scribers normally wait for many years. There is consequently a large level
of suppressed or hidden demand. The waiting listis- also suppressed
due to relatively high system access charges. In order to register as an
applicant for telephone service, it is necessary to pay an advance deposit
varying from Rs 1,000 (US$116) to Rs 5,000 (US$581). This arrangement was
introduced in 1976 and resulted in a drop in the official waiting list of
about 400,000 (see para. 2.03). An additional result of the advance
deposit scheme is that the vast majority of waiters on the current lists
are business firms or persons whose telephones will be paid for by business
or government.
1.08      In rural areas, the gap between the demand and the supply of
telephone services is also very large, despite the fact tlhat the GOI and
P&T has been allocating a significant share of the availalble resources into
non-city areas for many years. Away from the larger towns, the telephone

- 3-
service is provided over a network of long distance public call offices
(PCOs) which comprise a single open wire line with a telephone connecting
the town or village into the national telephone network. As demand in a
rural town grows, a small telephone exchange is installed at the PCO and
the original line used as a trunk circuit to the network.
1.09      In April 1978, there were about 8,000 PCOs and 4,300 small (less
than 100 lines) telephone exchanges. Of the 8,000 PCOs, over 7,000 of them
were located in places with more than 5,000 population.l/  Of the 45,000
towns with a population exceeding 2,000, only one-third have telephone
facilities either in the form of a long distance PCO or a telephone exchange.
Quality of Service
1.10      Due to the significant shortage of telephone lines and network
overloading, the calling rates in most large cities in India are very high
and the probability of making a successful call is relatively low. For
example, in Bombay, Delhi and Calcutta, sampling studies have shown that
during business hours 40% to 50% of all call attempts fail because the
called telephone is busy. This phenomenon brings about repeated call
attempts to busy numbers and as a result, generates additional traffic
throughout the network. This not only creates congestion in the call
handling plant, which is shared by all subscribers, but also increases the
overall probability of encountering a busy subscriber.
1.11      Technical failures in the network -- failure of a call because of
faulty equipment -- are also high. The P&T has, however, initiated some
remedial measures to improve performance and a management information system
is now being developed to help identify particular problems and set targets
for improvement.
1.12      There is also a high level of congestion in the long distance
network brought about by the difficulties of completing calls through the
local networks and by inadequate provision of trunk switching equipment.
This particularly affects the automatic (STD) trunk network during daytime
hours. Manual trunk calls also encounter delays sometimes exceeding two to
four hours. In the case of manual trunk calls, it is possible to pay
higher charges and get a priority connection. In the longer term, however,
the most effective method of improving the manual trunk service will be to
divert traffic to the STD network and the current five-year plan provides
for increased additions to the automatic trunk switching system.
Sector Constraints
1.13      The major constraint in the development of an efficient tele-
communications system in India is the lack of resources which have been
made available to the sector. The Government of India has severely limited
1/ According to the 1971 Census there were approximately 570,000 towns
or villages in India with a population less than 5,000.



-4-
the amount of investment in the sector, and at the presenlt time is deliber-
ately restricting telecommunications investment in the three largest cities.
In the past the Government resource constraint related ma:Lnly to foreign
exchange since adequate quantities of local currency are generated through
telephone tariffs. With the present level of tariffs and the steadily
expanding STD network, P&T will be able during the next three years to pro-
duce internally over 69% of its investment needs (100% if transfer to cover
postal loss is not considered), even allowing for the conitinuation of a
policy of covering postal losses from telecommunications earnings.l/
1.14      Other constraints on the sector include the magnitude and diversity
of the construction work required to upgrade the system and the production
capacity of ITI, the Indian switching equipment manufacturer. The latter
constraint is short run in nature and is being alleviated somewhat by
increasing imports of switching equipment under Bank loans and bilateral
assistance.
Sector Objectives
1.15      During the new five-year plan period, the objectives for the
sector (see Annex 2) fall far short of meeting the demand for telecommuni-
cations services in India. The objectives are realistic, however, in that
they are achievable.
1.16      The main thrust of the 1979-83 plan is to expand the availability
and quality of service outside of the big four urban areas of Delhi, Bombay,
Calcutta and Madras (see Annex 3). This complements the GOI national develop-
ment policy of encouraging development in backward and rural areas, smaller
towns and new growth centers. By 1983 some form of telephone service will be
extended to practically all towns with a population greater than 5,000 and
to some villages with a population greater than 2,500 in the "hilly and
backward" areas.  It is proposed to provide 15,000 new long distance PCOs
during the five-year period, bringing the total number of rural PCOs in
India to approximately 21,700.
1.17      Three other important sector objectives are:  (a) to concentrate
metropolitan city investment and expansion in such a manner as to reduce
the number and waiting time of the high priority OYT applicants2/; (b) to
upgrade the quality of service insofar as traffic congestion and trans-
mission performance are concerned in both the local and long distance
networks; and (c) to steadily increase local equipment manufacturing capa-
bilities to continue the move towards greater self-reliance and increased
import-substitution within the sector.  While expansion of local manu-
facturing has significant cost saving implications for P&T (para. 6.11),
the industry expansion objective also brings with it the need to maintain

of all capital and operating expenses of the Postal Branch of P&T.
2/ OYT stands for "own your telephone" and represents a scheme in which
potential subscribers (mostly business and government) who pay relatively
large advance deposits (US$581) receive priority status for obtaining a
telephone (para. 3.24).

an effort on applied research and development so as to facilitate the orderly
adaptation to the Indian situation of new technologies and to provide the
skills necessary for their management, ongoing operation and maintenance.
These objectives are sound.
1.18       Selected parameters reflecting forecast changes in the sector over
the 1978-83 period are shown below:

Investment Program
1.19       The broad distribution of main plant investments under the 1978-83
Telecommunications Plan between local networks in urban and rural areas and
the long distance network is as follows:

1/  Urban areas include metropolitan areas and district centers.
In financing this heavy expansion program, the Telecommunications Branch of P&T
will rely heavily on internal funding. The internal funding ratio during the
three-year project period will average over 69% while during the five-year
national telecommunications planning period it will average 73%.
The Bank's Role in the Sector
1.20      The Bank has been associated with the sector since 1962 and previous
loans and credits comprise:

Loan   1313-IN        1976        80
Total                 368
1.21      During this period, the Bank Group has provided much of the foreign
exchange required for the P&T's telecommunications development program although
in recent years there has been an increasing injection of foreign exchange
through bilateral loans and credits. The number of telephones has increased
since 1962 from 373,000 to more than two million; the trunk network has been
expanded and modernized, and an automatic telex network established with cur-
rently more than 20,000 subscribers. The Bank has also assisted the P&T in
modernizing its organizational and management structure, aLnd in establishing
an Economic Cell which has begun to analyze pricing and irnvestment issues in
the sector. The manufacturing entities have grown in line with P&T's needs,



-7-
and the proposed loan to provide necessary capital equipment for upgrading
and modernizing the factories, will advance their efficiency and maintain
low equipment costs for P&T (para. 6.11).
1.22      The success of the Bank involvement with the Indian telecommuni-
cations sector may also be judged by the declining dependence of the P&T
capital works programs on Bank Group financing. During the 1970s, the
annual actual and planned Bank disbursements to India for telecommunications
development have varied between US$30 million and US$40 million, while the
capital works programs have increased from around US$120 million in the
early 1970s, to US$480 million in the late 1970s.
1.23      A project performance audit has been conducted on the third and
fourth lending operations to Telecommunications in India. These projects
were considered by the audit to be successful. Some of the more significant
observations of the audit were:
(a) institutional and organizational achievements were substantial
including implementation of commercial accounting and manage-
ment information systems;
(b) the projects contributed to the development of rural telecom-
munications and national telecommunications industries; and
(c) P&T did not achieve the high construction targets aimed at and
therefore resulted in traffic congestion on the system and
longer than expected waiting times for connection to the system.
Improvement in this area is planned in the proposed project.

II.  DEMAND
2.01      Demand for telephone service in the Indian environment is difficult
to forecast with any degree of confidence. In preparing the new 1978-83 tele-
communications plan, the P&T and the GOI Planning Commission produced widely
differing demand forecasts, and earlier in 1972 when the laLst detailed study
was carried out, the committee responsible for the work produced upper and
lower estimates with a very wide divergence; the lowest estimate for telephone
demand in 1981 was 2.25 million, while the highest estimate was 8.5 million.
2.02      Part of the problem in attempting to forecast the demand for telecom-
munications services is that in India, as in much of the developing world,
there has not been a period during the last 20 years when supply has caught up
with demand. Hence, in addition to the officially registered demand, there has
consistently been an unknown quantity of latent demand which was not recorded
on official waiting lists since lists were not available, ats in unserved areas,
or because in areas with some service the chances of being connected within a
reasonable time period were virtually nil.
2.03      The demand forecasting problem is further aggravated by two discon-
tinuities in the schedule of registered total demand. 1/ Ihe first came in 1971
when a Rs 10 application fee was made mandatory, and the second in 1976, when an
advance deposit scheme was introduced. In the latter case, deposits varying
from Rs 1,000 (US$116) to Rs 5,000 (US$581) were required at the time of regis-
tration from all applicants including those who were alreadly on existing wait-
ing lists. The effect of the 1971 and 1976 administrative actions on the
schedule of registered demand can be seen in the following table, and in the
graph in Annex 4.
1/ Registered total demand is roughly defined as the number of direct exchange
lines (DELs) and the number of officially registered wa,iters.

2.04      The compromise reached between the Indian Planning Commission and
P&T in arriving at an acceptable demand forecast has been to project ahead
at a growth rate roughly equal to the past growth in supply. The mission
considers that this is a significant underestimate of actual demand and that
total unsatisfied demand in India, particularly in the large urban areas, will
probably increase by an even greater amount during the next five years than
is officially acknowledged. Given the increased emphasis on supplying OYT
waiters, however, the number of OYT waiters in the large cities should fall,
and the average OYT waiting time should generally be reduced to less than one
year.
2.05      More work needs to be done on the question of the structure of
demand for telephone services in India and on its relationship to tariff
policy. This view is agreed with by P&T and the recently formed Economic
Research Cell has agreed to embark on a more extensive study of urban and
rural telephone demand.

III. THE BORROWER AND THE BENEFICIARIES
Introduction
3.01      The Bank Group has been continuously associated with the tele-
communications sector since 1962, and has had six lending operations with
the P&T amounting to US$368 million. These lending operations have provided
60% of the foreign exchange requirements of P&T's development programs
whose total cost was about US$2.3 billion. During this period the Tele-
communications Branch of the P&T and its supporting manufacturing wing have
grown and matured due in part to the encouragement and direction provided
by the Bank Group.  The whole sector has become more self-reliant and
increasing local production from its manufacturers has enabled larger P&T
programs to be undertaken. The scope of the proposed lending will, in
addition to supporting the telecommunications development plan of P&T as
in previous operations, cover the expansion and improvement of the domestic
telecommunications factories. This change to an overall sector lending
will enable a coordinated and balanced expansion of the two closely inter-
dependent groups, viz P&T and the factories.
3.02      In all of the prior lending operations, the borrower has been the
Government of India and the beneficiary has been the Telecommunications
Branch of P&T. In the proposed project, there will be four beneficiaries:
(i) the Telecommunications Branch of P&T; (ii) Indian Telephone Industries
(ITI); (iii) Hindustan Cables Ltd. (HCL); and (iv) Hindustan Teleprinters Ltd.
(HTL).
Organization
3.03      P&T is a gover=nent department under the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Communications. A seven member board of senior executives
chaired by the Director General (who is also the Secretary in the Ministry)
is responsible for the control of its operations. The Finance Member of
the Board additionally reports directly to the Ministry of Finance. The
Organization Chart is provided in Annex 5.
3.04      The three manufacturing entities, ITI, HCL, and HTL, are government
corporations controlled by Boards of Directors chaired by their Managing
Directors. ITI and HTL come under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of
Communications while HCL is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of
Industrial Development. These relationships are also shown in Annex 5.
3.05      In previous operations, the Bank Group was also instrumental in
identifying and helping the removal of some bottlenecks in procurement of
raw materials and components to increase production. The Bank's role in
this project, in respect of the domestic factories, viz ITI, HCL and HTL,
is considerably greater. Paragraphs 3.26 to 3.36 give inf,ormation on the
current organization and production of these factories ancd 3.37 on the
current deficiencies. The expansion and improvement proposal is discussed
in Chapter IV.



- 11 -
3.06      Traffic Engineering - The effectiveness of the present traffic engi-
neering group is inhibited by its organizational location under the Member,
Operations. The outputs from the group serve as important inputs to the plan-
ning and development of the network and, while they also provide a service to
the operations management, the optimum organizational location for traffic
engineering is close to the technical planners. During appraisal it was sug-
gested that the traffic engineering unit be moved from Operations to Technical
Development. During negotiations the P&T advised that it had decided to estab-
lish a new traffic engineering group under the Member, Technical Development,
which would also deal with network dimensioning and forward projections while
leaving the existing group to deal with day-to-day operational matters.
3.07      Economic Research Cell - This group is now beginning to function
effectively and is already recognized by management as a valuable addition to
the organization. Although its Director, who is an economist, had only one
staff member in position at the time of appraisal, the selection and appoint-
ment processes for the remainder of his establishment were in hand. After
reviewing the position during appraisal, it was considered that the establish-
ment could be strengthened by the addition of a second economist to complement
and assist the work of the cost accountants and engineers already provided.
During negotiations it was noted that the existing establishment of the cell
had become fully staffed and it was agreed that the question of adding a second
economist to the cell should be reviewed in the light of its performance after
12 months' operations at full strength.
3.08      Quality of Service - There has been continuing discussion between
the P&T and the Bank concerning ways in which the service quality might be
upgraded. Two approaches have been considered--one being the application of
tariffs designed to reduce peak traffics and ration access to the service,
and the second comprising technical upgrading and modified administrative
procedures designed to increase the traffic-carrying capacity of the network
and to divert some traffic away from the overloaded switching centers.
Pricing aspects are discussed in more detail in paragraphs 6.07 to 6.09.
3.09      In line with the second approach, the P&T Board has recently approved
the allocation of additional exchange lines to existing customers who are ident-
ified as having such a high calling (or receiving) rate that they contribute
significantly to the "called subscriber busy" phenomenon, one of the major
*          reasons for the high number of repeat attempts causing congestion in the net-
work (see para. 1.10). These subscribers will be required to take additional
lines as determined by the P&T from traffic studies   Similarly, customers with
PBXs with insufficient exchange lines will be identified and required to take
additional lines. A further administrative change being introduced is the
removal of the restriction on the provision of tie lines between PBXs and out-
door extensions, where the provision of such lines requires the use of a primary
cable pair.  Tie lines will now be allowed, and encouraged, throughout the
city networks.
3.10      The P&T has already conducted a field study into the quality of the plant
between the telephone and the local exchange and has identified a variety of
deficiencies which are contributing to the poor service quality. The implemen-
tation of the recommendations from this study was discussed during appraisal
and the P&T advised at negotiations that a two-year (1977-79) implementation
program for the major recommendations had been approved.



- 12 -
3.11      A variety of special network performance studies are required to
supplement the information now becoming available from the ]MIS (see para. 3.12)
in order to fully understand the problems of service quality and to plan
remedial action.  Over the past few years, the P&T has established a number of
expert committees which have studied specific aspects of network performance
and many of their recommendations are now being implemented. More recently a
"Committee on the Working of Metropolitan Telephone Districts" with broad
terms of reference, including management and technical aspects of the operations
and maintenance of the network, has reported its conclusions to the P&T Board.
Specific recommendations currently under consideration by the P&T Board include
gas pressurization of primary subscriber cables and junction cables, wide-
spread use of jelly filled distribution cables, introductioln of duct systems
on important cable routes, increased rationalization and fl,exibility of sub-
scribers cable networks, and introduction of operational planning cells in
the Metropolitan Telephone Districts in order to decentralize service performance
studies and development of upgrading programs. Implementation of these recom-
mendations and those flowing from the other expert committees should progressively
improve the quality of telecommunications service in the meitropolitan networks.
3.12      Management Information System (MIS) - The MIS is now beginning to
contribute to a better understanding of the quality of servLce and is setting
targets for progressive improvement in a variety of areas. The monitoring
indices it has established are comprehensive and, with the addition of a new
indicator to monitor "called subscriber busy" as agreed during appraisal, are
adequate to meet existing requirements. The system has been developed to
monitor the performance of the network in all districts and circles and both
regional and national targets are being set. Short run targets and longer
term objectives based on the performance of developed country networks will
enable the effectiveness of the network upgrading strategies to be measured.
The system needs further development to provide better summaries for top
management and this is in hand. Its further development wi:Ll be reviewed
during supervision missions.
3.13      Staff and Training - At March 31, 1977, the Telecommunications
Branch had a full time staff of abou-t 236,000 and a staff ratio of about 148
per 1,000 DELs. This staff level must be considered high by developing world
standards reflecting India's perference for labor intensive methods and the
employment of as many people as can be justified. Despite the high labor
content, the average cost per new DEL is not high by international standards.
The larger staff requirement can be justified to some degree by:
(a) extensive openwire routes requiring a higher level of maintenance
than more modern trunk route construction methods;,
(b) the many small manual exchanges;
(c)  the extensive manually operated telegraph and long-distance
telephone facilities;



- 13 -
(d) the practice of utilizing P&T's staff to construct all
facilities; and
(e) the increasing number of rural PCOs whose construction,
operation and maintenance is highly labor intensive.
The staff level is expected to increase to 358,000 by March 31, 1981,
with the staff ratio remaining fairly constant. In the longer term,
P&T must improve productivity particularly in the maintenance, operations,
and management areas through improving training and increasing management
application of its Management Information System.
3.14      A comprehensive training program helps to insure that this large
staff is properly trained to meet the requirements of the growing telecom-
munications network. P&T maintains 26 circle and district training centers
which can accommodate about 27,000 students annually to train operating
staff and technicians as well as 13 regional training centers which can
accommodate about 3,500 students annually to train junior engineers.
Additionally, an advanced level training center has been temporarily
established in New Delhi with the assistance of UNDP/ITU. The purpose of
this center is to keep senior staff informed on the latest developments and
equip them to apply modern techniques in the solution of the problems of
their rapidly growing facilities. In July 1978, this training facility
will be moved to its permanent 45 acre site at Ghaziabad and will provide
about 35 courses for telecommunications personnel of the other countries
in the ESCAP region as well as for personnel of P&T.
3.15      P&T continues to provide training for its accounting-financial
staff and to send senior staff outside P&T for training.
3.16      The training facilities now available are adequate to meet the
training requirements during the 1979-83 planning period.
3.17      Accounting - The Telecommunications Branch has developed a com-
mercial accounting system which is maintained separately from the
conventional cash accounts required for reporting to government on the
financial activities of P&T. These commercial accounts are audited by
the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) and are presented to Parliament
as a measure of financial performance of the Telecommunications Branch.
Management also utilizes the commercial accounts as a major source of data
in its Management Information System.
3.18      There is a need to maintain both the Telecommunications Branch's
commercial accounts and the P&T's government cash accounts under rules
which have been accepted by the C&AG so that he can give his prior approval
to their application and his staff is able to reconcile transactions between
the cash and accrued accounts during audit. This to some degree limits the
Branch's ability to revise and refine its commercial accounting methods to
make the financial statements more meaningful and useful.



- 14 -
3.19      An example of improvements which should be made to the Telecommuni-
cations Branch's commercial accounts is:
The Branch utilizes supplemental depreciation iLn an effort to
reflect the effects of inflation on the operatiLons of the Branch.
This mehtod, if based on sound rate development, would make the
necessary adjustments to the income statement but neglects the
effect of inflation on the value of fixed assets, thus distort-
ing the rate base and consequently the rate of return.  The
Branch should compute depreciation at an applicable total rate
per asset classification and reduce the asset value by this
accumulated depreciation for the computation of the rate of
return on net assets.
3.20      Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Branch would
review its commercial accounting methods and discuss any suggested changes
with C&AG. However, the specific question of the desirability of continuation
of the practice of "supplemental depreciation" would be addressed during the
asset valuation study (para. 5.08).
3.21      Audit - Under the Constitution, the C&AG is responsible for the
auditing of government accounts. In the past, this audit: has not been com-
pleted until a year or more after the close of the fiscal year. The principal
reason for this delay was that the Postal Branch's accounting function was
performed by the C&AG's staff and therefore was not under the control of P&T.
This arrangement also resulted in numerous inter-branch adjustments at year
end and delays in finalizing the audit. In recognition of this, the Bank in
the past had agreed to accept unaudited financial statements within four
months after fiscal year end followed by audited statemeents as soon as they y
were available. From April 1, 1976, the Postal Branch accounting function
has been transferred to P&T and management anticipates that a more timely audit
will be possible. P&T intended to progressively work toward the objective
of finalization of the annual audited accounts of the Telecommunications
Branch, and submission of such accounts to the Bank within six months of the
close of each financial year. P&T will prepare a timetable for attaining
this objective by November 30, 1978. For the fiscal year 1979, P&T would
submit provisional accounts within four months and audited accounts within
ten months of the end of the fiscal year.
3.22      Tariffs - There are no regulations establishing a tariff policy for
P&T, but there is an annual tariff review. Recommendaticins for tariff revisions
after P&T Board approval are placed before Parliament, for a period of 30 days.
If no objection is registered in Parliament, which is the normal experience,
the new tariff can be made operative. The last tariff revision which increased
the rate for most of the main services and resulted in about a 20% increase
in revenues, was made effective April 1, 1976. The present tariffs are satis-
factory and, based on earnings projections (see para. 5.13), there does not
appear to be any need for tariff increases for financial reasons during the
project period. A summary of the current tariff is given in Annex 6.
3.23      The status of the OYT program was reviewed.  This category of service,
which was initiated in 1949, attempts to allocate new lines on a priority
basis to applicants who have demonstrated the greatest need for telephone
service measured by their ability to make a significant advance deposit.



- 15 -
This deposit is applied against future rental charges on a proportionate
basis over a period of 20 years. In 1976, the P&T introduced the advance
deposit scheme whereby all applicants were required to lodge deposits with
their applications for service, irrespective of the likely waiting time.
3.24      The OYT waiting lists have been decreasing, particularly in
Bombay where the waiting has been the longest. In 1978, the OYT waiting
list in Bombay decreased from 33,000 to 23,000 when 23,000 new DELS were
brought into service. This trend is expected to continue under the pro-
posed project since 30,000 additional DELs per annum will be available in
Bombay during the 1979-81 fiscal period. Because of the advance deposit
scheme, the application rate (particularly under OYT) is depressed when
there is a long waiting time for connections. Without knowing the number
of additional OYT applicants which can be expected when P&T demonstrates
its ability to provide the service, we cannot conclusively state that
OYT waiters will be entirely eliminated by the end of fiscal year 1981.
However, the waiting time, which in many cases is five years or more,
will certainly be reduced, probably to less than one year.
3.25      Customer Billing and Collection - P&T attempts to limit the
total value of its customers' accounts to not more than the value of 58
days of revenues. In order to maintain this level, they have effectively
utilized their MIS to monitor the region's and center's performance.
Although P&T does not anticipate a great need for its application, it has
received government approval to disconnect government accounts for non-
payment. Recent performance has not been as good as the 58 day goal
because of late billing resulting from inability to obtain timely
computer services. P&T believes that this is a temporary condition
which will occur from time to time until they are able to obtain
their own computer. The desirability of P&T having its own computer
is a subject which will come up with increasing regularity based on
the extent of P&TVs operations. This subject is under constant review
by P&T and will be watched during subsequent Bank supervision missions.
P&T's customers receivable level continues to be reasonable and no
additional measures are considered necessary for its control.
The Telecommunications Equipment Manufacturers (ITI, HCL and HTL)
3.26      Indian Telephone Industries (ITI) is the largest of the three
main manufacturers and its production units consist of factories located
at Bangalore, Naini and Rae Bareli employing 18,000, 4,000 and 1,500
people respectively. In additiQn, it has an electronic switching division
at Palghat and a components division at Srinagar. The company manufactures
switching equipment, transmission equipment, telephone instruments and
other miscellaneous telecommunications equipment. Approximately 85 percent
of its output is purchased by the P&T. The remaining 15 percent is sold to
GOI entities such as Railways, Overseas Communications Service, etc.; to
private industry; and about two percent is exported.
3.27      The quality and price of its equipment is competitive by world
standards although its production methods are more labor intensive than is
the case in developed countries and some of its plant and processes are



- 16 -
outdated. It has a competent research and development group which is
directed towards improvement of its existing products, initegration and
adaptation of new technologies into new products and acquiring knowledge
of new technology and techniques rather than towards the independent
development of major new switching or transmission systems. Its invest-
ment in R&D is appropriate for these objectives.
3.28      The output of ITI has grown roughly in parallel with the demands
of the P&T growth although at present it is unable to produce sufficient
switching equipment to provision the P&T works program. 'It has developed
and is extending local production capability of transmission equipment and
is progressively reducing the need for import of complete systems. It has
an active import substitution program designed to reduce the imported raw
material and component content of its locally manufactured equipment. Its
total turnover has grown from Rs 419 million (US$48.7 mil:Lion) in FY73 to
Rs 881 million (US$102 million) in FY77.
3.29      Hindustan Cables Limited (HCL) produces a wide variety of tele-
phone cables and line wire with a total output of approximately US$50
million in FY77. It supplies virtually all of the P&T requirement for
telephone cables and line wire as well as selling to other GOI entities
and on the export market. It has factories at Rupnarainpur and Hyderabad
where it employs 3,000 and 900 people respectively.
3.30      HCL's output goes primarily to the P&T but it also produces
cables for other customers such as Indian Railways and is meeting with
some success on the export market. Apart from small size jelly filled
distribution cable and small diameter coaxial cable, it haLs been able to
fully meet the P&T requirements.
3.31      The company undertakes a reasonable amount of research and
development, designed mainly to improve its existing products. It is
planned to increase this effort and initiate some work in the field of
optical fibers with a view to improving its firsthand knowrledge of this
important emerging technology.
3.32      Its products are technically good and its prices are competiti-
tive in the international market. Its output has grown from Rs 150
million (US$18 million) in FY74 to over Rs 450 million (US$50 million)
in FY77.
3.33      Hindustan Teleprinters Limited (HTL)  produces teleprinters,
electric typewriters, data modems and miscellaneous items of telegraph and
data equipment. Its main product line is the teleprinter which, together
with spares and accessories, accounts for more than 95% of its output.
The company was established in 1960 and its factory is located at Madras.
It currently employs about 2,000 people.
3.34      Since 1970, it has been producing between 5,000 and 6,000 tele-
printers per year, of which 60 to 70 percent are sold to the P&T, about
30 percent to other government and business customers and about two percent
exported. It has maintained the capacity to meet the P&T requirements and
has the potential to do so in the future.



- 17 -
3.35      The price of its products is competitive by world standards and
they are technically sound. Its major product, the teleprinter is cheaper
than internationally produced machines but is not of modern design and its
operating and maintenance costs would be greater than for more expensive
higher technology machines. Nevertheless, it is judged adequate for the
Indian telecommunications network and has won export orders. HTL has a small
research and development group which requires expansion as is planned.
3.36      All three companies based their selling price to P&T on production
costs plus an agreed markup as a profit margin. The three manufacturers'
production facilities were reviewed in some depth and it was verified that
their products are competitively priced compared with the world industry
and are technically sound.
3.37      The major shortcoming in the operations of all three companies is
the absence of effective quality assurance procedures and it was agreed
during negotiations that all companies would introduce a properly documented
quality assurance program agreeable to the Borrower and the Bank by March 31,
1980. In addition it was recommended that ITI increase its planned investment
for improved testing equipment and that HTL upgrade its R&D effort. The
investment programs have been modified to cater for this and were confirmed
during negotiations.

IV. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
4.01      Prior Bank telecommunications projects dealt only with the require-
ments and program of the operating entity, P&T. This telecommunications pro-
ject is a sector project and comprises four subprojects. The major subproject
is concerned with the P&T network development and is treated in paragraphs
4.02 to 4.15. The remaining three subprojects are concerned with upgrading
the three equipment manufacturing plants and are treated in paragraphs 4.16
to 4.41.
The P&T Program and Subproject
4.02      In the past, the GOI and the P&T operated within the guidelines of
discrete five-year plans, the last or fifth, covering the period from
April 1, 1974 through March 31, 1979. Late last year, GOI decided to abandon
this procedure and introduce a new concept of rolling five-year plans, the
first of these covering the period April 1978 - March 1983. As a result, we
have a new five-year telecommunications plan which will be reviewed and
updated annually. The broad objectives of the plan are set out in Annex 2
and detailed physical targets are shown in Annex 7.
4.03      The five-year plan provides for an addition of 1.15 million DELs
to the system, of which 350,000 will be provided in Bombay (160,000), Delhi
(100,000), Calcutta (65,000) and Madras (25,000), 200,000 in other telephone
districts, which includes the larger regional cities, and 600,000 in the
telephone circles, which comprise basically rural areas of the country.
This will not meet the expected demand but it does represent a step up in
the growth rate of the network compared with previous plans and should reduce
the waiting time for service connections. The most important time slice of
the five-year plan is the first three years because many of the lead times
for expanding the network are such that commitments must be made and orders
placed early in the first year for construction and instalLation in the third
year. Over the first three years, 1978 to 1981, of the five-year plan, the
planned achievements represent a program which, in total, is close to the
physical maximum achievable program within that time frame. Beyond the first
three years, increased programs would be possible and would be desirable in
order to satisfy more of the outstanding demand for telecommunications
service.
4.04      The estimated cost of the five-year plan is Rs 23,069 million
(US$2,682 million) including foreign costs of Rs 5,157 million (US$600 million).
A summary of the costs of the various components of the plan is set out in
Annex 8 while Annex 9 shows the break-uD of investment betwgeen various
parts of the country.
4.05      The FY79-81 three-year program, which is part of the five-year plan,
comprises:



- 19 -
(a) ongoing works under the sixth project and a number of other
works financed by bilateral credits with a combined base
cost of Rs 1,385 million (US$161 million);
(b) the seventh project with a base cost of Rs 5,582 million
(US$649 million) for which Bank financing is proposed
(cost including contingencies is estimated as Rs 6,639
million or US$772 million);
(c) future works with a base cost of Rs 3,355 million (US$390
million) for which financing of the foreign exchange
component (Rs 868 million - US$101 million) has yet to be
arranged; and
(d) a domestic satellite system providing meteorological and
television broadcast facilities as well as telecommunications.
(The P&T would be expected to meet about one-third of the
total cost of the system which would make its share Rs 840
million - US$98 million).
4.06      The estimated cost of the three-year program including contingencies
is Rs 13,131 million (US$1,527 million) including foreign costs of Rs 2,804
million (US$326 million). Details of the costs are shown in Annex 10.
4.07      Adequacy of the Five-year Plan and Three-year Program - Both the
five-year plan and the three-year program have a heavy emphasis on the develop-
ment of the rural telecommunications service. As a result, it has been
necessary, because of physical limitations in the first three years and an
overall GOI imposed investment constraint in subsequent years, to accept some
underprovision in the four major cities. However, the trunk network and the
telex network will be extended and upgraded significantly and the planned
expansion of the local networks in the large cities should be sufficient to
significantly reduce the waiting time for connections, particularly for OYT
applicants.
4.08      The P&T Subproject - The P&T subproject is one of the four components
of the proposed project (see para. 4.01), and is an identifiable part of the
FY79-81 three-year program. In financial terms, it represents more than 50%
of the total P&T investment for telecommunications expansion during that
period. It includes the following major features:
(a) installation of 340,000 lines of local telephone exchange
equipment of which 80,000 lines will be imported;
(b) provision of subscribers' cable and associated equipment
which will permit the connection of approximately 260,000
new DELs;



- 20 -
(c) provision of approximately 7,500 of the five-year total
of 15,000 new long-distance Public Call Offices in rural
and backward areas of the nation;
(d) extension of the automatic trunk network by the provision
of 38,000 lines of trunk exchange equipment of which
18,500 lines will be imported;
(e) provision of 2,000 lines of electronic telex switching
equipment;
(f) provision of coaxial cable line transmission equipment,
cable pressurization equipment, microwave and UHF/VHF
radio equipment, and PCM carrier systems to upgrade and
extend the trunk and junction network; and
(g)  provision of testing and laboratory equipment for the
Telecommunications Research Center, the Training Center
and the Technical and Development Circle.
4.09      The subproject is viable and balanced and made upi of a large number
of individual items which are designed and engineered in accordance with
network development plans and soundly based engineering/economic studies to
ensure least-cost solutions for the individual pieces.
4.10      P&T Subproject Costs - The cost of the P&T subprciject is set out in
detail in Annex 10 and summarized in the following table:
Rs Million                   US$ Million
-  Foreign    Local      Total    Foreign   Local   Total    %

- 21 -
4.11      The costs are based on FY77 average costs in the P&T network
insofar as local material supplies and labor rates are concerned and,
for imported equipment, on recent P&T experience based on tenders asso-
ciated with ongoing works. The estimates are reasonable. Customs duties
are included in the local costs and average about 80% on both imported
equipment and raw materials.
4.12      Contingencies - Price contingencies are based on estimated
escalation rates of 7% for 1977/78, 6.5% for 1978/79 and a flat 6.0% per
year thereafter. These figures are used on both imported and local costs
and are considered reasonable, although the GOI would hope to achieve
lower rates internally. The exception to this is that no price contingency
has been allowed for imported laboratory and testing equipment for the Tele-
communications Research Center, Workshops and Technical and Development
Circle because investment in this area, which is largely of a research and
development nature and comprises a large number and wide variety of labora-
tory instruments, is based on a three-year time slice of an ongoing program.
Price increases for individual items will be offset by deferring some pur-
chases for a few months without seriously affecting the objectives of the
program.
4.13      Physical contingencies have not been allowed as an "add on" cost
to the subproject, or the three-year program. The larger individual items
in the subproject have been designed and dimensioned in sufficient detail
to omit physical contingencies while the greater part of the subproject
cost is made up of a very large number of small items based on past average
or unit costs. In these cases, because of the basis of the estimating,
individual deviations from the estimates will balance out in the aggregate.
4.14      Items in P&T Subproject for Bank Financing - Of the US$110
million foreign exchange content of the subproject, Bank financing of
US$100 million is proposed with the GOI providing the balance of US$10
millionfrom its own resources. The allocation of the Bank loan is given
in the following table:

The Factory Subprojects
4.16      The appraisal mission included a production engineering consultant
for the purpose of reviewing the operations of the three factories and to
appraise the modernization and upgrading programs for which Bank financing
had been soug'.t. His review covered the following aspects of the factory
operations.
(i) Organization;
(ii)  Planning;
(iii) Material ordering and control;
(iv)  Work methods and productivity;
(v) Factory layout;
(vi)  Work scheduling and production control;
(vii) Quality control;
(viii) Cost control; and
(ix)  Staff relationships.
The factory subprojects were appraised in the light of the conclusions of
this review.
4.17      Some additions to the initial management programs have been agreed
and included in the subprojects discussed later in this chapter. These
additions comprised mainly improved testing and measuring equipment aimed
at improving the efficiency and quality of their testing methods. The
review also produced a number of detailed suggestions for improving their
production methods and these will be followed up during supervision missions.
As discussed in para. 3.37, the major deficiency, common to all three factories,
was found to be the lack of an effective quality assurance program. The
management of the three factories and P&T have agreed to take steps that a
suitable program will be devised and implemented. This was confirmed during
negotiations.
4.18      The procedures for determining the economic justification for
individual machine replacement in all factories were examined. It was estab-
lished that valid and detailed studies are made in arriving at the project
content, and a number of these were checked and found to be satisfactory.
The review confirmed that the factory upgrading programs are technical least-
cost solutions to maintaining and increasing production in accordance with
their objectives. The investment associated with research and development
is considered reasonable for the telecommunications manufacturing industry
in India and is based on the companies improving and developing their exist-
ing products and acquiring firsthand knowledge of modern techniques and
technologies in order to better adapt them to the Indian telecommunications
environment rather than attempting in-house development of major new tele-
communications systems.

The ITI Subproject
4.19      ITI produces step-by-step (SXS) and crossbar exchange equipment,
transmission equipment, PBX equipment, telephone instruments and miscellaneous
telecommunications equipment. The level of its output is determined largely
by the requirements of equipment to provision the P&T network expansion pro-
grams. The objective of the ITI subproject is to ensure it can maintain and
increase its outputs to meet the demands of the P&T and, in particular, to
enable the P&T subproject to be accomplished. The ITI subproject also paves
the way for production levels to meet P&T's network expansioDn beyond the
period of its three-year program.
4.20      Past and planned outputs of exchange equipment an,d telephones are
shown in the following table--the completion of the ITI subproject is related
to the outputs for FY80 through FY82 which, in turn, are baised on P&T's
requirements:
Switching Equipment (Lines)
Year  Step-by-Step  Crossbar       Total    Telephones
FY77     121,000      64,000      185,000     378,000
FY78     129,000      65,000      194,000     409,000
FY79     170,000      60,000      230,000     520,000
FY80     210,000      65,000      275,000     549,000
FY81     240,000      70,000     310,000      532,000
FY82     240,000      75,000     315,000      606,000
4.21      Switching equipment production in line with these projections are as
high as can be achieved without the establishment of a new factory and will
fall short of the P&T requirements. Direct imports by the P&T of some exchange
equipment will still be necessary to provision its programs. Production of
telephones in line with the above projections will satisfy the P&T ongoing
requirements.
4.22      The subproject also provides for an increase in the manufacture of
transmission equipment at ITI's Naini factory, and by FY82 its output will have
increased by 22% above the FY79 level. This rate of increase should keep pace
with P&T's requirements although it will remain necessary to import some
specialized microwave and transmission equipment.
4.23      The increase in production of the three main product lines and the
overall value of output as a result of the subproject are as follows:



- 25 -
Percentage
Item              FY79         FY82          Increase
Switching equipment       230,000      315,000           37%

Total Output                95.8        124.0             29%
(US$ Million)
4.24      The subproject consists of the following:
(a)  upgrading the transmission production unit at Bangalore by
the provision of modern testing and measuring equipment;
(b)  replacement of obsolete machines in the production and tool
room units and provision of modern testing equipment in the
following production divisions at Bangalore:
(i) step-by-step switching;
(ii) crossbar switching; and
(iii) telephone instruments;
(c)  expand the facilities of the microcircuit laboratory at
Baagalore;
(d)  provide increased computer capacity for production and
management control purposes at Bangalore; and
(e)  provision of modern testing equipment and minor tool room
and production machine replacement in the transmission
division at Naini.

4.25      ITI Subproject Costs - The cost of the subprojecit is Rs 203 million
(US$23.6 million) including Rs 88.8 million (US$10.3 million) foreign exchange
which is proposed for Bank lending. Details of the subproject costs are con-
tained in Annexes 11 and 12. The basis of the costs and contingency allow-
ances are discussed in paragraph 4.41.
4.26      Items in ITI Subproject for Bank Financing - The allocation of the
Bank loan is to meet the foreign exchange cost of the imported machines and
testing and measuring equipment. These are detailed in Annex 13 and can be
categorized as follows:
US$ Million
Testing and measuring equipment  :       3.5
Production and tool room machines:       4.2
Microcircuit laboratory equipment:       1.4
Computer                           :     1.2
Total                                 10.3
4.27      Procurement. disbursement and implementation are dealt with in
paragraphs 4.43 to 4.49.
The HCL Subproject
4.28      This company manufactures virtually all of the telephone cables now
used in the P&T network. It also has some capacity for the export market.
It has two factories, one at Rupnarainpur and one at Hyderabad. The latter
is modern (three to four years old), but Rupnarainpur is now approximately
20 years old and a good deal of its plant has reached the end of its economic
life.
4.29      As is the case with ITI, the cable factoriest output plans are
based on P&T's requirements for the expansion of the telecommunications network
and the subproject provides for capital equipment necessary to enable addi-
tional outputs to be achieved, and the accomplishment of the P&T subproject.
4.30      The objectives of the HCL subproject are broadly as follows:
(a) increase the output of large size telephone cables from
the Rupnarainpur factory by approximately 40% over the
period from FY79 to FY82;
(b) increase the output of small size jelly filled distribution
cable from the Hyderabad factory by more than 100% over the
same period;



- 27 -
(c) increase the output capability of small diameter coaxial
cable by 100% over the same period; and
(d)  establish a steel sheathing line for coaxial and pair
telephone cable.
4.31      The works to achieve the above objectives comprise the replacement
of cable production machines which have reached the end of their economic life,
and the provision of new machines, plant and testing instruments. Also
included is some research and development equipment mainly related to building
up some experience for future manufacture of the newly developing optical
fiber cables which are likely to play a large part in future expansion of the
P&T transmission network.
4.32      HCL Subproject Cost - The estimated cost of the subproject is Rs 164
million (US$19 million) including Rs 89 million (US$10.4 million) foreign
exchange. The amount of the foreign cost which is proposed for Bank financing
is US$7.5 million. Details of the subproject cost are contained in Annex 14.
The basis of the costs and contingency allowances are discussed in paragraph
4.41.
4.33      Items in RCL Subproject for Bank Financing - The details of items
proposed for Bank financing are shown in Annex 15.   In summary, the items may
be categorized as follows:
US$ Million
Production machines and equipment                      6.4
Testing and measuring equipment                        1.1
Total                                                7.5
4.34      Procurement, disbursement and implementation are dealt with in para-
graphs 4.43 to 4.49.
The HTL Subproject
4.35      HTL's main production line is teleprinters and miscellaneous tele-
graph, telex and data terminal equipment. It is the sole supplier of tele-
printers to the P&T and to other government entities such as Railways and the
Overseas Communications Service. In addition, it sells to business customers
and on the export market. However, its required output is largely governed
by the P&T's requirements and the objective of the HTL subproject is to
enable the factory output to be increased to match the P&T subproject and
ongoing planned requirements.



- 28 -
4.36      To meet this objective, the production capacity iEor teleprinters
must be increased from approximately 7,000 per year in FY78 to 10,000 per
year by FY83.
4.37      The subproject comprises, in the main, the replacement of worn out
and obsolete machines in the production and tool room areas of the factory.
In addition, some provision is included for testing and measuring equipment
in order to upgrade HTL's modest research and development capability. This
is necessary so as to enable it to improve its existing products and to give
it experience with modern technology applicable to the telegraph and data
field.
4.38      HTL Subproject Cost - The estimated cost of this subproject is
Rs 34.4 million (US$4 million) with a foreign exchange content of Rs 19.2
million (US$2.2 million) which is proposed for Bank lending. Details of the
costs are contained in Annex 16. The basis of the costs and contingency
allowances are discussed in paragraph 4.41.
4.39      Items in HTL Subproject for Bank Financing - Details of the items
proposed for Bank financing are included in Annex 17.   They may be
summarized as follows:
U[S$ Million
Production and tool room machines                      1.85
R&D, testing and measuring equipment                   0.35
Total                                                2.20
4.40      Procurement, disbursement and implementation are dealt with in
paragraphs 4.43 to 4.49.
Contingencies in Factory Subproject Costs (ITI, HCL and HTL)
4.41      The cost estimates in each of the three subprojects relating to the
manufacturers are based on FY77 prices and allowance has been made in both
foreign and local costs for price contingencies of 7% for FY78, 6.5% for FY79
and 6% per year for subsequent years. This is considered aidequate to fully
cover all contingencies as the subprojects have been specified in considerable
detail and provision for physical contingencies would be inappropriate.

Overall Project Cost Summary
4.42      The cost of the total project is summarized in the following
table:
Rs Millions                 US$ Millions
Subproject     Foreign   Local      Total    Foreign   Local   Total

Total        1,143.02  5,896.96  7,039.98   132.91  685.55  818.46
Bank financing of foreign costs is proposed to be to the extent of US$120
million. The remaining US$12.91 million will be financed by GOI. It
comprises US$10 million in the P&T subproject for direct import of sub-
scribers' exchange equipment and US$2.91 million in the HCL subproject
for import of a steel sheathing plant for telephone cables.
Procurement for the Project (All Four Subprojects)
4.43      The items in the P&T subproject which are to be directly imported
will be procured in accordance with the Bank's guidelines using international
competitive bidding. The machinery and test equipment to be imported by the
three domestic factories and financed by the Bank will also be procured in
the same manner.
4.44      As with previous lending operations, ICB is not proposed for the
equipment items in the P&T subproject which can be procured economically and
efficiently from the domestic factories due to the importance in telecommuni-
cations systems of this size of closely coordinated local supply of both
equipment and cables. Close coordination is particularly important for cable
provision where many sizes and wire gauges are involved and where supplies
are destined for each of thousands of individual works throughout India with-
in each program. For switching and transmission equipment, there is further
strong justification for reasons of economy, compatibility and standardization.
Bank financing in this case is limited to the foreign exchange content (raw
materials required for production) of the domestically procured goods. These
raw materials will be procured by the three factories using ICB or prudent
internatiQnal shopping as may be appropriate, in line with the Bank Group's
requirements under industrial import credits.
Disbursement for the Project
4.45      In the case of the P&T project, disbursement of Bank funds would be
made against foreign costs of the imported equipment and raw materials for the
P&T workshops. In the case of P&T purchases from the local factories, dis-
bursement would be made against invoices to the P&T of a calculated percentage

of the purchase price representing the foreign exchange content of the
goods supplied for the subproject. These percentages are currently
estimated as follows for purchases from:
ITI:  25% of the selling price;
HCL:  36% of the selling price; and
HTL:   6% of the selling price.
In the case of HCL, the percentage has been calculated taking into account
the use in cable manufacture of scrap copper supplied by P&T. The per-
centages would be subject to review and revised if necessary due to changing
conditions.

be made against foreign costs of the directly imported items of equipment.

Implementation
4.48      In the case of the P&T subproject, all installation work will be
carried out by the P&T which has a large and competent staff of engineers,
technicians and tradesmen. Most of the subproject comprises work and equip-
ment on which the P&T staff are experienced and no problems with the con-
struction work are envisaged. Its implementation will be monitored by its
outputs in terms of physical targets as detailed in Annex 7. The subproject
includes some works, notably electronic exchanges, which are new and which
will require special attention by P&T and careful monitoring by Bank to
achieve the following schedule:
Issue tender documents:  June 1978 l/
Receive bids           : October 1978
Evaluation report      : January 1979
Bank agreement         : February 1979
Contract placed        : March 1979
Delivery commenced    : March 1980
Installation commenced:  May 1980
Delivery complete      : December 1980
Installation complete:  April/June 1981
4.49      No problems are foreseen in implementing the factory subprojects.
All factory managements include competent engineers and technical staff and
have experienced procurement and installation groups. Each company has
prepared a detailed three-year implementation plan for phasing in the new and
replacement equipment in an orderly manner. Accommodation for the new items
of plant is available.
1/ Tenders for electronic exchange equipment to be funded under the sixth
telecommunications project have been framed in a manner that allows
additional equipment for this proposed subproject to be purchased as
an option.

V. FINANCES
Background
5.01      P&T keeps separate accounts for its telecommunications and postal
operations. For its Telecommunications Branch, P&T maintains commercial
accrual accounts in addition to the conventional Government cash accounts.
These commercial accounts, which are subject to external audit and are
presented to parliament, are the basis for the financial data presented in
this report. (See paragraph 3.18).
5.02      P&T is a department of government and its budget forms a part
of the national budget. All of its funds are paid into the central govern-
ment's consolidated fund, and all funds made available to P&T are through
parliamentary appropriation. Funds which are provided by Government in
excess of P&T's internal generation are called capital-at-charge and the
Government requires that the Branch pay an annual interest on these funds
at the rate of 6%. For presentation in this report capital-at-charge has
been segregated between that obtained from long-term extiernal financing
(classified as Long-term Debt) and that obtained from Government (classified
as Equity Contribution).
Past Operations
5.03      The Branch's operating results during the fiscal years 1975
through 1977 have been satisfactory and rates of return on net assets in
operations have been 19.0%, 16.3% and 29.0%, respectively. However, these
rates of return have been computed on an original cost asset base and, as
such, might not be entirely realistic (see paragraph 5.08). The operating
ratio during this period, again based on original cost depreciation, varied
from 55% to 72% which is acceptable. Other financial indicators reflect
a very acceptable financial performance with current ratios of at least
3.1 times; debt-equity ratios of no more than 24/76 and an internal cash
generation during the period of 56% of the fund requirement after covering
debt services and postal losses. Detailed financial statements for the
1975-83 period are shown in Annex 19 and Annex 20.
Present Financial Position
5.04      The actual financial position at March 31, 1977, and the estimated
financial position at March 31, 1978, are summarized below:

5.06      Transfers are made from the Telecommunications ]Branch's profits
to cover losses of the Postal Branch. The Government wouLd prefer to have
the Postal Branch operate at a profit but supports the present loss opera-
tion as a necessary condition to the provision of this basic service to
the rural areas. The Government, by maintaining telecommunication's
tariffs at a level higher than that necessary to support telecommunications
operation, makes possible this fund transfer to the Posta:L Branch without
damaging the Telecommunications Branch's ability to meet iLts financial
requirements. The loss of P&T Postal Branch's operations is expected to
increase at a rate of about 20% per year and transfers to cover this loss
will result in a distribution of over 30% of the Telecommtmications Branch's
profit during the project period. Government however recognizes this Tele-
communication contribution to the Postal Services by accruing interest at a
rate of 6% per annum on the cumulative transfer of funds f-rom the Telecom-
munications Branch to the Postal Branch.
5.07      In recognition of this situation, the above financing plan for
the 1979-81 fiscal period determines net internal cash generation after
deduction of postal transfers as well as the conventional debt servicing.



- 35 -
Even under this basis, the Telecommunications Branch will be able to
internally generate 69% of its fund requirement--an excellent performance.
The Branch will obtain the remainder of its requirement from borrowing
(19%), Government contribution (5%) and subscriber deposits (7%). The
borrowings inc'ude undisbursed portion of IBRD Loan 1313-IN (2%), expected
bilateral loans (3%), the proposed US$100 million Bank loan (6%) and bor-
rowing relating to the financing of future development programs beyond
the project period but within the three-year fiscal period (8%). The
requirement for a Government equity contribution is small, particularly
considering the large lump sum investment for the domestic satellite
system whose fund requirement is Rs 840 million more than the Rs 754
million total Government contribution.
Revaluation of Assets
5.08      Under previous agreements with the Bank Group, the Telecommuni-
cations Branch is required to review the value of its net fixed assets in
operation at least every five years and determine whether it is necessary
to adjust the value to reflect current prices. The Branch is still con-
sidering the pros and cons of alternative methodologies for revaluation of
assets. In the absence of a reliable and complete revaluation of the
Branch assets, a trial valuation was made in the course of appraisal using
India's Wholesale Price Index which in recent years has moved along broadly
in step with other available indices of manufacturing costs of telecommuni-
cations equipment and components. On this basis, the current value of the
Telecommunications Branch's net assets in operation would be about 56%
higher than the book value although if allowance for improved efficiency
of new techniques were to be made, the increase in the book value would be
lower. During negotiations the methodology for revaluation and periodic
updatings thereafter was further discussed, and P&T agreed to complete
the revaluation of its Telecommunications Branch assets by March 31, 1980.
The previous agreements also provide that the minimum 11% annual rate of
return, and minimum average rate of depreciation of 4-1/2% on gross value
of assets to be used in determining expenses for the rate of return calcu-
lated, will be reviewed by the Government and the Bank to determine
whether any adjustments are called for. However, until the revaluation is
completed it will not be possible to determine whether this rate of return
has been achieved. While retaining the existing covenant, it was therefore
agreed with the Government that until revaluation is completed telecommuni-
cations earnings will be maintained at a level sufficient to enable the
Telecommunications Branch to provide each year from its own operations at
least 60% of its annual capital expenditures. The forecasts for FYs79-83
indicate that such contribution to capital requirement would be achieved
with the present tariffs unchanged and would be equivalent to a rate of
return of about 13% on revalued assets, on the assumption of a 56% increase
in the book value at the end of FY78 and an annual escalation of 5% thereafter.



- 36 -
5.09      The Branch also tends, as a part of the asset valuation review
to redetermine the economic life of its assets and the related deprecia-
tion rates. Depreciation is currently based on the origin,al costs of the
asset plus "supplementary depreciation" which is not credited to Accumulated
Depreciation, but is applied to the Income Statement to reflect the effect
of inflation on the asset accounts. The composite rate of depreciation
produced by the combination of these two methods to average plant in
operations was (during the fiscal years 1975-78) about 4%. This composite
rate is low by international standards and less than the 4-1/2% anticipated
by Loan Agreement 1313-IN (Schedule 5.2(a) (ii)). P&T intends to review
the depreciation rates during the asset valuation review.
Future Operations
5.10      Forecast Income Statements for the fiscal years 1979-83 and
Statements of Financial Position at March 31, 1979-83 are shown in Annexes
19 and 20.    Notes to these financial statements are in Annex 22.
5.11      The Forecast Income Statements reflect the application of a 4-1/2%
composite depreciation rate to the average original cost asset value and the
crediting of the entire depreciation to the Accumulated Depreciation on the
Statements of Financial Position. As an addendum to the Income Statement,
a calculation has been made showing the rate of return after applying the
Indian Wholesale Price Index to the net asset value and the computation of
depreciation at 4-1/2% on this revalued base. A summary of the operating
results and various significant financial indexes for 1979-83 fiscal period

5.12      Revenues and operating expenses have been projected in accordance
with past experience and the projected increase in telephone connections and
other facilities. Operating expenses reflect projected increases in staff
and include an inflation factor of 5% per annum in accordance with the
recent inflationary trends in India.
5.13      The forecast earnings produce rates of return on the estimate of
revalued net plant in operations for the Telecommunications Branch of 15%
in 1979, 14.3% in 1980 and 13.7% in 1981 based on the existing tariff. The
gradual decline of the rate of return is due to the large size of the invest-
ment program and the lag in the full utilization of the new facilities.  The
operating ratio remains constant at about 60. Both of these results would
be satisfactory.
5.14      Branchts financial position remains strong throughout the project
period with debt-equity ratios of no more than 23/77 current ratios of at
least 2.9 times and debt services and postal transfer coverage of at least
3.7.
Domestic Manufacturers
5.15      The three indigenous telecommunications equipment suppliers ITI,
HCL and HTL which supply P&T with the major portion of its equipment require-
ments were found to be satisfactorily managed and operated at a reasonable
profit level. The bulk of their sales are to P&T at prices which assure
an acceptable profit based on the estimated production volume. ITI's agree-
ment with P&T provides for a profit margin on sales of 10%. HCL agreement
also calls for a similar profit level but provides for a credit for recovered
copper made available by P&T. HTL's agreement with P&T is based on estimated
cost plus a profit of about 15%. All three companies are audited annually by
commercial firms of chartered accountants. During negotiations it was agreed
to continue this practice and to provide the Bank with copies of these audit
reports within six months of the end of each fiscal year. A summary of the
results of their operation for the fiscal years 1975-77 and their financial
position at March 31, 1975-77 appears in Annex 23.
5.16      Indian Government has followed the practice of charging industrial
entities a rate of interest of 10.25% for all Government funds made available
for their use. During negotiations agreement was reached that the Bank loan
funds be onlent to ITI, HCL and HTL in accordance with this practice making
the terms of the onlending 15 years including grace periods of three years.
Performance Indicators
5.17      Performance indicators to help monitor the Branch's future per-

VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
6.01      The new five-year Telecommunications Program from which the present
project has been derived is fundamentally a part of the GOI's National Five-Year
Development Plan. The project encompasses the entire sector from raw materials
and capital improvement for factory expansion to additional telecommunications
services for final consumers.
Telecommunications and DevelopnAent
6.02      In India there is-a large and growing unsatisfied demand for tele-
communications services which is unlikely to be met in the foreseeable future
(para. 2.04). Given this situation, the GOI is paying incrieasing attention to
how the limited resources allocated to the telecommunications sector are used.
During the 1979-83 planning period this means that the priority areas for invest-
ment will be in rural and smaller district centers, and in ithose portions of the
large metropolitan areas in which there is a large OYT demand.
6.03      The 15,000 additional rural PCOs, the 2,300 additional small rural
exchanges, and the approximately 700,000 new DELs allocated to district centers
and cities other than Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi and Madras should help facilitate
the achievement of government's goals of stimulating economic development out-
side of the major metropolitan areas, encouraging decentralization, and reducing
transport and communication-related costs in a wide spectrum of economic and
social sectors. In particular, the provision of services related to agriculture
extension work and to health, welfare, and education in rural areas involves,
in many cases, use of staff with limited expertise who can benefit by obtaining
direction and advice over the telephone from more qualified personnel at main
centers.
6.04      The priority provision of lines in those specific service areas of the
largest cities in which there is the greatest OYT demand should help assure that
potential large business and government subscribers who will derive the highest
returns from telephone usage will be able to gain access to the system.
The Distribution of Benefits
6.05      The distribution of the benefits from the proposed project should touch
all segments of the population in India. Indirectly, government administration
and private business should incur communication-related efficiency increases, or
lower costs, since telecommunications is the least cost means of communication
for a wide variety of economic and social welfare activities. A more direct
impact will be felt by the high priority business and commercial OYT waiters and
by the general lower income population in rural and backward areas. As a result
of the emphasis on investment outside of the larger metropolitan areas, a major
improvement in quality of service will be made in smaller cities and district
centers, while in smaller towns and villages almost 60 million people will
receive local public access to telephone facilities for the first time.



- 39 -
6.06      Finally, the Telecommunications Branch of P&T has a much wider impact
on the communications and other sectors in India than is apparent from tele-
phone statistics. For example, the universal access postal service receives a
transfer of funds from the Telecommunications Branch sufficient to cover postal
losses. In 1977 over 19% of the total capital and operating costs of the Postal
Branch of P&T was covered out of telecommunications revenues. Overall during
the 1979-83 period Government will receive from the Telecommunications Branch
a net of Rs 9,231 million. Telecommunications Branch transfers to and from
Government will be as follows:
(Rs millions)
Funds Flowing to Government
Transfers to Postal Branch             5,282
Customers duties                       3,996
Debt services                          1,608
10,886
Funds Flowing to Branch
Interest payments                      1,629
Capital contributions (net)             _ 26
1,655
Net Funds to Government                  9,231
Pricing Policies
6.07      Given the scarcity of resources allocated to the telecommunications
sector in India, pricing policy is another means by which the benefits of the
sector can be focused on high priority users. Currently, the pricing mechanism
is used to control access to, and priority usage of, the system. If sufficient
lines are allocated to high OYT areas, the advance deposit OYT scheme can pro-
vide a "safety valve" for those business and commercial interest which make the
most productive use of telephone service. Also, during peak congestion daytime
hours, long distance calls can be booked as regular long distance calls at
regular daytime long distance rates, as urgent long distance calls at twice the
regular charge, as immediate priority calls at four times the regular charge,
and as lightning priority calls at eight times the regular charge.
6.08      Pricing policy is further used to promote cheaper local service for
those residing outside of the larger urban areas. Both the required OYT and
regular advance deposits, and the monthly telephone rental charges are generally
less in the smaller telephone service areas.
6.09      Additional proposals for tariff restructuring designed to promote the
efficiency and equity benefits of telephone investment in India have been
discussed with P&T. Management at P&T, with input from the newly formed
Economic Cell, is considering several of these including a possible increasing
block call charge designed to influence network traffic congestion in the four
largest metropolitan areas. The Bank pursued possible approaches to changes
in tariff structure at the time of negotiations and will follow up during
project supervision mission.



- 40 -
Least Cost Solution
6.10      The individual works which comprise the project are derived from
development plans which are soundly based. Telecommunications network planning
is based on engineering and economic studies designed to optimize the location
and timing for new subscribers and trunk exchanges. Extensions to existing
exchanges, cable and transmission equipment are dimensioned using standard
analytical techniques to ensure optimum provisioning periods considering both
economies of scale and the cost of money.
6.11      The capital expansion of the factories is designed to ensure the
production of equipment for P&T at least cost.  Among the specific advantages of
expanding the telecommunications manufacturing industry in India are the following:
(a)  increased opportunity for standardization which reduces
training, installation and maintenance costs;
(b) compatability of equipment facilitating extension of plant
by equipment of the same design and manufacture;
(c) reduction of lead time between demand and supply;
(d) increased reliability of supplies;
(e) increased facility to adapt design to meet special
network requirements;
(f) increased feedback of network performance and maintenance
experience to manufacturers;
(g) increased flexibility in modifying manufacturing sch,edules
to meet unexpected changes in reauirements; and
(h) increased liaison between P&T research, planning, installa-
tion and maintenance groups and manufacturers' research,
development and production groups.
Return on Investment
6.12      The internal financial rate of return-on the telecommunications
investment program defined as the discount rate which equalizes the stream of
expected revenues attributable to the program with capital and operating costs
is 20% (Annex 25).   Sensitivity analysis shows that under the most unfavorable
combination of main parameters (increase of 10% each in capital and operating
costs, 10% decrease in revenues and a two-year delay in program completion) the
rate of return would not be less than 14%. Shadow pricing foreign exchange at
Rs 10 = US$1 and labor at 70% of the market wage rate gives an economic rate
of return of 22%.
6.13      The above calculation of the internal rate of return reflects a sig-
nificant understatement of total program benefits since it is based only on the



- 41 -
overall measurable average willingness of subscribers to pay for telecommunica-
tion services. As such, it does not reflect estimates of the consumer surplus
which callers receive; a portion of the benefits accruing to receivers of calls;
many of the benefits received by other subscribers when additional subscribers
join the system; and most of the indirect benefits received by all through the
better administration of rural development, health, transport and agricultural
programs and the increases in rural and urban business and government efficiency.
6.14      Benefits are also understated because, while the costs included in
calculating the internal rate of return are those for extending the network and
providing facilities in the newly served rural areas now, the full benefits are
not included because the available capacity of various components of equipment
will only be fully utilized when additional investment is made in the future.
Thus, costs incurred in the program will generate undeterminable benefits in
future programs.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS BRANCH
Broad Objectives of 6th Five-Year Plan (FYs79-83)
As Stated by Government of India
1.        The Telecommunications Branch will play its full part in the develop-
ment of rural and semi-urban areas and will aim to generally provide all tele-
phone connections that may be required with a minimum of waiting time, in
support of the Government's efforts for developing the economies in these
areas.
2.        The Telecommunications Branch will extend its services into the
rural areas by a phased program of opening of public call offices in accordance
with the liberalized policy already announced in this regard. The Branch will
work to a target of 15,000 PCOs during the plan period. A significant portion
of these will be in tribal and hilly areas for which spec:ific funds amounting
to Rs 375 million (US$43.6 million) will be set aside.
3.        During the plan period, the Telecommunications Branch will work to a
target of 1.15 million DELs being added in the country.  Out of these, an
adequate number will be provided in rural areas, smaller towns and new growth
centers to meet their requirements as far as possible on demand.
4.        The Telecommunications Branch will undertake a modest program of
conversion of manual exchanges to automatic spreading the program over a larger
number of years than the original target of eliminating manual working by 1986.
It will absorb 100,000 lines of manual exchange equipment for expansion of
existing exchanges, PBXs, etc., during the plan period.
5.        The Telecommunications Branch will undertake a modest program of
replacement of old automatic exchange equipment reaching the end of its useful
life, spreading this program also over a larger number of years than envisaged
during the Fifth Plan.
6.        The Telecommunications Branch will provide high-grade, reliable
large capacity transmission media between important regional and sub-regional
centers up to the secondary levels through internal satellite as well as
terrestrial microwave, UHF, VHF, and cable media.
7.        The Telecommunications Branch will extend the automatization of the
trunk switching by expanding existing and installing new TAXs, point-to-point
STD routes and single and multi link operator dialing facilities to ensure as
early as possible:

(a) STD from all state capitals to Delhi;
(b) STD or "On Demand" service through single or multi-link
operator dialing from all district headquarters to the
respective state headquarters;
(c) STD or "On Demand" service through operator dialing to
Delhi from all district headquarters within 300 kms and
to Calcutta, Bombay and Madras from all district head-
quarters within 200 kms respectively; and
(d) STD from industrial and trade centers of national importance
in the hinterland to Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta and Madras
respectively.
8.        The Telecommunications Branch will improve the trunk service
through more open wire carrier, etc., In rural and semi-urban areas below
the secondary switching centers level.
9.        The Telecommunications Branch will provide telex connections on
demand to the extent possible all over the country.
10.       The plan will provide for adequate equipment, machinery and manpower
support, etc., to step up the research projects in the Telecommunications
Research Center, improve and develop the training facilities, make the
testing and quality control organizations more effective and step up the

Note to Financial Statements
1. Income Statement
1.01      Telephone Revenues have been forecast based on the average number of
DELs estimated to be in service during the fiscal year at the experienced
average revenue per DEL stimulated at a rate of seven percent per annum during
1979 to 1981 and at six percent and five percent for the years 1982 and 1983,
respectively. Recent experience shows the rate of increase in average revenue
per DEL at nine percent, thus suggesting that this stimulation might be
conservative.
1.02      Telegraph Revenues have been projected to increase at a rate of five
percent per year based on recent experience.
1.03      Telex Revenues have been forecast to increase at 15 percent per
annum. During the 1978-83 period, new connections will be about 1,800 (or ten
percent of the existing 17,000 subscribers). An additional five percent
increase reflects expected traffic growth.
1.04      Service to Railways Revenues have been projected at a flat rate of
Rs 130 per year reflecting 1976-78 experience. The Railways have been building
their own communications system and significant revenue increases in this area
are unlikely.
1.05      Miscellaneous Revenues reflecting advertisement receipts, telephone
directory sales, etc., are estimated to grow conservatively at Rs 2 million per year.
1.06      Staff Expenses and Other Costs of Operation have been forecast to
grow at about 15 percent per year. This 15 percent represents ten percent for
increases in the number of staff--which actually are estimated at 10.1% for
1979, 11.1% for 1980, 10.8% for 1981, 9.0% for 1982 and 7.5% for 1983--and 5%
for inflation based on data provided by P&T's economist.
1.07      Depreciation has been computed on a straight-line basis at a composite
rate of 4.5%. The forecast income statement reflects this computation on the
original cost of the assets in operation. However, in an addendum to the
income statement, the net operation income has been adjusted to reflect
depreciation on revalued assets utilizing the Indian Wholesale Price index to
revalue the asset base.

1.08      Other Income (Interest Income) reflects computations made by
Government to compensate P&T for transfer of funds to cover postal service
losses and for funds held by Government. The interest rate utilized for
these computations is the experienced 6%.
1.09      Interest Expense is projected based on India's 8method where total
debt servicing (interest and amortization) is 6% of the capital-at-charge
and the exchange loss is transferred to Government. This makes this account-
ing treatment coincide with that utilized for the Railways.
2. Statement of Financial Position
2.01      Fixed Assets reflects the investment program deltailed in Annex 8.
2.02      Net Plant in Service is shown at original cost Less accumulated
depreciation calculated at a rate of 4-1/2% during the 1979-83 period.
2.03      Plant Under Construction has been calculated at 50% of the total
of that year's construction program plus the plant under construction value
at the end of the previous year.
2.04      Customer Accounts Receivable have been estimated at 18% of tele-
phone billings reflecting P&T goal of 58-day revenue valuation plus a small
amount of old accounts which have not been written off.
2.05      Inventories have been calculated at 7% of the value of plant based
on past experience.
2.06      Current Liabilities have been calculated at 11% of cash expenditures
for operating expenses and construction based on past experience.
2.07      Other Liabilities consist of advance deposits by OYT subscribers and
other subscribers. The OYT deposits are applied against billings over a period
of 20 years.
