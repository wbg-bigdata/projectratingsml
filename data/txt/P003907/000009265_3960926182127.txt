MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO INDONESIA
FOR A FORESTRY INSTITUTIONS AND CONSERVATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Indonesia for US$34 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be for 20 years including five years of grace at the
standard variable interest rate, and would help finance a forestry institu-
tions and conservation project.
2.        Background.  Indonesian forests are extensive, covering an area
variously estimated at 100 to 144 million ha, or about 55 to 80Z of
Indonesia's land area. Forestry products, the most valuable non-oil export,
account for 20X of such exports. With the rapid development of wood
processing industries, Indonesia has become the world's biggest hardwood
plywood exporter. However the sustainability of these exports is being
questioned. Weak forestry sector planning, management and conservation
practices are causing accelerated depletion of forest resotrces. The out-of-
date forestry resource information has created a perception of limitless
resources, leading to virtually uncontrolled exploitation of forests and their
conversion for agricultural and settlement programs. This has serious
implications for economically and environmentally sustainable forest
production and conservation.
3.        The most significant institutional constraints are. (a) lack of a
realistic forestry managment plan and development/exploitation strategy;
(b) iuadequately trained and experienced Ministry of Forests staff to evolve
and implement them; (c) unreliable forest inventory information; (d) inade-
quate research for Outer Island conditions, where most natural forests are
situated; and (e) inadequate programs for nature and watershed conservation.
Recognizing these deficiencies, Indonesia has already designated about 49 mil-
lion ha of the forest area for conservation and protection purposes, created a
Ministry of Forests (MOF) in 1983, and is now reviewing concession arrange-
ments. GOl's increasing environmental concerns, reflected in its desire to
systematically discuss such issues with donors at the next IGGI meeting,
confirms its receptivity for making changes in the manasement of the forestry
sector. The proposed project would support and build on GOI's important
initiatives.
4.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  A strong forestry sub-sector is
important to the economy because of its role in export earnings and environ-
mental protection. The Bank's agricultural and rural development strategy,
largely concentrated to date on irrigation, tree crop and transmigration
activities, has clearly revealed their sensitive inter-relationships with the
forestry sector. There is an increasing need to view agriculturaL development
and settlement matters within a broad natural resource management framework.
The proposed project, which would be the firsc Bank-assisted forestry project
in Indonesia, provides an opportunity for the Bank to help GOI forge the
institutional and technical linkages necessary for more balanced and



environmentally-sound development of forest resources, and complements on-
going UNDP/FAO assistance for strengthening of forestry planning. Through the
proposed support for conservation oriented investments, the project would also
provide an avenue for implementing the Bank's policy to encourage environmen-
tal protection at4 conservation measures in Indonesia.
5.        Prol*2ct Objectives.  The primary objective of this first Bank-
assisted project would be to strengthen planning, management and conservation
efforts in this sector for maximizing long-term contributions from forest
resources. This will increase understanding of the sector and prepare the
foundation for future development which the Bank may support through
subsequent forestry projects. Another major objective would be to address
critical conservation needs which should not be postponed because of the
danger of an irreversible loss of productive lands, and some of Indonesia'b
most valuable and threatened nature reserves.
6.        Project Description.  The proposed project would first, strengthen
forestry planning and management by: (a) developing appropriate strategies
for forest management including policies and incentives for sustainable
management of natural forest and plantation development where appropriate, and
for limiting the more destructive forms of shifting cultivation while ensuring
the welfare of local people; (b) strengthening forestry research through
improved planning, management and funding of adaptive research; (c) streng-
thening information for sectoral planning, through a forest inventory focusiud
on priority areas for forestry development; (d) improving sectoral manpower
development planning and training capacity; and (e) preparing investment
projects consistent with sectoral strategy recommendations. Second, it would
improve watershed conservation measures in the Upper Solo (Wonogiri) watershed
in Central Java. considered to be the aost critical watershed in Indonesia
because of erosion and high population density; this would include rehabilita-
tion of 22,000 ha of terraces and construction of associated conservation
structurest planting 5,000 ha of community forests on private lands, estab-
lishment of 3,500 ha of conservation oriented forests on state land, and
strengthening of associated administrative infrastructure in this watershed.
And third, it would strengthen management of five existing nature conservation
areas7,including buffer zone development to preclude expl-itation by local
inhabitants and technical assistance for developing modelL for nation-wide
replication to preserve such areas on a viable basis.
7.        The project is estimated to cost about US$63 million, including US$4
million in duties and taxes. The proposed Bank loan of US$34 million equiva-
lent will finance 60X of project cost (net of duties, taxes and reserved
procurement), and would cover costs of civil works, soil conservation terrace
improvements, equipment, aerial photographs, maps, research, nursery, field
trials incremental operating costs, technical assistance, and training. The
Government of Netherlands intends to provide a grant of about US$3 million
equivalent for the proposed project. Local contribution, net of duties and
taxes, will be US$22 million, of which GOI will contribute US$15 million and
farmer in-kind contribution will be US$10 million. Retroactive financing of
up to US$0.5 million of expenditures incurred after July 1, 1987 would be
required for some start-up activities. A breakdown of project costs and
financing plan is in Schedule A, and procurement and disbursement in Schedule

B. A time-table of key processing events is shown in Schedule C, and the
Status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia is given in Schedule D. A map is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7002-IND dated February 19,
1988, is being distributed separately.
8.        Actions Agreed.  The Government's agreement to the following actions
was confirmed during negotiations: (a) TORs and implementation responsibili-
ties for all consultancy and technical assistance, along with time-tables for
implementing them; (b) formulation of broad research priorities and programs
consistent with sectoral needs and budget availability; (c) implementation of
viable institutional and management plans for nature conservation areas;
(d) strengthening co-ordination mechanisms for watershed conservation; and
(e) allocation of sufficient counterpart funds. The Government has invited
proposals for forestry management strategy studies and for the forest
inventory study from FAO and has agreed to sign contracts prior to loan
effectiveness. Other requirements incorporated in the draft loan agreement
include: (a) hiring of consultants for research, and watershed and nature
conservation prior to disbursement on the respective components; (b) prior
review and agreement by the Bank of the detailed annual research programs; and
(c) issuance of an Action Plan and implementation schedule incorporating the
forest management strategy study recommendations, acceptable to the Bank, by
March 31, 1991.
9.        Benefits.  Economic benefits are expected from:  (a) improved fores-
try management leading to a sustained longer-term production from the forestry
sector; (b) improved investment planning leading to more efficient and higher
levels of output and incomes from the sector and better sustenance of the
natural environment including the protection of important species of fauna and
flora; and (c) improved soil conservation leading to (i) increased
agricultural production for about 50,000 farm-families (most of whom are below
the poverty level) and (ii) longer reservoir life and lower irrigation O&M
costs in Wonogiri. Watershed conservation activities will have an ERR of
about 22Z.
10.       Risks.  The main project risk would be implementation delays due to
counterpart budget constraints. This risk has been reduced by obtaining GOI
agreement to counterpart funding requirements and by arranging cofinancing on
grant terms. Another risk could be delays in hiring of consultants and in
implementing recommendations of strategy studies. The risk has been reduced
by agreeing with GOI on study TORs duting appraisal, by requiring hiring of
consultants for major studies before loan effectiveness, by involving GOI
fully in carrying out the study, and by linking future Bank assistance to
satisfactory implementation wf study recommendations.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
