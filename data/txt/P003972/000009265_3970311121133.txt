MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INIERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO TBE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH MANAGEMET II PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Indonesia for US$63.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be for twenty years, including five years of grace, at the Badk's
standard variable interest rate, and would help finance a Second riricultural Research
Management Project.
2.    Country/Sector Background. Agricultural development in Indonesia has been
impressive during the past two decades. Agricultural growth averaged about 3.8 percent
annually. Self-sufficiency was achieved in rice production and there has been significant
reduction in poverty, although many farmers remain close to the poverty line. Agriculture
contributes about 18 percent of overall gross domestic product (GDP), employs some
50 percent of the labor force, and accounts for 26 percent of non-oil exports in foreign
exchange earnings. Economic growth is expected to generate a more diversified pattern
of food demand, with declining consumption of traditional staples and increasing demand
for income-elastic foods, such as meat and other preferred foods. Shiffing world markets
for export commodities add a dimension of uncertainty to the direction of future
agricultural growth. The government's present five-year development plan (Repelita VI)
envisages 3.4 percent per annum agricultural GDP growth, which represents an increase of
0.5 percent compared to the previous pLun, (Repelita V).
3.    With the implementation of Repelita VI and the Second Long-Term Development
Plan in 1994, the Govermment's agricultural objectives have shifted from production
targets te increasing farmers' productivity, incomes, and welfare. The new strategy
focLses on the development of commercial fanning, agribusiness, and agro-industries in
rural areas, with greater private sector involvement, as a means of increasing farmers'
incomes and augmenting value-added 'within the region. Along with the major goal of
poverty reduction, increased emphasis will be accorded to regional development.
Consistent with the increasing role of private investment, Repe3ita VI projects a contiing
decline in the share of public investment allocated to directy productive activities, leaving
them increasingly to the private sector.  However, despite the declining share in
government development speding, govremment expenditure programs remain important
in agriculure, a sector that still provides livelihood to the majority of Indonesians and will
continue to play a key role in poverty reduction. The focus of the Government's
investment in the sector will, therefore, continue to shift from direct involvement in
production programs to provision of well-designed support services, such as extension and
research. Research and development (R&D) will emphasie support for regional
activities, especially in lesser developed parts of the country. Emphasis will be on efficient
use of resources,  income generation, poverty alleviation, and diversification of
production.

4.    Agricultural Research and Development  A Presidential Decree in 1974
authorized the establishment of research and development agencies in the several
departments and ministries of government. The agency created for agriculture was the
Agency for Agricultural Research and Development (AARD). In carrying out its various
tasks and functions, AARD was supported by some 40 research establishments, 64
laboratories, 57 substations, and 150 experimental ponds and farms. AARD has grown
from a small agency to one with over 2,400 scientists, of which more than 650 have MSc
and over 240 have PhD degrees. Budgetary support for agriculural R&D in Indonesia
has fluctuated. Although it has increased since 1989, Indonesia still lags behind other
countries in Asia in agricultural R&D expenditures.
5.    Since its establishment in 1974, AARD has undergone four reorganizations (1979,
1983, 1990 and 1994) to adapt to the changing demnands of the country's agicultural
sector and national development programs. The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), of which
AARD is a part, will increasingly focus on fostering private sector development and
providing public services such as research, extension, and rural infrastructure. This will
require improving its institutional capacity to ensure that public-service fimctions are
client-responsive and performed efficiently by the various public agencies, including
AARD. In addition, MOA and AARD need to idenftil areas where the private sector can
take on increasing responsibilities for research. R&D has contributed significantly to the
impressive performnuce of the agricultural sector. Future R&D activities will have to take
into account changes such as: (a) decentralization of government services and greater
regionalization of R&D to focus on specific agroecological zones (AEZs) and resource-
based development, and generation of location-specific technologies; and (b) emphasis on
market-oriented and demand-driven technologies to serve changing needs of consumers
for higher quality and diversified products.
6.    Lessons from Previous Bank Experience. A major lesson learned during the
Banr.'s long association with research projects is that it takes time to build research
capacity and for institutional changes to evolve to improve research efficiency and cost-
effectiveness. The successfil organization of re3earch for managing technological change
depends, on flexibility, good communications, small interdisciplinary teams of researchers,
rewards for excellence and accommodation of failures, accountability, beneficiary
participation, and step-wise innovations. For Indonesia, other lessons show that: (a) a
decentralized R&D system, with strong linkages to local govenmment and other institutions
through improved coordination mechanisms, is needed to fully tap available local
resources, and (b) farming-systems research, emphasizing location-specific and on-arm
activities, should be institutionalized in major agroecological regions, with particular
attention to socio-economic conditions in rural communities.
7.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank has strongly supported agricultural
R&D in Indonesia since 1975. The Bark's long and close association with agricultural
research in Indonesia, as a major donor, places it in an excellent position to provide fiuther
assistance and coordination of other donors' support to make agricultural research more
cost-effective. The Project is filly consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy
for Indonesia which was discussed by the Board of Executive Directors on March 21,



-3 -
1995 and focuses, inter alia, on inter-regional equity and enhanced competitiveness,
delivery of higher quality public services, especially to the poor, greater decentralization of
responsibilities, and improved environmental management. The project would support
greater decentralization of responsibilities for agricultural research and technology
transfer, strengthen local institutions and human resources in order to effectively develop,
disseminate and apply location-specific technologies, thereby enhancing competitiveness,
provide improved public services to lower income rural communities, and improve
enviromnental management by developing and promoting sustainable agricultural
practices.
8.    Project Objectives. The overall objective of the Project will be to strengthen
regional R&D in support of agricultural development, ensuring the location-specificity of
technology, emphasizing the development of market-oriented and client-driven technology
packages, and facilitating delivery of the research results to technology users. In support
of thi- objective, the Project will improve R&D management at the regional level; conduct
national level research in priority areas in support of regional R&D; and strengthen
national, regionaL, and international collaboration in research and technology development.
Major focus will be on support for the phased establishment and operationalization of a
network of Assessment Institutes for Agricultural Technology (AIATs) with a mandate to
carry out resource-based, fimer-participatory, location-specific, farming systems-oriented
adaptive research; facilitate technology transfer; and provide feedback to researchers, with
emphasis on decentralized planning, management, and decision-making.
9.    Project Description. The project, which will be implemented in two overlapping
five-year phases over six years, will have four components:
(a)   Regionalization of Agricultural R&D (estimated total cost US$53.8
million). This component will screngthen on-farm research using firming
systems methodology and facilitate technology transfer in eight
agroecological regions. The Project will support the establishment and
operation of eight priority AIATs in 12 provinces in a new regional
network of 17 AIATs being established by the MOA. The capability of
staff in the eight AIATs will be improved and their linkages will be
strengthened by enhancing collaboration and participation of local
institutions in regional R&D activities. The eight ALATs will test and assist
in the dissemination of technologies needed in specific farming systems in
the selected AEZs.
(b)   Institutionalization of R&D Management at the Regional Level
(estimated total cost US$17.8 million). This cormponent will introduce
administrative and management reforms developed under the ARM Project
at the regional level. It will support common administrafion and
management procedures in the 17 AIATs in the network while GOI, with
possible assistance from other donors, will establish the remaining nine
AIATs in the network. These new procedures would ensure bottom-up
planning and improved priority setting and resource allocation.



(c)   Support to Priority Commodity and Discipline-Oriented Research
(estimated total cost US$22.2 million).   This component will help
accelerate the development of new technologies and improve the relevance
of research conducted by commodity research institutes by getting them to
backstop the needs of the ALATs. The Project will support priority
commodity and discipline-oriented research, particularly on livestock
horticulture and plantation crops, fisheries, and in selected disciplines like
biotechnology, agricultural engineering, agribusiness and marketing, post
harvest and processing, and sociology/anthropology.
(d)   Strengthening R&D Collaboration (estimated total cost US$8.0 million).
This component will improve Indonesia's access to internationally
generated technologies, tools and methodologies (i.e., farming systems,
social and gender analysis, strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation),
by improving collaboration with Asian-Pacific and international research
centers, other Asian-Pacific national agricultural research systems, and
selected foreign universities. It will also strengthen collaboration between
the AARD Work Units and the extension service, the Directorates General
of the MOA, DINAS, policymakers, famners groups, local govenments,
the private sector, community organizations, and local universities. A
University Research Grant Scheme and Scientific Exchange Program will
be established.
10.   Project Costs and Financing Plan. Total project cost is estimated at US$101.8
million. Schedule A provides details on project cost and financing. Schedule B sets out
the amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement. Schedule C summarizes key
project processing events, and the status of Bank Group operations in Indonesil is given
in ScheduleD. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 13933-IND dated
April 21, 1995, is being distributed separately.
11.   Project Implementation and Sustainability.  Most project actions will be
implemented at the regional level in accordance with specific local requirements,
capabilities, and stage of development, and carefully integrated with other provincial level
activities to strengthen regional and local development initiatives. The Project would be
implemented by AARD and its work units in selected regions in conjunction with local
agricultural staff and universities, guided by Advisory Committees made up of
representatives from local government, university, client groups, rual community, and the
pnvate sector.   Farmers will strongly influence the R&D agenda through their
participation in on-farm research, demonstrations, field days, and consultative meetings.
Emphasis will be given to local participation to ensure commitment of local agencies and
their active participation in decision-maling. Project management units at both national
and regional levels will utilize existing structures and procedures of the agencies in which
they reside to cany out project operations, including fund releases, accounting, auditing,
and technical audit.
12.   The Project was prepared entirely by AARD  itself in conjunction with
representatives of regional and provincial agencies using a participatory, bottom-up



-5-
approach, ensuring a high degree of project ownership at all levels. It is consistent with
GOI's policies and activities contained in the Repelita VI, the Agricultural Research Policy
Statement (1994-1999), and the Strategic Plan for Agricultural Research and
Development for the period 1995-2005. Based cn past performance and agrted actions
under the project, GOI appears to be committed to increasing agricultural R&D funding,
ensuring that actions initiated under the Project will be sustained.
13.   Agreed Actions. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that (a) key
AIAT staff will be appointed and Regional Advisory Committees and Regional Technical
Working Groups for the four AIATs in Phase E will be established by October 1, 1995;
(b) detailed designs and tender documents for Phase II civil works will be completed by
March 31, 1996; (c) GOI will continue to increase AARD's R&D operational
expenditures by a minimum of 3 percent per annum, in real tenns, and will maintain levels
of operational expenditures for the activities financed by the project at or above those
projected in the staff appraisal report, as loan funds for this purpose progressively
decrease; (d) annual work plans and budget, approved by the Regional Advisory
Commnittees, will be furnished to the Bank by December 31 each year; (e) monitoring and
evaluation reports, based on agreed performance indicators, will be sent to the Bank semni-
annually, including technical audit reports prepared by the Inspectorate General of
Agriculture, annually; and (f) a joint mid-term evaluation will be undertaken by September
30, 1998.
14.   Environmental Aspects. The Project is rated as Category C: 'No appreciable
environmental impact." The completed project should have a positive effect on the
environment by encouraging the sustainable use of localized resource mdxes and by
facilitating the generation and wider adoption of more sustainable and environment-
friendly technology, including available conservation faming techniques, in different
agroecological regions.
15.   Social and Gender 1ssues. The Project will foster greater awareness of the social
and cultural dimensions of agricultural development, including agency-related issues and
the use of tools, such as gender and social analysis and participatory planning, in
determnining the research and technology agenda and in implementing project activities.
This will ensure that women, youth, and distinct cultural groups will benefit direcfly from
project interventions because activities are based on their specific needs and their role in
the household and in the production systems. Special gender and ethnicity studies will be
carried out in collaboration with universities to determine the needs of these special
groups and to monitor the effects of technological innovations introduced by the R&D
system on their circumstances. The active participation of women, youth, and distinct
cultural groups will be encouraged in relevant project activities and in regional fora and
committees.
16.   Project Benefits. The benefits of the Project would be wide-spread through the
agriculture sector as reflected in more effective and efficient management and use of R&D
resources, especially at the regional and provincial levels. A focus on agribusiness and
agro-industry will broaden the beneficiaries of R&D outputs to include those involved at
the postharvest, processing, and marketing end of the agricultural production spectunL



- 6 -
With the regional focus on R&D, there will be greater capacity to generate and test
location-specific technologies, package appropriate technologies, and transfer them to
more farmers and create diverse production systems. Stronger research-extension-farmer
linkages will ensure that technology is demand-driven and clients' needs and
circumstances are the basis for planning and design of R&D projects. Improved linkages
to policy-makers will facilitate faster and wider application of new technology and ensure
that the R&D system effectively supports national and sectoral objectives, through more
responsive policies.
17.   Risks. In addition to the normal risks associated with any research undertakdng,
where results can not be guaranteed, the main risks of the proposed project are associated
with unsatisfactory implementai on of project actions in regionalizing the R&D system due
to: (a) possible resistance to policy and institutional changes and continued institutional
weakness in canfying out the required reforms at the lower levels; (b) scientists and
technical support staff may not agree to move to regions and provinces and less developed
areas, which was apparent in the implementation of the ongoing ARM Project;
(c) resistance by provincial agencies to provide their fiill support and participation to a
regional R&D system, especially where AARD capacity is low, and (d) continued
inadequate funding for operations and maintenance expenditures. The latter could
become a major risk if funds from domestic and other sources could not be adequately
increased during the project period and beyond by increasing the current R&D fimding
level. This would threaten the sustainability of the R&D system and positive impact of
R&D outputs. Project design includes assurances from GOI to increase total agricultural
research funding and measures and incentives, such as, inter alia, increased budgets and
twining opportunities for agencies and staff involved, to minimize these risks.
18.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and reconunend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed loan.
