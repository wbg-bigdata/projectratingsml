SECOND RUBBER REHABILITATION PROJECT
Development Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:                 The Socialist RepubLic of the Union of Burma
Amount:                   Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) 8.4 million
(US$9 million equivalent)
Terms:                    Standard
Project Objectives
and Description:        The proposed project would help increase rubber
production through rehabilitation and expansion
on eight Government rubber estates, seven of
which were included in the First Rubber Project
(879-BA), and establish a new estate (3,000 ac)
at Sonsin. The Project would include 6,100 ac of
replantings to replace overaged trees and new
plantings over 4,900 ac. Also, 4,500 ac of rubber
planted under the First Rubber Project would be
brought to maturity. Provision has been made for
procurement of materials and equipment, processing
facilities, vehicles and housing. Technical assis-
tance and training under the Project would help
strengthen the Rubber Section (Plantation Crop
Division of the Agriculture Corporation in the
Ministry of Agriculture and Forest) in all aspects
of modern rubber production and expand the program
of research.
Risks:                    The technology chosen demands a high degree of
competence, particularly in the production of clonal
pLanting materials. Nevertheless, the experience
gained by the staff of the Rubber Section in the
latter stages of implementing the First Project
and the training that has been arranged under the
proposed project should ensure successful implementa-
tion.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF THE UNION OF BURMA
FOR A SECOND RUBBER REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation for a proposed
deveLopment credit to the SociaList Republic of the Union of Burma for
Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) 8.4 milLion (US$9.0 million equivalent) on
standard IDA terms to help finance a Second Rubber Rehabilitation project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.      The latest economic report entitled, "Burma:  Priorities for
Continued Growth" (Report No. 3852-BA, dated May 7, 1982) was distributed to
the Executive Directors on May 10, 1982. Country data are shown in Annex I.
3.      The present leadership of Burma assumed the responsibilities of
government in 1962 and vested authority in a revolutionary counciL. There-
after, a Constitution was adopted in a nationwide referendum in December
1973, creating the Pyithu Hluttaw (People's Assembly) with supreme executive,
legislative, and judicial authority. The Burma Socialist Program Party
(BSPP) was confirmed as the only authorized political party. The Govern-
ment's guiding philosophy stated in the 1962 document entitled The Burmese
Way to Socialism reflects a combination of traditional Burmese values
and socialist doctrine. Its economic objectives are set out in the Twenty-
Year Plan, which was adopted by the BSPP in 1972 and is being implemented
through a succession of Four-Year Plans. U Ne Win, who had been President
since 1962, announced his resignation just prior to the national election in
November 1981 and was succeeded by U San Yu, former Secretary General of the
BSPP. Insurgency remains a problem, particularly in the hills and border
areas, although there is definitely greater territorial control by the
Government now than at any time since Independence in 1948.
4.      During the 1960s and the early 1970s, the Government made substantial
progress in the attainment of its social and political goals, particularly in
terms of extending public ownership and Burmese control of economic institu-
tions. On the other hand, economic performance suffered over this period,
the major features being slow growth, a fall in domestic savings and a
shrinking of the external sector. In recognition of this poor economic
performance, the Government came up with a new development strategy in 1972
1/ Parts I and II of this report are substantially the same as in the Presi-
dent's Report (Report No. P-3558-BA) dated May 5, 1983 for the Third Port
Project in Burma. The report was distributed to the Executive Directors
under cover of the Secretary's memorandum IDA/R8359.



-2-
with the publication of the Twenty-Year Plan. The main objectives of the
Plan are to foster economic growth within the context of a socialist system,
to enhance economic strength and self-sufficiency by converting from an
agricultural to an agriculture-based industrial society, to eLiminate
unemployment and to reduce income disparities. The main elements of this
strategy are: (a) to give higher priority initially to the directly produc-
tive sectors, especially to agriculture, forestry, and mining; (b) to make
greater use of aid, trade, and to a lesser extent technical assistance;
(c) to follow a price stabilization program which emphasizes cost reduction,
through increased efficiency in industry and technical change in agriculture;
and (d) introduce work incentives and commercial principles, especially in
the State Economic Enterprises (SEEs).
5.      A wide range of policy reforms followed the publication of the
Twenty-Year Plan. While pricing policy still reflected the desire to provide
basic consumer goods cheaply and to prevent inflation, procurement prices of
a variety of agricultural products were raised substantially to improve the
economic position of the farmer. In industry, the Government increased the
ex-factory prices for many of the SEEs. Meanwhile, the official exchange
rate was devalued and the interest rate on savings deposits raised. In
addition to these pricing reforms the Government introduced a major tax
reform designed to restore the country's public finance to a sound basis.
6.      In part, as a result of these measures, and in part as a result of
favorable weather and increased capital inflows, GDP during the Second
Four-Year Plan (1974/75-1977/78) increased by an annual average of 4.7%,
compared to 2.7% in the previous decade. Gross fixed capital formation
increased by about 8% per annum in real terms, and domestic savings as a
percent of GDP also increased. The improved budgetary provision of the
Government lessened its dependence on the banking system, which, in turn,
contributed to a reduction in the rate of inflation.
7.      The growth momentum was sustained through the Third Four Year Plan
period (1978/79-1981/82). During this time, Burma achieved an average annual
GDP growth of 6.5% in real terms, accompanied by rising exports and stable
prices. This favorable performance has been largely due to (a) steadily
rising agricultural production, resulting mainly from the Government's intro-
duction of high-yielding varieties; (b) higher capacity utilization primarily
in industry; and (c) rapid increases in investment, particularly in the
public sector.
8.      The Government's introduction of an agricultural intensification
program, the Whole Township Program, has contributed to a revitalization of
agriculture in Burma in recent years. This Program, extended now to about 80
townships, has a number of unique features, including the participation of
the People's Councils in coordinating production and procurement; selectivity
and concentration through a campaign-type approach; mobilization of the
community to provide additional labor; and the priority provision of consumer
goods to project areas to complement rising incomes. Program coverage for



-3-
paddy, expanded from 2% of paddy-sown area in 1977/78 to 51% in 1981/82;
during this period, paddy production increased by about 50%. The Whole
Township Program has also been extended to other crops, including groundnuts,
maize, wheat, sesame, cotton, beans and pulses with good results. The focus
of the Government's agriculturaL program over the next few years will be on
the consolidation of past gains in paddy, with particular emphasis on quality
improvements in export rice, and further extension of the Whole Township
Program to non-paddy crops. There are indications that the dramatic
increases in agricultural production in recent years have highlighted the
bottlenecks in complementary transportation, handling, storage and milling
facilities.  In the coming years, the Government will have to deal with these
bottlenecks through investments in additional capacity.
9.     Benefiting from increased domestic supplies of agricultural raw
materials as well as from a steady growth of intermediate good imports,
capacity utilization in the light and agro-based industries in the public
sector has improved. The increased level of economic activity during this
period is also reflected in the higher gross domestic capital formation. The
share of investment in GDP in constant prices increased from 15% in 1978/79
to 17% in 1981/82. On the other hand, the rapid expansion of public invest-
ment, which accounts for 70% of the total, has been largely responsible for
the widening in the overall budgetary deficit from 10% of GDP in 1978/79 to
an estimated 17% in 1981/82. Public savings have shown only a modest growth,
and the increasing deficit has been financed by large increases in external
assistance and domestic credit.
10.     Over the same period, merchandise exports increased in nominal terms
by 19% per annum, though the export growth in 1981/82, the last year of the
Third Four Year Plan period, was adversely affected by a sharp decline in the
international price of rice. Merchandise imports increased in current prices
by 20% annually. The current account deficit stabilized at about 6% of GDP,
and net disbursements of loans at around iZ$320O400 million a year. The
relatively small current account deficit refLeczs the Government's conserva-
tive approach to balance-of-payments management, not the real import needs of
the country. The Government controls all imports through a foreign exchange
budget, drawn up in accordance with anticipated financing.  Although foreign
exchange availabilities have improved, shortages of imported intermediate and
consumer goods still remain.
11.     The Government's planned annual GDP growth for the Fourth Four Year
Plan is 6.2%. In order to attain this ambitious target, the Government needs
to achieve: (a) continued success in the development of the agriculturaL
sector; (b) further improvements in capacity utilization especially in
industry; (c) a judicious choice of investment projects; and (d) sufficient
resources - both foreign and domestic - to expand the investment program at
the required rate. Over the medium term, rice exports will undoubtedly
continue to be the mainstay for Burma's foreign exchange earnings. However,
the Government's longer term strategy is to broaden the country's export base
through agricultural diversification and promotion of agro-based industries,



-4-
to reduce Burma's reliance on rice and teak and to insulate the economy
progressively from the international price fluctuations of less processed
primary commodity exports.
12.     Moreover, in order to maintain the growth momentum, the Government
will need to expand absorptive capacity for external assistance by emphasiz-
ing institution building and management development to a much greater extent
than in the past. The Burmese planning and administrative system, as it now
exists, is complex and rigid in its manner of operation and appears to focus
excessively on the formulation of targets. Streamlining of the entire plan-
ning and administrative apparatus, decentralization of decision-making, and
strengthening of the capability of Government entities to prepare and imple-
ment projects are urgently needed.
13.     Burma's debt service ratio increased from 13% in the 1977/78 to about
28% in 1981/82, due primarily to a substantial increase in the loans from
private financial institutions and suppliers' credits. By March 1982,
Burma's external public debt, disbursed and outstanding, was approximately
US$1.6 bilLion. Burma's exports have been showing steady growth in recent
years, but the prospects over the medium term is less favorable. According
to the World Bank's price projections, Burma's terms of trade which had
deteriorated during the Last two years would, at best, recover slowly over
the next four years. Moreover, because of the rising debt service burden
and because of Burma's low income level, external assistance should continue
to be on concessionary terms and should, in addition, finance part of local
cost requirements which cannot, at present, be covered adequately by domestic
savings. Local cost financing is particularly needed for the agricultural
sector where most investments have a low foreign exchange component.
14.     Burma is potentially one of the richest countries in South Asia.
Apart from an impressive naturaL resource base, it is endowed with a rela-
tively healthy and literate population. The crucial question is the quality
with which these resources will be managed and developed. The Bank continues
to discuss with the Government further improvements in economic management
which would help Burma realize its promising potential for economic develop-
ment as well as external assistance requirements. Discussions on these
topics are carried on jointLy with other donors and the IMF during the Burma
Aid Group meetings which the Bank has organized at the Government's request.
The first meeting of the Group was heLd on November 30, 1976, in Tokyo; and
there have been four subsequent meetings, with indications of increasing
donor support each year.



-5-
PART I! - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
15.     Burma became a member of the Bank in 1952, IFC in 1956, and IDA in
1962. Between 1956 and 1961, the Bank made three loans totalling US$33.1
million, all for transportation projects. One Loan for the Port of Rangoon
helped finance the reconstruction of cargo berths and storage facilities, and
the purchase of cargo handling and port equipment. Two loans helped finance
the post-war reconstruction and dieselization of the railways. All three
projects were satisfactorily completed and the loans fully disbursed by FY68.
16.     No lending was requested between 1962 and 1972.  IDA lending resumed
in 1973 and since then 20 credits totaling about US$536 million equivalent
(net of cancelLations) have been made. About 60% of this assistance was for
the agricultural sector, consisting of twelve projects: irrigation pumps,
rubber, livestock, seed development, two paddyLand development projects,
grain storage, two forestry projects, a wood industries project, the Kinda
Dam multipurpose project, and a tank irrigation project. About 12% of IDA's
assistance supported the rehabilitation of the transport sector through four
projects, namely inland water transport, railways, a second ports project and
a construction industry project. The remaining 28% of IDA assistance has
been for two projects in the telecommunications sector (10%), one project in
the mining sector (3%) and a power project (15%). Six credits have been
fully disbursed so far. On the resumption of operations in 1973 there were
some difficulties with disbursement performance. However, performance has
improved considerably particularly as agencies, such as the Irrigation
Department, have become more familiar with the Bank's procedures. In
general, IDA-financed projects have been carried out satisfactorily.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA Credits as of
March 31, 1983, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects. IFC has made
no investments in Burma.
17.     In the past, lending was partly constrained by incomplete knowledge
of some sectors and the lack of adequately prepared projects. Through the
ongoing projects and sector work, the Bank's knowledge of many sectors has
improved. A US$4.1 million UNDP technicaL assistance project (Burma Umbrella
Project), for which the Bank is the executing agency, has developed a project
pipeline suitable for external financing in priority sectors such as agricul-
ture, transport, power, and industry. Several projects, namely, Seed
Development, Rubber Rehabilitation, Power, Construction Industry and
Groundwater Irrigation were prepared under the Umbrella Project, which is now
in its third phase.  Furthermore, the Association plans to continue its
technical assistance on a project-by-project basis to help improve Burmese
project preparation and implementation capabilities, as well as administra-
tive and managerial skills through in-service and overseas training.



-6-
18.     The Bank Group strategy is aimed at easing the most immediate con-
straints to growth and, particularLy, at increasing and diversifying produc-
tion for export in order to alleviate the shortage of foreign exchange.
Within this overall strategy, primary emphasis is being placed on the
development of agriculture, forestry, and mining. Within this framework and
where possible, priority is being given to quick-yielding projects. At the
same time, financing of infrastructure improvements will continue in the
development of power and such areas as transportation, telecommunications,
and construction, mainly to rehabiLitate and maximize utilization of existing
facilities.
19.     In line with the need to increase Burma's foreign exchange earnings,
many of the projects under active preparation are designed to have an impact
on increasing agricultural surpluses for export. Projects under preparation
include paddy deveLopment, tubewells, rubber rehabilitation, textiles finish-
ing plant and an integrated export commodity transport project.
20.     The Bank Group currently accounts for about 15% of Burma's total
external debt outstanding and about 1% of its debt service. In five years,
the Bank Group's share in the total external debt is projected to rise to
about 20% and its share in the debt service to about 2-3%.
PART - III THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Agriculture
21.     Agriculture, including livestock, forestry and fisheries, continues
to be the principal sector of the Burmese economy, accounting directly for
about 45% of GDP, 65% of the labor force, and 80% of total exports in
1981/82. Rice, the major agricultural and export commodity, is also a sig-
nificant source of government revenue through impLicit taxation from
GOB-controlled pricing and exportation. Rice is planted on over 50% (13
million ac) of the total sown area (25 million ac) and accounts for more than
one-third of total agricultural output. Other main crops incLude sesame (15%
of the gross sown area), pulses (8%), groundnuts (5%), industrial crops (5%),
and plantation crops (5%). As a major export item, rice accounted for 77% of
agricultural export revenue in 1981/82, followed by blackgram (6%), jute
(6%), rubber (5%) and oilcakes (3%).
22.     During the 1960s and early 1970s, value added in agriculture rose
at only about 1.6% p.a., well below the prevailing 2.2% population growth
rate, and as a result the rice export surplus declined to less than 200,000
tons compared to more than 3 million tons pre-war. This unsatisfactory
performance can be attributed to a number of inter-related factors, including
unsettling changes in land policy, inadequate farmer incentives and the
initial failures of imported high yielding paddy varieties which proved
ill-adapted to local conditions.



-7-
23.     Faced with this situation, the government responded in two principal
ways. First, beginning in 1973/74, a series of policy reforms were under-
taken designed to improve incentives and provide for greater flexibility in
the farming sector: for instance, procurement prices were substantially
increased; mandatory procurement quotas were reduced; certain commodities
were decontrolled; there was a major tax and exchange reform; and Government
greatly increased its willingness to accept foreign assistance. Secondly,
emphasis was placed on evolving HYVs adapted to local conditions and promot-
ing their use, together with subsidized agricultural inputs, through a major
new government program (the Whole Township Extension Program). By and large
these policies have proved successful. Despite only Limited further price
increases, incentives have been sufficient to encourage the adoption of HYVs
through the Whole Township Program. Consequently, between 1974/75 - 1981/82,
paddy production increased from 8.4 million tons to 13.9 million tons, and
the overall growth in agricultural value-added averaged no less than 7.2% per
annum.
24.     Further production increases are no doubt possible through inten-
sification of areas already planted to HYVs and area expansion through, for
instance, low cost rehabilitation and land reclamation programs. There is
also considerable potential for crop diversification, and the Whole Township
Program has been extended to other crops, in particular maize and wheat and
oilseeds. Industrial crops, such as cotton, are also being given greater
attention and there is considerable potential for increased production cf
horticultural crops, tree crops, Livestock and fisheries. A major GOB policy
objective is to reduce dependence on rice exports in the face of uncertain
market prospects, in part through crop diversification.
25.     In support of this development strategy, IDA-assisted projects in
irrigation, paddy development and rubber are making a notable contribution
in expanding sown areas and further facilitating widespread adoption of high
yielding varieties. IDA would continue to assist the governments in con-
solidating past gains in paddy production while increasing efforts to diver-
sify into non-paddy cash crops. In the case of rubber, this diversification
process will require that the Government maximizes production of currently
planted rubber trees, replaces overaged trees and expands rubber growing area
while increasing staff capacity to improve production of high quality plant-
ing materials and expanding research. The proposed project is designed to
support this strategy.
The Rubber Subsector
26.     Rubber was introduced in the Tenasserim salient (latitude 10 degrees
to 17 degrees N) in southern Burma about 100 years ago. By 1930, the area
under rubber had reached about 120,000 ac but the economic depression fol-
lowed by World War II completely disrupted the industry. Considerable new
plantings and rehabilitation work, mainly by the Government, helped expand
rubber cultivation to a peak of 220,000 ac by 1969. Nevertheless, rubber
production has declined in recent years and the total area under rubber is



-8-
now estimated at about 200,000 ac. Today, the main rubber growing area
comprises Mon State and Tenasserim Division, which accounts for about 86% of
the country's rubber. Rubber is also scattered in the Less ecologically
suitable areas north and northwest of the Tenasserim salient. Only about 58%
of the total pLanted area is currently being exploited; the balance being
either immature or abandoned, the latter possibly because of security
problems.
27.     Rubber yields in Burma currently average about 300 lbs per tapped
acre which is about 60% of the worLd average. Total annual rubber production
over the past decade has been around 15,000 tons, equivalent to about 0.4% of
the world total. Under the project, the average yield of rubber would
increase to about 1,000 lbs per tapped acre from the project rubber area
totalling 11,000 acres; the peak annual production being about 6,500 tons,
all of which would be exported. This additional output, however, is not
expected to materially affect Burma's share of world production nor the
export market. Current production from the 14 (out of a total of 22) public
estates not included in the project and the private sector would continue to
meet local demand and allow for some export. The price of naturaL rubber
rose from the depressed 1975 level of US$0.99/kg. (in 1981 constant prices)
for RSS Grade 1/spot New York to a high of US$1.55/kg. in 1980 but slipped
again to US$1.25/kg. in 1981. The Bank's December 1982 forecast projected
the price to rise to US$1.61/kg. in 1995 (in 1981 constant prices). The
average price forecast beween 1980 and 1995 is US$1.38s/kg. (in 1981 constant
prices). Official exports of rubber from Burma have averaged about 8,000
tons annually, contributing about US$6.0 million per year or about 3% of
total exports. An estimated 3,000 tons of rubber is exported annualLy out-
side official channels from privately owned smalLholdings (holdings of about
100 ac or less) in the southern half of Tenasserim mainly because of easy
access to Malaysia and Thailand.
28.     Government estates cover about 40,000 acres or roughly 20% of the
total rubber area. The private sector comprising smalLholders (54% of area)
and private estates, (26% of area) account for 159,000 ac, of which about
95,000 ac are currently exploited. Rubber production on private estates, and
to a lesser extent on smalLholdings, has declined largely due to failure to
replace overaged trees for various reasons including a general shortage of
improved planting material and lack of credit for replanting.
29.     The shortage of planting material would be progressively eliminated
with the establishment of budwood gardens and nurseries under the proposed
project. Government is reluctant to provide financial support for replanting
which could not be recovered by a cess on rubber exports as is done in
Thailand and Malaysia. Nevertheless, the Government does provide credit in
the form of advancing funds to farmers at the beginning of the year for
rubber procured near the end of the year. The Government also performs other
services, such as, subsidizing fertilizers and chemicals, providing estate
supplies at cost and maintaining roads, schools, health clinics, water
supply, etc. The proposed project includes a socio-economic study which,



-9-
inter alia, would investigate possible incentive systems which could stimu-
Late development of the private rubber holdings and heLp this segment become
self-sustaining. ResuLts of this study would help both the Government and
IDA focus on short and medium term measures to assist the industry.
Past IDA assistance to Rubber Subsector
30.     A Credit of US$4.5 million for the First Rubber Rehabilitation
Project (Credit 879-BA) was made in March 1979 to rehabilitate and expand
15 of the 22 existing rubber estates in the pubLic sector. The Credit became
effective in May 1979 and the project is expected to be compLeted in December
1984. Prior to the First Project, the Government had greatly increased the
import of improved planting material required to replant overaged and less
productive rubber trees. Nevertheless, further assistance was needed for
supporting investments in rubber estate equipment, civil works, processing
facilities, technical assistance and staff training. Principal features of
the project were rehabilitation of 15 Government-owned estates by replacing
old equipment, replanting 3,375 acres of unproductive but existing rubber
trees, planting of an additional 1,125 acres on those estates and introduc-
tion of modern exploitation practices; rehabilitation of a crumb rubber
factory; and staff development and research.
31.     Overall progress in implementing the Project has been satisfactory;
by late 1982, almost all machinery, equipment and vehicles had been procured;
civil works and training were nearly complete and the planting program was
about 80% of target. Although the Project started slowly due to poor quality
of imported budwood for planting and inexperience of staff in budding techni-
ques, adequate supplies now exist and staff capabilities have been con-
siderably strengthened through extensive field training. The construction of
the crumb factory has been delayed because of malfunctioning of drilling
equipment required for completing hydrological tests at the site. It is now
expected that the factory would be completed by early 1984. Low disbursement
performance is primarily due to delays in completion of the crumb factory.
32.     Given the Government's objective of expanding production on govern-
ment estates, the proposed Second Rubber Project has been designed to meet
the near-term development and institutional needs of Burma's rubber industry.
It would further upgrade infrastructure on selected rubber estates, expand
production through replanting overaged trees and planting of new areas,
expand staff capabilities in rubber production, particularly in using locally
produced budwood, and institutionaLize and expand the research program.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Introduction
33.     The proposed Second Rubber Project would build on the achievements
made under the First Project. The preparation report was prepared by the
Rubber Section (RS) of the Plantation Crop Division tPCD) of the Agricultural              i
Corporation (AC) and its' consultants, Harrisons Fleming Advisory Services
(HFAS). A staff appraisal report entitled "Second Rubber Rehabilitation
Project" (Report No. 4326-BA dated May 17, 1983) is being distributed
separateLy. A timetable of key events relating to the project and special
conditions are given in Annex III. Negotiations were held in Washington,
D.C. from April 18 to April 22, 1983. The delegation from the Socialist
Republic of the Union of Burma was headed by His Excellency U Kyaw Htain,
Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Forests tMAF) and included U Khin Maung
Latt, Director General, Planning and Statistics Department and U Tin Maung,
General Manager, Agriculture Corporation, MAF.
Project Objectives and Description
34.     The main objective of the Project would be to expand Burma's rubber
production through replacement of overaged rubber and development of new
planting using locally produced budwood. The Project would provide technical
assistance for project implementation and a program of research and training
of staff. The main features of the project would be:
(a) Estate Rehabilitation and Expansion. Establishment of high
yielding rubber on 11,000 ac through replacement of 6,100 ac
overaged trees; new planting of 1,900 ac on eight existing
government estates; and development of 3,000 ac of rubber on a
new estate at Sonsin in the Tenasserim Division. In addition,
the project would provide machinery, equipment, vehicles,
factories, offices and staff quarters;
(b) Maintenance of Rubber Trees Planted under the First Project.
Provision of estate supplies (fertilizer, weedicides, pesticides)
and labor to bring into production 4,500 ac of rubber
planted under the First Project.
(c) TechnicaL Assistance and Staff Training. Provision of 40 man-
months of technical assistance; 96 man-months of fellowships,
16 man-months of short term training and 35 man-months of
group training, conferences and seminars all to be held
overseas; and
(d) Research. Establishment of foliar analysis laboratory and
implementation of a program of adaptive research, including
field trials and laboratory investigations.



-11-
Salient Features of the Project
35.     The six year Project would include one new and eight existing govern-
ment estates, of which seven were included in the First Project. All these
estates are located in the Tenasserim salient. The eighth existing govern-
ment estate, Sittang Valley, is situated about 112 miles northeast of Rangoon
in Mon state, whilst the new Sonsin estate would be located south of Tavoy.
36.     Project planting of 6,100 ac of overaged trees and establishment of
IL           4,900 ac of new rubber would be phased over five years commencing in the
second year. Clear felling would be followed in the second year by planting
of seedlings. About half of the plantings under the First Project was from
seed imported from Malaysia. Local staff, however, have now gained con-
siderable experience in preparing and planting improved material derived from
locally grown budwood and it is proposed that all future plantings would be
derived from locally produced budgrafted material. Provision would also be
made for importation of some new clones for testing. Exploitation practices
introduced under the First Project would be continued, with upward tapping in
the upper panels of oLder trees, latex stimulation using ethrel or its equiv-
alent, and improved tree husbandry, including manuring of all potentially
productive mature trees. The civil works program would continue to
rehabilitate and expand facilities on the eight existing estates and under-
take new works at the Sonsin estate. Under the Project, two factories, six
smokehouses, seven offices and 103 staff houses would be built. Staff hous-
ing is essentiaL to ensure the availability of a nucleus of trained workers
and tappers at each of these isolated estates. Farm equipment, such as,
sprinkler irrigation systems, tractors, plows, harrows, sprayers and chain-
saws would be provided for estate maintenance. Provision would also be made
for sheeting batteries and ancilLary equipment comprising coagulation tarks
and baling presses required for factory rehabilitation and expansion. Tran-
sportation would be improved by providing road graders, tractors, trailers,
and trucks.
37.     About 4,500 ac of rubber planted under the First Project would be
brought to maturity since rubber comes into production about seven to eight
*            years after planting.  The First Project provided for the cost of estab-
lishing rubber and its maintenance over the project period but none of these
plantings attained maturity before the project ended. The proposed Project
would provide fertilizers, weedicides, pesticides and labor for the continued
maintenance of these pLantings until such time as they mature.
Technical Assistance and Staff Training
38.     Consultants' Services.  The total provision for technical assistance
would be 40 man-months. The proposed UNDP project would provide 34
man-months. A Chief Technical Adviser (CTA) would be engaged [Sections 3.02
and 3.06(a) of the draft Development Credit Agreement (DCA)J, from January
1985, for a period of 24 months to provide assistance with field operations,



-12-
staff training and technicaL guidance and fill the void following the conclu-
sion of the services provided under the ongoing HFAS contract. Ten
man-months of short-term consultancy services would be available, inter alia,
to (a) advise on pathology problems, nursery diseases, research methodology
and processing and marketing of rubber; and (b) establish a foliar analysis
laboratory. Separate provision has been made for engaging local consultants
to undertake a socio-economic survey of the rubber industry.  Six man-months
of unspecified consulting services would be available to meet unforeseen
needs which might arise during the sixth year of project implementation.
39.     Staff Training.  The training program would provide 96 man-months of                X
overseas fellowships for four national staff, leading to the award of
post-graduate degrees in plant pathology, tree crop agronomy, soil
science/plant nutrition and plant breeding. Sixteen man-months of short
courses overseas would be provided for eight staff members to cover pLant
protection, project implementation, soil/foliar analysis and management
training for trainers. Thirty-two man-months would be provided for group
training overseas for 14 staff members to cover estate management, clone
identification, rubber cultivation and research. Three man-months would be
provided for six staff members to attend conferences and seminars overseas.
The Rubber Section (RS) and IDA would review, not later than January 1, 1984
and thereafter not later than April 1 of each year, the proposed overseas
training program for RS's staff (Section 3.06(b) of the draft DCA).
40.     Financing.  Technical assistance and staff training would be financed
mainly under a UNDP program scheduled to start from January 1984. The agree-
ment between Government, FAO (the executing agency) and UNDP is expected to
be signed in July 1983. However, in case of delay beyond October 31, 1983 or
by such later date as the Association may agree, the government would ensure,
to the satisfaction of the Association, that adequate funds for the proposed
technical assistance and training would be available (Section 5.01 of the
draft DCA). The proposed Credit provides SDRs 70,000 for technical assis-
tance needs expected to arise during the sixth year of project implementation
when all UNDP grant funds would have been fully committed.
41.     Research.  A wealth of research information is available from nearby
rubber-producing countries which could be profitably adapted to Burmese
conditions. Under the Project, a foliar analysis laboratory would be estab-
lished to help formulate a rational policy for fertilizer application. This
laboratory would also serve the needs of oil palm and other plantation crops.
Routine leaf sampling and analyses would alLow monitoring of the nutrient
status of trees and help achieve economies in fertilizer applications. The
modest program of research into rubber agronomy (begun under the First
Project) would continue and would include crown-budding and selection of
"crown" clones, plant nutrition studies, tapping and latex stimuLation. The
research program would be developed in consultation with the Chief Technical
Adviser. RS would prepare and submit annually to IDA its five year research
program by December 31 of each year beginning December 31, 1984, the first
such plan to cover the period April 1, 1984 to March 31, 1989.  In addition,



-13-
RS would prepare annually and submit to IDA an annual research report cover-
ing the period April 1 to March 31 and detailing research findings. These
reports would be submitted not later than June 30 of each year commencing
June 30, 1985 (Section 4.03 of the draft DCA).
Organization and Management
42.     The Agriculture Corporation (AC), under the Ministry of Agriculture
and Forests (MAF), has overall responsibility for operating 22 rubber estates
with about 40,000 ac of rubber. The Government is the sole legal buyer from
all sources and markets rubber for export or for domestic consumption.
Within AC, a Plantation Crop Division (PCD) was created in 1981, and has two
principal sub-divisions, namely, RS and the Oil Palm Section. PCD, acting
through these Sections, is responsible for (a) provision of supplies and
extension services to rubber smalLholders and private estates; (b) extension,
research and production of rubber, oil palm, coconut and cocoa on government
estates; and (c) procurement, processing and marketing of plantation crops.
43.     RS would be responsible for implementing the project.  A Project
Manager would coordinate all headquarters, regional and estate activities.
Project implementation in the field would be the responsibility of regional
managers and respective estate managers. Project performance would be
monitored by an internal monitoring unit located in RS. Each estate, with
the help of headquarters staff, would annually prepare a five-year develop-
ment plan for the current and following four years. These estate plans
would include details of physical developments and annual income and expendi-
ture budgets and would be incorporated to produce a five-year development
plan for RS. RS would submit to IDA, not later than April 1 of each year,
commencing in 1984, its five year development plan outlining planned physical
activities and an income and expenditure budget (Section 3.07 of the draft
DCA).
Project Costs and Financing
44.     The total cost of the Project is estimated at about US$13.7 million,
including duties and taxes of US$1.5 million, with a foreign exchange com-
ponent of about US$5.9 million.  The proposed IDA Credit of US$9.0 million
equivalent would cover about 74% of project costs, net of taxes and duties,
including 85% (US$5.0 milLion) of foreign costs and 51% (US$4.0 million) of
local costs. The balance of foreign costs (US$0.9 million) would be met by
UNDP. The Government would finance the balance of local costs of
US$3.8 million equivalent. Costs were based on prices prevailing at the end
of 1982 and were updated to July 1983 price levels. Physical contingencies
amount to 4% of base costs and are based on 10% for civil works and 5% for
planting and maintenance costs. Price contingencies amount to about 17% of
base cost plus physical contingencies and were estimated at the rate of 4%
per annum for local costs throughout the implementation period reflecting the
mix of local goods and services to be purchased. Price contingencies for
foreign currency costs were estimated on the basis of annual inflation rates



-14-
of 8% in 1983, 7.5% in 1984, 7% in 1985 and 6% in each year between 1986 and
1989.
45.     Procurement.  Machinery, equipment and vehicles for estate
rehabilitation and research tUS$1.8 million) and estate supplies (US$4.5
million) would be procured following international competitive bidding (ICB)
in accordance with Bank Group Procurement Guidelines. A preference limited
to 15% of the c.i.f. price or the prevailing custom duty, whichever is lower,
would be extended to local manufacturers in the evaluation of bids. Small
contracts costing Less than US$50,000 equivalent for each contract would be
procured through normal government procedures, which incLude obtaining a
minimum of three bids, and which are satisfactory to IDA. Civil works under
the Project (US$1.9 million) would comprise a large number of small, rela-
tively simple works, widely scattered throughout the project area and would
not be suitable for international competitive bidding. RS would construct
buildings with a unit cost of less than K100,000 using its own staff or
locally-hired tradesmen. The Construction Corporation (CC) would be respon-
sible for civil works costing more than K100,000.
46.     Disbursements.  Disbursements from the proposed Credit would cover:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditure for directly imported equipment, estate
supplies and chemicals; (b) 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory) for
equipment, estate supplies and chemicaLs manufactured locally; (c) 70% of
local expenditures for other equipment, estate supplies and chemicals
procured locally; (d) 100% of expenditures for technical assistance; (e) 70%
of local expenditures for civil works; and (f) 70% of local expenditures on
project planting.
Financial and Economic Analysis
47.     Rubber Section is not autonomous and comprises one of the two sec-
tions which make up the Plantation Crop Division within the Agriculture
Corporation, MAF. Its primary function is to produce rubber on 22 existing
estates and sell it to the Procurement Division of the Plantation Crop Divi-
sion. RS is an efficient unit which has earned profits averaging K3.5 mil-
lion annually during the last six years of its operation and which were
absorbed by the Agriculture Corporation.
48.     The project would be financially attractive both to the Agriculture
Corporation and the Governoient. It would generate net outflows totalling
about US$103 million during the first ten years; from year 11 onwards inflows
would result which would reach a peak of t,$46 million in the twentieth year.
The net present value of the project woull be about US$53.6 million, assuming
an opportunity cost of capital of 10%. The internal rate of return before
financing wocld be about 14% based on rLuber exported at a border price of
K4.51/lb calculatec, at 1933 constant prices. For the economic analysis,
project costs include physia3l c)ntinLenzies and excluGe price contingencies,
duties and taxes.  Project inputs contist mostly of t^adeables and labor.
The local content of imported gocds a. . 'o al inputs re shadow priced

through the application of a standard coversion factor of 0.8. Wages for
labor are estimated at full market costs as labor is in short supply in some
parts of the project area and the wages and other benefits provided to
laborers represent the minimum inducement required to attract and retain the
desired labor force. The economic cost for labor is derived by adjust4ng the
market wage rate by the standard conversion factor of 0.8.
t         49.     The economic rate of return for the project is estimated at about
17%.  Switching values 1/ were calculated to assess the impact of va,riations
in cost and benefit streams on the project. The results indicate that the
economic viability of the project is more sensitive to changes in benefits
than to variations in cost. Assuming an opportunity cost of capital of 10%,
total costs would have to rise by 75% but benefits would have to falL by only
43% before the project became economically unacceptable. Similarly, the
project is more sensitive to increases in capital costs than to increases in
recurrent costs. When recurrent costs are broken down between maintenance
costs and direct production costs (tapping and processing), the project is
found to be more sensitive to increases in the cost of tapping and processing
than to maintenance costs. However, the results show that the project would
be economically robust.
Justification and Benefits
50.     The Project would continue the modernization of Government-owned
rubber estates. The major tangibLe benefit would be the production of rubber
from 6,100 ac of replanting and 4,900 ac of new planting totalling 176,000
tons of dry rubber valued at about US$230 million over the Life of the
project (estimated about 43 years). Net foreign exchange earnings would be
about US$200 milLion.
51.     The Project would provide empLoyment totalling about 9,000 man-years
for planting and maintenance of rubber trees during the six-year impLementa-
tion period. Additional employment would aLso be generated for artisans for
construction of two factories, six smokehouses, seven offices and 103 houses.
In the long run, the Project would continue to provide employment for present
regular estate workers (about 950), many of whom would have lost their jobs
due to declining production, if the estates were not rehabilitated. Most of
the employment opportunities would go to Landless families or would suppLe-
ment incomes of families with insufficient land to fully employ family labor
resources. The Project would broaden the base of development by including
two estates, Sittang Valley and Sonsin, and would support the Government's
efforts to stimulate economic activity and generate employment in the Sonsin

discount rate (10% is assumed for Burma).

area. The Project would pave the way for further rehabilitation and expan-
sion of the rubber subsector through staff development, and through the
research program to discover higher yielding planting materials and exploita-
tion practices suitable for Burmese conditions.
Risks
52.     The technology chosen demands a high degree of competence, par-
ticularly in the production of clonal planting materials. Nevertheless, the
experience gained by the staff in the latter stages of implementing the First
Project and the training that has been arranged under the proposed project
should ensure successful implementation.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.     The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Socialist Republic
of the Union of Burma and the Association, and the Recommendation of the
Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agree-
ment of the Association are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
54.     Special conditions of the draft Development Credit Agreement are
given in Section III of Annex III.
55.     I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMtENDATION
56.     I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.

D.  STATUS OF PROJECTS IN EXECUTION (As of March 31, 1983) 1/
Cr. No. 597    Livestock Project; US$7.5 Million Credit of December 30, 1975;
Effective Date: March 26, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1983
Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. The milk plant is
expected to be completed by July 1983 and commissioning by September 1983.
Organization of the miLk colLecting centers is underway. The Veterinary and Animal
Husbandry Department (VAHD) has equalled or exceeded the targets set for number of
vilLages to be covered, number of cows inseminated, semen produced, vaccine
produced, establishment of water points, and staff and farmer training. Nine
thousand acres of pasture remain to be established. The seeds have been procured
and establishment wilL be completed in May/June 1983 when rains begin. The
Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science (IAHVC) has completed about
50% of the move to Yezin. The program of training and fellowships abroad has been
a success.
Cr. No. 642    Paddyland Development Project; US$30.0 Million Credit of
June 21, 1976; Effective Date:  August 20, 19716-; C_Lo_sing
Date: June 30, 1983
The project is about two years behind schedule due to delay in the procure-
ment of construction equipment at the outset of implementation.  After the delivery
of equipment, construction progress had been satisfactory until 1982 when further
delays were encountered due largely to shortages of fuel and cement. A revised
implementation schedule envisages completion of the project, within the original
cost estimates, by end 1984/85. Preliminary survey suggests that substantial
agricultural benefits are being obtained in four completed polders.
Cr. No. 686    Tin and Tungsten Expansion Project; US$16.0 Million Credit of
March 25, 1977; Effective Date: June 13, 1977; CLosing
Date: March 351, 1954-
The dredge has completed delivery tests and is operative. MC2 is procuring
spare parts to avoid future delays of dredge operations. In addition, MC2 has also
increased its efforts in training by sending selected staff to Malaysia.  GOB has
advised the Bank that they would cancel $200,000 allocated for a sector study. The
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution and, in particuLar, to report any problems
which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy them. They
should be read in this sense and with the understanding that they do not pur-
port to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project
execution.

project activity is nearly compLeted. The cLosing date has been put forward to
March 31, 1984 to complete small outstanding disbursements.
Cr. No. 745    Seed DeveLopment Project; US$5.5 Million Credit of November 14,
1977; Effective Date:  February 14, 1978; Closing Date:
June 30, 1984
Procurement, civil works, applied research, seed production, and seed
quality control continue to make satisfactory progress. Staff is now at full
strength. Overseas training is proceeding satisfactorily. The project has been
extended by 18 months, to accommodate previous delays.
Cr. No. 835    Paddyland Development II Project; US$34.5 Million Credit of
July 28, 1978; Effective Date:  October 13, 198; IClosing
Date:  April 30, 1986
The project is proceeding broadly according to schedule. However, shortage
of fuel has caused slight delays in construction. Land recLamation is proceeding
at a satisfactory rate. The allocation of reclaimed land for settlement is await-
ing completion of the necessary surveys, and is a little delayed. The agricultural
extension service and other components of the project are progressing satisfac-
torily.
Cr. No. 879    Rubber Rehabilitation Project; US$4.5 Million Credit of
March 13, 1979; Effective Date:  May 25, 1979; Closing Date:
December 31, 1983
Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily, except for the delay
in the construction of the crumb rubber factory. Management performance is good
and the project has now made up for earlier delays in procurement. Project plant-
ing is expected to be completed by June 1983. Civil works is 74Y of target, and
procurement is nearly completed. Disbursements totalled US$2.2 milLion up to March
31, 1983, compared with SAR estimates of US$3.8 million, largely due to the delay
in the construction of the crumb rubber factory which accounts for about 20X of the
credit. A team of geophysicists has visited the factory site in March 1983 to
advise on the equipment necessary to obtain the 10,000 gallons of water per hour
required by the factory. The present output is 2,000 gallons per hour with a
2-inch outlet. If the test results are satisfactory, the factory would be com-
pleted by mid 1983. The Second Rubber Rehabilitation Project, appraised during
November 1982, has been negotiated.
Cr. No. 949    Forestry II (East Pegu Yoma) Project; US$35.0 Million Credit of
September 21, 1979; Effective Date: December 20, 1979;
Closing Date: September 30, 1985
Implementation of the project is going well. Log extraction targets are
being met with the necessary balance with sawmilling capacity. The sawmill
rehabilitation program is achieving good results with capacity increases to date
totalling about 25,000 HT. The construction of the first of two new hardwood
sawmills is now complete and trial runs began in January 1983. Construction of the
second mill has now started. At Okkyin civil works is about complete and equipment

is being installed. The plantation program is progressing welL and ahead of
scheduLe with a total of 24,780 acres established versus the target for the same
period of 17,750 acres.
Cr. No. 958    Second Telecommunications Project; US$35.0 Million Credit of
q                    December 18, 1979; Effective Date:  March 3, 1980; Closing
Date: December 31, 1984
The project, after a slow start caused by delay in the creation of the
project implementation unit and consequent delays in procurement action, is now
progressing satisfactorily. Overall the project is expected to suffer a delay of a
year and a half. Financial results continue to be satisfactory.
Cr. No. 1031   Kinda (Nyaunggyat) Dam Multipurpose Project; US$90.0 Million
Credit of November 4, 1980; Effective Date: November 19, 1980;
CLosing Date: June 30 1987
Overall progress of the dam and allied structures has been impressive and
on schedule, except the diversion tunnel which was originally delayed by about two
months. ALL steel lining, upstream diversion channel and saddLe dike 3 are com-
pleted and diversion tunnel concreting is 85% complete. Excavation of inlet struc-
ture/spillways/plunge pool, and construction of coffer dam core-filling and rock-
fill, saddle dike 2, and Kinda weir radial gate section are in progress. The
irrigation and agricultural development works are presently about 12 months behind
schedule due to delays in selection of the engineering consultant and procurement
of some equipment. Most of the equipment has now been delivered. The selected
consultant firm for irrigation/deveLopment works has recently started the plan-
ning/design works which are progressing well.
Cr. No. 1092   Grain Storage Project; SDRs 17.9 Million (US$23.0 Million equivalent)
Credit of February 6, 1981; Effective Date:  May 4, 1981; Closing Date:
September 30, 1985
Progress on construction of godowns has been heLd back by shortage of
cement and problems of local procurement of sawn timber.  The Government has,
however, assigned high priority to allocation of construction materials sufficient
to speed up progress, under the coordination and monitoring of the Project Coor-
dination Committee.  Engineering consultants have assisted AFPTC in finalizing
designs of mechanical equipment and prefabricated steel superstructures. A major
start on the rehabilitation of godowns, jetties and railway wagons is underway.
Cr. No. 1114   Wood Industries I Project; SDRs 25.8 Million (US$32.0 Million
equivalent) Credit of March 26, 1981; Effective Date:
June 25, 1981; Closing Date: March 31, 1986
Project procurement continues on schedule. Most equipment contracts for
sawmills, plywood mills, and the furniture factory have been awarded. Civil works
construction for sawmills, furniture factory, and plywood mills is underway.
Project staffing needs to be strengthened to cope with the increased level of
activity expected in the future.

Cr. No. 1245  Power Project; SDRs 70.1 Million (US$80.0 Million equivalent)
Credit of June 28, 1982; Effective Date:  September 28, 1982;
Closing Date: April 30, 1987
The project would help establish an integrated approach to the development
of the Electric Power Corporation's (EPC) transmission facilities and contribute to
improving the efficiency of EPC's power system. The project start up has been
satisfactory to date. Bid evaluation and tendering for equipment is slightly
behind schedule and a delay of two months is expected in awarding contracts.  A
supervision mission is scheduled to return end-April 1983.
Cr. No. 1253 Construction Industry Project; SDRs 18 Million (US$20.0 Million
equivalent) Credit of June 28, 1982; Effect1ve Date:
September 20, 1982; Closing Date: December 31, 1987
The implementation of the project continues to make good progress. Selec-
tion of a consulting firm for the technical assistance to be provided under the
project has been made and the contract signed. With respect to equipment procure-
ment, by early February 1983, Construction Corporation had already opened bids for
abut 70% of the total list of credit equipment and by the end of February 1983 they
were expecting to have opened almost all equipment bids. In ApriL/May 1983 Con-
struction Corporation will be presenting evaluation reports for IDA approval.
Cr. No. 1315  Tank Irrigation Project; SDRs 17.9 Million (US$19.0 Million
equivalent) Credit of February 4, 1983; Effective Date:
April 2Z, 1983; Closing Date:  June 30, 1988
The project consists of two subprojects, each located in distinctly dif-
ferent regions, namely Kinmundaung and Azin. The Kinmundang subproject lies in
Magwe Division in the dry zone of central Burma.  The subproject would provide
year-round irrigation for about 5,000 acres. The Azin subproject is located in the
southern coastal area of Mon state. The subproject would provide irrigation for a
dry-season crop in the area as well as a full drinking water supply for Mudon Town
which has a population of 40,000. Implementation is underway.
