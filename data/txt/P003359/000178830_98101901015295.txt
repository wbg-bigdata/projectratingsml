BURMA
RUBBER REHABILITATION II PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises a Rubber Rehabilitation Project in Burma.
The proposed project is based on the experience gained under IDA-assisted
Rubber Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 879-BA) which is designed to rehabilitate
and modernize the rubber industry in Burma. Project preparation was started
in January 1982 by the Rubber Section of the Plantation Crop Division of the
Agriculture Corporation assisted by Harrisons Fleming Advisory Services
(HFAS), consultants engaged to provide technical assistance! for the first
project. The project preparation report was completed in September 1982. An
appraisal mission consisting of Messrs. M. L. Brown (Mission Leader), A. H.
Green (Tree Crops Advisor), J. W. Blencowe (Consultant - Tree Crops
Specialist) and Ms. 1'. Estoque (Research Assistant) visited Burma during
November 1982. This report is based on the findings of that mission.
II. SECTORAL BACKGROUND
General
2.01      Since 1962, Burma's guiding philosophy known as "Burmese Way to
Socialism" has reflected a combination of traditional Burmese values and
socialist doctrine. Under this philosophy, public ownership of all sectors
of the economy has increased, and greater equality in income has been
achieved. However, during the 1960s and early 1970s, annual GDP growth
averaged 2.7% or little more than the prevailing population growth rate of
2.2% p.a. during that period.
2.02      Faced with this unsatisfactory performance, the Government of Burma
(GOB) initiated a series of reforms in the early 1970s to stimulate economic
growth, cautiously liberalizing its policies and opening up the economy to
increased foreign assistance and capital. Some of its primary actions were
to substantially increase agricultural investment and agricultural procure-
ment prices and launch a major program to increase paddy yields. This
approach proved generally successful, and growth in agriculture since 1975
has been impressive. The GDP growth rate during the first three years of the
Third Four-Year Plan (1978/79-1981/82) averaged about 6.5% lp.a. without
significant inflation. However, Burma still remains one of the poorest
nations in the world as measured by per capita GDP (about US$180 in 1981
compared to more than US$670 in neighboring Thailand). Susitaining the cur-
rent economic momentum should not be difficult given Burma's vast development



-2-
potential within its 260,000 sq mi area, a highly literate and mainly rural
(75%) population of 34 M (end 1980), and a relatively low population density
of 130 per sq mi.
Agricultural Sector
2.03      Agriculture 1/ continues to be the principal sector of the Burmese
economy, accounting directly for about 45% of GDP, 65% of the labor force,
and 80% of total exports in 1981/82. Rice, the major agricultural and export
commodity, is also a significant source of government revenue through
implicit taxation from GOB-controlled pricing and exportation. Rice is
planted on over 50% (13 M ac) of the total sown area (25 M ac) and accounts
for more than one-third of total agricultural output. Other main crops
include sesame (15% of the gross sown area), pulses (8%), groundnuts (5%),
industrial crops (5%), and plantation crops (5%). As a major export item,
rice accounted for 77% of agricultural export revenue in 19831/82, followed by
blackgram (6%), jute (6%), rubber (5%) and oilcakes (3%).
2.04      Froma 1965 to 1975, agriculture's performance was poor as reflected
in its average annual growth of only 1.6%, lower than the prevailing popula-
tion growth rate of 2.2% p.a. during that period. However, in the mid-1970s,
GOB initiated a series of reforms, and the agricultural sector started to
grow rapidly. During the Third-Four Year Plan period (1978/79-1981/82), the
agricultural gyrowth rate averaged 8.7% p.a. National paddy production
increased froni 9.3 M tons in 1977/78 to 13.9 M tons in 1981/82, or a 50%
increase in four years. Although favorable weather conditions played a part,
the recent improvement in agricultural production is mainly attributable to
expanded irrigation and mass introduction of high yielding rice varieties
through the Wlole Township Extension Program. Continued rapid growth in
agriculture would contribute significantly to easing GOB's iLnternal revenue
constraints and foreign exchange shortages.
The Rubber Subsector
2.05      Rubber was introduced in the far south of Burna about 100 years
ago. The trees grew successfully in the Tenasserim salient and the area
under rubber reached about 30,000 ac by the turn of the century and 120,000
ac by 1930. The acreage declined during the economic depression of the 1930s
and the indust:ry was completely disrupted by World War II. Since then, the
acreage has increased, partly as a result of government-sporLsored planting,
to reach a peak of 220,000 ac in 1969.  The total acreage has declined in
recent years and is now estimated at about 200,000 ac. The main rubber
growing area is the Tenasserim salient, comprising Mon State and Tenasserim
1/ Including livestock, forestry and fisheries which together account for
8 to 9% of GDP at current prices.



-3-
Division, which accounts for about 86% of the rubber area. The remainder is
scattered in the less ecologically suitable areas north and northwest of the
Tenasserim salient. Only about 58% of the total planted area is currently
being exploited, with the balance either immature or abandoned. The aban-
doned rubber is generally over-aged and unproductive although some poten-
tially productive rubber may have been abandoned because of security
problems.
2.06      The private sector comprising smallholders 1/ with about 54% of the
total area and private estates with about 26%, together control about 159,000
ac with about 95,000 ac currently exploited. The remaining 20% or about
40,000 ac is controlled by GOB's Agriculture Corporation (AC) which owns and
operates 22 government estates.
2.07      Rubber yields in Burma currently average about 300 lbs per tapped
acre which is about 60% of the World average. Total annual rubber production
over the past decade has fluctuated around 15,000 tons, equivalent to about
0.4% of the world total. Official exports of rubber from Burma have averaged
about 8,000 tons annually since 1965/66 although there has been considerable
fluctuation between years. These exports have contributed an average of
US$5.7 M per year since FY1972/73, representing approximately 2.9% of total
exports. These statistics exclude quantities of rubber smuggled out of
Burma, most of which originate from smallholdings in the southern half of
Tenasserim Division where there is relatively easy access to Malaysia by sea
and to Thailand by land.
2.08      Government involvement in the rubber industry through the agency of
the Agriculture Corporation takes the following form:
(a)  dire,zt production on government estates which account for 17% of
total production;
(b)  procurement of rubber as the sole legal buyer in Burma;
(c)  provlsion of very limited supplies of inputs and occasional advice
to ruibber producers; and
(d)  marketing of all rubber whether for export or for domestic consump-
tion.
Thus, although GOB contributes only a small share of production, it controls
the industry through iits monopoly purchasing power.
1/ Smallholders are defined as having less than 100 ac. The latest data on
ownership (1963) indicate that there were 14,250 smallholdings and only
200 plantat:ions larger than 100 ac).



-4-
2.09      Rubber production on private estates, and to a lesser extent on
smallholdings, has declined largely due to failure to replace overaged trees
for various reasons, including unavailability of improved planting material,
private sector- concern over possible nationalization and lack of financial
incentives.
2.10      The shortage of planting material would be progressively eliminated
with the establishment of budwood gardens and nurseries under the proposed
project. Provision oL financial incentives is a complex isEsue because of the
incidence of illegal exports particularly in the South due to relatively easy
access to Thailand and Malaysia.  Government is reluctant to provide incen-
tives for replanting wihich would be recovered by a cess on rubber exports
as is done in Thailand and Malaysia because of the possibility of illegal
exports which would escape the cess. Similar problems could arise in a
credit program.  Price incentives although desirable would not solve the
problem because of the attractiveness of exporting rubber illegally and
converting the foreign exchange earned abroad to import consumer goods for
which there is a ready market. To obtain a better understanding of this
issue, the proposed project includes provision for a socio-economic study,
which, inter alia, would investigate possible incentive systems which could
stimulate replanting.
2.11      Given GOB's objective of expanding production on government estates
and considering the existing constraints to rehabilitation in the private
sector, support for the public sector offers the best opportunity for suc-
cessful rehabilitation of the industry at this stage.
IDA Involvement
2.12      IDA has encouraged GOB's recognition of the priority for agricul-
tural development. Since 1973, 19 IDA credits totalling US$517.1 M equiv-
alent (net of cancellation) have been approved for Burma, 54% of which was
for agriculture. The agricultural projects include a large multipurpose dam,
small pumps for lift irrigation, livestock development, paddyland develop-
ment, seed production, rubber rehabilitation, forestry, wood industries, and
grain storage.
2.13      IDA approved, a credit for US$4.5 M for the first Rubber Rehabilita-
tion Project in March 1979. The project became effective in May 1979 and is
scheduled for closing in December 1984, one year beyond the originally
planned date.



-5-
Project Background
2.14      The proposed project would support the second phase of a rubber
rehabilitation program. The first project provided the foundation for
rehabilitation of the industry by modernization of government-owned estates
through physical investment, staff training and technical assistance.
2.15      Principal features of the first project were (a) rehabilitating 15
government-owned estates by replacing old equipment, replanting 3,375 ac of
unproductive rubber trees, planting 1,125 new acres and introducing modern
exploitation practices; (b) rehabilitating a crumb rubber factory; and
(c) staff development and research.
2.16      Management performance during the first project was satisfactory.
By November 1982 almost all machinery, equipment and vehicles had been
procured. Civil works and training were almost completed and the planting
program was 78Z of the target. Apart from the delay in the planting program,
the major item outstanding was the conversion of the crumb rubber factory at
Thanbyuzayat. This has been delayed due to problems with equiipment during
test drilling for the development of the water supply.
2.17      This proposed second project is an expansion of the first project.
The preparation report was a joint effort between the Rubber Section (RS) of
the Plantation Crop Division (PCD) of the Agricultural Corpoiration (AC) and
the consulting firm of Harrisons Fleming Advisory Services (HFAS) as provided
for under the terms of reference of the consultants who were engaged to
provide technical assistance for the first project.

III. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
3.01      The proposed project, planned to cover a six year period, would
build on the foundation laid down in the first project. The major objective
would be to expand Burma's rubber production, hence exports and foreign
exchange earnings, while continuing the institutional strengthening begun
under the firsit project. This would be achieved by bringing to maturity the
4,500 ac of high yielding rubber established in the first project, further
rehabilitation and expansion of government-owned estates, staff training and
continuation oE the research program. The principal features of the project
would be:
(a)  Estate Rehabilitation and Expansion
(i) establish a total of 8,000 ac of high yield:Lng rubber
on 8 existing government estates to replace overaged
trees (6,100 ac) and to expand estate area by new
plantings (1,900 ac);
(ii) establish one new 3,000 ac estate at Sonsin in the
Tenasserim Division.
(iii)  provision of machinery, equipment, vehicles, factories,
offices, and staff quarters for estate rehatilitiation
and new development.
(b) Completion oi- Phase I
(i) bring to maturity the 4,500 ac planted under the
first project.
(c) Technical Assistance and Staff Training
(i) limited staff recruitment and a training
program to support planned expansion of estates.
(ii)  provision of 34 man-months of technical assistance.
(iii)  provision of 96 man-months of post-graduate training
overseas.
(iv)  provision of 16 man-months of short courses overseas.



-7-
(iv) provision of 35 man-months of group training,
conferences and seminars overseas.
(d) Research
(i) establish a foliar analysis laboratory.
(ii) implemient a program of adaptive research, including
field trials and laboratory investigations.
B. The Project Area
3.02      The project would cover nine government estates.  Seven of these
estates --Eighth Mile, Katan, Nyaungbinkwin (NBK), Shwedu, Mayongon, Mudon
and Thanbyuzayat --were in the first project which involved a total of 15
estates. The eighth estate--Sittang Valley (SVRE) is located at a latitude
of about 18 degrees north, 112 miles northeast of Rangoon in Pegu Division
(see Map).
3.03      The ninth estate, Sonsin, would be a new development.  It is
located at a latitude of about 14 degrees north, between mileposts 29 and 34,
south of Tavoy, on the road leading to another estate, Yange. Sonsin extends
over 6,000 acres on both sides of the road and is a prime target for develop-
ment in GOB's Fourth Four-Year Development Plan. Developing this estate
would not in'volve dispossessing farmers. On the contrary, it would con-
tribute to the economic development of the region.  At full development, the
estate would create about 750 new jobs.
3.04      The eight existing estates to be developed under the project
include about 20,000 ac of rubber and comprise about 50% of the total area of
government estates or about 10% of the total rubber area in Burma.  Under the
project, it is proposed to replant a total of 6,100 ac and to plant an addi-
tional 4,900 ac of rubber. The area proposed for replanting was established
before World War II and yields no longer justify the cost of maintenance and
tapping.
3.05      The project area ranges in latitude from 100 to 180 north.  Its
suitability for rubber cultivation decreases from south to north reflecting
the lengthening of the dry season. However, the disadvantage of a lengthen-
ing dry season as one goes from south to north is partly compensated for in
the reduced incidence of Phytophthora.
3.06      The climate in the project area is dominated by the Southwest
monsoon which extends from May to September with July being the wettest
month.  The annual rainfall ranges from an average of 128 inches at Sittang
Valley, which is the most northerly estate, to 215 inches in the south. The



.       ~~-8-
dry season varies from four to five months, increasing from south to north.
The temperature variation is small with mean daily temperatures ranging from
850F in March to 800F in December. The combination of high rainfall and
humidity and cool temperatures during the wet season results in widespread
fungal attacks, Phytophthora being most damaging. The intense rainfall
during the wet season prevents tapping for three to four months and the trees
are normally rested for a month between January and February (luring winter-
ing.
3.07      The soils in the project area are all suitable for growing rubber.
Rubber is already being grown on eight of the nine estates. In the new area,
Sonsin, the soi:L falls within Class I classification as defined in Burma's
land use manual.  Sonsin is a gently undulating area varying from 50 to 100
feet above sea level.  Vegetation consists of secondary forest following
shifting cultivation. Land clearing would present no problems.
3.08      The total population of about 2.2 M in the project area is dis-
tributed unevenly with 1.4 M and a population density of 295 per sq mi in
Mon state compared with a population of 0.8 M and a density oi 46 per sq mi
in Tenasserim Division. Tenasserim Division has little lowland and consists
mainly of hilly or mountainous areas together with numerous islands. It is a
rice deficit area although rice is the major crop: upland and wet rice
account for 45% of the cultivated area and rubber 21%. Fishing, tin mining,
forest exploitation, and bamboo collection offer employment opportunities in
addition to the trading activities afforded by an extensive unofficial
market.  Wage rates are generally higher than those prevailing further north
and range from K 8 to K 15 per day. Government estate workers are supplied
with rice and kerosene at controlled prices in addition to the fixed Govern-
ment wage of K 6.5 per day. In recent years, insurgency has been kept under
close control in the project area, but foreigners are still required to
travel with police or army escorts outside the major towns.
3.09    Mon State has extensive low lying areas suited to rice cultivation
and produces a rice surplus for export. The total area under major crops is
about 950,000 ac, of which 71% is rice and 8% rubber. Employment oppor-
tunities are more restricted than in Tenasserim Division and apart from
agriculture, the main activities are firewood collection, bamboo and timber
extraction, cottage industries and petty trading. Market wage rates are
around the national average ranging from K 5 to K 12 per day.
3.10      The project area is served by different modes of transport, depend-
ing on location. In Mon State, the predominant method of rubber transport to
procurement centers and also to Rangoon is by truck although a small amount
moves by rail. In the Tenasserim Division, the predominant method in the
Tavoy area is by truck. In Mergui, all deliveries to procurement centers in
Mergui West are made by water while transport to centers in Mergui East is by
road as well as water. All shipments from procurement centers in Tavoy and
Mergui to Rangoon are made by water. All rubber produced in Burma passes



-9-
through Rangoon because Rangoon is the only port through which rubber may be
legally exported.
3.11    Good communication is maintained between the project headquarters in
Rangoon and project estates. Radio/telephone links have been established
with estates in Tavoy and Mergui. Telephone service is available between
Rangoon and estates in Mudon and Thanbyuzayat.
C. Detailed Features of the Project
Estate Rehabilitation and Expansion
3.12      Phasing.  The project would replant 6,100 ac overaged trees and
establish 4,900 ac of new rubber over six years. Actual planting in the
field would be phased over five years commencing in the second year. The
process from clear felling to planting of each area would be phased over two
years. Clear felling, soil conservation and road construction would begin in
the first year. Planting in the field would begin in the second year. Table
3.1 summarizes the planting program.

3.13      Planting Material.  Rubber industry practice is to graft selected
clonal material to seedling stocks. However, about 42% of the planting
material used in the first project was from seeds imported from Malaysia
because of the unavailability of budwood locally, and the relative inex--
perience of local staff. Local staff has gained considerable experience from
the first project and adequate supplies of budwood are now available. It is
therefore proposed to make the transition from imported seed to locally
produced budgrafted material in the second project. Recourse would be had to
imported material only if difficulties arise. The clonal composition of
planting material would be 50% of GT I and 10% each of RRIM 6DO, PB 235,
PB 260, PR 255 and PR 261. Provision would also be made for some new clones
for test planting.
3.14      GT I is the most reliable high yielding clone, with considerable
tolerance to Phytophthora; RRIM 600, despite its susceptibility to Phytoph-
thora gives high yields in Thailand; PB 235, PB 260, PR 255 and PR 261 have
all given good yields in Thailand combined with a useful degree of Phytoph-
thora tolerance.
3.15      Planting and Establishment.  Project staff have gained sufficient
experience with the production of budgrafted seedlings during the first
project to enable them to successfully establish the acreage forecasted under
the proposed project. Planting material would be produced by the
green-budding of seedlings raised in nurseries, and transplan-ting the suc-
cessfully buddel plants to polythene bags for subsequent field planting.
Planting and establishment operations would include nursery work, land clear-
ing, soil conservation, field planting, weeding, fertilizing, pest and dis-
ease control, pruning, fencing, fire protection and establishing legume
cover. Plantinly and establishment costs are provided in Annex 1, Tables 5-9.
3.16      Exploitation Practices.  Exploitation practices introduced in the
first project would be continued, with upward tapping in the upper panels of
older trees, latex stimulation using ethrel or its equivalent, and improved
husbandry, including manuring on all potentially productive mature trees.
A foliar analysis laboratory would be established under the project. When
established, the rates of fertilizer application would be adjusted annually
on the basis of the preceding season-s leaf analysis results. Unlike the
first project, it is proposed to apply ethrel or its equivalenit from the
first year of tapping, instead of the ninth.
3.17      Civil Works.  The civil works program would continue the process of
rehabilitation and expansion of facilities on eight existing estates. One
new estate would be established at Sonsin. The program would build 103
houses for staff as well as 2 factories, 6 smokehouses and 7 offices. The
purpose of prov:Lding staff accommodation is to improve the standard and
increase the number in order to encourage a community spirit on rubber
estates. Accommodation is especially necessary on isolated estates where



-11-
labor shortages occur. The objective is for each estate to have a nucleus of
trained workers and tappers resident on the estate. Details of the civil
works program are presented in Annex 1, Table 1.
3.18      Machinery, Equipment and Vehicles.  Farm equipment such as trac-
tors, plows, harrows and sprayers would be provided for estate maintenance.
Chainsaws would be prov:Lded for land clearing. Road graders would be
provided for road construction and maintenance.  Sprinkler irrigation systems
would be installed in nurseries to ensure the proper growth of seedlings.
Provision would be made for sheeting batteries and ancillary equipment com-
prising coagulation tanks and baling presses for factory rehabilitation and
expansion. The transportation system on estates would be improved by provid-
ing tractors, trailers, and trucks.  Managers of larger estates (e.g., Mayon-
gon, Mudon and Sittang Valley) would be provided with jeep-type vehicles,
while managers of small estates and supervisory field staff would be provided
with motorcycles and bicycles. Details of machinery equipment and vehicles
are shown in Annex 1, Table 1.
Completion of Phase I
3.19      Rubber trees come into production about 7 or 8 years; after plant-
Ing. The first project provided financing for only about 50 percent of the
cost of establishing the 4,500 acres covered as planting was phased over 5
years and the trees wouJd not attain maturity before the project ended. The
proposed project would extend the support to the first project to provide
estate supplies (fertilizers, weedicides, pesticides, etc.) and labor (for
weeding, fertilizing, spraying, etc.) to maintain the trees until they begin
to produce.
Technical Assistance and Staff Training
3.20      During appraisal agreement was reached in principle with GOB staff
and the representatives of FAO and UNDP that the technical assistance and
training component of the proposed IDA project would be financed mainly under
a proposed UNDP Plantation Crop Development Project (BUR/81/008) for which
the sum of US$971,692 would be provided to cover rubber artd other plantation
crops.   About US$896,492 would be reserved for the Rubber Section.  Signing
of the agreement between GOB and UNDP is expected to take place in July 1983.
The program would cover four calendar years, spanning five of the six fiscal
years required for implementation of the activities to be financed under the
IDA project. GOB contribution to the UNDP program for rubber would amount
the equivalent of US$102,641 and would cover local mission travel for con-
sultants, administrative support, in-service training'of local staff and
miscellaneous items of equipment. GOB gave an assurance that in the event
that the UNDP Project Document failed to become effective by Oatober 31, 1983
or by such later date as the Association may agree, GOB would establish to
the satisfaction of the Association that adequate funds for the project would



-12-
be available from other sources on terms and conditions consistent with its
obligations under the Development Credit Agreement.
3.21      The total provision for technical assistance would be 40
man-months. The proposed UNDP program would provide for a tot:al of 34
man-months of technical assistance, 24 man-months for a resident Chief Tech-
nical Adviser and 10 man-months for miscellaneous short-term consultancies.
To ensure access to such assistance as may be required during the sixth and
final year of the IDA project, provision would be made under the credit for
an additional 6 man-months of consultant time.  The UNDP Project is scheduled
to commence fron January 1984 for 4 years.  The full-time appointment of the
Chief Technical Advisor would be effective from January 1985 so as to avoid
having two different groups of foreign consultants in Burma at the same time
- HFAS for Phase I and FAO for Phase II. However, to ensure that the
proposed project takes off without complications UNDP would arrange for the
potential candi6ate for the CTA to visit Burma in October 1983 and again in
April/May 1984. GOB gave an assurance that prior to the appointment of the
Chief Technical Advisor, it would furnish to the Association for comment (i)
the proposed terms of reference of such advisor and (ii) the qualifications
of proposed candidates ior the position.  The appointee is expected to be a
highly experienced rubber specialist preferably with special knowledge of
plantation development work--production of clonal planting material, budwood
gardens, nursery techniques, field establishment, etc.  He would also be
expected to play a major role in staff development and training with atten-
tion being paid to the development of management skills as well as agronomic
practices. The additional 10 man-months of consultant services to be
recruited on an ad hoc basis as required, would provide technical assistance;
to assist in planning for continuing rehabilitation of the industry; to
advise on pathology problems, particularly Phytophtora but also Oidium and
various nursery diseases, research methodology, processing and marketing; and
to establish a foliar analysis service. US$ 20,000 would also be provided
under the UNDP project for local consultants to undertake a socio-economic
survey of the industry. The phasing of the technical assistance program is
presented in Annex 3 ChaLrt 3.
3.22      The proposed UNDP training program would provide 96 manmonths of
overseas fellowships and! training programs for 4 national staff leading to
the award of post-graducLte degrees in plant pathology, tree crop agronomy,
soil science/plant nutrition and plant breeding. Sixteen man-months of short
courses overseas would be provided for eight staff to cover weed science,
project implementation, soil/foliar analysis and management for trainers.
Thirty-two man-months wculd be provided for group training overseas for 14
staff to cover estate management, clone identification, rubber cultivation
and research. Three mar-months would be provided for six staff to attend
conferences and seminars overseas. Local in-service training on various
aspects of estate practice would continue to be provided at the Mudon Train-
ing Center and elsewhere. Details of the training program are presented in
Annex 3, Table 5. GOB gave an assurance that it would discuss with the



-13-
Association annually but not later than January 1, 1984 and April 1 of each
subsequent year, its proposed overseas training program for staff of RS.
3.23      Research.  The total size of Burma's rubber industry and the
demands of other crops impose constraints on the resources that can be allo-
cated to research on rubber. However, this need not impede development of
the rubber industry for there is a wealth of research information available
from nearby rubber-producing countries which could be profitably adapted to
the Burmese environment. While devising effective means of controlling
Phytophthora Is probably the most challenging task facing the research
department, quicker returns may be expected from the establislment of a
rational fertilizer policy. To this end a foliar analysis laboratory would
be established. The laboratory would be expected to serve the needs of oil
palm and other plantation crops as well as rubber. Routine leaf sampling and
analyses wou'ld allow thie monitoring of nutrient status of the trees and
enable management to make economies in fertilizer applications. The modest
program on non-pathology agronomic aspects of research begun in the first
project would continue and would include selection of planting material,
plant nutrition studies tapping and stimulation and crop husbandry. Work on
Phytophtora leaf fall and pod rot would continue with emphasis on tackling
the problems of immediate practical importance.
3.24      The Rubber Research Program initiated under the first project would
be developed by RS in conjunction with the Chief Technical Adviser. GOB gave
an assurance that until the completion of the project, RS would submit
annually to the Associaltion for its review and comment (i) by December 31 of
each year, beginning December 1984, a five year research program for the
current and following four years, the first such plan to cover the period
April 1, 1984 to ièarch 31, 1989, and (ii) by June 30 of each year beginning
June 30, 1985, an annual research report covering the period April 1 to March
31 of each year, and detailing RS's research activities to date, its findings
and its proposed future research activities.
D. Implementation
3.25      Rubber Section would be responsible for implementation of the
project which is expected to be completed within six years, by about Septemr
ber 30, 1989. The phasing of planting is shown in Table 3.1 while that of
technical assistance andL training is in Annex 3, Table 5. The most critical
aspect of project implementation would be nursery establishment and produc-
tion of budgrafted seedlings, particularly during the first two years,
because seedfall does not occur until July/August and seedlings must be ready
for budgrafting in Janua,ry.

E. Cost Estimates
3.26      The project is estimated to cost US$13.67 M, including import
duties and taxes (US$1.47 M), physical contingencies (US$0.50 M), and price
contingencies (US$2.02 M). Foreign exchange costs would be about US$5.90 M
or 43% of total costs. Costs were based on prices prevailing at the end of
1982 and were updated to July 1983 levels. Physical contingencies amount to
roughly 4% of base costs and were estimated at 10% for civil works and 5% for
planting and maintenance costs.  Price contingencies represent 17% of base
costs plus physical contingencies. Price contingencies for local currency
costs were estimated at an annual inflation rate of 4% throughout the
implementation period. Price contingencies for foreign currency costs were
estimated on the basis of annual inflation rates of 8% in 1983, 7.5% in 1984,
7% in 1985, and 6% in each year between 1986 and 1989. Cost estimates are
detailed in Annex 1, Tables 1-4 and are summarized in Table 3.2.

F. Financing
3.27      The proposed IDA credit of US$9.0 M would finance about 74% of the
total project cost excluding duties and taxes. The Credit would cover 85%
(US$5.00 M) of foreign costs, the balance being met by UNDP (US$0.90 M).  It
would also cover 51% (US$4.00 M) of local costs including duties and taxes.
GOB would finance the equivalent of US$3.77 M. This sum included provision
for the equivalent of US$0.10 M for GOB commitment under the UNDP Plantation
Crop Development Program to provide miscellaneous equipment, local mission
travel and local administration support for the rubber component of that
project. The proposed project financing is summarized in Table 3.3. Further
details are in Annex 1, Table 15.

G. Procurement
3.28      RS would be responsible for all procurement under the project.  The
cost of machinery, equipment and vehicles would be about US$1.8 M, including
price escalation but nel: of duties and taxes. Items such as generators, road
graders, sprayers, rubber processing equipment and equipment for a foliar
analysis laboratory would be procured through ICB in accordance with IDA
guidelines. A 15% preference margin, or the prevailing customs duty,
whichever is lower, would be extended to local manu'facturers in bid evalua-
tion under ICB procurement. Equipment costing the equivalent of US$50,000 or
less for each contract such as water pumps, bailing press boxes, oil storage
tanks, trolleys, rails, tractors, trailers and office equipment, and which
would not be suitable for ICB would be procured under local procedures



-17-
acceptable to IDA.  Such purchases would be limited to US$0.6 M.  A detailed
equipment list is given in Annex 1, Table 1.
3.29       Civil works estimated to cost about US$1.9 M would comprise a
large number of relativiely small works widely scattered throughout the
project area and would not be suitable for ICB. RS would be responsible for
the construction of buildings with a unit cost of less than K 100,000 using
its own staff or locally-hired tradesmen. The Construction Corporation (CC)
would be responsible for civil works costing more than K 100,000. GOB would
ensure that the necessary building materials were made available to RS in a
timely manner inI order to allow RS to carry out such works.  These buildings
and works, would include houses, offices, factories and factory extensions,
sheds and godowns, water tanks, roads and bridges and fencing on estates.
RS would, not later than January of each year, beginning JanuaLry 1984, and
until completioni of the civil works to be carried out under the project,
submit to IDA for its review and comment an annual work plan covering the
civil works to be executed during each year.
3.30      Estate supplies (US$4.5 M) including fencing materials, agricul-
tural chemicals, fertilizers and nursery supplies would be available for
procurement through ICB in accordance with IDA guidelines. A 15% preference
margin, or the prevailing customs duty whichever is lower, would be extended
to local manufacturers in bid evaluation under ICB procurement. Contracts
for supplies estimated to cost the equivalent of US$50,000 or less would be
procured after comparing prices from not less than three independent sup-
pliers in accordance with GOB procurement procedures acceptable to IDA.
3.31      Consultants (US$0.38 M) for the technical assistance program would
be recruited jo:Lntly by GOB and FAO. GOB gave an assurance that it would
employ appropriately qualified consultants under terms and conditions satis-
factory to GOB and the Association. The training program would be
administered by RS and FAO following GOB procedures.
3.32     Draft tender documents for all ICB contracts estimated to cost over
US$100,000 would be submitted to IDA for review prior to issue of bidding
documents. GOB would submit to IDA its recommendation for award of contracts
following such tenders, prior to award of the contracts. For all other
contracts, GOB would submit copies of the contract together with the recom-
mendations on which the award is made, prior to application for withdrawal of
funds from the credit with respect to such contracts.
H. Disbursements
3.33      Disbursements from the credit are expected to be completed by March
31, 1990, approximately six months after the end of project implementation.
The estimated schedule is in Annex 1, Table 12. Estimates of disbursements
are based on experience derived from the first project, disbursements from



*       ~~~-18--
which are expected to be completed one year after original target.  The main
reasons for the delay are problems with the supply of budwood and delay in
the construction of the crumb rubber factory due to problems with equipment
during test drilling for the development of the water supply (para 2.16).
The proposed project has no major civil works such as the crumb rubber fac-
tory, and planting material would be provided locally, hence it is expected
that disbursements would be completed as indicated.  Disbursements from the
proposed credit would cover:
(a)  equipment, estate supplies and chemicals;
(i) directly imported-100% of foreign expenditures;
(ii)  locallv manufactured-100% of local expenditures
(ex-factory); and
(iii)  locally procured-70% of other local expenditures.
(b) civil works-70% of local expenditures;
(i) force account; and
(ii) contracted.
(c)  project field operating costs for planting and establishment--70%
of local expenditures; and
(d)  technical assistance for six man-months--lOOZ
3.34      Applications for disbursements from the credit would be fully
documented except for Items (bi) and (c) of Paragraph 3.33 which would be
carried out by RS using its own staff. Disbursements under Items (bi) and
(c) would be made against statements of expenditures (SOE) certified by the
General Manager, PCD or a nominee acceptable to IDA. Documentation support-
ing SOE would be retained by RS for review during project supervision.
3.35      The project haLs been designed as a second phase of a program to
develop the rubber industry. Upon completion of the project, any surplus
remaining in the credit account may, at the discretion of IDA and following a
GOB request, be used for program related expenditures.
I. Accounts and Audits
3.36      All Government agencies maintain accounts in accordance with proce-
dures laid down by the Ministry of Planning and Finance (MPF). The Rubber
Section and its estates currently operate a satisfactory accounting system.



-19-
The Central Audit and Inspection Office, acting on behalf of the Central
Council of People's Inspectors, is responsible for auditing the accounts of
Government agencies, and would be acceptable to IDA as an independent auditor
for this project.
3.37      GOB gave an assurance that:
(a) each project estate would maintain separate accounts which clearly
identified project related activities;
(b) RS head office would maintain separate accounts for its project
related activities;
(c) RS would collaLte estate accounts and consolidate these with head
office accounts and accounts for all other RS activities to
produce, inter alia;
(M) a statement showing sources and uses of funds;
(ii) an income and expenditure statement; and
(iii) a balance sheet.
(d) these accounts would be audited annually by an independent auditor
and in accordance with procedures satisfactory to IDA. (The audit
report would include, inter alia, a statement that funds disbursed
against statements of expenditure had been used for the purpose for
which they were provided);
Ce)  RS would send to IDA copies of the summary of the unaudited project
account within six months of the end of each fiscal year, to be
followed by copies of the audited accounts and auditorΩs report
when completed but not more than nine months from the end of each
fiscal year.
IV.  ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
General
4.01      The Government rubber estates are managed by the Rubber Section
(RS) of the Plantation Crop Division (PCD), a division of the ligriculture
Corporation (AC) under the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests (MAF). The
PCD was formally created by GOB on June 1, 1981 and has two sections --
Rubber and Oil Palm, the latter being also responsible for coconut and cocoa.
The PCD is responsible for all aspects of rubber, oil palm, coconut and cocoa
production in both the State and private sectors. The Rubber and Oil Palm



-20-
Sections are responsible only for production of their respective crops. They
are served by five support divisions within PCD - Procurement and Distribu-
tion 1/, Administration and Accounts, Extension, Research and Training, and
Engineering.  Field operations are monitored and coordinated within four
geographical regions. Inder the project three of these regions - Mon,sTavoy
and Mergui - would each have one Regional Manager and one Assistant Regional
Manager. These regional managers would have responsibilities for Oil Palm as
well as Rubber. The PCD organization is illustrated in Annex 3, Chart 1.
4.02      Staffing.  The project would continue the program of staff recruit-
ment and development initiated under the first project. The creation of the
Plantation Crop Division recommended under the first project has been imple-
mented and all but two senior management posts have been filled. Staff have
been assigned temporarily to these two posts. A further modest reorganiza-
tion of managerial posts would be introduced under the project. At head-
quarters, two posts for Deputy Assistant General Managers wouldl be upgraded
to Deputy General Managers, and positions would be created for five Assistant
General Managers. At the regional level, positions would be created for
three Regional Managers and three Assistant Regional Managers. The build-up
of PCD head office and regional staff is shown in Annex 3, Table 1. Staff
requirement norms would be established for the Government estates. Estates
larger than 4,000 ac have one Estate Manager I, one Estate Manager II, and
two Deputy Assistant Managers. Estates between 3,000 - 4,000 ac would have
one less Deputy Assistant Manager.  Estates between 2,000 - 3,000 ac would
have one Estate Manager II and one Deputy Assistant Manager; estates between
1,000 - 2,000 ac would have only one Estate Manager III; and estates between
500 - 1,000 ac would have one Deputy Estate Manager.  Staffing norms for
project Government estates are show in Annex 3, Table 3.  This staff struc-
ture would allow for more and higher caliber managerial staff as the planted
areas of the estates increase. It would permit some delegation of authority
within larger estates in that deputy managers would be placed :Ln virtual
control of separate divisions of the estates. More importantly, it would
create a pool of Junior managers who would be well qualified to fill the
management positions that would arise as the industry develops.
Headquarters
4.03      Project implementation would be the responsibility oEL the Rubber
Section of PCD. The project manager would be the head of the Rubber Section
Production Department with the rank of a Deputy General Managei] of PCD.  The
proposed structure of RS/PCD is illustrated in the Organization Chart in
Annex 3, Chart l. The project manager would be directly responsible to the
General Manager, PCD, who reports to the Managing Directc,r of AC.
1/ The Procurement and Distribution Division is responsible for export and
local marketing of all rubber produced in Burma.



-21-
4.04      The project manager would coordinate all headquarters, regional and
estate activities. He would also coordinate input supplies to the government
estates in conjunction with the regional managers and estate managers, each
of whom would submit requirements to headquarters as part of the annual
budget and work program. He would inspect project estates accompanied by the
appropriate regional manager on a regular basis and he would be responsible
for the preparation of quarterly progress reports on the project.
4.05      Headquarters Accounts and Administration staff would be responsible
for collation of estate budgets and accounts and preparation of consolidated
RS budgets and accounts. One Senior Accounts Officer assisted by other
accounts staff would be responsible for the projects accounts, procurement
and disbursements.
4.06      Each estate with the help of Headquarters staff would annually
prepare a five-year development plan for the current and following four
years. These plans would include details of the physical deve:Lopments in
addition to annual income and expenditure budgets. The plans i:or each estate
would be amalgamated into a five-year development plan for RS.  GOB gave an
assurance that until the completion of the project, RS would submit to the
Association not later than April 1 of each year commencing 1984, a five-year
development plan prepared on the basis of five year development plans sub-
mitted by each project estate in respect of its activities for the current
and following four years, outlining RS's income and expenditure budget and
planned physical activities pertaining to rubber for the current and follow-
ing years.
Field Operations
4.07      Project implementation in the field would be the responsibility of
regional managers (Mon, Tavoy, and Mergui) and estate managers.  Regional
managers would have dual responsibilities for rubber and oil palm production
and marketing.  Each would have an assistant who would be responsible for
rubber procurement thus allowing regional managers to concentrate on project
activities.  Regional managers would be responsible for monthly inspection of
project estates and would accompany the project manager on routine inspection
of estates and other estate supplies. They would ensure that adequate stocks
of agro-chemicals, and fertilizers and other estate supplies are kept in
regional and estate stores and they would liaise with State/Divisional
Authorities regarding security and the supply of building imaterials and
labor. Each estate would have an estate manager who would be responsible for
all aspects of estate management. The rank of the estate manager and the
number and rank of assistant managers on estates would depend on the size of
the estate (paLra 4.02).



-22-
Monitoring and Project Completion Report
4.08      Project performance would be continually monitored by an internal
monitoring unit set up in head office. This unit would consist of a
full-time monitoring officer and a full-time field monitor. Tlhese officers
would be assisted by staff from the Accounts and Administration Section of RS
as required. Project operations would be restricted to the Government
estates in the project area and would be monitored using the existing estate
recording system supplemented by specific field observations as necessary.
The Project Manager would assist RS staff in constantly developing the
project monitoring system.
4.09      RS would be responsible for the preparation of the Project Comple-
tion Report (PCR). It is expected that RS would be assisted by GOB's Project
Appraisal and Progress Reporting Department (PAPRD). This exiSting depart-
ment also monitors projects and would advise the monitoring unit within RS of
its monitoring activities to ensure that data collected by RS are consistent
in form and relevant to the needs of PAPRD for evaluation purposes.
V. -PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND PRICES
Production
5.01      Production of rubber from the project is forecast to rise from 64
tons in FY1990/91, when the first 400 ac planted in the South comes into
tapping, to a maximum of 6,513 tons in FY2005/2006, when the total 11,000 ac
attains peak production (Annex 2 Table 4). Trees are projected to remain in
tapping for 31 years in the North and 32 years in the South. Within this
period total production would be 176,000 tons. Yields from the South are
forecast to rise from 364) lb/ac DRC (Dry Rubber Content) to a maximum of
1,400 lb/ac inI the tenth year of tapping, remain constant through the six-
teenth year and decline gradually thereafter (Annex 2, Table 1). Trees in
the North would yield less and would come into tapping one year later than
the South with a yield oE 320 lb/ac rising to a peak of 1,250 lb/ac in the
tenth year of tapping and decline gradually from the seventeent:h year.
World Markets
5.02      Natural rubber (NR) is a typical export commodity:  exports account
for about 90% of world production. Domestic utilization of natural rubber in
the main producing countries still represents a small even if growing per-
centage of total product:Lon: 7.7% in 1981 as compared with 4.5% in 1972-74.
Synthetic rubbers (SR) on the other hand are, for the most part, used in
producing courntries: gross exports account for about 26.2% of world produc-
tion in 1981.



-23-
5.03      The growth of world rubber demand is determined to a large extent
by the growth in automotive and other industrial uses in the industrialized
countries where utilization during the past 30 years grew at about 6% per
annum. Rubber demand grew even faster in centrally planned economies and
developing countries at 7 and 10% per annum respectively -- but from a much
smaller base. Industria'Lized countries in 1979 accounted for 59% of total
world elastomer consumption (29% of NR and 71% of SR), centrally planned
countries for 26% (23% of NR and 77% of SR) and developing countries for the
remaining 15% (48% of NR and 52% of SR). Annex 2 , Table 7 shows consumption
of natural rubbers and total elastomers, by main economic regions. 1/
5.04      The global production potential of NR for the next four to five
years is considered adequate to meet the expected growth in demand. However,
available data on the exiLsting area planted with rubber, currently available
production technology, as well as new planting and replanting programs in
producing countries, poinit to the possibility of a decline in the rate of NR
output during the 1985-95 period. This mainly reflects the expected slowdown
in rubber production in M4alaysia, the biggest NR producing and exporting
country, where labor shortages have increasingly become a problem and where
competition from other tree crops, particularly oil palm remains strong.
Greater potential for increasing NR output exists in Indonesia and Thailand,
the two other major producing countries, as well as among minor producers
such as Burma. However, this is not expected to offset the Malaysian
decline, hence the expecl:ed price improvement (para 5.09).
Domestic Market
5.05      The Agricultural Corporation is the sole legal buyer of raw rubber
in Burma. During FY1981/82, it purchased 13,457 tons of raw rubber from
private estates. Of this amount, RSS#l accounted for 17%, lower grade RSS,
41%; and field grades, 41%. Production from Government estates in FY1981/82
amounted to 2,728 tons. RSS#l accounted for 37%, lower grade RSS, 37%; and
field grades and scrap, 17%. Sales of rubber for local manufacture amounted
to 1,488 tons in FY1981/82.
5.06      The rubber consumed in Burma is used primarily for bicycle tires
and tubes, shoes and slippers, retread compounds and other rubber products.
A new factory under const:ruction near Moulmein will consume some 5,000 tons
of rubber annually for tire manufacture. The raw material used. will be a
blend of medium grade RSS and SMR 20. Based on GOB's Fourth Four Year Plan
domestic consumption of rubber is projected to reach 6,500 tons by 1985/86.
1/ Reference Table II-BI from Rubber Handbook, February 1981.



-24-
Exports
5.07      Burma produces only about 0.4% of world output of natural rubber
and finding export markets has not been a problem. Exports from Burma rose
from 9,505 tons in FY 1979/80 to 12,726 tons in FY 1981/82.
5.08      While significant rehabilitation of private sector rubber is not to
be expected without financial support from Government, some spontaneous
replanting is actually taking place. Private sector production together with
production from non-project estates would continue to meet the requirements
of the domestic market and allow for some export.  Thus project output would
be available for export. Finding markets would not be a problem.
Price Projections
5.09      Both demand and supply of natural rubber are quite insensitive to
price changes in the short-term, with wide price fluctuations occurring when
changes in economic activity induce relatively small demand shifts, or when
supply is temporarily reduced. The price of natural rubber recovered from
the depressed price levels of 1975, rising from 99 cents/kg for RSS#1/spot
New York in 1975 to a high of 155 cents/kg in 1980 in 1981 constant prices.
Prices slipped in 1981. However, based on its assumptions regarding expected
increases in petroleum prices, growth in GDP and the other factors which
influence its projections, the Bank in its December 1982 forecast, projected
the price to rise from 125 cents/kg in 1981 to 161 cents in 1995 in 1981
constant prices. Petroleum prices began to fall in February 1983. If this
decline is sustained it is not unlikely that the projected 1995 price of 161
cents/kg would have to be reduced.
5.10      The mission has assumed that the average price to be realized for
rubber produced under the project would be 138 cents/kg in 1981 constant
prices. This is the average price forecast over the 15 year period between
1980 and 1995. The average price between 1970 and 1980 was 135 cents/kg.
Ninety six percent of project output would be produced after 1995.



-25-
5.11      The projected price FOB Rangoon is calculated as follows:
Rubber Price in 1981 Constant Prices        = 138 cents/kg 1/
Rubber Price in 1983 Constant Prices        = 148 cents/kg
Less Insurance and Freight                =  19 cents/kg
Price FOB Rangoon                              129 cents/kg
Price FOB Rangoon at exchange rate
of USI$ -K7.8                             = K4.57/lb
Weighted average price based on price re-
lationship between other grades and RSS#l = K4.51/lb
5.12      Since project output would be exported, the price of K4.51/lb is
used in the financial as well as the economic analysis.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
General Impact
6.01      The project would continue the modernization of Burma's government
estates. The major tangible benefit would be production of rubber from 6,100
ac of replanting and 4,900 ac of new planting. The average yield from these
11,000 acres would be about 1,000 lb per acre compared with Burma's current
yield of about 300 lb. per tapped acre. Production would total over 176,000
tons of dry rubber valued at about US$230 M over the life of the project.
Net foreign exchange earnings would be about US$200 M.
6.02      The project would provide employment totalling about 9,000
man-years for planting and maintenance of rubber trees during the 6-year
implementation period.    Peak employment during the implementation period
would be in Year 5 when over 2,000 jobs would be provided. Additional
employment would also be created for artisans through the construction
program. In the long run, the project would continue to provide additional
employment for present estate workers, many of whom would have lost their
jobs due to declining production, if the estates were not rehabilitated.
Most of the employment opportunities would go to landless families or would
1/ Adjusted by an inflation factor of 7% between 1981 and 1983.



-26-
supplement incomes of families with insufficient land to fully employ family
labor resources.
6.03      The project would broaden the base of development by including two
estates, SVRE and Sonsin, which were not included in the earlier project. It
would be particularly supportive of GOB's efforts to stimulate economic
activity and generate employment in the Sonsin area and would contribute
significantly to improving the security situation of the area.
6.04      The project would pave the way for further rehabilitation and
expansion of the rubber subsector through staff development, and research to
discover higher yielding planting materials and exploitation practices
suitable for Burmese conditions.
6.05      The project is not expected to generate adverse environmental
effects. Processing facilities would incorporate measures for preventing
environmental pollution from factory effluent.
Financial Analysis
6.06      Rubber Section is not an autonomous organization.  It is one of two
sections which make up t'he Plantation Crop Division within the Agriculture
Corporation. Rubber Section's primary function is to produce rubber which it
sells to the Procurement Division of the Plantation Crop Divis:Lon at a price
of K2/lb for RSS grade 1 rubber and lower prices for inferior grades. Rubber
Section is an efficient and profitable organization and it earned profits
averaglng K 3.5 million annually during the last six years of :Lts operation.
Rubber Section's profits are absorbed by the Agriculture Corporation. The
project would be financially very attractive to the Agriculture Corporation
and to the Government of Burma. It would generate net outflows totalling
about US$ 103 million during the first ten years; from year 11 it would
generate inflows which would reach a peak of US$ 46 million in its twentieth
year. The net present value of the project would be about US$ 53.6 million,
assuming an opportunity cost of capital of 10 percent. The int:ernal rate of
return before financing would be about 14 percent. The cost and benefit
streams used to calculate the financial rate of return are shown in Annex 2,
Table 5. Rubber yields are shown in Annex 2, Table 1. Project: output would
be exported at a price of K 4.51/lb (para 5.11). Costs were based on prices
prevailing at the end of 1982 and are updated to mid-1983. Physical contin-
gencies are included at a rate of 5 percent for planting and maintenance
costs and 10 percent of civil works. Price contingencies are excluded. The
analysis is in 1983 consitant prices.
Economic Analysis
6.07      The cost and benefit streams used to calculate the economic rate of
return (ERR) for the project are presented in Annex 2, Table 6. The economic
analysis is in border Kyats in 1983 constant prices. International prices



-27-
are converted to local currency at an exchange rate of US$1 = K 7.8. The
principal assumptions used in preparing the economic analysis are shown
below.
6.08      Project Life.  The project life is assumed to be 43 years.  Trees
are assumed to come into tapping in Year 8 in the South and Year 9 in the
North.  Trees would remain in tapping for 31 years in the north and for 32
years in the South. No residual values are assigned to project investments.
6.09      Prices.  All rubber produced in the project would be exported at a
border price of K4.51/lb calculated at 1983 constant prices (para 5.11).
Project costs include physical contingencies and exclude price contingencies,
duties and taxes. Project inputs consist of mostly tradeables and labor.
The local content of imported goods and local inputs are shadow priced
through the application of a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.8. Shadow
wage rates for labor are, estimated at full market costs as labor is in short
supply in some parts of the project area and the wages and other benefits
provided to laborers represent the minimum inducement required to attract and
retain the desired labor force. The economic cost for labor is derived by
adjusting the market wage rate by the SCF.
6.10      Opportunity Ccst of Capital.  The opportunity cost of capital (OCC)
is assumed to be 10%.
Economic Rate of Return
6.11      The Burmese economy would realize an economic rate of return (ERR)
of about 17%.
Net Present Value
6.12      The net present value (NPV) of the project at an opportunity cost
of capital of 10% would be K83.6 M.
Sensitivity Analysis
6.13    Switching values 1/  were calculated to assess the impact of varia-
tions in cost and benefit streams on the project. The results are summarized
in Annex 2, Table 8. The results indicate that the economic viability of the
project is more sensitive to changes in benefits than to variations in cost.
Assuming an OCC of 10%, total costs would have to rise by 75% but benefits
I/ Switching value is the percentage change in the specified stream (benefit
or cost) that reduces the NPV of the project to zero at a specified
discount rate (10% is assumed for Burma).

would have to fall by only 43% before the project became economically not
viable. Similarly, the project is more sensitive to increases in capital
costs than to increases in recurrent costs. When recurrent costs are broken
down between maintenance costs and direct production costs (tapping and
processing), the project is found to be more sensitive to increases in the
cost of tapping and processing than to maintenance costs. However the
results show that the project would be economically robust.
Project Risks
6.14      Three usual areas of project risks are - institutional, technical
and security. Institutional risks should not pose a problem for the project
as the staff has proven its competence in implementing the first project.
WZhile the technology chosen demands a high degree of competence, particularly
in the production of clonal planting materials, experience gained in the
latter stages of the first project and the training that has been arranged
for staff in nursery management techniques in Thailand should ensure the
successful implementation of the program. Security was one of the factors
which were taken into account in selecting project estates. Security did not
pose a problem in the implementation of the first project and is not expected
to create a problem for the proposed project.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations GOB gave the following assurances:
(a)  In the event that the UNDP Project Document failed to become effec-
tivre by October 31, 1983 or by such later dates as the Association
may agree, GOB would establish to the satisfaction of the Associa-
tion that adequate funds for the project would be available from
other sources on terms and conditions consistent wilth its obliga-
tions under the Development Credit Agreement (para :3.20);
(b)  Prior to the appointment of the Chief Technical Advisor, RS would
furnish to the Association for comment (i) the proposed terms of
reference for the advisor and (ii) the qualificationis of proposed
candidates for the position (para 3.21);
(c)  RS would discuss with the Association annually, but not later than
JanIuary 1, 1984 and April 1 of each subsequent: year, its proposed
trainLing program for staff of RS (para 3.22);
(d)  Until the completion of the project RS would submit to the Associa-
tion for its review and comment (i) by December 31 of each year,
beginling December 31, 1984, a five-year research program for the
current and following four years, the first such plan to cover the



-29-
period April 1, 1984 to March 31, 1989; and (ii) by June 30, 1985,
an annual research report covering the period between April 1 and
March 31 of each year, and detailing RS's research activities to
date, its findings and its proposed future research activities
(para 3.24);
(e) RS head office would maintain separate accounts for its project
related activities and RS would collate estate accounts and con-
solidate these with accounts for all other RS activities to
produce, inter alia;
(i) a statement showing sources and uses of funds;
(ii) an income and expenditure statement; and
(iii) a balance sheet (para 3.37);
(f) RS accounts iwould be audited annually by an independent auditor and
in accordance with procedures satisfactory to IDA. (The audit
report would include, inter alia, a statement that funds disbursed
against statements of expenditure had been used for the purpose
for which they were provided (para 3.37);
(g) RS would send IDA copies of the summary of the unaudited project
accounts within six months of the end of each fiscal year, to be
followed by copies of the audited accounts and auditor's report
when completed but not more than nine months from the end of each
fiscal year (para 3.37) and;
(h)  Until the completion of the project, RS would submit to the
Association not later than April 1 of each year commencing 1984,
a five year development plan prepared on the basis of five year
development 1:lans submitted by each project estate in respect of
it:s activities for the current and following four years, outlining
RS's income and expenditure budget and planned physical activities
pertaining to rubber for the current and following four years (para
4.06).
7.02      With the above assurances and conditions the project would be
suitable for an IDA credit of US$ 9 million.
