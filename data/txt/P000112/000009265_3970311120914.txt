MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF BENIN
FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following mcmorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Benin for SDR 5.5 million (US$8.0 million equivalent), on standard
IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance an cnvironmental management project. The project
will help the Govermment implement the National Environmental Action Plan prepared with the support of
UNSO, France, Germany and IDA, and adopted by the Governmcnt in June 1993.
2.           Economic BackEround. Benin is a small country with a population of about 5 million, an
area of about 113,000 kin2 and an annual per capita income of US$410 in 1992. The primary sector
accounts for about 40 percent of GDP, over 70 percent of exports and employs 70 percent of the active
population. The secondary sector accounts for about 12 percetnt of GDP, essentially in the form of
manufacturing, cement production and limited offshore oil resources. The tertiary sector basically consists
of custom and transit services and of informal but vigorous tradirg activities. The population grows at a
rate of about 3.2 percent per year and is very unevenly distributed, with a density of 188 inhabitants per
km2 in the south (63 percent of the population concentrated on 12 percent of the area) and about 14
inhabitants per km 2 in the north. Urban population represents 30 percent of the total and grows at an
average rate of about 4 percent and 8 percent in Cotonou. Benin still possesses a generous enviromnent,
which, if protected and managed with care, should be able to satisfy the basic needs of its population and
be the basis for sustinable development. Nevertheless, increasing deterioration of Benin's enviromnent has
become a major cause of concern for the Government.
3.            The country's economy is dominated by agriculture, and although food security and cotton
exports could be achieved and expanded wnth a resulting agricultural growth rate above 4 percent
throughout the 80s until today, this has ofcn been accomplished through more extensive land use,
expanding the agricultural frontier to protected forest areas and rangeland. Although 65 percent of Benin's
total area is covered by some type of woody or bushy vegetation, the natural resources situation shows
evidence of advanced degradation. In rural areas the issue is essentially a matter of changing/eliminating
vegetation and reducing soil fertility. Water runoff intensifies on unprotected soils, erosion accelerates and
water source and well replenishment declines thus threatening the hydrological balance. Water supply in the
north is insufficient and there is a need to develop new water points for livestock and human needs. The
sanitary quality of water is poor and disposal of garbage and human waste represents another threat to
water quality. Population pressure on the coastl part of the country in the South has generated vezy
important envirorunental stress with potential threats of lagoon pollution, decline in fish production, and
silting due to watershed deforestation. Biodiversity is still relatively rich with about 1,3 million ha of
national parks and hunting areas, with potental for tourism development. Their protection agaist
poaching, catte grazing, bush fires and crop encroachment is increasingly difficult. Neglect of the ur'ban
environment has led over the years to a serious degradation of the living standards in most of Benin's towns
which are il-equipped to host an expandig population with subsequent unemployment and sanitation
problems. Industrial activities are stfill limnited and do not cause major environmental concerns.

4.           Sector Backiiround. Increasing awarcness of cnvironmental constraints, particularly
since he change of regunc and of economic policy in 1990, has led the Govcrmnmnt to requcst the support
of the international community to help preparc and implemcnt a National Environmcntal Action Plan
(NEAP). The preparation process, which stands as a modcl of participatory approach, was initiated in
1991 and the final report was adapted by the Govcrnment in Junc 1993. The NEAP is an integral part of
the national economic and social development policy. By its dynamic nature it will nced to bc adjusted and
monitored regularly and will constitutc the basis for the dcfinition of investment priorities and assistance
planning. It is based on the following main principles: a) participation of all main actors and segments of
the population (public, private, NGOs, Univcrsity); b) focus on communication, information and training;
c) long tern approach and continuity of the process; d) building on cxisting activities, cxpcriences and
resources; and e) donor coordination. The Govemment also decided to creatc in 1991 a new Ministry of
Environmnt, Housing and Urban planning (MEHU) to better address environrmental issues. Not only is its
mandate very ambitious, but it also lacks the resources to implement meaningful activities. Moreover, its
responsibilities combine both environmental and development issues. This has been a source of conflicts
and has raised questions of impartiality, since MEHU has to police its own actions and those of other
Ministries of equal status while its own implementing activities are not neutral to the environment.
Appropriately, the NEAP has recommended a review of the institutional framework with the objective to
improve overall inter-agency coordination and the national management capacity on environmental matters.
5.           Most of the current environmental legislation is oriented toward repressive control and
protection of forest, land and water within the public domain, but is too ambitious and cannot be enforced.
Environmental evaluation of on-going or new activities is almost non-existent and new projects are
accepted without adequate analysis of their environmental impact. T'he regulatory and policy framework is
presendy being reviewed and a number of new codes andl policies have been prepared under the NEAP or in
coordination with it, in the following main domains: forest, sanitation, biodiversity conservation,
environmental education, territorial administration and decentralization. An environmental code has also
been prepared as folow up of the NEAP and has been transmitted to Parliament for adoption. Among other
things it defines the general requirements for the implementation of an environmental assessment policy.
6.           The Government has also recently initiated with IDA and other donors' support a number
of projects which fall within the NEAP and already contribute to its implementation by tackling some of the
highlighted constiaints. Among these is the FY92 Natural Resources Management project (NRMP) which
aims at strengthening natural resources planning and proomotes sustainable producton systems and natural
resources management by organimzed rural communities on natural forests and watershed pilot sites. The
FY92 Urban Rehabilitation and Managenent project aims at improving the urban ifrastructure of
Cotonou and Porto Novo through labor intensive works and better planning and management of urban
growth. The FY94 Rural Water project aims at maximizing the impact and sustainability of water services
and supply in rural areas. The FY95 Population and Health Sector project (under preparation) would
support the adoption and implementation of a national population policy and develop better delivery of
community-based health services. The FY9( National Parks Conservation and Management project (under
preparation for possible GEF financing) wo -- assist in the protection of the national biodiversity heritage
in the reserves and surrounding buffer areas with the participation of local commuunities.
7.           Project Obiectives. The project would contribute to the implementation of the NEAP as
part of a multi-donor approach to finance projects and programs which have been generated by or are in
line with the NEAP's recommedations and priorities over a 15 year period. It would aim at utilizing and
building national capacity. It would pursue the uain objective of developing a national environmental



-3 -
management capacity to conceive, plan, and implement policies and programs, monitor and enforce
legislation, strengtn coordination mechanisms, develop an infonnation system and promote better
integration of environmental concerns in the fiameworlr of socio-economic dcvelopmcnt plans. It would
also help improvc the awareness, understanding and knowledge of environmental issues for the various
segments of the population, and foster integration of environmcntal considcrations in the education system.
S.           Proiect Description. Over a four year period the project would implcment the following
main activities:
A)  Institutional strengthening (48 percent of project costs) w&ould support the environmental
coordination, planning, enforcement and monitoring capacity of the Governmcnt. As
recommended by the NEAP, the responsibilities of MEHU, and particularly of the Directoratc of
Environment, have been reviewed so to emphasize policy preparation rather than implementation
and provide the basis for a more modest but meaningul agenda. A small National Environmental
Agency (NEA) has been created and would be supported under the Credit. The mandate of NEA
is of a technical nature only and it would bc the insument of the Govenunent and of the society
for assessing environmental impacts, nonitoring implementation of the regulatory framework,
infonning and proposing remedial actions to the political level. It would ensure regular updating
of the NEAP, monitoring its implementation, and planning of environmental initiatives.
Participation of the civil society in the decision-making process would also be promoted with
focus on support for decetralized environmental planning and action-oriented initiatives.
B)  Monitoring of the remulatorv fiamework and quality control (18 percent of project costs) would
include the i) definition of norms, standards, procedures and guidelines to support the underlying
legislation; ii) monitoring implementation of tie regulatory framework and of an environmental
impact assessment policy; iii) preparation of contingency plans, monitoring of quality standards
and prevention of environnental risks for a number of activities which require better
preparedness or surveillance; and iv) preparation of a number of environmental audits.
C)  Establishment of an effective environmental infonnation management and rnonitoring system (18
percent of projcct costs) that would develop a common architecture to exchange infonnation
between different structures collecting and retrieving information and meaningfully integrate data
collected by various sources with different standards and mnethods. The project would therefore
upgrade existing arrangements, strengthen the analytical capacity of the difflerent centers to
constitut and maintain relevant data bases and promote the estblishment of an information
exchange network. Environmental indicators would be defined and monitored. This comnponent
would also include preparation of a Coastal Zone Management master plan.
D)  implementation of an environmental education. information and communication pro rani (E1C)
(16 percent of project costs) including i) integration of environmental considerations in education
programs of the primary and secondary cycles and of the adult literacy programs, through the
preparation of teachers' manuals; ii) organization of special sensitization and awareness raising
initiatives in schools; iii) implementation of an important training effort on specific
environental issues for teachers' trainers, for a core team of civil servants in the most important
Ministries, and for special interest groups as parliamentarians, NGOs, and women organizations
through the organiation of specific workshops; and iv) a capacity building effort for the



-4 -
promotion of environmental outreach campaigns through a group of national journalists known
as "the environmcntal desk", constituted undcr the NEAP, and the media in general.
9.           Proiect Implementation. The general principles behind the implementation strategy of the
project would be to: a) promote a better understanding and tackling of environmental issues by the
integration of environmental concerns in the prepa.ation and implementation of sectoral policies through
existing structures; b) decentralize managcment and make maximum use of the private sector, NGOs and
local comnnunities in the actual execution of actions and studies, while maintaining strong coordination; c)
keep the pace of implementation in line with capacity building and institutional development; and d)
maintain great flexibility in the preparation of annual working plans and establish clear monitoring
indicators. NEA would be the inplementing agency for this project, including for procurement,
disbursement and accounting matters. Coordination mechanisms and working groups would be established
at the technical level with different other public and private agencies to help NEA eany out its activities
and implement its capacity building mandate. NEA would not conduct studies or environmental
assessments itself, nor would it build up data bases or implement specific actions. It would rather contract
these activities out and ensure that the correct screening, mandatory review and enforcement is carried out,
evaluate the results and submit its recommendations to the political level. NEA would establish a twinning
arrangemaent with a similar agency or NGO and would look for a partnership with an external firm for short
termn periodic technical and managerial support. A Steering Committee, to be chaired by the Minister of
MEHU and including representatives from other Ministries, NGOs and the enviromnental desk, would
provide general oversight and be the forum where progress reports and specific issues would be debated
and arbitrated. NEA's Director would provide the Secretariat of such Committee.
10.          Proiect Sustainability. The highly participatory nature of the NEAP preparation process
has enhanced the understanding and the scope of the environmental agenda and permitted to broaden
ownership within Benin. NEA, as a public body, would require some recurrent costs allocations from the
national budget as IDA support is progressively phased out. However, given its modest size and also the
possibility of other donors' support and donations, it would involve only a marginal increase. The
Environmental Code would provide NEA with the legal authority and stature to carry out its mandate as a
permanent national structure, hence also fostering institutional sustainability.
I.          Lessons learned from previous IDA involvement. Previous projects have often been
dictated by regional or sectoral development considerations with little attention to environmental concerns.
The proposed institutional organization for environmental management reflect the arrangements of NEAP
preparation process which proved to be very effective and successful. It also appears that activities of such
intersectoral nature would require strong donor coordination and maximum strategic and institutional
coherence with on-going activities. Moreover, lessons from most of the recent IDA initiatives in Benin point
to the need for local conmunuity and private sector participation in the preparation and implementation of
development actions and also the decentralization of the decision-making process; at the same time,
however, national coordination remnains necessary for overall sustainability and long term development
impact.
12.          Rationale for IDA involvement. At Government's request, IDA supported the preparation
of the NEAP and played the leading role in donor coordination. The NEAe document represents an
inportant step for integrating environmental considerations into the overall econonic and social
development strategy. IDA has been instrumental during the whole preparation process in helping the
Govermnent promote general public awareness on the environment, maitain a high level of policy dialogue



-5 -
and initiatc ncw sectoral prograns within that framcwork. Thc Govcrnumnt has bcen cxtrermcly rcsponsive
in causing cnvironmental ismucs to become national priori'ics. To maintain momentum and fulfill
expectations devcloped during thc preparation process, IDA involvemcnt in assisting translate action plans
into actual implementation of investment progmms is csscntial. The proposed project is fully consistent
with thc Country Assistance Stratcgy for Bcnin, prcsented to the Board in May 1994, which specifically
aims at drawing attcntion to thc impact on the cnvironmcnt and the protcction of natural resources. As an
area of Special Emphasis the stratcgy proposes to assist thc Govcrnment to implemcnt the
recommcndations of the NEAP and help develop a sound policy basc to foster integration of cnvironmental
considerations into scctoral strategies and programns. The proposed project is part of the IDA Icnding
program in both the Higb Case and Low Case Scenario of the Country Assistance Strategy.
13.          Issues and Actions. The Governmnent, IDA and the various donors, have held a post-
appraisal workshop for the creation of NEA, the definition of its statute and role. As a condition of Credit
negotiations the Government has taken a decree redefining the mandate of the Directorate of Environment,
has created NEA, and has appointed its Director. A draft Implementation Manual including:
implementation mechanisms and procedures, monitoring indicators, NEA's work schedule for its different
functions, terms of reference and contractual arrangements, was prepared and discussed during
negotiations. The Government has also approved the new environmental regulatory fiamework and
transmitted it to the Parliament for adoption. During negotiations, the Government and IDA have agreed
that competent staff acceptable to IDA would be recruited and maintained. Auditing and reporting
requirements were also agreed upon, including the implementation of a mid-tern review about two years
after Board approval. Conditions for effectiveness would be a) the appointment of project auditors
acceptable to IDA and the establishment of an accounting management and monitoring system; b) the
appointment of NEA's professional staff; c) the selection of consultants acceptable to IDA to provide short-
term technical and managerial assistance to NEA; d) adoption of an Implementation Manual acceptable to
the Bank; and e) the initial deposit of FCFA3O million as part of the Government contribution to project
financing.
14.          Environmental Aspects. The project would be the main vehicle to develop an
environmental capacity to monitor and tackle the most important environmental issues in the countsy. It
will permit the establishment of a national Enviromnental Assessnent capacity. It would also have a
beneficial environmental impact by contributing to a better awareness by the population of the necessity to
preserve and manage the environment as the basis for sustainable development. The eavironmentai category
of this project is C.
15.          Program Obiective Category. The project would permit implenentation of the priority
actions idzntified in the NEAP and directly relates to the country enviromnental stiategy. It would
contribute to the formulation and implementation of sound environmental managemrex. policies and help
preserve the natural resources base. By dovetailing with on-going activities it would reinforce the
environmental perspective of sectoral strategies and be in line with IDA's anti-poverty strategy for the
country.
16.          Proiect Benefits and Risks. The project would permit the de' elopment of an effective and
indispensable tool to build a national environmental management capacity required to implement and
monitor the priority actions identified by the NEAP. It would raise the levv,i of envirornmental awareness of
large segments of the population and foster participation of the civil socicty in the decision-making process.
Inplementation of this project would provide an opportmity to pur,ue economic development which is



-6-
consistent with and dcpcnds on protccting the environment and hcnce safcguarding pcople's wclfarc. The
major risks would stem from the difficulty to coordinatc intcrscctoral activitics and to agrec on an
institutional set-up which would minimize disscnsions and facilitate implementation. Howcver, the
proposed approach to strcngthen the intcrscctoral monitoring and coordination functions through a small
but effectivc environmcntal management agency, while streamlining and clarifying present environmcntal
responsibilities, and supporting existing structures and the private sector in thc implementation of sectoral
programs, should avoid institutional coniflicts and ease management. Moreover, although the impact on the
national budgct for the functioning of such agency would be minimal, political support and regular budget
allocations would be esscntial to sustain implementation of the environmentaI agenda. Another risk derives
from the shortage of qualified local personnel with background and experience on cnvironment. To mitigate
this risk an important education effort would be undertaken.
17.          Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
