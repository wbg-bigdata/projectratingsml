*          Beneficiaries:  Small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) in manufacturing,
mining and related ser-ice industries with total assets of
less than US$1.0 million equivalent.
Amount:         US$80 million equivalent.
Terms:          Seventeen  years,  including  5 years  of  grace,  at  the
standard variable interest rate.
Relending       BR would relend the proceeds of the loan to participating
Terms:          financial  intermediaries  (PFIs),   pegged  to  the  fully
variable average deposit rate of the Colombian banking
system (DTF). BR would relend in local currency and would
bear the foreign exchange risk since the free market DTF
rate has reflected over the long run expectations of
currency adjustment and  thus  contains an implicit foreign
exchange risk premium.   Relending  rates  to SMEs would be
determined by each PFI according to the maturity, credit
risk, operational cost and competition for each loan.
Guidelines would establish  an  allowable  maximutm of DTF+4
percentage points in 1989 and DTF+5 percentage points in
1990 for SME loans carrying the minimum 4 year maturity.
Haximum interest rates  to  SMEs  and  the  margins of PFIs
would be progressively increased for loans with longer
maturities, up to an additional one percentage point for
maturities up to 10 years.

MEOWRNDUM AND RECOCIEKNDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE CENTRAL BANK OF COLOMBIA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF TEE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR A FIFTH SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISE PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and  recommendation  on a proposed US$80.0
million loan to the Central Bank of Colombia with the guarantee of the
Republic of Colombia is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be
repayable over a period of 17 years, including 5 years of grace, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would help finance a Fifth
Small and Medium Scale Enterprise Project.
2.      Background.  The Colombian Government  has assigned a high priority
to employment creation and income growth among lower income segments of the
population, particularly in view of persistent high unemployment rates and
socio-political unrest. While the economy sustained overall growth rates
of about 5 1 p.a. during 1986-87, the Government is aware that many small
and medium scale enterprises (SHEs) do not share in such trends by virtue
of a lack of access to institutional credit and technical support systems,
and of policies which appear to favor large scale enterprises.
3.      Credit to SMEs has  declined  substantially  in  the  1980s and is
heavily concentrated in the Corporacion Financiera Popular (CFP), a public
development bank. In this situation, the Goverment's strategy is to expand
the level of SME lending by relying more on private CFs and commercial
banks, and by introducing more specific support for microenterprises. It
also aims to increase emphasis on raising efficiency and incomes of SMEs,
which should help generate increased employment over the medium-term.  This
would be done inter alia by increasing the provision of technical advisory
services to SMEs to resolve enterprise-specific production, management and
product marketing problems. While the CFP has developed a strong capacity
to reach and support small scale enterprises, little progress has been made
in   developing   it   as   an   autonomous,   financially  self-sustaining
institutional mechanism serving SMEs.   Thus,  the Government is seeking to
*         remedy this largely by promoting a more competitive SME lending environment
in which CFP must operate.
4.      Rationale for Bank Involvement.   The Bank's country strategy calls
primarily for support to help Colombia to maintain fiscal and monetary
discipline, increase export diversification and maintain creditworthiness,
and reduce poverty and unemployment. The Bank has supported the generation
of employment inter alia under four SME loans, totalling US$92.5 million,
through CFP over the past thirteen  years.   The Bank loan of US$40 million
(Ln. 2446-CO) under the Fourth Project (SME4) was fully committed in
September 1987 and 95Z disbursed in October 1988. The experience gained in
these projects has inspired more attention under the proposed Project to
changes in policy and institutional factors, which are equally important
constraints to SME development as the lack of available credit.



- 2 -
5.      Proiect Obiectives.  The objective of the proposed Project would be
to increase SME value added and employment creation. This would be done
mainly bys   (a)    making  changes  in  public  policies and institutional
mechanisms influencing SME access to long-term credit, simultaneously
supporting on-going financial sector adjustments by helping to reduce
diatortions in resource allocation, adjust the pricing of credit to reflect
its cost and associated risk, and upgrade portfolio quality; (b) expanding
the number of financial intermediaries making SME loans and the volume of
their ovn resources mobilized for this purpose; (c) simplifying loan
processing and increasing technical cooperation to SMEs; and td) preparing
studies and recommendations during Project implementation on policies
influencing capital intensity, business establishment and operations as a
basis for a dialogue with the Government on promoting a neutral policy
environment for SME development.
6.      Proiect  Description.    The  Project  would  be  composed  of  two
components, one for provision of SHE credit (US$234.9 million) and the
other for technical cooperation (TC) (US$0.2 million). The credit program
would be administered by the Central Bank of Colombia (BR) as the second-
tier institution. BR would provide a maximum of autonomy, consistent with
prudent supervision of the loan, to first-tier participating financial
intermediaries (PFIs). All development banks (CFs) and commercial banks in
Colombia could, in principle, become PF1s.   To qualify, they would have to
meet a set  of  eligibility  criteria  under which:   (a) all institutions
observe the financial and operating requirements of the Superintendency of
Banks, which are satisfactory to the Bank for the purposes of the Project;
(b) CFs meet the standards of the CF Reform Act of 1987, which embrace the
same standards as past B-lnk-financed DFC projects; and (c) CFP meets
additional capital, profitability and operating efficiency targets. An
initial group of twelve such institutions (including CFP), with nearly
1,300 branch offices, have agreed in principal to implement the credit
program. CFP and the Caja Social de Ahorros, another specialized private
lender, would act as Managing Institutions to supervise lending to
microenterprises through NGOs.
7.      The credit  program would  support  SMEs  and microenterprises in
manufacturing,  mining  and  associated  service  sector  businesses.   The
program would finance SME loans or equity investments for the purchase of
machinery and equipment, spare parts, the construction of industrial
building facilities, and permanent working capital needed to increase SME
productivity and expand production  capacity.    It would also finance, for
well-defined restructuring plans designed to increase the productivity of
existing SMEs, a wider range of eligible expenditures, such as for research
and development, marketing,  labor  retraining  and  relocation.   It would
further finance TC to help resolve enterprise-specific problems, including
environmental hazards being created by SM.s.
8.      The total cost  of  the  project  is  estimated at US$235.1 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$80.0 million (34Z). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. The



- 3 -
amounts  and  methods  of   procurement   and  of  disbursements,  and  the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Colombia are
given in Schedules C and D,  respectively.    A map and the Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 7493-CO dated February 9, 1989, are also attached.
9.      Agreed Actions.   BR  would  relend  the  proceeds  of the loan and
charge an interest rate equivalent to from DTF-1 to DTF+1 percentage points
(DTF  is   the   fully   variable   90-day   deposit   rate  for  financial
intermediaries), depending upon the category of financial intermediary,
comitment year and maturity of the SME loan. Maturities of funds relent to
PFIs would match those set  for  SHE  clients.  The individual SME loan and
cumulative financing limits for any one SME would be US$0.5 million.
Guidelines establish an allowable maximum interest rate of from DTF+4 to
DTF+6 percentage points to SHE cliceCs, again depending upon the above-
mentioned factors. Such rates would be 4-6 percentage points above the
effective interest rates of the SME 4 Project. Maturities of between 4-10
years with 1-3 years of grace would be established for financing of fixed
assets, restructuring plans and technical cooperation; permanent working
capital would be financed for up to 5 years with 1 year of grace. The
Bank's free limit for ex ante approvals by BR of SME loans would be set at
US$400,000, covering an estimated 25? of the Bank's loan amount. The ex
ante free limit set by BR would vary according to the experience of the
PFI. To maintain supervision quality, a provision would also be made for
automatic suspension by BR of a PFI's access to the Project's rediscount
facility if performance during a quarter, in terms of recovery of principal
and interest due from SME loans, fell below 902.
10.     The  following  other  measures   were   also  agreed  upon  during
negotiations: (a) with BR, changes in SME financial policies - (i) an
increase in the total asset ceiling for eligible SMEs to US$1.0 million;
(ii) elimination of SME interest rate subsidies by 1990 and introduction of
flexible pricing by PFIs; (iii) revision of regulations of the Government's
directed credit line for SMEs (the FFI) so as to substantially align them
with those of the Bank loan; and (iv) provision for a broader definition of
eligible expenditures under the credit program for enterprises preparing
well-defined restructuring plans; (b) with CFP, (i) attainment of targets
of 6.0? of administrative cost as a share of average total assets in 1989
and 5.5? in 1990, and targets of 1.0? of net after-tax profits to total
average assets in 1989 and 1.6? in 1990, and (ii) Bank financing limited to
35? of total annual CFP commitments over 1989-90; (c) with all PFIs, draft
Participation Agreements with BR specifying inter alia relending terms,
appraisal guidelines, documentation requirements, and the need to maintain
a sound financial condition and SME lending operations; and (d) with the
Government, assurances that capital contributions to CFP are adequate to
keep its debt/equity ratio at not more than 7.5:1 at December 31, 1989 and
1990. As special conditions of loan effectiveness, the Government would
put into effect the SME financial policy changes, and BR would conclude
and duly execute Participation Agreements with at least three PFIs making
indicative commitments for SME lending aggregating at least 40? of the loan
amount and with one Managing Institution for the microenterprise program.
11.     Benefits.  The proposed  Project  would help Colombia to accelerate
value added, employment creation and the supply of goods and services of
SMEs.   Previous  Bank-financed  projects  have  clearly demonstrated their



- 4 -
ability to  have  a  substantial  impact  in  these  areas.    Under  SME 3
(1834-CO), for example, an ex-post evaluation based on a survey 127
borrowers revealed average incremental growth in sales of 26.5? per year,
in employment of 13.31 per year, and in labor productivity of 10.4S per
year. The Project would also substantially expand access to scarce long-
term investment resources to increase productivity, expand installed
capacity, and help to revive existing non-performing loans in the banking
system. It would make modes,, adjustments in financial policies influencing
SMEs' credit access and help private development and commercial banks to
expand their relationships with the SME market.
12.     Risks.  The main  implementation  risk  associated with the Project
lies in the ability of participating commercial banks to adapt their
appraisal, supervision and administrative processes to the requirements of
SMEs. To mitigate this risk, they, along with other PFIs, would make clear
organizational, staff and financial resource commitments to the Project in
their Participating Agreements and participate in staff training courses
under the aegis of Colombia's Bankers' Association in order to ensure that
their systems are well prepared for SME lending.
14.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Loan.
