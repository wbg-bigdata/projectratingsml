1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

Country and Sector Background: Food and drugs oversight is an essential public health function.
Monitoring of foods and drugs for safety and effectiveness including licensing new drugs is the
responsibility of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW). Food and drugs oversight is on
the concurrent list of the Indian Constitution with responsibility shared between the Central government
and the States.

The major generic health sector issues in India at the time of project preparation were: wide disparities in
health status among regions and between poor and non-poor households; inadequate institutional
arrangements and weak program management; low quality of services in both the public and private
sectors; ineffective targeting of public funds to the poor; inadequate framework for engaging the private
sector; low efficiency and limited financial resources; and poor governance. These problems existed
within a general institutional environment of poor oversight and inadequate measurement of health
system performance.

Issues in Food Safety: There was an increasing concern in the country about unsafe foods and their effect
on the health of the population. World Health Organization (WHO) estimates had indicated that in low-
income countries, about three-fourths of all episodes of diarrhea were caused by unsafe water and poor
sanitation, with the remaining one-fourth mostly attributable to food borne infections. While there were
regulations for ensuring food safety, enforcement was weak and methods outdated. Specific issues
included:

(a) Insufficient public awareness about food safety. A vast majority of the Indian population was
depending upon the small, unorganized and street food vendors. Food handlers in this informal sector
generally lacked awareness of safety and quality control issues. The problem was aggravated by the fact
that many households also lacked the knowledge for safe handling of foodstuffs.

(b) Weak enforcement of existing regulations. Traditionally, the system had depended on spot-checks of
manufacturing conditions and random sampling of final products. Even this system was not evenly
enforced at all levels. States had shown varying degrees of cooperation, commitment and participation in
enforcing the Prevention of Food Adulteration (PFA) Act. Incidence of food adulteration was higher in
the States where the PFA administration was generally weaker.

(c) Inadequate capacity of food testing laboratories: The four Central and 79 State laboratories, including
13 food laboratories managed by local bodies, did not have sufficient capacity to perform analysis to
respond to existing needs or to meet future growth.

(d) Alignment with International Standards: There was a need for technical assistance in order to develop
the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) programs in the domestic food industry.

Issues in Drugs Quality and Safety. As with food, public interest in ensuring that drugs sold in the
country were of good quality was starting to take hold. The Indian pharmaceutical market, with annual
sales of US$7.2 billion (1999), is ranked third in the world. While the Indian government had succeeded
in realizing its policy objectives of ensuring the availability of reasonably priced drugs and promoting the
growth of a vibrant domestic industry, the objective of ensuring uniform good quality needed to be



                                                       1

effectively addressed. 75 percent of the industry's production was accounted for by 150 large
manufacturers out of a total of about 9,000 firms. These large manufacturers generally produced quality
products as per WHO Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). On the other hand, the smaller production
units were often not producing up to the required standards. However, the state policies to encourage the
growth of small scale industry and poorly regulated rural markets encouraged such units to thrive.

The specific issues regarding drugs quality were:

(a) Insufficient consumer awareness. There was a general absence of consumer awareness regarding
issues of drug quality and of misuse of drugs.

(b) Weak enforcement of existing regulations. The system for ensuring drug quality was inadequate. There
was a high level of heterogeneity in institutional and implementation arrangements. Similarly,
enforcement of GMP was highly variable. The quality of training for Drug Inspectors was uneven. There
was anecdotal evidence of lack of transparency in granting of licenses in manufacturing and retailing.

(c) Inadequate capacity of drug testing laboratories: States' drug testing facilities differed in capacity. Of
the 19 drug testing laboratories functioning in 35 States/Union Territories, only seven had the ability to
perform a full range of tests. In both public and private drug testing laboratories, skills of analysts needed
to be updated.

(d) Alignment with International Standards: The Indian Pharmacopeia, the official book of standards for
drugs and their formulations, was outdated and did not reflect many newly developed drugs.

Rationale for Bank assistance: The project supported the health goals articulated in the Country
Assistance Strategy1 (CAS), in particular the objective of developing the capacity to manage public health
programs effectively, such as surveillance and food and drug control. It also drew on lessons learned from
the large ongoing health portfolio and analytical work by building into project design the following areas
of emphasis in the CAS: (a) building state capacity to manage health systems more effectively, and (b)
supporting strategies for public private partnerships which focus more than before on the relative
strengths of various sectors. The project was consistent with the Bank's analytical work on the health
sector, which had highlighted "government oversight" as a critical function of the health system.

The project was a vehicle to support the long run vision of government in an important aspect of social
welfare. Among the development assistance agencies, the Bank was best positioned to assist in major
long-term policy reforms such as this one. The Bank also had the ability to tap international experience
and coordinate with other donors with an interest in food and drugs quality and safety. It had an ongoing
partnership with WHO and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and would further strengthen its
collaboration with these agencies under the project.




1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)



1Document number: 22541-IN (CAS); Date of latest CAS discussion: June 27, 2001.




                                                      2

The main objective of the project was to improve the quality and safety of foods and drugs in India by
strengthening the regulatory framework and incorporating components of consumer education and public-
private partnerships.

Key Indicators were:
    · The Government develops recommendations and options for appropriate policies and measures
        for improving food and drugs quality and safety, in line with its new approach.
    · Increased consumer awareness and knowledge (to be measured through household surveys).
    · Increased capacity, quality and timeliness of food and drug testing (to be measured through audits
        by independent experts.
    · HACCP standards and procedures are developed and introduced in selected priority food sectors.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The objective was not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD and as
captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit from
the project)

    · Society at large. Increased safety and quality of foods and drugs would result in lower morbidity
        and premature mortality. The poor would especially benefit because they were more likely to be
        victims of poor quality foods.

    · Private sector, medium and small scale manufacturers would benefit from the opportunities for
        training and assistance in improving manufacturing processes and product quality.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
The project consisted of three components as follows:

Component 1: Policy Development, Program Coordination and Monitoring (US$7.0 million)

This component would consist of policy development; strengthening of the central government food and
drug directorates; and improved program coordination and monitoring. Specific activities would include:

Policy Development:

    · Policy studies and reviews to underpin the formulation of policy and institutional reforms
    · Workshops and consultations with various groups of stakeholders

Program Coordination:

    · The establishment and operation of a central Program Coordination Unit (PCU)




Central Facilities and Staffing:


                                                   3

    · Improvement of central physical facilities for food and drugs oversight, and related staffing.

Monitoring:

    · Monitoring activities, including the implementation of household surveys to assess public
        perceptions and knowledge about quality and safety of foods and drugs, and the organization of
        independent audits of public and private laboratories.
    · The establishment and operation of a computerized management information system to enhance
        information flows and coordination between the central and State regulatory agencies

The component would finance consultants for studies and technical assistance, workshops, goods
including computers and software, civil works, and incremental operating costs.

Component 2: Food Safety (US$44.3 million)

This component would consist of activities to strengthen the government's oversight and regulatory
capacity for food safety at the central and State levels, to educate consumers on matters related to food
safety, and to upgrade related skills in the private sector. Specific activities would include:

    · A new program for building consumer awareness and knowledge of food safety issues;
    · Training of about 2,000 food inspectors and 500 analysts in public sector laboratories; and,
        recruitment of additional qualified staff;
    · Training of about 1,000 staff from the private sector;
    · Training in advocacy and other skills for 20 umbrella consumer organizations throughout the
        country;
    · Development and dissemination of HACCP standards;
    · New construction and equipping of six central and nine State laboratories;
    · Renovation and equipping of nine existing laboratories and public health offices at central and
        five laboratories at State levels.

This component would finance civil works, equipment, furniture, laboratory supplies, training, technical
assistance, consultants, contracting of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and media agencies, and
incremental operating and maintenance costs.

Component 3: Drugs Quality and Safety (US$21.6 million)

This component would consist of activities to strengthen the government's oversight and regulatory
capacity for ensuring drugs quality at the central and State levels, to educate consumers on matters related
to drugs quality and safety, and to upgrade related skills in the private sector. Specific activities would
include:

    · Information and education activities to improve consumer and prescriber awareness and behavior
        regarding quality and rational use of drugs, carried out with the support of professional media
        agencies and NGOs
    · Training of about 625 regulatory staff and recruitment of additional qualified staff
    · Training of about 2,000 industry personnel in GMP and Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)
    · Updating and dissemination of Indian Pharmaceutical (IP) standards
    · New construction and equipping of one central and five State drug testing laboratories;




                                                       4

    · Renovation and equipping of one existing drug testing laboratory at central and twelve
        laboratories at State levels

1.6 Revised Components

The components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

There were no changes in the project's design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements, and in the
project's schedule. However, there was a change in funding allocation as mentioned below:

Funding allocations. In March 2007, an amount of SDR 3.20 million was reallocated from Category 4
(Incremental Operating Costs) to Category 3 (b) (Other services including surveys, Information,
Education and Communications (IEC) and Management Information System (MIS) Services).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their mitigations
identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

During preparation, the project design took into account lessons learned from previous Bank-assisted
projects in the health sector in India and other countries. Likewise, the design considered the risk factors
and appropriate measures were adopted to mitigate all major risks identified at appraisal. The project also
provided a participatory framework involving stakeholders and direct beneficiaries in the decision-
making processes.

Lessons Learned from previous Bank-assisted projects.

Lessons from international experience

    · An effective national commitment to food and drugs quality and safety requires shared
        responsibility by government, consumers, industry, consumer organizations, and NGOs.

    · Alignment with international standards for food and drugs improves quality and safety of foods
        and drugs.

Lessons from India Health Projects

    · It is critical to focus on institutional arrangements, including clarity in Center-State
        responsibilities. Collaboration with community-based organizations and consumer groups is
        important for project success.

    · Public health education strategy development and implementation benefit from support by
        professional media agencies.

    · Early preparedness and up-front actions facilitate timely implementation and disbursement.

Risks and Risk Mitigation Measures. The table below shows the risks and mitigation measures identified
in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) along with brief commentary on how the risks evolved during
implementation.

Adequacy of participatory processes.

     · Many key consumer groups and industry associations were involved with the government on
         working committees related to food and drug regulation. NGOs involved in other health
         programs were contacted to participate in a planned series of consultations with States and
         expert institutions.

     · The home science college network had organized a set of consultations with its members, NGOs
         and community groups interested in nutrition. Similarly VOICE, an umbrella group for consumer
         agencies, and the Delhi Society for Promotion of Rational Use of Drugs (DSPRUD) were
         involved in the program.



2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions taken,
as applicable)
The project was not restructured, and no changes were made to the design. The project was at `Risk'
status until 2006, because of delayed implementation for the reasons mentioned below, and the resulting
low disbursement. The Bank conducted a Midterm Review (MTR) in February 2006, and assessed
progress to date on all project components, the implementation issues and the actions to be taken to
ensure the successful completion of the project.

The following factors affected project implementation:

Factors outside government control or implementation agency

The project was a broad new area for both the Bank and the GOI, and to implement a national program
of this magnitude in so many states resulted in implementation delays.

Factors subject to government control or implementation agency

(i) Centre and State Roles in Food and Drug regulation. The food and drugs sector being in the
Concurrent List of the Indian Constitution, both the Center and the States have independent authority to
pass legislations. This division of responsibilities between the Center and the States in legislation and
implementation of food and drug regulation in a large country like India with varied state capacities and
commitment was a major challenge throughout the project.

(ii) Lack of state ownership. The Concurrent nature of the food and drugs sector was one factor which led
to a lack of interest and commitment in some states to a project mandated by the centre. States were
particularly slow in addressing human resource issues which were at the heart of achieving effective
oversight and regulation in the food and drug sectors.

Besides, as there were too many states to share $54 million, the amount received per state was too little
for the states to evoke too much interest or ownership of the project, especially for the decision makers
and as a result, they did not give high priority for the project implementation.

(iii) Project Coordination issues. Institutional arrangements put in place under the project, (especially the
PCU), could not effectively meet this challenge, resulting in delayed initiation of activities and poor
communication between the Center and the States. Since the beginning and for the most part, routine
project management had been left to the PCU, which entirely consisted of consultants. There was no



                                                       8

project director or coordinator exclusively working on the project. To be effective, the PCU required clear
guidance and strong support from MOHFW, which was mostly missing during implementation. Being
outsiders, consultants were not familiar with the rules and procedures of the Ministry, and did not have
sufficient access to Ministry officials to expedite project matters. Besides, civil servants at the Center and
States did not pay much attention to PCU consultants. Further, the involvement of the technical wings ­
food and drugs ­ was minimal while their contribution was the key to any results that the project could
achieve. This lack of full involvement of the central food and drugs unit's staff was also a major
impediment to project implementation.

(iv) Inadequate staffing. The most critical input required for making both the Central and State
laboratories functional was staffing. Despite several efforts, the posts sanctioned under the project
(particularly those of microbiologists) could not be filled by most States as well as by the Center. This got
further compounded as many sanctioned posts of inspectors, and lab analysts, could not be filled up
because of the Supreme Court decision not to use contractual staff for statutory functions; and consequent
protracted delay in recruitment. Thus shortage of non-availability of adequate technical staff had
adversely affected critical staff affected lab testing, food and drugs inspection, and regular reporting, as
well as project implementation.

Further, because of the high turnover of staff both at the Center and the States, the project lacked
institutional memory, and continuity. For example, during five years of implementation, the Joint
Secretary in charge of the project in MOHFW changed four times, and the Director reporting to the Joint
Secretary on the project, also changed four times during the same period.

(v) Funds flow. In view of the low level of expenditure at the State level (15%), the project decided to use
the existing State AIDS Control Societies (SACS), for funds flow purposes rather than creating separate
mechanism. But due to weak linkages at the State level, expected level of operational efficiency could
not be achieved in making the resources available and reporting expenditure in time.

(vi) Procurement: Lack of clarity on the role of procurement support agency (PSA) - Ms. Hospital
Services Consultancy Corporation (HSCC) - and the implementing entity the MOHFW not only delayed
the procurement progress but also created the impression of fraud and corruption due to frequent
overruling of recommendations of HSCC which as a PSA was to expected to handle the procurement on a
non-turn key basis. MOHFW also took months (years in some cases) in clearing the bid evaluation
reports for equipment purchases. Poor planning and coordination with states also contributed to the
problems. The complexity of the equipment being procured also added to the delays. Frequent changes in
MOHFW staffing also contributed to delays and lack of ownership of the project.

(vii) Civil works and equipment: The following is a list of implementation deficiencies that were recorded
during the final supervision mission and could only partially be addressed during the last months of the
project duration:

    · In some cases, the sites were not ready by the time contract was awarded, mainly due to poor
         planning.
    · In some cases, although civil works were completed, buildings could not be used because water
         supply/electricity connections had not been provided as there was confusion on who should
         finance start-up costs for providing these utilities: many states have established independent
         corporations for such services. Such delays in taking over by users resulted in non release of
         retention money to the contractors, and contractors had to arrange for watch and ward till the time
         the completed work was taken over by the users.




                                                        9

    · In the case of equipment, there were instances of protracted delay in installation either due to the
         site not being ready or some important part missing, which resulted in expiry of the performance
         guarantee by the contractors.
    · Due to project delays, procurement of some equipment planned under the project was cancelled,
         resulting in incomplete upgrades of labs compared to original plans.
    · Some of the equipment supplied has not been installed or was received in a damaged condition
         and has not been used.
    · Some of the installed equipment is not being used because the available staff does not have the
         required technical skills yet.
    · Due to communication gaps between laboratories, procurement agencies and the suppliers, and no
         post-dispatch inspection, some of the equipment supplied is not as per specifications.
    · Delays in the installation of equipment was caused by deficiencies in the installation sites, lack of
         space, lack of staff, or infrastructure issues (water, electricity).
    · Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC) templates were not provided to the States. As per purchase
         contract, HSCC had been authorized by the Ministry to sign the purchase deal, which included
         the proposals for the AMC. Even though HSCC claims that it informed the State Governments
         and Laboratories that they need to buy the AMCs on their own, this communication appears to
         have been lost on the way to the State counterparts.
    · Some suppliers are non-responsive and appear unwilling to correct deficiencies in the delivered
         lab equipment. The terms of payment in the contracts (most of the payment is linked to delivery
         of equipment rather than the installation/commissioning) also contributed to this.
    · Deficiencies in consumable supplies (chemicals, reference standards) limit capacity in some cases.
         States need to budget for consumables in order to sustain lab outputs.

(viii) Creation of separate food and drug authorities. Another reason for the declining interest for the
government may have been the decision to create separate food and drug administrations outside the
MOHFW, absorbing capacity on the client side and potentially creating new communication barriers
between the entities involved.

(ix) Low disbursement. Main reasons for low disbursement during implementation period were: (a) the
generic problem of prolonged internal processing required by the MOHFW to finalize the bids; (b) lack of
a full-time Project Coordinator - a necessity not envisaged at the time of project preparation - resulting in
inadequate follow-up on project implementation; and (c) significant overestimation of costs of equipment
and civil works at appraisal.

At project closing, US$24.85 million of the total Credit was disbursed and US$36.35 million was
undisbursed. The main reasons for under-utilization of the credit were failure or delays in recruiting staff
as planned and delays in civil works and equipment procurement in combination with the government
decision to not extend the project. Further, due to exchange rate fluctuations, the total Credit available had
gone up to US$61.2 million from US$54 million equivalent at the time of project approval.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design: Several indicators were developed to monitor the performance of the project. Some of the
key indicators are mentioned in Section 1.2. MOHFW had adequate methods for collecting these data.
The monitoring and evaluation component of the project also included: (i) establishment of a
computerized MIS and (ii) a baseline survey to assess public perception and knowledge about quality and
safety of food and drugs.




                                                        10

M&E implementation: The project undertook two large scale surveys: (i) a national household survey
covering 20,250 households across the country on household behaviors relating to food and drug safety
and quality; and (ii) a street food survey on the safety and quality of street foods which led to about 20
action research activities in 18 cities through partnership with 18 home science colleges throughout the
country.

However, as no follow-up survey was done after the intervention, there was no way to establish
quantitative project impact.

M&E utilization: The data collected were not regularly or consistently used for any decision making.
However, the findings of the surveys were used for finalizing the consumer education plan. A
professionally developed and managed media campaign was also implemented throughout the country to
improve the population's behaviors relating to the purchase and consumption of food and drugs.



2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Safeguard issues. There were no major safeguard issues related to the implementation of the project.

Fiduciary issues. The project was the only on-going project among the five projects selected by the Bank
in 2007 for a Detailed Implementation Review (DIR).

The DIR's review of the project found:

        · indicators of potentially corrupt and fraudulent practices in the procurement and
            implementation of equipment and civil works, such as inconsistent treatment of bidders,
            submission of fraudulent documentation, and inappropriate rejection of bidders.
        · widespread deficiencies in the implementation of equipment and civil works, such as
            payment for incomplete civil works and uninstalled equipment.
        · weaknesses in the Bank's identification and handling of these indicators and deficiencies.


The DIR examined the project laboratory and office equipment contracts procured by the Procurement
Support Agent (PSA) through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and National Competitive
Bidding (NCB) procedures. The DIR found questionable procurement practices, some of which raising
a suspicion of potential fraud and corruption. Out of the 38 equipment contracts reviewed by the DIR,
29 contracts (76%) contained indicators suggesting that bidders were favored through problematic
procurement process However, the DIR noted that none of its findings suggested the existence of
cartels or collusive behavior between bidders.

The DIR found inconsistencies in the administration of the procurement process in the selection of
suppliers, such as in determining whether a specific item met specifications, or in choosing to seek
clarifications from some substantially responsive bidders and not others. The DIR also found indicators
related to government interference with the procurement process, such as unreasonable delays in the
award of contracts, shifting bidding deadlines and requirements, and narrowly drafted tenders.
Procurement officials appeared to have employed favoritism when awarding contracts to bidders that
failed to meet performance criteria while disqualifying other bidders that apparently met, or could have
met, the criteria. In addition, the DIR found potentially fraudulent documents submitted by winning




                                                      11

bidders, such as forged performance certificates, that, in some cases, were corroborated by complaints by
other bidders.

    · The MOHFW did a comprehensive review of the DIR report and the responses to the specific
        issues and proposed actions were submitted to the Bank. The following actions with timeline
        were envisaged by the Ministry:

    · Completion of joint inspection of the sites, both civil and equipment sites by 30th April,
        2008.
    · Corrective steps like meeting the deficiencies and correction of defects by 31st May, 2008.
    · Penal action against contractors/suppliers by 30th        April, 2008. Action against erring
        officials/agencies, if any at the earliest.
    · Concerted efforts to complete the works in pipeline to ensure their completion by 31st May, 2008.

Remedial actions initiated by the Bank on DIR observations on procurement for this project included:

    · Bank is currently assessing the need to declare mis-procurement of 10 contracts totaling about
        US$53,600, issued during the year 2005-06 because of violations of the agreed procurement
        procedure for the project.

    · The Bank has decided to not finance the state level procurement as of April 1, 2006 through the
        closure of the project as MOHFW did not share the list of contracts issued at state level despite
        reminders and it was not possible for the Bank to conduct the post review of these contracts.

    · For the contracts issued by HSCC (which were not prior reviewed by the Bank) during April 1,
        2006 until the end of the project, the post review has been completed and the report has been
        shared with MOHFW. Some procedural violations have been observed in this report also, which
        are being reviewed and appropriate remedial actions will be initiated, if needed.

    · DIR had also noted some indicators of fraud and corruption in prior review contracts for civil
        works and equipment. INT is proposed to be requested to share the evidence collected by them
        regarding these contracts so that a final view will be taken on whether these cases also require
        any remedial action.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by present
operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional capacity, and
next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

(a) Transition arrangements. In terms of technical initiative and reforms, the government has created an
independent Food Authority to ensure food safety and quality. Likewise, for the creation of Drug
Authority, the Bill is pending with the Indian Parliament, and this Authority is expected to become
functional soon after the Bill is passed. The central government has also ensured adequate budget
provisions. Training for both the government and private sector staff has been successfully given on food
and drugs. Policy and institutional development arrangements are also well in place. The positions
required in the Central lab were created and partially filled with contract staff. Most of the positions for
State labs are also sanctioned and many have been filled up or are in the process of recruitment. However,
in places where there are not enough personnel to carry out the increased level of activities, sustainability
of the achievements is likely to be jeopardized.

(b) Performance indicators. The same set of monitoring and evaluation indicators that were developed
under the project are likely to be used after the Food Authority and Drug Authority become fully
functional. (See Results Framework Analysis for the indicators)

(c) Follow-up Project. With regard to further Bank engagement in the sector, initial discussions with the
Ministry officials show an interest in small scale TA projects that can be realized quickly, but not in
another centrally managed lending program. For example, the government is interested in availing the
technical support and expert advice from the Bank, especially to promote transparency and governance in
the health/pharmaceutical sector in general, and in licensing new products in particular. There are also
ideas to include specific capacity building elements into State health programs or set up new programs
with some States that are willing to take ownership and initiative needed to ensure success. Focus might
be on the drug sector due to the global implications, as India is the largest exporter of generic drugs.

One potential way to avoid the governance and management pitfalls in future projects while maintaining
the principle that the client is responsible for implementation would be to develop a "results-based
financing" type of collaboration. The food and drug sector offers a number of clear and measurable
parameters that can be used as triggers for buy-downs or financial awards. The Bank interaction could be
directly with implementing agencies and facilities rather than going through central bureaucracy. Project
facilitation and management support could be provided by private sector consulting firms with a track
record of reliable achievement.

One example for such a project would be to set up a fund that pays one time award payments to drug
control labs on achieving a defined certification level. The mechanism would be voluntary and open to
labs from the center and all states, and target performance levels could be adjusted to create a repeat
opportunity for awarded labs if they achieve the next higher standard. One could imagine a multi-year
program with shifting focus, based on success and participation, addressing a bundle of parameters that
are relevant for achieving public health outcomes.

(d) Suggested priority and optimum timing of any future impact evaluation. The Food Authority may
want to consider conducting a repeat household survey to assess the behavioral changes by June 2009.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The project objectives are still highly relevant and important to India's health sector development. The
project is also consistent with the Bank's assistance strategy for India.

With rapidly changing food habits, and increasing consumption of food outside the house, there is a need
to have improved behavior in households as well as among food vendors and an institutional framework
to promote food quality.

In terms of pharmaceuticals, ensuring access to quality drugs at affordable prices is very important for
achieving health outcomes. Improving quality and regulation of Indian pharmaceutical industry can be
seen as a global public good with positive impact not only in India but worldwide as India has become the
leading exporter of generic drugs.




                                                      13

The project design was consistent with the objectives ­ food and drug regulation in India is a
responsibility shared between Center and States and therefore it is a valid assumption that a project that
aims to build capacity in these areas needs to target both Center and States.

However, during implementation it turned out that the design was too ambitious in assuming that the
complexity of multiple Center-State interactions can be managed centrally. With the benefit of hindsight,
one might have chosen a more focused design with only a few States selected for capacity building along
with the Center and more decentralized implementation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on outputs in
Annex 2)

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.
The rating of this project is complicated by the fact that there have been significant fluctuations in ratings
between QAG, ISRs and Mid-Term Reviews, and that there is an apparent disconnect between the
assessment of implementation and the attainment of the PDOs. The ICR team was inclined to rate the
achievement of PDOs as Moderately Satisfactory considering that stated objectives were largely attained.
This project was without precedent ­ the Bank has not had a large regulatory capacity building project in
the food and drug sector before. It was also a project of high complexity with many interfaces,
challenging for the Bank, but on the other hand exactly the kind of project for which the Bank has a
competitive advantage over other development partners. A complication occurred when the project
became one of those subjected to the DIR, which led to a degree of political insecurity on the
implementation side that temporarily slowed down decision making as well as may have influenced the
GOI's decision not to ask for an extension. The ICR team would have preferred to take a step back and
apply an overall rating based largely on the continuing relevance, the overall development impact and the
sustainability of the project, while addressing weaknesses in implementation and management through the
sub-category ratings. However, the awkward conclusion of an MU rating reflects consideration of the low
disbursements, and low levels of targeted outputs, and thus implied weak linkages between many the
project activities and the results attained.

Despite the implementation shortcomings the project was largely successful in achieving its overall
objectives. It contributed significantly to the strengthening of policies and regulatory capacity in the food
and drug sector. It also delivered a powerful network of resource centers for public and professional
education and training. The Center and some larger States with pre-existing capacity and major presence
of pharmaceutical industry with international exposure had greater benefits from the project than smaller
States with little presence of drug industry. These large States are dominant in terms of the share of their
industry of the total Indian market and corresponding regulatory activity. For example, Gujarat and
Maharashtra together perform more than 50% of all tests done by State drug quality control labs in India.
The labs of these two States were the best performers under the project, achieved National Accreditation
Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) certification and showed a marked increase in
output due to the investments made by the project.

Political status of regulatory functions, commitment of the political and administrative leadership,
visibility and overall funding improved significantly under the project. A significant part of the project
success was ensured in a "sprint to the finish" effort under the new project leadership at the MOHFW,
after a final supervision mission in February 2008 presented a range of serious implementation deficits.
Nevertheless, the fact that several deficiencies remain and regulatory capacity could not be upgraded to
the desirable level yet in some of the weaker States presents more than minor shortcomings in the overall
achievement of objectives.



                                                       14

The following achievements can be directly attributed to the project:

   · Nine2 out of ten policy studies are delivered and under review by the responsible government
        units. These studies cover aspects such as a review of existing drug laws and rules in the
        international context, role of public private partnership in regulation, motivation of staff working
        in food and drug regulation, pro-poor strategies and accountability to civil society, counterfeit
        drugs and related threats, post-marketing surveillance of drugs, health problems related to food
        and drug quality.
   · The project contributed, through on-going policy dialogue, to the preparation and adoption of a
        modern Integrated Food Law which was enacted in August 2006, and the setting up of an
        autonomous Central Food Authority. A similar autonomous Central Drug Authority is also under
        preparation.
   · Five Central Food Labs, eight State Food labs, one central drug lab and four State drug labs were
        newly constructed. Six Central food labs, five State food labs, one Central drug lab and seven
        State drug labs were renovated.
   · The positions required in the Central lab were created and partially filled with contract staff.
        Most of the positions for State labs are also sanctioned and many have been filled up or are in the
        process of recruitment. In some of the weaker States, newly built food labs were not yet or not
        fully utilized, due to delays on the State side in connecting utility services, providing adequate
        staffing or addressing minor deficiencies that limit utility of newly procured lab equipment. In
        some cases, output remained stagnant because posts for inspectors who bring in samples from the
        market have not yet been filled.
   · With support from WHO and industry associations, HACCP standards were developed for the
        five core sectors dairy, meat & poultry, fruits & vegetables, hospitality sector and bakery
        products. They have been harmonized with international Codex standards. Training programs
        were organized through industry associations to disseminate these standards. HACCP standards
        were also developed for the 30 most popular food items being served by street food vendors.
        These were disseminated to street food vendors through home science colleges.
   · The revised GMP standards (Schedule M) are now mandatory for all Indian drug manufacturers
        since June 2005. A comprehensive Schedule M training program for small scale industries and
        regulatory staff was implemented, with 1,331 staff from the private sector trained (project target:
        1055). A cadre of GMP inspectors across the country were nominated and trained. The tighter
        standards led to the demise of many small producers that could not meet Schedule M
        requirements. However, more needs to be done to uniformly enforce standards all over India.
   · The project facilitated establishment of India's National Pharmacovigilance (NPV) Program,
        commissioned in November 2004. The program built a network of reporting centers supported by
        zonal centers and a national coordination unit located at the All India Institute of Medial Sciences.
        About 12,000 adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have been reported; two drugs (Rofecoxib and
        Valdecoxib) have been banned by the GOI based on the recommendations of the NPV advisory
        committee. However, additional funding is required to maintain and improve reporting, data
        management and dissemination of relevant information among professionals.
   · Under the program, the GOI established the Indian Pharmacopeia Commission (IPC) as a
        registered society in December 2004 and as an autonomous body affiliated to MOHFW in 2008.
        The new Indian Pharmacopeia was published in 2007 along with new reference standards made
        available to industry and drug quality control labs. The sale of the Pharmacopoeia as well as
        reference standards creates revenue for the IPC. More than 300 monographs have been updated,



   2 See Annex 2


                                                      15

         46 new monographs prepared and for the first time holistic monographs for 23 botanical drugs
         have been included under the IPC.
    · Training in drug safety and quality was given to 2605 public and private sector personnel out of
         the planned 2625. The feedback from the participants indicated an increase in knowledge of
         Schedule M, process verification, validation, facility documentation, and Standard Operating
         Procedures. The National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education Research (NIPER), the nodal
         institution for this training, updated the training curriculum incorporating required skills and
         processes related to GMP certification. Hands-on training on instrumentation was provided for
         selected private sector participants for a nominal fee. Quality of training was well monitored. A
         total of 1205 people from the food sector were trained, including 473 food inspectors and 48
         public analysts.
    · There has been notable progress in public education on food and drug safety related issues, but in
         the absence of end line surveys it is difficult to assess the impact of these interventions. A mass
         media communication strategy for food hygiene and safety in purchase and use of prescription
         drugs was developed and fully implemented in line with a detailed media plan; actual coverage
         rates exceeded the target. A Street Food Survey was implemented together with action research
         to demonstrate which tools can be used to successfully modify provider behavior. An NGO-led
         outreach campaign for rural areas was successfully implemented by activating a network of
         NGOs with community connections and experience in effective outreach strategies that included
         street plays, workshops and assemblies, group activities around specially designed materials, wall
         writings and other creative forms of outreach to the local population.



3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost, and
comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

There is no established economic framework for the assessment of costs and benefits of food and drug
regulation, but given the size of the Indian domestic drug market (currently in the range of 13 billion USD
p.a.) and the role as one of the leading exporters of medicines to developed and developing countries
(current figure > 7 billion USD p.a.), the economic importance of a functioning regulatory system is
evident; data for the food sector are harder to obtain, therefore the medicines sector is used here to make
the point. Recent history (example Ranbaxy - withdrawal of license for import of drugs from one facility
into the US in fall 2008) shows that regulatory failure can have immediate and severe commercial impact.
Harder to quantify but even more important for our global development objectives is the health impact of
sub-standard or counterfeit drugs within India and abroad in particular in poor importing countries with
weak controls. In comparison, the project investment was less than one cent per capita of the Indian
population per year ­ a small amount for a project that made a significant contribution to the
strengthening of regulatory oversight in the food and drug sector.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating:

Ratings: Low to Negligible

Sustainability of the highlighted project success is likely in terms of overall funding and political support
for the sector on national level and in those States that took ownership and invested some of their own
resources to ensure project success. In fact, strong performer states have become role models for others.
Increasing international pressure on India as a leading exporter of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients
(APIs) and finished generic pharmaceuticals as well as internal pressure from companies that are
depending on international markets will ensure that the issue of drug regulation remains high on the
agenda. Additional partners and donors such as WHO, DFID, United States Food and Drug
Administration (USFDA), and Health Canada have initiated or are continuing support to Central and State
regulatory authorities. The NABL accreditation process is likely to be used to expose local inaction.
Further, capacity developed in private and academic sector and among NGOs serves as a foundation for
future programs, and systems and tools created can be shared widely. Minor additional spending on
accessories and application training would have major positive impact on utilization in some of the
weaker labs. Government of India (GOI) counterparts expressed their commitment to follow up and
address these issues urgently.

Lacking political commitment in weaker States is unlikely to undermine overall development outcomes,
although it will mean that some parts of India will take more time to catch up with international standards.
New legislation that is currently under preparation would transfer some critical functions from States to
the Center, which should lead to more uniformity for the control and enforcement of manufacturing
standards.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)


5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Quality at Entry review in July 2003 assessed the project as Satisfactory overall and in all its
dimensions, except Environmental Aspects which were rated as Highly Satisfactory.

         The strengths mentioned by the QAG included: (i) appropriate design and timely focus on food
         and drug quality and safety issues; (ii) well focused DOs on the outcomes in terms of the main
         capacity building objectives of the project; (iii) the project objectives are more in tune with
         country realities, covering the center and the states; (iv) clear partnership arrangements; (v)
         detailed and well designed staff and management training; (vi) the candor in its risk assessment.
         Bank inputs and processes have some strong aspects; and (vii) peer reviewers were well chosen,
         with participation from the anchor.

         Areas needing improvements suggested by the QAG included: (i) need to outline the measures to
         be considered for leadership and coordination of the new laboratories; (ii) details on establishing
         a fee-for-service system for lab testing or for licensing production facilities for drugs and foods
         and street vendors; (iii) staff training on facility and vendor licenses as well as on compliance
         with safety regulations, HACCP and GMPs; and (iv) addressing how state regulatory efforts
         would be better coordinated with other states and federal authorities.

According to the ICR team, the Bank's performance in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the
project was moderately satisfactory. On the one hand, the identification process focused on critical gaps
and opportunities for interventions in India's health sector. The project supported the health goals of the
CAS, and the government's 15 year strategy which aimed to improve food and drug safety and harmonize
Indian norms with internationally accepted standards. The project was thus timely because of the
increasing world focus on safety issues and the future World Trade Organization (WTO) membership
implications for India.

During preparation and appraisal, the Bank also took into account the adequacy of project design and all
major relevant aspects, such as technical, financial, economic, and institutional, including procurement
and financial management. In addition, major risk factors and lessons learned from other earlier projects
in the social sector were considered and incorporated into the project design. Project preparation was
carried out with an adequate number of specialists who provided the technical skill mix necessary to
address project concerns. The Bank provided adequate resources in terms of staff weeks and dollar
amount to ensure quality preparation and appraisal work.

On the other hand, in hindsight, the project appears to have had a few design flaws: (i) it was assumed
that a nationwide project could be done through a centralized agency; (ii) the scope of the project could
have been limited to a few states as a pilot, instead of covering the whole country; (iii) a phased approach
through an APL rather than an investment loan might have been better; (iv) funds flow arrangements
could have been done in a different way rather than using the existing State Aids Control Societies, which



                                                        18

in practice did not take any interest in the project. As a result, funds which were made available through
these Societies could not be used properly; and (v) due to frequent turnover of Joint Secretary and
Director and the absence of a Director exclusive for the project, the PCU did not receive adequate
attention.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The project was subjected to a second QAG review, when a Quality of Supervision Assessment was
carried out in September 2006. The panel rated the overall quality of supervision of this project in FY05-
06 as Satisfactory. Focus on Development Effectiveness, Supervision of Fiduciary/Safeguard Aspects,
Adequacy of Supervision Inputs and Processes as well as Candor and Quality of ISRs were also rated
Satisfactory.

QAG noted that:

          "Supervision was proactive, with monthly follow-up and integration into ministerial meetings,
          additional to the regular missions every six months. The team quickly identified the need for a
          full-time project coordinator not originally envisaged in design, and pressed for recruitment of a
          senior, suitably qualified official. This step was critical to implementation. The team also put
          considerable effort into strengthening relationships with consumer activists and the private
          sector, and worked in collaboration with WHO and DFID. Supervision was focused on results
          from the capacity building, monitoring through surveys and independent evaluations the
          benefits of the training provided under the project.

          The team's approach has been effectively supported by sector and country management so that
          supervision is well integrated on a programmatic basis. Continuity in the team was high and in
          the panel's view crucial to substantive resolution of issues quickly as they emerged.
          Supervision put emphasis on recruitment of a suitably qualified coordinator to speed up
          implementation. The Bank also helped streamline the approval process of government, by
          reducing the number of procurement evaluation committees from three to two.

          Based on the Bank's recommendations, the government streamlined the procurement process by
          establishing an integrated purchase committee (instead of two committees earlier) and setting
          up of an Empowered Procurement Wing (EPW) to oversee all the procurement handled by
          various divisions of MOHFW. The Bank also supported strengthening of the state and central
          level procurement staff through training programs, both national and international.
          The Task Team performed a very credible job with a client that initially demonstrated a certain
          degree of reluctance to implement environmental safeguard measures. The effort of the Task
          Team was instrumental in bringing about change in the Borrower attitude toward these issues."

While the ICR team concurs with many of the above findings of QAG, the team's opinion on the Bank's
supervision is as follows:

On the one hand, the task team prepared Aide Memoires regularly and alerted the government and the
PCU to problems with project execution and facilitated remedies in a timely manner, in conformity with
Bank procedures. The Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) realistically rated the performance of the




                                                      19

project both in terms of achievement of development objectives and project implementation. Further, the
task team had high staff continuity with good skills mix.

Bank's procurement and financial management staff worked with PCU staff to explain the rules and
procedures to be applied during project implementation, with regard to procurement of goods and works,
and selection of consultants, accounts and audits, based on the Loan and Project Agreement. The
procurement specialist based in the country office was closely involved in all project supervision missions
and contributed to the task team to address procurement-related issues in an appropriate manner.

For the financial management, one on-site supervision mission was performed per year in addition to desk
reviews as projected in the supervision plan. Subsequent inputs were made and adequately reflected in
Aide Memoires and ISRs. Audit reports were reviewed timely and then followed-up by letter of
comments sent to the borrower within two weeks. As the audit reports were unqualified, improvement of
financial management (FM) systems and Financial Monitoring Report (FMR) quality and timeliness were
the main FM issues identified and followed up by the team.

The task team carried out a Mid-Term Review in February 2006 and assessed progress to date on all
project components, the implementation issues and the actions to be taken to ensure the successful
completion of the project. To the above extent, the Bank performance appears "Satisfactory".

However, if one looks at the overall effectiveness of the Bank's engagement with the GOI in terms of
correcting identified deficiencies that had a major impact on the performance of project components, the
impression is not as positive. The Bank had the option to restructure the project and reduce some of the
complexity that turned out to be a drag on performance, or make it clear that it might suspend the project
if the GOI did not meet its commitments. It appears in hindsight that staff and management were
somewhat complacent in hoping that meetings and correspondence alone would create enough motivation
for the client to address the bureaucratic hurdles affecting performance. Another factor appears to have
been the (as it turned out, incorrect) assumption that there would be a project extension that would
provide additional time to address deficiencies.

In light of these shortcomings, which can be considered "major" in terms of their effects on project
performance, and despite the fact that the team made a considerable effort to flag issues and follow-up
with the borrower, the overall quality of supervision is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Based on the Bank performance during lending phase and supervision as discussed above, overall Bank
performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The government's commitment and ownership to the project was initially demonstrated by the following:
The project was included in the 10th Five Year Plan and the MOHFW was keen to start implementation
in FY 2003-04. Seventeen States had provided Letters of Undertaking for effectively implementing the
project. An Environmental Management Plan was prepared and disseminated as per IDA disclosure
policy. Site surveys were completed for five major civil works planned for the second year and
preliminary plans were prepared. Notice for the project's procurement was published in the United



                                                      20

Nations Development Business in December 2002. A qualified finance professional was appointed to the
PCU and a draft finance manual was prepared. Draft terms of reference had been prepared for most
studies and consultancies were also planned.

However, during implementation, the government commitment appears to have wavered as demonstrated
by the following:

    · Project coordination remained weak during most of the project period. Strong coordination was
         necessary given the far flung activities and the need for constant interaction with the project states.
         The Joint Secretary in charge of the project changed four times during five years of
         implementation, likewise, the Director overseeing the PCU also changed four times, and there
         was a high rate of attrition among the consultants in the PCU itself.

    · Since the beginning and for the most part, routine project management was left to the PCU, which
         entirely consisted of consultants. To be effective, PCU required clear guidance and strong
         support, which was missing. Further, the PCU was not taken seriously by the States.

    · The government also did not succeed in providing the planned, critical staffing at the central and
         the state levels, both in the food and drug offices and in the laboratories. Under the project 103
         analysts were to be recruited for the central food and drug testing laboratories. This action was
         inordinately delayed and the agreement to engage a human resource agency to supply these staff
         on contract basis took a long time to materialize. Without this essential input, regulation could not
         be improved significantly.

    · Monitoring the output of the laboratories was weak, with even the central laboratories not
         reporting on all the five agreed lab capacity indicators. MOHFW did carry out quarterly reviews
         with the states but for several reasons, these produced limited results.

    · There were several deficiencies in civil works and equipment implementation, which affected
         implementation progress.

    · Involvement of the technical functions ­ food and drug regulators ­ was insufficient while their
         contribution would have been key to optimize the results of the project.

While the issues listed above would justify an "Unsatisfactory" rating, it has to be acknowledged that the
new team on the client side made a major effort to address project weaknesses during the final months of
the project and was able to achieve significant improvements over the status found in early 2008. The
rating for the final period thus would be "Satisfactory", which leads to an overall rating of Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The project coordination remained weak during most of the project period and picked up only during the
last six months of the project, mostly to complete the infrastructure activities and project accounts. Strong
coordination was necessary given the country-wide activities and the need for constant interaction with
the project states, which was mostly lacking.

Financial Management. Compliance with financial management aspects was inconsistent, with delays in
financial reporting and in submission of audit reports which resulted in periodic discontinuation of SOE



                                                      21

based disbursements. This was partly due to delays in financial reporting from the large number of
implementing entities albeit with low levels of expenditure and inadequate follow up/attention to these
issues by the CPMU. The FM status of the project was initially moderately satisfactory in view of the
slow take off and low level of expenditure in the three initial years. However in early FY 2007-08 both
the finance staff in the PCU resigned and with no replacement, there was limited attention to the financial
management issues which had since then remained unsatisfactory with pending financial reports and audit
reports and no reimbursement claims submitted for the expenditures incurred in FY 2007-08. Since
February 2008, disbursements under the project were discontinued due to non receipt of acceptable audit
reports for both the central and the state components for the year 2006-07.

Procurement: M/s HSCC Limited, a company owned by the MOHFW, acted as the PSA for central level
procurement of equipment and civil works under the project. Right from beginning, the progress on
procurement was slow and by the second year, it was realized that the procurement of complex equipment
required much higher level of expertise than what was originally envisaged. Moreover, the draft bid
evaluation reports prepared by HSCC were subject to further scrutiny by the project steering committee of
MOHFW, which decided to reverse many contract award recommendations made by HSCC. This led to
major delays in deciding the award of contracts in many cases. MOHFW reversed the recommendations
of HSCC without providing a valid justification in few cases, resulting in the Bank's inability to issue the
No Objection for the proposed contract award. It also appears that States lacked ownership for the project,
which is evident in not expediting necessary clearances for the civil works. The PCU of MOHFW was
quite ineffective in overall coordination and, in last two years of the project, it was impossible to get the
list of contracts issued at state level or the list of contracts (apart from those handled by HSCC) issued at
central level, resulting in Bank not able to conduct the post review of these contracts. The Bank also
received many complaints including some alleging fraud and corruption in procurement processes.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

In light of the Government and PCU performance as discussed above, the overall performance of the
Borrower was moderately unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)


Important factors for the success of a project:

     · A strong implementing agency is a very important factor for the success of a project. A PCU
         staffed only by consultants with low job security and high turnover is not adequate for managing
         such a project (General applicability)

Project Design:

     · When starting a reform program in a difficult area such as improvement in food and drug quality
         and safety, it is prudent to be less ambitious in what can be achieved in the first operation and to
         build capacity for implementing reforms over the long term
     · Being the first of its kind in the Bank, the project was challenging in its innovative features and
         scope. The project required continuing attention to policy and institution building at the Central
         and State levels, as well as interacting effectively with a wide range of stakeholders. On this
         background, it could have been better to carry out an Economic and Sector Work (ESW) or



                                                         22

      Analytical and Advisory Activity (AAA) to identify the problems in the sector and also confirm
      whether there was sufficient commitment, interest, and ownership on the part of the central
      government and participating states. This might have enabled the Bank to focus on areas where
      achievements are possible and avoid those aspects that were not operationally feasible in a Bank
      project
   · Also, being a new area, it would have been more realistic to limit the scope of the project to a few
      states, which would have given the Bank and the Central government an opportunity to collect
      implementation experiences and better demonstrate impact

   Human Resources:

   · Prior to launching the project, the administrative steps necessary and time requirements for
      creating positions and recruiting public servants could have been investigated and addressed
      proactively on a high level in order to avoid the delays in creating and filling positions
      encountered during implementation (General applicability)
   · Capacity building for complex regulatory functions needs a well coordinated approach. To
      achieve a significant increase in quality and quantity of lab tests for example, it is not sufficient to
      build a new lab, hire lab staff and procure equipment. At the same time, the number of inspectors
      who collect samples in the field also needs to be increased to provide the additional samples and
      make use of the increased lab capacity
   · Standards for implementation of the food and drug laws in the States should be defined and
      harmonized. Currently, there is a huge variation across the states for example in the number of
      inspectors relative to population and manufacturing outlets, as well as in inspection quality and
      standards. A national working group could be formed to agree on common standards and provide
      guidance for State governments

Procurement:

   · In addition to a specialized procurement agency, a few qualified procurement staff are required at
      PCU level for drafting technical specifications, procurement planning, coordination with the
      procurement agent, monitoring State/district level procurement, inventory management, capacity
      building of States, collecting data regarding contracts issued under the project and monitoring
      utilization of supplies made etc. Such staff should have reasonable tenure to provide continuity
      and this requirement should be added as a covenant for the project (General applicability)
   · The institutional mechanism for procurement could be reviewed in more detail at appraisal stage
      so that unnecessary delays at implementation stage can be avoided. Strengthening of complaint
      management, drafting non-restrictive generic specifications and disclosure of procurement
      information are other areas to focus on. (General applicability)
   · It is important to have qualified pre-dispatch and post installation inspection of complex
      equipment prior to releasing payment
   · The Bank needs to provide more supervision resources for complex projects, including
      specialized technical support, and take a more decisive approach in restructuring a project if
      implementation quality is chronically weak (General applicability)
   · Procurement of simple office equipment and standard lab equipment could be done better locally
      in States, possibly under a framework contract that provides favorable terms and prices
   · Centralized procurement of high-end equipment needs significantly more communication with
      the end users to avoid frequent minor problems that render the equipment useless or put an
      unnecessary burden on the end users, who have to make additional investments before they can
      utilize the equipment. Maintenance contracts should be procured together with the equipment




                                                   23

    · Supplier service during warranty appeared to be problematic for some of the expensive
        equipment; Suppliers seem to treat State labs as low margin clients and know that it is difficult
        for public sector entities to take action against firms that do not comply with contractual
        obligations. Price advantages due to central procurement are meaningless if the equipment
        cannot be used as planned
    · Alternative to purchasing, leasing or in-sourcing of expensive equipment could be considered (as
        it is routine in the private sector) to avoid the pitfalls mentioned above. The advantage is that the
        incentive for the provider to offer good services is higher if the payment is made in annual
        installments for a defined service level rather than upfront for a piece of equipment
    · Due to limitation of resources to effectively supervise decentralized procurement, there is a need
        for the Bank to limit its funding to only central level procurement or to focus on a few states only
        (General applicability).
    · While it is possible to reduce the possibility of fraud and corruption in Bank funded projects to
        some extent, it is not realistic to assume that fraud and corruption could be eliminated only by
        increased supervision. These are due to systemic deficiencies and could only be sustainably
        addressed by focusing on strengthening country system through a continuous engagement
        (General applicability). .

Funds flow and financial management:
    · The project design could have limited financing only for the Central component and not for the
        minor expenditures at the State levels. In case State level activities are considered critical to meet
        the project objectives, adequate incentives need to be provided & built into the project design to
        ensure that both utilization of available funds and as well as the financial management procedures
        at the State level are in compliance with the Bank's policies.

Laboratory strengthening:

(a) Equipment:

    · The capabilities of the participating laboratories should be assessed before procurement is done.
        The list of instruments should be gone through and validated against the desired scope and
        throughput of lab tests. If accreditation of the laboratories is an important aspect, then automation
        and documentation features could form part of the technical specifications and be ordered along
        with the equipment. The participating laboratories should be involved in the entire process of
        procurement
    · Delivery of new equipment, installation, validation and application training need to be closely
        supervised by the procuring unit in order to ensure the full functioning of specialized equipment

(b) Civil works:

    · The design of specialized areas like "Microbiology Labs" should be vetted by appropriate
        technical agency. The user inputs should be recorded and all necessary details incorporated before
        tendering
    · For repetitive projects like laboratories, a standard set of technical specifications for various items
        including plumbing and electrical fitting could be prepared and validated by independent experts.
        This would avoid inappropriate and ad hoc decisions by site engineers
    · The onus of obtaining utility connections (electricity and water) for the facility could be built into
        the contract to avoid delay in making the facility functional before the defect liability period
    · The defect list jointly prepared by the agency that got the work executed and the user should be
        submitted to the bank within fixed time frame (90 days) from the date of completion of work


                                                       24

    · An independent authority along with executing authority should check the rectifications and list if
       any other defects surfaced during the said period. The said report along with NOC from user
       should be procured before the expiry of defect liability period and release of secured advance

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Policy Development, Project Coordination and Monitoring

Policy Development: Out of the ten policy reviews/studies planned nine were completed:
     1. Options for Improving Post Market Surveillance and Monitoring Adverse Drugs Reactions
     2. Review of Existing Laws and Rules for Promoting Drug Quality in the light of Recent Changes
         in the International Trade and Business Environment
     3. Options for Improving Information Collection on Health Problem Associated with Food and
         Drugs Quality
     4. Specific Roles in Public and Private Partnership in areas such as Rule making, Auditing,
         Reporting on Compliance and Integrating Inputs into Food and Drugs Registration
     5. Rationalization of Manpower Requirement and Functions of CDSCO
     6. Long Term Vision and Action for Rationalizing the number of formulations in the Indian
         Pharmaceutical Market
     7. Measures for Improving Governance especially in Markets Prioritized by the Poor and for
         tapping Consumer Feedback
     8. Options for Motivating Staff to maintain Professional Standard both in Inspection, Duties and in
         Lab
     9. Rapid Assessment Survey on Spurious Drugs in India with Evidence based and Statistically
         Validated

Monitoring: The project undertook two large scale surveys: (i) a national household survey covering
20,250 households across the country on household behaviors relating to food and drug safety and
quality; and (ii) a street food survey on the safety and quality of street foods which led to about 20 action
research activities in 18 cities through partnership with 18 home science colleges throughout the country.

However, no follow-up survey was done after the intervention due to lack of time.

Management Information System: All 101 completed project locations received the hardware; 5 day user
training was completed for selected staff in all locations. Migration of historic data (3 years) started with
digitalization of 80,000 out of the 150,000 estimated records. However, there was no progress of
computerization started by GOI in the drug sector due to a pending change in legislation that would create
an independent drug authority.

Component 2: Food Safety

Consumer Awareness: Substantial progress was made in consumer education. This included the
development of the mass media communication strategy and messages for food hygiene and safety in
purchase and use of prescription drugs; the progress in developing a Civic Engagement Strategy and
Action Plan through the Task Force on Civic Engagement; and completion of the Street Food Survey and
other surveys that have informed the consumer education strategy development process.

HACCP: With support from WHO and industry associations HACCP standards were developed for five
core sectors which included dairy, meat & poultry, fruits and vegetables, hospitality sector and bakeries
and bakery products. HACCP standards were also developed for some 30 most popular food items being
served by street food vendors. These are being disseminated to street food vendors through home science
colleges. Training programs were organized through industry associations to disseminate these standards.




                                                      27

Training: 473 food inspectors and 48 public analysts trained against the target of 2000 food inspectors
and 500 public analysts. Since September 2007, no new training was offered by Central Food
Technology and Research Institute (CFTRI), the nodal institute coordinating training in this sector. Lack
of information on number of participants (especially from private sector) to be trained from a large
number of States, poor response from food regulatory staff due to heavy demands on their time from other
health programs and failure to release funds in time were the main factors which contributed to slow
progress in training.

Laboratory Strengthening: the table below shows the number and location of food and drug labs that
were newly built or renovated under the project

Component 3: Drug Quality and Safety:

Development and Dissemination of Indian Pharmacopeia Standards: The GOI established the Indian
Pharmacopeia Commission (IPC) as a registered society in December 2004, and as an autonomous body
affiliated to MOHFW in 2008 commendable progress. The new Indian Pharmacopeia 2007 was published
along with reference standards and sale of the Pharmacopoeia is brining in revenues to the IPC. More
than 300 monographs have been updated, 46 new monographs prepared, and for the first time holistic
monographs for 23 botanical drugs have been included under the IPC.

Pharmacovigilance: The project facilitated establishment of India's National Pharmaco-Vigilance (NPV)
Program which got commissioned in November 2004. The program has a net work of reporting centers



                                                    28

supported by zonal centers and national coordination unit located at the All India Institute of Medial
Sciences. About 12,000 adverse drug reactions (ADRs) following administration of drugs have been
reported, and two drugs (Rofecoxib and Valdecoxib) have been banned by the GOI based on the
recommendations of the NPV advisory committee. However, failure to provide funding in time adversely
affected the reporting and coordination. Further, effective use of the data is limited as no systematic
database has been established.

Training: Training in drug safety and quality was given to 2605 public and private sector personnel out
of the planned 2625 to be trained. Hands-on training on instrumentation was provided for selected private
sector participants charging a nominal fee. Quality of training was well monitored.

Good Manufacturing Practices: Training of production and analytical staff from small scale industries
and those working in private testing laboratories exceeded the planned target and so far 1,331 such
personnel from private sector trained (project target: 1055)

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results
(if any)
                Intensive Learning Implementation Completion Report (ILI) Workshop

To fulfill the requirements for an Intensive Learning ICR, four regional feedback and learning workshops
were organized in Hyderabad, Mumbai, Raipur and Kolkata in September 2008. The workshops were
attended by staff from State Health Ministry Officials and food and drug laboratories.

The learning workshops yielded a very consistent feedback: the project was seen as overall useful but
generally too complex in design, with too many layers involved in every decision leading to frequent
communication breakdowns and delays. Lack of adequate central project management was criticized by
all State participants. The high number of States that were selected as beneficiaries as well as the failure
of the central bureaucracy to provide adequate staffing for the Project Coordination Unit was mentioned
as complicating factors for the implementation.

The key messages from the workshops and the lessons learned are outlined below:

A. Positive Outcomes:

    · The project provided visibility for this important oversight function which is otherwise neglected
         by most State Governments
    · The productivity of the labs has improved. For example: (a) the average number of samples tested
         per month by an analyst in drug testing laboratory in Hyderabad has increased from 12 to 15. As
         a result total number of samples tested increased from 4,741 in 2003 to 5,514 in 2007; (b)
         throughput of drug lab could be increased from 3600 samples per year to 6000 in Mumbai and
         2500 in Aurangabad (total 8500); this is equal to 20% of all samples in India tested per year; (c)
         In Gujarat, capacity increased by 20% from 5000 to 6000 samples per year (drug lab Vadodara)
    · Some of the quantitative tests such as estimation of Caffeine, Aflatoxins and heavy metals that
         were not being done in the past are now being undertaken
    · While project inputs could have been made subject to recruitment of staff, there could have been
         a risk that even these achievements would not have been there as creation and positioning of staff
         is generally a long drawn process
    · In many States, project led to significant upgrading of labs; with new ceilings, floors and air
         conditioning in several labs and new furniture
    · In Mumbai: (a) all received equipment is in use and operates as expected; (b) The Commissioner
         and analysts are satisfied; (c) overall effect of project was that awareness for importance of food
         and drug regulation went up, job is easier now for the commissioner with support from State and
         industry; (d) test results are more accurate; (e) process has been improved (all computerized, no
         manipulation possible, consistent coding of samples); (f) credibility among industry and public
         increased; and (g) NABL accreditation was received in August 2008; (h) wide range of
         communication materials were produced for use mainly in schools; focus on food safety and drug
         safety; campaign seen as very successful; (i) identified counterfeit cosmetics with the help of lab
         technology provided by the project. This led to high visibility in the media and significant gain in
         public support for the FDA. State court judges came to learn about the issue of counterfeiting

B. Project Shortcomings:
   · Significant communication gaps from the central project coordination unit on inputs being
       provided under the project resulting in confusion about the scope. The accountability for decision
       making was diluted. There was no forum for regular discussion between the key stakeholders
   · The funds flow arrangement agreed for the project through the State AIDS control societies
       resulted in considerable delays as these societies are not familiar with the project
   · The project design did not take into account differences in the organizational arrangements of
       food and drugs sector in each state which resulted in funds flow and communication problems
       about project inputs and activities
   · Lack of effective coordination of the inputs provided under different GOI schemes. For example,
       the drug lab constructed under GOI funding could not be handed over for the past 3 years due to
       failure to reach closure on contracting issues; as a result the equipment supplied under the project
       was installed in the old lab
   · Full benefit from the project could not be accrued for the laboratory strengthening component due
       to poor coordination
   · A significant part of the equipment approved under the project could not be supplied. Some
       equipment was supplied but is not in working condition, for example: out of 15 pieces of
       equipment supplied to Tamil Nadu, one (AAS) was supplied in broken condition
   · In Mumbai, only 40% of equipment that was sanctioned under the project was delivered before
       project closure
   · Despite the inputs provided under the project there are serious space constraints in many States
   · The States need technical support for getting NABL accreditation
   · It is important to provide standards for pesticide residues
   · In West Bengal, overall experience with the project was not positive, impact was limited,
       sustainability questionable, and labs are in bad condition: (a) only a limited number of equipment
       was delivered from to the initially approved list; (b) No paperwork provided with delivery (on
       warranty, AMC contract, calibration, specifications of equipment), making it very difficult to
       maintain the equipment in a functional state (observed in all States equally); (c) Several pieces of
       expensive equipment are not fully usable because installation was done without proper instruction,
       spare parts are required and cannot be procured easily, accessories are needed and were not
       provided or infrastructure limitations prevent adequate utilization; (d) The lab building that was
       sanctioned was never built partially due to local inaction, infighting with the city government; (e)
       Some posts were created and filled with contract staff (5 in the food lab) but on the other hand the
       State-funded posts that exist on paper are not filled (out of 65 food inspector posts, 38 are
       vacant); (f) Communication problems between labs, State authorities, central authorities and
       implementing units; (g) Training was provided for food lab staff, but only 4 analysts were trained
       (plus 16 clerical staff most of which have been transferred to other locations in the meantime. On
       the drug lab side, 28 people (officers and analysts) were trained and experience with training was
       positive
   · In Orissa, construction work is ongoing at the Food lab to upgrade an old building (financed by
       the State) ­ several highly sensitive instruments that were delivered under the project cannot be
       used due to dusty conditions (GLC, Microwave Digestion Unit, HPLC and others). Capacity
       currently is only 300-400 samples per year
   · In Sikkim, building is finished but there are problems with utilities; building is not optimal,
       rooms too small and not enough space for the equipment that was received

C. Training:

   · NIPER training provided by project was perceived as effective and positive in impact on
       professional performance. However, there was feedback from some labs that training at NIPER


                                                    34

        was only theoretical while parts of the audience require more practical, hands-on training. In
        some cases the learning could not be implemented on a day-to-day basis due to non-availability
        of reference standards. Two months CDL training would be more appropriate for lab analysts as it
        provides more practical training
   · It is important to have: (a) training in locations where industry is more sophisticated, providing
        opportunities to benefit from private sector experts; and (b) exposure visits and international
        training for the regulatory and laboratory staff

D. Staffing:

   · In Maharashtra, no positions were paid by the project, but several new positions provided by the
        State; good synergies between project and State agenda. State is expected to pay for additional
        upgrades, proposal submitted for budgets 2009/2010. Number of inspectors will be doubled over
        the next 6 months from 80 to 161; total throughput of samples will then increase to 11500 per
        year
   · In Gujarat, out of 87 posts for inspectors, only 27 are filled; the problem is to find qualified
        candidates; This problem will be addressed by reducing entry requirements and providing two
        years training on the job
   · In Orissa, of 41 inspector posts, only 20 are filled (1 inspector for about 3 million population). No
        staff was sanctioned under project
   · In Chhattisgarh, 15 additional posts were created (total now 30), and recruiting has started.
        Inspectorate is understaffed: of 40 posts for drug and 20 for food inspectors, only 4 each are filled
   · In Sikkim, four posts have been created but they are not yet filled

E. Sustainability:

   · In many States, project outcomes are sustainable as State governments are expected to provide
        the necessary funding for completing construction, hiring staff etc. This is demonstrated in
        Maharashtra through filling of some gaps that were left under project procurement (accessories
        missing etc); no problem to finance consumables and maintenance. On the other hand, in Sikkim,
        government support to fix problems has not yet been requested, and hence, sustainability is
        unclear

F. Lessons Learned

   · National working group idea welcomed by participants
   · Working directly with States much preferred over working through Center
   · Focus on few States that can be made "champions", idea of reference labs endorsed
   · Technical and managerial support from Bank very welcomed and needed
   · Simpler project structure, modular and sequential with later integration of weaker States
   · Two key success criteria: (i) number of samples handled and (ii) NABL accreditation
   · Standards for implementation of laws are missing; States are left alone to a large extent. As part
        of a new project, such standards could be defined (possibly as a range given the different
        economic basis of States) for example in number of inspectors per population, number of tests
        performed, minimum requirements for drug/food lab capacity, timeline until NABL accreditation
        is becoming mandatory etc.
   · On State level, an integrated plan is needed to build capacity. Number of inspectors who collect
        samples, staffing level of labs, building capacity and infrastructure, equipment including
        maintenance and consumables all need to be considered in an integrated fashion because each
        factor can become a bottleneck


                                                     35

   · Project management needs to be strengthened and communication pathways shortened. Decision
      making has to be delegated as far down as possible and feedback loops need to be established
   · Projects need to be more focused, working with a few States is better than trying to cover the
      entire country
   · Incentives for good performance could be established; parameters in this field are easily
      measurable: number of samples processed and NABL accreditation
   · Food and Drug regulation are somewhat different in nature and only drug regulation has a
      significant external (international) benefit (India is largest exporter of generic drugs); it may be
      better to separate the two areas in a new project in order to reduce complexity

G. Way forward:

   · Create a working group to undertake a situation analysis of public drug testing laboratories and
      create standards and approaches for strengthening and revamping the drug labs across the country
      and establish model labs in four regions
   · Ensure that the inputs provided under the project are fully functional, focusing on low hanging
      fruit:
      (i)      Hands on application training for the sophisticated software controlled instruments like
               Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer, High Perfusion Liquid Chromatograph, Gas
               Chromatograph, Spectrophotometer as the training provided by the supplier is limited to
               handling the equipment
      (ii)     Readjustment of spares/equipment supplied to ensure availability of right equipment at
               the right place
      (iii)    Organize workshops in Gujarat/Maharashtra where the laboratories supported under the
               project received NABL accreditation to share experiences and distribute soft copies of the
               protocols
   · The issue reference standards requires a careful review and different options need to be explored
      including Indian Pharmacopeia playing active role like USP or establishing PPP as being done in
      the past in India
   · Seed funding for networking and information sharing between south Indian states to create a
      forum for sharing implementation experiences and exposure visits once a year.
   · A national strategy is required to address the concern of establishing uniform standards for
      reference laboratories (space, equipment and staff)
   · Even though the project has closed, completing the pending activities is important taking in to
      consideration the larger gains from such inputs
   · Strengthening of enforcement wing is required by identifying a nodal officer for prompt
      notification and communicating with other states about spurious and not of standard quality drugs
      (at present this is taking up to 2 months)
   · To minimize inconsistencies between state labs and central reference labs, it is important to
      develop Standard Operating Procedures and make reference standards available
   · It is important to engage the users while finalizing the equipment specifications and requirements
   · Sophisticated equipment requires adequate funding for maintenance after project closure
   · Adequate competencies in the core team to run the equipment is essential; analysts should be
      trained to do different tests so that they can back each other up
   · Information sharing needs to be improved by the establishment of a vigilance/intelligence wing to
      facilitate speedy exchange of information on spurious and sub-standard drugs. It is also useful to
      disclose information on sub-standard drugs on the web sites of drugs control authorities

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1. Introduction

Supervision of quality of food and drug is an essential function of the public health authorities. This item
lies in the concurrent list of Indian Constitution, and thus the responsibility is shared between the Central
& the State Governments. The basic legal framework in the sector is guided by the central legislations viz.
Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940, which assigns role to both the Central & the State Governments. The drug
sector is slightly better organized. Central Government is primarily responsible for development of policy
and guidelines as also for dealing with import and export matters while the State Government is primarily
responsible for enforcement. The organization of DCGI is at the apex of this sector in the center. There
are Central laboratories, which function both as appellate laboratories as well as perform other functions,
while the primary testing is done by State Laboratories.

Over the years, India has developed large food and drug industries, which are expanding rapidly. The
pharmaceutical industry now ranks as the third largest in the world. The annual growth rate of this
industry is over 10%. Drugs are now widely available and pharmaceuticals are a large and growing
component of health care expenditure. Furthermore, India has also emerged as a major exporter of drugs
esp. generic drugs. It has also been a long term goal of the Government of India to increase its
competitiveness in the international market apart for improving health outcomes of its citizens by
enhancing the quality of foods and drugs.

With the growing urbanization, there is an increased consumption of processed food products- both
imported and domestic. At the same time, the international trade is also expanding. The harmonization of
standards has also gained momentum from international initiatives viz. CODEX, which aim at both
facilitating international trade as well as protecting health of consumers everywhere.

As the food and drugs industries expand there is an increasing concern for consumer protection from
unsafe and poor quality of food and drugs, while there are regulations for quality assurance, enforcement
is weak and outdated.

Major issues identified at the time of commencement of the project related to insufficient public
awareness of food and drug safety, issues of drug quality, weak enforcement of existing regulations,
inadequate capacity of food and drug laboratories in terms of type and volume of tests, slow adoption of
state of the art technologies and methods and lack of pharmaco-vigilance programme. The Food and Drug
Capacity Building Project was designed against the above backdrop. It aimed to create an enabling
regulatory environment which promoted quality and safety of foods and drugs. The project focused on
development of analytical and sampling capacity, policy reforms related to aligning the legislation and
standards with the international standards, promoting self regulation, transparency, focus on processes
and prevention, enhancing consumer awareness and participation, changing training philosophy to hands-
on training, improving dialogue among the regulatory agencies and stakeholders and inclusion of private
sector analysts.

2. Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

The main objective of the project was to improve the quality and safety of foods and drugs in India by
strengthening the regulatory framework and incorporating components of consumer education and public-
private partnerships.

Key Indicators were:



                                                       37

    · The Government develops recommendations and options for appropriate policies and measures
        for improving food and drugs quality and safety, in line with its new approach.
    · Increased consumer awareness and knowledge (to be measured through household surveys).
    · Increased capacity, quality and timeliness of food and drug testing (to be measured through audits
        by independent experts.
    · HACCP standards and procedures are developed and introduced in selected priority food sectors.


3. Project Components and Description

The project consisted of the following three main components:

Component 1: Policy Development, Program Coordination and Monitoring (US$7.0 million)

This component consisted of policy development; strengthening of the central government food and drug
agencies; and improved program coordination and monitoring. Specific activities included Policy
Development, Program Coordination, Central Facilities and Staffing and Monitoring.


Component 2: Food Safety (US$44.3 million)

This component consisted of activities to strengthen the government's oversight and regulatory capacity
for food safety at the central and State levels including strengthening and development of new labs,
education of consumers on matters related to food safety, development of HACCP protocols for selected
sectors of food industry and up-gradation of related skills in the private sector.


Component 3: Drugs Quality and Safety (US$21.6 million)

This component was to consist of activities to strengthen the government's oversight and regulatory
capacity for ensuring drugs quality at the central and State levels including creation or strengthening of
labs, education of consumers on matters related to drugs quality and safety, and up-gradation of skills in
the private sector, updation and dissemination of pharmaceutical standards etc.

4. Achievement of Development Objectives


The following key achievements illustrate success in achieving developmental objectives:

    · Nine out of ten policy studies envisaged in the Project were conducted. The areas covered by
        these studies include review of existing drug laws and rules in context of emerging international
        trade and business scenario, role of public private partnership in food and drug regulation,
        motivation of staff working in food and drug regulatory work, regulatory governance that focus
        on poor and improve accountability to civil society, spurious drugs and related threats, post-
        marketing surveillance of drugs, health problems related to food and drug quality. These studies
        have contributed to the dialogue leading to legislative and regulatory changes mentioned below.




                                                    38

· As a result of the discussions stimulated by the Project, an integrated food legislation
  incorporating recent advances in the sector was drafted and finally enacted in August 2006. This
  led to setting up of an autonomous Central Food Standard and Safety Authority.

· The Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 has been amended to enhance the penal provisions for
  offences related to spurious drugs.

· A Bill to amend the Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 was introduced in the Parliament in order to
  set up an independent Central Drug Authority. The Select Committee of the Parliament has
  submitted its recommendations, which are under the consideration of the Government.

· Since June 2005, revised GMP standards have been enforced for all manufacturers. Both the
  inspectors and private sector personnel have been trained. This has led to weeding out of
  manufacturers not meeting the revised standards. However, the enforcement is not yet uniform
  across the country.

· Indian Pharmacopeia Commission (IPC) has been constituted as a registered society in December
  2004 and as an autonomous body under MOHFW in 2008. The latest edition of Indian
  Pharmacopeia was published in 2007. Its addenda has been just published in December 2008.
  New reference standards have been prepared and disseminated to industry and regulatory
  agencies and their labs.

· The project catalyzed commissioning of National Pharmaco-Vigilance (NPV) Program, in
  November 2004. Under this program, a network of reporting centers supported by zonal centers
  and a national coordination unit located at the All India Institute of Medial Sciences has been
  established. Two drugs (Rofecoxib and Valdecoxib) have been banned by the GOI based on the
  recommendations of the NPV Advisory Committee (NPAC). NPAC's recommendations have led
  to printing of warning in the labels of Gatifloxacin containing medicines (oral and injectible).

· HACCP standards have been developed for the five core food sectors viz. dairy, meat & poultry,
  fruits & vegetables, hospitality sector & bakery products and harmonized with international
  Codex standards. Industry Associations have been roped in for dissemination of these standards.

· 13 food labs and 4 drug labs were newly built; 15 food labs and 9 drug labs were upgraded /
  renovated through civil works and/or procurement of lab equipment and instruments in the state
  and central sectors taken together. A total of 1865 equipments have been installed out of the 1921
  equipments delivered under the project.

· Training in drug safety and quality was given to 2605 public and private sector personnel out of
  the planned 2625. The training curriculum was updated with more hands-on training. The training
  led to increase of knowledge and skills about GMP, Standard Operating Procedures (SOP),
  process verification and appropriate documentation.

· A total of 1630 people from the food sector were trained, including 473 food inspectors and 48
  public analysts.

· Substantial achievements were made in public education on food and drug safety related issues. A
 mass media communication campaign was run around themes of personal hygiene, safe food and
 rational use of prescription drugs. Its actual coverage exceeded the target.




                                               39

    · Street Food Survey run through 18 Home Science Colleges was carried out to pilot tools
        proposed for changing the behavior of the food vendors. Training of street food vendors on safety
        and hygiene, food courts etc. were some of the innovations introduced by the Project.

    · The Consumer Awareness Task Force was another bold attempt to provide community education
        on the above mentioned themes through NGO networks.

    · The food laboratories across the country have been computerized and networked for online
        monitoring of their functions. About 90,000 past records have been digitized and stored in the
        database of the system.

    · Both the Central Food and Drug regulators were shifted to a state of the art and independent
        building built under this Project. This not only provided a more congenial environment for their
        working but also bestowed upon them a distinct identity of their own.

5. Shortfall in the Achievement of Project Objectives

The project has made substantial gains not only in the policy & institutional development arena but also
by way of building awareness among consumers, building human resources both in the government and
the private sector and creating additional laboratory capacity. However, there have been some shortfalls
particularly on the human resources and laboratory development area. Some of the more significant
shortfalls are as mentioned below.

    · Out of 58 number of civil works proposed at the time of the PIP, 49 works were pursued.
        However, only 37 numbers of civil works could be taken up. 2 works were halted midway and
        handed over to the state governments on as is where is basis. 12 works could not be started
        because of delay in finalizing site.

    · About 1950 equipments were procured out of 3374 planned. Although procurement preparations
        had been made for the fourth year, because of the differences in perception of findings of DIR,
        further procurement was not made. The emphasis thereafter was on operationalization of those
        already installed. About 1865 could be operationalized by the end of the project. Some of the
        remaining ones were defective, though the specifications were settled with the recommendation
        of WHO and experts and vetted by the Bank.

    · In the food sector, 69 training programmes were organized and 1630 persons were imparted
        training including people from industry and consumer organizations, against targeted 249 training
        courses and 8022 personnel. The shortfall was due to lack of success in recruitment of training
        agencies and delayed start of the programs.


The above shortfalls notwithstanding, the project was largely successful in achieving its overall objectives.
The project was first of its kind in the country as also in the World Bank. The project operated across
multiple dimensions viz. multi-sectoral, multiple target groups, diverse outcomes, states with varying
capacity & motivation for a comprehensive development of capacity in the two sectors critical to nation's
health and economy. It contributed significantly to the strengthening of policies and regulatory capacity in
the food and drug sector harmonizing them with internationally accepted norms and practices. It also
forged a powerful network of human resource development institutions for public and professional
education and training with significantly revamped curricula and methods. The dialogue unleashed by the
Project has brought greater visibility to the two sectors, bringing in more resources and commitment from



                                                     40

stakeholders. The Center and some larger States with prior capacity and major presence of pharmaceutical
industry having international operations derived greater benefits from the project than smaller States with
little presence of drug industry. These large States are dominant in terms of the share of their industry of
the total Indian market and corresponding regulatory activity. For example, Gujarat and Maharashtra
together perform more than 25% of all tests done by State drug quality control labs in India. The labs of
these two States were the best performers under the project, achieved National Accreditation Board for
Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) certification and showed a marked increase in output due to
the investments made by the project. The challenge for the sector is to consolidate the achievements in
the weaker states and sustain the reform agenda, dialogue and political visibility to the sector, while
continuing with human resource development and consumer awareness and participation activities.


6. Project Cost & Expenditure

The total cost of the project was US $ 72.92 out of which US$ 18.89 was to come from the Government
of India. The remaining i.e. US $ 54.03 was earmarked for the World Bank. Out of the available credit, a
sum of 27.71 million USD was availed of. The short fall is largely on account of shortfall in targets of
procurement of equipment and civil works, the reasons whereof have been explained in the previous
section. The weakness of project management structure, lack of commitment and involvement on part of
some of the states, complex procurement arrangements set in under the project and varying perceptions of
DIR findings are the main factors behind the partial utilization of the project credit.


7. Bank's Performance

The World Bank selected a very important sector having major impact on health that was hitherto missing
from the agenda of partner agencies. The reform of regulatory environment had both domestic and
international impact and was chosen at a time, when private participation of the market in the health
system was deepening, and country's pharma industry was on a high growth trajectory. Thus, the
assistance was both timely and appropriate. Even though, it was the first program of such kind in the
Bank's lending history anywhere in the world, the Bank showed courage in underwriting a program of
such sweep. To this extent, the World Bank needs to be commended.

In terms of design of the Project, in hindsight it appears that readiness of all the states to undertake the
reform or take similar project activities was assumed. It is felt that if the scope of the project were limited
to states which had better regulatory set-up; higher concentration of pharma industry and more ownership
and interest in the program, the achievement would have been better. Later, these champions could have
served as role models for other states. Other issue in design was the structure of Project Coordination Unit,
which was staffed entirely from consultant. Their high turnover and low clout within the system limited
the project impact. If it were staffed partially from MOHFW staff/deputationists, the continuity in the
project would have been better. The recruitment of analysts and inspectors also could have been looked
into. The procurement processes agreed upon at the time of design/appraisal proved time consuming and
had to be simplified later. Although these design flaws hampered the achievement of project outcomes, its
conceptualization and design was able to secure a major legislative and institutional reform and capacity
building of the twin sectors.

The supervision of the Bank during the entire project period was an ongoing process rather than episodic.
It actively participated in the Ministry's meetings and reviews and regularly followed up on the progress.
It also partnered its efforts with collaborating agencies such as WHO as well as the private sector,
academic institutions and consumer activists and NGOs. It took active interest in the conduct of the
studies, surveys; analysis of the findings and their dissemination to different stakeholders. The Bank also


                                                     41

was quick to learn from the implementation experience and agree to modification of the implementation
framework e.g. it suggested appointment of a fulltime Project Coordinator, agreed to a reduction in
number of stages of scrutiny of the tenders from 3 to 2 & proposed constitution of Empowered
Procurement Wing in the MOHFW.

Bank provided good support in the area of procurement and financial management. The PCU staff was
apprised about the rules and procedure for procurement of goods, works and consultants and requirement
of financial management. Audit reports were reviewed and commented upon in a timely manner.

The DIR team conducted a detailed review of the implementation and unfortunately came up with
sweeping findings. It examined the project laboratory and office equipment contracts procured by the
PSA through ICB and NCB procedures. The DIR team raised suspicion of interference, fraud and
corruption about procurement activities in contracts representing 87 percent of the number of pieces
and 88 percent of the total value of equipment procured. The MOHFW did a comprehensive review of
the DIR report and the sent its response including proposed actions on specific issues. Briefly, it rebutted
the suggestion of large scale irregularity and pointed out that an elaborate process had been gone through
including review by the World Bank in arriving at such decisions. The perception of the two partners as to
the transparency of the procurement actions led to cancellation of 4th year's procurement and ultimately
affected the project's credit utilization. A more sober approach might have helped the cause of project
better. It would have been better and would have resulted in more accurate findings, had the MOHFW
been consulted before finalizing the report/comments of the DIR.


8. Sustainability

The gains made by the projects are likely to be sustainable, as the project has given impetus to institution
building such as autonomous Central Food Standard and Safety Authority, proposed Central Drug
Standard and Control Authority, Indian Pharamcoepia Commission, Consumer Task Force; setting up of
programmes such Pharmaco-vigilance programme, training programs under institutions such as NIPER,
CFTRI, Mysore etc. Further, capacity developed in private and academic sector and among NGOs serves
as a foundation for future programs, and systems and tools created can be shared widely.

The country's obligation to public health programs arising out of National Health Policy and other related
policies and legislations, international covenants and treaties as also the imperatives of large
pharmaceutical exports of APIs and generic drugs will continue to lend focus and funding to reform of
regulatory environment especially of drugs. In addition, partners and donors such WHO, Health Canada,
USFDA etc. have entered into or are initiating partnership programs with the central and some state
regulatory agencies. NABL accreditation processes are gaining momentum and would highlight the
weaknesses of laboratories, which are likely to generate further push to improvement of laboratories.
Thus funding and political support for the sectors will be sustained at least initially at the central level and
in the states that made use of the project initiatives to reform and upgrade their set-up and integrated with
their own programs.

Lack of commitment in weaker States is unlikely to retard overall development outcomes in context of
above powerful forces, although it will surely delay up-gradation of their regulatory set-up. New
legislation that is currently under preparation would transfer some critical functions from States to the
Center, which would result in uniform national standards for the control and enforcement of
manufacturing standards.

Thus, the project gains are likely to be sustainable.



                                                       42

9. Future Support Needed from the Bank

As was indicated in the discussions on the issue of sustainability that the project gains are likely to be
sustainable on a long term over the entire country and initially at least in the center and states that made
efficient use of the project assistance. Two principle factors are at work i.e. the institutional development
& restructuring and pressure from public health groups& related stakeholders. In fact, the lack of latter is
largely responsible for lukewarm achievements. Thus, it is advocacy with the decision makers and
stakeholders that is needed to spread the gains of reform and restructuring of the sector to weaker states.
Only then, investments for development of labs or human resource development would be productive.
Advocacy efforts would be financed by the Government of India. Some states that are at intermediate
level of capacity and commitment in these sectors will need support. As many of the development
partners are working or propose to work at the state level, their investment needs will be largely taken
care of by the partners, supplemented by the GOI. As far as funding for sustaining the important
initiatives of the Project viz. Pharmaco-vigilance programme, training of regulatory and laboratory
personnel, IPC, street food initiative, consumer taskforce and strengthening of laboratories etc. is
concerned, domestic funding will be mobilized either in shape of a centrally sponsored programme, which
links reforms of these sectors to funding or this could also become part of state's own initiatives to
revamp the public health systems.

The regulatory standards and methods are constantly evolving in light of new technological developments
and experiences gained by different nations and international bodies, especially in the pharmaceutical
sector. These developments add to the existing regulatory gap vis-à-vis advanced regulatory regimes.
Thus, the program of reform and improvement in the sector is likely to continue. Furthermore, due to the
regulatory weakness and capacity deficit in the weaker states, handholding will also be needed even
though investment may be coming out of states' or GOI own budget. It is in this backdrop that the need
for technical assistance by the Bank will be desirable. The same was suggested in the wrap-up meeting
with the Bank's Implementation Completion Mission on 23.09.08.


10. Lessons Learned

Implementing Agency:

     · It is critical to ensure a structure for the implementing agency that imparts both strength and
         institutional memory. For this purpose, the project management unit must have a minimum
         number of personnel drawn from the government, which would have given this unit stability. The
         capacity gaps should have been met with consultants. Furthermore, arrangement should have
         been worked out for more stability in the senior management of the project, if necessary by
         making their tenure coterminous with the Project.

     · It is important to assess the commitment and ownership as also the state of the sector within the
         purview of implementing agency(ies) before undertaking a complex reform project. The activities
         should be calibrated accordingly, e.g. for a state with few pharmaceutical industries and lack of
         champions for reform of the sectors, it would have been wise to concentrate upon advocacy
         activities such as workshops, press reports, studies etc. The trigger for hardware development
         should have been triggered by willingness to reform judged on a variety of parameters.




                                                     43

Project Design

   · Prior to launching the project, the issue of recruitment should have been investigated and
       addressed in order to avoid the staffing problems encountered during implementation.

   · The project design must ensure that the capacity building issue is addressed in a comprehensive
       manner. If labs are built, equipped and staffed for increasing the testing capacity, the sampling
       and enforcing capacity of the agency must also be enhanced.

Procurement activities other than for civil work:

   · Better contractual provisions with incentives and disincentives need to be included in supply
       agreements. Disincentive for non-performance of service obligations should be such that raise its
       cost to an extent that could finance alternate service.

   · It is important to map the process flow of procurement operations & consider the necessity of
       different steps of the process. By eliminating redundant processes or by redesigning the flow, the
       process should be streamlined.

   · In place of purchase of expensive equipments, options such as leasing or in-sourcing should be
       explored. The incentive for better service by the manufacturer/supplier throughout the entire
       lifetime of the equipment is higher if the payments are staggered in annual installments linked to
       a defined service level rather than being made upfront.

   · The involvement of labs is important right from the beginning of procurement process e.g. in
       finalization of number and specification of equipments. The procurement must be aligned with
       the desired output (both type and volume) of tests.

Fund Flow Mechanisms:

   · If indirect channels of fund flow are to be used, it is necessary to establish convergence in
       understanding of processes, expectations, and norms and to create necessary linkages for efficient
       fund flow.

Operationalization of new equipment:

   · Supply of equipment, its installation, commissioning and application training need to be
       synchronized and closely supervised for making full and prompt use of of the specialized
       equipment. If necessary, the training institutions should work out application training modules in
       concert with manufacturers, the liability whereof should be built in the supply order issued to
       manufacturer/supplier.
Training:

   · The training imparted to the analysts and inspectors must have greater practical orientation. This
       could be provided by the better functioning central and state labs e.g. of Maharashtra and Gujarat.
       Exposure visits of analysts, inspectors as well as drug controllers should be organized to better
       regulated states viz. Maharashtra, Gujarat and also to the state of the art laboratories of the private
       sector.




                                                    44

Scope of regulatory development projects

    · In a federal scenario it is also important to develop networks of communication not only with the
       central regulators but also among the state level regulators, not only for cross-learning but also for
       prompt notification of incidents of spurious and sub-standard drugs, adverse drug reactions etc.
       for action by other regulators too. It must be also included as a project activity.

    · Minimum acceptable standards must be laid down for implementation of the food and drug laws
       in the States. A national working group could be formed to agree on common standards and
       advice provided to the State governments. Thereafter, sufficient political visibility and dialogue is
       necessary to ensure its implementation.
