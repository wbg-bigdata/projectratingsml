REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO MALAYSIA FOR THE JOHORE LAND SETTLE-
MENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Malaysia for the equivalent of US$40.0 million to help finance the
Johore Land Settlement Project. The loan would have a term of 23 years,
including 8 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum. The
proceeds of the loan would be relent to the Federal Land Development Authority
(FELDA) on the same terms and conditions.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report (No. 217-MA) was circulated to the
Executive Directors in August, 1973 (R73-208). An annual economic mission
is currently in Malaysia. Its report will be distributed in due course.
Country data for Malaysia are included in Annex I.
3.        With a per capita GNP of around US$400 (1971), Malaysia is one
of the most piosperous developing countries in Southeast Asia. The
Malaysian economy has also maintained fairly high rates of real growth of
GNP, averaging about 6 percent per annum during the last decade, with an
increase to 6.5 percent forecast for the first half of the 1970s. Exports,
which account for over 40 percent of GNP, have been growing 4 to 5 percent.
per year. The country's balance of payments position is sound. There are
few foreign exchange controls, and external reserves are equal to eight
months' imports.
4.        In the last few years, even though the export dependence of the
economy has not decreased substantially, Malaysia has significantly diver-
sified its exports. Whereas in 1961 nearly 50 percent of merchandise export
earnings was derived from rubber, in the last few years less than one-third
originated from this source. Timber and palm oil exports have risen
dramatically, in 1972 representing 25 percent of exports. In the future,
exports of petroleum and gas are expected to play an increasingly important
role.
5.        Agriculture has accounted for about 30 percent of the country's
GDP and about 50 percent of employment, but the manufacturing sector is
making an increasingly important contribution. During the Second Malaysia
Plan (SMP) period (1971-75), agricultural growth is expected to average
8.3 percent, while the projected growth rate for the manufacturing sector
is 14 percent. The manufacturing sector now accounts for 15 percent of GDP,
about 22 percent of merchandise exports, and employs 10 percent of the
working population.
6.        Although Malaysia has achieved satisfactory rates of growth of
production, the terms of trade, which during the 1960s declined by 20
percent, reduced real income growth from 6 to about 4.5 percent per annum,



-2-
resulting in a less than 2 percent increase in per capita income. From
1971 to 1973 the increase in real purchasing power was 5.5 percent per annum.
Consequently, real per capita income is estimated to have grown during this
period by 2.8 percent a year.
7.        Population growth rates will remain high for some time around
2.7 percent per annum, accompanied by a growth in the labor force of about
3.3 percent per annum, but Malaysia's physical resources and employment
potential are great. During the Second Malaysia Plan, the country
projects an average annual increase in employment of 3.4 percent accompanied
by a reduction in underemployment. In the longer term, over the next two
decades, Malaysia expects to reduce the unemployment rate from 7.5 to 4
percent. During this period, in Peninsular Malaysia, the agricultural share
of the labor force is expected to drop by almost 20 percent, to 33 percent,
and the employment share in manufacturing is expected to more than double,
rising to 24 percent.
8.        Since the racial disturbances of May, 1969, Malaysia's political
structure has been stable and the ruling position of the Alliance Party
virtually unchallenged. The ethnic issues highlighted in 1969 center on the
economic disparity between the Malays, who account for a little over half
of the population, and non-Malays, who are predominantly Chinese. The
Government addresses the problem in the New Economic Policy which over the
next 20 years aims to eradicate poverty and to restructure society so that
the present identification of race with a particular form of economic
activity will eventually be eliminated. The basic outlines of the Policy
are sound and allow for continued growth for the principal ethnic groups
while at the same time accelerating Malay economic opportunities. The
SIP seeks continued rapid growth as necessary to support these two
objectives.
9.        The SMP also reflects the Government's option in favor of a more
vigorous role for the public sector in the country's development efforts.
The revised Plan proposes an allocation of US$4 billion, twice the level
of total public development expenditures under the First Plan. The public
sector's planning and implementation capacity has been substantially expanded
although several planning and operating agencies still suffer from substantial
manpower shortages. The Government's capacity to prepare and execute
projects resulted in expenditures during the first three years of the Plan
period that were already two-thirds of the original plan allocation. The
revised Plan levels anticipate a further strengthening of project identifi-
cation and implementation in the public sector. Most of the increased
allocation is earmarked to support the New Economic Policy, including among
other items (a) the expansion of the land settlement programs to provide
employment opportunities, (b) increased support to the manufacturing sector
to diversify the economy and to provide increased employment in higher
income jobs; and (c) the provision of training and education to upgrade
the job opportunities of the low-income groups.



-3-
10.       With adequate external assistance, the financing of the large
increase in the Government's development expenditures appears feasible.
Government revenues are satisfactory (federal revenues accounted for about
22 percent of GNP in 1971), and the Government can readily borrow substantial
domestic resources, particularly from the Employees' Provident Fund. In
the past, the Bank has provided slightly less than 40 percent of the public
sector's external borrowing, 36 percent or USS145 million on a commitment
basis during the first three years of the Plan. Bilateral aid--mainly
from the United Kingdom, other Commonwealth countries, and Germany--
and loans from the Asian Develonment Bank provided the rest. Japan is
exnected to become the largest bilateral donor. ADB is expected to continue
expanding its lending, and Bank lending is projected to increase in line
with Malaysia's total external borrowing. Disbursed Bank loans outstanding
at the end of 1972 amounted to about 10 percent of Malaysia's total out-
standing and disbursed external debt, and by the end of 1978 will amount
to about 35 percent. The estimated requirements of loan caDital inflow
are well within Malaysia's debt-carrying canacity. Debt service obligations
at Present are about 4.5 percent of exDorts of goods and non-factor
services and are estimated not to exceed 8 percent durine the late 197ns.
The current Bank share in Malaysia's debt service payments is 22 percent
and is expected to increase to about 25 percent by the end of 1978.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAYSIA
11.       The Bank has made 23 loans to Malaysia for projects in education,
ponulation, agriculture, forestry, industrial finance, power, water supply,
telecommunications, ports, railways, roads and urban transport. Although
in a few cases disbursements were slow, the execution of these projects
has generallv been satisfactory. As of November 30, 1973 the loans to
Malaysia held by the Bank amounted to US$351.7 million. In addition, the
Bank made a loan in 1965 to the Public Utilities Board, Singapore
(Loan 405-MA), guaranteed by Malaysia, to finance the Johore River Project.
The amount held bv the Bank under that loan is US$5.3 million.     Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of
November 30, 1973 and notes on the execution of on-going projects.
12.       Bank assistance to Malaysia is intended to support the
Government's efforts within the framework of the New Economic Policy to
redress imbalances in rural and urban incomes, to create employment for
the urban unemploved, and to reduce rural underemployment. Since Malaysia's
land development and rural development programs provide the most effective
Covernment instrument for tackling the issues of unemployment and income
imlalance, the Bank will continue to give financial support to these
programs. So far, the Eank has made three loans for land settlement
projects in the Jengka Triangle area where about 100,000 acres of land
are being developed and abouit 10,000 smallholder families are being settled.
In addition, the Bank will continue to assist Malaysia in the critical



fields of education to increase educational opportunities for the rural
poor and of infrastructure development that will improve conditions in
the urban areas and help support manufacturing. The Bank has helped the
Government to prepare projects either in the course of its lending operations
or by acting as Executing Agency for UNDP-financed studies. The Bank has
also helped strengthen public agencies responsible for carrying out
imnortant parts of Malaysia's investment program. We will continue this
policy which will be reflected in the loans to be presented to the Executive
Directors in the next year or so. These loans would be for projects
involving drainage, land settlement, agricultural credit, agricultural
research, urban infrastructure and education.    In such sectors as education
and agricultuire where the foreign exchange content is typically small,
the Bankc will continue to cover a portion of local costs to assure that
the Bank will be able to participate effectively in the implementation of
a project.
13.       TFC has been active in Malaysia since 1963 and has made five
investments totalling US$8.1 million (Annex II).    The total commitments
under those investments held by IFC as of November 30, 1973 amounted to
USS4.1 million. The Corporation is not considering any new investment
projects in Malaysia at present.
PART III - ACRICULTURE IN MALAYSIA
General
14.       Agriculture, including forestry and fisheries, occupies an
imnortant position in the Malaysian economy. It generates about 30
percent of the countrv's gross domestic product, it provides employment
for nearly 50 percent of the economically active population and it accounts
for about 55 percent of the country's foreign exchange earnings.
15.       Production of rubber and palm oil for export are the most
imnortant agricultural activities. The country is or will shortly become
self-sufficient in rice, sugar, poultry, and pork, but continues to depend
on imports for most of the other foodstuffs and fiber products. Presently,
about 8 million acres are under crops in Peninsular Malaysia and an esti-
mated 6 million acres suitable for agriculture still remain undeveloped.
16.       As a major productive sector, agriculture must continue to
grow if Malaysia is to achieve her objectives of (a) continued growth of
the economy: (b) reduction of unemployment and underemployment; (c) improve-
ment of the income levels of the rural poor; and (d) reduction of regional
income and population disparities. In an attempt to achieve these objectives,
one of the most effective policy instruments used by Malavsia is the devel-
opment of her vast unutilized land resources through settlement schemes.



Land Development and Settlement
17.       Up to about 1930 land development was carried out mainly by
the large private rubber companies. Smallholdings grew at a much slower
pace. From 1930 to the present the growth of private estates slowed while
the area under smallholdings increased more rapidly. Since the early
1960's, the Government has given high priority to new land development and
settlement under programs which are being carried out by the Federal Land
Develonment Authority (FELDA) and by the State Governments. The Government
has also put emphasis on diversifying agricultural output, consolidating
smallholdings into larger and more economic units, and on replanting the
existing holdings through the Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation
Authority (FELCRA) and the Rubber Industry Smallholders' Development
Authority (RISDA).
18.       In recent years major regional development plans have been
prepared, the first of which was prepared with Bank assistance for the
Jengka Triangle in the State of Pahang. Since then, with assistance from
the United Kingdom, the Government has prepared a regional development
program for Southeast Johore (Johore Tenggara) where the proposed project
is located. A further regional develoDment program involving areas in
southeastern ?Thang has been prepared with Canadian assistance. The last
two plans follow a comprehensive regional apnroach to development.
In addition to land settlement and agricultural development, these plans
make provisions for new townships as potential growth centers and establish-
ment of some secondary and tertiarv industries including tourism -- all
creating additional income and employment opportunities and contributir.g
to a good regional balance.
The Johore Teng.,ara Reional Master Plan
19.       The Master Plan designed for develonment of the Johore Tenggara
region (almost 750,000 acres) was completed in 1971. This region was
given Priority for large-scale apricultural develonment because of the
overall quality of its resources and its relatively easy access and
close proximity to existing developed lands in South Johore. The Master
Plan provides for: (a) the clearing of 281,000 acres of forest and the
development of 250,000 (net) acres of oil palm, rubber and other agricul-
tural crops, including 5,000 acres of dairy and beef industry schemes, giving
employment to about 14,000 families; (b) the establishment of an integrated
logging and timber processing complex based on 92,000 acres of rain forest;
(c) the creation of a tourist complex in an area of scenically attractive
coastline which may be handling 50,000 overnight visitors at full development
and providing direct empnloyment to 20,000 persons; and (d1) the conservation
under forest of all land with an average slope greater than 200 and other
land with soils unsuitable for agriculture, together with reservoir catchments
needed to ensure regularity of water supplies, and the establishment of
several nature reserves for preservation of distinct biological communities
of special scientific or aesthetic interest.



20.       The proposed project is a part of the Johore Tenggara Regional
Development Plan and was prepared by the Federal Land Development Authority
(FELDA). The project was appraised in September 1972. Loan negotiations
were held in December 1973 with a delegation led by Raja Alias bin Mohd. Ali,
Director-General, Federal Land Development Authority. A loan and project
summary is included in Annex III. The Appraisal Report No. 265a-MA dated
January 11, 1974 is being circulated separately.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
21.       The proposed project consists of (a) clearing of 81,000 acres of
land and planting about 65,000 acres of oil palms; (b) construction of five
palm oil mills; (c) construction of eight villages, including settler
housing, offices and public buildings such as schools and medical facilities;
(d) construction of roads and provisions for power and water; and (e) settle-
ment of 4,400 families. Each settler would be provided with 14 acres of
planted oil palms, a quarter acre house lot and a house with piped water.
The project would be divided into 16 schemes and the eight villages serving
these schemes would vary in size from 265 to 1,255 settler families. The
larger villages would be constructed with a view to potentially becoming
the nuclei of future urban growth centers and providing an alternative to
those persons who would otherwise, in search of better income opportunities,
wish to migrate to other larger urban centers of Peninsular Malaysia.
Implementation
22.       While the overall responsibility for the execution of the Johore
Tenggara Regional Development Plan will rest in the Johore Tenggara
Development Authority (a joint State and Central Government statutory
authority), the Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA) would be
responsible for carrying out the land development and settlement part of
the proposed project.
23.       FELDA, a government-owned corporation under the Ministry of
National and Rural Development, has a wide range of autonomy in its
operations and is the main Government agency responsible for implementing
Government's settlement policies. FELDA was created in 1956 and since
the early 1960's its operations have steadily expanded. By the end of
1972 it had developed about 430,000 acres and settled some 26,000 families.
During the Second Malaysia Plan (1971-1975) FELDA is expected to develop
over 400,000 acres.
24.       FELDA's administrative costs are met by government grants.    So far,
about 90% of development costs were financed by government loans, the balance
through three IBRD loans for the Jengka Triangle Projects and an ADB loan.
The spread between the overall terms of FELDA's borrowings and its terms of
cost recovery from settlers is sufficient to generate working capital and
reserve for contingencies.



-7-
25.       As a result of a study by management consultants during 1971/72,
FELDA's field administration has been decentralized and headquarters manage-
ment has been strengthened and reorganized. Also, the computerization of
accounting and financial control systems was initiated and, after initial
difficulties, is now operating satisfactorily.
26.       In executing the project, marketable timber in the area would be
extracted prior to the land clearing which would be done one year in
advance of planting. Clearing, planting of oil palms and initial upkeep
for up to 18 months after planting would be carried out by private
contractors, using mostly manual labor, supervised by FELDA staff. Settlers,
who would arrive 18 months after planting, would continue the upkeep under
FELDA supervision. Prior to their arrival, village sites would be cleared
and housing, offices, shops, workshops, and other structures would be built
by contractors employed by FELDA. The appropriate departments of Government
would provide water supply to each village and construct and operate
the educational, health and other communal facilities. Roads would be
built by a regional branch of the Federal Public Works Department (PWD) and
maintained by the State PWD. Standards of both are considered adequate.
The five palm oil mills included in the project would be owned and
managed by FFT,DA.
Cost and Financing of Project
27.       Project costs during the development period from 1972 through
1981 are estimated at US$89.8 million with a foreign exchange component of
about US$22 million equivalent or about 24 percent of project costs. These
estimates include contingencies of US$17.9 million. The proposed Bank loan
of US$40.0 million would meet about US$17.0 million, including contingencies,
of the foreign exchange cost and part of the local currency cost of the
project. As in the case of three previous Bank loans for Jengka Triangle
Projects, the proposed loan would be made to the Government to be on-lent
to FELDA under the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan. Remaining
project costs of US$49.8 million, including the remaining foreign exchange
of US$5.0 million for public buildings and management, would be met by:
(a) Government loans to FELDA of US$29.5 million; (b) direct Government
expenditure of US$11.9 million for roads, water supply and public buildings;
and (c) Government grants to FELDA of US$8.4 million for administration.
28.       Each settler would be indebted to FELDA for agricultural develop-
ment costs (including wages paid to the settler during the development
period) and housing. Loans to settlers would be at 6-1/4 percent per annum
and repayable over 21 years including 6 years of grace for the development
period, during which interest would be capitalized. Investment in factory
construction and equipment would be recovered by a processing fee which is
sufficient to cover factory costs and generate a reasonable return on
investment. Management costs, which are similar to extension services,
would be recovered by a levy raised when settlers' income exceeds the
target of M$ 3,600 (US$1,550) per year. At present prices, management
costs are fully recovered. The elements of subsidy in this project (the



- 8 -
slightly lower interest cost to settlers than commercial rates and the
possibility that management costs will not be fully recovered at lower than
present prices) are consistent with Government income policy in the small-
holder sector and necessary to offer satisfactory incentives for settlers
to contribute their labor to the task of opening up new land. The cost of
settlement per family, excluding social costs (roads, water supply and
nublic huildings), would be IJS$14,100 net of contingencies. This cost is
well justified by the need to generate income commensurate with government
targets in the smallholder sector, and is considerably less than the average
investment per job created in the industrial sector. Furthermore, lower
cost land settlement schemes in the past have been less successful due to
lack of sufficient incentives to settlers.
Procurement and Disbursement
29.       Contracts with an estimated value of USS31.5 million net of
contingencies would be let under international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank Guidelines. These would include land clearing and
planting (US$11.2 million), houses and office buildings (US$5.4 million),
ungrading of roads and culverts (US$2.7 million), palm oil mill machinery
and construction (US$11.5 million), and vehicles and equipment (US$0.7
million). Since sufficient contractor capacity specializing in clearing,
planting and construction is available in Malaysia. all of these contracts
are likely to be awarded to local contractors as in the Jengka projects.
A range of goods required for the project, such as palm oil mill components
and vehicles, is manufactured in Malaysia; local manufacturers would be
allowed a margin of preference of 15 percent, or the actual customs duty,
whichever is lower.
30.       As in the Jengka Projects, fertilizers and pesticides (U!S$10.7
million), would be procured through local competitive bidding. Several
international producers are represented in Malaysia, and FFLDA has established
an effective fertilizer and pesticides supply system which services its
entire land settlement program. It wJould, therefore, not be practical or
economical to establish a separate supnly system for the proposed project.
Road construction, water supply systems and Public buildings (USS1O.O
million), to be financed by the Government, would be constructed by PWI).
31.       The remaining costs of USS.A11.7 million are direct FFLTDA
expenditures such as salaries, settlers' wages during the development
period and Planting material and as such are not Eii table for competitive
bidding.
32.       Disbursements would be made (a) against 90 percent of the total costs
of felling, land clearing and planting, upgrading agricultural roads, housing
and house lot development and palm oil mill construction and machinery; and
(h) against the foreign exchange cost of imported fertilizers, pesticides,
vehicles and capital equipment or against ex-factory price of these items if
manutfactured locallv and 70 percent of total expenditures if they are



imported but procured locally. Since felling and land clearing are subject
to climatic conditions, some contracts have been let since August 1, 1973
in order not to hold un the project. The value of such advance contracts
does not exceed US$2.5 million. Disbursement against such contracts would
be for expenditures incurred after the date of loan signing.
Benefits and Justification
33.       The proposed project forms a vital part of the develonment strategy
for the Johore Tenggara region. It would support Government plans to achieve
high rates of growth in snallholder agriculture through land development and
settlement thereby reducing unemplovment and underemnloyment and increasing
incomes of the rural population. At peak production (1985) yearly sales
ex mill are estimated at US$24 million. Industrial development will be
induced through the construction of oil palm mills and storage facilities
which will generate increased local manufacture of mill and storage equipment.
Settlers' average yearly incomes would rise from about USS375 before they
join the scheme to USS1,600 after they finish loan repayments.
34.       The project will contribute to the establishment of a number of
urban growth centers.   These centers will help redirect urban migration from
a few larae cities to medium-sized towns. They will bring additional long-
term employment opportunities to settlers and their dependents. About 10,200
persons would find permanent employment through the project; 4,900 would be
directly employed on the schemes, while some 5,300 persons would fill the
additional jobs induced in the villages and in other nearby urban centers.
A total popuilation of about 30,000 persons would be supnorted by these jobs.
In addition roughly 6,000 workers would be directlv employed during the
development period.
35.       The economic rate of return, at the estimated conservative price
of UTS$197 per ton cif Europe of palm oil, is about 15 percent. If prices
increase to about US$220 per ton, which is a reasonable possibility, the
rate of return of the project will be about 17 percent.
36.       Except for the part obtained by the Government, most of the benefits
of the project accrue to settlers whose present and expected future incomes
are well below average Malaysian incomes. The distributional impact of the
project is therefore clearly favorable.
37.       Due consideration has been given to the ecological aspects of
the project.  The project provides adequate safeguards against erosion,
siltation and excessive flooding. It also provides for conservation and
protection of forests for strict nature reserves, including a sanctuary
for wildlife, and for recreational-cum-tourism purposes. The adverse effects
of pollution from effluents will be minimized by locating the processing
factories away from residential areas and in proximity with adequate water
supplies.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 533   Jengka Triangle Project; US$14.0 Million Loan of
April 17, 1968; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Loan No. 672   Second Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project; US$13.0
Million Loan of May 20, 1970; Closing Date: May 31, 1977
Loan No. 885   Third Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project; US$25.0
Million Loan of March 30, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The projects consist of the clearing of forest, the planting of 62,000
acres of oil palms and 35,000 acres of rubber and the settlement of 10,000
families in the Jengka Triangle (State of Pahang). The Federal Land Develop-
ment Authority (FELDA), responsible for the execution of the project, operates
efficiently and its standard of planting and maintenance is high. The first
project (533-MA) has been completed. Cost overruns are estimated to have
been about US$5 million or 20 percent of appraisal cost estimates, of which
about US$3 million is due to the US$ devaluation. The Second Jengka Project
(672-MA) is alOo mostly completed. But, due to timber shortages, the
housing program is somewhat behind schedule. Cost overruns are estimated
at about US$3.5 million or 10 percent of appraisal cost estimates, of which
about US$3 million is due to the US dollar devaluation. The Third Jengka
project is proceeding satisfactorily and is somewhat ahead of schedule.
Loan No. 673   Jengka Forestry Project; US$8.5 Million Loan of May 20,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1974
Implementation of the project, consisting of a highly complex
integrated forestry products industry established in the Jengka Triangle,
suffered because of management and technical problems, which were both traced
to the lack of previous experience of this kind in Malaysia. However,
corrective steps were taken and performance, both managerial and financial,
has been satisfactory during the past 12 months.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 579   Fourth Power Project; US$8.5 Million Loan of
JaIuarv 9  1969, Closing Date:   March 31, 1974
Loan No. 700   Fifth Power Project; US$20.0 Million Loan of
July 16, 1970; Closing Date: January 31, 1975
Implementation of the projects consisting of extensions to
existing thermal plants of the National Electricity Board system is behind
schedule, because of manufacturers' delays, particularly in supplying
structural steels and turbo-alternators.
Loan No. 753   Second Telecormunications Project- US$18.7 Millioni Loan
of June 21, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The project includes facilities and equipment to improve the
domestic and international telecommunications systems. Implementation has
been slightly delayed but there are reasonable prospects that the
project will be completed on schedule. About 70 percent of the loan is
already conmmitted, but due to delays in deliveries and internal administrative
problems of the Telecommunications Department of Malaysia (TDM), no disburse-
ments were made as of November 30, 1973. Disbursements have now begun and
are expected to accelerate in the course of the year. A Bank Supervision
Mission is scheduled to go to Malaysia in. late February to assist TDM in
expediting the procurement and disbursement process.
Loan No. 561   Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Project; US$3.6 Million Loan
of September 27,- 1968; Closing Date: September 1, 1974
Loan No. 908   Second Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Project; US$13.5 Million
Loan of June 14, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The projects consist of the improvement and expansion of water
supply facilities in the Kuala Lumpur area. Implementation of the first
project had been delayed because the main civil works contract had to
be retendered following the death of the main contractor and the liquidation
of his firm.  Costs are within the original estimates and work has been
completed. However, the Closing Date had to be postponed for a second time
to September 1, 1974 to allow for the payment of retention monies. The
original Closing Date was September 1, 1972. Tenders for certain parts
of the second project have been awarded and site investigations for the
proposed dam are in progress.
Loan No. 599   Education Pr2iect__US$8.8 Million Loan of
May 21 1969j Closing Date: December 31, 1974
The project will provide in 21 new schools about 11,000 student
places, of which about 2,500 will be in Sabah and Sarawak for secondary
education and teachers training and about 8,500, mainly in Peninsular
Malaysia for vocational, technical and agricultural education. Project
implementation generally is about six months behind schedule, due to some
siting problems and to staff shortages in the Public Works Department which



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 6 pages
delayed preparatory design processes, but is now progressing well. All
but one of the 21 project institutions should be completed by end 1974.
A start on the construction of the remaining project item, one of the
three agricultural schools in Peninsular Malaysia, was considerably delayed
by difficulties in obtaining a suitable site. Although the site is
now acquired and construction has already begun, the Closing Date will
require postponement. Total project costs seem likely to be substantially
lower than originally estimated and about US$1.0 million may remain
uncommitted.
Loan No. 810   Second Education Project; US$15.5 Million Loan of
April 5, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Under this project the expansion of technical and vocational
education in Malaysia, started under the first project, will be continued
by the construction of 8 schools, providing 4,700 student places, and by
the establishment at the University of Penang of science schools providing
about 2,600 student places.   The project includes also the establishment
of an educational center which will provide a curricula improvement course
for teachers and the provision of educational television which is expected
to serve some 500,000 primary and secondary students. Progress is
generally satisfactory and overall project costs are expected to fall
within original estimates.
Loan No. 774   Sabah Ports Project; US$16.1 Million Loan of
June 30, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
The project consists of the construction of new ports at Kota
Kinabalu and Sandakan in the State of Sabah. All civil works contracts
have been awarded but construction has been behind schedule by about
three to four months due to mobilization delays caused by the seamen's
strike in Japan and the staffing difficulties arising as a result of the
project manager's death.
Loan No. 799   Railway Project; US$16.0 Million Loan of
February 11, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
The project includes mainly equipment and works for a dieselization
program of the Malayan Railways (MR). Implementation is behind schedule
by about one year because of the Railways' management problems and its
initial unfamiliarity with the Bank's procurement procedures. A recent
supervision mission has proposed that MR hire consultants to help MR in
improving its management weaknesses.
Loan No. 851   Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project; US$16.0 Million
Loan of July 20, 1972; Closing Date: April 30, 1977
The project is designed to improve access to Kuala Lumpur
from the adjacent town of Petaling Jaya. The main civil works contract
has been awarded.



ANNEX II
Page 6 of 6 pages
Loan No. 880   Population Project; US$5.0 Million Loan of February 9,
1973; Closing Date:   September 30, 1978
The project is designed to assist Malaysia in achieving low
birth and population growth rates and thus to contribute to an increase
in per capita income growth and in the long run to ease the unemployment
problem. The United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) is
providing US$4.3 million in the form of a grant to finance certain components
of the project. Progress is satisfactory after initial difficulties in
coordinating activities of the Government agencies involved, which has delayed
loan disbursement.
Loan No. 931   Second Highway Project; US$19.5 Million
Loan of August 22, 1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1977
The loan for this project, which consists of construction and
improvement of Peninsular Malaysia's main north-south highway and of
various studies, became effective on October 25, 1973. Project implementation
has started and is proceeding satisfactorily.

ANNEX III
Page 3 of 3 pages
Procurement Arrangements:     All items financed under the Bank loan other
than pesticides and fertilizers would be
procured under international competitive
bidding for a total of US$31.5 million excluding
contingencies; local equipment manufacturers
would be allowed a margin of preference of
15 percent or the actual customs duty, whichever
is lower. Fertilizers and pesticides amounting
to US$10.7 million would be procured through
local competitive bidding (foreign companies
well represented). Contracts for land
clearing, awarded after August 1, 1973, would
be eligible for disbursements, but disbursements
would be made only for actual expenditures
incurred after the date of loan agreement;
no retroactive financing will be required.
Pate of Return;               The economic rate of return of the project
is estimated to be between 15 and 17 per-
cent. The project would result in 10,200 add-
itional jobs either directly through settlement
or indirectly through jobs induced in the new
villages and in the nearby urban centers.
The incomes of the settler families are
expected to increase to a level about three
to four times higher than what could be earned
in settlers' previous activities.
