JOHORE LAND SETTLEMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
i.        The project comprises part of a land settlement program in the
Johore Tenggara Region in the southeastern part of Peninsular Malaysia.
New land development is an important instrument of the Government's New
Economic Policy which aims to increase income and employment opportunities
for the unemployed and underemployed. Land development assists the country's
low income groups directly by providing higher income jobs and indirectly by
siphoning away labor from the traditional low income smallholder sector.
Recent development plans have paid particular attention to the need of
providing settlers with a satisfactory range of public services and with
additional non-agricultural employment opportunities. The proposed project,
which is an integral part of the Master Plan for the Johore Tenggara Region,
will help achieve these important objectives. The Plan, including the
feasibility study for the proposed project, was prepared by a group of con-
sulting firms led by Hunting Technical Services Ltd. (UK).
ii.       The project consists of:  (a) clearing 81,000 acres of land;
(b) planting about 65,000 acres of oil palms; (c) construction of housing
for about 4,400 settler families, offices and public buildings, such as
schools and medical facilities; (d) construction of five palm oil mills;
and (e) construction of roads and provision of water. The Federal Land
Development Authority (FELDA) -  a Government agency which has the main
responsibility for land development and settlement in Malaysia -- would
be responsible for project implementation. FELDA is also the executing
agency for three Bank financed Jengka projects (loans 533-IDA, 672 IDA and
BBS MA). About 10,200 persons would find permanent employment through
the project; 4,900 would be directly employed on the oil palm schemes, while
5,`G0 persons would fill the additional jobs induced in villages and nearby
urban centers. A total population of about 30,000 persons would be supported
by these jobs. Annual settler family income would increase from about M$ 870
(US$375) before entering the project to about M$ 3,800 (US$1,600) after some
20 years.
iii.      Total costs of the proposed project are estimated at M$ 209.2 million
(US$89.8 million). FELDA expenditure for agricultural development, housing,
processing facilities, and management are estimated to be US$61.9 million.
Direct Government expenditures for roads, water supply, and public buildings,
such as schools and health centers, would equal US$10.0 million. Contingencies
are estimated to be US$17.9 million. The foreign exchange component is
US$21.8 million, or 24% of project costs. The proposed project would be
financed through: (a) a Bank loan of US$40.0 million; (b) Government loans
to FELDA of US$29.5 million; (c) Government grants to FELDA of US$8.4 million;
and (d) direct Government expenditures of US$11.9 million. Contracts with
an estimated value of US$31.5 million, net of contingencies, would be let
under international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelires.
These contracts would be for land clearing and planting; upgrading of roads;



- ii -
the construction of buildings and palm oil mills; and for mill machinery and         ^
vehicles and equipment. As in the Jengka projects, fertilizers and pesticides W
for US$10.7 million, net of contingencies, would be procured within the
supply system FELDA has established for its entire land settlement program.
The road and water supply components and public buildings of the project,
US$10.0 million, net of contingencies, would be executed by the ?ublic Works
Department on force account. The remaining costs of US$19.7 million, net of
contingencies, are FELDA expenditures for salaries and settlers' wages.
iv.       This would be the seventh agricultural and forestry project financed
by the Bank in Malaysia. Previous land settlement projects include 3 loans
for the Jengka Triangle Program (Loans 533-MA, US$14.0 million; 672-MA
US$13.0 million; and 885-MA US$25.0 million) approved in 1968, 1970 and 1973.
The other projects are: a forestry project (Loan 673-MA, US$8.5 million,
1970) and two irrigation projects - Muda (Loan 434-MA, US$45.0 million, 1966)
and Kemubu (Loan 500-MA, US$10.0 million, 1967). All projects are progressing
satisfactorily.
v.        The economic rate of return of the proposed project is 14.8%.  The
project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$40.0 million to the Government,
for a term of 23 years, including 8 years of grace for the repayment of the
principal. The loan which would be disbursed from 1974 through 1982 would
be onlent by the Government to FELDA on the same terms as the Bank loan.

JOHORE LAND SETTLEMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Malaysia has asked the Bank to help finance
the Johore Tenggara FELDA land settlement program. The proposed project is
part: of this program and aims to establish about 4,400 smallholdings on 65,000
acres of oil palm. About 350 smallholdings on 5,200 acres of rubber would
also be established.  Rubber development, which would be financed by  I
Government, is already well advanced and is not included in the project.
Total project costs are estimated at M$ 209.2 million (US$89.8 million) and
the proposed Bank loan would amount to US$40.0 million, 45% of total project
costs.
1.02      The continued expansion of agriculture, which accounted for 30%
of GDP, 50% of employment and 55% of exports in 1972 is essential for
reducing under- and unemployment in Malaysia. Satisfactory growth of the
economy demands the achievement of high rates of growth in smallholder
agriculture. An effective way of doing this is through new land development
and smallholder settlement programs. Considering the economic prospects
for growing various crops under Malaysian conditions, oil palms are particularly
suited as primary crops in settlement projects. Oil palm growing expanded
from 124,000 acres in 1960 to 1.1 million acres in 1973. The share of the
smallholder oil palm of the total. oil palm area has been increasing steadily
and reached 50% in 1973.  It is projected to rise to 60% by 1980 as a result
of Government policy to foster smallholder development. The project would help
achieve this important policy objective.
1.03      The feasibility study for the proposed project was a component of
a Master Plan for the development of the 250,000 acres rain forest in the
Johore Tenggara region, prepared in 1971 by Hunting Technical Services Ltd.
(UK).
1.04      This report is based upon the findings of a Bank mission which
visited Malaysia in June/July 1973, comprising Messrs Elz, Dax, Panton
and Sandstrom.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      The total land area of Malaysia is about 128,000 square miles.
Less than one-fourth of the area of Peninsular Malaysia (formerly West
Malaysia) and only about 3% of Sarawak and Sabah (formerly East Malaysia)
are under cultivation. Tropical rain forest covers most of the remaining
area. The climate is characterized by uniformly warm to hot temperatures,



- 2 -
- fz?.Su 760Z to 830F, abundant rainfall averaging 90" and is suitable
or oil Vaim cultivation.
-U?      Po>rj5-.0at4on in 1972 was estimated at 11.6 million, growing at
:.2    y-arly.  About 85% of the population is concentrated in Peninsular
Malaysia with the highest densities on the west coast and in the south. On
the Peninzu, a, Malays account for about 53% of the population, Chinese 35%
and Indians 1,.
2.03      The Malaysian economy is export-oriented.  In 1972 exports accounted
for almost 40% of GNP. Main exports were rubber US$557 million, tin US$397
million, timber US$372 million and palm oil US$155 million. Real GNP grew
at an average yearly rate of 6% during the last decade and amounted to about
US$5.5 billion in 1972. Average real GNP per capita, which grew at about
3.0% yearly during the 1960s, was about US$380 in Peninsular Malaysia in
1970. It was only US$280 in the rural areas, and even less (US$180) for
small-scale rice and rubber growers. During the 1960s, consumer prices rose
by about 1% yearly on the average. During 1972-73, however, price increases
accelerated to about 4% yearly, mainly as a result of sharp increases in
import prices.
2.04      Wide disparities in income and ownership of assets reflect ethnic
imbalances. Malays have lower incomes than non-Malays. Much of this
income imbalance arises because nearly 80% of the Malay employment is in
the rural sector compared with slightly more than 50% for the non-Malay.
But even within the rural sector, Malay incomes are generally much lower.
More than half of the total Malay labor force is engaged in traditional low
income smallholder agriculture compared to 14% of the non-Malay labor force.
The dissatisfaction with the distribution of benefits of economic growth and
with growing racial income inequality provides the basis for the New Economic
Policy (NEP). Two of the major aims of this policy, expressed in the Second
Malaysian Plan (SMP) 1971-75, are: (a) to reduce poverty by raising income
levels and increasing employment opportunities for all Malaysians, irrespective
of race; and (b) to accelerate the process of restructuring Malaysian society
to correct economic imbalances so as to reduce and eventually eliminate the
identification of race with economic function. Rapid growth of land develop-
ment will help reduce poverty by creating jobs. It will assist the country's
largest low income group directly by providing higher income employment and
indirectly by siphoning labor away from the traditional smallholder sector.
At the same time land development will help correct economic imbalances because
most of the new land will be settled by Malays.
2.05      Considering the economic prospects for growing various crops
under Malaysian conditions, oil palms are particularly well suited as
primary crops after forest clearing and they can be grown on a large scale
without depletion and damage to the soil.



-3-
B. Oil Palm
2.06      Until 1960, oil palm growing in Malaysia was comparatively unim-
portant, but it expanded rapidly from about 124,000 acres in 1960 to 1.1 mil-
lion acres in 1973. Originally, most of the oil palm was grown on estates,
but by 1973, the smallholder area accounted for about 50% of the total area
and is estimated to increase to about 60% by 1980. Most of the production
is for export, which amounted to 730,000 tons in 1973. Expansion is con-
tinuing and it is estimated that by 1985, Malaysia would produce about
3.2 million tons or 70% of estimated world palm oil and 50% of palm kernel
oil exports. Although the rapid expansion of palm oil production and exports
in Malaysia and other countries has led to increases in the share of this
commodity on total world fats and oils exports, palm oil accounted for
only 8.7% of total world exports in 1972 and there were no difficulties in
selling palm oil on world markets. 1/ This is due mainly to: (a) improve-
ments in quality and processing technology which increased the uses of palm
oil; and (b) the steadily rising import demand for fats and oils particularly
from developing countries.
2.07      Despite its success in introducing large-scale production of palm
oil, Government recognizes the need for diversification to reduce the risk
from heavy reliance on rubber and oil palm and thus made diversification a
major goal of the SMP. Government has recently created the Malaysian Agri-
cultural Research and Development Institute (MARDI) which, besides other
activities, carries out research and experimentation into new crops (Annex 1).
FELDA is cooperating in this effort through commercial scale experiments
in sugar and cocoa. High priority is placed on building an efficient livestock
industry. In 1972, four beef and dairy farms, comprising a total of 17,000 ac
were set up and further expansion is under way.
C. Land Development and Settlement
2.08      Since the early 1960s, Government has given high priority to land
development and settlement, to provide economically viable farm units to
families farming at close to subsistence level and to relieve urban and
rural unemployment. The major public sector programs have been carried out
by FELDA and by State Governments which retain considerable responsibility
for land affairs (Annex 2). The target for new land development under the
SMP is 1 million ac of which 750,000 ac will be developed in Peninsular
Malaysia.
2.09      Federal and State Governments have prepared comprehensive land
development plans for several of the larger regions suited to agricultural
and other development. The first of these was the Jengka Triangle in the
1/   See, Palm Oil - Review and Outlook for Bank Lending, Sec M73-556,
September 14, 1973.



- 4 -
State of Pahang, where FELDA is currently developing 96,400 ac of oil palm
and rubber.  The second is the 750,000 ac Johore Tenggara region, where the
proposed project is situated. A third is the further development of 2.5 mil-
lion ac in Pahang Tenggara where FELDA also has a major development role.
The Bank has been asked to help finance the Keratong project in Pahang
Tenggara and an appraisal report is being prepared. Similar planning studies
are currently being carried out in Kelantan and in Sarawak. Special attention
is given to ecological considerations in designing these development plans
(Annex 3).
2.10      Settlement standards have varied widely, depending largely on the
effectiveness of the project identification and planning process and effi-
ciency of the management. State organized schemes have been generally poor
in comparison with the much better organized and managed FELDA schemes. The
average size of smallholdings outside organized development schemes is
currently around 4 ac, although there is a wide diversity between regions,
due to differences in local land availability, population pressure and other
factors. Without income from other sources, these holdings are too small
to be viable at estimated future palm oil and rubber prices. The consolida-
tion of fragmented and overly small holdings into viable units remains of
high priority and is the focus of programs under the Federal Land Consolidation
and Rehabilitation Authority (FELCRA) and the Rubber Industry Smallholders'
Development Authority (RISDA). Their target acreages under the SMP are 100,000
acres and 150,000 acres respectively. The Bank will be considering financial
assistance to RISDA. FELDA smallholder oil palm holdings have increased from
10 ac allotted to settlers in the 1960s to 14 ac for the proposed poroject
since experience has shown that family labor is under-utilized on smaller            6
holdings.  The average size of 14 ac for oil palm under the proposed project
is a plot which can be managed by one person, and which provides the small-
holder with an income after loan repayment comparable with other sectors of
the smallholder economy (Annex 4).
D. Federal Land Development Authority
2.11      FELDA was created in 1956 to carry out land development and settle-
ment projects. Since then, it has become the largest and most efficient
public land settlement agency in Malaysia. By June 1973, it had developed
about 430,000 ac and settled some 27,500 families. Its original oil palm and
rubber planting program under the SMP was 275,000 ac but this has been raised
tC gbout 400,000 ac since FELDA has already exceeded its annual target in
1972 and is expected to exceed its target for the remaining Plan years. For
further details, see Chapter V.
2.12      FELDA settlers live in villages located within or just outside of
the agricultural areas. These villages have so far been of relatively
modest size; in the Jengka program, an average of about 420 families were
settled in each village. In order to provide settlers with higher public
service standards and a variety of employment opportunities, the village
sizes in new land development areas are now being increased in accordance



-5-
with the Government's NEP. In Johore Tenggara, the FELDA villages will
S           vary in size from about 300 families to more than 1,200 families and in
Pahang Tenggara some 2,500 settler families will be concentrated in one
town. These larger villages or towns should become important growth centers,
attracting both service and manufacturing industries. By the time
thz labor requirements on the agricultural schemes decrease, which coincides
with the time when many of the settler children enter the labor force, the
town economies should be able to absorb this additional labor (Annexes 5 and 6).
E. The Johore Tenggara Regional Master Plan
2.13      A comprehensive analysis of the natural resources and land use
situation in Peninsular Malaysia undertaken during the First Malaysia Plan
(1966-70) led to the identification of several large areas of forested land
with considerable potential for agricultural development, especially in the
south-eastern part of the Peninsula. A Master Plan for development of the
Johore Tenggara region (almost 750,000 ac) was designed. This region was
given priority for large-scale agricultural development because of the
overall quality of its resources and its relatively easy access and close
proximity to existing developed lands in south Johore. Details are in
Annex 7.
F. The Project Area
2.14      The proposed project lies in the Johore Tenggara region of Johore
State, within 40-60 mi north-east of Johore Baharu, the State capital (Map).
It is organized in 16 schemes situated at eight separate sites throughout
the region. The terrain is undulating with friable, deep, sandy clay
loams of proven suitability for oil palm. Rainfall is fairly evenly distri-
buted, varying between 100" and 140". Temperatures range between 76' and
81'F. The 1970 population of the region was about 135,000, including close
to 70,000 in the Kluang and Kota Tinggi urban areas. By 1990 the total
population will exceed 400,000.
2.15      General access to the project area will be via a network of federal
roads (Map) which are now being constructed according to a time schedule
well coordinated with the land development program (para 3.11). Temporary
roads used for timber extraction already allow access to most of the project
schemes. Both present and future water supply for the area comes from
surface sources which are adequate. The project area will be linked to
the national telecommunication network. A new port is being constructed at
Pasir Gudang, about 14 mi east of Johore Baharu. It will contain a FELDA-
owned and operated palm oil bulking facility of 50,000 tons and a loading
wharf. The first phase of 30,000 tons is expected to be operational in 1974.
The facility will handle palm oil from all FELDA schemes in Johore and the
east coast of Peninsular Malaysia.

III.  THE PROJECT
A. Project Description
3.01      The proposed Droject would be part of an ongoing FELDA settlement
program wnich starteu in 1972.  The project would be carried out over 8 years,
1974 through 1981. Principal project components would be:
(a)  clearing of about 81,000 ac of forest and the
planting and maintenance of about 64,800 ac oil palm;
(b)  construction of 8 villages including offices and
public buildings to settle 4,360 families, and
management and support staff, together with appro-
priate roads, water systems and electricity;
(c)  construction of 5 palm oil mills with an ultimate
capacity of 153 tons ffb 1/ per hour.
3.02      Each settler would be provided with 14 ac of planted oLl palm,
a 0.25 ac house lot and a house with piped water. The eight villages serv-
ing the 16 schemes vary in size from 265 settler families to 1,255 settler
families (see Annex 5 and Annex 8, Table 1). Each village would also con-
tain FELDA offices, stores and workshops.  About 2,300 ac of oil palm w'ould
not be distributed but would be managed by FELDA. These areas, spread over
the entire project area, would be kept as reserve to be distributed to
settlers in case of failure of their allotted plots through fire, wind dam-
age or similar disasters. In addition, a block of about 1,500 acres of oil
palm would be set aside to be operated by FELDA as an estate with excess
settler labor.
B. Agricultural Development
Land Tenure
3.03      Land for the project, which is all State Land, has been allocated
to FELDA by the State Government through the Johore Tenggara Development
Authority. The land is developed by FELDA and 5 years after planting,
each settler enters Into an agreement with FELDA making him an occupier
in expectation of title to 14 ac of oil palm in a block of oil palms in common
with a group of other settlers (para 3.16) and a 0.25 ac house plot.
On completion of his loan repayment the settler receives title to the land
(para 5.08). The title is transferable but the land cannot be subdivided.
1/   Fresh fruit bunches:  the fruit of the oil palm (a cluster of oily
nuts around a stem) prior to processing.



- 7-
Clearing and Planting Program
3.04      Before FELDA begins the development of the land and in accordance
with a time schedule which meets FELDA's requirements, marketable timber
is extracted from the forest by licensees under the supervision of the State
Forest Department. Assurances were obtained from the State Government during
negotiations that timber extraction operations will not delay FELDA's clearing
and planting program.
3.05      Typically, felling, land clearing and burning, mostly done manually,
take place during October through March. A leguminous cover crop is planted
afterwards followed by lining operations. Planting usually begins in
September and may extend into the second quarter of the following year depending
on size of the scheme. These operations are carried out by contractors
under FELDA supervision. The crop is then maintained by contract labor for
a further 18 months, during which regular monthly weeding rounds are undertaken,
dead or weak plants are replaced, and regular fertilizer applications are
made. Finally, the settlers, after occupying the village, take over the
responsibility for upkeep. The settlers are paid wages by FELDA up to two
years of harvesting, a period of about 3.0 years. These wages are added to
the settlers' loans.
3.06      The clearing and planting schedule is given in Annex 8, Chart 1,
and is summarized below:
Land Cleared and Planted
(acres)
1972     1973     1974      1975      1976     Total
Forest Clearing          21,223   18,880  22,030   19,150        -      81,283
Panting                    -      17,033  14,459   17,471   15,848    64,811
Cumulative Planting        -      17,033  31,492   48,963   64,811    64,811
More land would be cleared than planted, to allow for roads, villages and
processing facilities.
3.07      Planting material would be produced in FELDA nurseries each of
about 40 ac. They would be established on the scheme site a few months
ahead of the main felling. Adequate supplies of proven planting material
are available in Malaysia.
Labor and Settlers
3.08      The labor force needed for land clearing, preparation and early
maintenance of the main crop areas is provided by contractors (para 3.05)
and is recruited locally from villages and small towns on the periphery of
the development region. Oil palm nursery establishment and maintenance is
carried out directly by FELDA staff, using locally recruited labor which
is obtained largely from neighboring established FELDA schemes.



-8-
3.09      No problems are envisaged in recruiting settlers either from
Johore or other regions of the country.  In March 1973, FELDA had about
11,000 settler applications for an estimated settler intake of 3,800 in
1973. Settler selection procedures are described in para 5.07 and Annex 10.
C. Housing and Infrastructure
Housing
3.10      Settlers' houses are constructed by private contractors, employed
by FELDA. The cost, M$ 1,890 (US$810), including M$ 90 for water connection,
(para 3.12), is charged to the settler's loan account. The houses will be
built of wood and will be elevated and airy in the Malay tradition. Their
design is relatively simple and inexpensive but they will provide the settler
family with a satisfactory shelter. After the development period, when the
income of the settler increases and the agricultural labor requirements are
modest, the settler is expected to upgrade his house to a standard compatible
with his income. This modified sites and services approach is working well
in other FELDA settlements.
Roads
3.11      In addition to the general access highway system now being
constructed in Johore Tenggara (para 2.15), about 16 mi of roads
will have to be built specifically to gain access to project villages
and schemes.  These roads are included in the project.  Assurances were
obtained from the Federal Government during negotiations that the con-
struction schedule for the access highway system will accommodate the
requirements of FELDA's land development program. About 108 mi of local
roads will be constructed within the eight villages (Annex 8, Chart 2). All
road design and construction is carried out through the Federal Public Works
Department (PWD) and financed by Government, whereas maintenance is the
responsibility of the State PWD which receives federal grants for this purpose.
The design standards are those established for all federal roads in Malaysia.
Agricultural roads within the project schemes will be constructed and maintained
by FELDA.
Water Supply and Sewerage
3.4 ~     Treated water will be supplied to the villages from surface
iater sources.  The water supply systems will be designed and constructed
through the Federal PWD and operated and maintained by the State PWD. The
water will be metered and charged at a present rate of M$ 1.00 per 1,000
gallons, which covers the cost.
3.13      The only sewerage facilities to be provided for the settlers
are "back-houses", as is customary in FELDA villages. This is satisfactory,
considering the present low population density and the soil conditions in
the area. However, Bukit Sening, with 1,255 settlers, may become an important



-9-
growth center and Sungai Sebol/Penggeli Timor will later become integrated
with the new town of Bandar Tenggara and these two settlements should there-
fore be planned for eventual installation of a central sewerage system. As-
surances to this effect were obtained from FELDA during negotiations.
Communal Facilities
3.14      A primary school system will be provided in each village with
approximately one school with 6 classrooms per 400 settler families. Secondary
schools will be built in the six largest of the eight villages. A health
sub-center, staffed with one hospital assistant (paramedic) and one nurse
and visited by a physician on a regular basis, is to be provided in the five
largest villages. Each of the three smallest villages will have a community
clinic staffed with one nurse. In addition, each village will have a community
center, a police post and a mosque (Annex 5 and Annex 8, Chart 2). FELDA,
through federal grants, provides the funds for the construction of the
community centers and the mosques while the responsible federal ministries
provide the funds for the construction and operation of the schools, health
sub-centers, community clinics and police posts. Electricity supply from
the national grid system will not be available until the 1980's and meanwhile
diesel generators will be installed and operated by FELDA for FELDA's use.
Commercial Facilities
3.15      A cooperative shop, operated by the FELDA Stores Corporation (FSC)
(para 5.03), is to be located in each village. Eventually the purchasing
power of the settlers and the availability of labor will induce the establish-
ment of more commercial and service facilities, which is an important aspect
of the maturing process of the villages (Annex 5). The village plans are
drawn to accommodate this growth. Assurances will be obtained from FELDA
during negotiations that they will not prevent the establishment of independent
enterprises in the villages and that they will make land available to entre-
p^ieeurs in accordance with village plans after settlers have been established
and the economic and social structure of the village has been determined.
D. Harvesting and Processing
3.16      Correct timing of harvest, careful handling and speedy trans-
portation of the fresh fruit bunches to the mill, followed by rapid process-
ing, are essential for production of high quality palm oil. FELDA ex-
perience has shown that a group harvesting system is the most practical
method for obtaining the required standards. Under this system, settlers
are grouped into teams of 20 and are made responsible for cutting and
collection of the fruit from a designated 280 ac block, equivalent to
their aggregate entitlement of holdings under their agreements with the
authority. The group works under the supervision of an elected group
leader who allocates individual tasks and checks the quality of the work
done under the supervision of the FELDA scheme manager (para 5.18). Trausport-
ation of the fresh fruit bunches from harvesters' collection points to pro-
cessing mills would be undertaken by private haulage contractors.



- 10 -
3.17      Five palm oil mills, with a total capacity of 153 tons ffb/hr
in 1982, would be constructed by FELDA to handle the requirements of
the project. Construction of the first mill will commence in 1975 and the
last will be completed in 1981 (Annex 8, Table 2). With the development of
the proposed project, FELDA will have a total of 105,000 ac of oil palm in
Johore Tenggara handled through eight mills. As in its other schemes, FELDA
would prepare plans and specifications, would supervise mill construction
and would manage their operation. Transportation of the oil to the port
for export would be handled by private contractors.
E. Management
3.18      There will be a manager with a staff of 17 to 26 persons for
each of the 16 schemes. Management housing and offices will be located
in the 8 villages and will be constructed through FELDA by private con-
tractors (Annex 8, Chart 2). A retail store will be built in conjunction
with each scheme office and operated through the FELDA Stores Corporation
(para 5.03). Each scheme office will be provided with 2 Land Rovers, 2
tractors, and 1 diesel generator for electricity supply. Staff salaries and
other management operating costs during the development period are included
in the project cost, in addition to the capital costs for housing, offices,
vehicles, and equipment.
F. Ecology
3.19      Land development within the project area would be carried out in
conformity with the Malaysian Conservation Act which provides an adequate
safeguard against erosion, siltation and excessive flooding (Annex 3).
The FELDA project area is confined entirely to the undulating or low hilly
lands containing soils of proven suitability for tree crop and village site
development, and excludes the steeper land areas where a multiple land use
policy based on permanent forestry would be introduced. Those areas of
forest which have marketable timber potential will be worked on a sustained
yield basis using an assisted regeneration system of forest improvement.
The remainder will be conserved as protective forest and utilized as
recreational-cum-tourist areas or as strict nature reserves as required (Map).
The entire permanent forest reserve area will serve an essential water
ec<.ervation role by safeguarding the regularity of run-off required to
meet Lhe increasing internal demand for water supplies within the settled
portions of the region. It will also afford a sanctuary for the wild life
which may be driven out of the area cleared for agriculture.
3.20      Processing mills would be sited at appropriate distances away
from residential areas, in proximity to adequate water supplies, to reduce
the consequences of pollution from effluents (a subject which is being given
close attention by MARDI). Natural forest would be retained as river bank
reserves within the areas of agricultural development to avoid felling large



- 1 1 -
trees into river beds causing adverse effects on river flow and danger to
bridges or other downstream structures.
IV. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING
A. Project Costs
4.01      Project costs from 1972 through 1981, are estimated at M$ 209.2
million (US$89.8 million) with a foreign exchange component of M$ 50.8 million
(US$21.8 million) or 24% of project costs.
4.02      Detailed project cost estimates are at Annex 9, Table 1 and are

- 12 -
;03       The est±mates are based on experience in similar FELDA schemes.
l.r. reiatLvely low physical contingency (5%) is justified by the competitive-
ness of experienced field development contractors as well as the standard-
ization of factory design. A price contingency for both local and foreign
r   of 5% compounded annually has been added.  The cost of settlement
per family, excluding social costs (roads, water supply, and public buildings)
would be US$14,100, net of contingencies.
B. Proposed Financing
4.04      It is proposed that a Bank loan of US$40.0 million (M$ 93.2 mil-
lion) to be disbursed from 1974 through 1982 be made to Government for
23 years, including a grace period of 8 years for repayments of principal.
The proposed loan would finance about 45% of project costs. US$14.3
million would be for foreign exchange expenditures and US$25.7 million
equivalent for local currency costs. The loan would be onlent by Government
to FELDA on the same terms as the Bank loan.
4.05      Remaining project costs, US$49.8 million, would be met by:  (a)
Government loans to FELDA of US$29.5 million covering 27% of agricultural
development costs, housing and processing, and 30% of the costs of fertilizer,
pesticides, vehicles and equipment; (b) direct Government expenditure of
US$11.9 million for roads, water supply and public buildings; (c) Government
grants to FELDA of US$8.4 million for management operating costs (Annex 9,
Table 2).  The Government loan, which would be at the same terms as other
Government loans to FELDA, would be at 5-1/2%, repayable over 25 years,
including ten years of grace on principal. No interest would be charged
for the first five years. FELDA loan terms to oil palm settlers are in
Chapter V. Since the timing of felling and clearing operations is dictated
by climatic conditions, some contracts have been let (in conformity to Bank
guidelines) since August 1, 1973, in order not to hold up the project. The
value of such ac:vance contracts does not exceed US$2.5 million. Disburse-
ment against such contracts will be for expenditures incurred after the
date of loan signing. Government would make available to FELDA, monthly
and in advance, the investment funds and working capital required by
the project. This would be on the basis of the appraisal estimates as
revised by FELDA and as approved by the Bank from time to time. Assurances
to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
.

C. Procurement and Disbursement
4.07      Contracts with an estimated value of US$31.5 million net of
contingencies (44% of project costs) would be let under international com-
petitive bidding, in accordance with Bank guidelines. This would include
land clearing and planting (US$11.2 million), housing and office buildings
(US$5.4 million); upgrading of roads and culverts (US$2.7 million); palm oil
mill machinery and construction (US$11.5 million); and vehicles and equipment
(US$0.7 million). Sufficient experienced contractor capacity for land
clearing and house construction is available in Malaysia and all of it is
likely to be carried out by local contractors, as in the Jengka projects.
A range of mill machinery and vehicle components is manufactured in Malaysia
and the Bank would agree that local manufacturers would be allowed a margin
of protection of 15% or the customs duty, whichever is less, again as in the
Jengka projects.
4.08      As in the Jengka project, fertilizer and pesticides estimated to
cost US$10.7 million (15% of project cost) would be procured through the
effective system which FELDA has establishe4 to supply its entire land
settlement program. It would be neither practical nor economical to estab-
lish a separate supply system for the project, and therefore project
requirements would be purchased after local competition between the major
international fertilizer companies which are well represented in Malaysia.
4.09      Roads, water supply systems and public buildings estimated at
*           US$10.0 million (14% of project costs) and financed by Government, would
be constructed on PWD force account.
4.10      The remaining costs of US$19.7 million (27% of project cost) are
direct FELDA expenditures such as salaries, settlers' wages during the
development period and planting material and as such are not suitable for
local or international competitive bidding.



- 14 -
4.11      IBRD financed expenditures and disbursements are at Annex 9, Table
4 and 5 respectively.  Disbursements would generally follow the procedures
adopted for Jengka Loans 533-MA, 672-MA and 885-MA and would be made against
appropriate documents as follows:
(a) 90% of total costs for land clearing and planting,
upgrading of agricultural roads, housing, house
lot development on oil palm schemes, and palm oil
mill construction and machinery; and
(b) 100% of the foreign cost of directly imported fertilizer,
pesticides, vehicles and equipment, or 100% of the
ex-factory price (excluding taxes) if manufactured locally,
or 70% of total expenditure if imported but procured
locally.
D. Accounts and Audit
4.12      As with the three Jengka projects, FELDA would maintain a
separate account for this project, and it would be audited independently.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that independent auditors
satisfactory to the Bank would be appointed to audit the project and FELDA's
overall accounts. The Government's and FELDA's financial year is January 1
through December 31. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that FELDA
would furnish to the Bank within six months following the close of the fiscal
year signed copies of the auditor's report.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. FELDA
5.01      A description of FELDA's organization, objectives and performance
is in Annex 6. The Authority is a Government-owned agency under the Ministry
of National and Rural Development with a wide range of autonomy on day to
day operations.
5.1)?     FELDA is provided with most of its funds from Government budgetary
allocations. The balance has been covered by IBRD and a loan from the
Asian Development Bank. A Board of 12 members under an Executive Chairman
includes representatives of public agencies and the private sector. The
Board determines operating policies and carries overall responsibility. The
chief executive of FELDA is the Director General who is also a member of the
Board. As in previous Bank loans, assurances were obtained during negotia-
tions that the Bank will be afforded an adequate opportunity to comment on the
qualifications and experience of any proposed new appointee to the position
of Chairman of the Board or Director General of FELDA.
I



- 15 -
5.03      The FELDA Stores Corporation (FSC) with the Director General as
chairman but with a separate constitution operates a string of retail
shops serving FELDA settlers. Fifty-one percent of the equity of the FSC
is retained by FELDA and the balance is for issue to settler cooperatives.
Similarly, the marketing department, which is presently under the direct
s"pervision of the Director General, will become a separate entity early
next year as FELDA Marketing Corporation with the Director General as
chairman. This change allows a more flexible and independent operation
than is possible for an organization solely controlled by Government.
5.04      FELDA is the main Government agency responsible for implementing
Government's settlement policies. Because of its proven ability to carry
out these policies, it has been given increasing targets. Yearly plantings
of oil palm and rubber have increased from 10,500 acres in 1960 to nearly
100,000 ac in 1973. In addition, the Authority has been given a greater role
in the Government's crop diversificaion policy. In 1973, about 3,100 ac
were planted with sugar cane and 5,000 ac of cocoa are expected to be planted
in 1974-75.
5.05      The rapid expansion of FELDA operations has not been without
problems. Delays have occurred in implementing the planting program
and settler intake leading to higher costs, mainly because of delays in
infrastructure development (roads, water supply) which is carried out by
Government agencies. These shortcomings were partly the result of unrealistic
time schedules in the early years. More realistic schedules are now worked
out and cost projections made accordingly.
S           5.06       Another shortcoming in FELDA operations has been its financial
accounting system. The system was not able to meet the needs of an expanding,
diversified organization. As a result, Public Administration Services (PAS),
a Chicago-based consulting firm, was engaged in 1972 to improve the situation.
They introduced a computerized accounting system which is now being implemented.
Apart from streamlining and speeding up financial accounting, departmental
recording and reporting systems will be coordinated to a degree which has
not been possible before.
B. Settlement Procedures
Settler Selection
5.07      Most of the settlers are Malays (para 2.04).  Selected candidates
are mainly landless peasants, poor smallholders or ex-servicemen. They must
own less than two acres of land to be eligible. At least 50% of the project
settlers will be from Johore. Interviews are carried out in two stages,
first at district level and then at national level; the final selection is
based on a points system which takes account of age and family circumstances,
experience and capabilities, landownership and educational level. Details are
in Annex 10.



- 16 -
e    rS tatus
Settlers sign the first part of the agreement with FELDA on
arrival at the scheme. This entitles them to a FELDA loan which covers
all agricultural development costs, housing and house lot expenses during
the develonment period. It also biids them to the rules laid down by FELDA
and to carry out work on the scheme as instructed by FELDA management staff.
Failure to abide by the rules may result in the settler being expelled from
the schemc. Dur'ng t-In  early years of settlement, the settlers carry out
maiatenance W3orI on the scheme, for which they receive a minimum of M$ 2.90 per
day. If monthly earnings are less than M$ 70, the wage is supplemented by a
subsistence loan to bring the monthly income up to this level. For the
proposed project, incomes of oil palm settlers will be sufficiently large
not to warrant subsistence parments. Detailed cost and income data for an
oil palm holding are at Annex 11.
5.09      At the end of the fifth year after oil palm planting, loan
repayment begins and the settler signs the second part of his agreement.
This registers him as an occupier in expectation of title to 14 ac of oil
palm, together with a house lot of 0.25 ac. Once the settler has paid off
his loan, he acquires title to the land (para 3.03). Oil palms are maintained
and harvested in blocks of 280 acres, and the settler receives a right to a
share of proceeds equivalent to his share of the joint holding which would
be managed by FELDA until loan repayment is completed.
5.10      Loans to settlers covering agricultural development costs
(including wages paid to the settler during the development period) and
housing are repayable at 6-1/4% over 15 years after the 6 year development             S
period during which interest is capitalized (see Annex 11, Table 5).
Investment in factory construction and equipment is recovered by a
processing fee to settlers which is sufficient to cover factory operation
costs and generate a reasonable return on investment. Management costs, which
are similar to extension services costs, which are not normally recovered from
benef.ciaries, would also be recovered in this project by a price-proportional
levy (see Annex 10, Table 1) raised when settlers' income exceeds the target
of M$ 3,600 per year. At present prices management costs are fully recovered.
The elements of subsidy in these terms are consistent with Government income
policy in the smallholder sector and offer satisfactory incentives for
settlers to contribute their labor and enterprise to the task of opening up
new land (see also para 7.03).
C. Area Office
5.11      The project will be controlled from the FELDA South Area Office,
one of seven set up in 1971 in an effort to create more flexible and dynamic
operational direction and control of development. The area controller
in charge of this office would advise on the selection of contractors
for agricultural development and civil works, and would coordinate infrastructure
and public building construction with the respective federal or state agencies.
The office would manage the project, keep accounts, and coordinate harvesting
and transportation of oil palm fruits to mills.  The staff have gained much
experience in recent years and are performing satisfactorily.                          0



- 17 -
5.12      The area controller reports directly to the Deputy Director
General for Field Administration in headquarters, and maintains close
contact with the Agricultural Services Director on all agricultural matters.
A manager would be in charge of each 3,000 to 6,000 acre scheme and would
be supported by an assistant manager, between two and four field supervisors,
and double these numbers of field assistants at full development on each
scheme. FELDA experience has shown this staffing plan appropriate and
feasible in relation to the present recruitment and training programs.
D. Communal Services
5.13      The respective departments of the Federal Government would pro-
vide staff for, and meet the recurrent costs of schools, health centers,
and police posts constructed under the project. Assurances to this effect
were obtained during negotiations. Such arrangements have worked well
in the Jengka Triangle projects.
VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND FINANCIAL RESULTS
A. Yields and Production
6.01      For the proposed project, it is assumed that palms have a life of
30 years. Harvesting begins in the fourth year after planting. Yield
estimates (Annex 12) are based on data available from other FELDA schemes
already in production in other parts of Johore and South Pahang, where
climatic and soil conditions are similar and where the same type of planting
material has been used. Peak oil palm yields of 9.2 tons ffb per ac and
an oil extraction rate of 21% are projected in the sixth year in harvest.
Kernel output is 4.2% of ffb production.
6.02      Total palm oil and kernel production from the project is estimated
at 2.2 million tons and 440,000 tons respectively. Peak production would
be reached in 1985. In that year 123,500 tons palm oil and 24,800 tons
palm kernels would be produced.
B. Marketing and Prices
6.03      Settlers would sell their ffb to FELDA under a pricing formula which
would enable FELDA to cover fully its processing and transportation costs
(see Annex 11). After processing, palm oil would be exported and kernels
would be sold locally for further processing as kernel oil and expeller cake.
6.04      Palm oil produced in Peninsular Malaysia is sold through a pool
operated by the Malaysian Palm Oil Producers' Association (MPOPA). Members



- 18 -
0` the MPOPA are mill owners.  The larger companies own bulking installa-
-ions wn.ich handie sales for their own companies and for those mill owners
who do nat own bulking installations.  Proceeds from all sales are pooled
and every member of the pool receives the same price allowing for quality
differences. Until June 1973, these installations handled sales of palm
oil from FELDA settlements since FELDA production was relatively small.
With the construction of its own bulking installations and in anticipation
of its rapidly increasing sales, FELDA has established its own network of
selling agents and brokers which are directed through FELDA's marketing
department. All Malaysian Government-to-Government palm oil sales (such as
those to India and China) are executed by FELDA. To allow for greater
marketing flexibility and independence a separate FELDA Marketing Corporation
(FMC) will be formed early 1974 (see para 5.03).
6.05      A recent study by the Bank's Commodities and Export Projection
Division 1/ indicates that the export demand prospects for fats and oils,
including palm oil, up to 1980 and also in the following decade remain
favorable. Project output of palm oil would account for about 2.5% of
estimated world exports of palm oil in 1985. The Secretariat of the Inter-
governmental Group on Oil Seeds, Oils and Fats, has been informed of the
project and raised no objection. Only a moderate fall in the price of palm
oil is expected. A price range of US$197/ton to US$220/ton (cif Europe)
in constant 1972/73 terms is projected for 1980 and thereafter. The
economic rate of return analysis of the project is based on a price of
US$197/ton. Sensitivity analysis takes account of the higher price in the
range (Annex 13).
C. Financial Results
6.06      Settlers.  Participating settlers would benefit substantially under
the project. Most would be landless rubber tappers and casual workers (to-
gether about 60% of all settlers), poor smallholders or largely unemployed
urban dwellers. Before joining the scheme they earn an average yearly income
of about M$ 850-900 which puts them in the lowest quintile of income groups
in Malaysia (Annex 13). The average net settler income through the life of
the project after they go on the block system (i.e. five years after planting)
is estimated at about M$ 3,200/year (Annex 11, Table 6). Settlers will earn
about an average yearly M$ 3,800 (US$1,600) after loan repayment, i.e.
20 years after planting. These income levels are reasonable and in line with
government income targets for smallholders (Annex 4).
6.07      FELDA.  A projected cash flow is in Annex 9, Table 2.  It indicates
that annual deficits would occur until 1978.  This would be met out of FELDA
reserves or by Government. Surpluses would arise first in 1979 and these
would remain positive on a cumulative basis until 2002 when repayment of the
replanting cess to smallholders (or its use for replanting) would cause a
deficit. However, sufficient funds to cover this deficit would be available
from interest received on the accumulated surpluses.
I/   See, Palm Oil - Review and Outlook for Bank Lending, SecM73-556,
September 14, 1973.



- 19 -
6.08      Government.  A projected cash flow is in Annex 9, Table 3.  Revenues
accruing to Government from the project would be sufficient to repay its
development and operating costs under the project and to establish a cumulative
surplus of M$ 163 million by the end of the project period. Cumulative deficit
during project development would peak at M$ 93 million in 1981. This deficit
would be met by Government.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      The proposed project forms a vital part of the development strategy
for the Johore Tenggara region. It would support Government plans to achieve
high rates of growth in smallholder agriculture through land development,
thereby reducing unemployment and underemployment and increasing incomes of
the rural population. At peak production (1985) yearly sales ex mill are
estimated at M$ 57 million (US$24 million). Industrial development will be
induced through the construction of oil palm mills and storage facilities which
will generate increased local manufacture of mill and storage equipment.
Settlers' average yearly incomes would rise from about M$ 870 (US$375) before
they join the scheme to M$ 3,800 (US$1,600) after they finish loan repayments.
7.02      The project will contribute to the establishment of a number of
urban growth centers. These centers will help redirect urban migration from
a few large cities to medium-sized towns. They will bring additional long-
term employment opportunities to settlers and their dependents.  About 10,200
persons would find permanent employment through the project; 4,900 would be
directly employed on the schemes, while some 5,300 persons would fill the
additional jobs induced in the villages and in other nearby urban centers.
A total population of about 30,000 persons would be supported by these jobs.
In addition roughly 6,000 workers would be directly employed during the
development period.
7.03      Settlement costs of US$14,100 per settler are well justified.
The growth of the Malaysian economy and the reduction of un- or underemployment
depends to a large extent on land development. Lower cost schemes during
the early 1960's have failed due to a lack of sufficient incentives to settlers.
Furthermore, under Malaysian geographic conditions, oil palm is an ideal crop
to open up land because it allows planting and cultivation on roughly prepared
land with little if any detriment to the soil and ultimate felling of the
palms for replanting or new crops is not expensive. Clean clearing forest
for pasture or annual crops would be much more costly.
7.04      The economic rate of return is estimated at 14.8%.  Details of
the analysis are in Annex 13. Major assumptions underlying the analysis
include:  (a) exclusion from costs of water supply, school and health
center construction on the grounds that their benefits are excluded and
would at least equal costs; (b) a shadow wage for labor of M$ 2.90/day,
equivalent to an average yearly income of M$ 870/year, in line with the
average income settlers earn before joining FELDA, comparing with M$ 3.50/day
earned by casual non-skilled labor working on FELDA schemes; (c) yields
*         given in Annex 12; and (d) an export price (cif Europe) of US$197/ton.  This



- 20 -
is the low price of the range given in Bank commodity price projections.
With the high price of this range (US$220/ton) and the above assumptions,
the economic rate of return would be 16.8%. The rate of return calculated
without shadow pricing and assuming that real wage rates would rise by 3%
yearly, starting with an actual rate of M$ 3.50/day in 1973, would be 13.5%.
7.05      Except for the part obtained by the Government, most of the benefits
of the project accrues to settlers whose present and expected future incomes
are well below average Malaysian incomes. The distributional impact of the
project is therefore clearly favorable.
VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      The proposed project is financially and economically sound and
is suitable for a Bank loan of US$40.0 million repayable over 25 years
including 8 years of grace on repayment of principal.
8.02      The following principal assurances were obtained during negotiations:
(a)  timber clearance operations will not delay the
clearing and planting programs (para 3.04);
(b)  the construction shcedule for the access highway
system will accommodate the requirements of FELDA's land
development program (para 3.11);
*c)  FELDA will not prevent the establishment of independent
enterprises in project villages and will make land
available to independent entrepreneurs in accordance
with the village plans (para 3.15);
(d)  the respective departments of the Federal Government
would provide staff for, and meet the recurrent costs of
schools, health centers, and police posts constructed
under the project (para 5.13).
(e)  The villages of Bukit Sening and Sungai Sebol/Penggeli
Timor will be planned for eventual installation of a
central sewerage system (para 3.13).

JOHORE LAND SETTLEMENT PROJECT
The Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute
1.        The Malaysian Agricultural Reserach and Development Institute
(MARDI) is a statutory Malaysian Government Body constituted by Act of
Parliament in 1969. It became operational in March 1971 when a nucleus
staff was seconded from the Research and Agronomy branches of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture. Since that date the professional staff has grown to
over 100 research officers. Facilities, including experimental stations,
laboratory and office buildings and equipment, have been taken over from
other agencies of Government or acquired in accordance with a phased program
of expansion which aims at an eventual total of some 350 research officers
by 1975.
2.        The decision by the Malaysian Government to establish MARDI
reflects recognition of the need for a central organization to make better
use of the scarce personnel and financial resources than was previously
possible when agricultural research was the responsibility of a number of
individual institutes and departments.  A single autonomous research organi-
*            zation is better able to provide the administrative flexibility required
for productive research and high staff morale. It is also better able to
provide continuity of research and the long-range planning and budgeting
essential for effective work, particularly when it is assured of a minimum
budget for periods of five or more years, which was never possible in the
case of departmental research groups.
3.        MARDI personnel and their support staff are based at the head-
quarters research station near Serdang, about 15 mi south of Kuala Lumpur,
and at an expanding network of regional experimental stations in the main
agro-ecologic regions of the country. These research stations are special-
izing on particular crops which are either representative of the regions
at the present time, or which may have a development potential in those
regions.
Organization and Staff
4.        The Institute is headed by a Director who is responsible to a
Governing Board, on which are representatives of Government agencies and
other statutory bodies and private sector organizations engaged in, or
interested in the results of agricultural research. There is also a
Science Council which initiates or examines and approves proposals for
research, and which is advised by a number of special advisory committees
dealing with specific crops or other research topics.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
Iei-rector is assisted by two deputies, for Programs and for
ana by an Assistant Director who is responsible for Develop-
ment. P?bic-ica`ons and Library.  The Program Director supervises the work
v.esu  ec- matter divisions which are further divided into 28 branches.
Some fiexibility is introduced into this scientific discipline-based organi-
zation by the formatior. oi research units or teams, headed by the more
e rienc   L~.res arch tam, leaders, which concentrate on particular crop,
c;or>aOQy or rJO'.iC  areas.
6.        The  rnstitute is presently very short of senior research person-
nel who have tlhe experience necessary to provide research team leadership
and to guide and advise the disproportionately large number of enthusiastic
and well qualified but relatively inexperienced younger professionals. This
deficiency, which is likely to persist for several years, is partly being
met from technical assistance sources, the scale of which is expected to
increase in the near future.
Finance
7.        In January 1972 MARDI received its first annual budget allocation
and M$ 15.5 million were expended during this first year. The 1973 alloca-
tion totals M$ 12.4.million, of which M$ 7.4 million is for operating and
M$ 5.0 million is for development expenditure.
8.        In addition to the above allocations, two special funds for oil
palm production and consumption research totalling M$ 6.5 and M$ 9 million
respectively are in operation for the period to 1975, and the aim
is to obtain a similar block budget to cover the entire operating and
development expenditure of the Institute for the period 1975-80. The
details of this budget request, which is expected to total around M$ 160 mil-
lion, are currently being prepared.
Oil Palm Research
9.        The oil palm research program is particularly strong, supported
by an active advisory committee which is not only appreciative of the prob-
lems faced by the industry, but is also able to judge which of these prob-
lems are most likely to be solved by research and to establish working
priorities. FELDA is represented on this advisory committee.
10.       The current list of research topics includes a long-term breeding
program aimed at improving the quality of oil palm planting material. This
calls for a widening of the range of genetic material available to the plant
breeders, and an expedition is currently in West Africa collecting material
sufficient for the establishment of a 500 ac genetic materials garden in
Peninsula M'aiaysia.
11.       An oil palm physiology research project, which is a cooperative
project involving ALARDI staff and staff from a private company, is based on
the company's research station in south Johore.  This research will be very



ANNEX 1
Page 3
relevant to FELDA's oil palm yield research, which are suspected to be
due in part to moisture stress inherent to the sedentary soils found on
all FELDA schemes, in contrast to the moisture and more fertile alluvial
soils found on many private estates, which yield considerably higher.
12.       A team which will investigate the nutritional problems of the oil
palm will also be established shortly, and will be equally relevant to the
FELDA yield situation, which may be improved through a better understanding
of the nutritional balance and fertilizer requirement of the palm under
variable agro-climatic conditions. Both the above programs would benefit
from team leadership provided through foreign aid.
13.       Milling standards and optimum times for harvesting of fruit in
relation to palm oil yield and quality are also receiving special attention.
A private company with its own research facility has been contracted to
undertake a special study of palm oil mill effluent treatment, as a res-
ponse to the pollution problem which is arising in the larger processing
mills which are now becoming commonplace in the industry.
14.       A new experimental station is being set up on a 4,300 ac site
near Kluang, within the Johore Tenggara master plan region, which will
specialize in oil palm, pastures, fodder and beef cattle experimentation.
One thousand ac have been cleared to date. This main oil palm research
station is in a similar agro-climatic zone to the Johore Tenggara FELDA
Project area, with similar topography, soils and rainfall, so that research
experience derived from this station is likely to have direct application
0          to the project area and to other FELDA schemes already existing in the
State of Johore.
15.       The inception of this new station provides an ideal opportunity
for FELDA and MARDI to integrate their respective research on oil palm
to the extent that MARDI concentrates on long-term breeding, nutritional
and physiological research and other problems common to the industry as a
whole, while the small cadre of FELDA research personnel concentrate on
the numerous production problems inherent to FELDA's own operations which
can be solved by applied research effort.
Other Research
16.       Other major research projects involve the improvement of the
rice, pineapple, cocoa, fruit and livestock industries. Priority is being
given to livestock improvement, with accent on beef, pastures and feed-
grains development designed to increase the availability of locally produced
animal protein.
17.       Rice research is aimed at increasing overall production efficiency
within existing rice growing areas to the extent that Malaysia becomes 90%
self-sufficient. To this end, investigations are continuing into rotational
and multiple cropping patterns suitable for the rice growing areas, where
.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
double crop irrigation facilities are now widespread.  Breeding and selection
work is being concentrated on improving the quality of local rice varieties
to meet consumer taste preferences.
18.       Cocoa has been identified as a most promising diversification
crop. A horticultural crop research program has been formulated to develop
this potential, together with the wide range of local fruits, whLch present
considerable opportunities for upgrading.
19.       The Malaysian pineapple industry is facing very stiff competition,
accentuated by UK entry into the EEC, and priority is accordingly being
given to developing better varieties capable of giving higher recovery
rates on processing, thus reducing costs and thereby increasing the compe-
titive position of the industry.
20.       A request for Bank financing to strengthen MARDI research in
several of the above fields has been received and a team of research con-
sultants is likely to visit Malaysia in December this year in order to
prepare a suitable project for appraisal early in 1974.

JOHORE LAND SETTLEMENT PROJECT
Agricultural Development Background for FELDA
Development Strategy
1.        FELDA agricultural development methods have much in common with
those of the private estate sector of the Malaysian agricultural industry
modified as necessary in the light of FELDA's own considerable experience.
These methods include extensive use of contractors to undertake the establish-
ment of the main crops, and of village site and processing facility construc-
tion, together with the employment of a management staff on all schemes to
ensure the effective organization of the settlers labor and maintain the
highest possible standards of crop production and processing.
2.        The scale and complexity of FELDA's operations call for a high
level of planning efficiency on the part of the Authority. It must super-
vise the work of a large number of contractors and coordinate the supporting
activities of a wide range of public sector agencies. At the same time
it has to attend to its own steadily increasing commitments in respect to
recruitment, training, and establishment and operation of its schemes.
3.        As the scale of FELDA's operations has increased, so also has the
size of its average scheme, and the extent to which schemes are grouped
together for reasons of operational efficiency. The earliest schemes,
established in the late fifties, were around 2,000 ac in size, but
with experience this has increased to between 5,000 and 7,000 ac at the
present time; equivalent to that of the larger estate units in the private
sector.
4.        In the early days it was usually possible to select sites suitable
for schemes in most states of West Malaysia, but within a few years almost
all the available and suitable land having convenient access within the
west coast states had been taken up, either by FELDA or by other public
and private sector agricultural organizations. By the mid-sixties FELDA
was, therefore, obliged by circumstances to concentrate its site selection
activities within the large region of relatively undeveloped but
agriculturally suitable land, with limited access, which occupies the
southeastern segment of Peninsular Malaysia. Several choice sites of
contiguous potential agricultural land suitable for tree crop establishment,
each 100,000 ac or more in extent, had been identified through surveys
within this large region of around 5 million ac, and FELDA obtained
agreement in principle from the State Governments concerned for development
of several of these tracts.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
5. Rhe first such tract to be developed systematically as an area of
conraentrated settlement was the Taib Andak Complex in the State of Johore.
T.;is coGr:lex which contains 5 scheries with an aggregate area of more than
2i,000 plarnted ac of oil palm. In 1966 a more ambitious program of
development commenced in the Jengka Triangle portion of the State of Pahang,
in conformity with a master plan prepared by a consortium of consultants.
This study which recommended the cultivating of 93,000 ac of oil palm and
rubber, was *Dartly financed by a Bank technical assistance grant and the
development is being partly financed by a succession of three Bank loans
over the period 1967-1981.
6.        In 1969 and 1970 two further development planning studies were
commenced. They covered the Johore and Pahang Tenggara Regions,
respectively, which include the greater part of the southeast agricultural
development region referred to above. These studies were more comprehensive
in scope and covered larger areas of potential agricultural land than did
the Jengka Triangle Study, and they took account of the needs and capacities
of other agricultural interests besides FELDA. In recognition of the major
contribution which FELDA would make to the agricultural sector development
in each of these regions, special feasibility studies for large blocks of
land previously committed in principal to FELDA by the State Governments,
were carried out in both the Johore and Pahang Tenggara Regions. I/
7.        FELDA schemes in these two projects differ from the earlier
Jengka Pro1ects in the size of individual settler holdings.  The increase
in the size of the holding from 10 to 14 acres is justified both by
employment and income considerations. A 14-acre holding just about provides
employment for one full-time laborer (see Annex 11, Table 2) whereas a
10-acre holding leaves the settler underemployed. This would present an
acute problem in newly opened up areas with limited outside employment
opportunities. Also, a 14-acre holding is required to provide an income
that is consistent with a targeted 3.5% rate of growth of real incomes
in the smallholder sector (see Annex 4).
1/   The importance of FELDA's role in the Second Malaysia Plan (SMP)
period is apparent from the fact that the Authority's target of
275,000 ac at the start of the plan period was raised to about
400,000 shortly after the commencement of the period, at which
level it is equivalent to 40% of the national target of 1 million
ac of new land development during the SMP. 47,000 ac and 73,000
ac were developed by FELDA in the first and second years of the
plan, and 100,000 ac is being targeted for the current year,
to be followed by 90,000 ac in each of the final two years.

JOHORE LAND SETTLEMENT PROJECT
Ecology
1.        During the preparation of the master plan for Johore Tenggara
(see Annex 7), special attention was given to assessment of the impact which
development will have on the ecological conditions of the region, and of the
conservation needs associated with these developments. The plan took into
account the need for protection of water catchments and reservoirs, the
removal or avoidance of pollution, the conservation of biological
communities, jungle reserves and wild life, and the preservation of scenic
assets in the interests of recreation and tourism. To this end, the
legally established slope cultivation limit of 200 would be vigorously
enforced in accordance with the Malaysian Conservation Enactment, and
steeper land would be utilized either for controlled forestry on a sustained
yield basis or reserved to serve a strictly protective function, depending
on the relative productivity of the forest and the extent to which the
productive forest can be satisfactorily worked without impairing conservation
standards. A multiple land use policy which includes wild life and water
resource conservation is being applied in these areas.
2.        In addition to the above, several areas containing distinct vege-
tation and biological communities have been identified for permanent reser-
vation as strict nature reserves, protective forests or recreational areas
below the steepland boundary. These sites, which are of special scientific
or aesthetic interest, include examples of beach forest, alluvial swamp
forest, mangrove forest and coastal hill forest.
3.        The depth and range of analysis and survey of the more important
ecologic factors - climate, topography, soil, forestry, geology, vegeta-
tion, wild life, and water, -- coupled with the close attention given to
conservation and pollution aspects of development in the master plan, are
indicative of the Malaysian Government's concern for the problem of
maintaining an ecological balance. Rigorous enforcement of the conserva-
tion and pollution regulations and a continuous monitoring of the situation
by the LKJT during the 20 year development period should ensure that the
Johore Tenggara Region becomes a model of multiple land use and coordinated
conservation of natural resources.
4.        Careful site selection, with special attention given to suitability
of topography, soil and drainage, both for the main commercial tree crop
areas and for villages, where dusun (orchard) fruit and vegetable growing
is carried out on the settler house lots, has always been a characteristic
of FELDA planning procedures. Level to only gently sloping, well drained
land is essential for the village sites, and such areas are not easily
found on many FELDA schemes, which are exclusively on the sedentary soils
developed over the dissected peneplain topography of the interior.  Such



ANNEX 3
Page 2
terrain is normally rolling to hilly, with slopes in the 6-20° class and
the soils are more free drained and possess lower reserves of inherent
fertility than do the considerably richer types developed over the coastal
and riverine flats bordering the west coast of West Malaysia, where much
of the earlier smallholder and estate development took place in the first
half of the twentieth century.
5.        This rolling to hilly land, which seldom exceeds 300 feet in
elevation, and over which the amplitude of relief is almost always in the
range of 150 to 250 feet, is covered in its natural state by tropical rain
forest. Malaysian experience has shown that such land can be readily
adapted to tree crop cultivation on a sustained yield basis, provided that
a high standard of conservation farming is practiced. Such measures include
contour terracing or platform planting and the early establishment of a
thick ground cover, preferably leguminous, to reduce the incidence of
erosion in the early years of tree crop establishment, pending the develop-
ment of a full canopy which simulates the natural forest condition. The
quality of the soils are such that rubber can be grown almost everywhere
within this terrain group, but oil palm, which is more demanding in terms
of moisture requirements and which imposes a heavier plant nutrient drain
upon the soil, must necessarily be limited to a narrower range of soils.
Terrain constraints are also more serious in the case of oil palm, owing
to the much greater yield of crop per acre (about 10 times that of rubber)
which must be transported from the land, calling for an intricate road and
path system which is both difficult and expensive to construct and maintain
in the areas of steeper and more incised topography.
6.        The parts of the Johore Tenggara Region allocated to FELDA in
the master plan fall into the higher quality class which makes them suit-
able for oil palm, except for about 5,000 acres in the northern part of the
Tanjong Penggerang area where the conditions are only suitable for rubber.

JOHORE LAND SETTLEMENT PROJECT
Settler Incomes and Size of Holdings in a National Context
1.        The 14-acre size chosen for the oil palm holdings in the project
constitutes a reasonable compromise between the conflicting size require-
ments arising from income and employment considerations. With 14 acres
close to full employment is provided for one worker per family while the
income is slightly higher than the average for smallholders. A much
larger size (about 30 acres) would be required for full employment of the
settler and his family during the mature period, but would lead to a wide
gap between the incomes of FELDA oil palm settlers and targeted incomes
in the smallholder sector of about M$ 300 per month per family.
Income
2.        The incomes of FELDA oil palm settlers are expected to increase
from less than the average for smallholders, before joining FELDA, to
slightly above the average after the development period. The average
FELDA settler family income is about M$ 870 per year before joining the
scheme, versus about M$ 1,200 for the average smallholder family, and
increases to about M$ 3,800 not including off-farm income at the end of the
century, compared to about M$ 3,400 for the average smallholder assuming
a 3.5% annual growth rate family incomes 1/, and including off-farm income.
3.        A substantial portion of the income of smallholders outside the
project is derived from off-farm sources -- available data indicate that
the average proportion may be as high as 40% (see Table 1). A 14-acre
oil palm holding will require close to one full-time worker during the
mature period (including management tasks) leaving 0.5 to 1 worker per
average family free to earn additional income, if the opportunity exists.
If an off-farm income equal to 40% of the average smallholder income could
be earned by this extra family labor, a settler family income of about
M$ 5,000 would be attained at the end of the century, which is well above
the average sDallholder income target, about 35% of the projected average
national family income of that time. However, it is unlikely that a 40%
off-farm income can be earned in the smaller FELDA villages with their
limited employment opportunities. The possibility however, might arise
in Bukit Sening and Penggeli Timor/Sungai Sebol (with about 40% of the
1/   IBRD report No. 217-MA August 1973, Vol. 1, Annexes A & B.

settlers) at the end of the century (Annex 5) on balance. The income
targets at FELDA settlers appear reasonable given the risk element and the
personal transfer costs incurred in settlement.

JOHORE LAND SETTLEMENT PROJECT
Settlement Pattern and Economic Development in Johore Tenggara
1.        Village sizes in the proposed project differ from those in earlier
land settlement projects in Malaysia--the average size is larger and there
is a wider range of sizes. Average village sizes in the three Jengka Triangle
projects were 395, 435 and 440 settler families, respectively, versus 590
families in the proposed project (see Table 1). The sizes varied from
325 to 535 families in the Jengka projects--in the proposed project they
will vary from 265 to 1,255 families. The larger villages are expected
to attract a considerable amount of additional employment and will expand
into small towns of up to 10,000 inhabitants.
2.        The purpose of this annex is to analyze the reasons why a more
concentrated settlement pattern has been chosen for this project. The
employment effects of the project will also be discussed.
3.        In summary, it was found that the choice of larger settlement
sizes is an integral part of the urban development strategy for Johore
Tenggara -- a strategy that will help redirect urban growth from a few
large national cities to medium-sized towns (see paras 4-12). The choice
of larger settlements is consistent with the economic development policies
of the Government and will bring long-term benefits not only to the
settlers themselves but also to their dependents, who will face a broad
range of employment opportunities when the settlements reach maturity
(see paras 13-18). Furthermore, higher public service standards can be
provided in the project villages than in the traditionally smaller villages
(see paras 19-20). No reduction can be expected in per capita infrastructure
costs, however (see para 21).
Urban Structure
4.        In 1970 about 37% of the population of Peninsula Malaysia lived
in villages and towns with a population of 5,000 or more,compared with
31% in 1957. 1/ The corresponding figures for the state of Johore are
1/   The 1970 figure is adjusted for the population living in urbanized areas
contiguous with the largest cities but outside of their administrative
boundaries (see Urban connurbations - Population and households in ten
gazetted towns and their adjoining built-up areas, 1970 population and
Housing Census of Malaysia). Without this adjustment the percentage is
34. No adjustment of the 1957 figure has been made but the number of
people living in such adjoining urbanized areas in that year was probably
relatively small.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
rc.- =,'ectvely, That is, Johore is less urbanized than.
?eninsula Malaysia as a whole.
A more clear picture of urbanization trends is obtained by
a, the whole spectrum of settlement sizes -- see Table 2.  The
population living in large settlements with 50,000 persons or more increased
much more rapidly than the population as a whole, and so did small settle-
ments vith a population of 5 - 20,000. The 1957-70 growth rate of large
settlements was more than 100% and that of small ones about 50%, versus
an overall growth rate of some 40%. The number of people living in medium-
sized settlements, 20-50,000 persons, actually declined between 1957 and
1970, by about 25%. 11 As a result of this trend a larger and larger share
of the total population is living in the few big urban centers in Malaysia.
6.        Figure 1 further exemplifies this trend towards a concentration of
the urban population in large urban centers. 2/ From 1957 to 1970 the
distribution curve for Peninsula Malaysia flattened out for intermediate
settlement sizes, reflecting their decreasing share of the total population.
One also sees that the curve for Johore is relatively flat in the 10-50,000
size range because of the lack of settlements of this size.
7.        From the preceding it should not be concluded that rural-urban
migrants are moving directly to the largest urban centers. It is more
likely that step migration is taking place with the migrants first moving
to smaller settlements and then on to larger ones after some time, but
the details of this process are still unknown.  What is important here is,
however, the net effects which have been observed above.
8.        There are many public services and economic activities for which
a minimum population size is required if they are to be economically viable.
The thresholds for many of these activities are in the 15-20,000 population
range. Migrants desiring a wide range of public services and economic
opportunities therefore tend to gravitate towards centers with a population
above this threshold level. As there are very few centers of 15-50,000 per-
sons in Malaysia, the growth pattern discussed above is understandable. Of
the 11 states in Peninsula Malaysia 6 had no town of 15-20,000 persons in
1970, 7 had no town of 20-30,000, and 7 had no town of 30-50,000. Looking
at the whole 15-50,000 range there were 4 states without a single town.
1/   A similar picture is arrived at by analyzing the growth of individual
settlements. Those which had a population of 50,000 or more in 1957
expanded much faster than the population as a whole and those with a
population of 5 - 50,000 in 1957 grew much slower.
2/   Distribution curves of the kind shown in Figure 1 have the property of
being flatter the larger the total population of the country or region
is. They also tend to approach straight lines for large total populations.

Settlement Sizes in Johore Tenggara
9.        The larger settlement sizes in the proposed FELDA project are
part of an overall development strategy for Johore Tenggara which aims
atlcreating medium-sized growth centers with such a variety of employment
opportunities and with such levels of services that the present migration
flows to the larger cities could be reduced. The settlement structure
originally proposed in the Johore Tenggara Regional Master Plan consisted
of about 40 new centers, compared to the 24 now planned (see Table 3).
The merger of many small villages into a few large ones makes it feasible
to provide higher service levels than originally contemplated. Further-
mote, the unemployment problems which usually arise in settlements after
the development period should be alleviated. However, the physical
configuration of the agricultural area is such that some settlements will
have to be relatively small and scattered, if travel distances to work
are to be kept at a reasonable level, and some unemployment and outmigration
therefore has to be expected from these villages. It is hoped that such
outmigrants will move within the region to the larger settlements rather
than out of the region. The provision of a comprehensive set of public
services and economic opportunities in the urban hierarchy proposed for
the area should make it possible to achieve this goal.
10.       The FELDA project settlements will play important roles in the
proposed urban hierarchy.  The fourth largest of all new settlements is
FELDA's Bukit Sening which will have a population of close to 10,000 by
1990. Some 25% of the population and employment in the second largest
of the new towns-- Bandar Tenggara (see Map) with a planned total '990
population of about 17,000 -- will be generated by FELDA's Pengeli Timor/
Sungai Sebol settlement. The new town of Bandar Lebam is closely tied to
the proposed tourist development along the coast of the South China Sea
and is projected to have a population of 44,000 by 1990. Its growth is
also dependent on its role as a service center for the many surrounding
FELDA settlements.
11.       Mission estimates of the 1990 population of all the planned new
settlements in Johore Tenggara are shown in Table 3 together with estimates
of the population living in the eight FELDA project villages. The total
population will be about 166,000 which is about 40,000 less than the
es imate presented in the Johore Tenggara Regional Master Plan. The major
r son for this reduction in the projected population is the increased
s e of smallholdings which, with a given land area to be developed,
reduces the number of settlers. Also, the projections i- the Master Plan
appear overly optimistic with respect to the ability of the small settle-
ments proposed there to attract and keep migrants and jobs.
12.       The population of existing settlements in the region will also
increase substantially between 1970 and 1990, partly due to the land
development and its spillover effects. The populations of Kluang and Kota
Tinggi -- on the fringes of the development area (see Map) -- are expected
to increase from, respectively about 60,000 (including population in
immediately adjacent areas) and 8,000 in 1970 to some 180,000 and 20,000

by 1990.  Kluang is an important regional trade and service center and               0
a garrison town, which also has a strong base of manufacturing industries.
Kota Tinggi is a small market town and administrative center and lies at
the junction of the two project sub-regions.
Economic Development and Settlement Size
13.       There is a close correlation between urbanization and economic
development -- the higher a country's GNP per capita is, the more urbanized
it is.1/ There is little argumernt about the correlation but considerabie
controversy surrounds the qustion "what causes what?" Does urbanization
cause economic development, or vice versa? This is not the place to explore
this question in detail, however. Suffice it to say that urbanization
should be monitored and controlled, and that urbanization policies should
be closely integrated with economic development policies. 2/ This is what
is being done in Malaysia, and its extensive land development cum urban-
ization program-- of which Johore Tenggara is part-- reflects this. It should
be pointed out that Malaysia, considering its per capita income, appears
to be under-urbanized. 3/ Furthermore, the urban population in Peninsula
Malaysia is ethnically unbalanced -- only 20-25% of the urban population
is Malay whereas they constitute more than 50% of total population. One
of the purposes of the proposed project is to bring low-income rural
Malays into the high-income urban sector, in accordance with the Govern-
ment's New Economic Policy.
14.       Most high-income economic activities require a minimum local
population size-- as a local market and/or as a potential labor force with
varied skills-- and a well-developed economy which can provide the many
external services required by a specialized firm. The population thresh-
holds at which various economic activities become feasible have been
investigated in the Malaysian context, 4/ and the related employment structure
was also determined -- see Figure 2. 5/ The proportion of the population

employed in the primary sector (principally agriculture and related
processing activities) declines rapidly with increasing settlement size.
It appears that the structure shown in Figure 2 is fairly stable over time
(at least over 15-25 years) and that economic development and nation-wide
structural change take place through the growth of settlements and not
through a changing structure for each size. Figure 2 has been used to
estimate the employment situation in FELDA settlements by 1990.
Emnloyment Situation in FELDA Settlements by 1990
15.       The number of FELDA settlers, mill workers and administrators
is known for each village and there are also reliable estimates of the
number of additional households which will move into each village--
teachers, policemen, shop-keepers, etc. In Table 4 these estimates are
presented for three villages with "base" population of 400, 1,250 and
2,500 settler families. Assuming an average family size of 6 persons,
a labor force participation ratio of 0.35 and an unemployment rate of about
5%, by 1990, one can then estimate the total number of required jobs --
1,000, 3,100 and 12,000, respectively. These jobs can then be allocated
to the various sectors using (1) the normal employment structure, by
settlement size, in Figure 2, and (2) the fact that the number of primary
(FELDA) jobs are known.
16.       This analysis shows that in smaller settlements the number of
primary jobs by 1990 will be much lower than what is normal for settlements
05#          of these sizes.  For instance, the normal number of primary jobs in a settle-
ment of 3,000 persons (the 400-settler village) is 710 but in 1990 there will
be only 445 primary jobs in this settlement. This imbalance decreases
with the size of the settlement and disappears at a settlement size of
some 1,600 settler families.  By attracting additional primary jobs
(including manufacturing jobs which are independent of a local market)
a balance could be achieved by 1990. In the 400-settler village 265 such
jobs would be required, for instance.
17.       The reason behind the preceding is mainly that work requirements
on the FELDA oil palm schemes decline after the development period, to
slightly less than one full-time job per 14-acre holding (including some
management work), at the same time as the children of the settlers
enter the labor force. Small settlements have an initial population which
is too large to be fully employed later on without special measures. The
likely result is out-migration from the smaller settlements. These
migrants can, however, be absorbed by the economies of other and larger
settlements in the project region, because of the well-structured urban
hierarchy discussed earlier, and do not have to move to a major city.
Employment Effects of the Project
18.       One measure of the local long-term employment effect of the
proposed project can be obtained by assuming that each village adjusts to
the employment size and structure which is normal for the number of primary
jobs it has (i.e., a certain out-migration is assumed after the develop-
ment period). The resulting local employment multipliers are presented

Page 6
Tlae S9olumn  3.  They vary from 1.19 for the smallest village
uook AJai) to i.75 for the largest (Bukit Sening), averaging 1.43.
Zstima-es of the total employment multiplier for primary jobs in Malaysia
range zroa 2-0 to 2.6.  Assuming a value of 2.1 gives a total number
of jobs generatedi of about 10,200. That is, the direct long-term
employment effect is about 4,850 jobs, the indirect local employment effect
is about 2100 Jobs, and the indirect employment effect outside of the
villages is a3out 3,250 jobs. During the development period the project
is estimated to require an average of 6,000 workers.
Service Thresholds
19.       The fact that larger villages can support a wider range of
services than small villages can, was an important factor contributing to
the decision to increase settlement sizes in general in Johore Tenggara,
and FELDA settlement sizes in particular. There are many facilities which
require a minimum population size if they are to be efficiently utilized,
such as secondary schools and certain health equipment and personnel, and
which therefore cannot be provided in smaller villages. A settlement
size of about 500 settler families is the threshold for some of these
facilities and many settlers in the traditionally smaller FELDA
settlements have to travel from their home village to centrally located
service facilities.                                                                       0
20.       Table 6 presents the social services which will be provided in
the proposed project.  There are basically two service levels with the
three smallest settlements having a lower level than the five largest ones.
The smaller villages do not have a secondary school and the children will
have to travel to nearby larger villages. Furthermore, a community clinic
is provided in the smaller villages whereas the larger ones have a health
sub-center.   The clinic is staffed with one nurse.  It has no regular
visits by doctors but a mobile dispensary comes every two weeks. The
health sub-center is staffed with one nurse and one para-medic and is
regularly visited by a doctor.
Infrastructure Costs
21.       It has been suggested that a concentration of the settlers in
larger villages would substantially reduce per capita infrastructure costs --
that is, per capita capital and operating costs for water supply, roads,
etc. would decline with increasing village sizes. Most of the cost
reduction has been assumed to occur in the water supply sector because of
economies of scale in treatment plants and transmission lines. An analysis
of the cost data for the proposed proiect reveals that this is not likely
to be the case. For instance, water supply costs are relatively low
0

*          even with snall villages because several of them are usually integrated
into one large system with a common treatment facility. Some reduction
of,costs is likely but no reliable estimates can be made, and the amounts
involved will be small.

JOHORE LAND SETTLEMENT PROJECT
The Federal Land Development Authority
Background
1.        The Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA) was created under
the Land Development Ordinance of 1956 to carry out land development and
settlement projects.
2.        From 1957 to 1960, FELDA allocated Federal funds to State corpora-
tions and Land boards for federally approved land development schemes. In
the 15 schemes operated during the period, it exercised influence primarily
through its loan approving functions. However, it also experimented with
one direct management scheme with good results. Because of the difficulties
of coordinating the many State and Federal agencies involved in other
schemes overall progress on land development was slow. In 1960, new legis-
lation gave FELDA more control over land ownership and since then, FELDA
has been directly involved in planning and administration of land develop-
ment schemes. It has become the most important institutional instrument for
agriculture and rural development in Malaysia.
Settlement Schemes
3.        Traditional FELDA schemes cover 4,000-5,000 ac.  With the intro-
duction of urbanization into FELDA development schemes in 1972 (see Annex 5),
the size per scheme has increased up to a maximum of 7,000 ac. Rights to
the land are negotiated with the relevant state government. Premium and
rent charges are usually waived until the land comes into production.
Clearing, planting and early maintenance are performed under contract, and
settlers are brought in once the basic infrastructure has been completed,
generally in the fourth year. Settlers are chosen on the basis of such
criteria as age, experience, physical health, marital status and amount of
land previously owned (see Annex 10). They are employed on their own hold-
ing or in other jobs and are guaranteed a minimum subsistence allowance.
This and other development costs are charged to the settler's loan account.
Repayment begins about two years after the crop comes into production when
income, net of repayment of loan, is about M$ 125/month. Repayment is
deducted from the value of produce, which must be sold through the Authority.
The total loan which the settler must repay, including interest at 6-1/4%
for a 14 ac oil palm holding, is about M$ 19,500. The cost of settlement
per family, excluding social costs (roads, water supply and public buildings)
would be US$14,100, net of contingencies. Including social cost it would
amount to US$16,330.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
-i'ia ?YLo7)4 pLanting target for the Second Malaysia Plan (SMP) was
Lnitia1lV set at 275,000 ac (55,000 ac/year).  While there has been a delay
_n the first year, planting has accelerated and it is expected that about
125,000 ac more than originally targeted will be planted by the end of the
Plan. In 1975, on termination of the SMP, FELDA clearing and planting
operations for rubber and oil palm are projected to be reduced to about
50,000-60,000 ac yearly while other organizations like RISDA are expected
to carry a heavier load of land development.
5.        Output of FELDA palm oil, which was comparatively small during
the 1960's when most of the planted area was still immature, is expected
to increase by about 24% yearly from 1971 to 1985. Of the total Malaysian
supply of palm oil in 1985, FELDA output is expected to account for about
one-third. Past achievements and expected future developments of FELDA's
oil palm and rubber development are indicated in the table in this Annex.
6.        By the end of 1973, FELDA had 11 palm oil mills with a total
capacity of 344 tons ffb/hour in operation. Sixteen additional oil palm
mills with a total capacity of 693 tons ffb/hour are to be constructed
during the remainder of the decade. Their capacity, together with an
extension in capacity of the existing mills, will raise total FELDA oil
mill capacity to about 1,100 tons ffb/hour by 1980/81. For the export
of palm oil in bulk, FELDA is constructing or expanding facilities at
Port Klang, Tanjong Gelang (Kuantan) and Pasir Gudang. Total capacity of
these installations is expected to be 75,000 tons by 1976. At the end of
1973, three rubber factories with a total capacity of 90 tons/day were in
operation.  Capacity expansion is not envisaged since Government decided
that rubber processing of non-private rubber development should be the
responsibility of the Malaysian Rubber Development Corporation (MRDC).
7.        The expansion of physical plant and land development was accom-
panied by an expansion of public amenities. The following table shows
the achievements until the end of 1972;
Access road (mi)                     337
Village roads (mi)                   550
Water supply to villages              77
Schools (primary/secondary)           73
Clinics                               68
Community centers                     76
Public playgrounds                    29
Public telephones                     46
Postal agencies                       60
Police posts                          38
8.        Despite these achievements, FELDA's progress has not been entirely
satisfactory. This is particularly noticeable in delays in settler intake.
These were partly caused by delays in preparatory work, such as the provision
of roads and housing, which resulted from contract delays rising out of:
(a) the employment of less experienced contractors in an attempt to achieve
a more balanced ethnic distribution of contracts (most of the contractors



,ANNEX 6
Page 3
O         are Chinese); (b) difficulties in obtaining timber supplies for house con-
struction; and (c) contractors finding it difficult to recruit skilled
workers in the more remote locations into which FELDA has moved to an
increasing degree. Part of the delay was also due tg unrealistic planning,
assuming that settlers would move on to schemes about one year after plant-
ing. Experience has showun that this is not possible with such a large
infrastructure program and the target time has now been extended to 18 months.
9.        In the past, there have also been problems on social aspects of
thedschemes because there was little involvement of settlers in scheme ad-
mir4stration and there was a lack of alternative employment opportunities.
A Settler Development Division which was formed in 1972 is improving the
social situation and FELDA management is setting aside land on schemes to
be managed on an estate basis to supply additional employment opportunities.
The increased size of villages (see Annex 5) should also provide alternative,
non-agricultural employment opportunities.
Organization and Management of FELDA Headquarters
10.       FELDA operates as a quasi-autonomous government agency under the
Ministry of National and Rural Development. It is given wide autonomy for
day to day administration. Operating policy is set and overall supervision
handled by a Board consisting of 12 members, which includes representatives
of the public and private sectors. The Director General, FELDA's chief
executive, is a member of the Board.  He has been in this post since 1965
*         and is a career civil servant.
11.       FELDA's organization has been modified over the last two years
to adjust to its expanding responsibilities. One of the major objectives
is decentralization. The present structure, which was introduced in July
1973, is shown in the chart. This structure is a modification of the
recommendations of a reorganization study conducted by a consulting firm,
Public Administrative Service (PAS) of Chicago. That study proposed to
install only one Deputy Director-General, namely for field administration.
However, after one year of operation under the originally proposed structure,
it turned out that the supervisory function left to the Director-General,
which included everything except those areas of responsibilities left to
field administration (as indicated in the chart), was too heavy. Conse-
que4tly, and rightly in the mission's opinion, another Deputy Director
General post for technical services was established to ease the workload
on the Director General.
12.       The main features of the organization and management structure
are:
(a) the Director General of FELDA is the main executive officer
rather than as in the past the Chairman of the Board. He
is accountable to the Chairman of the Board regarding matter3
of administrative management and to the Board for the overall
conduct of FELDA affairs. His main functions include planning
and supervising departmental operations, directing the pre-
0                   paration of long range plans and maintaining liaison with



ANNEX 6
Page 4
external agencies and the general public. The directors for
finance, marketing, management services, and research report
directly to him;
(b) the Deputy Director-General for Field Administration has the
responsibility of supervising and coordinating all agricul-
tural and social services at headquarters and the area con-
trollers' offices in the field;
(c) the Deputy Director-General for Technical Services has the
responsibility of supervising and coordinating activities of
the Budget and Planning, and Projects, and the Processing
Departments;
(d) the Budget and Planning Department analyzes and approves
budget proposals submitted by the area controllers through
the Field Administration Department and formulates future
policies and plans. It schedules and conducts budget hear-
ings and develops and administers internal operating and
control procedures;
(e) the Processing Department manages directly all industrial
plant and equipment while the Project Department does the
same for all agricultural plant and equipment;
(f) the Finance Department has authority over the accounts,
treasury, systems and pre-audit division.  It plans,
organizes and directs the activities of these divisions.
One of its major functions is the collection and analysis
of fiscal, budget and cost control reports;
(g) the Management Services Department is responsible for staff-
ing and training, and general services and coordinates
procurement with engineering; and
(h) the Marketing Department is responsible for the marketing
of rubber, palm oil and kernels, and auxiliary products.
It performs promotional services and hedging actions to
cover market fluctuation risks, provides advice on quality
control and carries out a wide range of market analyses.
13.       In 1972, a new FELDA subsidiary, the FELDA Stores Corporation
(FSC) was established and took over the retailing activities handled
previously by the FELDA Shops Division. Fifty-one percent of the equity
in FSC is retained by FELDA and the balance is for issue to settler coop-
eratives. The FSC is administered by a Board under a separate constitu-
tion and employees are directly employed by the FSC. The Director-General
of FELDA is the Chairman of the FSC. For early 1974, it is planned to
form a FELDA Marketing Corporation along the lines established for the FSC.
The advantage of such an organization, which would have private company
status, would be that it would not be accountable to Government agencies



ANNEX 6
Page 5
and thereby guarantee a certain confidentiality in customer-seller relation-
ships which is necessary in marketing. Further, salaries of the Corporation
would not be subject to Government salary scales which would enable the
Corporation to pay salaries competitive with private industry. Assurances
will be sought during negotiations that the Bank will be afforded an adequate
opportunity to comment on the by-laws of the FELDA Marketing Corporation
before it is established.
Staffing and Training
14.       At the end of 1972, FELDA had a staff of 3,223 allocated as
follows:
Executive, administrative and professional             423
Supervisory, clerical, fiscal and stores               714
Field operations and research                       1,523
Mill operation and maintenance                         421
Custodial, building, maintenance and labor             142
3,223
This staff (excluding labor) is quite young, the average age being 33 with
90% of staff members under 40. Required expansion of the staff is supported
by a vigorous training program. FELDA will need about 120 area and scheme
managers and assistant managers by 1975. It is now recruiting yearly about
30 graduates of the Serdang School of Agriculture, who receive one year
of training as assistant scheme managers before becoming scheme managers.
15.       A separate training division is responsible for training of FELDA
staff and settlers. The formal staff training is carried out at five
training schools and two centers where a one-year introductory course in
field practices and general administration is given to trainee field assis-
tants. In addition, in-service training courses are run at the two centers.
16.       The 1972 intake amounted to 380 trainees, which is the largest
annual intake to date. After allowing for a drop out rate of 5%, the
out-turn in 1973 should be sufficient to meet the demand for field assis-
tants on the 100,000 ac of new land development scheduled for this year,
at the rate of one field assistant to each 500 ac, and also provide replace-
ments to fill vacancies on existing schemes caused by resignations, promo-
tions, and staff retirements. The out-turn is likely to reamin at this
level at least for the next year or two. The course includes four months'
theoretical instruction in both rubber and oil palm, followed by a one-month
settler development and scheme administration period of classroom instruc-
tion, and finishes with three months of practical instruction on a neigh-
boring FELDA scheme.
17.       Each school has a permanent staff of two and each center has three
agricultural diploma holders, while instructional support is given by FEvLDA
regional offices and scheme staff.
.



ANNEX 6
Page 6
18.       In-service staff training courses are usually between two or
three days and two weeks in duration, and cover a variety of specialized
subjects such as oil palm nursery operation or are designed as refresher
courses intended to acquaint the staff with new techniques.
19.       Settler training is given on the schemes and commences as on-the-
job instruction imparted by the scheme management staff from the moment
the settlers take over the maintenance of the crop from the planting con-
tractors. Settlers on rubber schemes are also given an intensive six months'
course on tapping a few months before their lots are ready for opening.
The cource, which is attended by every settler, includes lectures and
demonstrations presented with the aid of Rubber Research Institute exten-
sion service staff, and practical experience gained on the tree in an area
of land designated as a training area.
20.       In the case of oil palm schemes, where 20 settlers working as
a group under an elected leader are jointly responsible for the harvesting
of their fruits, the block leaders are given a one week course in the
operation of the system one month before the system is introduced at the
start of the fourth year in harvest. Prior to this, the settlers and their
dependants carry out their maintenance and harvesting tasks under the direct
supervision of the FELDA field staff, during which time particular attention
is given to euxplaining the how and why of the several specialized tasks -
weeding, polinating, pruning, manuring, and harvesting especially - all of
which are so important to the optimum growth and yield of the palms.
Finances
21.       The main sources of finance for FELDA are:  Federal Government
budget allocations; IBRD loans for the three Jengka projects (US$52 million)
and an Asian Development Bank loan of US$8.4 million for the construction
of two palm oil mills.
22.       Government budget allocations are made annually to FELDA:
(a) as loans for relending to settlers to cover the cost of
agricultural development, housing, house lots and settler
subsistence, bearing nominal interest of 5-1/2% with re-
payment periods of 25 years including a grade period of
ten years on principal repayments. During this grace
period, no interest is charged during the first five years
and only simple interest of 5-1/2% during the remaining
five years. These procedures reduce the nominal rate of
5-1/2% to a weighted average rate of interest of 3.8%.
The total of Government loans received by the end of 1972
was M$ 376.3 million, of which M$ 75 million was received
in 1972. Loan repayments by the end of 1972 amounted to
M$ 4.6 million, of which M$ 2.3 million was interest; and
(b) as grants for FELDA's administrative expenses, which are
budgeted at M$ 25 million in 1972.  A total of M$ 136.9 mil-
lion has been received so far.



ANNEX 6
Page 7
23.       Up to the present, FELDA has never experienced budgetary con-
straints, and as far as can be seen, this situation should prevail in the
future given Government's priority to land settlement schemes and its
favorable budgetary position.
24.       Recently, FELDA submitted to Government a plan to reduce loan
repayments made by its rubber smallholders. This proposal has been made
in view of rubber price declines on the world market during the 1960's,
which have made it more difficult or impossible for many smallholders to
repay their loans in full. The proposed basis for repayment is a fixed
amount per acre per year which would increase with the size of the holding
and a reduction in the interest for settlers' loans from 6-1/4% to 4%.
This system would permit net annual family incomes of M$ 125 a month,
assuming a cif first quality rubber price of M$ 0.44/lb. However, with
the revaluation of the Malaysian dollar and no corresponding increase in
rubber price projections, the long-term rubber price is more likely to
be M$ 0.40/lb. This would not make the M$ 125/month income target feas-
ible. The situation is presently being reviewed by Government and FELDA.
25.       Agricultural development costs such as land clearing, planting
and initial upkeep as well as housing and office construction costs are
fairly well standardized. Cost for this item, have been increasing, but
not as much as the costs of road construction, village site preparation,
water supply and most importantly, general administration. No exact
figures can be given until the new data collection and accounting systems
are installed and have been in operation for at least six months, i.e., by
early 1974.
Accounts and Audit
26.       FELDA's accounts are of two main types:  grant and loan, cor-
responding to the two types of financing it receives from Government
(para 21). Up to now administrative accounts have been consolidated for
the whole of FELDA, but in future accounts will be kept at both individual
scheme and headquarter levels. The loan account is a consolidation of all
costs charged to schemes. Separate accounts are kept for each scheme.
27.       FELDA's accounting organization and procedures failed to keep
pace with its rapid expansion and diversification, and for this reason
FELDA appointed the firm of Public Administrative Services (PAS) of
Chicago to carry out a study of its general and financial administration.
Based on PAS's recommendations, and those of the UNDP-recruited temporary
financial director, the Finance Department has been reorganized.
28.       Within the Finance Department, and under the new arrangement,
the Treasurer will be responsible for keeping a strict cash control,
register cash movements, and forecast cash inflows and outflows based on
operations and on recommended short-term cash investments. The Treasurer
began making four-month cash flow projections in September 1972.
0



ANNEX 6
Page 8
29.       The Systems Division within the Finance Department has responsibil-
ity for field accounting; introducing accounting procedures adapted to
computers; and training staff in accounting and bookkeeping.
30.       The Operations Division within the Finance Department pre-audits
and controls accounts. It has begun data processing programming and is
revising its financial management system. It is responsible for financial
planning and for originating financial policy recommendations to the Director
General.
31.       The main problems of the Finance Department are:
(a) inadequate staff - a more vigorous recruitment and training
effort has to be made, especially of accountants and systems
analysts, and of area controllers and managers, to permit
further decentralization of account processing;
(b) new accounting systems have to be devised for new operations,
such as the recently started sugar cane complex; and
(c) inventory control requires additional training of staff at
lower levels.
32.       The computerized financial control system, as designed by PAS, is
now being implemented. Operations of the payroll and settler accounts are
successful, but the final results of the computer analysis of the 1972 finan-
cial statements, including those for the Jengka projects, which were
scheduled to be finalized by June 1973, will be delayed by four to five
months. The major reasons for this delay are difficulties in balancing
1972 accounts and the considerable "debugging" operations which were ex-
perienced. The experiences gained so far indicate that the new system
will be of great value in streamlining FELDA financial operations. In
particular, it will force all departments not only to provide more accurate
data collection and compilation, but it demands a high degree of coordina-
tion among the various departments involved in the financial reporting
system, a coordination which has been missing in the past. However, al-
though there is every indication that the introduction of the new system
is going to be successful, the final proof will not be obtained until the
1972 financial statements Rare out, i.e., in October/November of 1973. It
will take about another month before the accounts are audited. If the
system fails, FELDA's financial organization will be in severe trouble,
since the previous manual system has been discontinued and cannot be
reinstated at short notice. Because of this, it will be prudent to insist
on audited 1972 accounts for the Jengka projects, and this would be made a
condition of effectiveness.
Size of Settler Holding
33.       In the 17 years since FELDA became operational, the house lot has
remained at a quarter acre, but there has been a progressive increase in the
size of the agricultural plot allocated to settlers.  On the earliest schemes,
these plots, 6 ac in extent, were all planted to rubber, while an additional          0



ANNEX 6
Page 9
2 ac plot, intended for dusun (orchard) development was set aside in a
separate part of these early schemes. Eventually, the dusun lots were
planted to rubber, thus raising the area of commercial crop per settler to
8 ac. In the mid-sixties, this figure was further raised to 10 ac, as in
the case of the Jengka Triangle Projects.
34.       The first oil palm schemes, started in the early sixties, began
*          with 8 ac and were later increased to 10 ac by the planting of the dusun
reserves to oil palm, analogous to the early rubber schemes. Subsequently,
10 ac unit holdings were allocated to oil palm settlers, including those
in the Jengka Triangle Projects.
35.       More recently, after reviewing the income and employment status
of FELDA settlers, the Government of Malaysia has increased the land alloca-
tions for settlers on all new schemes to 12 and 14 ac for rubber and oil
palm holdings respectively. This further increase, which aims to provide
a fuller measure of employment for the settler and his family and to increase
his income after repayment to a level commensurate with that in the urban
sector, is in compliance with the NEP, which aims at reducing the income
disparity between rural and urban occupations.
36.       At a projected rubber price in constant 1972/73 terms of a 12 ac
FELDA rubber holding would ensure an average yearly net income during the
loan repayment period of about M$ 1,500 net of loan repayments and M$ 3,800
for the remaining 10 years of project life after loan repayment. The
*         holding will provide two full-time jobs for the settler and his family at
maturity.  Such an income level will constitute an improvement on the 10 ac
holdings allocated to settlers on FELDA schemes established in the past,
but even at this improved level, it will be below the income levels attained
by other smallholders with two fully employed members.
37.       Oil palm settlers with 14 ac holdings will earn net average
yearly incomes of M$ 3,200 net of loan repayments during the loan repayment
period and M$ 3,800 during the remaining seven years of project life after
loan repayments. Employment needs of the family are, however, not so well
satisfied in spite of the larger holding and the provision of alternate
employment opportunities will continue to be a more pressing problem on
FELDA oil palm schemes as the younger members of the settler families
reach working age.

JOHORE LAND SETTLEMENT PROJECT
The Johore Tenggara Regional Master Plan
1.        During the course of the First Malaysia Plan (1966-1970) the
Government of Malaysia undertook a comprehensive analysis of the natural
resources and land use situation in Peninsula Malaysia, as an aid to
planning for the optimum usage of these resources over the medium- and
long-term. Several large areas of undeveloped land with considerable
potentials for development were identified in various parts of the
country including the Johore Tenggara Region situated in the southeastern
corner of the Peninsula Malaysia.
2.        This region, with extensive areas of good soil was found to
have an especially promising potential for agricultural development,
together with considerable commercial forestry opportunities. Other
areas were considered worthy of preservation in their natural state,
either as wildlife and nature preservation - cum-recreation reserves, in
which case they would also serve a vital watershed conservation role; or,
as in the case of a stretch of scenically attractive coastline fringed
with good beaches and clear water, for carefully controlled development
as a major tourist resort. Some possibilities for mining, mainly of
tin and aluminum ores, were also identified.
3.        The overall quality of these resources combined with the close
proximity of the region to the main developed areas of south and south-
western Johore, with their well developed access and other infrastructures,
caused the Government of Malaysia to declare the region a high priority
area for development commencing in the Second Malaysia Plan.
4.        A consortium of British planning consultants, led by Hunting
Technical Services, was accordingly commissioned to survey and study the
area in greater depth and to draw up a plan for progressive development
of the region. The resultant master plan was completed in 1971, after
two years study which included soil and terrain surveys and forest
inventories, and intensive hydrological, ecological and geological studies
of a number of carefully selected sites. The physical resource studies
were complemented by a sociological study which included field surveys of
Malay farmers, who were expected to comprise the greater portion of the
new settlement population.
5.        The above information, together with economic data mainly from
official sources, provided the background against which the economic and
social development master plan was prepared and is now being implemented.
Provision is made for: (a) the clearing of 281,000 acres of forest and
the development of 250,000 (net) acres of oil palm, rubber and other



ANNEX 7
Page 2
agricultural crops, including 5,000 acres dairy and beef industry schemes,
giving employment to about 14,000 families4; (b) the establishment of an
integrated logging and timber processing complex based on 92,000 acres
of rain forest being cleared at an annual rate of 6,000 acres per year
between 1974 and 1989; (c) the creation of a tourist complex in an area
of scenically attractive coastline which may be handling 50,000 overnight
visitors at full development and offering direct employment to 20,000
persons; (d) the conservation under forest of all land with an average
slope greater than 200 and other land with soils unsuitable for agriculture,
together with reservoir catchments needed to ensure regularity of water
supplies, and the establishment of several strict nature reserves for
preservation of distinct biological communities of special scientific or
aesthetic interest.
6.        Between 20 and 30 new villages, two new towns, one of which will
be the new tourism center, and expansion schemes for the existing towns
of Kluang and Kota Tinggi are included in the master plan. They are
sufficient to accommodate over 400,000 people by 1990, and are served by
a new regional road system.
7.        A Johore Tenggara Development Authority (Lembaga Kemajuan Johore
Tenggara, or LKJT) which is a joint State and Central Government statutory
body, has been created to control and coordinate the development activities.
8.        Feasibility studies of the integrated logging and timber
processing project and the dairy farm project mentioned below, together
with a package program for development of about 75,000 acres for FELDA
development during the Second Malaysia Plan, were included in the master
plan documents. The document covering this last project constituted the
preparation report for the present appraisal.
9.        Progress in implementing the master plan is satisfactory,
including the phased development of the primary road access into the main
area of FELDA development, any delay in construction of which could
seriously interfere with, or even delay, the successful completion of the
FELDA land development and settlement program.
10.       The overall master plan is expected to give a rate of return
to the economy of 17%. It will have favorable effects on employment,
income distribution and economic growth. Total public sector development
expenditure for agricultural development, roads and bridges, water
supplies, posts and telecommunications, schools, health and other social
services during the 20-year period from 1971-90 will be about M$ 640
million.
11.       In addition to the FELDA project, developments scheduled under
the SMP in the master plan region include:
(a) a 13,400 acre smallholder oil palm land development
program, which is being undertaken by the SEDC at four
sites;
.



ANNEX 7
Page 3
(b) a 3,300 acre site which is being subdivided for allocation
to private concerns operating on a joint venture basis
and developing a variety of diversification crop projects
including a franchise poultry operation and an orchid
farm, and possibly also cocoa, tapioca, ginger, soya bean,
and eel pond enterprises;
(c) a 4,300 acre Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development
Institute (MARDI) research station, of which 1,700 acres
will be opened up during the SNP (see Annex 1);
(d) a 5,400 acre dairy industry scheme which will be run by the
National Livestock Authority (USAHAIWAN). Only 2,500 acres
are scheduled for development in the SMP;
(e) a 5,500 acres beef cattle industry project which is likely
to be a joint venture project between the authority and
a foreign group with expertize in this field;
(f) the 92,000 acre joint venture integrated timber industry
project, involving the SEDC and a foreign group, referred
to above;
(g)  a first phase development of the tourism project, which
will include the opening of day visitor facilities in 1974
and the construction of a hotel which is likely to be
operated on a joint venture basis between the authority
and a private sector, for which negotiations are currently
underway; and
(h) a wide range of infrastructural construction projects
including completion of the Penggarang Highway in 1974,
and a M$ 0.5 million bridge over the Sungei Sayong which
will provide access to the new town of Bandar Tenggara.

JOHORE LAND SETTLEMENT PROJECT
Settler Selection Criteria and Legal Status
Settlement Procedures
1.        FELDA schemes are intended mainly for rural people who either
possess no land or have insufficient land to obtain an adequate standard
of living. Settlement procedures would be similar to those practiced
under the Jengka projects.
2.        The Federal Government stipulates that 20% of places in all
FELDA schemes will be available to ex-members of the security forces
possessing the minimum qualifications. The States require that 50% of
the settlers (other than ex-servicemen) should be from the State where
the development takes place, provided prospective settlers possess the
minimum qualifications.
3.        Selection is in two stages.  First, applicants are interviewed
in their home districts throughout Malaysia by FELDA staff and local
officials who know the district and its people.  At this stage the candi-
dates' general suitability is determined and the basic minimum criteria
for selection applied. These are that the candidate:
(a) is a Malaysian citizen;
(b) is married;
(c) has no serious criminal record;
(d) is physically and mentally fit;
(e) is prepared to abide by the rules and regulations established
by FELDA;
(f) has less than two acres of land; and
(g)  is over 18 and under 35 (formerly over 21 and
under 45); ex-servicemen and policemen up to
40 years of age.
4.        Following the interview, points are awarded to each candidate,
up to a maximum of 30, on the following scales:

Animal husbandry                                   1
5.        The final selection is made by FELDA Headquarters on the above                   0
points system and on the required allotment of places to servicemen.
6.        Development Period.  On arrival at a scheme - some 2.5 years after
clearing - the settler signs the first part of the settlers' agreement.
This provides that in return for being permitted to settle on the scheme,
the settler works under the direction of FELDA on the development of the
scheme. The settler is paid a minimum of M$ 2.90 per day, about M$ 70 a
month, for his work and if no work is available, he receives a subsistence
loan at the same rate. The settler is required to abide by all rules and
regulations of the Authority and if he breaks them, or if he is considered
unsuitable in conduct, he may be required to leave the scheme.
7.        Post Development Period.  At the end of the 6th year after
clearing the settler, assuming his performance is satisfactory, signs the
second part of his agreement - the Supplement Agreement. This changes the
status of the settler from, in effect, an employee of the Authority to that
of a smallholder. He is registered as an occupier in expectation of title of
approximately 14 acres of oil palm and a 1/4 acre house lot. In the case
of oil palm, because it is not practical to cultivate oil palms initially
as smallholdings under the FELDA system, he is not allocated a specific
area, but is assigned to a group of 20 to maintain and harvest a 280 acre
block. Once the settler has paid off his loan (Annex 11) the Authority
.



AN4EX 10
Page 3
will recormend to the State Government that the State alienate to the
settler the house lot, on a 99-year lease. The 14 ac oil palm will
be alienated to a cooperative society of which the settler is a member.
8.        During the period when any loan repayments or charges are due by
the settler to FELDA or the State, the area is managed and administered by
FELDA. At all times the settler is required to sell all ffb to mills speci-
fied bv FELDA for which he shall receive the average price received by
FELDA over the preceding three months after deducting transport, processing,
distribution, mill amortization and upkeep costs and a replanting reserve
charge (Annex 11, Table 5).
9.        Under the First Jengka Project Loan 533-IA, it was also provided
that Jengka settlers would bear the project headquarters and scheme manage-
ments costs during the development and operating periods. This arrangement
has since been altered and FFLDA and the Government have introduced new
arrangements. Recovery of FELDA's administration costs from settlers is
related to the f.o.b. price. For palm oil, no costs are charged if the
f.o.b. prices is below M$ 439/ton since at that price the settler's
income would be below M$ 3,600/year which is the minimum income level set
by Government. The table in this Annex indicates the relationship between
f.o.b. prices and management fees charged to the settler.
10.       Settlers Loans.  A loan account would be opened for each settler
which would be charged with the cost of his house, includin2 clearing the
house lot, and of developing 14 ac of oil palms.  At the end of the fifth
year, settlers would be issued with a statement showing the amount of the
loan and the repayment due. The statements would also include any loans
for tools, etc.
11.       Interest would be charged at 6-1/4% on the loan and would be
capitalized over the development period. This is lower than commercial
rates and it reflects Government's desire to provide settlers with reason-
able income oDportunities.
12.       Loans would be repaid by equal annual installments of principal
and interest over a period of 15 years commencing on the first day of the
sixth year. Loan repayments would be deducted at source from payments
made by the FELDA-owned and operated mills to settlers for their production.
The costs of fertilizers and other inputs would also be recovered in this
way.

Economic Return
1.        Benefits. Yield estimates are based on experience with schemes
of similar soils and topography, and are about 10% lower than yield estimates
for the Third Jengka Triangle Project.
2.        The ex-mill price of palm oil is based on a price projection
of US$197/ton cif Europe in constant 1973 dollars, which represents the
lower end of the range (US$197/220) of Bank price projections for palm oil.
The ex-mill price for palm kernels is based on the projected price of
M$ 236/ton in constant 1973 dollars.
3.        Costs. Total development costs include a 5% physical contingency,
based on experience gained in the Jengka projects.
4.        Costs of water supply, school and health center constructions
were excluded from costs on the grounds that their benefits are excluded
and would at least equal costs.
5.        All costs except settler labor were valued at market prices.
For the economic rate of return, a shadow wage for labor at M$ 2.90/day
was applied. This is about equivalent to the laborer's foregone income
before joining the scheme, and is also the contractual wage rate FELDA pays
to settlers during the development period. The wage rate FELDA currently
pays to casual laborers, and which is representative of wages for unskilled
labor in the project area is N$ 3.50/day. The use of a constant value for
the calculation of the economic rate of return implies that through the
life of the project there will remain segments of the rural population in
economic circumstances similar to present FELDA entrants. The economic rate
of return thus calculated is 14.8%. With the higher projected palm oil
price (US$220/ton) and the same cost assumptions, the rate of return would
16.8%.
6.        The rate of return was also calculated without shadow wage rates
and assuming an increase in real wages by 3% yearly starting with a base of
M$ 3.50/day in 1973. The rate of return thus calculated is 13.51 at the
lower projected price and 15.5% with the higher projected price for palm oil.
7.        Except for the part obtained by the Government, most of the
benefits of the project accrues to settlers whose present and expected
future incomes are well below average Malaysian incomes. The distributional
impact of the project is therefore clearly favorable.
