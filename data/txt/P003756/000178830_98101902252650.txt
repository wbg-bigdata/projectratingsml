INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN ro THE REPUBLIC
OF INDONESIA FOR A NATIONAL RESOURCE SURVEY AND MAPPING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of US$13 million
to help finance the National Resource Survey and Mapping Project. The
loan would have a term of 20 years, including six years of grace, with
interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report on Indonesia "Indonesia:    Development
Prospects and Needs" of April 15, 1975 (708-IND) described and analyzed
the structure of production and incomes, the recent changes in the avail-
ability of resources, and the medium and longer-term outlook for the
Indonesian economy. Country data are shown in Annex 1.
3.        In 1969, at the start of Indonesia's First Five-Year Plan,
the per capita income of the Indonesian population was probably no higher
than half a century ago. A majority of the population lived below a
minimum welfare standard, especially on Java. Most were dependent exclu-
sively or primarily on agriculture, where farms were generally very small.
Under-employment was widespread. While the inflation of the mid-1960s had
been overcome, infrastructure was still in very poor condition.
4.        The Government's efforts during the First Five-Year Plan period
(April 1, 1969 - March 31, 1974) were successful in putting the economy
on the road towards development. Most physical objectives were achieved
or nearly so, and there was very substantial rehabilitation of run-down
infrastructure and government enterprises in agriculture and manufacturing.
Investments increased at a very fast rate, rising from 9 to 19 percent of
GNP. While 57 percent of Government development expenditures were financed
from abroad, the reliance on foreign financing was much smaller than the
level rate of nearly 80 percent foreseen in the Plan. Real GDP increased
at an annual rate of over 7 percent. GNP per capita in current prices
reached about $125 1/ in 1973. The Government instituted programs for the
labor intensive rehabilitation of infrastructure and other programs which
created substantial incomes and employment. In all, however, given the
annual increase in the labor force of about one million, one cannot be
confident that the employment situation improved during the First Plan
period, and from available information it is difficult to judge the extent
to which the poorest section of the population shared in the gains of
development.
5.        The Second Five-Year Plan (April 1, 1974 to March 31, 1979) builds
on the achievements of the First Plan. While the First Plan dealt mainly
1/   $130 on World Bank Atlas basis.

- 2 -
with the urgent needs for stabilization and rehabilitation under conditions
of great scarcity of resources, progress has been such that the Second Plan
can give much more weight to such problems as employment, equitable distri-
bution, regional growth and education. The Plan identifies a number of
specific low-income target groups and, in general, adopts an employment-
oriented development strategy. It aims at a continued growth in investments,
needed both because capital intensity will tend to increase as the rehabil-
itation phase draws to an end, and because more socially-oriented investments
will be made. Overall, the Plan expects GDP to grow at 7.5 percent per
annum.
6.        Over the decade 1961-71, Indonesia's population grew by 2.1
percent a year. However, as a result of changes in the age, distribution
and declining mortality, the current growth rate is estimated at 2.5
percent. Even under the most optimistic assumptions with regard to fertility
decline, the growth rate would only come down gradually, and the population
would nearly double by the end of the century. While Indonesia still has
substantial unutilized land reserves in the Outer Islands, these are
limited in relation to the expected population increase, and a further
large increase in population pressures - already severe on the Inner
Islands - must be expected. Since 1969, the Government has been operating
and gradually extending a family planning program.    The number of acceptors
has been increasing rapidly. The Second Five-Year Plan foresees a much
more comprehensive attack on the population problem.
7.        During the years 1976-79, average annual additions to the labor
force are estimated at 1.2 million, increasing to more than 1.4 million in
the years 1980-85. In addition, substantial underemployment exists, and
there is the risk that even relatively simple technological improvements
may adversely affect existing employment. The Second Plan's projections
show that employment growth would almost keep up with the growth in the
labor force, and even this may be too optimistic. Thus, the employment
thrust of the Plan needs to be further strengthened if an appreciable
increase in real labor earnings - and a wider spread of the benefits of
development - is to be attained.
8.        Towards the end of 1973, when the Second Plan was being finalized,
prospects for resource availability improved dramatically. In line with
other OPEC countries the Government raised the export price of oil in
successive stages from $3.70 per barrel in April 1973 to $12.60 per barrel
in July 1974. Early in 1974 (and again in 1975) the Government also
successfully renegotiated the contracts with foreign oil companies, enabling
it to retain a greater share of the oil income.    As a result, the net
contribution of the oil sector to the balance of payments and Government
revenues was expected to increase very considerably; a large increase
in foreign exchange reserves and a budget surplus were anticipated for
1974/75. 1/
1/   Indonesian fiscal year April 1, 1974 - March 31, 1975.



- 3 -
9.        By October 1974, foreign exchange reserves hal risen by $650
million from their level at the beginning of 1974/75 and Government revenues
were exceeding the levels originally estimated. The Government authorized
much higher levels of expenditures, mainly for development, which reflected
the improved revenue prospects. However, the recessionary conditions in
the industrial countries began to affect the volume of iil exports and
production by the middle of the year. Indonesia's high quality oil tended
to become overpriced 1/ as world oil demand slackened and output declined
from an averge of 1.45 million bpd (barrels per day) in the first half of
1974 to 1.31 million bpd in the second half. Proceeds from non-oil exports
also started to decline as prices, and sometimes export quantities, fell.
10.       In October 1974 also, the first signs appeared of what turned out
to be a substantial financial overextension by PERTAMINA, the national oil
company. PERTAMINA had undertaken a large and diversified investment program
financed to a substantial extent by short-term borrowing. In the third
quarter of 1974/75 it started withholding part of the corporate oil tax it
had collected on behalf of Government from the foreign oil companies; by the
end of the fiscal year a total of Rp 346 billion ($830 million) had been so
withheld and used to meet PERTAMINA's financial obligations. Early in 1975
PERTAMINA failed to meet payments due to some foreign banks, and the Government
stepped in and took decisive action. It banned all independent foreign
borrowing by PERTAMINA and other Government enterprises and gave Bank
Indonesia the sole authority to contract foreign obligations,instructed Bank
Indonesia to provide the funds needed to meet PERTAMINA's external obligations,
undertook a comprehensive review of the oil company's investment projects
and began the process of reducing and re-planning the companys investment
program and of cancelling and renegotiating many of the related procurement
contracts.
11.       The combination, in the last half of 1974/75, of slackening
receipts from exports of oil and other products, and of the need to meet
PERTAMINA's short term obligations resulted in a loss of the foreign
exchange reserves gained in the first half of the fiscal year. By March 31,
1975, these reserves were at the same level as at the beginning of April
1974.
12.       The balance of payments situation did not improve in the first
half of 1975/76. With continuing recessionary conditions in Indonesia's
principal markets exports failed to increase while imports rose again
(about 30 percent on an annual basis). Debt service payments on behalf
of PERTAMINA were very large (about $1.0 billion). As a result, Indonesia's
foreign exchange reserves declined by another $480 million, despite substan-
tial capital inflows, including two syndicated public cash borrowings
totalling $575 million raised in the international capital market.
1/   The premium on Indonesian oil has recently been reduced by the Govern-
ment's decision to raise the price of its main crude by 1.5 percent
(to $12.80) as compared with the 10 percent increase in the price
of Saudi Arabian light crude agreed at the meeting of OPEC in September
1975.



- 4 -
13.       For the remainder of the 1975/76 fiscal year balance of payments
prospects appear distinctly more favorable. Signs of modest recovery from
the recession have appeared in some industrialized countries, commodity
prices seem to have bottomed out and oil exports from Indonesia have
increased in recent months. Rice and fertilizer import needs are smaller
given the sizable stocks now on hand. Prices of some other imported
commodities have also fallen . Service on PERTAMINA's debt should be much
smaller and the Government has recently raised another cash loan amounting
to $425 million. A modest build-up of foreign exchange reserves is now
projected in the second half of the fiscal year.
14.       Budgetary revenues in 1974/75 were much lower than had been
anticipated at the middle of the year due partly to the withholding of
oil tax by PERTAMINA and partly to the shortfall in oil exports in the
second half of the year. The budget was, however, still in balance by
year's end as the Government reduced budgetary expenditure and certain
authorized expenditures were carried over into the 1975/76 fiscal year.
The budget for 1975/76 is balanced. Revenues as well as current and
domestically financed development expenditures are now expected to be
about 10 per cent lower than originally budgeted but still about 30 per-
cent higher than in the previous year.
15.       In spite of the shortfall in budgetary revenues, and the adminis--
trative difficulties involved in implementation of some projects, total
development expenditures doubled in 1974/75 compared to the previous year.
In 1975/76 they are expected to reach Rp 1.4 trillion or $3.3 billion,
including foreign project finance totalling about $1.0 billion and fertilizer
subsidies amounting to $350 million. This is about three times the actual
expenditures in 1973/74; even when adjusted for price changes this repre-
sents a near doubling.
16.       Preliminary figures indicate that the high growth rate achieved
during 1969-1973 was maintained in 1974. At constant 1973 prices, gross
domestic product rose by 7.5 percent in 1974. Partial indicators seem to
point to slower growth of output in 1975. The inflation rate was very high
in the first part of 1974 as, among other factors, world inflation, was
transmitted through both export and import channels, but abated somewhat
later in the year, partly as a result of the Government's stabilization
measures in April 1974. Nevertheless, for the year as a whole it reached 40
percent. While still considerable, the average inflation rate for 1975 is
expected to be only half of 1974's or about 20 percent.
17.       In the aftermath of the PERTAMINA crisis the Government is
faced with problems which, although seriouts, are surmountable. The review
of PERTAMINA's projects has resulted in cancellation or renegotiation of



many contracts and reductions in project scope and size. 1/. The Govern-
ment has more recently undertaken a broader review of projects initiated by
various Government departments and other State entitiess in an effort to
bring future expenditures in line with available resources and the priorities
set out in the Second Plan. It is considering very carefully any major new
programs or projects, since considerable resources will be needed in the
next year or two for the completion of projects already initiated.
18.       A longer-term effect of the recent financiaL difficulties will be
on the country's external public debt service obligations during the rest
of the decade. Debt service payments over the next several years will be
much larger than previously envisaged as a result of the large borrowings
by the Government in the current fiscal year. Debt service in 1975/76 is
now estimated at $500 million, which would be more than 10 percent of
officially projected net oil and other exports. Debt service payments on
all loans contracted to December 31,1975, may reach aoout one billion
by 1978 before declining as shorter-term maturities are paid off. This is
about $500 million more per year than the payments prDjected on the basis
of debt outstanding at the end of 1974. With debt service obligations from
these borrowings substantially higher than expected earlier (about 12 per-
cent of exports in 1978), the margin for further borrDwing on other than
semi-concessional terms has now become much more limited. The amounts,
terms and purposes of future borrowing therefore need to be kept under
continuous careful review.
19.       While the recent balance of payments and buigetary difficulties
have upset some of the Government's plans, the long-tarm prospects for
Indonesia's development remain good. The country has a substantial potential
for further productive investment, employment and income growth. In agricul-
ture, a vigorous pursuit of on-going programs in irrigation, development of
new plant varieties and technical services, provision of credit and current
inputs, etc., promises to yield high returns. In addition, there are large
opportunities for the development of new areas, of food and tree crops -
partly in conjunction with a rapidly growing transmigration program. The
industrial potential is good, both for modern capital-intensive natural
resource-based activities and for more labor-intensive, partly export-oriented
industries.
20.       The Government is clearly set on a course of accelerated growth
in investment, employment and income to realize Indonesia's potentials
and improve the welfare of the broad mass of the people. With a determined
effort to mobilize additional resources, a judicious use of them and assuming
1/   The planned capacity of the Krakatau Steel plant for example was reduced
from 2,000,000 to 500,000 tons per year and the existing supply contracts
were reduced by $750 million.

an international economy which is reasonably favorable to Indonesia, very
significant progress can be made in this direction.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA
21.       Part I of this Report emphasized Indonesia's plans for and need
to undertake a large investment and development program designed to provide
productive work opportunities (with resultant increased incomes) for its
presently underemployed and growing labor force. Substantial external
financing, the larger part on concessional and semiconcessional terms, as
well as a considerable volume of technical assistance is also required.
The Bank is planning to increase its lending to Indonesia and in particular
to support projects designed to:   improve agricultural credit, research and
extension; rehabilitate and expand irrigation systems; increase the produc-
tion and distribution of fertilizer; assist transmigration and nucleus
estates; increase non-agricultural employment in small towns, and rural and
small-scale industries; and rehabilitate and expand urgently needed trans-
portation and other infrastructure.
22.       As of November 30, 1975, Indonesia had received 37 IDA credits
totalling $561.8 million and eight Bank loans amounting to $426.5 million. 1/
At that date, IFC investments totalled $58.4 miLlion.     At the end of 1974
the Bank Group accounted for about 4 percent of Indonesia's total outstand-
ing public debt; by 1978 it is expected to account for 12 percent of total
outstanding debt and 5 percent of public debt service obligations. A
summary statement of IDA Credits, Bank Loans and IFC Investments as of
November 30, 1975, as well as notes on the execution of ongoing projects
are contained in Annex It.
23.       To date, agriculture accounts for just over one-third of all
Bank Group lending to Indonesia, including four IDA credits for estate
rehabilitation, six for the rehabilitation and expansion of the irrigation
systems, two for fisheries, and one each for seeds, beef cattle, sugar and
smallholder tea and rubber. In the industrial sector, the Bank Group has
assisted in three projects to expand PUSRI's fertilizer production capacity,
three for development finance companies (Government-owned and private)
which play a major role in fostering the growth of industrial enterprises,
and one for the Pulo Gadung industrial estate. Loans and credits have also
been extended to the transportation, education, telecommunications, tourism,
power, population, urbanization and water supply sectors, and four credits
have been made for technical assistance to aid the Government in preparing
and formulating its development programs and projects.
1/   In addition, Loan 1179-IND for US$21.5 million for an agricultural
research and extension project was signed December 19, 1975.



24.       Bank Group lending to Indonesia started with an IDA Credit in
1968 for irrigation rehabilitation; almost half of all loans and credits
have been made since mid-1972, with lending on Bank terms commencing in
June 1974. The rate of disbursements on loans and credits up to the end of
1974 was slow, due in part to the rapid increase of tae program during the
first four years of lending and in part to the fact thxat a number of credits
have financed projects whose execution is planned to take place over extended
periods. Furthermore, in a considerable number of prijects there were
associated institutional reforms requiring the enactment of new laws and
charters which have resulted in delays in the initial implementation
stages. However, over the last twelve months disbursements have accelerated
and are now at an acceptable level. The Indonesian authorities have become
increasingly aware of the delays in project execution caused by cumbersome
procedures and the need to establish an effective control system in BAPPENAS
(the National Development Planning Agency). At the Government's request,
the Bank has arranged for assistance under the Fourth Technical Assistance
Credit (Cr. 451-IND) to help set up a monitoring and control system which
it is hoped will lead to better project administration.
25.       Future Bank lending   gives high priority to the agricultural
sector through support of projects to increase rice and other crop produc-
tion in the Inner and Outer Islands, and the expansion of resettlement
efforts on the latter. In addition, the program provides for further
socially-oriented projects in the fields of urban development and population.
Projects for agricultural extension, power, education, shipping, highways,
sugar production, fertilizer production and distribution, irrigation,
nutrition, as well as a loan to a private development finance company are
expected to be ready for presentation in the coming several months.
PART III - CURRENT STATUS OF MAPPING AND RESOURCE SURVEY
26.       Resource-based industries, particularly agriculture, forestry,
petroleum, gas and hard minerals extraction, are of central importance
to the Indonesian economy. They account for more than two-thirds of
total employment and over 60 percent of GDP and Government revenues.
27.       Most of the resource development efforts of both Government
agencies and foreign firms have been directed to the (levelopment of land
and forest resources and mineral deposits which were well-known and often
in production before World War II. Much of this investment has had to be
directed to the rehabilitation and modernization of large elements of
public infrastructure, such as ports, irrigation systems, and highways
and of mining and commercial agriculture establishmenl:s which had fallen
into disrepair over the previous decades. As the baclklog of such invest-
ments in the traditional sectors and the more developed areas has been



- 8 -
reduced, and the attention of Government planners has shifted to less-
developed regions, serious deficiencies in the availability of information
of Indonesia's natural resources and physical environment have become
apparent.
28.       The lack of adequate resource data has thus become an increasingly
important constraint on effective national and regional planning and on
the rate of preparation and implementation of individual projects. Efforts
to evaluate and map the topography, soils, hydrology, forests, and other
resources have been seriously hindered by the absence of up-to-date maps,
aerial photography, and geodetic control. At present, geodetically control-
led base-maps at the 1:50,000 scale required for thematic mapping and
evaluation of most national resources are available for only 13 percent of
the total land area of Indonesia. This inadequate coverage, which is
proportionally among the lowest in the world, raises the cost of survey
work and biases survey activity, systematic resource evaluation, and
subsequent development investment towards regionis which were previously
mapped.
29.       The existing situation in the mapping and resource survey fields
is due in part to inadequate funding of geodetic and base-mapping work
and specialized resource survey and mapping activities, but it is also due
to excessive fragmenitation of effort in these fields and a resultant incon-
sistency of work. As the specialized agencies use widely varying map
projections, base-map scales, and categories and modes of presentation
to represent their research findings, much of their output can neither
be evaluated comparatively nor integrated to serve as a firm basis for
planning and design of agriculture, transmigration, transportation, and
other projects with strong regional impact.
30.       The lack of base-map coverage and the slow pace of recent base-map
production is also partly due to the total reliance on topographic maps
as the nation's base-map source. Most of these topographic maps are
produced by the Survey and Mapping Division of the Department of Defence
(JANTOP). While detailed planning and thematic maps often require the
addition of topographic contour lines, requirements for a national base-map
series could be met more efficiently by uncontoured planimetric maps which
can be produced rapidly and at a high order of accuracy by the automatic
orthophoto process. Such maps would satisfactorily fulfill the fundamental
base-map function of presenting the geodetic data required for all sub-
sequent specialized mapping.
31.       The National Coordinating Agency for Surveys and Mapping
(BAKOSURTANAL) is reponsible for coordinating mapping, survey and aerial
photogaphy operations within the Government. However, BAKOSURTANAL will
need a substantial increase in its staff, budget and facilities to be
able to carry out these responsibilities effectively.    Also, the lack of
an accurate and consistent series of base-maps covering the national



- 9 -
territory has made it difficult for BAKOSURTANAL to standardize sectoral
thematic mapping and to coordinate field investigations of resources and
environmental conditions.
32.       BAKOSURTANAL has recently also been given the major responsibility
for resource inventory and evaluation within the Government. This task,
which involves the compilation, preliminary economic evaluation, and
presentation of resource data in a form that will assist economic planning
and policy making, has been performed haphazardly in the past, never having
been clearly assigned to any specific agency. The assignment of this
function to BAKOSURTANAL will allow it to coordinate the full range of
resource field work and analysis as a basis for more effective national
planning by BAPPENAS, the National Development Planning Agency.
33.       The Government has decided that a substantial investment in
aerial photography, geodetic control, equipment and i:he facilities for the
production of base-maps and other mapping materials Is necessary to improve
Indonesia's resource data base for national and regional planning, in
order to make more effective use of Indonesia's resources, and to carry out
the increasing number of projects required for Indonesia's expanding devel-
opment programs. As noted above, it is also the policy of the Government to
strengthen BAKOSURTANAL to allow it to take effective responsibility for
base-mapping, resource survey and resource inventory and evaluation. This
in turn will help ensure continuous updating of data on a permanent and
reliable basis and effective coordination and standardization of the tasks
performed by specialized resource survey and mapping agencies.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
34.       The proposed project consists of several iroterrelated components
which may be grouped into two broad parts. Part I provides for the estab-
lishment of a national resource survey and mapping capability, and includes
the construction of facilities and the acquisition of equipment required for
map production and resource evaluation; procurement t,f remote sensor imagery
and large-scale aerial photography to support detailed resource mapping and
evaluation, and navigational charting; and technical assistance and training
in project-related fields. In additon, Part I would include a program of
mapping and resource survey operations to be implemented by the National
Coordinating Agency for Surveys and Mapping (BAKOSURTANAL) utilizing these
facilities and services, and a complementary program of technical services
to be executed by qualified survey firms. The foreign exchange costs of
Part I would be financed by the Bank. Part II of the project provides for the
1:100,000 scale aerial photography, geodetic control, and aerial triangula-
tion required to complete the national base-mapping program. This part of
the project would be financed by the Government, possibly with bilateral
assistance.



- 10 -
35.       Initiation of Part I now is required in order to avoid further
serious delay in the overall Indonesian resource survey and mapping effort,
particularly because the construction, equipment procurement, and institution-
building components included in Part I require a longer lead time than do
the survey operations included in Part II. Another reason for proceeding
with Part I at this time arises from the availability of a substantial
volume of base-mapping materials already being produced through joint
Australian/Indonesian operations in Sumatera and Irian Jaya. Between 1976
and 1978 the ongoing Australian bilateral assistance program is expected to
produce aerial photography and geodetic data covering about 20 percent of
the land area of the country, much of which would remain unprocessed in the
absence of the proposed project. Proceeding with Part I at this time will
enable that backlog to be substantially reduced through contract map produc-
tion by qualified survey firms, while still ensuring an initial workload for
BAKOSURTANAL in 1978, when its own facilities would be completed, also under
Part I of the project. The implementation of Plart II would commence in 1978
at the latest, thereby ensuring a continuing flow of small-scale photography
and geodetic data throughout the project life, and the completion of base-
mapping for most of Indonesia by the end of 1980. The Government has assumed
full responsibility for the financing of Part II, with bilateral assistance,
or with its own funds. At present, the Government is discussing with
the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) assistance for Part II,
in addition to assistance for a proposed natioTnal forest resource evaluation
project.
36.       The proposed project would provide the implementing agency,
BAKOSURTANAL, with the physical capability and technical assistance required
to complete an accurate series of geodetically-controlled base-maps for
the entire country and to coordinate natural resource inventory and evalua-
tion for Indonesia. Bank Group missions in July 1973 and March 1974 and a
CIDA mission in June 1974, assisted the Government in preparing the pro-
posed project. A Bank mission assisted by consultants and a CIDA represent-
ative, appraised the project in October/November 1974. Negotiations were
held in Washington, D.C. from October 20-28, 1975. The Government delega-
tion was led by Mr. Pranoto Asmoro. The appraisal report (No. 689a-IND dated
January 15, 1976)is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors
and a project and loan surnmary is contained in Annex III of this report.
Project Description
37.       The main components of the project are:
Part I
(a)  Construction of headquarters for BAKOSURTANAL
at Cibinong, including suitable facilities for
printing and cartographic shops and photographic
laboratories;



- 11 -
(b)  Procurement of cartographic, printing, imagery
interpretation, and other equipment requir.ed for
both map production and reconnaissance resource
evaluation;
(c) Procurement of remote sensor imagery, incliding
earth satellite output;
(d) Aerial photography at scales of 1:50,000 and above,
of approximately 300,000 km2 to support detailed
mapping of specific areas for project planaing and
charting purposes;
(e)  Technical services to be executed by qualilied survey
firms, including geodetic control, photo proces-
sing and reproduction, and contract map production
for delimited areas;
(f)  Engagement of individual experts to providE technical
assistance to BAKOSURTANAL in geodesy, aerial photo-
graphy, cartography, printing processes and resource
evaluation;
(g)  Training in the country and overseas of BACOSURTANAL's
senior technical and professional staff, a-id training
in the country of staff technicians;
Part II
(h) Aerial photography at a scale of 1:100,000 of approxi-
mately 950,000 km2;
(i) Extension throughout Indonesia of the prim3ry, secondary,
and tertiary geodetic control network to density required
for 1:50,000 scale mapping; and
(j) Aerial triangulation of all areas flown.
Base-Map Production
38.       Planimetric base-maps at 1:50,000 scale of Java, Bali, the
Lesser Sunda Islands, the Moluccas, Sulawesi, and ths unmapped portions of
Kalimantan, would be produced by BAKOSURTANAL utilizing equipment and
technical services provided under Part I of the project and 1:100,000 scale
aerial photography and additional geodetic control data to be provided
under Part II. Maps covering Irian Jaya and the unmapped portions of
Sumatera at the same scale would be produced for BAKOSURTANAL by



- 12 -
survey firms under Part I of the project, utilizing aerial photography and
geodetic control provided with Australian assistance. The two sets of maps
would be fully compatible, and together would constitute a consistent
series which would serve as the basis for resource surveys, thematic
mapping, and navigational charting throughout Indonesia. In addition, the
equipment to be provided would enable BAKOSURTANAL to add topographic
contours to the base-maps of specific areas to be studied intensively.
Charting Operations
39.       BAKOSURTANAL would produce urgently required aeronautical and
maritime navigational charts, utilizing equipment and large scale aerial
photography provided under the project. The charts would be keyed to
the new base-maps and to the geodetic data to be produced under the project
and through JANTOP's operations. Charting work programs would follow the
priorities established by the Department of Communications. In addition,
BAKOSURTANAL would provide satellite imagery materials and analysis to
the Department of Communications to assist in the preparation of naviga-
tional guides and bulletins and to update existing charts.
Regional Resource Surveys
40.       Although small-scale photography and satellite imagery will
facilitate resource and environmental analysis at the reconnaissance
level and help identify broad patterns of potential development, field
surveys would be required to generate the more detailed data needed to
identify project possibilities and to delineate favorable project areas.
Survey operations would be planned and directed by BAKOSURTANAL, although
the field teams would be composed of staff drawn from the line departments
and universities as well as from BAKOSURTANAL.
Organization and Management
41.       BAKOSURTANAL would be responsible for the implementation of
the project. It is one of five non-departmental agencies engaged in
the collection, processing and analysis of basic data and statistics. 1/
These five agencies are under the statutory control of the Minister
of State for Research, who has broad authority in the area of natural
resource evaluation.
42.        BAKOSURTANAL was established in 1969 to advise the President
of the Republic of Indonesia on all matters related to mapping, surveys
and natural resource evaluation. As noted in paragraph 32, it has recently
been given responsibility for resource evaluation activities carried out
by the Government and the use of ERTS imagery for resource evaluation
1/   The other four are the Central Bureau of Statistics, the Indonesian
Institute for Sciences, the National Institute for Aeronautics and
Space and the National Agency for Atomic Energy.



- 13 -
purposes. The site selected for the new headquarters of BAKOSURTANAL is
part of a 208 ha extent of Government-owned land at Cibinong, West Java,
which is under the jurisdiction of the Minister of State for Research.
43.       BAKOSURTANAL is administered by a chairman assisted by four
deputies, responsible respectively for base-mapping, special maps and
charts, resource evaluation, and systems management. The chairman would
be the project manager. In addition, a computer programming section
would be added to handle the anticipated increase in analytical cartogra-
phic and resource inventory work. Due to the importance of the roles
they would play in the execution of the project, the future appointments of
the Chairman and the Deputies for base-mapping and resource evaluation
would be made after consultation with the Bank (Section 4.04(b) of the Loan
Agreement).
44.       BAKOSURTANAL employs at present about 45 pErsonnel and this
number will have to increase to about 220 by the time the project is
completed. Some of the additional staff will be recruited from the ranks
of university graduates and military officers retirirg from the technical
mapping services, but a substantial training effort will have to be under-
taken in order to allow BAKOSURTANAL to expand its capacity. About half
of the required training will be provided under the project and the other
half is expected to be provided by foreign and local training programs
financed under bilateral aid. In addition, BAKOSURTANAL would
organize its own courses to train personnel to meet specific requirements.
All of these activities, and the execution of the fellowship program
to be financed by the project, would require effective coordination and,
to this end, BAKOSURTANAL would appoint a qualified training officer
within nine months of the date of the Loan Agreement (Section 3.08 of
the Loan Agreeent).
45.       Although BAKOSURTANAL would increase its staff under its training
and recruitment plans, the magnitude and complexity cf the tasks to be
performed under the project would require additional expertise in several
highly specialized fields. The Dutch and Australian Governments are
committed under their bilateral aid programs to provide experts in photogram-
metry and cartography, geodesy and aerial photography. Provision for
additional technical assistance for geodesy and aerial photography would be
made under Part II of the proposed project to assist BAKOSURTANAL in
the planning and coordination of the extensive survey components included
in that portion of the project. The proposed Bank loan would finance
a total of about 12 man-years of services of internationally recruited
experts in the fields of resource survey, imagery analysis, orthophoto
production, aeronautical charting, cartographic reproduction and data
analysis. The resource survey expert would be responsible for advising
the management of BAKOSURTANAL on the selection of other experts and would
be appointed within six months of the date of the Loan Agreement (Section
3.02(b) of the Loan Agreement).   BAKOSURTANAL would also engage a suitable
firm to assist in carrying out the geodetic control and map production
included in the project (Section 3.02(c) of the Loan Agreement).



- 14 -
46.       The coordination between BAKOSuRTANAL and other Government
agencies would be ensured through a steering committee which has been
established and is chaired by the Minister of State for Research. There
would also be a technical committee, on which the departments concerned
would be represented.   The Chairman of BAKOSURTANAL would chair this
technical committee. The capacity of the specialized agencies which
will make use of the base maps produced under the project has been rapidly
expanding in recent years, in some cases with substantial technical as-
sistance provided by international and bilateraL donors.
47.       In the past, available mapping, imagery and survey materials
were not distributed as widely as desirable. In order to ensure unrestricted
access for all interested Government agencies and private organizations,
firms and individuals performing work for the Government, the Government
has agreed that all data, imagery, photography, and charts produced under
the project would be made available to such agencies, firms and individuals
(Section 4.03 of the L]oan Agreement). A library to house all materials
produced under the project would also be established.
48.       The successful implementation of the major mapping and resource
survey operations to be execuLted under the proposed project depends on
the timely provision of aerial photography. As substantial delays in
obtaining flight clearances have occasionally been encountered by foreign
contractors performing aerial photography work on Government-supported
projects, the Government has agreed that: (a) BAKOSURTANAL would be
responsible for obtaining all clearances required to implement the project;
and (b) the Government would ensure that such clearances are issued prior
to the signing of aerial photography contracts financed by the proposed
loan (Section 3.07 of and Schedule 4 to the Loan Agreement).
Project Cost and Financing
49.       The total project costs are estimated at US$46 million equiva-
lent of which US$32.2 million, or 70 percent, would be in foreign exchange.
Physical contingencies of 15 percent have been allowed on all items,
except technical assistance. For equipment, price contingencies are based
on projected price increases of 10 percent in 1976, 8 percent in 1977-79
and 7 percent in 1980. For all other items and physical contingencies,
prices are based on projected increases of 14 percent in 1976, 12 percent
in 1977-79 and 10 perc:ent in 1980. Price contingencies amount to 27
percent of total project costs.
50.       The proposed Bank loan of US$13 million would finance the full
foreign exchange cost, or 50 percent of the total cost of Part I of the
Project. The local costs of Part I, US$13 mfllion equivalent, would be
covered by annual budget appropriations of the Government. To assure
adequate funding during the start-up period, the Government has already
formally allocated sufficient funds to BAKOSURTANAL to finance Part I
through March 1977.   Assurances were obtained at negotiations that, within
two years of Loan signing, the Government would make definitive arrangements



- 15 -
satisfactory to the Bank for financing Part II of the Project (Section 3.09
of the Loan Agreement). The proposed loan would have a repayment term of
twenty years, including six years of grace.
Procurement and Disbursement
51.       Except as noted below, all components of the project to be
financed by the Bank loan, including large-scale aerial photography (US$3.1
million) and materials and equipment (US$4.0 million) would be procured
after international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group
Guidelines. For equipment and materials, a preference of 15 percent or the
level of customs duties, whichever is less, would be provided to qualified
local manufacturers. Small off-the-shelf items, costing less than $10,000
each, and limited to a total of $200,000 would be purchased through normal
Government procedures, which are satisfactory. In addition, some of the
required equipment and materials ($400,000) are highly specialized,
patented or compatible with larger equipment systems, and are thus unsuit-
able for international competitive bidding. Such equipment, after the
prior approval of the Bank, would be procured on the basis of prudent
shopping procedures. The civil works contracts for headquarters building
and facilities (US$1.4 million) of BAKOSURTANAL would be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Guide-
lines. Qualified domestic contracting firms would be given a 7-1/2 percent
preference in bid comparison. There are a number of local firms who could
compete successfully for this contract.
52.       For the provision of technical services, valued at US$2.2
million, including the extension of geodetic control in Kalimantan, photo-
graphic processing and base-map production for Sumatera and Irian Jaya,
qualified individual firms or consortia of firms would be selected, following
procedures acceptable to the Bank.
53.       The proposed loan would be disbursed for 100 percent of the
foreign exchange cost of directly imported equipment and materials,
95 percent of the ex-factory cost of such items manufactured locally
and 65 percent of the'actual cost of imported but locally procured items.
It would also be disbursed to cover foreign exchange costs of consultant
services and overseas training. The loan would also be disbursed for
65 percent of the cost of civil works, 55 percent of the cost of large-
scale photography and for 50 percent of the cost of technical services.
Benefits and Justification
54.       The proposed project would make a substantial contribution
to the economy of Indonesia by: (a) reducing the costs and delays incurred
in the mapping and survey activities required for prcject preparation
and specialized survey purposes; (b) improving the effectiveness of sectoral,
regional, and environmental planning and policy-making; and (c) increasing
the safety and efficiency of aviation and navigation. Since the mapping
undertaken under the project would provide the basis for most other mapping



- 16 -
required for purposes of planning and project implementation and would
establish geodetic control for the whole country, the benefits accruing to
Indonesia through cost reductions in specialized mapping programs would be
considerable. The regional resource surveys would improve the productivity
of investment in agriculture, transmigration and land settlement, timber
and mineral extraction and related transportation infrastructure, since
investment efficiency in those sectors is particularly dependent on the
accuracy and coverage of natural resource information. The costs of the
proposed project on an annual basis represent less than 2 percent of
current public investment in the benefitting sectors, and relatively small
improvements in the productivity of these investments due to improved
planning and information would alone be sufficient to justify the proposed
project. The project can thus be regarded as a central element in the
Government's efforts to expand the scope and productivity of its future
investment programs.
55.       The proposed project would improve the effectiveness of economic
planning at all levels of Government. Sectoral planning in the resource-
based fields would benefit from an expanded body of resource data derived
from aerial photography, satellite imagery, and field surveys, as well as
from an institutionalized capacity in BAKOSURTANAL to continuously update
and refine the data base and to evaluate resource availabilities in economic
terms. This data base and institutional capacity would also enable BAPPENAS,
the National Development Planning Agency,to determine where conflicts
between various sectoral programs exist, and to select alternatives which
make the most effective use of available resources. The regional resource
analyses and estimates of regional comparative advantage to be produced by
BAKOSURTANAL would provide both BAPPENAS and local administrations with a
firm technical basis for regional planning. Finally, the project would
provide the information system necessary to monitor ecological developments
and to devise policies to prevent environmental deterioration and resource
waste.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
56.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Indonesia and
the Bank, the recommendations of the Committe provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and the text of a
draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
57.       Features of the Loan Agreement of special interest are referred
to in paragraphs 43, 44, 45, 47, 48 and 50 of this report.
58.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1!
Cr. No. 127:      Irrigation Rehabilitation:   US$5 Million Credit of
September 6, 1968: Effective Date: March 25, 1969:
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
It is expected that all civil work; will be completed
by March 1976. Additional drainage work will be caried out under Loan
1100-IND and tertiary development under the proposed Irrigation VII Project.
The closing date has been postponed by one year to allow for payment of
late accounts. The adequacy and timeliness of operation and maintenance
of completed irrigation rehabilitation projects is presently under discus-
sion with the Government.
Cr. No. 154:      Highways: US$28 Million Credit of June 20, 1969;
Effective Date: October 2, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1975.
Rehabilitation work, of acceptable quality, has been
completed. The work accomplished exceeded the project's original target.
The program for improved highway maintenance included in the project has
been largely completed.   Orders have been placed for remaining equipment
purchases.
Cr. No. 155:      Agricultural Estates:   US$16 Millicn Credit of June 20,
1969; Effective Date: December 10, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
With improvements in management and much higher inter-
national prices, particularly for palm oil, prevailing in 1974, the
financial position of the estate groups has improved. The field and
factory standards have now been raised to a good technical level and
the managements have been advised to concentrate on cost control in order
to prepare for the time when produce prices may become less attractive.
The combined efforts of the management, consultants and IDA missions
to review project implementation are yielding good results. The closing
date has been postponed to December 31, 1976 to enable payment to con-
sultants for services for other rubber estates.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in pa:-ticular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sengse, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present: a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 165:       Electricity Distribution:   US$15 Million Credit of
October 29, 1969; Effective Date: June 1, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
See comment on Credit No. 334. The closing date, which
had already been postponed by 18 months, has been postponed by another
six months to December 31, 1975, to allow for payment of small amounts
outstanding.
Cr. No. 193:       PUSRI Fertilizer:  US$35 Million Credit of June 15,
1970 (as amended May 21, 1973); Effective Date:
January 15, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The urea plant has successfully passed its performance
test and is operating at close to rated capacity. The gas gathering
and transmission system is also completed and sufficient gas is being
delivered to the plant. The closing date has been postponed to December
31, 1976 to allow for delivery and installation of remaining equipment.
Cr. No. 194:       Second Agricultural Estates:   US$17 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970; Effective Date: February 9, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
After initial delays, there have been considerable
improvements in management and these, combined with high prices, particular-
ly for palm oil, have resulted in the two estate groups being put in a
much stronger financial position. On the rubber group (PNP IV) more effort
is necessary to improve agricultural standards and tapping methods. With
the rapid expansion of investment of the palm oil group (PNP VI), there is
a need to employ expertise in financial planning, control and management,
which are now the main constraints to efficient development. This estate
group is undertaking action in this respect. The closing date has been
postponed by one year to allow payment for remaining equipment, civil
works and consultants' contracts.
Cr. No. 195:       Second Irrigation Rehabilitation:   US$18.5 Million Credit
of June 15, 1970; Effective Date: December 31, 1970;
Closing Date: November 30, 1976.
Problems of quality and progress of construction still
exist, but the project entity assisted by the consultants are tackling
these vigorously, and the situation is improving, although not sufficiently
to make up for earlier delays. Costs are likely to be double the overall
appraisal estimate, due to inflation, but the Government will provide any
additional funds required. Completion of disbursements will be about two
years behind the original schedule.

Cr. No. 210:      Telecommunications Expansion:   US$12.8 Million Credit
of July 13, 1970; Effective Date: February 18 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Contracts for all equipment have been awarded. The
physical work has been substantially completed. The 1roposcatter system
and the telex installation, which had been delayed, w:}ll be completed
by December 1975. Although Government has increased tariffs, PERUMTEL's
financial results are not satisfactory and a review oi' its financial
position is required. The closing date, which had been postponed by
18 months due to delays in the delivery of goods, has been postponed
by another six months to allow for payments of outstanding contracts.
Cr. No. 211:      Fisheries:  US$3.5 Million Credit oi- July 13, 1970;
Effective Date: January 15, 1971: Closing Date:
June 30, 1976.
The credit helps finance the construction of 30 fully
equipped skipjack boats, auxiliary facilities and techinical assistance.
The project is about 18 months behind the original schedule due to delays
in making satisfactory arrangements for the consultant:s and in executing
the contracts for the shore facilities. No further delay is anticipated.
There has been very substantial project cost increases. Because of
the greatly increased skipjack prices, however, the project is still
expected to be financially viable. Strengthening of project management
and additional local fund allocations are presently under discussion with
Government.
Cr. No. 219:      Education:  US$4.6 Million Credit oi- November 6, 1970;
Effective Date: January 29, 1971; Closing Date;
December 31, 1976.
Project implementation in the Depart:ment of Education
is satisfactory.  Civil works for the five Technical 'raining Centers
(TTCs) have been completed. About 90 percent of the equipment has been
purchased and about 60 percent delivered and installecl. All TTCs will
operate at full capacity by January 1976 when the new academic year begins.
Over 500 technical techers have completed or are aboul: to complete their
training. Technical assistance financed by the U.K. for the project is
also satisfactory. Disbursement has improved considerably. Revised
total project cost is now about 40 percent above appraisal estimate. The
Government will finance the cost overrun. The projet is expected to be
completed about three months ahead of schedule.
Cr. No. 220:      Third Irrigation Rehabilitation:   US$14.5 Million Credit
of November , 1970; Effective Date: May 28, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
Construction remains about two to three years behind
schedule partly because of problems with preparation of contract documents
and subsequently due to inflation. These problems have now been mostly
overcome and no further delays are expected. It is unlikely, however,



ANNEX II
Page 7 of 13
that the time lost could be regained. The closing date has been post-
poned by 18 months as a result of the project delay. There has been
a considerable increase in overall project costs, which is being met
by the Government.
Cr. No. 246:       Seeds:  US$7.5 Million Credit of May 19, 1971:
Effective Date: December 7, 1971; Closing Date:
September 30, 1977.
The project is very much behind schedule as a result
of delays in completing irrigation infrastructure and land development
needed for mechanized rice cultivation. Construction of the seed processing
plant is also behind schedule and serious cost overruns have occurred.
Closely associated with the delays are technical and mnanagerial problems.
The last supervision mission undertook in December 1975, a project review
and will shortly make recommmendations to improve project performance.
Cr. No. 259:       Tea:  US$15 Million Credit of June 24, 1971; Effective
Date: September 17, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
Agricultural achievements to date have far exceeded
appraisal expectations necessitating construction and rehabilitation
of three additional factories. Project completion, estimated for December
1977, can probably be advanced by up to one year. Rising costs are creating
pressure on available funds and the main challenge for the two PTP's will
be to reduce working capital requirements, as well as overhead and indirect
costs, and improve labor productivity.
Cr. No. 260:       Second Highway:  US$34 Million Credit of June 24, 1971;
Effective Date: August 10, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976.
All construction work is now satisfactorily under way.
However, the delay caused initially by slow progress in mobilizing con-
tractors, difficulties in equipment delivery, heavy rains and landslides
will result in the project being completed about one year behind schedule.
The closing date has therefore been postponed to December 31, 1976.
Design standards for the road sections have been slightly lowered and
some savings will be achieved, which, together with other savings are
expected to partly offset construction cost increases.
Cr. No. 275:       Third Technical Assistance: US$4.0 Million Credit of
December 29, 1971; Effective Date: February 25,
1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Progress on this project is satisfactory. The closing
date has been postponed by another year to complete disbursements for
ongoing studies.

Cr. No. 288:       Second Education:  US$6.3 Million Credit of March 9,
1972; Effective Date: June 7, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
This agricultural training project, being implemented
by the Department of Agriculture, is about 16 month3 delayed because of
late appointment of consultant architects, lack of counterpart funds, delays
in bid analysis and in awarding contracts. As a re3ult, civil works,
which were to be completed already, have not commenced. Furniture and
equipment procurement have therefore been deferred. Unlike the physical
aspects of the project, the educational aspects are generally on schedule.
Total project costs are now estimated to be 90 percant higher than the
original estimate. Government has budgeted for the cost overrun. Disburse-
ment, which has been slow, should improve since civil works contracts have
now been awarded.
Cr. No. 289:       Fourth Irrigation Rehabilitation:  US$12.5 Million Credit
of March 9, 1972; Effective Date: May 5, 1972; Closing
Date: June 30, 1977.
Civil Works and equipment purchasas for the main project,
Pekalen-Sampean, are proceeding but completion of civil works will be
about two years behind schedule. Due to inflation, project costs are
likely to be substantially higher than appraisal esLimates. Consultants
for the various studies are at work with their counterparts. Groundwater
investigations have been delayed due to procurement difficulties. The
rehabilitation and storage feasibility studies are on schedule. Disburse-
ments are also on schedule.
Cr. No. 300:       Population:  US$13.2 Million Credit of April 20, 1972;
Effective Date: November 2, 1972; Closing Date: June 30,
1978.
Progress of this project is generally satisfactory.
Steps are being taken to improve preparation and implementation of project
components concerned with communications, research and evaluation. All
vehicles have been procured and good progress is being made with equipment
procurement. The civil works section of the Project Implementation Unit
functions well but is underutilized because of delays in making policy
decisions. Construction costs will exceed appraisal estimates by 135
percent. Population Education is now being introduced into school curricula
after a successful trial. Despite its limitations, the national family
planning program, of which the project is an integral part, is expanding
annually.
Cr. No. 310:      Development Finance Co. (BAPINDO I):    US$10 Million Credit
of June 7, 1972; Effective Date: August 10, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
This credit is fully committed.

Cr. No. 318:       Inter-Island Fleet Rehabilitation:  US$8.5 Million
Credit of June 28, 1972; Effective Date: October 19,
1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1976.
Progress on1 this project is generally satisfactory.
Cr. No. 319:      Fourth Agricultural Estates:   US$11 Million Credit of
June 28, 1972; Effective date: January 30, 1973:
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
The physical progress of the project is ahead of the
appraisal schedule. The financial position of the estate group is dif-
ficult due to unsatisfactory debt/equity ratios. Measures to improve the
situation are under review.
Cr. No. 334:      Second Electricity Distribution:   US$40 Million Credit
of September 29, 1972; Effective Date: March 12, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The Jakarta distribution program financed from Credits
165-IND and 334-IND (together $55 million) has encountered substantial foreign
cost increases ($7.0 million) and implementation delays due to procurement
problems and cumbersome management procedures. As a result the project is
two years behind the original schedule. Many of these difficulties have
been resolved and recent progress is encouraging. No further delays are
therefore expected.
Cr. No 355:       Beef Cattle Development:   US$3.6 Million Credit of
January 31, 1973; Effective Date: May 30, 1973;
Closing Date: March 31, 1980.
Several problems have seriously delayed project imple-
mentation. Land acquisition and procurement of cattle and goods have been
problematic, Government's budget allocation has been insufficient and fi-
nancial management and coordination have been weak. The last supervision
mission undertook a thorough project review and its recommendations, which
include major changes in project scope and objectives, are presently under
discussion with Government.
Cr. No. 358:       North Sumatera Smallholder Development:   US$5 Million
Credit of February 14, 1973; Effective Date: August 13,
1973; Closing Date, December 31, 1981.
Project performance, which had suffered from severe fin-
nancial and organizational difficulties, has improved greatly. Physical
progress is encouraging; rubber planting and rice intercropping are now
on schedule. There is some room for improvement in financial management,
in which consultants are assisting. Total project costs are now estimated
at about three times the original estimate of US$10 million. Disbursements
are expected to be completed ahead of schedule.

Cr. No. 387:       Third Education:  US$13.5 Million Credit of June 1,
1973; Effective Date: August 29, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The project is about 10 months behinc! schedule, mainly
due to insufficient top management staff and paper shortages last year.
The paper shortage has been overcome and about 32 million text books will
be printed by January 1976, about four months behind schedule.     Steps
are being taken to strengthen project management and tco improve arrangements
for expert services. Measures to improve project implementation have been
discussed and agreed with the Government. The book terting and teacher
training programs are on schedule, but their results hive not yet been
evaluated. Procurement of instructional equipment will be completed by
early 1976.
Cr. No. 388:       Third Highways:  US$14 Million Credit: of June 1, 1973;
Effective Date: June 25, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977.
Construction bidding and consultant selection have
been completed and construction is underway.    Some cost: increases, due to
inflation, are expected.
Cr. No. 399:       West Java Thermal Power:   US$46 Mill:on Credit of
June 22, 1973; Effective Date: August 28, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
Bids received for the first two 100 nw units at Muara
Karang were about 65 percent higher than estimated at the time of appraisal.
This, together with construction cost increases, has resulted in an increase
in the total project cost of more than 100 percent. Arrangements to fi-
nance these cost overruns are presently being worked out. PLN has satis-
factorily met the initial targets in its financial recovery plan pro-
vided for under the terms of the Credit Agreement.
Cr. No. 400:       Smallholder and Private Estate Tea:   US$7.8 Million
Credit of June 22, 1973; Effective Date: November 30,
1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1982.
Planting is presently slightly behind schedule but
it is expected that targets will be achieved or even e.cceeded by the end
of the 1975/76 planting season. Project nurseries are well organized
and field work is proceeding well. Also non-participai:ing farmers have
benefitted from the project. Total project costs are estimated to be
double the amount originally envisaged and project management is attempting
to achieve cost reductions. Due to the high prices fo:- tea (about twice
the level expected at the time of appraisal), the economic rate of return
is still satisfactory.
Cr. No. 405:       Sugar Industry Rehabilitation:   US$50) Million Credit of
June 26, 1973; Effective Date:   ApriL 22, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.



ANNEX TI
Page 11 of 13
Most equipment contracts for the major factory re-
habilitation have now been let. In light of the substantial cost over-
runs the Government has proposed that the scope of the project be reduced.
This proposal is presently being considered.
Cr. No. 428:       Pulo Gadung Industrial Estate:   US$16.5 Million Credit
of September 14, 1973; Effective Date: November 13,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Despite an increase in construction costs, the project
remains financially viable because revenues from the sale of plots has
risen proportionately. Construction has fallen behind schedule due to
land acquisition problems, but developed land is being occupied as fast
as it is made available. While there is still a backlog of applications
for industrial plots, the rate of new applications has fallen off during
recent months and the estate is intensifying its promotional efforts.
Cr. No. 436:       Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia
(PDFCI): US$10 Million Credit of November 2, 1973;
Effective Date: March 6, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
After a long start-up period and difficulties in finding
and recruiting qualified local staff, PDFCI has now reached the operating
stage.  Commitments have started and are expected to increase rapidly
as PDFCI's own operational capability improves.
Cr. No. 451:       Fourth Technical Assistance:   US$5 Million Credit of
January 2, 1974; Effective Date: February 15, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Progress under the project is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 479:       Bali Tourism:  US$16.0 Million Credit of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: December 4, 1974; Closing Date:
August 31, 1979.
Project implementation has improved after initial dif-
ficulties. Designs for various project components have been completed
and construction will start in April 1976. Negotiations with hotel investors
will be finalized soon. Project organization and management envisaged in
the Credit Agreement have been modified and design changes aimed at achieving
cost reductions have been made in the roads component.
Cr. No. 480:       Fisheries Credit:   US$6.5 Million Credit of June 14,
1974; Effective Date: January 8, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979.
After initial delays in project organization and prepara-
tion by Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), the project is progressing well.
Physical progress is encouraging and lending has started in October.
Disbursements are therefore expected to be on schedule soon.

Cr. No. 514:       Jatiluhur Irrigation Extension:   US$30 Million Credit
of October 3, 1974; Effective Date': January 10, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
The consultants are designing work; and preparing contract
documents. The first civil works contract is expected to be let in May
1976, about nine months behind the original schedule.
Loan No. 1005:     Railway:  US$48.0 Million Loan of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: August 16, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
Procurement of material and equipment, which had been
slow due to poor organization and inadequte budget aLlocation, has now
improved. Bids have been received for most items and the bulk of the
contracts should be signed soon. Passenger traffic ln 1975 is slightly
lower than in 1974, but still higher than forecast; Ereight traffic has
continued to decline due mainly to poor maintenance and inadequate motive
power, which should improve towards the end of 1976. Although tariffs were
raised in May 1975, increasing passenger revenues by about 25 percent and
freight revenues by about 10 percent, the operating ratio is likely to
deteriorate further, as operating costs have continued to rise at a faster
rate.
Loan No. 1040:     Jakarta Urban Development:   US$25 Million Loan of
September 27, 1974; Effective Date: January 15, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Progress on the Kampung Improvement Program has been
very encouraging and costs are less than estimated, allowing additional
work to be undertaken. The designs for the Klender Sites and Services
Scheme have been completed. Implementation of most technical assistance
components of the project will commence early in 1975. The Bank and
the Government are discussing possibilities to finance the shortfall in
funds for technical assistance, which was caused by the unavailability
of expected bilateral aid.
Loan No. 1049;     Five Cities Water Supply:   US$14.5 Million Loan of
October 31, 1974; Effective Date: May 21, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
The project is about 8-10 months behind schedule due
to administrative and managerial problems. Project costs are expected
to exceed the appraisal estimates by 20-25 percent. Water Enterprises
have now been established in each of the five cities and good progress has
been made in their staffing. The legal steps necessary to clarify the
relationship between these enterprises and the Department concerned of the
central government are being taken.

Loan of November 20, 1974; Effective Date: January 14,
1975; Closing Date: Decemher 31, 1976.
Commitments and disbursements initially were slower
than expected, but they should increase in the second half of FY76. The
progress of this project is satisfactory.
Loan No. 1089:     Second Fertilizer Expansion:   US$115 Million Loan of
February 28, 1975; Effective Date: April 29, 1975;
Closing Date: August 31, 1978.
Work on the project is proceeding satisfactorily.
A potential problem is the availability of gas supplies when the plant
comes into full operation.

Procurement:           Except as noted below, all components of the project
to be financed by the Bank loan, including large-scale
aerial photography (US$4.0 milLion) would be procured
after international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank Group Guidelines. For equipment and mate-
rials a preference of 15 percent or the level of custom
duties, whichever is less, would be provided to quali-
fied local manufacturers.   Small off-the-shelf items,
costing less than $10,000 each, and limited to a total
of $200 would be purchased through normal Government
procedures, which are satisfaci:ory. In addition, some
of the required equipment and materials ($400,000) are
high specialized, patented or compatible with larger
equipment systems, and thus unSuitable for interna-
tional competitive bidding. Such equipment, after the
prior approval of the Bank, would be procured on the
basis of prudent shopping procedures. The civil works
contracts for headquarters bui:lding and facilities
(US$1.4 million) of BAKOSURTAN)AL would be given a 7-1/2
percent preference in bid comparison. There are a
number of local firms who could compete successfully
for this contract.
For the provision of technical services, valued at
US$2.2 million, including the extension of geodetic
control in Kalimantan, photographic processing and
base-map production for Sumatera and Irian Jaya,
qualified individual firms or consortia of firms would
be selected, following procedures acceptable to the Bank.

Technical Assistance:       BAKOSURTANAL would engage internationally
recruited experts in the fields of imagery
analysis, orthophoto production, aero-
nautical charting, cartographic repro-
duction, data handling and resource survey
(ten man-years). In addition, specialist
services for two man-years to meet short-term
needs of BAKOSURTANAL would also be financed
by the proposed Bank Loan.
