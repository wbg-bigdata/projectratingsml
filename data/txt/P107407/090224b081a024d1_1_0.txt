                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, good progress has been made towards setting up and operationalizing the key institutions being established to support the Education Transformation Program. The National
                         Education Inspectorate (NEI), Jamaica Teaching Council (JTC) and National Education Trust (NET) are in place and operational. However, the Bill for JTC is in its final stages and
                         final management arrangements for these institutions are still being put in place and are expected to be finalized by July 2013. The functional profile for the Central Ministry and
                         Department of School Services has been completed and these Agencies continue to operate alongside the old structure until the transition (planned to take place around July 2013)
                         is completed. A capacity building plan is in place and capacity building activities are already being implemented. All the new agencies are allocated resources in the ESTP budget.
