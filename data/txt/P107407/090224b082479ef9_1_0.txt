                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project continues to make good progress towards building capacity of the key institutions established to support the Education System Transformation Program. The National
                         Education Inspectorate (NEI), National Education Trust (NET) and Jamaica Teaching Council (JTC) are in place and continue to operate with specific budget allocations. The
                         capacity of the NEI and the Department of School Services (DSS) is increasing, as evidenced by 85 percent of schools that have been inspected are implementing school
                         improvement plans that reflect recommendations made in NEI school inspections, with the assistance of the DSS (compared to end-of-Project target of 90 percent). The capacity of
                         the JTC and NCEL is also increasing, as evidenced by 92 percent of teachers registered (compared to end-of-Project target of 95 percent) and 10 percent of school principals
                         certified (compared to end-of-Project target of 35 percent). The capacity of the NET is increasing, as evidenced by NET providing project management services to 7 school

                         transition plan for transitioning from the old Ministry structure to the CM and DSS has been completed, and activities under the capacity building plan continue to be implemented.
                         Training in leadership, management, technical competencies, and efficiency has been undertaken for relevant staff in the Ministry. The number of DSS/CM staff trained in their new
                         functions is 134 (compared to end-of-Project target of 180).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A Project restructuring was approved on March 24, 2014, with the following changes and rationale:
                         The closing date of the Education Transformation Capacity Building Project was extended for a period of twelve (12) months from March 31, 2014 (original closing date) to March 31,
                         2015 to allow for installation of National Education Inspection software and disbursement of the remaining funds. The Results Framework was revised in line with the new time line
                         and to better measure the Project Development Objective. One DLT was revised because of its dependency on enactment of JTC legislation by Parliament.

                         Restructuring History
                         Level one Approved on 16-Feb-2012, Level 2 CD Decision on 26-Mar-2014

                         Related Projects
