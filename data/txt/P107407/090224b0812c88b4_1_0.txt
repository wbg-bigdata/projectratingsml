                         loan. All the agencies have been established and and there is good progress towards operationalizing the key institutions being established to support the Education Transformation
                         Program. Planned consultations with staff have all taken place, a capacity building plan is in place and capacity building activities for all the agencies are already being implemented.
                         All the Disbursement Linked Targets (DLTs) for November 2011 were achieved, and there is good progress in implementation of the DLTs for November 2012.
