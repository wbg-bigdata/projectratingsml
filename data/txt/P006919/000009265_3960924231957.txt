FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(LOAN 1845-CR)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fifth
Highway Project in Costa Rica for which Loan 1845-CR in the amount of
US$30.0 million was approved on May 15, 1980. The loan was closed on
December  31,  1986,  three years  behind  schedule.    It was  fully
disbursed and the last disbursement was on October 9, 1987.
The PCR was prepared by Bank staff based on that prepared by
the Borrower and the documentation available in the LAC Information
Center.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED).   The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower by the region for
comments and the minor comments of the Borrower have been incorporated
in the text. Subsequently, OED sent the revised draft to the Borrower
for comments on February 20, 1990. No comments were received.

PROJC  COL       N REPORT
COSTA RICA
FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(IOAN 1845-CR)
EVALUATION SUMIARY
Introduction and Obiective
1.       During the execution of the Fourth Highway Project it became
clex.r MOPT had neglected road maintenance. The backlog of rehabilita-
tion of the main roads increased. With the aim of bringing this situa-
tion under control, the Bank and the Borrower began to consider a
follow-up project focusing primarily on road rehabilitation and main-
tenance in the context of an overall five-year improvement and mainte-
nance program.
2.       The project objectives were to:
-    strengthen the maintenance capacity of the General
Directorate of Highway's (DGV) and improve maintenance
planning and management for the reclassified (expanded)
national network;
-    rehabilitate and improve a number of primary and sec-
ondary roads with outmoded technical characteristics;
and
-support the gradual delegation of maintenance responsi-
bility for the rural roads (from MOPT) to the Cantons.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.       The project got off to a slow start (para. 3.01).   It was
completed about three yeers behind schedule and did not fully achieve
its objectives (para. 6.03).
4.       Because of the financial difficulties faced by the Government
in providing counterpart funds, the project scope was reduced (para.
3.03) and the funds thus freed were used to complete the priority
works on the San Jose-Sequirres road (para. 3.06).
5.       The scope of the Maintenance and Training component of the
project was ambitious and it achieved a mixed success (3.08).



- v -
6.       The maintenance management system to improve road main:enance
operations faced serious implementation delays and is still not fully
operational (para. 3.10).
7.       The Borrower and the executing agency were not able to comply
fully with some of the major convenants for reasons outlined in para-
graphs 4.01 through 4.03.
8.       The project laid the framework for the planning and execution
of road maintenance but suffered from ineffective coordination within
KOPT (para. 5.01).
9.       Another contribution of the project to institutional develop-
ment was the establishment of a Road Rehabilitation and Programming
Unit (RRPU) for the syste3atic programing and execution of rehabili-
tation works (para. 5.02).
Sustaipak i
10.      Rates of return for the completed Road Rehabilitation and
Improvement Program range from 221 to 741 as compared with the apprai-
sal estimated range of 22% to 156X. The largest disparity occurred in
the San Josecito-Naranjo subproject.   Originally this road was to
yield a rate of return of 1561. By project completion, it was esti-
mated that the rate would drop to 54Z. This difference was due pri-
marily to the 204X increase in cost.
Findings and Lessons
11.      The Bank, set ambitious targets for the maintenance of roads
and equipment. Whereas the financial and economic difficulties faced
by the Government (which was the main reason for reducing the scope of
road rehabilitation (para. 3.04)) were largely unforeseen at the time
of appraisal, a fuller appreciation of the institutional shortcomings
of MOPT (para. 3.09) would probably have led to more modest targets
and to smoother project implementation. Additionally, more intensive
involvement of MOPT at the project preparation phase would have con-
tributed to the project's overall success and its sustainability.
12.      The Bank's performance was primarily lackluster in the en-
forcement of covenants aimed at improving MOPT's operations.   There
were 25 district covenants of operational relevance in the Loan Agree-
ment.   It should have been evident right from the start that this
excessive number of covenants was going to be difficult to enforce.
At least during the 1983 reduction in scope of the project, the Bank
should have re-evaluated, in conjunction with MOPT, the objectives it
was trying to achieve through the covenants. By not being selective,
the Bank tried to do too much in too short a time frame and the proj -
ect did not fully achieve its objectives.

PROJECT C0MPLETI0 REIM
COSTA RICA
FIFTH HIGHWAY PRtOJECT
(LO"N 1845-CR)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Transport Sector plays an important role in the economy of
Costa Rica. Although the railway serves some of the banana plantations,
roads are the main mode of internal transportation in Costa Rica.  Road
transport has clear competitive advantage over rail because of the short
transport hauls involved and the absence of large volumes of bulk traffic
*           (suitable for haulage by rail).  Roads account for about 922 of freight
ton-km and 98? of pass-km generated in the country. Overall sector
investments during 1975-88 averaged about 2.2? of the GDP. The sector
added an average of 4.4? to the GDP during this period.
1.02     Bank involvement in the highway subsector began in 1961 with the
First Highway Project (Loan 299-CR/Credit 10-CR) which assisted in defining
the National Highway Program (NHP) and financed the NHP's first stage. It
included maintenance and construction equipment. A second Bank project
(Loan 299-CR) was undertaken in 1970, to link the rich agricultural
hl'iterland between the port of Limon aad Sequirres. The next priority was
to link Sequirres to the capital, San Jose. In order to evaluate the
optimum solution for doing this (all the proposed alignment alternatives
for the road passed through mountainous terrain) the Highway Studies
Project (Loan 872-CR) of 1972 financed the studies for the feasibility of
the improvement/reconstruction of the road and its detailed engineering.
These studies were the technical basis or the Fourth Highway Project (Loan
1187-CR) whose objective was to provide the capital and the Central Valley
(the country's dominant economic region) with a direct link - Limon, as
well as to strengthen MOPT's supervision capabilities.
1.03     Pi tdy as a result of the observed deterioration in road
maintenance which occurred during implementation of the Fourth Highway
Project, the Government adopted new sulisector priorities emphasizing
maintenance of the existing highway network. rehabilitation and impro'e.'ment
of old or inadequate roads and redirecting construction and improvement
works toward rural roads. This desirable shift in priorities recognized
two growing concerns in the country: (i) large parts of the rural roads
serving primarily the rich cattle grazing and agricultural areas (coffee
and fruit) had deteriorated to the extent that access was difficult even
during the dry seasons; and (ii) the main highwavs e.g. the Pan American
and the roads linking the capital to the three main cities in the Central
Valley, were in advanced stages of deterioration. The Fifth Highway
Project was designed to enhance the Government's capability to make the
above mentioned shift and support the Ministry of Public Works and
Transport (MOPT) efforts to reclassify the road network with the objective
of defining the maintenance responsibilities of MOPT and the Cantons
(municipalities). Defining the responsibilities of MOPT and Cantons was
considered an essential first step in laying the foundation for planning
and programming of maintenance works as well as setting up the basis for
realistic budget proposals to carry out the programmed work. In
retrospect, this proved to be an ambitious objective (para. 3.08) and met
with only partial success.



- 2 -
1.04     During project preparation, both the Government and the Bank
realized that in order to achieve the shift away from traditional
construction to  road maintenance implied the preparation an" execution of
many small subprojects. for which the required mix of administrative and
supervision skills was lacking in MuPT. Therefore to support further
institutional strengthening. technical assistance was provided but the
results achieved were mixed. Although MOPT has demonstrated the ability to
formulate institutional goals and policies, the other key element of
institutional development i.e., implementing the goals and policies in
order to achieve the desired results, still needs considerable nurturing.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION. PREPARATION AND OBJECTIVES
2.01     During the execution of the Fourth Highway project it became clear
MOPT had neglected road maintenance. The backlog of rehabilitation of the
main roads increased. With the aim of bringing this situation uwder
control, the bank and the Borrower began to consider a follow-up project
focusing primarily on road rehabilitation and maintenance in the context of
an overall five-year improvement and maintenance program.
2.02     The p,-oject objecLives were to:
-     strengthen the maintenance capacity of the General Directorate of
Highway's (DGV) and improve maintenanice planning and management
for the reclassified (expanded) national network;
-     rehabilitate and improve a number of primary and secondary roads
with outmoded technical characteristics: and
-     support the gradual delegation of maintenance responsibility for
the rural roads (from MOPT) to the Cantons.
2.03     In order to achieve the foregoing obJectives, the project
consisted of:
a) Road Rehabilitation and Improvement
-    rehabilitation or reconstruction (civil works and related
engineering and supervision) of approximately 420 km of
primary and secondary roads as part of the first phase
(1981-1983) of MOPT's Five-Year Program which also had
financing from other sources; and
-    establishment. w.th related technical assistance, of a Road
Rehabilitation Planning Unit in the DGV to plan, evaluate and
program the rehabilitation and improvement of subprojects
included in MOPT's Five-Year Program.
b) Maintenance and Training
-    implementation of MOPT's Maintenance Program (1981-1985) to
ensure adequate maintenance of the reclassified national
network and to assist the Cantons in achieving an acceptable
level of competence for the maintenance on the rural network;



-    implementation of a series of coordinated measures to build
up and upgrade the maintenar._e capability of MOPT, includings
-renewal and limited expansion of the equipment fleet
and supporting facilitiest
-organizational and administrative improvements to
implement a maintenance management system and provision
of related technical assistance; and
-training of approximately 1,500 technical and
administrative personnel, with emphasis on on-the-job
training, and provii ion of related technical assistance.
2.04     The project was appraised in October 1979. Negotiations took place
on April 14, 1980.  There were no outstanding issues.  On May 15, 1980, the
Executive Directors approved a loan ot US$30 million. Project costs, as
presented in the Appraisal Report, are shown on Table 1.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.       Conditions of Effectiveness and Proiect Initiation
3.01     The conditions of loan effectiveness were: (i) the establishment
of the Road Rehabilitation Planning Unit (RRPU) and its staffing with a
senior engineer and a senior economist; and (ii) reclassification of the
network to define the respective maintenance responsibilities of MOPT and
the Cantons. Whereas the Road Planning Unit was established without
significant delays, the approval of the loan and of the enabling
legislation for reclassifying the road network (the Highway Law Amendments)
faced delays in the National Assembly. Seventeen months after Board
approval, the loan and the enabling legislation for reclassifying the
network were approved in September 1981. The loan became effective in
October 1981.
B.       Project Execution
Road Rehabilitation and Improvement Component
3.03     The works were scheduled to begin in the fall of 1981 but lack of
counterpart funds delayed commencement until 1983. Because of the
economic recession of 1981-84, the Government faced considerable fiscal
difficulties and as no significant improvement in the fiscal situation was
apparent. the Borrower and the Bank agreed to reduce the scope %, works
under the project. The Board approved an amendment on June 9, 1983,
reducing the planned rehabilitation of 420 kms to about 180 kms. The
reduced scope freed US$10.3 million in project costs which were reallocated
to the completion of the economically vital San Jose-Sequirres Highway. The
works for this road had begun under the Fourth Highway Project (Loan
1187-CR) but had experienced cost-overruns and delays. The road was only
partially completed. Completion of the road had high priority in view of
the role that the highway plays as the country's most significant
import/export corridor; it accounts for about 70% of Costa Rica's import
and export tonnage.



3.04     The works were executed in two phases to take into account the
Government's limited ability to provide counterpart funds. The first phase
(about 100 km) was executed without major problems. The execution of the
second phase was delayed significantly primarily because of slow and
cumbersome contracting procedures followed by the Government. Contracts
for the 80 kms of works in the second phase were not signed till late 1984.
Insufficient counterpart funds continued to plague the execution of the
second phase through May 1987 t'hen the works were finally completed 19
monthls behind scheduled. The total number of kilometers rehabilitated
during both phases was 180 as agreed under the amendment.
3.05     A local engineering consulting firm provided the field supervision
for the rehabilitation works. Because of MOPT's weak supervision capacity,
the Ministry and the Bank agreed to redefine the consultant's role to
include full responsibility over supervision and financial control of the
works when the scope of rehabilitation was reduced.
3.06     Works on the San Jose-Sequirres road were completed after
resolving several problems which arose during execution. A serious
underestimation of earthworks, nevertheless, led to a cost overrun of
approximately US$8 million dollars. Continuing financial difficulties in
the country ruled out all the needed supplementary assistance from the
Government. The short fall of USS5.4 million needed to complete the works
was eventually funded by the United States Agency for International
Development. The Project Completion Report on the Fourth Highway Project
dated April 17, 1985, reviews critically the implementation problems
arising during execution of the works for this road.
Maintenance and Training Component
3.07     The Maintenance and Training Component sought to develop capacity
for adequate maintenance of the national network and to assist the Cantons
in developing maintenance capability for the rural roads. This component
also sought to strengthen MOPT's own maintenance capabilities through
renewal and expansion of the equipment fleet, provision of technical
assistance for improving the methods and procedures for the management of
maintenance, as well as training of field and headquarters personnel.
3.08     The Maintenance and Training Component was developed based on an
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) financed study carried out by a
consultant consortium in 1981. The same consortium was selected to provide
technical assistance for this component. In retrospect, the scope of this
component was also ambitious. The major issue arising during
implementation was poor coordination as reviewed below although difficult
interpersonal relations between 'he consultants and MOPT staff also
contributed to less than satisfactory achievement of results under this
component.
3.09     In order to upgrade MOPT's equipment fleet, procurement of road
maintenance equipment (US$4 million) and the repair of about 150 units
(US$9,333 per unit) was provided for. However. late in 1982, KOPT adopted
a new policy giving preference to contracting out major equipment overhauls
and doing more periodic road maintenance also on contract. This policy
recognized two shortcomings within MOPT: (a) the Equipment Directorate
charged with equipment overhauls had limited capacity, and (b) MOPT could



- 5-
not execute all the periodic maintenance of roads on force account.
Therefore. MOPT was to concentrate on routine maintenance of roads and
lighter equipment repairs in line with the capacity of its workshops.
Operationally, this meant that the procurement of equipment for heavier
works took on a lower priority. Furthermore, the condition inv-ntory of
maintenance equipment compiled by consultants (para.3.08) had earlier
indicated that several units then in disuse could be
refurbished/rehabilitated economically. Therefore, the proceeds of the
loan marked for procurement were reallocated to refurbishing/rehabilitating
existing units. however, in arriving at this decision, the complex
contracting procedures for equipment rehabilitation and MOPT's cumbersome
bureaucracy were not fully grasped and these contributed to the
unsatisfactory progress achieved. Additionally, frequent changes of the
Directors of the Equipment led to a loss of control over equipment repairs.
By the end of the project, 151 units had been overhauled and 49 units had
been rehabilitated. The total cost for the 200 units was US$6.5 million,
an increase of 25O0 in per-unit cost (US$32,500 per unit as compared with
the appraisal estimated US$9,300 per-unit cost). A pa-t of the explanation
for the increase in costs was the practice of cannibalizing the units
scheduled for repairs to keep the other equipment functioning. Thus, by
the time these units arrived in the workshops. their rehabilitation/
refurbishing were already greater than the estimates in the condition
inventory carried out by consultants.
3.10     The technical assistance provided under this com:.onent developed a
maintenance management system for maintenance planning, programming and
evaluation of road maintenance. The technical assistance also designed the
reorganization of the General Directorate of Maintenance (DGM) giving it
responsibility for all maintenance activities. But DGM's authority was not
clearly defined. Over a year after DGM's reorganization, maintenance
activities continued to be controlled by the DGV via regional engineers
because DGM was unable to coordinate maintenance activities in the field.
When DGM did gain control, it continued to be burdened with ambiguous
authority to carry-out its functions. As a result, the maintenance
management system designed to guide field personnel in scheduling,
directing, reporting and controlling maintenance operations faced serious
implementation delays and is still not fully operational. The proposed
Transport Sector Project provides for full implementation of the
maintenance management system.
3.11     The training provided under the project showed mixed rest'lts as
well. The General Directorate of Training (DGA) was successful in training
mid-level personnel. However, long delays in government processing of
procurement for training equipment hindered efforts to train field
personnel. Out of 970 MOPT road and equipment maintenance personnel
originally scheduled to be trained from 1981 through 1985. only 230
received the training. The program itself did not start until early 1983.
Additionally, the overall quality of the courses was less than
satisfactory. Of the originally allocated US$0.9 million, only US$0.1
million was used for training of field personnel.
Other
3.12     Although not foreseen during appraisal, a computer system was
purchased late in 1983 with funds from Category 9 (created by the Loan



- 6 -
Amendment dated December 6, 1982) at a final cost of US$0.6 million, to
allow MOPT to improve the technical aspects of maintenance and to implement
the maintenance management system. The benefits yielded from the use of
this equipment were marginal and, as mentioned above, the maintenance
management system is still not fully operational.
IV. COMPLIANCE WITH THE MAJOR COVENANTS
4.01     The main thrust of the covenants was to enable MOPT to better
manage its operations and enhance the project's sustainability. However,
despite the appointment of a full time project coordinator, it would seem
that the mid-level management within MOPT viewed compliance with large
number of covenants more as Bank's bureaucratic requirements than the tools
to improve the efficiency of the Ministry's operations: there were 25 major
covenants in the Loan Agreement. Only since 1987 (with the creation within
MOPT of a General Directorate of External Financing reporting to the
Director General of Public Works, MOPT's Chief Engineer. and the
reorganization of the maintenance entities) has the mid-level management
begun to appreciate that the purpose of the main covenants, was to improve
the ineffective administrative structure of MOPT.
4.02     The main covenants pertained to (a) the adequate funding (Section
3.01(a)) and satisfactory execution of the agreed maintenance program
(Section 3.01(b)); (b) classification of the equipment fleet according to
whether it was used to maintain the National or the Cantonal roads
(Section 3.05(d)) and preparation of detailed programs for the maintenance
of roads in the regional directorates according to whether they were
classified as National or Cantonal (Section 3.05); (c) maintenance of
records for project progress monitoring (Section 3.10(b)) and establishing
a cost accounting system to enable cl.ar determination of costs for the
various maintenance and rehabilitatioa activities on the National and
Cantonal roads (Section 4.02(b)); (d) adequate maintenance of the equipment
fleet (Sections 4.03(c) and (d)) and establishment of appropriately
equipped workshops and spare parts inventories for timely maintenance of
the equipment fleet: (e) the devolution of maintenance responsibilities for
the Cantonal roads to the Cantons (Section 4.04(b)); and (f) the
enforcement of vehicle dimensions and weights regulations (Section 4.06(a)
and (b). In addition to overall poor project coordination, confusion over
the objectives of the covenants were mainly responsible for the mixed
compliance.
4.03     Continuing difficulties with local funds and the ill defined
responsibilities for the maintenance of roads through 1987 clearly
compromised full compliance with Sections 3.01(a) and (b) of the Loan
Agreement as discussed in Section III of this PCR. Weak management and
frequent changes at the level of Director in the Equipment Maintenance
Directorate were largely responsible for partial compliance (para. 3.09 and
3.10) with Sections 3.05(d). 3.06, 4.03(c) and 4.03(d) of the Loan
Agreement. Full compliance with Sections 3.10(b) and 4.02(b) was hindered
by MOPT's own buresucratic procedures and prevailing norms for cost
accounting which, while adequate for keeping track of MOPT's budget in
broad categories, had little operational relevance. The maintenance
management system established the basis for clearly accounting for the



various maintenance and rehabilitation activities, but since it is still
not fully operational (para. 3.10), the budget costs allocated to the
various activities and those actually experienced are difficult to
reconcile accurately. The main reason for less than full compliance with
Section 4.04(b) of the Loan Agreement was that the devolution of
maintenance responsibilities to the Cantons is a politically sensitive
issue. The Cantons remain reluctant to assume responsibility for the
maintenance of their roads in the absence of appropriate changes in revenue
sharing with the Go-ernment. And lastly, the enforcemeu;t of vehicle
dimensions and weight regulations, despite earlier compliance, has come to
a standstill since early 1986 for lack of funds to repair the broken down
weigh bridges.
V.   INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER
5.01     The project laid the framework for planning and execution of road
maintenance but suffered most from ineffective coordination within MOPT.
Planning and programming tools such as the maintenance management system.
although not fully operational, laid the foundatitn for systematic delivery
of road maintenance services.   Nonetheless. frequent changes of top level
personnel, particularly in the DGM, and lukewarm support for improving the
efficiency of maintenance operations on the part of some of the Directors
as well as continuing budgetary constrains are responsible to a large
extent for the less than satisfactory improvement in the overall
maintenance situation. A significant institutional development in road
maintenance occurred in 1987 when the entities responsible for road
maintenance and equipment were reorganized, their responsibilities
redefined and their status raised within MOPT's organizational hierarchy.
The newly created Sub-Division of Maintenance (SDM) and the Sub-Division of
Equipment (SDE) now report to MOPT's Chief Engineer. the Director General
of the Public Works Division, thus providing the basis for the effective
coordination of maintenance and reducing the scope for internal conflicts
which contributed to the mixed success of the project. In retrospect, if
the Borrower had implemented this reorganization earlier, costs could have
been contained. particularly for completing the rehabilitation of equipment
(para. 3.09) and delays could have been reduced in improving the management
of maintenance (para. 3.10).
5.02     The establishment of the RRPU within DGV was another contribution
to institutional development for the systematic programming and execution
of rehabilitation works. The unit was later transferred to the General
Directorate of Planning.  This unit's personnel training was completed and
the personnel acquired the planned level of competency to perform
effectively. Unfortunately the units programming responsibilities were
absorbed by the Division of Public Works within DGV; thereby weakening this
unit.
VI.  PERFORMANCE OF THE BANK
6.01     Bank performance was less than satisfactory although the Bank was
responsive in resolving the implementation problems as they arose. A case
in point in support of the latter is the sensitivity shown by the Bank in
responding to the financial difficulties faced by the Government and the
subsequent reduction in the scope of the project to accommodate the limited



capability of the Government for providing counterpart funds. Another case
in point is the allocation of funds freed by the reduction in project scope
to the completion of the San Jose-Sequirres Highway. Bank performance
could have been better if a miore penetrating evaluation of MOPT's
institutional weaknesses had been undertaken during appraisal or at least
during the process of amending the project. The Bank focus during
supervision appears to have been on finding engineering solutions to
implementation problems and it appears that the institutional issues
received less attention. With a prior history cf cost overruns and
implementation delays, the Bank should have paid more attention to
improving MOPT's organizational performance and developing its management
capacity.
6.02     The Bank, set ambitious targets for the maintenance of roads and
equipment. Whereas the financial and economic difficulties faced by the
Government (which was the main reason for reducing the scope of road
rehabilitation (para. 3.04)) were largely unforeseen at the time of
appraisal, a fuller appreciation of the institutional shortcomings of MOPT
(para. 3.09) would probably have led to more modest targets and to smoother
project implementation. Additionally, more intensive involvement of MOPT
at the project preparation phase would have contributed to the project's
overall success and its sustainability.
6.03     The Bank's performance was particularly lackluster in the
enforcement of covenants aimed at improving MOPT's operations. There were
25 distinct covenants of operational relevance in the Loan Agreement. It
should have been evident right from the start that this excessive number of
covenants was going to be difficult to enforce. At least during the 1983
reduction in scope of the project, the Bank should have re-evaluated, in
conjunction with MOPT, the objectives it was trying to achieve through the
covenants. By not being selective, the Bank tried to do too much in too
short a time frame and the project did not fully achieve its objectives.
VII. PROJECT COSTS AND DISBURSEMENTS
7.01     The project was amended in 1983 and its scope was reduced (para.
3.03). Therefore the comparison of costs which follows is for illustrative
purposes. Table 1 shows that the appraisal estimated project cost of
US$43.3 million compared with the actual cost of US$43.1 million
experienced at completion. Overall, the apprsioal estimated costs of the
two major components, Road Rehabilitation and Improvements and Road
taintenance of the national network also did not change appreciably from
those experienced at project completion. Although the difference between
the appraisal estimated total costs and those experienced at completion are
less than 1Z, there are significant cost variations among the subcomponents
for reasons explained in Section III of this PCR.
7.02     The appraisal estimated total cost of the Road Rehabilitation and
Improvement component was US$33.6 million of which the rehabilitation sub-
component of 417 km was estimated at US$31.7 million or about US$76,000 per
km. At completion the cost was US$33.3 milliot of which the Bank financed
US$21.3 million (64Z). The actual cost of the road rehabilitation sub-
component. after reduction of scope to 180 kms. was US$13.7 million or
about US$79,000 per km. which represented a modest unit cost increase of 4t



over the appraisal estimate. For the completion of the San Jose-Sequirres
road. the estimated cost of US$10.3 million (para. 3.04) when the project
was amended compares unfavorably with the US$18.4 million actually
experienced. Despite the significant cost overrun (attributed largely to
the underestimation of quantities) the San Jose-Sequirres, the road was
economically justified as explained in the PCR on the Fourth Highway
Project dated April 17, 1985.
7.03     Concerning the maintenance and training component of the project,
the appraisal estimated cost was about the same as actually experienced,
i.e. US$9.7 million vs. US$9.1 million. The Bank financed 912 of the
overall cost vs. the appraisal estimate of 92X. The largest sub-component.
procurement of equipment, was reallocated to rehabilitation of existing
maintenance equipment (para. 3.09).
VIII. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
8.01     The Borrower performed the ex-post economic analysis of the
completed project using the same methodology used at the time of appraisal.
The model used for the analysis was the Highway Design and Maintenance
Model III. which takes into account the geometrics, terrain type, physical
characteristics and condition of the roadway, maintenance policies, traffic
volumes, and based on these, computes road user savings. The original ex-
post evaluation was performed in May 1987. In September of the same year,
the Borrower prepared a revised analysis to take into account the Bank's
comments.
8.02     Rates of return for the completed Road Rehabilitation and
Improvement Program are shown in Table 2 and these range from 22Z to 74Z as
compared with the appraisal estimated range of 22Z to 156Z. The largest
disparity occurred in the San Josecito-Naranjo subproject.  Originally,
this road was to yield a rate of return of 1562. By project completion, it
was estimated that the rate would drop to 54?. This difference was due
primarily to the 2041 increase in cost.
IX.   CONCLUSIONS
9.01     Although at the time of Board presentation, Costa Rica was in a
period of economic prosperity, the economy deteriorated significantly
between 1981-84 with serious repercussions on the Government's revenues.
This created the crisis in the availability of counterpart funds which
played a major role in the Borrower and the Bank's decision to reduce the
scope of the roads to be rehabilitated from 420 km to about 180 kms, and
the addition of the San Jose-Sequirres road to the project works which were
paralyzed because of lack of funds to complete the remaining sections.
9.02     The works under the project were completed and the quality of the
completed works is considered to be satisfactory. The progress of project
execution was affected by lack of counterpart funds, ineffective
coordination and cumbersome procurement procedures. The less than
satisfactory results, particularly of the maintenance equipment
rehabilitation component, are partly attributed to this. When the decision
was made to allocate funds from equipment procurement to refurbishing/
rehabilitating existing units (para.3.09), the Borrower's local procurement



- 10 -
procedures should have been evaluated carefully and the required amendments
sought for ensuring the component's success. Difficulties also arose in
completing the San Jose-Sequirres road.
9.03     The !mxecution of the Maintenanre and Training component ran into
major difficulties and the overall results are considered less than
satisfactory. During much of the project execution period, the authority
and responsibilities of the various divisions within MOPT continued to be
ill defined and as a result, project coordination suffered and the
maintenance operations were not administered well. In retrospect, a
critical evaluation of MOPT's institutional shortcomings during appraisal
(or at least during the project amendment process) should have been made
and remedial solutions incorporated in the project in order to ensure
reasonable probability for achieving its objectivez. The project's
objectives were overly ambitious in relation to MOPT's administrative and
managerial capabilities.
9.04     MOPT and the consultants providing the technical assistance under
the maintenance component were unable to develop a productive relationship.
The unsatisfactory Borrower-technical assistance relationship also impeded
progress of the training for equipment operators and mechanics.
9.05     MOPT's compliance with the major covenants of the Loan Agreement
was mixed for the reasons outlined in the paragraph 4.03. While the
covenants were clearly focused on achieving operationally relevant targets,
the Bank seems to have tried to do too much in too short a space of time in
the prevailing environment of fragmented decision making in MOPT.
Particularly with regard to making the Cantons financially and
operationally responsible for the maintenance of Cantonal roads, the Bank
seems to have underestimated the complexity of the problems it sought to
resolve through legal covenants. Thus, while legally the maintenance
responsibilities were reallocated between MOPT and the Cantons, the overall
state of road maintenance has not improved significantly. A clear lesson
from this project is that lasting institutional changes need a carefully
designed longer term strategy to which the Borrower should be fully
committed.
