INDONESIA
FOURTEENTH POWER PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:          Republic of Indonesia
Beneficiary:       Nationial Electricity Authority (PLN)
Amount:            US$210.0 million equivalent (including the capitalized
front end fee)
Terms:             Repayable in 20 years including 5 years' grace, at the
standard variable interest rate
Onlending
Terms:             The proceeds of the loan will be onlent from the Government
of Indonesia (GOI) to PLN for 20 years including a grace
period of 5 years; the onlending rate will be equal to the
Bank's standard variable interest rate plus no less than a
quarter percent for administration charges. The GOI will
bear the foreign exchange risk.
Project
Description:       The project supports the twin objectives of the expansion
of power supply facilities in Indonesia to meet the demand
and the development of alternate sources in the energy
sector by the construction of 2 x 400 MW coal fired units 3
and 4 at Suralaya steam power plant in West Java. It also
includes expansion of the distribution facilities in East
and Central Java and in the Jabotabek (Jakarta, Bogor,
Tangerang and Bekasi) area. About 400,000 residential
consumers in urban and rural areas will receive supply.
Simultaneously, the project will address the institutional
development needs of PLN. Consulting services for hydro-
power and transmission development are also included.
There is a risk of delay in the Suralaya project due to a
delay in finalizing the critical steam generator contract
or constraints on local funds. Suitable agreements have
been reached with the Government and PLN to reduce these
risks. There is no unusual risk associated with the
distribution component of the project.

I. THE EvMERGY SECTOR AND ELECTRICITY SUBSECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      Indonesia is richly endowed with energy resources including oil,
natural gas, coal, hydropower and geothermal energy. Oil and natural gas now
account for almost all of total commercial energy consumption. While undis-
covered oil reserves are estimated at 10-40 billion barrels, proven resources
are 9.5 billion barrels. Unless massive new reserves are discovered, produc-
tion capacity is unlikely to increase beyond 1.9 million barrels per day. GOI
has therefore adopted a policy of promoting alternative indigenous energy
sources-
Natural Gas
1.02      The estimated natural gas reserve is 69 trillion cu ft (TCF) -  of
which 85% is non-associated and can be developed independently of oil. How-
ever, reserves are generally located away from population and industrial
centers.  The Arun field in North Sumatra has 17 TCF and Natuma  in the South
China Sea, 35 TCF. Production of natural gas reached 998 million cu ft in
1979. Half of this was exported as LNG to Japa%,from Arun and Badak. LNG
production is expected to double by 1985 to 15 ' million tons per year and to
reach 28 million tons by 1990. Gas pipelines have been laid to domestic steel
and fertilizer factories and domestic consumption is expected to increase by
15% every year.
Coal
1.03      Indonesia's coal reserves are believed to be as high as 20 billion
tons, mostly located in West and South Sumatra and Kalimantan. While produc-
tion is currently about 450,000 tons per year, major increases are planned by
GOI. Coal will become the major source of fuel for the power sector as major
thermal plants come on line in the 1980s. Work started early in 1982 on a
3.0 million ton per year mine at Bukit Asam in South Sumatra and on a 0.6 mil-
lion ton per year mine at the nearby Muara Tiga coal field. Muara Tiga has
reserves to permit an increase in production to 2.5 million tons per year by
1990. A program to raise the coal production at Ombilin in West Sumatra to
1.3 million tons per year is also being implemented by GOI. In addition, in
1981, GOI entered into a number of production-sharing agreements with private
foreign and Indonesian joint-venture companies for exploration and exploita-
tion of Kalimantan coal reserves. Exploration is now in progress.
1/   1 TCF of gas = 24.7 million tons of oil equivalent.
2/   1 ton of LNG = 1.2 tons of oil equivalent.



-2-
Hydroelectric
1.04      Indonesia's total hydroelectric resources are large but development
is limited by their geographic distribution relative to demand. The greatest
potential (over 35%) lies in Irian Jaya where the demand is less than one per-
cent of total domestic demand, while Java, which accounts for 80% of the cur-
rent demand, has less than 10% of the total potential. Existing hydroelectric
installations aggregate to 1,312 MW; they are located mainly in Java (489 MW),
Sumatra (612 MW), and Sulawesi (181 MW). Schemes with an aggregate capacity
of about 1,500 MW are currently under construction. PLN assisted by Nippon
Koei of Japan has carried out a systematic countrywide resource survey using
funds from IBRD Loan 1365-IND, which has led to an inventory of hydroelectric
sites, which is being followed up with various prefeasibility and feasibility
studies of the promising hydroelectric sites; prefeasibility studies of
21 such hydro schemes and feasibility studies for five schemes are also being
financed under Loan 1365-IND. In addition, prefeasibility studies for
20 sites and feasibility studies for 6 sites will be financed under Loan 2300-
IND.
Geothermal
1.05      Surface manifestations of geothermal energy are found on all islands
except Kalimantan, but only a few sites have been investigated and only one,
Kamojang in West Java, has been delineated. It is believed that potential
reserves may approach 10,000 MW distributed as follows: Java 5,500 MW;
Sulawesi 1,400 MW; Sumatra 1,100 MW; other islands 2,000 MW. GOI, in colla-
boration with the Government of New Zealand, initiated development of Kamojang
field in 1976. The first 30 MW generating set was commissioned for commercial
operation in January 1983; the twelfth power project (Loan 2214-IND) provides
for the expansion of the station by 110 MW. In 1982, PERTAMINA (The National
Oil and Gas Company) entered into a joint operation contract with Union Geo-
thermal, a subsidiary of Union Oil of California, for development of the Salak
field in West Java. Exploration is in progress. GOI has announced its inten-
tion to lease other sites to successful bidders, to accelerate the development
of geothermal energy.
Institutions in the Energy Sector
1.06      The principal agency responsible for the implementation of GOI
policies in the energy sector is the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME).  IME
was established in 1978 to coordinate all activities in the energy sector and
control the three state enterprises responsible for the execution of GOI poli-
cies in the energy subsectors; PERTAMINA for oil and gas, P.N. BATUBARA for
coal and PLN for electricity. Other ministries and agencies are also involved
in the sector: for example, Public Works primarily deals with hydropower
resource surveys, Agriculture oversees forestry products, and the National
Atomic Energy Commission is responsible for nuclear development. In order to
ensure appropriate coordination of energy policy an inter-ministerial National
Energy Board (BAKOREN) to oversee sectoral development was established. It is
also proposed to establish an energy planning unit in the MME; a decision for
its establishment is expected soon.



-3-
Bank Role and Strategy
1.07      The Bank has been actively involved in some of the sectoral develop-
ments described above. During 1981, at the invitation of GOT the Bank/UNDP
carried out a detailed assessment of the Indonesian energy sector, identifying
policy options and analyzing investment priorities to provide a framework for
technical assistance and advice to GOI on institutional aspects. The results
have been incorporated in a report (No. 3543, November 1981) entitled
"Indonesia: Issues and Options in the Energy Sector." This report confirmed
earlier findings that alternatives for oil must be developed quickly for
electricity generation, and recommended that this strategy should be extended
to industry, transportation and households. It further pointed out that
subsidized oil prices, weak institutions, manpower shortages and a lack of
detailed energy sector planning were the chief obstacles to rapid substitution
of oil.
1.08      Subsidized petroleum product prices caused serious distortions in
the economy by failing to reflect the opportunity cost of these products. The
effects of this have been to favor the use of oil over other competing fuels,
to promote domestic consumption over exports and, because the degree of sub-
sidy between oil products was uneven, to distort demand between individual
petroleum products. The Bank has had a continuous dialogue with GOI on the
question and has highlighted the consequences of this policy through its
economic and sector work. In 1983, the Bank prepared a study entitled
"Indonesia-Selected Issues of Energy Pricing Policy" (Report No. 4285-IND) to
analyse the policy options and their implications. In the last three years,
OI has taken bold steps to increase the domestic price of petroleum fuels,
the last being in January 1984, increasing average prices by 35%, which fol-
lowed increases of about 60% each in January 1982 and 1983. These have now
eliminated the differential between average domestic prices and the average
economic price. Currently the prices for aviation fuel and regular gasoline
are 125% and 150% of international levels, the prices of diesel and fuel oil
are slightly above the international levels whereas the price for kerosene is
about 64% of the international level (Annex 17, Table 3). The weighted aver-
age of domestic prices is now about the same as the average international
price of a comparable bundle of petroleum products. The coal pricing issue
was addressed under the Bukit Asam project (Loan 2079-IND), wherein it was
agreed that Bukit Asam coal would be priced at no less than 80% of the inter-
national price for comparable coal.
1.09      The Bank is also providing assistance for institutional development
in the energy sector. Under the seventh power project (Loan 1513-IND) a con-
sultant, PA International of the UK, designed a management information system
for all activities of the Directorate General of Electric Power (DGEP) which
will be implemented during the next three years. In addition, a iLumber of
assistance efforts have been devised for PLN in such important areas as
planning, construction, accounting, manpower development and training, and are
mostly financed with Bank funds (para. 3.05). Furthermore, in the coal
subsector, various steps are being initiated for institutional and manpower
development under Bank-assisted projects: the Bukit Asam Coal Mining
Development and Transportation Project (Loan 2079-IND) and the Coal
Exploration Engineering Project (Loan 2153-IND).



1.10      The magnitude of investments necessary to implement GOI's policy of
diversification of energy sources is large. The Bank has estimated that the
annual investments in the energy sector will increase from about $1.27 billion
in 1980 to about $10 billion (at 1980 levels) in the year 2000. About half of
these will be directly in the electricity subsector. The Bank's lending stra-
tegy for energy is to continue its support for the investment program in the
electricity and coal subsectors during the next few years with a focus on
steps to strengthen the institutions and develop manpower resources. Addi-
tionally, future projects may be developed in city gas/LPG production and
natural gas utilization to assist GOI's energy diversification policy. Stu-
dies for gas/LPG production and natural gas utilization are being financed
under the Fifth Technical Assistance Project (Credit 898-IND).
The Electricity Subsector
1.11      The electricity subsector is regulated by MME through the DGEP.  It
comprises (a) PLN, (b) captive plants installed by private parties for their
own use, (c) some small municipal franchises, and (d) a small number of
cooperatives which were set up to provide electricity in certain rural areas
remote from PLN supply systems. Legislation was enacted in 1979 to provide
for private and cooperative franchise participation in the electricity sector.
PLN's Organization
1.12      PLN is a public corporation (Perum) constituted under Presidential
Decree No. 18 of 1972, with responsibility for the generation, transmission
and distribution of electricity and the planning, construction and operation
of electricity supply facilities. PLN is managed by a board of directors
headed by a President Director, who is appointed by the President and is
accountable to the Minister of Mines and Energy. The President Director has
authority for all day-to-day operations of PLN. The board currently includes
five other directors with functional responsibility respectively for planning,
construction, operations, finance and administration. Operational responsi-
bility devolves to 17 regions, and responsibility for major construction to
14 project managers. Also reporting to the board are several staff units
responsible for power research, education and training, management services,
an audit unit called the Corporation Inspectorate, and the Java system opera-
tion and control unit.
OLN's Facilities
1.13      PLN is the dominant executive agency in the electricity subsector.
In 1983, it had 3,253 MW of installed generating capacity - 1,356 MW of steam
(oil fired), 787 MW of gas turbines, 502 MW of diesel, 578 MW in hydroelectric
and 30 MW of geothermal (para. 2.02). PLN also operates over 8,000 km of
transmission lines at 70 and 150 kV and about 35,000 km of distribution lines,
the bulk of which are in Java. Java now has a fully interconnected grid at
150 kV. By early 1985, a 500 kV system covering West and Central Java will be
commissioned; it will be extended to East Java by 1987.



-5-
PLN's Market
1.14      A study to assess potential demand in Java (which presently accounts
for about 80% of total electricity consumption) was undertaken in 1974-76 by
Preece Cardew and Rider Consultants (PCR) of the U.K. financed under Credit
399-IND. It showed that the underlying demand was so large that PLN's sales
growth would be limited only by its ability to supply until about 1990; only
thereafter would it be limited by growth of the market itself. From 1976/77
to 1981/82, PLN's sales increased annually by an average of about 21%. The
sales growth in 1982/83 slowed to 16%, partly due to economic recession and
part'y due to budgetary constraints which slowed down the program of connec-
tion of new consumers. Long waiting lists for new service connections and the
relatively low level of electrification are such as to sustain a high rate of
growth of sales; the system is still supply constrained. The present projec-
tions are that PLN's sales will grow at an average rate of 19 to 20% p.a. for
about five years and then gradually slow down to about 16% p.a. (para. 2.06).
Long-Term Development Plan
1.15      PLN follows a practice of preparing a long term development plan to
cover the projected requiremuents of generation, transmission, distribution and
other facilities. The latost plan reviewed by the Bank in December 1983,
covering the development period 1983/84 to 1993/94, shows generating capacity
increasing from 3,253 MW in 1982/83 to over 14,000 MW in 1993/94. The major
growth will be achieved by the construction of coal fired thermal, hydro and
geothermal plants, reducing the share of oil-based electricity generation from
81% currently to about 27% in 1993/94 (para. 2.07).  It is a balanced program
which supports a vital part of the GOI's objective of reducing the domestic
usage of oil. The total investment for the program is estimated to be about
$21.0 billion in constant 1983 prices; the investment requirements will rise
from $1.0 billion in 198zj83 to $2.5 billion in 1993/94 (Annex 1). While the
demand for electricity exists and PLN appears capable of expanding its organi-
zation to implement such a program, a major constraint may develop in mobi-
lizing the required finances ic the macroeconomic situation does not improve
within the next 2 or 3 years. The program objectives will therefore have to
be kept under continuous review, though the development targets have been
approved by the Government. The Bank is proposing a detailed review of the
PLN's investment program in 1984/85 (para. 2.08).
1.16      In order to achieve the objective of rapid electrification and
ensure soundness of the development program, the Bank has the following agree-
ments with the GOI and PLN, which will be continued in the proposed loan:
(a)  PLN will prepare, review with the Bank and implement a customer
connection program each year;
(b)  PLN and GOI will review annually with the Bank PLN's development
plan and investme-.t budget to enable the Bank to express its views
on the priorities and the balance among the generation, transmission
and distribution investments; and



- 6 -
(c)  The Government will provide sufficient funds to finance PLN's
capital expenditures as reviewed and agreed with the Bank.
Bank's Earlier Operations and PLN's Performance
1.17      Since 1969, for a total of thirteen projects, the Bank Group has
provided $1,869 million for power generation, transmission and distribution
facilities. Four distribution projects (Credits 165-IND and 334-IND, and
Loans 1259-IND and 2056-IND) rehabilitated and expanded the distribution
facilities in the greater Jakarta area. Nine power projects (Credit 399-IND
and Loans 1127-IND, 1365-IND, 1513-IND, 1708-IND, 1872-IND, 1950-IND, 2214-
IND, and 2300-IND) -nere undertaken to help PLN expand electricity generation
capacity in Java, to provide a strong all-Java 500 kV grid, to reduce system
transmission and distribution losses and to introduce a program of mini hydro
development in Sumatra. PPAR's on the first two projects (Credits 165-IND and
334-IND) have been issued and the lessons learned from these operations have
been applied to subsequent operations. They relate mainly to timely appoint-
ment of consultants, effective supervision, and lending as late as possible in
the project cycle. PCR for the third and the fourth power project has been
completed and tl-e PPAR for them is under finalization.
1.18      PLN's implementation capacity has grown vastly since the Bank's
early association with it. All Bank financed projects have been or are being
implemented as designed and have generally been within the estimated cost.
However, delays of the order of six months to two years in implementation have
been experienced compared to the appraisal estimates (paras. 1.19 and 1.20).
Growing size and complexity of the projects coupled with cumbersome Government
procedures for the award of contracts, opening of letters of credit, budget
approvals etc. have been responsible for most delays. It is also relevant to
note that the implementation schedules for the Bank financed projects have
generally been optimised to international standards with little slack to
accommodate procedural delays.
1.19      The earliest generation project (Credit 399-IND) covering 2 x 100 MW
units at Muara Karang was completed about two years behind schedule. The sub-
sequent extensions of this plant (Loan 1127-IND and 1365-IND) were completed
about one year late. Extension of the Semarang power station by a 200 MW unit
(Loan 1513-IND) was about 18 months behind the appraisal schedule; the con-
struction of a new coal/oil fired station with 2 x 400 MW units (Loans 1708-
IND and 1872-IND) is about ten months late for the first unit and about six
months late for the second unit.
1.20      Two large hydro projects at Saguling (700 MW) and Cirata (500 MW)
are being funded by Loans 1°50-IND and 2300-IND.  Physical progress of con-
struction at Saguling was poor at the start but is now proceeding satisfacto-
rily. Completion of the Saguling dam is expected close to the appraisal tar-
get though the commissioning of the power station will be delayed by about six
months due to landslide problems in the power house area and delay in tunnel
constructions. The start of construction of the main civil works of Cirata
project (Loan 2300-IND) was delayed by four months due to delay in the
Government approval of the Consultants contract for construction supervision,
though all major construction contracts were awarded in time.



1.21      Progress of implementation of transmission and distribution covered
by the eleventh power project (Loan 2056-IND) is satisfactory. Also the pro-
gress of various components of the twelfth power project (Loan 2214-IND) such
as Kamojang Geothermal, the loss reduction program and mini hydro projects is
satisfactory; however, the implTmentation of Suralaya Unit No. 3 is delayed
due to financing constraints (para. 4.16).
II.  THE POWER MARKET AND THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
Present Consumption and Access to Service
2.01      The per capita electricity consumption in Indonesia in 1983 was only
about 115 kWh, which is almost a third of that in Thailand and the Philip-
pines. Only about 10% of all households have electricity; the degree varies
from about 12% in Java, to about 10% in Kalimantan and Sulawesi, 8% in Sumatra
and 6% in the other islands. PLN's share of total electricity production
which was about 50% until 1977/78, grew to 67% by 1982/83. In Java, PLN now
accounts for about 74% of the market. PLN's total sales in 1982/83 were 9,101
GWh out of which 7,217 GWh (79.3%) were in Java.
PLN's Installed Capacity
2.02      PLN's total installed capacity by end 1982/83 was 3,253 MW, out of
which 2,458 MW (76%) was in Java. Nearly 81% of the capacity uses petroleum
fuels. Table 2.1 shows the breakdown of the generating capacity in Java and
outside Java.

Power Market Survey
2.03      A detailed power market survey for Java carried out in 1974-76
(para. 1.14) concluded that growth in the short and medium terms depended on
the rate at which PLN could build up supply facilities. After detailed review
of the various aspects, including the necessity of rapid growth in PLN's



- 8 -
institutional capability, an agreement was reached between the Bank and GOI in
1978 on the sales forecasts to be adopted in Java for planning purposes up to
1990. Also, as a necessary instrument of meeting its sales targets, PLN
agreed with the Bank that it would prepare, discuss with the Bank and actively
implement each year a consumer connection program consistent with its
improving capabilities. As a consequence, the number of consumers grew from
1.2 million in 1976/77 to 3.8 million in 1982/83 and sales grew from 3,082 GWh
to 9,101 GWh in the same period, which is a compound rate of growth of over
21% for consumers and 20.0% for sales. Annex 2 gives the details. The sales
growth in Java for the same period was from 2,500 GWh to 7,217 GWh, an average
rate of 19.3% p.a.
2.04      In the tenth powt. project (Loan 1950-IND), PLN agreed to build its
own expertise for the power market survey and demand forecasting. It has set
up a section for this purpose which is assisted by Preece Cardew and Rider
(PCR) of the U.K., who were the consultants for the Java study in 1974-76.
Work on surveys and building up of an information system commenced in mid-
1983, in which the headquarters as well as the wilayahs (regions) are invol-
ved. The demand forecasts on short and medium term will be constructed by
microsurveys and the long-term projections will be reconciled with macro-
economic projections. This effort is expected to lead to the first set of
revised projections by the end of 1984 which will then be updated annually.
2.05      An agreement has been reached with the Government that it will
furnish to the Bank by December 31, 1984, procedures to ensure coordination of
relevant departments and agencies such as PLN, MNE, BAPPENAS, etc. in provid-
ing policy guidance to PLN's power market survey group and reviewing and
approving forecasts prepared by them, so that such demand forecasts form the
basis of PLN's long-term planning.
Projection of PLN's Sales
2.06      During the appraisal of the proposed project, the Bank mission
reviewed the forecasts for Java based on the preliminary information compiled
by the power market survey group of PLN, assisted by PCR. Forecasts for
electricity sales in Java for short and medium terms were constructed with the
available data of (a) connection program of residential consumers; (b) waiting
list of industrial consumers; (c) program for changeover of captive generation
to PLN supply and (d) an assumption of an average GDP growth of 5% p.a. It
was concluded that the sales in 1983/84 are likely to fall short of PLN's
forecasts on account of a slowdown in the connection program due to budgetary
constraints and material shortages as well as general economic recession.
However, it was concluded that the unsatisfied potential demand contributed by
factors (a), (b) and (c) was still large and a high rate of growth in demand
would continue if supply facilities are suitably expanded. Annex 3 shows the
projections which are considered reasonable.
Long-Term Development Plan
2.07      During the appraisal of the proposed project in December 1983, PLN's
development plan (para. 1.15) was reviewed, taking into account the latest
status of ongoing projects. The generation programs for Java and other



- 9 -
islands are summarized in Annexes 4 and 5. Table 2.2 summarizes the expected
generating capacity in 1993/94. Annex 1 contains the corresponding investment
requirements.

2.08      The physical features of the investment program in Java and the
balance between generation, transmission and distribution facilities are fully
justified. Also PLN should be able to implement the program substantially,
given the necessary financial resources if it continues to maintain the
impressive progress of its institutional growth. The same confidence cannot
be extended to the proposed investment in the rural electrification program,
which is not based on sufficiently detailed studies. Also the investment
program outside Java has not been reviewed in depth by the Bank for its
optimality. It is proposed to carry out a detailed review of PLN's investment
program in 1984/85 to address these and other issues such as role of captive
generation and rural energy needs.
III.  THE BENEFICIARY
Status, Responsibilities and Organization
3.01      The borrower of the proposed loan would be the Government of
Indonesia (GOI) and the beneficiary would be PLN, the wholly government-owned
public utility in Indonesia.
3.02      PLN was established in 1961 as a department in the Ministry of
Public Works, after the consolidation of three Dutch-owned electricity cor-
panies. In 1972, PLN was constituted as an autonomous public agency under ':M
(para. 1.12). MME's and PLN's headquarters and regional organizational charts
are given in Annex 6.



- 10 -
3.03      PLN's major policies and programs - including its investment plans,
budgets and tariffs - are subject to review by a supervisory board, establish-
ed in 1981 and chaired by the DGEP, and ultimately to approval by GOI. PLN is
also bound by a number of GOI procedures affecting all public sector enter-
prises.
Growth and Constraints
3.04      Over the past years PLN has grown impressively from a department of
a Ministry, unable to meet even half the country's demand and leaving indus-
tries and commercial establishments to install their own captive power plants,
to become the largest public utility in the country. During the period
1971/72 through 1976/77, growth of PLN's sales averaged about 12% p.a., where-
as captive plants grew at a higher rate of 15% to 20% p.a. Since 1977/78, PLN
has connected new consumers at an average rate of about half a million every
year, and its sales increased annually by an average.rate of about 20% for the
period 1976/77 to 1982/83. Performance indicators such as the number of
consumers per employee and the energy sold per employee improved. Transmis-
sion and distribution losses were reduced and standards of reliability of
supply improved. Annex 7 gives some of the performance indicators for PLN for
the period 1977/78 to 1982/83 which illustrate this trend. The growth of
uneconomic captive plants in the country also declined rapidly during this
period (Annex 8).
3.05      Inevitably, such rates of growth have caused considerable strain on
PLN's management. Areas in which a need for strengthening has been recognized
as a condition of maintaining the rate of growth are summarized below:
(a) Management development: the need for a more comprehensive corporate
management system and planning process. Also identified is the need
to strengthen PLN's engineering and project management capabilities,
including project preparation, design, progress supervision, cost
control and procurement arrangements;
(b) Manpower development: the need for improved manpower planning and
enhanced training facilities, including managerial training; and
(c)  Accounting and budgeting:  the need to rebuild the accounting system
to provide accurate and timely information, and develop the
budgeting system into a useful tool of management control.
3.06      During the past few years, considerable attention has been given to
improvements in PLN's management and institution. Technical assistance is
either already underway or planned, in many cases with the support from the
Bank; these are discussed in the paragraphs below.



- 11 -
Management Development
3.07      The Bank has many technical assistance programs included in its
ongoing projects with PLN. These programs, as summarized below, are designed
to support PLN's effort to deal with its management problems which can be
grouped into four major areas, viz., planning, project management, management
information system and general management.
Planning
3.08      Through the years, weakness has been identified in the coordination
of PLN's overall planning activities. The planning process for its develop-
ment program has not been supported by complementary demand analysis and PLN's
own manpower and financial planning. To address this problem, PLN set up a
corporate planning unit in 1981 and a market survey unit in 1982 with Govern-
ment agreeing to provide necessary policy guidelines and data to PLN for
improving the quality of the survey results (para. 2.04). Further institu-
tional improvement in the market survey area is included under the proposed
project (para. 2.05). As agreed under the eleventh power project (Loan 2056-
IND), PLN prepares a rolling 10-year financial forecast and financing plan
based on its long-term investment program (para. 5.15). The manpower
development planning issue was addressed under the twelfth power project (Loan
2214-IND) (para. 3.18).
3.09      The corporate planning unit, which was established to improve the
coordination of planning activities among various departmental and regional
units, is not yet operating as it should, mainly because of a shortage of
trained staff to effectively take up the responsibility. PLN has prepared a
program for the training of its senior technical staff which was reviewed by
the Bank and found generally satisfactory. Details are being developed.
Project Management
3.10      Since PLN has undertaken a number of large thermal and hydro pro-
jects, delays have been occurring in their implementation. The weaknesses
identified in this area include: (a) undefined and fragmented responsibil-
ities; (b) inadequate monitoring of progress; (c) inadequate financial control
of expenditures and project costs; (d) lack of uniform design standards; and
(e) long delays in procurement and disbursement actions. Under the eighth
power project (Loan 1708-IND), the Bank financed a Project Management Advisory
Services (PMAS) assignment which specifically addresses all aspects of project
management. The project cost and progress reporting system recommended by the
PMAS is now being implemented. The directors of construction and planning of
PLN and a number of their managers completed in 1983 a program of
familiarization with current project planning and control techniques organized
by the consultants in the UK. PLN has recently set up a Central Project
Services Group in the Directorate of Construction to monitor the progress 
major projects and liaise with field organizations. A project liaison officer
is being designated for each of the major projects. Various other steps have
also been initiated.



- 12 -
3.11      Responding to the slowdown in the pace of disbursements on earlier
loans, during early 1982 a system of monitoring of disbursement performance of
Bank loans on a monthly basis was established to enable the Management to
identify the causes of slippages and to take timely remedial steps. The
system is not yet working satisfactorily. The preparation of the monthly
statements is not on time and has been unduly delayed recently due to the
transfer of responsibility for them from the Construction to the Finance
Directorate. These delays are expected to be a short-term phenomenon and
should improve once the new staff become familiar with the procedures invol-
ved. Other external factors causing disbursement delays involve complex and
lengthy procedures for the approval of contracts, issue of letters of credit
etc. These factors apply to other sectors as well, and the Bank has taken up
these matters with the Government.
3.12      Under the twelfth power project (Loan 2214-IND), PLN was expected to
prepare an action plan by January 1984, to improve the efficiency of procure-
ment administration, for which responsibilities are fragmented and expertise
in certain specialized areas is weak. During the appraisal of the proposed
project, the question of reorganization of PLN's departments for more effec-
tive project implementation capability was discussed. In view of the various
deficiencies discussed in para. 3.10, it was agreed with PLN that, in the
interest of integration of expertise and optimum use of scarce skilled man-
power, PLN should aim to unify project formulation, engineering, design,
procurement, and construction monitoring under an Engineering Services
Center. PLN has formulated plans for such a reorganization which are accept-
able to the Bank. An action plan for the implementation of these proposals
has also been agreed, according to which the Engineering Services Center will
be set up by March 31, 1985 and suitably staffed thereafter.
Management Information Systems
3.13      Currently, PLN is developing information systems in the following
areas, some of which are being developed with Bank financing: (i) operation;
(ii) project management (eighth power project); (iii) finance and accounting
(eleventh power project); and (iv) personnel and manpower development (twelfth
power project). These sub-systems will be integrated into a general manage-
ment information system for PLN. Also the new system will be made compatible
with the sector management information system which is now being implemented
by MME (para. 1.09). In all these works, local counterpart staff assignment
has been emphasized in order to ensure the transfer of know-how, and effective
maintenance of the system by local staff once the systems are installed for
operation.
General Management
3.14      PLN's present highly centralized system is characterized by a pre-
ference for "consensus" decision making with a practice of strictly hier-
archial communication and very limited horizontal coordination. The
consequences are a heavy and growing workload on senior managers and over-
dependence by regions and projects on decisions from headquarters. In 1981,
MME initiated a move to encourage PLN to introduce a management by objective
system based on greater delegation of responsibilities from senior to junior



- 13 -
staff, and from headquarters to regional offices. For this purpose, PLN
introduced a system of targets and objectives for monitoring regional perfor-
mance. The Bank has given, and will continue to give full support to these
initiatives. Under earlier projects, the Bank and PLN agreed to use perfor-
mance indicators to monitor PLN's overall performance; these indicators
included, among others, sales, system losses, consumers' connections and
financial targets. This mechanism, together with PLN's internal monitoring
schemes, should serve as a useful tool for improving and measuring its
performance.
Manpower Development
3.15      As of March 31, 1983, PLN had a staff of about 40,000 employees;
about 24,000 are employed on the permanent payroll. PLN has no difficulty in
recruiting staff at levels up to technical high school, but less than 3% of
the staff have full university degrees. There is an urgent need for manpower
development, particularly when GOI and PLN are seriously planning to limit
PLN's reliance on foreign consultants.
3.16      To address the manpower problem, PLN established a separate depart-
ment for education and training. This department, known as Pusdiklat, plays
an important supporting role and manages six training centers with a staff of
over 200, including about 50 trained instructors. During the period 1980/81
through 1982/83, a total of 6,500 employees were trained under various pro-
grams; about 4,750 received training from PLN's own training centers and the
remainder from programs arranged by suppliers, consultants and overseas
utility companies.
3.17      The ninth power project (Loan 1872-IND) provided for an advanced
training school for training in the operation of thermal power plants at
Suralaya, with a facsimile digital training simulator. Additionally, training
was also arranged overseas in the fields of system protection, design of ther-
mal stations and their special maintenance problems, and in extra-high voltage
(500 kV) practices. Under the tenth power project (Loan 1950-IND), on-the-job
training was arranged in the country with the help of consultants in selected
areas, e.g., civil works contract administration, power system planning and
operation, and power market surveys. These programs have been proceeding
well.
3.18      PLN's training program was reviewed in 1982 in the context of over-
all staffing requirements in the decade ahead. The twelfth power project
(Loan 2214-IND) includes a large training component ($25.0 million) to
reorganize and enlarge the entire manpower development, training and personnel
management functions for middle and lower level staff. It also provides for
starting five more training centers, improving job performance evaluation
systems and introducing inhouse management training. Expatriate assistance
involving about 30 man-years has already begun, with the assistance of Pacific
Engineers and Construction Company of Taiwan.

3.19      Lack of trained staff is also a major constraint in PLN's accounting
areas. PLN has made an effort to recruit qualified and experienced account-
ants to fill more senior posts. In early 1983, a senior accountant was trans-
ferred from the Ministry of Finance to PLN as Deputy Director, Accounting;
another accountant has recently been recruited. PLN is in the process of pre-
paring a crash program of training in accounting practices and procedures
under an Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan. They are also preparing a program
for overseas training for certain accounting/finance staff in areas of
financial projections and planning, tariff setting, etc., which will be
included in the program for the training of senior technical personnel
(para. 3.09).
Accounting and Budgeting
3.20      PLN's present accounting system follows generally accepted princi-
ples and normal utility practices (para. 5.01). But this system, which was
originally installed in the early 1970s, needs redesigning and restructuring
because it has become increasingly ineffective due to the increased complexity
and volume of accounting transactions. In addition to the Bank-assisted
general consultancy services described below (para. 3.22), PLN will carry out
interim measures and undertake several studies, supported by ADB financing, to
improve its property accounting and reporting system and electronic data
processing applications.
3.21      As a state company, PLN's budgets are subject to review by a super-
visory board and Government's approval (para. 3.03). PLN's internal proce-
dures for budget preparation and monitoring actual expenditures are not very
effective. Coordination among various departmental units and between regional
offices is also weak. PLN's management has begun reviewing the current pro-
cedures and identifying areas for improvement.
3.22      Under the eleventh power project (Loan 2056-IND), funds have been
provided for consultancy services to assist PLN in setting up a more appro-
priate accounting system, and to strengthen procedures for budgetary con-
trol. The assignment will also cover a financial management information
system utilizing computer facilities for accounting and financial reporting.
The consultants (Pamintori in association with Coopers & Lybrand, Australia)
started their work in early 1983 and are expected to complete the assignment
by the end of 1984.
Billing and Collections
3.23      Bills are prepared on a monthly basis.  Computer billing is utilized
at the computer center at the headquarters in Jakarta. Collection performance
is generally satisfactory. The receivable position of general consumer
accounts has been kept at about one and one-half months of the yearly bill-
ing. However, collections from some Government users (including Army users
and local governments) have not been promptly settled as required under the
previous Bank loans.
3.24      The Government is aware of the unsatisfactory payment performance by
Government users. In 1983, the MME issued instructions jointly with the



- 15 -
Ministries of Finance, Defense, and Home Affairs to expedite payments by
Government users to PLN. Outstanding Government accounts receivable were
reduced from over one year in 1981/82 to about five months of billing in
1982/83; this is still not considered satisfactory. In order to further
reduce the arrears, during the appraisal of this project BAPPENAS agreed that
adequate funds will be provided in the budget for Government departments and
entities and local governments to pay their bills to PLN; PLN was requested by
BAPPENAS to provide the estimated amounts. During negotiations, an agreement
was reached with the Government which would require that amounts owed to PLN
by all Government users in aggregate are less than two months of total
billings for such users. PLN would be required to keep collection data for
Government users adequately disaggregated so that the source of any overdue
payment problems could be identifed. An action plan to bring down the
outstanding accounts receivable to within two months billing was also agreed
with the Government and PLN during negotiations.
Audits
3.25      PLN's accounts are required by its charter to be audited by Govern-
ment auditors. The audits are carried out following generally accepted
auditing practices and standards. The audit reports are acceptable to the
Bank, but are subject to delays as a result of the problems affecting PLN's
accounting system. In 1983 special efforts were made to expedite the closing
of all regional accounts; PLN was able to complete the consolidated accounts
for audit, as prescribed by its charter, six months after the close of the
fiscal year 1982/83. The audited accounts with report were submitted to the
Bank in December 1983. PLN has also taken measures to train its local
accounting staff and begun to prepare plans to computerize large districts to
expedite accounts processing. PLN is expected to be able to complete its
accounts as required under the law. To be in line with the Government's
auditing requirements for all public corporations, it was, therefore, agreed
during the negotiations that the Bank's existing audit covenant will be
modified from six months to nine months after the close of the fiscal year for
submission of audited accounts with reports. PLN, however, will be required
to submit its unaudited accounts to the Bank for early review at the time it
is required to submit them for Government audit.
3.26      PLN has an effective internal audit group reporting to the President
Director which carries out various special investigations in addition to keep-
ing general accounting matters under review.
Insurance
3.27      PLN carries motor vehicle insurance, transit and marine insurance on
equipment and materials in transit. Fire and other hazards are self-
insured. In view of the geographical spread of PLN's assets, any single loss
would be relatively small by comparison with total assets and operations, and
this policy has been accepted by the Bank. However, some very large sized
projects are under implementation now which would result in a greater concen-
tration of assets in certain locations than in the past. Therefore GOI/PLN
propose to intitate a review of the risks and adequacy of the self insurance
procedures.

IV. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
4.01      The project supports one of the major elements of the GOI's energy
policy of diversification away from oil in the generation of electricity, by
supporting the construction of the coal-fired generating plant at Suralaya.
The Bank has been involved with the development of this major thermal genera-
tion project since its conceptual stages and has had an active involvement in
the optimization of the techn cal and organizational aspects. The Bank's
support for the project will ensure timely implementation of generation as
well as distribution facilities, which are urgently needed, in the current
environment of resource scarcity. The project also supports further improve-
ments and consolidation of PLN's skills in planning, construction and
management, in which the Bank can play a constructive role. Appropriate
instituticnal support is being orovided for this purpose. Of particular note
is the extension of the institutional strengthening effort in the areas of
financial performance and engineering. Financial performance measures and
objectives adopted in the context of the project (paras. 5.21 and 5.23) and
structural changes to be made in the organization of engineering and related
functions (para. 3.12) represent significant steps forward for the utility.
Project Description
4.02      The project comprises the following:
(a)  Construction of 2 x 400 MW coal-fired thermal unit nos. 3 and 4 at
Suralaya in West Java.
(b)  Extension of the distribution network in Jakarta, Bogor, Tangerang,
Bekasi (referred to as Jabotabek area), East Java and Central Java.
(c)  Consulting services for detailed engineering and construction super-
vision for the construction of transmission lines and substations in
Java and for engineering and design of hydro projects (paras 4.06
and 4.11).
Suralaya Steam Power Plant
4.03      The feasibility study for the Suralaya Steam Power Plant in West
Java was financed under the fourth power project (Loan 1127-IND) and completed
in 1977. The construction of the first two 400 MW units was financed under
the eigth and ninth power projects (Loans 1708-IND and 1872-IND). The first
unit is scheduled to be commissioned in October 1984 and the second unit in
June 1985. The twelfth power project (Loan 2214-IND) provided funds for conr
sulting engineering services for detailed engineering and construction
supervision for units 3 and 4 and also for auxiliary equipment for unit 3,
excluding the turbine generator and steam-generator islands. Units 3 and 4
will be coal-fired only, unlike units 1 and 2 which are coal and oil fired.



- 17 -
Coal Supply
4.04      Coal for the first two units will be provided from the Bukit Asam
Coal Mining and Transportation project now under implementation (Bank Loan
2079-IND) which will have a capacity of 3.0 million tons per annum. The coal
for units 3 and 4 is expected to be provided from indigenous sources. Explo-
ration in the Muara Tiga area, adjoining Bukit Asam, has already proven mine-
able reserves of over 100 million tons, which are in excess of the require-
ments of Suralaya units 3 and 4, over their life of 30 years. A feasibility
study for the mine development financed by the Bank Loan 2153-IND is in
progress. Also explorations are in progress in other parts of Sumatra and
Kalimantan (para. 1.03). The Government proposes to develop indigenous
production as shown in Table 4.1, which will be adequate to meet coal
requirements for power generation and other users.
Table 4.1: INDONESIAN COAL PRODUCTION
('000 tons)
Mine              1984     1985      1986     1987      1988      1989     1990

Bukit Asam          450      660    2,190    2,960    3,035    3,035    3,035
Others                -      575    1,400    2,800    5,000    7,250   10,750
Total            950    1,985    4,600    6,870    9,345   11,945   15,595
4.05      In the event of a delay in the development of indigenous coal pro-
duction, it would be possible to meet the coal requirements of Suralaya by
imported coal. Currently, a task force set up by the GOI is looking into this
possibility for the anticipated deficit in the 1984-85 period. During negoti-
ations, an understanding was reached with GOI, that it will submit to the Bank
satisfactory plans to supply adequate coal for the operation of Suralaya
units, either by indigenous production or imports, at least two years prior to
the commissioning of unit 3, i.e. by June 30, 1986, and thereafter GOI will
implement the agreed plan, in order to ensure adequate and timely coal
supplies to all the four units at Suralaya.
Transmission and Distribution
4.06      Early in 1981, using funds out of Loan 1365-IND, PLN commissioned
Beca Worley International (BWI) of New Zealand to review and report on the
adequacy of its transmission and distribution program till 1987 to match the
ongoing program of construction of new generating facilities in Java, North
Sumatra and South Sulawesi (referred to as JASUSS area). BWI's report submit-
ted in April 1982, identified additional requirements for transmission and
distribution projects. This has resulted in a number of projects addressing
distribution requirements such as Bank Loans 2056-IND and 2214-IND for



- 18 -
Jabotabek area and loss reduction; distribution in the cities of Semarang,
Yogyakarta, Solo, Malang, Surabaya and Medan plus North Sumatra Transmission
and Distribution projects financed by ADB; and the Bandung Distribution
project financed by Kuwait and Abu Dhabi Funds. In 1983, PLN's planning
department reviewed the ongoing program for the balance between generation,
transmission and distribution development in Java and formulated proposals for
transmission and substation requirements up to 1989. The proposed project
provides for the services of consulting engineers for detailed engineering and
construction supervision for assisting PLN in designing and implementing the
transmission development program.
Distribution
4.07      East and Central Java:  The BWI study (para. 4.06) identified the
requirements in Java for the extension of the 20 kV distribution system to
form a backbone network. PLN established distribution planning units in each
of its regions in late 1982, and entrusted them with the task of formulating
detailed proposals for the expansion of the distribution networks based on
survey of areas, demand potential and consumer connection targets. The
regional offices in East, Central and West Java have carried out such studies
in 1983 for the period 1984/85 to 1988/89. They have formulated proposals,
prepared cost estimates and subjected them to financial analysis for rank-
ing. The proposed project includes schemes in East and Central Java which
meet the financial viability criteria and can be implemented in the two year
period 1985-87. Requirements for West Java up to 1987 are fully covered by
the ongoing projects funded by other agencies.
4.08      Jabotabek Area:  The Bank has been involved in the reinforcement and
expansion of the distribution system in the city of Jakarta and the surround-
ing areas, referred to as Jabotabek region (para. 1.16). The first two opera-
tions covered only Jakarta city; the fifth and eleventh operations (Loans
1259-IND and 2056-IND) extended the scope to the Jabotabek region, covering an
area of about 5,700 sq kms and a population of over 10 million. This area
contributes about 40% to the total electricity sales of PLN.
4.09      In 1979/80, SOFRELEC of France, the engineer associated since 1970
with the rehabilitation and expansion program in Jabotabek area, carried out a
feasibility study of the requirements of the area during the period 1982-90.
PLN's planning department has updated these studies in 1983, to identify the
requirements beyond the scope of Loan 2056-IND, which will be completed by
mid-1985, up to 1988/89. The proposed project includes the estimated require-
ments for one year after mid-1985.
4.10      Combined Scope:  The scope of the distribution component of the
project involves the following construction activities:

4.  Service connections & meters        183,091         91,705        129,816
Annex 9 gives a breakdown of the program in terms of physical quantities
required in different areas.
Hydro Studies
4.11      A nationwide study of the hydro potential of the country
(para. 1.04) identified approximately 1,300 schemes amounting to a hydro
potential of 78,000 KW in power and 410,000 GWh in annual energy. Preliminary
screening led to 130 schemes considered suitable for further investigation.
Loan 1365-IND provided funds for a prefeasibility study of twenty-one schemes
and feasibility studies for five of these. Nippon Koei are presently working
on the feasibility studies; the work will be completed in 1984. The proposed
project provides funds for continuing this work i.e. engineering and detailed
design of feasible projects. Annex 10 gives the major features of the five
projects under study, three of which are in Sumatra, one in Java and one in
South Sulawesi.
Cost Estimate
4.12      Annex 11, Tables 1 and 2 give the detailed cost estimates for the
Suralaya units 3 and 4, and the Distribution component of the project respec-
tively. All costs are based on December 1983 prices; physical contingencies
are at about 10%. The price contingencies, calculated on the basis of the
following inflation factors, amount to 18% of the base cost plus phyical
contingencies:
Year         1984       1985      1986       1987       1988       1989   1990

4.16      PLN initially intended to finance the turbine generators for
Suralaya units 3 and 4 through suppliers' credit as well. However, the Bank
was asked to finance them when it became apparent that these could not be
accommodated within the export credit ceiling imposed by the Government for
PLN. As the Government's sectoral export credit allocations were imposed in
the interest of prudent debt management and were consistent with the overall
borrowing strategy endorsed by the Bank, it was agreed to finance the turbine
generators from the proposed loan.
4.17      At negotiations, an assurance was obtained from the Government to
provide necessary funds to PLN for financing the project. The proceeds of the
Bank loan will be onlent by GOI to PLN under a subsidiary loan agreement
satisfactory to the Bank. The signing of this subsidiary agreement would be a
condition of the Bank's loan effectiveness. The onlending rate would be equal
to the Bank's standard variable interest rate plus no less than a quarter
percent for administration charges. GOI will bear the foreign exchange risk
in line with its policy applicable to all public corporations in Indonesia.
Engineering and Construction
4.18      The Suralaya extension will be carried out by PLN, -Ath the
assistance of MONENCO Associates of Canada/U.K., who are also the engineers
for the ongoing work on the first two 400 KW generating sets. MONENCO was
appointed in April 1982 for detailed engineering and supervision of construc-
tion of units 3 and 4, the services being financed under the twelfth power
project (Loan 2214-IND). They are associated with a local consulting firm of
PT Central Development Enterprise. The total cost of engineering services is
UK B12.7 million and Rp 4.0 billion. The contract includes a provision for
the transfer of knowhow and training of PLN's personnel in Indonesia as well
as overseas.



- 22 -
4.19      The engineering and construction of the distribution component of
the project will be carried out by PLN's own distribution staff in the wilayas
(PLN's regions).  The staff in Jabotabek area is already implementing the on-
going program of the expansion of distribution network (Loan 2056-IND) and is
sufficiently experienced and adequate for the proposed program. Adequate
staff is also avail-able in the East and Central Java Distribution Divisions to
undertake the proposed program. All procurement will be centrally carried out
by PLN's staff at the head office.
Procurement
4.20      Except for concrete poles required for distribution which will be
procured by local competetive bidding, all other equipment and services
financed under the proposed Bank loan shall be procured by international
competetive bidding (ICB), in accordance with the Bank's procurement
guidelines. Qualifying domestic manufacturers would be eligible for a
preference in bid evaluation of 15% or the import duty, whichever is lower.
The Bank financed items will include (a) turbine generators and ancillary
equipment for Suralaya units 3 and 4; (b) structural steel work and cladding,
ash and coal handling plant, electrical equipment, transformers and
miscellaneous equipment for Suralaya unit 4; (c) equipment for distribution;
and (d) consulting services. Consultants will be engaged in accordance with
the Bank guidelines.
4.21      Procurement arrangements are summarized in the Table 4.3.
4.22      All bidding packages for goods financed by the Bank and estimated to
cost over US$1,000,000 equivalent would be subject to the Bank's prior review
of procurement documents, which covers all the foreseen contracts.
Implementation Schedule
4.23      Annex 12 gives the implementation schedule for Suralaya units 3 and
4 and Annex 13 shows it for the distribution component of the project. The
commissioning dates for Suralaya units 3 and 4 are June 1988 and March 1989
respectively. The construction of the distribution facilities included in the
project is scheduled to be completed by the middle of 1987.  The implementa-
tion schedule for the Suralaya units is based on the award decision on the
contract for steam generators by June 30, 1984; proposals for them have
already been received and are under evaluation. Since this is the critical
step for the timely implementation of the project, signing of this contract
will be the condition of the effectiveness of the proposed loan.
Disbursement
4.24      The Bank loan would be disbursed against:  (a) 100% of the foreign

Ecology
4.27      Design of the Suralaya steam power plant has taken into account the
requirement that the environmental impact of the operation of the plant at its
fully developed capacity of 3,100 NW should not exceed accepted norms.  In
particular, the following steps have been taken.
4.28      Air Quality.  Electrostatic precipitators with a particulate removal
efficiency of 99.5% are provided to prevent ash and dust particles from
polluting the environment. A stack height of 200 meters has been selected to
ensure that the ground level concentration of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen
oxides will not exceed the limits laid down by the US Environmental Protection
Agency regulations.
4.29      Water Temperature Rise.  The layout and design of the circulating
water system will ensure that the residual impact upon the ocean and its life
forms is minimal. Dispersal of the thermal plume from the sea outfall has
been modeled and found to be within acceptable limits.
4.30      Liquid Chemical Effluent.  Plant liquid chemical effluents will be
held in a neutralization basin and treated prior to discharge into the circu-
lating water discharge channel where they will be rapidly diluted before
entering the Sunda Strait.
4.31      Distribution projects will be designed and carried out in accordance
with current technological practices and will cause minimum disturbance to the
environment. No safety hazards are foreseen.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Results
5.01      When PLN was established, there was no accounting system and proce-
dures in operation, and accounts were not properly recorded. Under the Bank's
first lending operation (Credit 165-IND, 1969), consultancy services were
financed t.o assist PLN in setting up an accounting system and preparing a
balance sheet and operating budget (para. 3.20).
5.02      The growth in PLN's operation has been impressive, but its financial
performance has been uneven. PLN's detailed financial statements for the
period 1977/78 through 1983/84 are given in Annex 15. Highlights of its
operation are summarized in Table 5.1.
5.03      After the May 1980 tariff adjustment, PLN's operating income
improved to Rp 31 billion in 1980/81 from an operating loss of Rp 21 billion
in 1979/80. Since then, PLN's operating income has been declining steadily to
Rp 2 billion in 1981182 and to a loss of Rp 11 billion in 1982/83. Over the
period 1980/81 to 1982/83, operating revenues increased by an average of 38%
p.a., while operating expenses rose by about 48% p.a. The latter increase was

Note:  1. Operating revenues do not include other net income, e.g. consumers'
contribution.
2. Assets were revalued in 1975/76 and 1979/80.
3. Self-financing ratio computed on a three-year average (current plus 2 previous).
mainly attributable to the increase in the fuel prices during this period
(para. 5.09).
5.04      Effective March 1984, the Government approved an electricity tariff
increase of about 32%. As in the past three years, this latest tariff
increase was intended only to absorb the fuel price impact on PLN's operating
costs (para. 5.10), and it was again lagged behind the January 1984 fuel price
increase by nearly two months leaving PLN to absorb about US$35 million in
increased fuel costs in January/February 1984.
5.05      As a result  PLN is expected to incur an operating loss of about
Rp 20 billion in 1983184,-2 altlhough PLN is able to achieve a self-financing
ratio (SFR) of about 15% 4/ (para. 5.23).  The performance would have been
better if the timing of the tariff increase had been synchronized with the
increase in fuel costs.
3/   Based on April 1983 estimates.
4/   PLN has been able to meet the required interim targets of SFR in the past
mainly because of: (a) high percentage of consumers' contribution and
depreciation in PLN's internal sources; and (b) lower level of realized
capital expenditure than originally projected.

Present Position
5.06      PLN's estimated balance sheet as of March 31, 1984 is summarized in
Table 5.2 and is compared with the audited 1982/83 position.
5.07      Although PLN's operating results have been uneven in the past few
years, its financial position at the end of 1983/84 indicates a comfortable
margin in its debt/equity ratio. As required of all public corporations by
the Government, PLN's assets have been revalued twice at four-year intervals;
first in 1975/76 and then in 1979/80 (para. 5.27).
5.08      Of the total assets in 1983/84, 68Z is estimated to come from equity
financing, mainly from Government capital contributions; the remainder is from
long-term debt (24%) and consumers' contribution (8%).
Fuel Prices
5.09      Fuel cost accounts for nearly 60% of PLN's total operating
expenses. Increases in fuel price (para. 1.08) have imposed upward pressure
on PLN's costs. From 1978/79 to 1983/84, the average fuel price to PLN
increased by almost nine times - from Rp 23/liter in 1976/77 to nearly
Rp 200/liter in 1983/84, whereas PLN's average tariff increased by only about
three times over the same period, from Rp 27/kWh to Rp 75/kWh.
5.10      As a result of the latest fuel price increases in January 1984,
PLN's fuel cost in 1984/85 is expected to rise by an average of about 55%. To
compensate for this increase in the fuel expense, the Government approved an
increase in PLN's tariff by about 32Z over its 1983/84 level (para. 5.04).
Tariff Issues
5.11      PLN's present tariff schedule comprises 17 consumer categories.  For
all except the smallest domestic class, two-part charges are applied, and for
industrial and large commercial consumers time-of-day pricing is in effect.
Provision can be made for surcharges to cover cost increases. Variation of
surcharges requires the Minister's approval; alteration of the basic rate,
however, requires Presidential approval. The present tariff structure and the
history of past tariff increases are given in Annex 18.
5.12      The present basic rate schedule was introduced by PLN in May 1980 to
structure its electricity tariffs according to the Long Run 2Iarginal Cost
(LRMC) pricing principles, as agreed with the Bank under the seventh power
project (Loan 1513-IND). However, since 1980, all tariff increases have been
effected entirely through §7anges in the energy charges.  The failure to
adjust the demand charges -  has distorted the tariff structure.
5/   "Energy charge" is the charge per kWh based on metered consumption of
electricity. "Demand charge" is the fixed component of a customer's bill
which is designed to recover the "capacity costs" (e.g. depreciation,
finance charges) of the capacity the utility must keep to meet peak
demands.

5.13      PLN has completed, as agreed under the thirteenth power project
(Loan 2300-IND), a study of its cost and tariff structure. Based on the
result of this study, and after consultation with GOI and the Bank, PLN is
expected to design its tariff structure to better reflect LRMC of electricity
supply (including peak hour characteristics). During negotiations, agreements
were reached for PLN to review its LRMC periodically and to carry out an
annual review of its tariff level based on its financial requirements and
economic efficiency pricing. PLN will review the results of these studies
with GOI and the Bank before the end of each calendar year.

Financing Policy
5.14      With negligible net income, PLN's major sources of internal funds
have been depreciation and consumers' contribution. The remainder of PLN's
investment program, which is not financed from internal funds, has been provi-
ded exclusively by GOI. Although PLN is authorized to borrow from local and
foreign lenders and to issue its own obligations, the Government in practice
secures all foreign borrowings on behalf of PLN as a matter of policy for all
public corporations. PLN's local currency expenditures are customarily reim-
bursed in the form of equity contribution through the project budgeting (DIP)
system. The foreign exchange expenditures are partly funded through equity
and partly through the on-lending of foreign loans and credits secured by the
Government; this latter financing has become increasingly important as
illustrated in the following table.
Table 5.3: FINANCING SOURCES FOR 1974/75-1978/79
AND 1979/80-1983/84

5.15      Budgetary constraints facing GOI in recent years indicate that PLN
would not be able to count on receiving the same level of Government equity as
in the past. The Bank has been recommending that PLN's long-term objective
should be to secure a significantly higher degree of leverage in its financing
plan by increasing its external borrowings. The study of PLN's financing
policy by the Government's three banking advisors (Lazard Freres, S. G.
Warburg and Kuhn Loeb Lehman Bros.) also shares the view that future Govern-
ment equity funding should be minimized when loan financing could be used
instead. The possibility of a limited amount of funding through bond issues
also needs to be considered. As agreed under earlier Bank loans, PLN has
begun to prepare a rolling ten-year financial forecast based on its proposed
development program and a financing plan covering the first five-year period
as part of its corporate planning procedures. In addition, the Government has
agreed to review annually with PLN and the Bank PLN's financial forecasts and
financing plan. These covenants will be continued under the proposed loan.
To improve PLN's financial planning capability, training of financial staff
will also be included in the training program for senior technical staff
(para. 3.09).

5.16      On the basis of the investment program given in Annex 1, the financ-
ing plan for the period 1984/85 through 1988/89 is summarized below:
Table 5.4: FINANCING PLAN 1984/85 - 1988/89
1984/85 - 1988/89
Billion Rp     Z
Capital expenditures                      11,286.8    100.0
Financed by:
Net internal sources                     2,705.2      24.0
Borrowings                               6,081.6      53.9
Equity                                   2,500.0      22.1
Total                               11,286.8    100.0
5.17      The financing plan assumes that the equity funding from GOI during
1984/85 through 1988/89 could be expected to average about Rp 500 billion p.a.
and that annual borrowings will increase from about Rp 1,000 billion p.a.
during 1984/85 through 1986/87, to about Rp 1,500 billion p.a. during 1987/88
to 1988/89. The debt/equity ratio (excluding revaluation surplus) will
increase from about 35/65 in 1984/85 to a level of 46/64 by 1988/89, and the
annual debt service coverage ratio will remain at above 2.5 times throughout
the period. This projected performance is satisfactory. Under earlier loans,
the Government agreed to provide adequate funds to help finance PLN's capital
expenditures (para. 1.16), and to facilitate PLN's access to all possible
sources of required finance based on its financing plan (para. 5.15). These
covenants will be continued.
Performance Monitoring
5.18      Under earlier Bank loans, various measures have been adopted to
monitor PLN's financial performance. The choice of monitoring measures varied
as PLN's financial circumstances changed. During the financial recovery
period, 1972/73 through 1976/77, a cost recovery covenant was used and a 100%
revenue/cost ratio for 1978/79 with interim targets was set to ensure that
PLN's operation would cover its full operating expenses. PLN achieved full
cost recovery in 1976/77, three years ahead of the target year.
5.19      In 1976, PLN adopted cash generation targets using a three year
moving average of self-financing ratio as a measure of financial perfor-
mance. The quantification of the targets has been revised from time to
time. The existing covenant (under the twelfth power project, Loan 2214-IND)
provides for a target rate of 20% to be achieved in 1985/86 with interim tar-
gets set at 10% per year. These rates are subject to changes, in the event of



- 30 -
significant variation of PLN's capital expenditures and fuel costs. The
necessity to build in adjustments to modify the self-financing targets indi-
cates that this type of measure with the covenanted levels is less appropriate
fzom the viewpoint of financial viability under PLN's circumstances now than
six years ago.
5.20      Under the twelfth and the thirteenth power projects, the Bank raised
the issue of adopting a ROR covenant as one of the measures to monitor PLN's
financial performance. The advantages of adopting a ROR in PLN's case
include:
(a)  ROR is not affected by non-operating revenues, e.g., consumers'
contribution, and is therefore more related to consumption-based
tariffs;
(b)  the value of assets in use can usually be established with
reasonable certainty;
(c)  ROR is neutral as to the disposal of net cash flow; and
(d)  the lumpiness of PLN's investment program and the uncertainty in
estimating its capital expenditure will have little effect on the
ROR calculation.
5.21      While the Government and PLN agreed in principle to the advantages
of adopting the ROR, it was agreed to postpone the decision until the study of
PLN's finances by the Advisory Group (the Three Houses) was completed
(para. 5.15). This study is now completed, with a similar recommendation to
use ROR as the monitoring criterion. During negotiations, agreements with GOI
and PLN were reached to replace the existing SFR covenant by a ROR covenant
under the proposed loan. The ROR will be calculated on a revalued asset base
(para. 5.28). The SFR will be included as one of the performance indicators
and will be monitored regularly to ensure PLN's sound self-financing
capability (para. 5.24).
Future Performance
5.22      PLN's forecast financial performance for the period 1984/85 through
1989/90 is summarized in Table 5.5. Detailed projections are given in Annex
15, with notes and assumptions given in Annex 16.
5.23      In January 1984, the Government decided not only to remove the fuel
subsidies, but increase the prices of diesel and residual fuel oil even beyond
the international prices for resource mobilization. To compensate for the
increase in PLN's fuel expenses, the Government approved a tariff increase of
32X effective March 1, 1984 (para. 5.04). With this tariff increase, PLN is
expected to achieve an SFR of 15Z in 1983/84 and 13% in 1984/85 but incur
operating losses in both years. During negotiations, GOI and PLN agreed to
(i) take all necessary measures to ensure PLN's achievement of the minimum
financial objectives of a 6% ROR in 1985/86, and an 8% ROR in 1986/87 and
thereafter (para. 5.21); and (ii) by December 31 of each year, review the
adequacy of PLN's tariffs to meet these objectives (para. 5.13). The

financial performance expected of PLN in 1984/85 is considered acceptable
recognizing the facts that: (i) the removal of6 ubsidy in fuel prices is in
the larger interest of the sector (para. 1.08);-  (ii) a larger quantum of
electricity tariff adjustment immediately following the fuel price increase in
1984 was considered not feasible; and (iii) both GOI and PLN have now accepted
the ROR as the financial performance criterion and have made strong commit-
ments to achieve the agreed objectives.
5.24      The agreed ROR targets will result in improving PLN's self-financing
ratio from 13% in 1984/85 to 18% in 1985/86, 25% in 1986/87, and to 30% in
1987/88, which are considered satisfactory. The SFR will be regularly moni-
tored to ensure that PLN's self-financing capability will be maintained at
satisfactory levels. It is also proposed to review the ROR and SFR targets
for years beyond 1986/87, in light of the findings of the study of the long-
run marginal cost of supply now in progress and a detailed review of PLN's
investment program planned to be carried out in 1984/85 (paras.1.15 and 2.08).
5.25      In addition to fuel price and tariff adjustment, two other factors,
namely, energy sales and investment program, also significantly influence
PLN's financial operation and projected performance. With the uncertain
economic condition and the financing constraints now facing the country, it is
6/   The savings for GOI in terms of reductions in budgetary subsidy due to
the January 1984 fuel price increase are estimated at about US$1.6
billion in 1984/85.

necessary to examine, from a conservative point of view, the outcome of
possible changes in these factors and their implications on PLN's finances in
the next two years. Given the recent fuel price increase and the tariff
adjustment in 1984, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out for the
following cases:
Case 1:  Base case (para. 5.22).
Case 2:  Slower energy sales growth in 1984/85 and 1985/86 than the
base case.
Case 3:  Lower capital expenditures in 1984/85 and 1985/86 than the
base case.
Case 4:  Combination of Cases 2 and 3.
The aim is to compare these three cases with the Base Case with respect to the
following indicators:  (1) ROR; (2) SFR; and (3) external borrowings, assuming
an equity contribution of Rp 500 billion p.a. in 1984/85 and 1985/86.  The
results are given in Annex 19 and summarized below:

5.26       The Government currently assumes the exchange risk on the foreign
debt borrowed to finance all public corporations and this policy is assumed to
continue throughout the forecast period. The existing covenant binding PLN to
a minimum 1.5 times coverage of future debt service each year will continue
under the proposed loan to ensure PLN's prudent debt management.
Asset Revai! atton
5.27      PLN's assets have been revalued periodically.  The last detailed
revaluation was done in 1979/80 as required of all public corporations under
instructions of the Ministry of Finance. Net fixed assets were revalued
using the Gross Domestic Investment Deflators as published by the Bureau of
Statistics. The revaluation was recorded in the books and has been accepted
by the Bank. Fixed assets acquired after March 31, 1979 are appraised at
cost. On the basis of its 1979/80 revaluation results, PLN carried out a
simple yearly revaluation, starting from 1980/81, to arrive at revalued net
fixed assets in 1984/85.



- 33 -
5.28      However, it is necessary to carry out another detailed revaluation
following similar lines as the last revaluation in 1979/80 and also taking
into account the effect of currency devaluation. During negotiations,
agreements were reached with PLN: (i) to prepare a report on the methodology
of such a detailed revaluation, in consultation with the Government and the
Bank, by December 31, 1984; and (ii) to carry out annual revaluation of its
operating assets, accumulated depreciation, work in progress, and consumers'
contribution for the purpose of ROR calculation, for 1985/86 and thereafter.
The revaluation will be done on a memorandum account basis and need not be
incorporated in PLN's books.
Corporate Taxes
5.29      In accordance with the prevailing tax legislation, PLN is subject to
corporate income tax. However, PLN has been exempted from income tax payments
since 1980/81 for a period of five years. The exemption is an investment
incentive and is also being applied to some other revenue earning public cor-
porations in Indonesia. This status will be reviewed by GOI in 1984/85.
PLN's financial projections do not assume income tax payment. In calculating
the rate of return, however, any income tax payments will be taken into
account.
VI. JUSTIFICATION
Demand Growth and Need for the Project
6.01      The forecasts for electricity sales of PLN in Java are given in
Annex 3. The forecasts of peak demand, energy generation and installed
capacity requirements are given in Annex 20. As discussed in para. 2.06, it
is believed that a high rate of growth can be sustained at least through this
decade. The experience of the last two years in which, even under severe
recessionary economic conditions, a relatively high rate of growth in the
electricity sales was maintained, supports the above view. Also the demand
has not proved to be very sensitive to the price increases; tariff increased
nearly threefold from 1979 to 1983. Therefore the demand growth is expected
to continue to follow the trend indicated in the forecast-. If PLN's facili-
ties are not expanded to meet the demand, a revival in the growth of unecono-
mic private generation would occur (para. 3.04).
6.02      Based on the projects currently under implementation, the available
capacity would not be able to meet the demand from 1988/8-. onwards
(Annex 20). The deficit will increase to about 500 MW and 4,700 GWh, in
1989/90. Suralaya units 3 and 4 (800 MW, 4,800 GWh) woulc meet this need,
with their commissioning schedule of June 1988 and March 1989 respectively.
Least Cost Solution
6.03      The Java System Development Study for the period up to 1995 carried
out by PCR with Bank assistance (Credit 399-IND) established a least cost
sequence of expansion of generating capacity. PLN now has in-house capability



- 34 -
to periodically update the development plans. These studies show that the
addition of two 400 MW units to the coal fired Suralaya steam power plant
located in West Java is the least cost next step in the development program.
This conclusion is valid for the prevailing coal prices ($55-60 per ton of
Australian coal delivered to Suralaya or equivalent price of South Sumatra
Coal) for discount rates up to 20%. A 500kV extra high voltage transmission
network from Suralaya to Jakarta, Bandung and Ungarang (Central Java) is now
under construction (Loan 1872-IND) and its extension to Krian near Surabaya in
East Java is being taken up by the help of a German Credit (KfW). The output
of Suralaya power plant will be, therefore, utilized fully to serve the demand
in Java.
Distribution
6.04      PLN needs to expand its transmission and distribution facilities
rapidly to satisfy the large demands reflected in long waiting lists and to
reach the supply to large unelectrified areas. However, it is necessary to
keep a balance between generation, transmission and distribution facilities.
The generating capacity in Java will increase from about 2,700 MW in 1983/84
to about 4,900 MW in 1987/88, needing the following investments in transmis-
sion and distribution, which are included in PLN's investment program
(Annex 1).

6.05      The proposed project includes some of the distribution requirements
of East and Central Java in the period 1985-87 and of Jabotabek area for one
year period in 1986 as explained in paras. 4.06 to 4.09.
Economic Rate of Return
6. 06     The economic rate of return (IERR) of the investment program at the
prevailing tariff is about 12%, which indicates that the prevailing tariff is
close to the long run average incremental cost of supply. Additionally, the
IERR for Suralaya and the distribution components are worked out on a
segregated basis as discussed below.
6.07      Suralaya.  The economic rate of return for Suralaya units is worked
out by taking the capital, operation and maintenance costs for the project as
well as the investment required in transmission and distribution network for
transmitting its output to the consumers. The revenue to PLN at the prevail-
ing average tariff of US¢9.8 per kWh is taken as the benefit. On this basis
the IERR works out to 28% (Annex 21, Table 1). The IERR will drop to 26% if
the project costs escalate by 10%. The IERR is high because: (a) the project
is one of the low cost elements of the investment program; and (b) some of the



- 35 -
infrastructure costs have already been incurred at the time of construction of
units 1 and 2.
6.08      Jabotabek.  The economic rate of returr for the Jabotabek
distribution projects is worked out by taking the revenue to PLN as a measure
of the benefits, for the estimated incremental sales that would result from
this investment. The levelised costs for supply from the grid, both for capa-
city and energy, were estimated from the investment program and included in
the costs. On this basis, the IERR for the Jabotabek project works out to 20%
(Annex 21, Table 2). The IERR will drop to 17% if the project costs increase
by 10%. The benefits are understated in these calculations because the
consumer surplus is ignored.
6. 09     East and Central Java.  The rate of return on each distribution
expansion subproject in East and Central Java was worked out using a methodo-
logy similar to that used for the Jabotabek project. The subprojects included
in the project will have a rate of return above 10%.
Risks
6. 10     Suralaya project is the continuation of the ongoing project financed
by the eighth and ninth power loans; the experience with these projects has
confirmed that there are no technical risks associated with the project.
There is a risk of delay in the project for several reasons, viz. delay in
finalizing the critical stream generator contract, constraints on local funds
or inefficiency in implementation. The first two are reduced by suitable
understandings with PLN and GOI (paras. 4.17 and 4.23). Regarding the last,
PLN has gained considerable experience in the management of such a project in
the last few years and now has a competant project management team backed by
consultants who are in place.
6.11      There is no unusual risk associated with the proposed distribution
component of the project.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      Specific major agreements reached during negotiations for the
proposed loan are:
(a) From PLN that it will:
(i)    centralize and strengthen its project formulation, engineering,
design, procurement and construction monitoring activities by
establishing an Engineering Services Center as per an agreed
action plan (para. 3.12);
(ii)    complete and submit its unaudited accounts to the Bank within
six months of the end of fiscal years; and submit the audited
accounts and reports within nine months of the end of fiscal
years (para. 3.25);



- 36 -
(iii)    review its LRMC periodically and carry out an annual study of
its tariff level and review the results with the Bank and GOI,
by December 31 of each year (para. 5.13);
(iv)    take all required measures to achieve a rate of return on
revalued assets of not less than 6% in 1985/86 and 8% in
1986/87 and thereafter (para. 5.23).
(v)    maintain an annual debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.5
tines (para. 5.26); and
(vi)    prepare a report on the methodology of asset revaluation, in
consultation with GOI and the Bank, by December 31, 1984, and
carry out, for 1985/86 and thereafter, annual revaluation of
its net fixed assets, for the purpose of calculating the rate
of return (para. 5.28).
(b) From GOI that it will:
1)    furnish to the Bank by December 31, 1984, draft procedures to
ensure coordination of the relevent departments and agencies in
providing policy guidance to PLN's power market survey group
and reviewing and approving forecasts prepared '-y such group
and, thereafter, carry out such procedures in a timely manner
(para. 2.05);
(ii)    ensure that the amounts owed to PLN by all Government users,
are less than two months of billing, for their electricity
consumption (para. 3.24);
(iii)    prepare and submit to the Bank a satisfactory plan to supply
adequate coal for the operation of Suralaya units 1,2,3 and 4,
either by indigenous production or imports by June 30, 1986 and
thereafter implement the plan to ensure adequate coal supplies
to Suralaya (para. 4.05); and
(iv)    provide timely and necessary funds through budgetary allocation
for the financing of the proposed project (para. 4.17).
7.02      Cond-tions of effectiveness for the proposed loan would i-e (i) the
execution by GOI and PLN of a subsidiary loan agreement on terms and condi-
tions satisfactory to the Bank (para. 4.17); and (ii) signing of the contract
for steam generators for Suralaya units 3 and 4 (para. 4.23).
7.03      With the above agreements, the proposed project is suitable for a
loan of $210 million (including capitalized front-end fee) for a period of 20
years including a 5-year grace, at the standard variable interest rate, to the
Republic of Indonesia.

Notes and Assumptions for the Financial Forecasts
1.        Inflation has been taken into account at the following rates (X):
1990
and
1984    1985      1986    1987      1988   1989   after
Offshore costs             3.5      8.0      9.0      9.0      9.0    7.5   6.0
Local costs
(excluding fuel)        12.0    10.0      10.0    10.0       9.0    7.5   6.0
2.        Revenues assume a tariff increase of about 16% at the beginning of
1985/86.  Thereafter, the tariff is assumed to be adjusted to absorb the
impact of cost increases to achieve a rate of return of not less than 8% from
1986/87 onwards.
3.        Fuel/Bulk Power is derived directly from PLN's planting schedule.
The fuel cost for 1983/84 is estimated on the basis of PLN's Accounting
Progress Report (Third quarter, 1983/84), dated February 13, 1984, and the
fuel costs for 1984/85 and beyond are based on PLN's Financial Projection
Report, dated December 1983; all costs have been adjusted to reflect the
January 1984 fuel prices. The fuel prices to PLN are escalated by 3.5% in
1985/86, 5% in 1986/87 and 10% in 1987/88 and thereafter, on the assumption
that the domestic fuel prices will move in line with the projected inter-
national prices through 1989/90.
4.        Operating Expenses have been forecast taking into account the
facilities expected to be in use each year, and subject to local cost infla-
tion.
5.        Depreciation is based on the application of PLN's normal rates to
assets revalued annually.
6.        Financing.  Average terms of borrowings are assumed to be 19 years
repayment period with 4 year grace, and at an average interest rate of 8% p.a.

ANNEX 16
Page 2
7.        Capital Expenditures are based on PLN's investment program (Annex 1)
and exclude costs of geothermal steam field development which are assumed to
be incurred by another agency.
8.        Net Fixed Assets,work in progress and consumers' contribution are
revalued annually according to weighted annual escalation rates (foreign and
local). The rate base is the average revalued net fixed assets and does not
include work in progress and consumers' contribution.
9.        Customer accounts receivable are assumed at 60 days of energy
revenues.

Financial Sensitivity Analysis
1.        A sensitivity analysis has been performed to show the effect of
changes in PLN's (a) energy sales; (b) capital expenditures; and (c) tariff
level adjustments. The following paragraphs summarize the assumptions used in
the five cases under study and the results are tabulated in para. 6.
2.        Case 1:  Base Case
(a) Tariff increases in 1984/85 and 1985/86 are 32% and 16%,
respectively. Average tariff from 1986/87 onwards is maintained in
real terms and at levels enabling PLN to achieve a rate of return on
revalued assets of not less than 8% in 1986/87 and thereafter;
(b) the investment program for the projection period 1984/85 through
1989/90 is as given in Annex 1;
(c) the projected energy sales from 1984/85 to 1989/90 are based on the
forecast prepared by PLN's Power Market Survey Group, as given in
Annex 3;
(d) Government equity contributions are assumed at Rp 500 billion p.a.
from 1984/85 onwards; and
(e) revaluation adjustments to assets, depreciation and consumers con-
tribution are based on the December 1983 estimates by PLN's Finance
Department.
3.        Case 2
(a) the projected growth rates of energy sales in 1984/85 and 1985/86
are lower than those in the Base Case, i.e. 14% and 16% in Case 2 as
compared to 19% and 20% in the Base Case. From 1985/86 on, energy
sales will grow to reach the same level as the Base Case in 1989/90.
Fuel consumption has been adjusted to reflect these changes, assum-
ing a hydro:thermal ratio of 20:80; and
(b) other assumptions remain the same as in the Base Case.
4.        Case 3
(a) capital expenditures in 1984/85 and 1985/86 are assumed to be lower
by 25% p.a. than in the Base Case. The reduced amount is allocated
over the following 3 years (1986/87-1988/89) in proportion of
30:30:40; and

(b) other assumptions remain the same as In the Base Case.
5.        Case 4
(a)  combination of Cases 2 and 3.
6.        The results of the 4 cases are su2-arized below for 1984/85 and
1985/86:
