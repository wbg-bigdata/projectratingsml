 A.2. Project Objectives

 The project will develop an effective policy infrastructure to implement, manage and evaluate
 employment, education and social cohesion reforms in the MoLSAF and in the MoE.

 If successful, the project will develop institutional capacity for evidence-based policy making in the two
 participating Ministries.

 The Government of Slovakia intends to consolidate the reforms undertaken to date, and to couple them
 with forward-looking and mutually consistent employment and social cohesion policies in order to achieve
 a lasting decline in poverty and social exclusion. These reforms will be a necessary condition of
 Slovakia's continued growth.

 The Human Capital Technical Assistance (HCTA) project will contribute to these objectives by
 developing the human resources involved in policy-making; strengthening the management systems and
 processes governing policy preparation and ensuring the capacity for evidence based policy monitoring.

 The proposed project is fully consistent with the Country Partnership Strategy1 goals of supporting poverty
 alleviation through economic development, strengthening labor market reforms and introducing education
 reforms. It directly relates to two of the three main development challenges for Slovakia as discussed in
 the CPS: (i) to make Slovakia fully competitive in European and World Markets through the
 implementation of the structural reforms to improve labor and capital mobility; and (ii) to reduce poverty
 and unemployment and to address the marginalization of Roma.


 A.3. Project Description



1         Country Partnership Strategy, May 6, 2004.

The project will have three components:

Component 1: Creation Of A Policy Capacity Framework (Euro 960,000)

The objective of this component is create a framework within which policy making and the design and
implementation of components of reform in the two Ministries and associated institutions can be
coordinated. The component will provide technical assistance to: (i) assess the current institutional
capacity for policy making and monitoring in the two participating Ministries; (ii) develop a consistent and
sustainable strategy to increase technical capacity for implementation and monitoring of the reforms.
Additionally, the component will provide support for: (iii) the creation of project coordination mechanisms
and the necessary project implementation structure; and (iv) strategies to mainstream and ensure the
sustainability of reforms.

Component 2: Investment In Human Resources (Euro 3,400,000)

The objective of this component is to achieve a significant improvement in the quality of human resources
available for policy making and implementation in the two participating Ministries and associated
institutions, through the training and development of existing staff in policy and reform impact analysis
and through targeted recruitment strategies. The component will provide assistance to: (i) improve the
quality of the Human Resource Management systems in both MoLSAF and MoE; (ii) identify training
needs and opportunities (including internships, scholarships and research grants); (iii) enhance policy
capacity through the provision of training and exposure to other policy environments; and (iv) create
instruments to attract new researchers and policy analysts to enter the field through scholarship and
research grants.

Component 3: Building And Upgrading Institutional Capacity (Euro 620,000)

The objective of this component is to create and implement an integrated policy management system to
structure and guide the various steps in the policy cycle in both the participating Ministries and in the
network of associated institutions. The component will: (i) develop effective mechanisms to improve
evidence-based policy making, including the development of important national social and educational
action plans and reports; (ii) improve the quality and quantity of internationally comparable data available
to policy makers in both MoLSAF and MoE; and (iii) will develop social policy monitoring and evaluation
indicators in the field of employment, education and social cohesion.
