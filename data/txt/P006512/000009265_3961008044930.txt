MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
COMPANHIA VALE DO RIO DOCE (BRAZIL)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.   I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed US
dollar single currency loan to Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), with the Guarantee of the
Federative Republic of Brazil, for US$50 million equivalent to help finance an Environmental
Conservation and Rehabilitation Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard LIBOR-based
interest rate for US dollar single currency loans, for a maturity of 15 years, including five years of
grace. However, after Government approval to the proposed terms was obtained, the Bank
announced the expansion of the Single Currency Loan program to offer a fixed-rate option, and
CVRD expressed interest in selecting that option. CVRD qualifies for a fixed-rate single currency
loan because neither the Government of Brazil nor CVRD hold unconverted VLR82 outstanding
obligations. It is therefore proposed that CVRD would retain the option of changing to the standard
terms of a fixed-rate option until loan signing, subject to Government approval of the proposed
changes. The Loan Agreement would be changed accordingly prior to Loan signing.
Background
2.   Major environmental problems in Brazil include industrial and urban pollution, deforestation
and land degradation arising from weak enforcement of environmental regulations, rapid urbanization
and rural poverty. In the past few years, however, the Federal Government has, through modern
environmental legislation, established broad ambient quality standards, introduced procedures and
requirements for environmental licenses, set aside areas for the preservation of critical ecosystems,
and intervened whenever state agencies were not carrying out their responsibilities. In particular, the
federal law requires all enterprises, as a condition for issuance or renewal of operating and investment
environmental licenses, to submit comprehensive environmental impact assessments of their ongoing
operations and to implement the recommended mitigation plans. State environmental protection
agencies (SEPAs), are responsible for monitoring environment quality, developing local legislation
and emission standards and enforcing the law at the state level. However, only a few states have as
yet made significant headway in controlling environmental degradation, although all of them have
significantly increased pressure on the largest enterprises to comply with environmental regulations.
3.   Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) is a major mixed state-private company with mining,
industrial, transport and port operations, mostly clustered along two CVRD-owned 800 to 1000
kilometer railways, constituting the Northern System (in Para and Maranhao states) and the Southern
System (in Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo states). In the northern system, environmental
considerations were incorporated into project design and operations from the start. However, much
more needs to be done in the older southern system to meet current environmental standards. CVRD
has designed a program to deal with all the direct negative environmental consequences of its
operations, partly to improve its national and international image and partly in response to increased
institutional and community pressure made effective by the new environmental legislation. CVRD has
placed a high priority on implementing its environmental program within the agreed time frames for
compliance. In addition, despite excellent environmental management within its Carajas mining and
railroad concession, CVRD has been strongly criticized for the indirect contribution of the Bank-



financed Carajas iron ore project to environmental and social problems in the Carajas corridor in the
Eastern Amazon (see also para.7). This project will address some of the environmental impacts
attributed to the project and contribute to identifying solutions to help prevent further degradation and
enhance opportunities for environmentally sustainable development in the region. It is thus an
important element in the Bank's strategy to deal with environmental issues in Brazil.
4.   A source of deforestation in the Carajas corridor which has been attributed to the development
of the Carajas iron ore mine is the establishment along the railroad of charcoal-based pig iron
smelters. There are today six pig iron plants in operation, of a total capacity of about 768,000 tons.
Although this has been only a minor contribution to deforestation in the area, there are risks in the
future of increased pressure on the forest due to a projected reduction over time of available sawmill
residues, currently their major source of wood supply. Regulations were approved in 1990 for all pig
iron producers to secure their raw materials supply from plantations or managed forests by the end of
1995, but only one pig iron producer is expected to be complying with the law by then. Under the
proposed project, CVRD has agreed to carry out an action program which would use CVRD's
leverage on pig iron smelters derived from its position as iron ore and transport services supplier, by:
(a) conditioning the supply of iron ore and transport services on compliance with the law within an
agreed timeframe; (b) providing the smelters with technical assistance to prepare and carry-out
reforestation and forest management schemes and technological improvements aiming at minimizing
use of wood and charcoal; and (c) signing a cooperation agreement with IBAMA to ensure adequate
and timely monitoring of the actions taken.
5.   Bank environmental projects currently under implementation include the National Environmental
Project (Loan 3173-BR); the Second Industrial Pollution Control Project (Loan 2831-BR); the
National Industrial Pollution Control Project (Loan 3480-BR); the Minas Gerais Forestry Project
(Loan 2895-BR); the Parana Land Management Project (Loan 3018-BR); and the Rondonia and Mato
Grosso Natural Resource Management Projects (Loans 3444-BR and 3492-BR). All these loans
include components aimed at strengthening SEPAs. The Pilot Program to Conserve the Brazilian
Rainforest, financed by the G-7 and other donors, also include significant funding for actions aimed at
reducing the rate of deforestation, promoting environmentally sustainable development in the Amazon,
conserving biodiversity, protecting indigenous areas, and strengthening SEPAs in the nine Amazon
states.
Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement
6.   Given the wide variety of components in the proposed project, relevant lessons can be drawn
from a number of projects, but mostly from the Carajas Iron Ore Project and the Sao Paulo Industrial
Pollution Control Project.
7.   The Caraias Iron Ore Proiect (Loan 2196-BR) supported the establishment of the mining facility
at Carajas and was notable at the time for the heavy emphasis it placed on limiting the environmental
impact of the mine. The project was successful in terms of accomplishing stated project objectives,
but it had a number of unforeseen environmental effects which gained international publicity. The
Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) for the Carajas project stresses that, while environmental
management in the area directly under CVRD's control was excellent, and the Special Project aimed
at protection of the Amerindians in the project's area of influence did bring substantial benefits, the
Bank and CVRD failed to anticipate the contribution of this project to degradation of the physical
environment and human conditions in the project's indirect area of influence, due to strong migrant



- 3 -
inflows in the area facilitated by the construction of the Carajas railroad and roads. Chief among
these effects are social problems, in particular deteriorating health conditions of the population in
rapidly growing frontier towns unable to provide basic sanitation systems; pressure on Amerindian
communities from settlers, prospectors and loggers; and rural violence associated with land
concentration. Physical deterioration of the environment is evident in erosion and land degradation
caused by deforestation for agricultural and livestock use, often unsustainable activities caused by
poverty (subsistence needs of poor migrants), government fiscal and credit subsidies and land
speculation.
8.   Although it is difficult to isolate the share of CVRD from that of other unrelated programs
which preceded or accompanied the development of the project (the Belem-Brasilia and Belem-Sao
Luis highways, the Tucurui dam, the COLONE colonization scheme in Maranhao, the Serra Pelada
wildcat gold mine), the PPAR points out "a continuing moral obligation of CVRD to assist broader
official efforts to provide needed infrastructure and services to the rapidly growing rural and urban
populations-- as well as to limit environmental degradation-- in the region," and urges the Bank "to be
open to the possibility of providing additional assistance for socially and environmentally- sound
development projects in this area." The report also stresses the importance of institutional
strengthening at the federal, state and local levels; increasing public awareness and active community
participation in program design and monitoring activities; and the need for cross-sectoral approaches
to solving the region's problems. The Bank has already stepped up its efforts at natural resource
management and environmental institutional strengthening in a number of states, including those in
the region, through the National Environmental Project (Loan 2831-BR), and through its participation
in the Pilot Program Natural Resources Policy Project. The proposed project would seek to
contribute to the mitigation of the Carajas project's impact by: (a) preventing future degradation from
pig iron plants; (b) ensuring the continuity of CVRD's assistance program to Amerindian communities
initiated under the Carajas Iron Ore Project; (c) strengthening conservation and forest management
efforts of CVRD and increasing basic scientific and ecological knowledge of the area; (d) helping
identify and promote environmentally sustainable economic activities in the region to lessen the
pressure on the native forest by creating employment and reducing poverty; and (e) promoting
urgently-needed social infrastructure development (water supply and basic sanitation) in selected
towns along the railroad.
9.   The Sao Paulo Industrial Pollution Control Project (Loan 1822-BR . This project, approved in
1980, aimed at improving regional air and water quality by reducing industrial pollution and by
training SEPA staff to design and implement a pollution control strategy. On the whole, the project
was a success, and the impacts on overall air and water quality were significant, although not as
great as expected. The PPAR stresses that the Bank should not hesitate to invest in environmental
improvements, even if they appear non-productive. However, a long-term and broad-based
environmental program, strong political commitment at the state level and a strong environmental
agency are essential in order to ensure that the program will be effective.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
10.  The World Bank Group's current Country Assistance Strategy for Brazil, discussed by the
Board on June 29, 1993, and the new Country Assistance Strategy (expected to be presented to the
Board on June 29, 1995) both support policies and investments that will encourage economic growth
and social development in a context of macroeconomic stability. The Bank pursues four long-term
objectives to stimulate development in Brazil: (a) poverty alleviation and human resource



development; (b) environment preservation; (c) private sector development and public sector reform;
and (d) improvement in infrastructure by rehabilitating neglected infrastructure, promoting private
sector participation, and strengthening urban institutions. The proposed project is fully consistent
with the Country Assistance Strategy, contributing principally to the first two objectives, by reducing
industrial and mining pollution, protecting natural resources, providing basic sanitation infrastructure
to poor communities and assisting vulnerable Amerindian populations. More specifically, the project
deserves Bank support for the following reasons: first, the proposed investments fit into federal and
state priorities since CVRD is required to comply with the new federal legislation and with
agreements with state and municipal authorities; second, the Bank would contribute to the preparation
and implementation of a comprehensive environmental program in one of the largest industrial
conglomerates in Brazil, and to improvements in its organization, policies and systems, which could
be an example for other large industrial polluters in the country; and third, the project would help
correct and prevent further environmental degradation in the Carajas corridor, by: (i) ensuring that
pig iron smelters in the corridor will not cause further environmental degradation; (ii) ensuring the
continuity of the assistance program to Amerindian communities initiated under the Carajas Iron Ore
Project; (iii) providing urgent basic sanitation infrastructure to deprived communities along the
railroad; and (iv) identifying possible ways to mitigate the other negative environmental and social
impacts of the Carajas iron ore project, by using the strong research and implementation capabilities
of CVRD.
Project Obiectives
11.  The project has three major objectives: (a) to support the entire environmental program of
CVRD by financing high-priority investments throughout its operations; (b) to bring about changes in
CVRD's policies, systems and procedures needed to reinforce sound environmental and social policies
and management; and (c) to correct some of the negative indirect environmental and social impacts of
CVRD's operations in sensitive portions of its area of influence, in particular in the Carajas corridor.
Project Description
12.  To support these objectives, the project includes the following components: (a) air, water and
soil pollution control and land reclamation investments (58 percent of project costs) in CVRD's
mining, industrial, rail and port operations throughout the country; (b) natural resource investments (6
percent of project costs), which include reforestation activities with native species and the
conservation of natural forest and ecosystems in or near CVRD's installations; (c) socially oriented
investments (19 percent of project costs) contributing to the alleviation of social problems in
ecologically sensitive areas in CVRD's area of influence, including the continuation of the
Amerindian program (5 percent); the provision of water supply and basic sanitation infrastructure to
urban communities near CVRD's facilities (13 percent); and pilot rural extension and small business
development programs (1 percent); (d) studies, research. training, and technical assistance (3 percent
of project costs) including environmental impact assessments and monitoring (in particular at the
Tubarao industrial port); and socio-economic studies in CVRD's area of influence; (e) institutional
strengthening of CVRD (2 percent of project costs) through the establishment of a corporate
environmental information, monitoring and control and auditing system; and (f) other subprojects and
studies to be defined (12 percent of project costs) aimed at further controlling environmental pollution
and degradation identified as part of the environnental auditing program financed under the project;
and at improving knowledge and protection of natural ecosystems, and enhancing the welfare of
communities in CVRD's area of influence.



13.  The total financing required is estimated at US$109.9 million. The -proposed Bank loan of
US$50 million would finance 50 percent of total project costs, excluding taxes, equivalent to 45
percent of total financing required. An amount equivalent to about US$1.6 million was approved
under the Japan PHRD Fund to finance technical assistance for preparation of some of the
Amerindian and natural resource subprojects yet to be defined. Retroactive financing for up to 10
percent of the loan amount would be included for expenditures made up to 12 months before loan
signing. Such retroactive financing would help ensure the implementation of a number of subprojects
in time for CVRD to comply with the terms of its agreements with the SEPAs. The project would be
implemented over a five-year period. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and the loan disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of the Bank group operations in
Brazil are presented in Schedules C and D, respectively.
Agreed Actions
14.  During negotiations, CVRD agreed to: (a) provide timely and sufficient funds to cover the
project expenditures and provide counterpart funds equivalent to 50 percent of project expenditures
net of taxes; (b) maintain a debt/equity ratio not greater than 55:45 and a current ratio of not less than
1.2:1; (c) carry out its operations, cause its subsidiaries to take action, and take all further action in
its power to ensure that its affiliates carry out their operations in an environmentally sound and
socially fair manner and at all times comply with federal, state and local environmental regulations;
(d) forward to the Bank annual reports on its environmental performance and that of its subsidiaries
and participating affiliates; (e) continue to implement an agreed action program to ensure that pig iron
producers using iron ore supplied by CVRD in the Carajas corridor carry out their operations in an
environmentally sound manner; (f) prepare, and adopt within three months after effectiveness, a
statement of policies and procedures satisfactory to the Bank to govern CVRD's Amerindian program;
review and select subprojects and develop a methodology to monitor and evaluate their impact; and
carry out its program in accordance with this statement; (g) ensure that subprojects under the
Amerindian program meet criteria consistent with those established under Bank policy; and (h)
undertake a Mid-Term Review of project implementation in July 1996. The closing date would be
June 30, 2000.
15.  Conditions of Disbursements are as follows: (a) with respect to all subprojects, that the Bank
has approved the subproject; (b) that CVRD has signed satisfactory sub-loan agreements with each
participating subsidiary and affiliate and implementation agreements with participating public entities
governing the onlending of Bank funds; (c) with respect to investments in basic sanitation for
Amerindian communities, that appropriate mechanisms for operation and maintenance have been
established; and (d) with respect to demarcation of Amerindian reserves, that satisfactory contractual
arrangements with the National Indian Foundation (FUNAI) have been signed.
Proposed Exceptions to Section 9.03 of the General Conditions (Negative Pledge Provisions)
16.  CVRD has requested that the Bank grant a number of exceptions to the Negative Pledge
Provisions (besides the two exemptions already allowed under the Bank's provisions-- liens on
property to secure its purchase price and short term banking transactions) for the following liens or
transactions: (a) project financing; (b) short term non-bank trade financing (suppliers' credits); (c)
statutory liens; and (d) other secured debts (such as securitization of receivables) if and when
required, but limited to an aggregate of US$250 million-- an amount high enough to provide some



- 6 -
financial flexibility to CVRD but low enough to minimize risks to unsecured creditors (this upper
limit represents only 3 percent of CVRD's total assets as of the end of 1993, less than 4 percent of its
total equity, less than 10 percent of its total liabilities, and less than 12 percent of its consolidated net
revenues). It is proposed that the Bank should grant CVRD's request (the exceptions are incorporated
in a supplemental letter). The waiver would take effect as soon as the last agreement with lenders
with negative pledge provisions similar to the Bank's (including Loan 2196 BR, for the Carajas Iron
Ore Project) has expired (March 1998). Until this date, the waiver granted in conjunction with the
Carajas project (Loan 2196-BR) (liens up to an aggregate of US$10 million) would continue to apply.
17.  All loan agreements with international financiers entered into by CVRD in the early 1980s for
the financing of the Carajas Iron Ore Project included negative pledge provisions identical to that of
the Bank loan. Since the early 1990s, however, CVRD has successfully pursued a long-term financial
policy aimed at improving its ability to raise financing from international markets at better terms by
consistently negotiating relaxations to negative pledge provisions with its international creditors.
Since 1990, it has been able to obtain the same exceptions it is now requesting from the Bank to
negative pledge provisions on new financing from all its international creditors (bondholders under
two unsecured bond issues underwritten by Citibank and Chase Manhattan, and from Japan EXIM
Bank). All CVRD agreements containing Bank-type restrictive clauses (including Loan 2196-BR for
the Carajas Iron Ore Project) will have expired by March 31, 1998. Beyond that date, however,
CVRD will not be able to make use of exceptions granted unless it can obtain similar exceptions from
the Bank under the proposed loan. Finally, CVRD did obtain a blanket waiver to the negative pledge
provision under the Bank loan for the Carajas Iron Ore Project (up to an aggregate of US$10
million).
18.  CVRD states that inability to secure its borrowing limits its financial options and substantially
increases its funding costs. CVRD estimates 1.5 percent per year as the additional costs of unsecured
borrowing relative to secured senior debt. In addition, there are large differences in maturities (less
than five years for unsecured lending, compared with over eight years for secured project financing).
19. As stated in the Board Paper, dated July 19, 19902, "the Bank has on occasion waived its
rights in the case of liens created by Government-owned or controlled entities on their own assets and
as security for their own borrowing, for entities which meet the following criteria:
(a) the entity is established as a business corporation and conducts its affairs along the lines
of a private company;
(b) the entity is managed autonomously and is not included in the Government's budget; and
(c) the entity's activities have no material financial or economic significance in relation to the
ability of the Government to service Bank loans.
Waivers, however, have not normally been given for entities in the main foreign exchange- earning
sectors of a country and, in some cases, financial ceilings may be imposed on the amount of debt the
entity could secure".
2 "IBRD's Negative Pledge Policy with Respect to Debt and Debt Reduction Operations" (No. R90-151) -
July 19, 1990.



20.  CVRD meets all the criteria listed in the July 19, 1990 Board Paper:
(a) it is established as a business corporation. A total of 48.7 percent of its capital is
privately owned (24 percent of ordinary shares and 93 percent of preferential shares,
which have the same rights as common shares except for the right to vote in the election
of the members of the Administrative Council); and it conducts its affairs along the lines
of a private company;
(b) CVRD does not depend in any way on the Government budget; it is managed
autonomously and, because it has demonstrated financial autonomy from the government,
it is considered eligible for a single currency loan. Given its predominant export
orientation and large private participation in its capital structure, the Government has
refrained from interfering in the management of the company and has traditionally
appointed professional managers; and
(c) this waiver will not affect in any significant way the ability of either CVRD or Brazil to
repay its debt to the Bank. Altogether the proposed exceptions are not expected to
exceed US$250 million over 15 years, i.e., only 2.5 months of CVRD's exports and the
equivalent of two days of Brazil's total exports of goods. Brazil's debt service to the
Bank in relation to its overall public and publicly guaranteed debt service requirements is
small (15 percent in 1994, expected to decline to 11 percent by 1998), and Brazil's debt
service to the Bank in relation to its exports is also small (4 percent in 1994, expected to
decline to 3 percent by 1998)-- after considering the effects of the DDSR agreement.
Although the Bank's exposure in Brazil is significant (US$6.9 billion), the
creditworthiness of Brazil is expected to improve now that it has resolved the debt issue
with its creditors. A waiver of the Bank's negative pledge provision with regard to the
DDSR agreement was approved by the Board on April 7, 1994. Brazil is presently not in
arrears in its payments to the Bank.
21.  CVRD's export earnings (about US$1.3 billion, 94 percent of which are from sales of ores and
minerals) account for only 3.4 percent of Brazil's foreign exchange earnings from exports of goods.
Brazil has a diversified export base, and mining products accounted for only about 6 percent of
exports in 1993. Thus, CVRD is not in the main foreign exchange-earning sector of Brazil.
22.  CVRD depends on external markets for both its sales (60 percent of its revenues are from
exports) and its financing requirements (in Brazil's current context, domestic medium and long term
financing is not available), and is on these accounts an exceptional case among Brazilian public
enterprises. CVRD, however, like its competitors, needs to minimize its funding costs to maintain
competitiveness. Waiving the negative pledge provision as requested would be consistent with the
Bank's development objectives of helping public enterprises operate on commercial terms and on the
same footing as their private competitors, particularly when the requested exceptions are fully
consistent with normal business practices. Furthermore, CVRD is in a sound financial position and is
a competitive enterprise worldwide. The Carajas loan will be fully repaid by October 15, 1997 and
debt service requirements of the proposed new US$50 million loan are small compared to CVRD's
projected net cash flow. Prudent financial management of CVRD would also be protected by
financial covenants that have been negotiated under the proposed Loan.

Project Benefits
23.  Pollution control, land reclamation, conservation and reforestation, and improvements in public
sanitation and infrastructure will provide improved air, water and soil quality, leading to health
benefits for the surrounding population. The project will also generate substantial externalities: (a)
the project will contribute to the resolution of some difficult outstanding environmental issues
associated with CVRD's presence, in particular the pig iron plants issue; (b) programs aimed at
preserving and studying biodiversity, endangered fauna and flora species and natural forest
management, and recovery of degraded areas, in particular in the Amazon region, will bring global
benefits and make valuable contributions to ongoing international research and efforts in the
framework of the Pilot Program to Conserve the Brazilian Rainforest; (c) the carbon sequestered in
the Green Belts has an estimated value of US$8.7 million; and (d) the welfare of poor communities
close to its operations (Amerindians, population of Parauapebas and Itabira) will be enhanced by the
social infrastructure and services provided under the project and by efforts to promote self-sustainable
development and to identify workable solutions to land degradation and poverty issues in affected
areas. Finally, substantial benefits will be generated over time from the consistent adoption by
CVRD, a major and expanding mining and industrial conglomerate in Brazil, of sound environmental
principles and systems to ensure their consistent adoption throughout the group, thereby providing
institutional models for environmental projects in Brazil and elsewhere.
Project Risks
24.  The main risk of this operation is that CVRD may fall short of its commitments to control the
environmental performance of its own and its affiliates' operations and programs, and fail to carry out
actions to correct their indirect impact, especially if either: (a) the pig iron and charcoal production
problem is not acceptably resolved along the agreed lines; (b) demarcation activities still pending
(Awa and Krikati groups) and protection of Amerindian communities along the railway continue to be
delayed or are inadequate; or (c) generally, CVRD or its affiliates fail to comply with their legal
obligations or to adequately deal with adverse environmental and social impacts of their operations
and projects. However, under the project CVRD has committed itself to carrying out programs to
deal with these issues. Past experience with CVRD has shown that the company has consistently met
its commitments. Furthermore, the Bank has reviewed and participated in the formulation by CVRD
of its overall environmental organization, and will continue to follow the establishment of an internal
environmental information, monitoring and auditing system which would ensure that emerging
environmental and social problems arising for CVRD's and its affiliated companies' operations are
identified and addressed in time. Finally, covenants committing CVRD to sound environmental
management and social fairness and compliance at all times with the environmental legislation have
been included in the Loan agreement, providing remedies.
25.  The Government has announced its intention to privatize CVRD. However, it is not expected
that privatization would constitute a risk additional to that mentioned above. This is because
subprojects financed under the project and other commitments (such as the pig iron plant program)
either reflect commitments to State Environmental Agencies which would have to be met irrespective
of ownership, or will improve CVRD's international image, a concern of the current CVRD
management as well as of most major exporters to G-7 countries: failure to implement agreed action
plans could affect the company's image to such an extent that this is unlikely to occur. Also, the risk
of a new owner choosing to pre-pay loan proceeds already disbursed by the time of privatization
instead of implementing the project using Bank funds is low, first because the proposed exceptions to



the Negative Pledge provisions of the Bank's General Conditions would eliminate a major constraint
on financial management which the loan would cause otherwise, and, second, the counter-guarantee
which the Government usually requires from the new owners of privatized companies in order to
continue providing its guarantee to the Bank has already been agreed upon with CVRD.
Financial Benefits and Risks
26.  CVRD will benefit from reduced currency risks as a result of financing this project from a US
dollar single currency loan, since its export earnings are predominantly priced in US dollars while its
expenses and most of its debts are in local currency and other non- US dollar foreign currencies.
CVRD has sophisticated risk management capabilities by developing country standards, and can
manage any interest risk it faces as a result of the LIBOR basis of the single currency loan interest
rate.
Environmental Aspects
27.  This project is classified as a category "B" in accordance with Operational Directive 4.01. The
investments related to the project, which intend to address pollution and land degradation problems in
CVRD's facilities, are all well supported by complete documentation, all prepared by outside
consultants and compulsory under Brazilian law. Supplemental environmental analysis has been
carried out as needed for each operation and subproject, and it is not expected that any of these
investments, which are corrective in nature, will have negative environmental effects. The small
Amerindian components (totalling about US$4.9 million) are not related to any of the project's
investments, but constitute the continuation of the Special Amerindian Project included under the
Carajas Iron Ore Project, the impact of which has already been well documented in several OED
reports. Details of the program will be subject to the scrutiny of a specially appointed group of
experts and Bank review and actions will have to conform to the criteria established for Bank
involvement with tribal peoples. Their design will take into account knowledge accumulated in the
course of Bank supervision and auditing activities of the earlier project. Finally, other socially
oriented components include the provision of basic sanitation infrastructure to local communities,
which by their nature have positive environmental impacts.
Poverty Category
28.  This operation is not part of the Program of Targeted Interventions. However, several of its
components (Amerindian assistance program, provision of basic sanitation infrastructure and services
to poor communities) will primarily benefit the poor.
Program Obiective Category
29.  The project fits into the Bank's Environmentally Sustainable Development Program Objective
Category.

Recommendation
30.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank,
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it, including the proposed waiver of the
Negative Pledge Provisions.
