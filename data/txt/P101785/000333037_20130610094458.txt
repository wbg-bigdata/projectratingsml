F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the Project is to assist the Province of Aceh and 12 Local Governments
in Aceh and Nias to reconstruct/rehabilitate strategic infrastructure and to extend key
infrastructure services of adequate quality standards that meet the needs of communities
where infrastructure was damaged by the tsunami of 2004 and the subsequent earthquake.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
In essence, the project development objectives were not revised.

  However, as per amendment 1, the PDO in the PAD for the Additional Financing,
excluded the phrase "Province of Aceh and 12 local governments." This did not change
the substance or meaning of the PDO, nor the assessment of outcomes. Three additional
PDO key indicators (11 through 13 in the matrix below) were introduced to reflect the
specific investments of additional financing.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design


1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and sector context

The tsunami of December 26, 2004 and the subsequent earthquake killed or left missing
more than 230,000 people in Indonesia, and the total reconstruction and development
program for Aceh and Nias was estimated to cost up to US$9 billion through 2009. The
government of Indonesia (GOI) created a dedicated Rehabilitation and Reconstruction
Agency—Badan Rehabilitasi dan Rekonstruksi (BRR) —to lead the recovery efforts. The
BRR priorities were to (i) strengthen coordination between donors and government
agencies; (ii) ensure pledges for infrastructure are prioritized and matched with sector
needs; (iii) improve the quality and pace of infrastructure reconstruction supporting
housing/settlements; (iv) develop institutional resources for sustainable infrastructure
operations and services after the BRR’s operating period; (v) improve cost effectiveness
through quality management and competitive procurement; and (vi) and increase the
efficiency and flexibility of the capital works planning and budgeting process.

As of March 2006, approximately US$4.7 billion had been allocated by GOI, NGOs and
donors (including MDF) to specific rehabilitation projects and an estimated additional
US$3.7 billion had been committed but had not been allocated to specific projects. Of
this total of US$8.4 billion, US$535 million comes from the MDF’. This total of US$8.4
billion appears sufficient given overall funding needs to: (i) cover the original loss
assessment across all sectors from the tsunami and earthquake o f U S$4.9 billion; (ii)
cover anticipated cost increases o f U S$ 1.2 billion resulting from inflation; and (iii)
build back better (US$2.3 billion) according to the GOI’s stated objective. However,
BRR, donors’ and NGOs’ interests and focus are varied across sectors according to their
comparative advantage and preference and this has resulted in some mismatch between
available funds and financing needs. Infrastructure, in particular, showed a deficit of
available funds for reconstruction of about US$650 million.

Damage to infrastructure was substantial and progress slow. To the extent that both
physical infrastructure and staffing were limited before the tsunami, (for e.g., in the water
and sanitation sector, there were no sewage systems and less than 30 percent of the
population were provided with piped water), building back better would require
substantially more investment than simply replacing what was lost. Sectoral funding gaps
resulting from a mismatch between available funds and financing needed further strain
reconstruction efforts. Lack of sufficient funding was particularly severe in the transport
sector, and to a lesser extent in flood control and in irrigation. The funding deficit in the
transport sector was a critical issue as an efficient transport network was vital for the
delivery of rehabilitation and reconstruction assistance and for overall economic
development.


                                             1
To determine the allocation of remaining MDF resources and to provide a strategic
approach to infrastructure design and management, BRR has outlined an Infrastructure
Reconstruction Strategy. This strategy serves as a framework for rehabilitation tailored to
addressing infrastructure needs at the district and provincial levels, in particular,
infrastructure linking communities. The core approach is to engage local governments, in
collaboration with affected communities, to prioritize and manage their own
infrastructure needs, within a framework of strong planning and oversight by BRR, with
appropriate technical assistance (TA)’. BRR’s medium-term strategy for the MDF
comprises three main priorities:

   (i)     Remaining MDF resources should be predominantly used for the
           reconstruction and development (i.e., building back better) of infrastructure,
           broadly defined, at the housing plot, community, district and provincial levels.
   (ii)    The provision of infrastructure should be closely matched with capacity
           building efforts for local and provincial governments through learning by
           doing approach and community participation for enhanced governance to
           prepare for the BRR's handover of recovery activities to local and provincial
           governments in 2009.
   (iii)   Though the initial focus will on the areas most damaged by the tsunami and
           earthquake (with a particular focus on Nias), infrastructure support and related
           capacity building should be gradually extended to districts of Aceh where
           years of conflict stunted economic and human development.

The BRR Infrastructure Reconstruction Strategy encompassed three phases: (i) the
execution o f t he ongoing MDF-supported Immediate Action Plan (IAP) agreed upon in
November 2005 to meet urgent infrastructure needs; (ii) the Infrastructure Reconstruction
Enabling Program (IREP), which provided technical assistance for the mobilization of
human resources and technical support to BRR, provincial, and local governments; and
(iii) the Infrastructure Reconstruction Financing Facility (IRFF), which financed local
and provincial level infrastructure sub-projects, provided targeted technical assistance
and capacity building to local governments to plan, implement and strengthen
implementation oversight of the infrastructure reconstruction program, and facilitated the
transition of infrastructure program management to provincial and local governments.

Rationale for Bank Assistance

As a leading international development agency in the area of post-disaster reconstruction,
with a longstanding engagement with relevant government agencies in Indonesia and
around the world, Bank’s involvement in Indonesia’s community-driven development
program also provided a platform to quickly replicate stakeholder consultation,
participation mechanism and scale up financing to specifically address reconstruction
needs.

GoI had also asked the Bank to take a lead in coordinating the donor community,
requesting suggestions on how this could be handled in practice. In March 2005, the
Bank formally established the "Multi-donor Trust Fund for Aceh and North Sumatra"
(MDTFANS), later simplified to "Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias (MDF)". The


                                            2
Bank also provided at the same time a grant of US$25 million as a contribution to the
MDF. In all, 15 funding agencies contributed an initial US$550 million to the MDF. The
Bank and the European commission channeled all their support through the MDF, while
the Nordic countries, the Netherlands and Belgium provided half or more of their funding
through the MDF.

Project Background and development

It was noted that most of funds pledged to support rehabilitation and reconstruction in
Aceh were quickly programmed by the GoI leaving gap to finance minimum needs in
certain critical areas. BRR’s strategy, therefore, was to focus on the remaining available
funds to ensure that they were allocated to cover these gaps. Of the donor resources, the
MDF was the largest source of programmable funds with US$230 million available.
Among other priorities, BRR’s medium-term strategy calls for the main utilization of the
remaining MDF resources for the reconstruction and development (i.e., building back
better) of infrastructure on the areas mostly damaged by the tsunami and earthquake in
Nias and Aceh. The GoI has, initially allocated $119.5 million from its own resources to
supplement the MDF grant.

In order to guide the investment program during BRR’s assignment period, BRR
developed an Infrastructure Reconstruction Strategy. This strategy encompassed three
phases: (i) the execution of the ongoing MDF-supported Immediate Action Plan (IAP)
agreed upon in November 2005 to meet urgent infrastructure needs; (ii) the proposed
Infrastructure Reconstruction Enabling Program (IREP), which would provide technical
assistance for the mobilization of human resources and technical support to BRR,
provincial, and local governments; and (iii) investment in infrastructure works by BRR
and other donors, including through a proposed Aceh Infrastructure Reconstruction
Facility (IRFF). The implementation of IRFF would be financed through the MDF and
the GoI (while the technical support would be managed under IREP).


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The objective of the Project was to assist the Province of Aceh and 12 Local
Governments in Aceh and Nias to reconstruct/rehabilitate strategic infrastructure and to
extend key infrastructure services of adequate quality standards that meet the needs of
communities where infrastructure was damaged by the tsunami of 2004 and the
subsequent earthquake.

The key Performance Indicators for this development objective at appraisal were:

(i)    Proposals of infrastructure sub-projects financed by IRFF will include a set of
       indicators, including use of infrastructure, quality, user satisfaction, cost and
       timeliness that will be used to measure performance during sub-project
       implementation and after sub-project completion. Monitoring mechanisms, to
       assess the level of compliance with sub-project performance criteria will be put in
       place;


                                            3
(ii)    Infrastructure sub-projects financed by IRFF after the infrastructure development
        strategy drafted to reflect the priorities laid out therein;

(iii)   Technical designs of infrastructure sub-projects are sound and appropriate;

(iv)    Proper financial and safeguards measures are integrated into the preparation of
        infrastructure sub-projects financed by IRFF;

(v)     Implementation of infrastructure sub-projects financed by IRFF is adequately
        supervised;

(vi)    Performance and financial audit reports (in addition to external audits financed
        under IREP) of financial statements of infrastructure sub-projects financed by
        IRFF are prepared;

(vii)   A progressively increasing proportion of projects, is managed by local and
        provincial government staff over IRFF project cycle;

(viii) A progressively increasing proportion of projects managed by local and provincial
       government staff over IRFF project cycle incorporate appropriate safeguards
       measures, financial management and procurement practices during project design
       and implementation.

(ix)    Maintenance of infrastructure sub-projects reflects asset maintenance strategies
        developed by IPM/IREP consultants;

(x)     IPM/IREP consultants design institutional mechanisms according to
        local/provincial government capacity to sustain sub-project implementation and
        supervision responsibilities of BRR after the completion of BRR’s mandate;

(xi)    A comprehensive survey designed to assess the state of infrastructure service
        delivery, in the 12 districts of Aceh and Nias that are benefiting from IRFF
        financing of individual sub-projects will be conducted at the beginning and at the
        end of IRFF. Additionally, the survey will assess beneficiaries ‘satisfaction with
        infrastructure investments made in their respective communities as well as their
        quality at the end of IRFF.


As per our assessment, indicator xi would be considered as intermediate indicator rather
that PDO key indicator.


1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification




                                            4
In essence, the project development objectives were not revised. However, as per
amendment 1, the PDO in the Project Paper for the Additional Financing, excluded the
phrase “Province of Aceh and 12 local governments.? This did not change the substance
or meaning of the PDO, nor the assessment of outcomes. Three additional PDO key
indicators were introduced to reflect the specific investments of additional financing.

(i)     Improved Access from Calang to Meulaboh across the Kuala Bubon Bridge.

(ii)    Efficient travel between Calang to Meulaboh across the Kuala Bubon Bridge. The
        bridge will eliminate the lee way between Km216 and Km 234.

(iii)   Restoration of the destroyed environment of the wetlands across the West Coast
        Road and around the Kuala Bubon Bridge


1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The primary, direct beneficiaries of the IRFF were the people of the provinces of Aceh
and Nias (4,487,000 and 757,000 inhabitants respectively), who benefited from the
rebuilding and restoration of essential infrastructure services such as roads, ports, water
supply, sanitation, flood mitigation, and drainage.

Achievement of the project objectives was intended to in turn support higher level goals
of fostering economic growth and improving the quality of life in Aceh and North
Sumatra. The geographic coverage of IRFF at local government level spanned, primarily,
12 local governments, 9 of which benefitted from IREP (7 local governments in the West
Coast and 2 in Nias), as well as 3 other local governments (Aceh Besar, Banda Aceh and
Sabang). At the provincial level, IRFF included strategic projects, prepared by the
provincial government with IREP support.

As amended (amendment 1), some of these projects were located outside the jurisdiction
of the 12 local governments to cover the East Coast and central parts of Aceh. During
implementation additional financing was approved for investments outside the original
sub-project eligibility areas as reflected in Amendment 2 to the IRFF - TF057657 grant
agreement. These investments, focused on road transport and access, benefited not only
the people near the sub-projects, but the wider population in the disaster-affected areas.

In addition, the BRR, MoPW, PMU, PIU, local governments, and local contractors and
subcontractors were secondary beneficiaries of the project through the increase of their
project management capacity and the implementation of Aceh and Nias reconstruction
program.


1.5 Original Components (as approved):




                                            5
The IRFF of US$291 million, co-financed by MDF and BRR, originally consists of two
main components that would be implemented over the January 2007 - January 2010
period. A detailed description of the project components is provided in Annex 2

   Component 1 - Financing of Infrastructure Reconstruction and Rehabilitation
    Investments (US$273.0 million) to finance individual infrastructure reconstruction
    sub-projects in 12 local governments - 9 of which benefiting from IREP TA, and 3 of
    which receiving technical advice from existing consulting arrangements, as well as
    strategic investments at the provincial level. Each individual infrastructure sub-
    project was to be co-financed by BRR and MDF, according to a 70:30 ratio. This
    component was to provide resources for civil works and goods in sub-projects in the
    following sectors: roads, ports, water and sanitation, drainage, flood control, coastal
    protection and restoration of major irrigation canals.

   Component 2 - Targeted Support to Infrastructure Sub-project Planning, Design,
    Supervision, and Implementation Oversight (US$3.0 million): This component
    aimed at (i) strengthening the ability of the Aceh Besar, Banda Aceh and Sabang
    local governments to improve the provision of infrastructure in their respective
    jurisdictions by providing technical experts to assist them in planning and sub-project
    identification, sub-project design, document submission, procurement, safeguards
    compliance, implementation, construction supervision, and monitoring (US$2
    million); (ii) supporting performance and financial audit (over and above external
    audit) of the project financial statements (US$0.6 million); and (iii) providing
    technical assistance for transition to a post-BRR timeframe and institutional
    arrangements beyond April 2009, including extension of TA provided under IREP,
    and capacity building and infrastructure asset maintenance programs for local and
    provincial governments (USS0.4 million).


1.6 Revised Components

    i.        As per amendment 2, Financing of activities under Component 2 of the
              original project shifted to IREP, thereby releasing the allocated budget of
              US$3.0 million to Component 1. BRR decided to keep the focus of IRFF on
              the physical reconstruction and the technical assistance to be delivered
              through the IPM of IREP project.

    ii.       The Additional Financing (AF), in the amount of US$36.7 million, scaled up
              these two components by including the following activities:

             Reconstruction of a major section of the west coast national road between the
              key cities of Calang and Meulaboh (West Coast Road), from about kilometer
              marker (Km) 198 to Km 247 including the Kuala Bubon Bridge and related
              waterway ecological and environmental restoration. The road, bridge and
              local ecosystems were severely impacted by the December 2004 tsunami and



                                              6
           the subsequent earthquake. The estimated cost of the physical works was
           US$33.8 million.

          Engineering services for design reviews and implementation supervision of
           the West Coast Road, and program management. The estimated cost of these
           activities was US$2.9 million.


1.7 Other significant changes

   Expansion of sub-project eligibility area. The project was amended in January 2008
    to modify and expand the area in which disaster-affected communities and
    infrastructure were eligible for sub-project financing, and also introduced the West
    Coast Logistical Area into the definition of the project’s geographic scope. The West
    Coast Logistical Area added the kabupatens of Aceh Basear, Banda Aceh, and
    Sabang to the kabupatens listed in the original agreement (Aceh Jaya, Aceh Barat,
    Nagan Rava, Aceh Barat Daya, Aceh Selatan, Aceh Singkil, and Simeulue). It also
    allowed the flexibility to include additional kabupatens upon written agreement with
    the Bank.

   Closure of BRR and transfer of implementing agency role to Ministry of Public
    Works. Since the BRR’s mandate was scheduled to expire and the agency would close
    after April 15, 2009, the legal agreement was amended to transfer project
    implementation responsibility to the Ministry of Public Works.

   Closing date extensions. The project closing date was extended three times, by a total
    of 30 months (from June 30, 2010 to December 31, 2012). These extensions were
    required because of slow initial progress in implementing the original project
    activities, but dominated by the need to allow for the new road and bridge
    rehabilitation and reconstruction activities financed by the additional financing
    approved in August 2010.

   Additional financing and new road and bridge investments. In August 2010 the Bank
    approved the government’s request for additional financing of US$36.7 (TF098082)
    from the MDF to finance road reconstruction (and related design and implementation
    support) along a 50 km long segment of the West Coast Road, including the Kula
    Bubon Bridge. As mentioned previously the project closing date was extended as a
    result.

   Change in the project estimated cost and GoI contribution schedule: The MDF
    contribution remained the same as US$100 million to finance 30% of goods and
    works and 10% of the consultancy services. There was no reference to the GoI
    contribution in the GA but the PAD referred to government contribution of 191
    million (70% of the total estimated project cost of US$291 million). However, and
    after the final preparation of the sub-projects priority list, the GA was restated and
    amended (amendment 2, February 16, 2009). The GoI contribution was explicitly


                                            7
    defined in the restated grant agreement to be US$119.5 while the MDF grant
    remained unchanged at US$ 100 million. In addition, the financing mechanism was
    amended so that the MDF would finance 30% of expenditure incurred before
    February 16, 2009; 100% of expenditures incurred for Type 2 sub-projects and Type
    3 sub-projects on or after March16, 2009; and Type 4 sub-projects on or after
    February 16, 2009. Eventually, the GoI fulfilled their obligations and its contribution
    came to 119.53 million1.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

Soundness of background analysis. The background analysis, incorporation of lessons
learned, and rationale for the Bank’s involvement were all very solid. There was a clear
and timely assessment of conditions on the ground, sectoral priorities and financing needs,
phasing of investments, and balance between conducting sound analysis and proceeding
with preparation without unnecessary delays. Analysis of infrastructure needs,
government strategy, and rationale for Bank involvement are discussed in more detail in
Section 1.1. Incorporation of lessons and analysis and mitigation of risks are described
below.

Assessment of project design. The objectives, components, safeguard policies, monitoring
and evaluation, and other implementation arrangements of the project were relevant to
the recipient’s priorities and the beneficiaries’ needs and appropriate to their capacity and
the types of investments planned. A key rationale for the Bank’s participation was
expressly to serve as the coordinator and lead partner agency for the MDF to simplify and
increase the efficiency of the donors contributions to reconstruction, and to take
advantage of the Bank’s existing involvement in Indonesia’s emerging national CDD
program, which had already begun developing local consultation and participation bodies

  Type 1 sub-projects have been completed as of December 31, 2008 and no further implementation
arrangements are required.

For each Type 2 sub-projects and Type 3 sub-projects, BRR shall remain responsible for the
implementation of such approved sub-projects until the date on which all necessary government action has
been taken to transfer such approved sub-projects to the respective implementing agency which shall occur
by no later than March 16, 2009 (each, a “sub-project Transfer Date)

For each type 4 sub-projects: BRR shall remain responsible for the implementation of such approved sub-
project (but without budget authority, which has been transferred by the recipient to the implementing
agency as January 1, 2009) until the date on which the Satker to the approved sub-project for 2009 in the
implementing agency has been appointed which shall occur by no later than February 28, 2009 (each, a
“sub-project Transfer Date?).

and mechanisms that could play a similar role in helping to implement disaster
reconstruction efforts. The IRFF was planned to work in conjunction with its sister
project, IREP, to ensure that there was an adequate enabling environment for successful
implementation of the investments.

Adequacy of government commitment, stakeholder involvement, and participatory
processes: As explained in this and other sections (particularly Section 1.1), there was
unusually strong government commitment and participation in preparation of the project,
including the creation of a temporary government agency expressly for the purpose of
carrying out this and other disaster reconstruction projects. Involvement and participation
of local stakeholders were clearly demonstrated in the readiness of all local and
provincial governments who committed the budget and compensated all impacted land
and house owners throughout the project implementation.

Main challenges and risks identified during preparation. Considerable attention was
given to identifying risks, which were considered high, and putting in place appropriate
measures to effectively mitigate them. In order to optimize the design of the IRFF, the
task team conducted a review of the first year of the reconstruction efforts, and concluded
that the main challenges had been: (i) the geographic spread, sector diversity, and the
scale of the program to be delivered, (ii) high (and probably unrealistic) expectations
including BRR’s ability to deliver the program quickly, local firms ability to provide
sizeable inputs, and communities and local governments to provide input into the
planning, implementation and absorption of the program, and (iii) the significant time
constraints to deliver benefits quickly and to complete GOI’s investments before April
2009, when the BRR’s work was expected to be completed and the agency would close.
The Bank also diagnosed that BRR’s major bottlenecks and impediments to effective
implementation to be (i) the inadequate procurement systems, (ii) the inadequacy of
BRR’s quality assurance program and monitoring system and the inability of satkers
(Satuan Kerja Perangkat Daerah, responsible for day-to-day implementation and
overseeing civil works contractors) to effectively monitor their individual programs, and
(iii) the inadequate implementation capacity throughout BRR, satkers and local
government (and construction contractors).

Lessons learned from similar operations: Based on this on-field diagnosis and similar
reconstruction/rehabilitation efforts, the design of the IRFF took in some lessons which
included: (i) the need to balance local level planning and overall reconstruction needs to
design a sub-project planning process originating at the decentralized while ensuring the
efficient coordination and management of available resources; (ii) the importance of
speedy reconstruction while upholding the quality of construction by utilizing high
quality expertise through the IREP TA to support the speedy delivery by BRR of the
infrastructure sub-projects; (iii) the need for local ownership of reconstruction efforts,
addressed through the management (satkers) being local government employees and
through the ownership of BRR-built assets to local/provincial governments; (iv) the need
for transition of overall infrastructure reconstruction management from BRR to local and
provincial governments to sustain reconstruction activity beyond the duration of BRR ’s
mandate in April 2009. This was mitigated through the support to BRR to design

institutional mechanisms detailed in a transition strategy to ensure that Government
bodies would keep meeting the obligations of BRR beyond the scheduled expiration of its
mandate.


2.2 Implementation

Project implementation was completed by the project extended closing date and within
budget. The following were factors affecting the project’s implementation.

   Capacity constraints and implementation delays: The implantation of the project
    suffers from delays at the beginning as the appointment of the IPM under IREP took
    several months after the start of IRFF. In order to expedite the implementation, the
    Bank and the BRR had agreed to start the screening of the first and second batch of
    priority sub-project. The list was completed at the time IPM was selected.

   Reducing the project cost: The project cost at appraisal was estimated at 291 million
    (100 million as grant from MDF and US$191 million contribution from GoI). This
    coast has some generous contingencies built into it. However, real contract values
    lead to lower costs. This lead to lowering the GoI to 119.5 but without compromising
    the implementation of the sub-projects priority list.

   BRR Fixed prices contracting policy and “Gaps?: These gaps were primarily due to
    the use of fixed price contracting mandated by BRR. As all contracts awarded for the
    construction work were “Fixed Price Contracts? as per BRR requirements, the scope
    of works often required adjustment in projects to take into account site specific
    conditions that were not previously evident or anticipated. This often led to crucial
    items, such as stabilized shoulders or adequate drainage, being omitted to stay within
    the contract sum. In some cases an overall reduced target (i.e., a shorter road) was
    delivered. A gaps analysis was done which identified possible supplementary works
    requiring funding in order to meet the original scope of works. Residual funds from
    IRFF were used to fund these activities

   Additional Financing: New investments along the west coast of Aceh were identified
    that would strengthen achievement of objectives. This has been met through the
    approval of AF and extension of the project closing date.

   Expiration of the BRR and review of implementation arrangements: Since the
    beginning the project envisaged the necessity of phasing out the implementation
    arrangement from BRR which was established as an interim agency to expedite the
    reconstruction of Aceh and Nias. The BRR was closed in February 2009 and the
    implementation arrangements were transferred to MoPW through the Presidential
    Regulation No. 3 2009. IRFF PMU, which was tasked with all remaining
    reconstruction work, was set up within MoPW and staffed with former BRR staff
    leading to a very smooth transition without disturbing the pace of the project
    implementation. Due to the diverse nature of the sub-projects and to maintain the


                                           10
    integrity of the project activity, this PMU was requested to report directly to the
    MoPW Secretary General’s Office. The consultants funded by IREP continued to
    provide support to the PMU to ensure proper implementation and program
    management for the IRFF project. The IREP and IRFF Grant Agreement amendments
    were signed (April 15, 2009 and Feb 16, 2009 respectively) to reflect the new
    arrangements.

   Implementation arrangements for the AF. As the implementation of the original
    priority sub-projects under IRFF was winding up, the additional financing was
    approved to finance the newly identified sub-projects along the west coast of Aceh.
    The MoPW preferred to establish a new PMU within the Directorate General of
    Highways (“Bina Marga?) which, by law, is the responsible body for the construction
    and development of all national roads, to oversee the implementation of the additional
    financing sub-projects.

   Restructuring: As explained in more detail in Section 1.7, the project was restructured
    five times to clarify the geographic scope of the project, formalize the transition to a
    new implementing agency, extend the closing date of TF057657, approve the AF
    grant TF098082 and to extend the closing date of TF098082. The restructurings were
    fairly routine in nature, but helped to ensure proper targeting, smooth implementation
    and alignment of IREP with IRFF (and in particular with the additional financing and
    extension of IRFF).

   Relationship between IRFF and IREP: The IREP project financed the reconstruction
    program management, sub-projects design and construction supervision and the
    financial management of IRFF. Until its closing on December 31, 2011, IREP was
    used to finance the design and the initial construction supervision cost for the IRFF-
    AF sub-projects. These functions were pursued through the appointment of a new
    construction supervision consultant which was financed from the proceed of the AF
    grant.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design: The project design included well-conceived, appropriate outcome
indicators that were clearly linked to the development objectives, verifiable either
quantitatively or qualitatively, and attributable to project interventions. Due to the
importance of the M&E in both guiding project implementation and assessing outcomes,
and the shortcomings in the capacity of BRR, the design called for the IPM to provide
support in carrying out the M&E functions. The design called for the development of a
computerized Monitoring Information System (MIS) which was expected to facilitate the
monitoring of outcome indicators and routine project implementation and financial
management for both IREP and IRFF

M&E Implementation: IPM successfully produced regular M&E reports, which were
integral parts of the Semi Annual Reports that compiled data provided by the PDCS and



                                            11
FM consultant (and confirmed by IPM quality assurance staff). In addition, the PMUs (of
the two grants, TF057657 and TF098082) developed a Monthly Portfolio Review for a
quick monitoring of the progress of all projects under IRFF and updated the performance
indicators matrices for both IREP and IRFF.

The efforts of IPM to develop a stand-alone computerized MIS were not fully successful
and the system was never used as the focal database for the program. Development of the
system took longer than expected, and ultimately the BRR developed its own MIS system
which made a separate system specifically for IREP redundant and unnecessary. While
the MIS was intended to monitor both physical progress and financial performance, the
shortcomings and delays in the MIS system did not significantly hinder monitoring of the
KPIs, many of which were qualitative in nature.

M&E Utilization: The data and information gathered from the field were compiled by the
IPM consultant and communicated to the PDCS consultants to review the designs of
some sub-projects. In some cases this led to revisions in technical designs or investment
priorities to ensure the relevance, effectiveness, and efficiency of investments. For
example, in some roads projects it was determined that the underlying soil or adjacent
slopes were more unstable than anticipated, and therefore timely steps were taken to
strengthen the road shoulders to reduce the likelihood and mitigate the impact of potential
landslides. To maximize the returns from BRR’s MIS, it had been centrally connected to
Bappenas’ MIS which enabled sharing of the project information at the central level, and
increased both the usefulness and longer term sustainability of the M&E systems.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance


Safeguards Compliance

Rating: Satisfactory.

The project was classified as Category A (Full Assessment) for safeguards. The specific
policies triggered were Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01), Indigenous Peoples
(OP/BP 4.10), and Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12).

Environmental Safeguards: (Satisfactory). The only environmental safeguard policy
triggered by IRFF was the environmental assessment (OP/BP 4.01).

Environmental safeguard management was generally satisfactory, due to the significant
involvement of Bank supervision teams in environmental safeguard management,
focusing on resource extraction impacts (primarily sourcing of sand, gravel and other
quarry material) and construction impacts (excavation, fuel spills, noise and dust
management, obstruction to drainage, pollution and sedimentation of water courses). In
addition to the Bank regular supervision missions, Bank staff based in Banda Aceh and
Jakarta carried out periodic field visits to review construction progress, quality and



                                            12
safeguard aspects. As a matter of practice, the key findings were provided immediately
to the BRR, IPM and design consultants upon return from the field, with detailed
recommendations and target dates for completion of actions. Through IREP, reports by
the design consultants added significant value in terms of quality improvement of
implementation.

The Construction Environmental Action Plan (CEAP) model proved to be very useful and
positively impacted environmental performance under the construction contracts. For
instance, a template for a CEAP for a typical road project was prepared by the IPM
consultants, which helped to improve the quality of the plans, and ultimately the quality
of implementation.



Social Safeguards: (Satisfactory). The social safeguard policies triggered by IRFF were
the Involuntary Resettlement and the Indigenous People. All land acquisition which took
place in IRFF (10 sub-projects) covering road, drainage, seaport and water supply, were
carried out in a satisfactory manner. Land Acquisition and Resettlement Action Plans
(LARAPs) were prepared for sub-projects involving land acquisition that was identified
prior to construction. These sub-projects acquired land from nearly 66 people. Land was
acquired through negotiations and by cash compensation at or above market price. Two
road sub-projects obtained land through donation by the adjacent beneficiaries. Social
Management Plans or Land Acquisition Implementation Reports (LAIRs), including
remedial actions were prepared for land acquisition not anticipated during the design
stage or that took place during sub-project construction. Sub-project designs were
adjusted to minimize or avoid land acquisition during the planning and construction
stages.

As for the AF, despite the large number of people (1,200) affected by the additional road
and bridge rehabilitation (due to widening the right of way and the alignment of the road
to comply with the national standards), resettlement issues were concluded appropriately,
mainly due to the proactive involvement and rigorous monitoring and commitment of the
local authorities at the provincial and district level.

As per the indigenous people, no issue was encountered.


Fiduciary Compliance

Procurement: (Satisfactory). The procurement plan was fully implemented and all
services were acquired in accordance with the Bank guidelines. Procurement on the 56
contract packages of IRFF (signed contract value of US$ 223.62 million), 4 additional
contracts under AF (signed contract value of US$ 31.51 million) and 8 consultancy
contracts (signed contract value of 18.39 million) was generally satisfactory and timely.
The IRFF procurement phase was completed in 18 months.




                                           13
There were 4 awarded contracts (Calang Port, Idi Rayeuk – Keude Geurobak and Tapak
Tuan – Batas Sumut roads, Nias JK-2)terminated due to the performance of the
contractors or to safety and security reasons in the project area, but these were terminated
in line with contractual provisions. Three of the four affected sub-projects were
completed by the line authorities while the fourth, Nias JK-2, is still under consideration
to be completed by the MoPW.

Overall, the major factors in the successful completion of IRFF procurement could be
identified as the following: (i) the deployment of well-qualified and experienced
personnel at the helm of CPU (however, not all the procurement committees had quality
members, due to BRR staffing limitations), (ii) advice provided through IREP to the CPU
on the finalization of the procurement plans, and (iii) the Bank direct involvement as the
packages subjected to prior review of the Bank took on average ten days less time than
the packages subjected to post review.

However, it could be argued that the short-term objective of speed of procurement was
achieved at the expenses the long term goal of building capacity in local governments
through the decentralization of within one year of start of procurement, which affected
down the line the smooth transition of the project from BRR to local authorities. Another
weakness in the IRFF procurement program was the lack emphasis placed on the
technical assessment of the capacity of the contractors, as the design consultants were not
involved in the selection of the contractors they ultimately had to supervise

Financial Management: (Moderately Satisfactory). In general, Financial Management
(FM) was in compliance with Bank procedure and external audit reports were concluded
with unqualified compliance. However, the following issues were identified during the
early stages of project implementation:

      Delays in the issuance of budget documents (DIPA). The delays were mostly due
       to the appointment of PPK/satkers on a yearly basis, PPK/satkers who were
       responsible for the DIPA process. Mitigating measures were introduced, including
       provision of FM consultant to assist new PMU/PIUs.

      The Interim Financial Report (IFR) submissions were chronically late, despite the
       Bank missions’ systematic reminders that PMU (through IREP 5) should submit
       them 45 days after each quarter closes. The Bank also recommended that the
       PMU should implement a financial penalty to any underperforming consultants
       who submitted their reports late. These delays were also a reflection of the
       dysfunctional MIS, as the FM consultant (IREP 5) could not rely on a
       comprehensive and up to date monitoring database and information flows with the
       three other consultants (IPM and the three PDCS) were not smooth. IREP 5 did
       not have access to some contract amendments, or IPM did not receive updated
       physical progress information from PDCS in a timely manner. Numerous
       occasions arose where the FM consultant received conflicting information from
       the contractors and the PDCS consultant on the progress of works, especially in




                                            14
       Nias. These delays improved during the later stages of the project as the FM
       consultant proactively compiled and consolidated IPM and PDCS reports.

      Financial control systems were also problematic, especially on payment
       documentation, verification, delayed submission of financial reports and audit
       reports. Following a Bank supervision mission that noted that less than a third of
       payments were verified, in mid-June 2009 the PMU gave clear instructions to the
       FM consultant to review and verify all payment requests prior to submission to
       the Treasury Office (no payments would be made unless invoices were verified by
       the FM consultant).

      Financial management remained problematic for the AF, notably in terms of
       payment delays for consultant and contractors. Low disbursement remained a
       significant issue, as the ICR mission in November 2012 noted that financial
       progress lagged 30% on average behind physical progress. The mission also noted
       that the international consultant was paid only in September 2012 for work that
       had stared in January 2012, and only for the local currency component. Similarly,
       the mission has noted the growing frustration and financial constraints of local
       contractors due to the payment delays, which could have an impact on the earlier
       completion of civil works. As for IRFF, extremely slow payment verification at
       the Satker and flaws in their internal control systems, as well as DIPA 2012
       revisions explained the delays. These payments backlogs required an intensive
       effort from the Satker and the PMU to process all pending payments prior to the
       end of disbursement date.

      Refund of excess payments: During the implementation of the project, excess
       payments took place in relation to: (i) Calang port sub-project (US$156,518.80);
       (ii) Gap 2 contract (US$457,057.60); and (iii) the Nias JK-2 contract
       (US$616,546.90). In addition, remaining fund in the project designated account of
       US$1,133,658.58 needed to be refunded. The MoF refunded the first trench of
       US$1,290,177.38 to account for both Calang port sub-project excess payment and
       the remaining unused fund in TF057657 designated account. The MoF confirmed
       to the Bank that the remaining balance of US$1,073,604.50 had been scheduled to
       be paid from the 2013 DIPA allocation of the MoPW. This has not been settled
       yet and the Bank is following closely with the MoF. The issue is critical as these
       funds need to be returned to the MDF and the donors, preferably, before its
       closing date on June 30, 2013.



2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Arrangements for maintenance of the assets (including institutional capacity, ownership,
commitment, and availability of resources) are an important issue in ensuring the
sustainability of the project outcomes.



                                           15
Out of the 56 completed sub-projects under the IRFF 17 sub-projects, comprising 50 %
of the grant cost were handed over to the central authorities (5 ports to the Ministry of
Transportation; and 12 national roads to the MoPW). Those sub-projects are being
managed following the national standards and using national budget allocations.

9 provincial road sub-projects comprising 24% of the total asset cost were handed over to
the Aceh and North Sumatra provincial governments. As with other provincial assets,
these roads are being managed by the Provincial Dinas with adequate maintenance
budget allocations.

Assets directly under the authority of the central and provincial governments, such as
national roads, have already been assigned maintenance funds to transfer the assets to
local governments, who would ensure the adequate budget allocation for maintenance
MoUs for assets handover were signed.

For the remaining sub-projects (26% of the total assets) that belong to local authorities,
memoranda of understanding (MoUs) for handover (based on a standard template drafted
by IREP consultants) have been signed between BRR and local governments. The formal
transfer was completed on December 31, 2012, except for the Nias JK-2.

The maintenance budget will be included in the DIPA revision in August 2013, and the
MOF liquidation team dedicated to the handover task has committed to finalize the
transfer of Nias JK 2 by the end of March 2013. However, preparedness and financial
capabilities of local governments need to be carefully and continuously monitored. The
Bank has been reassured at the district and provincial levels that financial and human
capacities will be devoted to preserve the sustainability of the project assets, and that
budget allocations will reflect that commitment, as was confirmed by Aceh Badan
Perencana Pembangunan Daerah Bappeda.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

As a reconstruction project, the relevance of objectives as stated in the PDO is, strictly
speaking, not as relevant in a post-reconstruction environment once the objectives are
achieved. However, the clearly understood objective is to rebuild infrastructure that will
continue to be relevant to the recipient’s and beneficiaries’ needs, and to help ensure its
longer term sustainability. In this sense, the project objectives remain highly relevant to
the development priorities of Indonesia. The development of large-scale infrastructure
remains crucial to the country, and is a pillar of the Bank engagement (Core Engagement
2) as outlined in the 2008-2012 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The document
recognizes the need to strengthen the accountability and capacity of institutions to deliver
better infrastructure outcomes.




                                            16
In terms of reconstruction needs themselves, the objectives, design, and specific
investments were clearly relevant and continue to be relevant to the affected population,
which relied on the restoration of the destroyed community and transportation
infrastructure to enjoy services and access critical to their quality of life and development
opportunities. Community consultation and participation in defining priority needs during
project preparation and implementation helped ensure the relevance of the investments
and sub-projects. During implementation the geographic scope and eligibility criteria
were modified to better target resources where they were most needed and effective, and
additional financing was approved to expand investments to road and bridge
reconstruction identified during implementation as high priority needs. The coordination
of the project with IREP was very effective in helping ensure that there was an
appropriate enabling environment to carry out the investments.

The project objectives are also highly relevant to the Bank strategy to play a major role in
disaster reconstruction, helping to reduce Indonesia’s vulnerability to natural disasters as
outlined in the CPS (Core Engagement 5). The document stressed that the Bank would
continue deepening the relationships established with Bappenas and the local
governments of Aceh and Nias in supporting selected elements of the Government’s
actions to strengthen natural disaster resiliency.

Implementation arrangements were consistent with the country policy to build capacity
within national institutions. After BRR closed in 2009, the implementing agency of IRFF
became the MoPW. The new PMU was tasked to handle remaining construction work in
Aceh, and was staffed with many former BRR officials for continuity. New streamlined
implementation arrangements were put in place to manage the AF. The new PMU was
created within the Directorate General of Highways (“Bina Marga?) which, by law, is the
responsible body for the construction and development of all national roads, to oversee
the implementation of the AF sub-projects.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Satisfactory

Assist the Province of Aceh and Nias to reconstruct/rehabilitate strategic
infrastructure and to extend key infrastructure services of adequate quality
standards that meet the needs of communities where infrastructure was damaged by
the tsunami of 2004 and the subsequent earthquake:

The PDO has been achieved in a satisfactory manner as 56 infrastructure reconstruction
sub-projects (52 from the original IRFF and 4 from the AF) have been built in Aceh and
Nias in sectors as diverse as roads or water supply. In total 4 ports, 7 water supply
installations, 4 water resources (flood management and sea defense) projects, 10 national
roads (including 3 under AF), 9 provincial roads (7 in Aceh, 2 in Nias), 21 district roads
(19 in Aceh, 2 in Nias), and one bridge were effectively constructed. 4 projects (3 district
roads and one port) were terminated, due to issues related to the selected contractors’
performance as in the case of Calang port or due to security reasons as in relation to Nias



                                             17
JK-2 sub-project. It is interesting to note that all of these sub-projects, precluding Nias
JK-2, had been re-contracted and completed from the GoI own budget.

These sub-projects contributed not only to the reconstruction of impacted infrastructure
but also to better build Aceh and Nias compared to the pre-disaster conditions. Indeed
more than 5.2 million inhabitants in Aceh and Nias benefitted from the project.

The project has contributed to the economic growth and the improvement of the quality
of life of Aceh and Nias. This is evident from (i) the improvement of sea and land
connectivity and mobility; (ii) the improvement of the local community livelihoods and
the stimulation of local economic growth (increasing the number of cargo boats and
docks loading and unloading consumer items, processed products and crops. In particular,
cloves and palm crude oil have increased by more than 20%); (iii) the development of
new economic growth contributors such as restaurants, shops, hotels and public services
facilities (which all increased the districts disposable income); (iv) the improvement of
the Banda Aceh’s solid waste management through the construction of sanitary landfill
with recycling and composting capacity; and (v) the better provision of clean water
supply.

The project has achieved all the planned key performance indicators and managed to
engage the local, provincial and central governments to be involved in the development
of the priority sub-projects which represented the truly needs of the communities.

As an assurance to its sustainability, all assets were properly designed and their
construction has been satisfactorily supervised through international consultants. All
projects, except for the Siron Water Pipe Bridge and the Siggli Water Intake, proved
robust and credible detailed engineering design. The Bank and the international design
consultants continually stressed the importance of technical consistency to the local
government administrators and contractors continuing to address. Thus, design
specifications were mostly met through continued check testing and validation, thickness
of road construction layers and quality of site processed materials were reported to be
adequate, longitudinal drainage was made gradually effective, and shoulder/slope
stabilization was given appropriate consideration. The IRFF gaps exercise also enabled
adjustments in projects to take into account site specific conditions that were not
previously evident or anticipated (mainly shoulder stabilization and drainage).

The elaborative layers of the assets quality assurance made it redundant to conduct a one
shoot asset survey to assess the assets status. Besides the quality assurance and controls
carried out by the IPM, the CSCs, BRR, PMU, and PIU on continuous basis, the MoPW
and the MDF have conducted asset assessment surveys which confirms the compliance of
the assets quality with the good practices and the well functionality of all completed
assets even many years after the commissioning of part some sub-projects.


3.3 Efficiency




                                            18
Rating: Satisfactory

While no financial or economic feasibility study was conducted, it is evident that the
project provides high value for money. It had enabled the reconstruction of some strategic
and important infrastructure projects which had evident foot prints to the revival of the
Aceh and Nias economy as discussed in section 3.2.

All sub-projects were tendered competitively and the costs were consistent with the
norms of the construction industry in Indonesia.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The project achieved its primary development objective to assist the Province of Aceh
and Nias to reconstruct/rehabilitate strategic infrastructure and to extend key
infrastructure services of adequate quality standards that meet the needs of communities
where infrastructure was damaged by the tsunami of 2004 and the subsequent earthquake.
The project financed the construction of the large infrastructure program of 56 sub-
projects to come to fruition in a timely and adequate manner, for the benefit of the people
of Aceh and Nias.

In summary, IRFF project achieved its development objectives, and remains highly
relevant to the country infrastructure and disaster mitigation priorities. During the
implementation, sub-projects were properly designed and designs were reviewed to
respond to reality checks in terms of quality assurance, financial management,
environmental safeguards and social safeguards. The post-completion operation and
maintenance problems were identified and mitigated for the most part. As such, an
overall rating of satisfactory is justified.

The completion of the west coast road sub-projects became critical. Until the last
supervision mission (three months before the project closure) the implementation
progress was 70%. Under the high risk of missing part of the grant, MoPW gathered a
great deal of momentum together with the contractors and the construction supervision
and made the completion of the works as their top priority. This effort paid back and the
works were completed just before the closing date.

Due to the successful completion of the west coast sub-project, the PDO was upgraded to
Satisfactory. Through the implementation of the project, the task team selected to be in
the conservative side during previous missions and rated the PDO as Moderately
Satisfactory for the doubt of not completing the work and the delays which the project
suffered at the start of the AF.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

   (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project funded the construction and supervision of 56 sub-projects including ports,
roads, general water and sanitation/flood protection and water supply. Although no socio-
economic impact study was conducted, the project has positively impacted the
livelihoods of Aceh and Nias through (i) the improvement of sea and land connectivity
and mobility; (ii) the improvement of the local community livelihoods and the
stimulation of local economic growth (increasing the number of cargo boats and docks
loading and unloading consumer items, processed products and crops. In particular,
cloves and palm crude oil have increased by more than 20%); (iii) the development of
new economic growth contributors such as restaurants, shops, hotels and public services
facilities (which all increased the districts disposable income); (iv) the improvement of
the Banda Aceh’s solid waste management through the construction of sanitary landfill
with recycling and composting capacity; and (v) the better provision of clean water
supply.

In terms of impact on gender, BRR had proposed special provisions in IRFF for
empowering women throughout the IRFF project cycle. In effect addressing gender
considerations was achieved through direct solicitation of inputs from women’s groups
during early review of proposed project designs (particularly for water and sanitation, and
market projects) and obtaining women’s inputs on investment prioritization through focus
group discussions, or rehabilitation and reconstruction activities in Sabang that included
provision of domestic facilities for local women (including a building for washing).

   (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Strengthening the capacity and the incentives of local governments, which was decimated
by tsunami, to prepare, implement and maintain infrastructure projects with BRR and
after BRR’s closure was a key priority of IRFF. Several initiatives were taken to
maximize the local government involvement in the sub-projects prepared local authorities
for the post-BRR era. These efforts included local governments’ capacity assessments
and gaps analysis, in-depth training in procurement, safeguards, anti-corruption support
as well as in quality assurance, planning, budgeting, assets management strategies and
construction supervision. Also, the Transition Strategy developed prior to BRR’s exit in
April 2009, enabled exchanges of experience between all Aceh and Nias local
governments involved in infrastructure reconstruction and development.

The day-to-day involvement of the PIUs and the PMUs in the review of the design
documents and the construction supervisions and their interactions with the international
consultants had strengthened their capacity in such areas and the management of
shortfalls remedy after the preliminary handover of the sub-projects.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

N/A


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

Design and Implementation Risk: The IREP program has enabled proper design and
construction of good quality infrastructure and has mitigated the risk of short life and/or
failure of the assets. As mentioned earlier (see Section 2.5), the majority of large IRFF
sub-projects are managed at the national and provincial levels, where capacity to
maintain them and budgetary resources are adequate.

Capacity Risk: Roads sub-projects which were transferred to the local authorities might
very well be affected by poor asset management and maintenance. It was intended during
the design of the project to incrementally transfer greater responsibilities in planning,
budgeting, procurement, construction management, operation and maintenance from
BRR to local governments, but in effect these responsibilities were centralized until
BRR’s closures. Local government capacity assessments and capacity building programs
plans recommended a focus on institutional development, an improvement of existing
systems and human resource development in order to ensure adequate operation and
maintenance in the future, and in-depth training and workshops were subsequently
organized for local governments to that effect. Substantial training of local government
staffs was also provided by various international organizations and NGOs. These efforts,
focused on implementation support, long-term operations and development infrastructure,
mitigate the risk to the development outcome but have not built lasting institutional
capacity.

Maintenance Budget Risk: The other major risk, common for decentralized infrastructure,
is the lack of funding for future operation and maintenance. This risk is significant for all
assets that are not managed at the national and provincial levels and the likelihood of
falling short is high. While the impact would be high if there was no O&M, it is likely
that there will be some resources, capacity, and commitment to O&M. In such event, the
impact will be incremental and assets may deteriorate or need major rehabilitation
somewhat earlier than their planned design life Assets.

On the other hand, under the authority of the central and provincial governments (i.e.,
national roads, ports and regional roads), maintenance funds are part of the traditional
fiscal budgeting. The non-effective resolution of the status of the assets raises this risk
further, as they have not been effectively transferred yet despite the signing of the MOUs.
MOF will need to liquidate the assets as a first step, enabling in a second step the


                                             21
effective commitment of funds from the local government. Both of the central
government and the Province of Aceh confirmed their commitments to help the local
governments to get the resources needed through the fiscal budgeting

Natural Disaster Risk: It is likely that there will be more earthquakes, so assets
vulnerable to earthquake damage were designed to mitigate the risk of earthquake
damage. This was applicable mainly to some strategic sup-projects like Kuala Bubon
Bridge and the sea ports.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

In light of the institutional, budgetary and, above all, time pressures at the time of
preparation due to the post-disaster emergency situation, the Bank team designed the
program in an effective, flexible and satisfactory manner. The team clearly and
adequately intended to give priority to swift and quality implementation in a complex
environment where institutional capacity had been decimated by the tsunami, with
multiple partners and institutional entities (BRR, donors, central, provincial, district
authorities), and where the area scope for the projects extended from Aceh to the island
of Nias.

The simplicity of the design (with 2 components) was a key factor behind the success of
IRFF, albeit aided by the fact that most technical, supervision, and program management
tasks were covered by IREP. The methodology set out for identifying the sub-projects to
be financed by IRFF also contributed to quick and quality implementation, as it was
agreed that BRR would provide an initial prioritized list of candidate sub-projects
proposed for IRFF funding. The review and final selection by the Bank of these pre-
screened projects through eligibility criteria explicitly defined in the Annex 4 of the PAD
(sector and geographic location, appropriate design of technical solutions, economic and
financial viability, compliance with agreed-upon environmental, social, and fiduciary
safeguards safeguard approach under IRFF) enabled the timely identification of the most
relevant assets to be funded, with no trade-offs in terms of safeguards.

It is noted that the project cost was over-estimated. This is due to the uncertainty in
budgeting for the works in the devastated areas. The conditions in Aceh and Nias were
not very attractive and the team rightfully accounted for high contingencies. However,
the high pace of recovery led to lower bid cost than the estimated price. Thus, the
decrease in the GoI contribution did not affect the achievement of the PDO




                                            22
While project did not put enough emphasis in effective training in infrastructure
management, operation and maintenance of local government staff, this has been covered
under the IREP and other technical assistance programs implemented by the BRR.

 The lack emphasis placed on the technical assessment of the capacity of the contractors
(the design consultants were not involved in the selection of the contractors they
ultimately had to supervise) led to extra effort in quality assurance and control during
implementation.


(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

All stakeholders have time and again insisted that the proactive, problem-solving
centered and trust building approach followed by the Bank supervision team played
no small part in the success of the project. The team in Jakarta and Banda Aceh
provided hands-on oversight of the project with a strong emphasis on implementation
quality, technical designs, and financial management reporting, resettlement issues and,
overall, rigorous Aide-Memoire follow up. The team was also instrumental in the smooth
implementation of the post-BRR institutional requirements with MoPW, Bappenas and
MoF and effectively coordinated other donors’ involvement in Aceh Province.
Comments provided by line ministries, agencies and local authorities staff have all
indicated deep appreciation for the respectful working relationship and the flexible and
constructive approach that was established, despite the complexity and urgency of the
reconstruction task at hand in a post-disaster environment.

Task Team Leaders initially followed the project from Washington DC but were in
continuous contact with infrastructure team members who were based in Banda Aceh.
This turned out to be critical for such a large size post-disaster reconstruction program.
Moreover, in late 2010, the TTL was re-located to Jakarta which further enhanced the
quality of supervision. This supervision set up and the permanent presence of Bank staff
in the reconstruction areas ensured continuous Bank oversight throughout project
implementation. The Bank’s supervision strategy resulted in relatively high supervision
costs which were financed from the MDF and which considered the success of the project
a top priority.

Moreover, the Bank’s policies and procedures were applied consistently. Supervision
missions were conducted in a professional and constructive manner, and mission teams
consistently included the experts needed to discuss relevant supervision topics and issues.
The timing of formal supervision missions (on average twice a year and supplemented by
frequent routine supervision missions by the TTLs and the task team members who were
based in Banda Aceh) was appropriate and comments received from PMU and
BRR/MoPW staff indicated a respectful working relationship and a flexible approach by
Bank staff.       Aide Memoires, Management Letters, ISRs and other project
communications and documents were completed in a timely manner with clear references



                                            23
to needed actions covering all aspects of project components, safeguards and fiduciary
issues. Such actions were summarized and followed by the team to ensure that the BRR,
PMU and PIU were following on the implementation of all recommendation and the
response to any shortfalls in a timely manner.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank’s overall performance rating is based on satisfactory ratings for both quality at
entry and supervision.


5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Performance of GoI was satisfactory, especially in terms of the strong and sustained
commitment to the project development objective. The agencies (MoF, MoPW and
Bappenas) turned out to be extremely cooperative and very effective in taking decisive
action in a timely manner, in particular with regard to the Bank recommendations on
implementation activities, including channeling the budget allocation (DIPA) and
preparing sufficient yearly budget allocation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Performance of the implementing agencies was satisfactory. BRR and the MoPW
protected the integrity of the project and sustained its development objective. The
performance of the MoPW as an implementing agency encompasses the PMU for the
original sub-projects and established a regional office of the MoPW’s Directorate
General of Highways for the sub-projects added as part of the additional financing. As an
independent agency, BRR performed effectively, and in four years was able to channel
and manage not only the resources of IRFF and IREP, but grant financing totaling more
than $6 billion (funded by all donors including the MDF) for a wide range of other Aceh
reconstruction projects. This fast pace was supported by the strong authority which BRR
was granted and enabled it to avoid most of the bureaucracy faced by line ministries.

Despite the smooth transition of the implementation arrangements, the slowdown of the
implementation of IRFF project was clearly noticed following the closure of BRR and the
handover of the implementation to the MoPW where the PMU was functioning more as a
Program Management Unit and effective implementation was mostly managed by a
number of PIUs which sometimes were difficult to coordinate. This setup required the



                                            24
Task Team to devote extra efforts to ensure compliance with the Bank fiduciary and
safeguards procedures and guidelines.

Taken into account the IRFF experience, the implementation of the IRFF-AF was
improved and functioned well since the PMU-AF was strengthened by 7 Individual
Consultants who were supported the PMU and protected the integrity of the project and
sustained its development objective up to the completion of the projects.



(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Both GoI and the Implementing Agencies (BRR and MoPW) managed to implement the
IRFF and the AF with Satisfactory performance.


6. Lessons Learned

Quality and simplicity of the project design: As clearly demonstrated through the four AF
sub-projects, simplicity of design is a key factor of success in environments where the
multiplicity of stakeholders (from donors to PMU to PPK/Satkers to the construction
supervision consultants (CSCs) to contractors to district, provincial, central authorities),
suboptimal administrative processes, weak local capacity, large resettlement requirements
and wide geographical project area scope are bound to make implementation complex.
Thus the project design was simple and included two components only: the first one to
finance infrastructure investments, the second one to fund capacity building.

Institutional arrangements: The scope of the devastation caused by the tsunami, the size
of the reconstruction program and the specificities of the historical institutional
relationship between Aceh province and the central government meant that achieving the
right implementation management for the recovery efforts was not a given and that the
reconstruction process would not be as effective due to their weak capacity and the
complexity of the central government bureaucracy. However, the creation of BRR by the
GoI to lead the reconstruction, to strengthen coordination between donors and
government agencies, to ensure that the pledges for infrastructure works were matched
with the various sector needs, was undoubtedly a major determinant of the effectiveness
of the reconstruction program. Most of all, the fact that BRR was given a limited lifetime
created a sense of urgency in the daily proceedings of BRR and ensured that all efforts
were focused on completing the mandate of the BRR and not on expanding nor sustaining
its administrative reach.

Maintenance and sustainability of assets: Careful attention should be provided to ensure
the preparedness of local governments to handle the assets, budgetary space for funding
of maintenance activities, existing capacity in infrastructure management within local
governments, and adequate status of assets. These concerns relate exclusively to the local


                                            25
governments road assets as national and provincial roads are under the authority of
MoPW and the provincial government respectively and will not pose maintenance issues.

For future operations, a focus on the effective training in infrastructure management,
operation and maintenance of local government’s staff, on the planning for making
maintenance funds available, and on the follow up on transfer of assets to local
governments could be recommended. Sustainability of infrastructure assets is also
enhanced when they are effectively used: some of the port sub-projects are not
operational yet despite their physical completion, even if neither project identification nor
implementation are at fault here (regulations and administrative oversight conflicts are
delaying start of service, but there are plans for at least one port to be soon operational as
a container hub).

Quality Assurance: Using international consultants does not guarantee good construction
qualities unless the consultants are properly resourced, supported, and operate in an
institutionally clear environment. Conflicting stakeholder interests and long delays in
payment can affect the consultant (and the contractor) performance, as was evident for
some IRFF and AF sub-projects. Consideration by Bank teams of these realities before
contracts are awarded and during supervision helped streamline the dialogue between all
parties and enabled to take gain from international expertise. Also, and in order to
improve the QA monitoring approach for future large infrastructure programs in
Indonesia, the short-listing process for procurement could place greater emphasis on
technical capacity, with design consultants being involved in pre-qualification screening
of tenderers on the basis of perceived capability, a national contractor database could be
put in place to inform on the performance history of contractors, more capacity building
for underperforming contractors could be conducted in order to achieve quality outcomes
at the outset rather than going to expensive reworking of substandard work, and quality
performance-based incentive payments could be considered.

CEAP approach: Introducing the CEAP approach was on the balance successful, but its
implementation could have been improved on a number of aspects. Training contractors
in CEAP implementation could have been for instance an important step in getting
CEAPs adopted more successfully. For instance, it proved difficult to get contractors to
take seriously asphalt spill management at construction base camps. Similarly, and in
light of the novelty of the CEAP, better ownership of the PPK and satkers could have had
a direct impact on the dialogue with contractors. Simple measures as watering of planted
trees and the maintenance of drainage and side vegetation on areas of prepared slope
protection could have been given more consideration through supervision. Finally, MOUs
for assets transfers signed by local government needed to include environmental
maintenance and all relevant departments with environmental authority probably should
have been included in the scope of the MOUs.

Stakeholder Participation and Commitment: The project is a successful example of
stakeholder participation and commitment, which led for instance to the satisfactory
design of the sub-projects priority list and the support of the various authorities to




                                             26
facilitate and safeguard project implementation. Stakeholders included the central,
provincial and local governments; local communities, NGOs, Donors, MDF and the Bank.

Implementation Support Arrangements: Both the MDF and the Bank acknowledged the
necessity to be closer to the project area, and the MDF supported the opening of a field
office in Banda Aceh so that several infrastructure specialists on the Bank task team were
based. This proximity to the center of activity greatly facilitated implementation on a day
to day basis and provided continuous support to the client.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Grantee/Implementing Agencies/Donors

(a) Grantee/Implementing agencies

In general, the government of Indonesia was satisfied with the project’s outcomes. The
original implementing agency (BRR) was closed in 2009. The borrower completion
report and comments on the ICR were prepared by the Ministry of Public Works
(MoPW), and were mostly related to procurement, project and contract management,
safeguards management and financial management and DIPA,

   Procurement: The PMU of the AF was newly established and entrusted to oversee
    the implementation of the west coast road including Kuala Bubon Bridge. The Bank
    had offered training to the project tendering committee and the PMU. However, the
    relative complexity of the evaluation of the bids resulted in some delays before
    clearing the bid evaluation report. In accordance to the instruction to bidders,
    contractors would be selected based on the least combined cost of JNB-1, JNB-2,
    JNB-3 and JNB-4 lots. The responsiveness of bidders was not straight forward and
    the Bank requested the PMU to review the BER based on additional information and
    to provide concrete evidence for the exclusion of any offer. Despite the prompt
    response of the Bank, the PMU was struggling in providing clarifications as these
    clarifications would need to be solicited from the Tendering Committee who would
    be difficult to convene all of its members. Thus the final recommendation was
    somehow different from the first recommendation made by the Tendering Committee
    and proved to be to the best interest of the client from economic and quality point of
    view.

    On the other hand, the Bank insisted on presenting the court decision related to the
    Bankruptcy of one of the contracting companies. Though this seemed to be a
    legitimate request, the PMU struggled to finally get an official copy and submit it to
    the Bank.

    The Task Team acknowledges the time constraints and the pressure to expedite the
    project implementation but without compromising the fiduciary aspects. This was
    made clear to the PMU and the approach was to hold frequent meeting and talk
    directly to make sure that comments related to the evaluation reports and procurement
    aspects are well understood.



                                            27
    In relation to the selection of the construction supervision consultant (CSC), it was
    communicated to the PMU that the shortlist should be comprised of 6 consultants (as
    per the Bank guidelines for the selection of consultants) but not 5. The PMU did not
    act promptly on the issue and kept arguing about the sufficiency of 5 without trying to
    invite and extra firm.

    The task team insisted that all designs to be reviewed prior to launching the
    construction contract. The practice in Indonesia to delay the review to the contractor
    mobilization stage was rejected and thought to be unacceptable. Especially for bridge
    and elevated roads design, the review was considered crucial prior to bidding as
    material changes to the design and the bill of quantities after bidding may lead to
    enormous risks of design robustness and significant variation in the contract price. In
    fact, the review enriched the available design which was debated between the MoPW
    and the consultant as to increase the bridge and road safety and resilience to
    earthquakes and floods.

   Finacial Management: The Task Team As raised in the Grantee ICR report, the
    project suffered from payment delays to contractors as well as consultants. This was a
    result of the internal system bureaucracy, delays in DIPA allocation and the
    complicated payment review process. The Bank realized this and raised the issue in
    front of high racy officials from the MoF, Bappenas and MoPW which helped in
    processing all payments, though at the last 6 months of the project.

   Environmental Safeguards: The project witnessed improvement in the
    environmental safeguards management. The major impacts related to cross drainage
    in the elevated roads and the stabilization of the road shoulders were well managed as
    part of the construction contracts. Other environmental improvements were captured
    under the CEAP. The only shortfall was noticed with the plantation of the swampy
    areas. Rushing the plantation increased the mortality rate and many trees died at the
    beginning. Later, contractors were requested to replace the dead treas.

   Social Safeguards: The realignment and widening of the west coast road affected
    1398 land parcels. Thanks to the readiness and cooperation between the provincial
    and local authorities, all owners were compensated satisfactorily. The PMU and
    MoPW played a very important role in coordinating the efforts and the compilation of
    land acquisition and compensation report.

   PMU expenses after the project closure: As per the grant agreement, it is not possible
    to finance any activity from the proceeds of the grant after the closing date. The
    funding of the PMU was flagged to the MoPW and it was made clear that it would be
    the GoI responsibility to finance the closing activities.

The Multi-Donor Fund (MDF) was also generally positive about the outcomes of the
project (see Annex 8 for comments provided by the MDF Secretariat). The Bank
appreciates the inputs and support of the MDF in preparing the ICR, and concurs with the
MDF about the challenges faced the completion of the IRFF AF subprojects and the
tremendous effort made by the Central, Provincial and Local Governments to compensate
all affected people from the land acquisition for the west coast road. It is also worth
noting that the GoI contribution to the IRFF reached US$119.5 million including
financing the completion of the Gaps works and the terminated sub-projects.

                          Annex 2. Outputs by Component


Component 1: Financing of Infrastructure Reconstruction and Rehabilitation
Investments: 60 sub-projects totaling 241.27 million (121.77 from MDF and 119.5 from
GoI) have been effectively implemented covering wide-ranging areas including 5 ports,
43 roads, one bridge, 7 water supply and sanitation and 4 water resources sub-projects.
This includes the early terminate 4 sub-projects which were completed by the GoI line
agencies. Table 2.1 lists these sub-projects and illustrates showing their costs. The table
also shows the lengths of the various roads that were reconstructed and /or rehabilitated.
The total length is estimated about 900 km. While, water supply and sanitation projects
were localized and benefited communities in Siggli, Sabang, Siron, Lhokseumawe,
Langsa, Gampong Jawa, roads and ports benefitted the entire population of Aceh
province and Nias. These sub-projects have facilitated both goods and people movement
and enhanced the internal and external connectivity of both Aceh and Nias. Moreover,
the construction of the west coast road segment from Calang to Meulaboh complimented
the 250 km road which was constructed by the USAID and thus maximizing the benefit
of the entire road. Attachment 1 illustrates pictures of some representative sub-projects
before, during and/or after construction.

Intermediate results have been mostly met as design specifications have been well
defined for all sub-projects, as approved sub-projects derived from local priorities, as all
sub-projects had provisions for adequate implementation of EMP and LARAPs, as
quality supervision of sub-projects implementation was carried out and as proper
financial audit reports were prepared. The pictures at the end of this annex demonstrate
the project value added by comparing the status of some strategic infrastructure before
and after the project.


Component 2 - Targeted Support to Infrastructure Sub-project Planning, Design,
Supervision, and Implementation Oversight: Originally, this component aimed at (i)
strengthening the ability of the Aceh Besar, Banda Aceh and Sabang local governments
to improve the provision of infrastructure in their respective jurisdictions by providing
technical experts to assist them in planning and sub-project identification, sub-project
design, document submission, procurement, safeguards compliance, implementation,
construction supervision, and monitoring (US$2.0 million); (ii) supporting performance
and financial audit (over and above external audit) of the project financial statements
(US$0.6 million); and (iii) providing technical assistance for transition to a post-BRR
timeframe and institutional arrangements beyond April 2009, including extension of TA
provided under IREP, and capacity building and infrastructure asset maintenance
programs for local and provincial governments (USS0.4 million). However, and in
accordance to Amendment 2, the component budget was reallocated to component 1. And
its scope was implemented and financed from the proceeds IREP project. Later, and to
account for the closure of IREP which was financing the design, construction supervision,
financial management and project management of IRFF, US$2.9 million were allocated
to cover these costs.


                                            31
The components financed the construction supervision of the 4 sub-projects under IRFF
additional financing from January to December 2012. It also financed the project
management, the financial management and the incremental operating costs of the PMU
during the same period.

                    Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The Project is of a reconstruction nature and no economic and financial analysis was
made. However, The construction cost is consistent with the industry practice in
Indonesia. At the beginning of the reconstruction, It was anticipated that the costs will be
inflated by the fact that Aceh and Nias would be not attractive due to the scale of damage
resulted from Tsunami and the subsequent earthquakes. However, the intense presence of
relief agencies and the mobilization of BRR contributed to the creation of a healthy
competitive market.

The construction of roads, ports, water supply and sanitation systems and water resources
sup-projects not only contributed to rebuild the impacted infrastructure transformed Aceh
and Nias to a much better place compared to what they were before the disaster. The
flourished economic and livelihoods activities around the constructed roads and at
today’s busy roads had been witnessed and the overall improvement of the people quality
of life was recorded in the “Route to Recovery? booklet. The booklet summarizes the
feedback from the interview with people who benefitted directly from more than 20 sub-
projects.

US$2,226,380 over 7 years (this includes US$ 36,000 from Spanish TF030867) and is
approximately 3 times as high as normal supervision coefficients for Indonesia.

                       Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

No structured beneficiary survey was conducted. However, the project interviewed
number of beneficiaries (mainly from the communities) and their responses were
captured and consolidated in a booklet “Routes to Recovery in Post-Tsunami Aceh and
Nias?. The booklet was published in 2012 and signed by the Governor of Aceh, the
Secretary General of the Ministry of Public Works, the World Bank Country Director in
Jakarta and the MDF Steering Committee.

The booklet intended to provide a sketch of the local people’s responses towards selected
projects and the impact they may have had on their everyday lives. The views of local
public officials, such as district chiefs and senior administrators were sought for this
report. Most of the commentaries, however, came from people speaking out openly and
honestly on how they viewed the changes taking place around them following the
construction of new streets and the rehabilitation of damaged facilities.

              Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

No workshop, per say, took place. However, on November 21, 2012 in Banda Aceh MDF
organized a seminar to share the results of IRFF and IRFF AF with stakeholders
(including the MDF, MoPW, BAPPENAS, MoF, Provincial Government of Aceh, local
governments, local NGOs, community individuals) and discuss lessons learned. The
seminar highlighted that the project represented a good model of partnership between GoI,
MDF and the Bank. It emphasized that the project objective had been achieved by closing
date December 31, 2012 through the reconstruction, repair and rehabilitation of roads (44
roads sub-projects totaling around 900 km), ports (5 sub-projects), sea defense flood
control (4 sub-projects) and water supply and drainage systems (7 sub-projects). At the
end of the seminar, MDF has published a press release summarizing the project outcomes
and acknowledging the good cooperation between all parties including the Bank, the
implementing agencies and the GoI.

The seminar also highlighted that the scope of the project was developed by the BRR as a
national agency (an agency which was established to manage the donors’ contribution to
alleviate the impacts of the tsunami and the subsequent earthquake) in close cooperation
with the local authorities and communities. The list of priority sub-projects was appraised
by the Bank task team and constituted the scope of the IRFF project.

The seminar noted that the project was widely spread and benefited the entire population
of Aceh, Nias and other district of North Sumatra. The good quality of the works and the
proper designs and construction supervision granted Aceh ahead of reconstruction to
move steps forward towards development. The true success of IRFF allowed it to be used
as template to develop other emergency response and reconstruction projects. The
national staff who promoted the BRR used their developed skills and knowledge to deal
with other subsequent disaster in Indonesia like Padang and in other parts of the world
like Haiti which has benefited from Aceh reconstruction and recovery experience.

Finally the seminar highlighted that asset transfer and management were identified as key
factors to sustain the IRFF project outcome. This has been safeguarded through the
transfer of the assets to the respective responsible agencies at the central, provincial and
local government levels. It is important that all of these agencies would allocate
appropriate budget to continue such valuable assets and maximize the utilization benefit.

III. EVALUATION AND LEARNING (LESSON LEARN) FOR THE FUTURE

3.1 PMU INSTITUTION.

PMU IRFF AF duty was to assist managing MDF / WB grants from August 2010 -
December 31, 2012 with a total funding of USD 36.7 million. The funds were used to
finance the program components including 3 packages of road reconstruction project of
50 km Calang - Meulaboh National Road and reconstruction of one (1) new bridge at
Kuala Bubon; one (1) Construction Supervision Consultant (CSC); Individual Consultant
(six contracts); and Incremental Operation Cost and Supporting staff to assist the PMU
IRFF-AF operational activity coordinated under Balai BBPJN 1 Medan. From the above
information, it is clear that the role of the PMU were very important. Besides acting as
Government of Indonesia representatives to the World Bank, the PMU also acted as a
Grant Management representative to SKPD / PPK and as actively liaising with Bappenas,
Aceh Provincial Government and the Ministry of Finance in issues related to IRFF-AF
projects. The World Bank supported the PMU to carry out these tasks by allocating
adequate resources to the PMU under the Incremental Operating Cost (IOC) category.
We recommend in order to facilitate the PMU duties, the stake holders to set up PMU
IRFF-AF mainly Directorate General of Highway (DGH), Regional office for Road
Implementation (Balai 1)Medan and the World Bank should discuss about readiness of
human resources and current facility of the nominated institution to determine the very
efficient location for PMU office base. To run the PMU IRFF AF, together with other
PMU for all foreign donors in entire Indonesia from headquarter of DGH in Jakarta is
the best option since DGH had experienced almost 30 years to operate management of
PMU. However, for practical reason the PMU was established in Medan to be closer to
all project and activities in Meulaboh. However, lack of human resources in Balai 1 in
Medan as a unit to facilitate Management of PMU, had affected smooth functions of
PMU. Finally any payment which experience delayed all resolved before closing date
December 31, 2012 thanks to Balai for their extra effort.




3.2 Procurement



                                          45
3.2.1 Procurement of Civil Works,
a. Preparation of Contract Documents
On The World Bank requested to review the accuracy and quality of the initial design of
package JNB 1, JNB2, JNB 3 and JNB 4. The consultancy firm, SMEC, has been
appointed to carry out the task. Herein the delay occurs due to completion process of
design review for the four packages to preparation of bidding document spent quite a
long time almost 6 months. As a result, the bidding schedule for physical packages was
delayed and the construction period was shortened in order not to exceed the closing date.
We recommend that the Bank did not push to review the existing design, as it surely will
consume a long time. So it delayed the physical works procurement schedule and
shortened the construction period. Though to ensure the accuracy of the design,
specification document define that the review can be carried out in the first 2 months of
mobilization period, after contract signing which is usually called as field engineering
review.
b. Procurement of Civil Works package
Tendering process for the four physical packages of JNB 1, JNB2, JNB3 and JNB 4
required a very long time because of different perception that requires back and forth in
discussion of the bid evaluation (Bid Evaluation Report-BER) between the Tender
Committee, PMU, BBPJN 1 and World Bank. The Procurement Specialist, at that time,
had not been appointed yet since the grant became effective just on August 18, 2011. In
addition to the different perceptions about the proposed BER, delay in approval from the
Bank also due to the polemic of the existence of the lowest bidder that has already
declared bankrupt by the High Court and the Supreme Court (PT Istaka Karya), but the
bankruptcy claim could not be accepted by the Bank since no formal statement was
available to the procurement committee be provided to the Bank.
We recommend that the committee who has a very well knowledge on the provisions of
Presidential Regulation 54 is also required to have a Bank guidelines knowledge before
the procurement process started, especially in the preparation of tender documents to
avoid prolonged different perception with the Bank, because according to the Grant
Agreement, the Indonesian government are obliged to follow the rules of the Bank
guideline. To mitigate for such delay, the role of procurement specialist, should have
been appointed as early as possible.
We also recommend that the Bank could directly accept the proposal of the Committee
for the disqualification of PT. Istaka Karya, which has been set for bankruptcy to avoid
wasting the time.
c. Procurement of Individual Consultant (IC)
This was conducted by a the Tender Committee following the Presidential Regulation 54
which led to tremendous delays, due to 4 times re-tendering which almost failed. These
failures are very time-consuming and reprimanded by the Bank. And based on World



                                           46
Bank procurement advice, the IC appointment can be implemented by simple selection of
one from three candidates.
We recommend that the committee in Balai would not force the implementation of
Presidential Decree no. 54 and ignore the Bank Guideline in the procurement process of
individual consultants (IC), as it will only wasting lots of time. The Committee should
understand that all fund providers are always setting their own rules and would not be
obliged to follow the government of Indonesia rules. For that the Committee would need
to harmonize methods in Presidential Decree no 54 with the Bank Guidelines.
3.2.2 Construction Supervision Consultant (CSC)
Procurement of CSC also has been delayed since the number of qualified consultant in
the shortlist were less than six firms (only five firms), which require additional time to
complete it.
We recommend the Banks to be able to give leeway and not refuse to prepare a shortlist
of just 5 consultants as proposed by the committee, given the urgent need for CSC and
the limited time.
3.2.3 Procurement of car for PMU
PMU should have been able to use the car since January 2012. However, due to a mistake
in DIPA (Grant was misquoted as Loan), the car bidding process for the PMU started in
May 2012 after correcting the DIPA and the car was procured on July 1, 2012.
We recommend that Balai and DGH would have to process the DIPA carefully so there
would be no misquotes which resulted in unnecessary delay due to the ratification of
DIPA for PMU car rental.
3.2.4. External Audit for IREP / IRFF.
With the letter from the World Bank about the method of simplified procurement of
External Auditor (Single Source Selection) on April 9, 2012, the implementation of
External Audit of IRFF / IREP project should have been carried out by Kanaka Firm in
May 2012. However, since the Tender Committee seemed to have difficulty in getting the
old contract from PMU RRI as a reference for the Committee in Balai for the
procurement of External Audit, the contract for Kanaka has been delayed for 5 months
and was concluded on September 20, 2012. The audit was completed on November 7,
2012.
We recommend that PMU RRI which has a complete data of IRFF and IREP projects
could provide reference data quickly, and avoided any long bureaucratic procedure, so
that the procurement and implementation of External Audit could have been conducted
much faster.
3.3 Program Management (PM)
Considering the task of Program Management Advisor (PMA) is responsible for
coordinating all program management for the PMU such as MDF Grant Extension


                                           47
Process, preparation of addenda for all contracts (physical civil works, CSC and IC),
preparation of quarterly reports for Bappenas, coordination with the PMU RRI about
previous IRFF and IREP projects, preparation for workshops, etc., then the assignment of
PMA should have enough budget to cover the frequent travel.
We recommend not to limit the number of official travel for PMA.


3.4 Quality Assurance Advisor (QAA).
QAA is responsible in providing technical advice particularly on the quality of the
implementation work in the field.
We recommend to strengthen function of QAA during civil works implementation by more
intense monitoring evaluation on the site, to meet the needs of monitoring and reporting
for the World Bank. Moreover, PMU was in the opinion that verification of quality needs
to be done by the PMU. That is conducted occasionally by random test through
independent Laboratory. Therefore the frequency of QAA trips to field should not be
restricted as stated in the contract only.
3.4.1 Problems on Physical Design and Implementation in the field
1. Design Constrain.
With the existence of P2JN design which was reviewed again by SMEC, and has been
approved by The World Bank after entering the contract period there should be no more
obstacles in design. However in reality, the existing designs still require a lot of
improvement as a reference during execution. Thus it still needs double check in the form
of field engineering review by the supervision consultant. With the addition of this
activity practically the physical implementation was delayed.
We recommend that the World Bank should have not forced to review the design that has
been completed by P2JN, because it will take a long time and will postpone the bidding
schedule. It is understood that the original design still need to be reviewed to get
accurate results until the contractor can start the work. However, in Indonesia to ensure
the accuracy of the design, the contractors and the consultants would review the design
again at mobilization time (2 months). Thus, time wasted on design review before the
contract can be transferred to the mobilization period after contract.
2. Technical Constrain on the field.
There are so many potential technical constraints which have caused the delay of field
activities such as lack of Dump Truck for transporting the raw materials, constraints of
materials stock in quarry, aggregate production of Class A and Class B that do not meet
the needs, delays of drainage works and structures, delays in supply of raw material for
stone crusher in producing aggregate class A and class B, hot mix overlay delays,
unevenness in the AC overlay, consolidation /sinking of the road on swamp area
inaccurate method causing failure of the first pier 2 erection of Kuala Bubon Bridge etc..



                                           48
We recommend that contractors (moreover as joint venture Company) ought to be able to
overcome all the above technical constraints; moreover in the field there was a
professional CSC to address the issue of implementation. Indeed understood most of the
things mentioned above are internal problems of the contractor, so all these things
should be taken into account when contractors submitted their bids. Moreover the
contractor is known as a large qualified national contractor and was qualified to carry
out this MDF project.
3. Progress Delay
Physical work delays were caused by many factors (technical and non-technical) as
described above. The project suffered both physical and financial disbursement delays.
So the project could not be completed on November 30, 2012 (addendum 5 to the
construction contracts).
With the technical justification support, the World Bank approved the extension of the
contracts end dates to December 15, 2012.

Physical progress and financial disbursement status of all packages reached 100% on
December 15, 2012. Taking into account the above delays, it is not something new, as
most contractors are usually wasting time at the beginning of the project, and then race
at the end of the project.
PMU, Balai, DGH and the World Bank conducted periodic site visits and applied
pressure on the contractors to complete works in accordance with the revised work
schedules.

4. Different Opinions between the Consultant and the Contractor
Different opinion between the two entities technically is reasonable. However the
responsibility for technical decisions remains on the supervision consultant.
In accordance with the Task Concept, supervision consultant is highly responsible for the
technical quality of the work in the field based on the specifications. On the other hand
the PIU / PPK always tried to pursue the achievement of targets. This becomes
problematic if the PIU / PPK insisted with such a mindset.

Considering the supervision mechanisms in the field which is task concept that managed
by the supervising consultant, we recommend that the project intervention (PIU / PPK)
on the physical implementation should be limited. In connection with the efforts to
accelerate the progress, it would be better to leave it to the consultant by monitoring the
works on a regular basis either weekly or by periodic meeting conducted by the Balai.
The Satker is supposed just to coordinate working relationships on a regular basis more
intensely, as well as pay attention to social constraints in the community and to
coordinate with the local government.
5. Contractor Field Administration Problems:
Capabilities of the contractors’ human resources are limited in administrative area,
financial management, and implementation strategy to perform the project in field.
Through joint venture, the contractor is expected to have strengths and synergy to


                                            49
complete the project. But as contrary in reality the progress achievement is always
delayed and applications for disbursement of consultants were not prepared timely. The
project reported that there were no specialized personnel to handle administration of
payments on site. Therefore the payment process became slow, and consequently affected
the implementation progress. From all the above constrains, PMU suggests the following:
Contractors are expected to be honest about the lack of capable human resources who
meet the needs of personnel with technical skills like that, with no intention to interfere in
the internal problems of the contractors, we recommended to the contractors to appoint
such expertise.
3.5 Financial Management (FM), related to payment activity
During the project cycle of MDF IRFF-AF, we have experienced many problems that
affecting /delay payment to the service provider. Some of the constraints are as follows;
1. Problem on IRFF-AF DIPA, quoted as Loan instead of Grant; it took a long time (4
months) to be revise.

2. Payment Verification. No serious problems were encountered. However, based on the
PMU record, CSC did not verify their invoice for the month of September 2012. This is
probably due to CSC dissatisfaction as they had not yet received payments since
February 2012 or just because of negligence of the CSC and the PPK in verifying
invoices to the FM. However this situation has been reprimanded by the World Bank and
verification was eventually carried out by FM from PMU to the CSC invoice.
3. The payment process by PPK in Balai (Regional Office of the Implementation Road 1
Medan) was need times due to limited of human resources available to proceed IRFF-AF
expenditures. Consequently many payments for expenditures of PMU and Technical
Assistant experienced delayed.
Taking into account these constraints PMU recommends the following:
- The DIPA proposal process, starting from Balai in Medan and then forwarded to the
Directorate of Implementation of Region I and further submitted to the Director of
Planning should be considered carefully to reduce the possibility of minor or fatal error
as above.
- CSC to understands the obligation to verify against their proposed invoice. Absence of
verification will make it difficult for the GoI to process cash replenishment in the DIPA.
- In order to avoid delay for payments for CSC, IC, IOC and Supporting Staff; PMU
should have its own PPK and officials who would not involve with other non IRFF-AF
duties in Balai but be designated to the Head of Balai.
3.6 Social Safeguard (SS)
1. Social issues of land compensation claims during construction period.




                                             50
Some parts of the earlier Calang-Meulaboh road, which were located near the beach,
were wiped out after the tsunami on December 24, 2004. Therefore, in 2005-2007, with
funding from JICA (from Japan) these national roads have been rebuilt. The construction
is carried out in a new different location and away from the beach with a pavement width
of 4.0 m. During disaster response period, the community has allowed the land to be used
for the construction of the road. Furthermore, through the IRFF AF, the road widening
affected the 4 packages of JNB1, JNB2, JNB3, and JNB 4 for about 50 km long. Through
socialization conducted by Aceh government (provincial and district of West Aceh), it is
known that the compensation has been completed all in 2010-2011.
Therefore, the construction of packages JNB1, JNB 2, JNB 3 and JNB 4 started in mid-
August 2011. In November 2011, however, the community stated that some road sections
especially those associated with JNB1 have not been released. According to the
community, they donated the land for the road only to the width of 6m. However, the
Aceh Barat district government requested to acquire the right of way of 15 m (4.5m - 6m
- 4.5m). Aceh Provincial Government responded promptly and cooperatively and
allocated the budget to pay for land compensation. Aceh Barat district government was
active in the implementation of the compensation procedure. As a result of this strong
support, implementation of land acquisition was performed smoothly and without
obstacles. In some areas, community allowed the construction but complained that they
have not received compensation payments yet from the government of Aceh. At the end
of the project period, there was still one parcel out of the total of 1398 land parcels,
which remained unresolved for the future right of way but technically it did not disturb
the road functioning space.
The socialization of land acquisition projects should have been implemented during the
planning phase in 2009 so there would be no more interference from the community
during implementation period of the physical contract. However, because of limited time
of the grant from the MDF which is only up to December 31, 2012 the process was
rushed. It is really challenging to note that the project was 100% completed without any
record of land acquisition cases left. We should be grateful and thankful to all those who
have been involved and helped over the years.
2. The social field problem occurs when the communities in some locations asked for
involvement in physical implementation in the field, such as: materials supplier,
construction labor, digging ditches, and stone masonry. Considering the field work is
always demanding on technical specifications and must fulfill a satisfactory quality, as
well as for reasons of the limitation of level of knowledge and expertise of local workers,
and for reasons of supervisory responsibility that was on supervision consultant, then
sometimes it is difficult to fulfill the community expectations.
Preferably public demands as in the case above can be solved with the socio-economic
approach through direct meetings as well as provide the opportunity for local people to
get involved in work, as well as skills training for local construction workers, in order to
get the benefits of the knowledge, experience and increased revenue during construction
period, or should be substituted by providing compensation and make facilities as needed
rather than always follows the community wishes.




                                            51
3. Social problems related to change of design from Pipe Culvert to Box Culvert. In some
locations, the community requested a change of construction design, which would affect
the cost, time and method of work. Socialization and explanation is needed in order to
minimize the problems.

Preferably, facing people's demands to change the design, PIU and PPK need to
socialize them by intensive technical understanding so the community becomes more
aware of the purpose and importance of the design that has been set.


3.7. Environmental Safeguards.
1. CEAP implementation has been delayed compared to the physical progress. This is due
to the recruitment and mobilization of contractor’s environmental specialist that are
intermittent, and difficulties in coordination between the contractor general
superintendent, supervision consultants and contractor’s environmental specialist.
Therefore it’s necessary to strengthen both environmental teams on contractor and
supervision consultant side.
2. As a result of unfamiliarity in the method of planting shade trees, many of the newly
trees died.
a. Preferably in the future, the presence of a contractor’s environmental specialist should
always be in the field (not intermittent), to facilitate coordination among all
environmental specialist in the field.
b. Provide training on method of tree planting and subsequent maintenance.


IV. ASSESSMENT OF THE WORLD BANK

4.1 WORLD BANK PERFORMANCES

Government of Indonesia and People of Aceh are very proud to have the great
infrastructure the National Road Calang-Meulaboh in western coast of Aceh. They are
highly appreciate to MDF and the World Bank who had greatest contribution to realize
and make this infrastructure present in Aceh.

Some of the Bank's performance that was very helpful in implementing IRFF AF:

1. The World Bank has always demonstrated highly initiative to support the
implementation of IRFF-AF, one of which is to provide IOC fund for the operational
facilities of PMU, when PMU IRFF-AF was approved in 2010.

2. The World Bank supported the PMU request related to the extension of the grant
closing date of IRFF AF (TF 098082) for 6 months from June 31, 2012 to December 31,
2012 even before the proposal processed by GOI.


                                            52
3. The World Bank has always quickly processed all the requests from PMU including
NOL approval for the amended project of civil works, designs review, extension of time,
increased costs and so on.

4. The World Bank has always encouraged all parties to immediately accelerate the
project completion and absorption of MDF funds as much as possible until to the closing
date, so that GoI would not struggle to find new funding source to complete the
remaining works.

5. The Bank contributed in accelerating project through its wide communication with
Government of Aceh. We noted completion of process of LARAP was successful due to
Bank support through some lobbying to Government of Aceh as well.

6. The World Bank were known to be very open for discussion, to provide support to the
PMU, both in official mission field visit, or via audio conference or during PMU visit to
WB office in Jakarta.

Some of the Bank's performance which was recorded for further improvement:
1. The World Bank should not impose to review the design which has been completed by
P2JN, because it will take a long time (6 months) and postpone the bidding schedule.
Subsequent risks, in order not to pass through closing date schedule that has not changed,
then the construction period should be shortened. It is understood that the original design
still need to be reviewed to get accurate results so that contractors can work right away.
However the common practice in Indonesia, to ensure the accuracy of the design, the
contractor and the consultant will review the original design again during mobilization
period (2 months). So the time wasted for design review prior to the contract can be
displaced to the mobilization period and the construction period would not be shortened.
2. We recommend in the approval process of prior review, the Bank does not impose the
committee to seek official data on the lowest contractor who has been declared bankrupt
by the High Court, because the data is not yet published. This situation resulted in
suspending the Bank NOL’s decision, so it is also a lot of wasted time.
3. Banks should be able to give leeway and not refuse to evaluate five consultants only as
proposed by the committee given the urgent need and the limited time available for the
CSC services.
4. The World Bank should be willing to give leeway for funding period, especially for
PMU operations and staff after closing date on December 31, 2012. It is required since
the PMU has many remaining work for 1-2 months thereafter. Moreover, PMU consider
it is possible due to MDF closing accounts will be ended in April 2013

    Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders


MDF Secretariat comments are provided below

These comments were prepared by the Secretariat of the Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and
Nias (MDF) and do not necessarily represent the views of the MDF Steering Committee
or donors. IRFF was one of the MDF’s 23 projects for post-disaster recovery in Aceh
and Nias. The MDF provided a grant of US$ 100 million in total for IRFF and an
additional US$ 36.7 million for the IRFF Additional Financing (AF), making IRFF the
largest single project in the MDF portfolio.
The MDF was established to support the implementation of the Government of
Indonesia’s (GOI’s) rehabilitation and reconstruction program after the December 2004
tsunami and subsequent March 2005 earthquake. At the request of the government, the
World Bank serves as the trustee to administer the MDF which is in turn governed by a
Steering Committee comprised of donors, GOI, and civil society representatives, with the
United Nations and international non-governmental organizations participating as
observers. The donors contributing to the MDF are: the European Union, the
Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the World Bank, Sweden, Canada, Denmark, Norway,
Germany, the Asian Development Bank, the United States of America, Belgium, Finland,
New Zealand and Ireland. The MDF pools about US$655 million in grant resources
provided by these 15 donors, an amount equivalent to about 10% of the overall
reconstruction efforts. The MDF provided grants for implementation of 23 projects in
five outcome areas: recovery of communities, recovery of large infrastructure and
transport, strengthening governance and capacity building, supporting sustainable
management of the environment, economic development and livelihoods, and providing
support to enhance the overall reconstruction process. The largest share, 35%, of the
MDF’s resources was allocated to the large infrastructure and transport outcome area.
The IRFF project, together with the complementary Infrastructure Reconstruction
Enabling Project (IREP), were the key vehicles for financing large-scale reconstruction of
infrastructure in Aceh and Nias and were thus strategically important to the MDF’s
overall reconstruction program.
Total IRFF project completed in Aceh and Nias was 56 sub projects which consisted of 5
ports (4 packages), 11 water supply and water resources projects (including coastal
protection), 11 national roads (including a bridge), 9 provincial roads (2 in Nias), and 21
district roads.
For the IRFF project, the GoI had co-financed about $108.9 million through the Agency
for the Reconstruction and Rehabilitation of Aceh and Nias (Badan Rekonstruksi dan
Rehabilitasi Aceh dan Nias) widely known as the BRR. As the BRR was coming to the
end of its mandate, disbursement of the government co-financing before its closure
became a significant issue. Slow project implementation and disbursements became a
source of extreme frustration for the BRR. The Bank and the MDF agreed on an
innovative approach to resolve the issue, whereby the disbursement of BRR funds was
front loaded to complete disbursements before the BRR closing date. The MDF


                                            55
financing of the IRFF was put on hold, and resumed once the BRR funds had been fully
disbursed. The Secretariat engaged with all the donors on this phased disbursement plan,
and donors were fully supportive as well. This approach helped to resolve a key issue
and to support the needs of a well performing client.
IRFF AF (Additional Financing) was an extension of the original IRFF project and was
the final major project investment approved by the MDF Steering Committee. The
government requested the MDF to extend the road on the west coast of Aceh that had
been built by USAID between Banda Aceh and Calang, Aceh Jaya. IRFF AF completed
the 49 km extension and an 800 meter bridge between Calang and Meulaboh (Aceh
Barat). This segment of road was strategically important because it re-established a
critical link in the west coast corridor, thus providing multiplier effects and providing
impact and benefits for the entire region.
Implementation time for completing this project was a serious concern for the MDF and
required the attention and support of all stakeholders (central and provincial government,
the World Bank, donors, and the MDF Secretariat) to ensure that the project could be
completed on schedule. The government’s performance in the preparation phase of the
IRFF AF project was very slow in terms of decision making on choice of investments and
the institutional arrangements, creating serious delays in implementation. In fact, there
was concern that the project would have to be cancelled due to insufficient time
remaining for implementing the project before the expiration of the MDF’s mandate on
December 31, 2012.
However, once the institutional arrangements were in place and the project was under
way, the government managed to implement and bring the project to completion in a very
short time, finishing just before the MDF program closed. A number of factors
contributed to this, including strong supervision by the Bank and a good model of
cooperation between the provincial and national-level Department of Public Works. The
decision to split the project up into several contract packages also allowed the project to
implement more quickly, with contracts moving in parallel, than it could have had it been
a single package.
The project had a number of innovations that contributed to the good results: (1) The
IRFF AF project structure had strongly engaged provincial and district governments from
the very beginning of implementation. The Project Management team (Satker) for
physical work was appointed from Provincial Department of Public Works core staff and
based in Aceh. They worked in close collaboration with PMU at Sumatra regional office
in Medan. Strong coordination with provincial and local governments removed some
implementation challenges particularly related to land acquisition issues. (2) Contractor’s
Environmental Action Plan (CEAP). The CEAP was taken up by the GoI as a best
practice mechanism for infrastructure projects under its own funding. Land acquisition
issues for road building in Aceh following the tsunami presented challenges, but the local
government in the case of IRFF-AF provided good leadership in resolving these issues.
The completion of the 49 km road and a bridge between Calang and Meulaboh by the
project end date is an excellent result, despite the land issues that the project faced during



                                             56
implementation. This road has impact beyond the MDF financing in providing a strategic
connection on the west coast with multiplier effects on transportation along this corridor.
IRFF AF project demonstrated a good example of the World Bank and Ministry of Public
Works (MoPW) team collaboration in reconstructing the 49 km national road and one
bridge and allocating sufficient budget for the operations and maintenance of the roads in
Aceh and Nias. The commitment of the central and provincial government in allocating
the O&M budget will ensure the sustainability of the assets (road, ports, and bridges) that
MDF supported. This commitment has been demonstrated through the completion of
some of the “gaps? program projects under the initial IRFF by the local government after
the first phase of IRFF closed.
The project is successful due to mainly the strong support and contribution from the
central and provincial government in particular in the area of land issues which are
always significant on road expansion or extension projects. The settlement on land
compensation, involving more than 2,000 cases, has contributed significantly to the
completion of the project by closure date. Besides land, delays in equipment
mobilization and shortages of experienced workers from the local area were equally
important issues which were addressed by the project.
The implementation setting in Aceh and Nias was extremely challenging, following both
a devastating natural disaster and 30 years of conflict, as well as extreme isolation and
neglect in the case of Nias. The MDF played an important role in the success of IRFF
and other MDF projects through its implementation support. The additional support for
supervision provided by the MDF allowed the Bank team to provide the continuous and
on-sight implementation support and supervision that such a large and diverse project
operating in these challenging circumstances required in order to be successful.
