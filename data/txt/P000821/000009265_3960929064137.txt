MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE GAMBIA
FOR AN EDUCATION SECTOR CREDIT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to The Gambia for SDR 11.3 million (US$14.6 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 :ears and would halp finance an
education sector project. The project would be cofinanced by the European
Economic Community in the amount of US$3.0 million equivalent.
2.        Background.   The Government presently spends about 20? of its
budget on education, but the impact of these expenditures on economic and
social development is weakened by inefficient resource use and structural
deficiencies in the education system. The main issues in education are:
(a) low and inequitable access to primary education; (b) low internal
efficiency and poor quality of primary educaticn- (c) inappropriate
structure of secondary education; and (d) budgetary constraints. The 1988
primary enrollment ratio (57Z) is well below the average for Sub-Saharan
Africa (77Z) and hides marked disparities in access ty region and for girls
(39Z of primary pupils are girls). Repetition and dropout rates are high
(19 and 30?, respectively), and the quality of primary education is poor.
Improvements in access to primary schooling are constrained by declining
expenditures in real terms, and by the inefficient use of teachers and
facilities. Factors which contribute to qualitative problems includez a
large number of unqualified teachers (542), inadequate supplies of
textbooks and teaching materials, poor physical facilities, and an
ineffective examinations system. At secondary level, the structure,
content, and quality of secondary technical edt.cation are inappropriate as
these schools provide students with neither practical skills for
employment, nor good academic instruction in preparation for further
education. The low-quality of technical education is a result of serious
underfunding and a lack of qualified teachers, textbooks and training
equipment. With respect to budgetary constraints, education's share of the
Government's budget declined from 19? in 1984/85 to 17.8? in 1988/89; the
*          current level of 20.5? is largely a result of recently increased teachers'
salaries. Primary education has been particularly affected by budgetary
constraints; its share of the MOE budget declined from 47? in 1984/85 to
*          38? in 1989/90.  Furthermore, unit costs are high at all levels of
education, mainly as a result of small class sizes and low pupil/teacher
ratios (in 1989, the pupil/teacher ratio in primary education in The Gambia
was about 30:l, compared to an average of 42s1 for Sub-Saharan Africa).
3.        To address these issues, the Gambian Parliament approved an
Education Policy in June 1988, after extensive consultations in The Gambia
and with the donor community, including IDA. The objectives of the
Education Policy are to expand access to and improve the quality of
education; restructure secondary education; improve the quality and
relevance of skills training; expand the role of the private sector in
education; and improve the management of the sector's limited financial and
human resources.



- 2 -
4.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Government authorities and the
Bank recogn$Le the low level of human resources development in The Gambia
as the single greatest constraint to economic growth and identify the high
rate of population growth (3.52 per annum), the inadequate level of basic
education, and the limited access to and poor quality of health care as the
anderlying causes. With respect to the education sector, the Bank's
strategy essentially consists of assisting the Government In Implementing
its recently approved Education Policy for the period 1988-2003 developed
with Bank support over the last few years. The proposed project will
support the first phase program which focuses on issues of quality and
access in primary education, relevance of secondary education, and improved
cost-effectiveness and management across the sector.
5.        Proiect Ob1ectives.  The principal objective of the proposed
project is to increase access to and improve the quality and efficiency of
education in a sustainable, cost-effective manner. The project would
assist the Government in implementing a specific investment program,
supported by major reforms in sectoral policies and programs which have
been approved by the Gambian Cabinet and Parliament. Specifically, the
project would: (a) expand and improve the quality of primary education,
including an increase in the primary school enrollment ratio from the
current 57Z to 702 by 1996/97; (b) restructure and improve the quality of
secondary education by introducing a new secondary education system of two
three-year cycles and by phasing out secondary technical schools;
(c) strengthen the skills training programs; and (d) reinforce the planning
and management capacities of key sector institutions.
6.        Proiect Description.  The package of policy measures supported
by the project aims to: (a) improve efficiency and effectiveness in the
use of sector resources; (b) promote the development of private initiatives
in education; (c) increase opportunities for the enrollment of girls; and
(d) improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of the secondary education
system. Actions agreed to these effects are reflected in paragraph 8
below. The investment program would finance investments to support:
(a) expansion and improvement in the quality of primary education through
the construction of 600 new class-ooms and the renovation of 200 existing
classrooms; revision of curricula and provision of about 400,000 textbooks
and teachers' guides; and provision of training for 1,200 unqualified
primary school teachers currently employed in the system, and for 100 new
teachers each year; (b) restructuring and improvement in the quality of
secondary education by converting 17 existing technical secondary schools
into lower secondary institutions equipped with improved science teaching
facilities; updating curricula; and providing 100,000 textbooks and
teachers' guides; (c) strengthening of skills training prog.ams through
improvements in program content and training facilities at the Gambia
Technical Training Institute (GTTI) and the Banjul Vocational Training
Center; and (d) reinforcement of the Ministry of Education through
developing its educational planning and management capacities, as well as
its capacity to implement projects; and reorganizing the national
examination system.
7.        The project, to be carried out over a period of six years,
provides funds for civil works; textbooks and instructional materials;



-3-
vehicles, furniture and equipment; specialist services and fellowships;
incremental operating costs; and pre-investment studies. The total cost of
the project is estimated at US$21.2 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$13.0 million equivalent (61Z). A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts znd methods
of procurement, the allocation of the IDA Credit and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Annex B. A timetable of key project processing
events is given at Schedule C, and the status of Bank Group operations in
The Gambia is given at Schedule D. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 8359-GK dated April 30, 1990, is also attached.
8.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed that it would (a)
introduce measures to increase studentiteacher ratios: (b) submit proposals
to increase user fees in secondary schools and introduce training levies in
vocational training; (c) develop specific criteria for assistance to
madarassas (schools which provide Islamic and general education in Arabic);
td) implement an action program for improving female enrollment and
achievement; (e) restructure secondary education and apply corresponding
budgetary adjustments; (f) conduct joint annual implementation reviews of
policy measures and work programs and a formal joint mid-term review of
project implementationt (g) recruit volunteers to assist with self-help
school construction programs; (h) establish and operate a revolving fund
for the collection and use cf user fees for textbooks; (i) apply changes in
the management and operation of vocational training; and (j) introduce new
primary and secondary school examinations. As conditions of effectiveness,
the Government would (a) submit detailed plans for introducing multi-grade
and double-shift teaching; (b) set up two mobile construction teams to
initiate the self-help school construction program; (c) approve regulations
to establish salaries for primary teachers who have completed approved in-
service teacher training programs; and (d) appoint a deputy director of the
Project Implementation Unit.
9.        Benefits.  Approximately 38,000 children who would otherwise not
gain access to primary schools will be able to do so as a result of project
investments and the more effective use of available resources. The primary
enrollment ratio is expected to increase from its present level of 57Z to
701 by 1996/97. Expanded coverage of the system would benefit more
children in rural areas and particularly girls.  Furthermore, teacher
training programs and provision of textbooks and teachers' guides to be
supported by the project will help lay the groundwork for the development
of a high quality and relevant educational system at both the primary and
secondary levels. With regard to the restructuring of secondary education,
access to good-quality lower-second'ry schools would be increased, while
structural changes in vocational education and revi3ions in program content
would make the system more responsive to manpower needs and enhance the
skill levels of workers and technicians.
10.       Risks.  The main risks are:  Ci) Government's ability to
implement a project involving major educational policy reforms and a large
school construction program; (ii) budgetary constraints which could
restrict adequate coverage of recurrent costs to be incurred in meeting
targets set by the reform program; and (iii) communities' commitment and
ability to participate in classroom construction. The first risk is
mitigated by the fact that a general consensus has been reached in The



- 4 -
Gambia with respect to education reforms supported under the project,
culminating in Parliament's debate and approval of these reforms. The risk
is further reduced by measures under the project aiming to strengthen the
capacities of the Ministry of Education (MOE), including training and
technical assistance. The possible impact of the second risk is reduced by
Government's agreement on specific measures to increati the allocation for
education, particularly primary education, in the Government budget. This
commitment will be monitored in the context of annual expenditure reviews.
Finally, as concerns community participation in school construction,
regional mobile construction teams, reinforced by construction supervision
staff and community development specialists, will provide assistance to and
supervision of construction activities.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed czedit.
