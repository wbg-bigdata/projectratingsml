IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
HIGHWAY SECTOR LOAN (LOAN 2963-UNI)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Highway Sector Loan in
Nigeria, for which Loan 2963-INI in the amount of US$ 250 million was approved on June 16,
1988, and made effective on March 30, 1990.
The loan was closed on June 30, 1997, after six extensions from the original closing date of
June 30, 1993. The final disbursement took place on December 29, 1997, at which time a balance
of US$18.3 was canceled. Previous cancellations amounted to US$50 million on January 1, 1993,
and US$40 million on December 31, 1996.
The ICR was prepared by Dieter Schelling, TWUTD, Finance, Infrastructure and Private
Sector Development, Farida Khan, Operations Analyst, AFTT2, and Eng. Okwudili Ikejiani,
Consultant, and was reviewed by Mr. Yaw Ansu, Country Director for Nigeria.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision/completion mission in
June 1997. A final site visit to all the major construction sites was made in July 1997 in order to
assess actual stage of completion and to collect traffic data required for the final economic
evaluation. Materials from the Borrower's PMU and the Bank's project file were also used to
establish this report. The Borrower was sent a draft of this report in early October 1997, but failed to
comment and to provide its own contribution.
The Bank wishes to recognize that the Borrower's  staff entrusted with project
implementation faced considerable adversity.  Obstacles beyond the control of the implementing
staff were macroeconomic instability which led to a sharp decline in their real income, civil unrest
related to changes of Govemment, severe shortages of bitumen and fuel since 1994, the
misappropriation of,the special account by the client's banker which halted the project for one year
and which almost led to its cancellation, periodic telecommunications and power interruptions and
an abrupt move of the entire Ministry to Abuja during the final year of the project.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
HIGHWAY SECTOR LOAN (LOAN 2963-UNI)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
i.    Introduction. The Government of Nigeria requested the Bank's assistance in financing a
part of the 1989-1991 Federal Highway Program that was to be administered by the Federal
Highway Department (FHD), a central government agency responsible for all federal highways.
The program emphasized rehabilitation, strengthening and maintenance of existing highways,
combined with a set of measures to improve the overall efficiency of the sector.
ii.    Bank support of the FHD Program  was to help the government to implement a
coherent strategy covering a realistic package of policy measures, institutional developments and
sector expenditures based on agreed objectives and annual reviews that were to address FHD's
principle operational and institutional weaknesses. The program was expected to increase the
cost effectiveness of FHD's operations. The relatively quick disbursing nature of the loan was to
provide rapid assistance to the government in alleviating its acute foreign exchange shortage.
iii.   Bank's Role in the Sector. Prior to this loan, the Bank had supported seven projects in
the highway sector, which all suffered from implementation delays and lack of success of the
institutional development component.
iv.   Project Objectives and Components. The project objectives were: (a) to protect
existing road assets with a realistic rehabilitation program tailored to available resources; (b) to
carry out an appropriate and sustainable road maintenance program; (c) to improve operational
efficiency and cost effectiveness through better contracting and design practices; and (d) to
improve road safety. It included the following four components: (i) road improvements; (ii)
road maintenance; (iii) road safety; and (iv) institutional development.
v.    Loan Covenants and Special Agreements. Project objectives were reinforced by
covenants concerning project and transport sector finance, and a requirement of an annual
exchange of views by FHD and the Bank on the program.
vi.   Evaluation of Project Objectives and Covenants.  The project concept and its
objectives were clear and consistent with the Highway Sector Programn. The Loan covenants
seem, in hindsight, highly unrealistic. Achievements of the set financial targets were far below
target and were declining throughout the project implementation period.

IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS
vii.   Assessment of Project's Success and Sustainability. The project's physical objectives
were, after long delays, partially achieved, but the institutional development impact was
negligible.
viii. Summary of Costs and Financing Arrangements: Final disbursement from the Loan
Account amounted to US$141.7 million.  As per the Loan Agreement, the counterpart
contribution from the government was to be 25% of the project cost. Total counterpart
contribution amounts to Naira 879 million or 23.7% of the total project cost, applying historic
exchange.rates.
ix.   Implementation Schedule: Due to the delays experienced up to effectiveness of the
loan and delays in implementation, the actual project implementation period was March 1990 to
June 1997, or six years and ten months during which only about 50% of the physical objectives
were achieved.
x.   Analysis of Key Factors Affecting Major Objectives: There was a chronic shortage of
bitumen in the country with grave consequences for the project due to the government's policies
that frustrated domestic production and also its refusal to allow importation. The artificial
pegging of the exchange rate made project management difficult and led to the misuse of the
Special Account by the Ministry's banker. Political turmoil and frequent change of key project
personnel contributed to implementation delays.
xi.   Assessment of the Borrower's and Bank's Performance: The performance of the
borrower was less than satisfactory in the preparation and implementation of the project. The
Bank's performance was less than satisfactory in preparation and appraisal because unrealistic
assumptions were made regarding the capacity of FMWH to execute the project. Overall, the
Bank's performance during supervision was satisfactory. Towards the end of the project,
extensions of the Loan closing date were granted on a six monthly basis with the hope that the
borrower would in,prove its performance. However, such improved performance failed to
materialize.
xii.   Assessment of Project's Outcome: The outcome of the project is judged as
unsatisfactory. While the road rehabilitation objectives have, after long delays, partly been
achieved, none of the other objectives regarding maintenance, road safety and institutional
development have been achieved.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND KEY LESSONS LEARNED
xiii  Important Findings of Project Implementation Experience:
a) Macroeconomic risks such as policies towards the supply and pricing of bitumen and the
declared self-sufficiency and consequent import restrictions of the government were not
sufficiently considered in the project design.
b) In parallel with the economic decline and political turmoil, an institutional decline was
experienced in the road sector in Nigeria with a particular severe impact on the project.
Furthermore, the institutional set up for road management in Nigeria is not viable. There are
too many agencies with weak capacity, with resulting political interference. Fundamental
restructuring is required to achieve sustainability.
xiv.  Key lessons learned from the project experience are summarized below:
a) Reliable supply of bitumen is crucial for the execution of a roads project. Hence any future
intervention in the road sector must call for the lifting of supply side restrictions on bitumen.
b) One of the most important lessons to be learnt from this project, as from many other road
projects in developing countries, is that in order to achieve sustainable finance of road
maintenance, the road users must be involved in the management of the roads. The road
users (transport operators etc.) have an interest in good roads and are willing to contribute, as
long as they have a say in the management of the funds.
c) A recent road reform initiative of the government, called Road Vision 2000, supported by the
Bank, aims at fundamental reform of road management in Nigeria. The Bank should continue
to support this initiative. Ownership for the reform must clearly be born by the Nigerian
stakeholders.
d) Possible future support by the Bank, once the reform process is showing results, could be in
the form of guarantees to private sector concessionaires for the management of highly
trafficked roads and investments in the recovery of the badly deteriorated road network.
Particular attention would have to be given to the rural road network, which will be required
for the recovery of the rural sector. Large portions of the required financing of the road
recovery program could be accrued from road users, if they are involved in the management
through the proposed National Roads Board.
e) Unless a fundamental reform of the management of the roads can be achieved with true
stakeholder ownership, the Bank should not finance further road projects, but should focus on
the promotion of the reform process.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
HIGHWAY SECTOR LOAN (LOAN 2963-UNI)
Part I - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
1.    INTRODUCTION
A.   Macroeconomic Setting
1.    The project period (1986-1997) witnessed numerous policy and political changes in
Nigeria that influenced the implementation context. Nigeria made a conscious but incomplete
attempt at structural adjustment during 1986-1993. In 1991, however, slippage in fiscal
discipline,and public resource management led to the withdrawal of Bank adjustment support.
Large fiscal deficits were recorded, and economic growth stagnated. GNP per capita declined
from US$1,180 in 1980 to US$260 in 1995. Income inequality increased, and 34 percent of the
population was classified as "poor." Basic social indicators now place Nigeria among the 20
poorest countries worldwide.
2.    In 1994 a new government chose to repress the symptoms of the mounting economic
crisis rather than to tackle its causes. But rapidly worsening economic conditions led
Government to re-assess its policies in early 1995. A new approach of "guided deregulation"
was instituted. Tight fiscal policies, a free market for foreign exchange, and the elimination of
many barriers to investment curtailed inflation and produced a small fiscal surplus. In 1996
Government continued this process of gradual liberalization, resulting in a small economic
rebound of 3.1 percent growth.
3.    Absence of a credible restructuring of federal expenditure priorities and of programs
necessary to produce a structural fiscal balance and a limited budgetary transparency and
accountability leave the sustainability of the macro-stabilization program initiated in 1995 in
doubt.
B.    Institutional Decline
4.    In parallel with the economic decline and political turmoil, an institutional decline was
experienced in the road sector in Nigeria with a particular severe impact on the project.
Following are some of the key contributing factors:
a) real wages of civil servants have decreased approximately by a factor of 10 (1986-1997).
The salary of a Director of Federal Highways is now US$96 per month equivalent and that of
a Deputy Director is US$77 per month equivalent, compared to US$1,000 per month and
US$ 800 per month equivalent respectively in 1986. The ratio with income of comparable
positions in the private sector is 1:25.



-2-
b) the civil service was critically undermined by the assumption by Ministers and Military
Administrators of the role of accounting officers, who approve even the smallest expenditure
of the Ministry or the State.
c) the position of the Principal Secretary as the head of the civil service of a ministry., who
formerly was mostly a very experienced technocrat, was replaced by a politically appcinted
Director General, who in most cases has little or no sector knowledge (the position of .h
principal secretary has just been reinstated in the 1998 budget).
d) as a result of political instability, the project suffered frequent change of key personnel.
Between 1990 and 1997, four Ministers, four Directors of Highways and five Deputy
Directors dealt with the project for various periods of time. Mid-level staff, including
engineer's representatives, principal engineers and other staff members important to the
execution of the project were shifted continuously.
e) with successive changes of top officers the decision making process within the Ministiy
became more cumbersome. Towards the end of the project an interim payment certificate of
a contractor required twenty five (25) different approvals before payment could be made.
5.    The effects of the above on the institutional capacity were drastic and can be summarized
as follows:
f)    low attractiveness of civil service employment which led to brain drain and low morale of
the remaining staff, which in turn led to:
i) slow decision making regarding all aspects of project implementation, in particular in
respect of procurement and payment to contractors and consultants.
ii) a tendency towards rent seeking behavior.
g)   the concentration of all final decision making at the ministerial level and the
consequential weakening of the civil service staff led to undue political influence on pure
technical matters. Expectedly, in this context, maintenance was neglected, since the highly
visible new construction or upgrading of roads carries more political gains than low-key'
maintenance.
C.   Bank's Role in the Transport Sector
6.    Prior to this project, from 1958 to 1994, the Bank disbursed US$293.2 million in eleven
transport sector operations, of which US$196.7 million (67%) was allocated to the roads and the
rest for the railway and ports sub-sectors. These investments tended to be patchy, partly related
to repair of damage suffered during the civil war, and were not based on an agreed transport
sector strategy resulting from a sector dialogue. They also suffered from implernentation delays
and lack of success of the institutional development components. As a consequence, the
Highway Sector Loan and the two on-going Multi-State Roads Projects were designed with
substantial technical assistance components with the objective of building up institutional



- 3 -
capacity. Furthermore, a Transport Parastatal Restructuring Project was implemented with the
aim of assisting the government's efforts to restructure transport parastatals, such as railways,
ports, airports, etc.
7.    A proposed Railway Restructuring Project and a Lagos Urban Transport Project prepared
in the early nineties, would have required major policy changes. However, both projects were
abandoned due to lack of progress regarding the necessary policy changes.
2.    PROJECT OBJECTIVES
A.   Original Project Objectives
8.    The project was designed to assist the FHD's 1989 - 91 program seeking to: (i) protect
existing assets with a realistic rehabilitation program tailored to available resources; (ii) carry
out an appropriate and sustainable road maintenance program; (iii) improve operational
efficiency and cost effectiveness through better contracting and design practices; and (iv)
improve road safety.
B.    Project Description and Components
9.    The Highway Sector Loan of US$250 million was to help implement the Govenment's
road program for the years 1989-91 amounting to a total of US$955 million. The project
included the following components:
a) Road improvement: sub-projects for strengthening, rehabilitation and new construction by
contract
b) Road maintenance: to provide routine maintenance on all federal roads (28,000 km) by
contract and force account
c) Road safety: to built up the capability of FHD through data collection and accident analyses,
and traffic safety courses, in order to identify and correct hazardous locations on the road
network
d) Institutional development: provision of consulting services to: (i) develop capacity and skills
in the FMWH's planning, maintenance and civil engineering divisions; (ii) assist FHD to
establish a data management system; (iii) define an axle load policy; (iv) supervise
construction and routine maintenance operations by contract; (v) begin a program of
continuing education for FHD engineers; (vi) determine the best way to implement works to
be done on state roads; and (vii) assist FHD with the scheduling and coordination of
consulting and construction contracts
C. Loan Covenants And Special Agreements
10.   Project objectives were reinforced by covenants concerning project and transport sector
finance, as follows:



-4 -
a) deposit of one quarter of the annual capital and recurrent budget allocations to FHD
into Project Accounts A and B respectively in each quarter.
b) allocation of 15% of the total federal capital expenditure to the transport sector
annually.
c) capital expenditure to federal highways to be a minimum of 80% of the transport
sector capital allocation annually.
d) recurrent expenditure allocation to cover annual routine maintenance requirement on
entire federal road network.
e) not later than January 1990 implement a system of road user chargps to recover at
least the recurrent cost of the federal highways.
Additionally, it was required to hold annual exchange of views by FHD and the Bank on the
program.
D. Evaluation of Project Objectives and Covenants
11.   The project objectives were clear and highly relevant to the sustenance of the federal road
network in Nigeria. This was particularly important in view of the huge investments made into
the Nigerian road system during the oil boom years (about US$7 billion equivalent) and in view
of the high traffic volumes encountered on the federal roads. Considering the impressive federal
road network constructed by the FHD, it was reasonable to assume sufficient capacity for the
execution of the road improvement component of the project. However, in view of the weak
record of the past Bank-fmanced projects regarding maintenance and institutional capacity
building components, a more thorough institutional analysis should have been carried out, and as
a result, the objectives should have focused more on the required institutional improvements.
12.   The Loan covenants, with the exception of the allocations for maintenance, were based on
past expenditure records, which, however, could not be pursued in the face of the worsening
economic crisis. The average annual allocation to the transport sector between 1990 and 1996
was about 10% of the total federal capital expenditure instead of the required 15%, and only an
average of 48% of this (instead of 80% as per the Loan covenant) went to the road sector.
13.  In view of the past performance and annual allocations, the covenants regarding
maintenance (paragraphs 10.d and 10.e above) were not very realistic. The annual maintenance
allocation for federal roads, rather underestimated at appraisal at about US$80 million equivalent
per annum, was an average of US$15 million equivalent per annum and dwindled down to the
equivalent of US$1.5 million, or US$54 per kilometer. Taking into account the bad and
worsening condition of the network, these amounts had to be mainly used for emergency
measures. The recommendations of the Road User Charges and Axle Load Study were never
implemented. The study showed that road user charges exceeded the recurrent maintenance
requirement, however, these amounts were not allocated to maintenance. In addition, if fuel
were priced economically even more revenue could be collected from road users.

3. IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS
A.   Assessment of Project's Success and Sustainability
A. 1   Road Improvement
14.   Advance Contracting: During a post-negotiation mission in April 1987 the Bank gave its
no-objection to the retro-active financing of 75% of the cost of 25 road works, including
rehabilitation and overlay of some road sections, and the construction of three bridges and short
road sections, procured prior to effectiveness of the Loan. All projects were visited by the
Project Management Unit (PMU) towards the end of 1991 and were found to have been executed
satisfactorily. A total of US$19,729,138 was spent on these projects from the Loan.
15.   First Year Rehabilitation Contracts: After effectiveness in March 1990 it took until
December 1991 to procure contracts for the design of the "first year" rehabilitation works.
Thirty-four (34) contracts were signed, of which 27 totaling 1,284 km of road designs were
completed. The Pavement Evaluation Unit (PEU) of the Ministry, created under the Sixth
Highway Project, prepared designs for some additional high priority roads. Between March
1993 and June 1994 eventually a number of 21 civil works contracts were awarded for an initial
total arnount of US$107 million and Naira 1 billion covering the rehabilitation of 1,515 km of
high priority roads. Due to inflation and variations orders, however, these amounts increased to
US$113 million and Naira 1.7 billion. Extended execution delays occurred due to the previously
described shortage of bitumen, political turbulence, and project management problems. At the
date of final disbursement US$139.7 million equivalent were paid out under these contracts and
675 kilometers of two lane roads were fully completed.
16.   Average per kilometer costs for the rehabilitation of the completed roads amounted to
US$78,000 equivalent. Quality of these roads is satisfactory and costs are moderate. Average
economic rate of return (ERR) of the completed road sections has been calculated at 87% using
the HDM-III model as against the initially assumed 65% ERR (see Table 8).
17.   Second Year Designs: In 1992 the PMU was requested by the Ministry to select a second
set of priority roads,for rehabilitation. In September 1994, the design of 45 road sections of a
total length of 1,961 km was commissioned. In May 1997, bidding documents for 30 sections
were finally presented, and the documents were handed over to the Federal Highway Department
for government financing or financing under a future loan.
18.   Bridge Construction: Some of the roads being rehabilitated lacked bridges or contained
substandard bridges. In January 1996, six contracts for the construction of 17 bridges were
awarded for a total amount of US$13 million equivalent. Of these, ten (10) bridges were
completed at the time of project closure, at the cost of US$9.2 million.
A.2   Road Maintenance
19.  In January 1994, the Ministry presented a five-year routine maintenance program by
contract. Initially the program planned to cover 3700 km of federal roads and by the year 1998 it



-6 -
would have expanded to the entire federal road network. By the end of 1994, 78 routine
maintenance contracts for a network of 3700 km and for an amount of Naira 187 million (Naira
50,000 or US$2,300 per km) were awarded. Only 54 out of the 78 contracts became active, the
other 24 were abandoned, and only Naira 66 million was spent on the program. Due to poor
performance of the contractors, all contracts were terminated in January 1996.
A.3   Road Safety:
20.   Proposals for the improvement of 10 hazardous sections of the federal road network were
prepared by the PMU and submitted to the Ministry for approval. No firther action was taken by
the Ministry.
A.4  Institutional Development:
21.   A contract to support the PMU to execute the project and to build up institutional
capacity within the Ministry was signed in May 1991 with an international consultant. Under
this contract a total of 298 man-months of international experts assisted PMU and a total of US$
5.5 million was spent. The technical assistance focused on the procurement and management of
the contracts financed under the Loan, but was unable to assist in building up capacity given the
institutional environment described in Chapter 1.B.
B.   Summary of Costs and Financing Arrangements
22.   The original Loan Agreement dated December 22, 1989 called for the Loan to finance
75% of all expenditures under categories 1 and 3 (civil works and consultants), and 100% of
foreign and 75% of local expenditures under category 2 (goods). Due to the difficulties the client
had to finance foreign exchange, the agreement was changed as of April 3, 1993 with the
following financing arrangements: 100% of foreign and 45% of local expenditures under
categories 1 and 3, and 100% of foreign and 75% of local expenditures under category 2.
23.   A Special Account was opened with a cornmercial bank in Lagos and an initial
authorized allocation of US$20 million was deposited on May 27, 1990. In November 1994, the
bank transferred an amount of US$ 4.5 million from the Special Account to the Project Account
at the then fixed official rate of Naira 22 to the US$. The bank was unable to provide a written
instruction from the Ministry for this transfer and claimed that instructions were received
verbally. It appeared that the bank in fact changed the money at the parallel market rate of Naira
80 to the US$ and deposited the equivalent of Naira 22 to the US$ into the Project Account.
24.   As a consequence, in July 1995, IBRD demanded the refund of the full amount of the
Special Account of US$5.4 million to the Loan Account. The incident led to the suspension of
the Loan in November 1995, and since the client's banker was unable or unwilling to reverse the
transfer, FMF had to assist by transferring the amount directly from the Central Bank to the Loan



-7 -
Account shortly before the set date for cancellation of the Loan in December 1995. As a result of
IBRD's refusal to replenish the Special Account before the above issue was settled, the project
came to a complete standstill during the entire 1995.
25.   Final disbursement from the Loan Account amounts to US$141.7 million. As per the
Loan Agreement, the counterpart contribution from the government was to be 25% of the project
cost. Total counterpart contribution amounts to Naira 879 million or 23.7% of the total project
cost applying historic exchange rates. As of December 31, 1997, US$51.4 million of the Loan
has been repaid by the Government of Nigeria.
C.   Implementation Schedule
26.   Originally the Loan was to assist to finance the FDH's 1989 to 1991 highway
rehabilitation and maintenance program. Due to the delays experienced up to effectiveness of
the Loan and delays in implementation, as explained in chapter 3.A above, the actual project
implementation period was March 1990 to June 1997, or six years and ten months during which
only about 50% of the physical objectives were achieved.
D.   Analysis of Key Factors Affecting Major Objectives
27.   Macroeconomic and politicalfactors: The failure of the government to restructure and
privatize the oil sector or to allow importation of bitumen and fuel led to extended shortages of
these products with grave consequences for the project. The artificial pegging of the exchange
rate made project management difficult and led to the misuse of the Special Account by the
Ministry's banker. Political turmoil and frequent change of key project personnel contributed to
implementation delays.
28.   Pricing offuel and bitumen At about US cents 15 equivalent per liter, the Nigerian fuel
price is still one of the lowest in the world at about 50% of the border price. This low price
leads to massive smuggling of fuel to the surrounding countries and thereby strongly reduces
these countries' taX revenues from fuel sales, and leads to fuel shortages within Nigeria. It also
leads to distortion of the demand for road traffic, with negative consequences for other means of
transportation. The initially extremely low bitumen price (Naira 600 or US$8 equivalent per ton
which is 3% of the world market price of about US$240 per ton) led to a bias towards asphaltic
concrete pavement construction and against regular maintenance. Subsequent arbitrary and
massive price adjustments of both fuel and bitumen (fuel from 70 kobo per liter to Naira 11 per
liter in 1994, and biturnen from Naira 600 to 12,000 in 1996) resulted in the need for
extraordinary price adjustments of the on-going works contracts, which in tum caused further
execution delays.
29.   Unsuitable institutional structure of FMVWH: The institutional decline described in
chapter 1.B led to a continued decreasing capacity to execute the project. However, besides
those generic issues, the FMWH organizational structure is highly unsuitable for proper road
management. The FHD, although by far the most important, is only one of seven departments of



-8 -
the Ministry. The PMU was headed by a Deputy Director (although the PMU spent more money
than the rest of the Ministry), who consequently had to get approval for any decision or payment
from three layers above.
30.   Generally unsuitable road management set up in Nigeria: Road management in Nigeria
is hampered by a proliferation and increasing number of agencies (36 controllers of FMWIH, one
in each state; 36 Highway Departmnents at state level, and about 700 Works Departments at local
government level), by unclear and overlapping responsibilities, by bureaucratic, unresponsive
agencies and lack of technical capacity.
E.   Assessment of the Borrower's and the Bank's Performance
31.   The performance of both the Borrower and the Bank was less than satisfactory in the
preparation and implementation of the project. Unrealistic assumptions were made by the Bank
regarding the capacity of FMWH to execute the project. A closer look at the past performance
regarding execution of road projects would have shown the deficiencies of the FMWH.
Assumptions regarding macroeconomic performance were unrealistic, and were not founded on
previous performance. During the implementation phase assessment of the client's performance
by the Bank kept being overly optimistic without a realistic assessment of the underlying
fundamental problems. This finally led to a situation where almost the entire Loan amount was
committed in on-going projects and cancellation of the Loan or a restructuring of the project
became impossible or messy. Towards the end of the project, extensions of the Loan closing date
were granted on a six monthly basis with the hope that the borrower would improve its
performance. However, such improved performance failed to materialize.
F.    Assessment of Project's Outcome
32.   The outcome of the project is judged as unsatisfactory. While the road rehabilitation
objectives have, after long delays, partly been achieved, none of the other objectives regarding
maintenance, road safety and institutional development have been achieved.
4. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, FUTURE OPERATIONS AND KEY LESSONS LEARNT
A.   Important Findings of Project Implementation Experience
33.   Macroeconomic risks such as policies towards fuel and bitumen pricing and more
importantly, policies towards the supply of bitumen were not sufficiently built into the project
design. The country's refineries were mismanaged and were frequently breaking down leading
to shortages of bitumen and fuel, essential ingredients in road construction. GON's
unwillingness to allow importation of bitumen was one of the major contributor to the project's
failure.



-9 -
34.   A lot of time (18 months) was lost after Loan effectiveness, due to the fact that initial
.igns and tender docur.ents were not available. The use of the project preparatory facility
ether preparatory funding to prepare initial designs is highly recommended in order to
-:lays.
35.   An ir': istional consulting firm was employed to assist the Ministry's PMU. As a result
of the burea:zratic structure and lack of incentive to the staff of the Ministry, it was very
difficult to build up capacity during project implementation. The lesson is that technical
assistance will not build capacity, if the structures of the implementing agency are not right.
36.   The institutional set up for road management in Nigeria is not viable. There are too many
agencies with weak capacity, and resulting political interference. Fundamental restructuring of
the road sector is required. in order to achieve sustainability.
B.    Future Operations and Sustainability
37.   Since 1993 no new projects have become effective in Nigeria and in 1995 all preparations
for new projects were halted, mainly due to unsatisfactory macroeconomic perforrnance. The
current Bank strategy focuses on sector dialogue, on macroeconomic adjustment and on
restructuring and improved implementation. The remaining two on-going road projects, the first
and second Multi-State Roads Projects, have been restructured to assist the road reform process
in the framework of the Road Vision 2000 Initiative.
38.   Attempts to reform road management in Nigeria have a long history. As early as 1978
proposals were made to create a Federal Highway Authority as a parastatal organization. In the
early 1990s two workshops were held within the framework of the African Road Maintenance
Initiative (RMI). Under the Highway Sector Loan, a Road Organization and Management Study
was financed and a workshop was held. All these attempts to reform road management pointed
at the urgent need for major reform.
39.   The latest attempt at reform is the Road Vision 2000 Initiative. A workshop held in June
1996, jointly with the government and private sector road user representatives concluded the
following: (i) a National Roads Board (NRB) with a majority of private sector road user
representatives should be created and should be responsible for the maintenance of all roads in
Nigeria; (ii) funding for the road maintenance should be through a Road Fund accrued mainly
from a fuel levy; (iii) highly trafficked roads should be established as toll roads and managed by
private sector concessionaires.
40.   In the meantime, a Steering Committee, reflecting the future set up the National Roads
Board, has been created and is overseeing the on-going reform process. Three studies are being
executed in support of the reform and are being financed from the two Multi-State Roads
Projects: (i) a Framework Study, defining the institutional framework for road management; (ii)
a Concession Study, exploring the feasibility of private sector road management concessions;
and (iii) a Road Network Study, assessing the condition and maintenance needs of the Nigerian
road network as a basis of decision making for the NRB. It is hoped that by mid 1998 concrete
proposals can be presented to GON.



- 10-
41.   Regarding future operations in the road sector, the Bank should continue to support the
reform process. Ownership for the reform must clearly be born by the Nigerian stakeholders.
Possible future support by the Bank, once the reform process is showing results, could be in the
form of guarantees for private sector concessionaires for the management of highly trafficked
roads and investments in the recovery of the badly deteriorated road network. Particular
attention would have to be given to the rural road network, which will be required for the
recovery of the rural sector. Studies and discussions with road users representatives show that
road users are prepared to contribute substantially to the required financing of the road recovery
program, if they are involved in the management through the proposed National Roads Board.
C.    Lessons for Future Projects in the Sector
42.   One of the most important lessons to be learnt from this project, as from many other road
projects in developing countries, is that in order to achieve sustainable finance of road
maintenance, the road users must be involved in the management of the roads. The road users
(transport operators etc.) have an interest in good roads and are willing to contribute, as long as
they have a say in the management of the funds.
43.   Unless a fundamental reform of the management of the roads can be achieved with true
stakeholder ownership of the reform process, the Bank should not finance further road projects,
but should focus on the promotion of the reform process.

ROAD VISION 2000
SPECIAL MEETING OF THE STEERING COMMITTEE
HELD ON 25TH JUNE 1997
CONCLUSIONS
1.     After a review of the history of the evolution of the Road Vision 2000 it was agreed that the
Government and rhe country are committed to the road management reform process. This was confirmed
by the message cf the Honourab]e Minister to the meeting delivered by the Director Federal Highways.
2.     It was decided that the NRB will be a funding agency and not an executive agency. NRB will fund effective
road agencies whose work will be done by consultants and contractors.
3.     According to the constitution of the country roads belong to Government at the three tiers of Federal, State
and Local Govermment. They can only be vested to Road agencies for maintenance.
4.     The Nationai Road Board will only be involved with the restoration of the existing road network. The new
construction will continue to be financed from usual Gover,nment Budgetary arrangement
S.     The Road Network study will provide information on the state of the roads and estimate of how much will
be recuired to restore the nerwork. The information to be provided by them will be used by the framework
consultants to recommend the distribution of resources between the three main classes of roads.
?rioritisation of roads should also be the responsibility of the transport consultants.
6.     The Concession Study will provide information on the feasibility of expecting resources from road
concessiors towards the road restoration process. It should also made recommendations on making road
concession rogramrne attractive to the private sector.
7.     The meeting considered options ofthe framework of the National Road Board under. our main options
(i)    State-based Road Agencv to manage all roads within the State
(ii)    Tne establishment of a Federal Highways Agency and State Highways Agencies who will manage State and
Legal Gove,rnment roacs.
(iii) Road Management consultants managing the network in zones of combination of States zones.
(iv)    National Road Board to set efficiency criteria for Road Agencies to qualify for allocation of the Road Fund.

I wish to thank vou for the cooperation extended to the recent World Bank
mnission that visited the Mvinistry ;oml June 16 to 27, 1997, led by Mr. Diet-': Scheling.
I trust by now you have had a chance to circulate a-.nd review the Aie-IMemoire
dated June 27, 1997, prepared and left behind by the mission. Bank management has
reviewed the Aide-Mennoire and endorses the recommendations and agreernts
contained there-in.
As per Annex I of the Aide-Mernoire, the following are thle most im:crLant.
activities that the Ministry should urgently undertake, in order to properly clo se the
project:
a) all final payments du: to the contractors must be processed within the
Ministry and deposited with the Resident Mfission office in Abut not later
than Ocrober 16, 1997; As you know, afzer October 31, 1997, p.oceeds of the
Loan remaining unwithdra%wn will be canceled.
b) in order to enable the Project Support Unit (PSU) to make the Naira portion of
these payments, an additional amount of Naira 125 million in counterpart
funding is required.
c) the audit report as per December 31, 1997 was due by June 30. 1997. Please
arrange for paayments due to the auditors and ensure timely compi-:ion of the

In respect of Road Vision 2000, 1 am glad to note from the conclusion of the
special meeting of the Steering Committee held on June 25, 1997, that progress has been
made towards the formulation of a future more effective road management in Nigeria. It
is obvious that still a lot of terrain is to be covered by the Steering Committee until it will
be able to present a consolidated proposal to the Government.
To provide a basis for the decision making by the Steering Committee it is
important that the three studies being carried out in support of the reform process
expeditiously proceed and that payment is made.to the consultants.
In order to enable the proper functioning of the Steering Committee it is also
imnportant that the Ministry approves the additional funding proposed to be included in
the Framework Study for awareness campaigns, study tours and operational costs of the
Steering Commit;e.:
I would like to assure you of the Bank' s continued su-pport to this initiative of the
MVinistry.
S incerely,
_- /

World Bank ends failed Nigeria roads project
RTw 7/1197 7:06 AM
Copyright 1997 Reuters Ltd. All nghts reserved.
The following news report may not be republished or redistributed, in whole or in part without
the prior wKtten consent of Reuters Ltd.
ABUJA, July 1 (Reuter) - The Wodd Bank on Tuesday said it had closed a $250 million loan
to revamp Nigera's roads, saying the project had failed in the face of mismanagement and
political and economic insta-bility.
In a statement released in the Nigerian capital, the bank said only $120 million of the
original Ican amount of $250 million, approved in June 1988, had been spent despite
extensions of the original closing date of June 1993.
It said the main reasons for the failure of the project were the political and rnacroeconomic
instability in Nigeria during the project's implementation. ,
Flagged at the outset as a project to rehabilitate 1,500 km (900 miles) of roads and build 17
bridges, the result was about 500 krn (300 miles) of road works and seven bridges completed.
Political and economic crisis have gripped Africa's most populous nation since the
annulment of 1993 electons by a military govemment.
VWhile current military ruler Genoal Sani Abacha won World Bank praise for tough
anti-inflation colicies, his clique of generals has not grasped the nettle of privatising state
enterprises or abolishing dual exchange rates and subsidies.
The cancelled road project suffered from frequent changes in key government personnel,
long delays in decision making, delays in payments to contractors and a lack of bitumen, the
bank said.
"The lesson leamt fronm this project is that fundamental restructuring as to how roads are
managed in Nigeria is required," the statLement said.
