                                         ~~~       ~



Financing Data          SDR 235.2 million (US$350 million equivalent). Standard IDA terms:
                       40-year maturity with a 10-year grace period. The proposed operation
                        i s processedunder IDA Financial Crisis ResponseFast-Track Facility.

Operation Type         An eighth Poverty Reduction Support Credit, as the third ina cycle of
                       five operations aimed at implementing Vietnam's Socio-Economic
                       Development Plan 2006-2010, approved inJune 2006.

Main Policy Areas      The present operation provides further support to Vietnam's reform
                       program. The current cycle of PRSCs i s a vehicle for IDA, and the
                        international partner community more broadly, to support a country
                       that has undergone macroeconomic instability and i s suffering from
                       the effects of the global financial crisis. This support i s all the more
                        important as it helps finance the government's fiscal stimulus package
                       to counter the adverse effects of the global crisis and limit the depth of
                       growth slow down, so that the poverty-reduction reforms can stay on
                       track. The government has a strong track record of economic growth
                       and poverty reduction.

                       The proposed operation comprises policy actions in areas such as
                        state-owned enterprise reform, financial sector reform, the social
                        sectors, climate change, public administration and legal development.
                       This comprehensive program, with the same broad coverage as the
                       SEDP 2006-2010, provides the foundation for sustained growth, social
                       inclusion, environmental sustainability and improved governance.

                       The preparation of the proposed operation, like previous operations in
                       this cycle, helped improve the content of strategically important policy
                       actions, to ensure the timeliness of their adoption, and to monitor the
                       impact of the overall progress toward development outcomes.

Key Outcome Indicators Outcome indicators were identified at the beginning of this PRSC
                       cycle, together with the targets for 2011, in the ProgramDocument for
                       PRSC 6 submitted to the Board in June 2007. It i s reproduced in
                       Annex 3, with the most recent updates available. The indicators cover
                       the four pillars of the program. A mid-term evaluation of progress
                       towards attaining the program's objectives is in progress during the
                       preparation of this operation.

ProgramDevelopment     The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), submitted to the Board in
Objectives and         January 2007, concluded that the SEDP of the government
Contribution to CAS    incorporated the necessary poverty reduction principles, was broadly
                       sound and was a plan that could both deliver growth and reduce
                       poverty. The CPS defines the PRSC as one of the modalities to

                                              i

support the implementation of SEDP. The Program Document for
PRSC 6 charts the second cycle of PRSC operations (PRSCs 6-10).
The CPS allocates US$ 150million to each of the PRSCs inthis cycle.
The amount of credit for this operation i s increased by US$200
million on the basis of the government's financing needs to mitigate
the effects of the global crisis.

Vietnam i s now confronted with an unprecedented global financial
crisis. Exports have slowed, and foreign direct investments and
remittances from abroad declined. The government i s administering a
stimulus package, which raises challenges both on financing and on
implementation.      IDA is assisting the government through both
technical advice and financial support.      The dialogue incorporates
responses in relation to the more efficient use of state capital and in
financial sector reform. By providing resources directly to the budget,
the proposed credit helps the government in financing the stimulus
package and mitigatingthe social impacts of the economic slowdown.

The risk of a balance-of-payments problemhas receded since last year,
with a rapidly shrinking trade deficit and slower capital inflows
diminishingthe current account deficit from both sides. International
reserves, estimated to be US$20billion in April 2009 (four months of
imports) appear adequate. The authorities are also cautiously moving
inthe direction of a more flexible exchange rate regime. The proposed
credit contributes to further the integration of Vietnam into the world
economy by supporting a more conducive environment for businesses
and financially-sustainablearrangementsfor developing infrastructure.

The risk of financial sector turbulence had increased as a result of the
asset price bubbles of 2007-08. The State Bank of Vietnam has
strengthened supervision and tightened prudential rules. An interest
rate subsidy scheme introduced as part of the stimulus package has
amounted to a restructuring of enterprise debt, preventing the
deterioration of bank portfolios. In addition to the policy actions
included in this operation, the World Bank i s also supporting banking
sector reforms through an investment credit and technical assistance.

The risk that governance reforms do not keep pace with rapid
developments i s probably the most serious in the mediumterm. Cases
of corruption and social strife are increasingly related to land
reallocation, clearance and compensation. Tackling this risk requires
rapid progress in transparency at various levels, from regional
planning to infrastructure master plans to land use to appropriate
taxation to the monitoring of assets of the relevant civil servants. This
area receives special attention in the proposed operation, including
several actions to improve transparency inpublic administration.

1.       The eighth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC 8) is designed to assist the government
to implement its Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006-2010.' It aims to support all four
pillars of the SEDP, namely, fostering business development, ensuring social inclusion, managing
natural resources, and strengthening governance. The proposed credit i s the third in a programmatic
series of five annual single-tranche operations (PRSCs 6-10). This series follows the first cycle of
five operations (PRSCs 1-5). The PRSCs are well-suited to support the implementation of the SEDP,
as the cross-cutting nature of the policy dialogue conducted through PRSCs encourages taking a
holistic view of the reform agenda, and promotes collaboration among line ministries and government
agencies. The annual programmingi s demanding, but provides the government with predictability for
planning purposes, and also helps keep the reformmomentum.

2.       The PRSCs are designed to be forward-looking. The negotiation of each PRSC operation
includes reaching an agreement on a list of policy measures that will, in principle, be supported by the
following operation. These policy measures, or "triggers," are grounded in the SEDP 2006-2010 as
well as other key documents and strategies, and are considered to have strategic importance to attain
the SEDP objectives. Triggers are very limited in number. They are not conditions but rather a
framework to guide the policy dialogue in the subsequent operation. It is understood that some
triggers may not be fully met while others may be exceeded. Inaddition to the "triggers," the policy
dialogue conducted under PRSCs addresses a broader set of issues, articulated as "benchmarks."
These benchmarks are reported to convey the scope of the reforms being implemented. They are not
part of the legal agreement, although they strengthen the implementation of the SEDP. The relatively
large number of benchmarks i s justified by the committed participation in the PRSC process of close
to two dozen government ministries and agencies and more than a dozen donors.

3.       The proposed operation i s processed under the IDA Financial Crisis Response Fast-Track
Facility in order to help meet the financing necessary to implement the government's fiscal stimulus
package as well as the reformprogram supported by the PRSC operation.

RECENTECONOMICTRENDS

4.       Having weathered a domestic crisis in early 2008, Vietnam i s now looking to navigate the
global crisis. Accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), in early 2007 had reassured
investors about the government's commitment to economic reform. It translated into massive capital
inflows in late 2007 and early 2008, resulting in economic overheating. Over the year, the capital
account surplus reached US$17 billion, whereas remittances (which have a strong investment
component in Vietnam) were close to US$7 billion. Together they amounted to over a third of the
gross domestic product (GDP) (US$70 billion in 2007). Attempts to sterilize these inflows were not

able to prevent a boom in banking credit, an acceleration in inflation, a ballooning trade deficit and
asset price bubbles.

5.         A determined reaction by the government from March 2008 onward (the "eight groups of
measures") succeeded in stabilizing the economy. In spite of surging world prices of food and oil,
tight monetary policy and some measure of fiscal restraint ended the asset price bubbles and brought
monthly inflation down from more than 3 percent a month to virtually zero in barely six months.
Combined with a more active management of trade policy and the foreign exchange market, the
stabilization package also succeeded in reducing the trade deficit to manageable levels. The overall
economic situation was still fragile around May,2008, when markets were nervous about a possible
balance of payments crisis. There were also concerns about the health of the banking system, and
especially about the quality of loans related to real estate and urban development. However, it
gradually became apparent that the stabilization package was working, and tensions eased.

6.       The stabilization package took a toll on economic activity, with the second quarter of 2008
recording one of the lowest growth rates in years (5.8 percent). At 6.2 percent, the GDP growth for
2008 was about 2 percentage points below historic trend. Most sectors coped reasonably well, and
approvals for foreign direct investment (FDI) projects continued on the rise, reaching a record US$64
billion for the year as a whole (71 percent of GDP). However, the construction sector had its worst
performance since the East Asian crisis, squeezed between frozen or declining property prices, high
interest rates and high international prices for cement and steel. In the second half of 2008, the
financial crisis originating in the United States affected foreign demand. International prices of


                                                        3

commodities exported by Vietnam were on a declining trend since the third quarter, export orders for
garments and other industrial products collapsed in the fourth quarter, and a slowdown in
manufacturing became noticeable. According to the official statistics, job losses appear to be modest,
and the labor market remains tight for the skilled and semi-skilled. However, the impact is stronger in
some of the large industrial parks, with casual and seasonal workers losing their jobs and others their
overtime pay.

7.      The government reacted swiftly to this second economic shock, shifting gears from
stabilization to supporting economic activity (the "five groups of measures") inNovember 2008. The
immediate components of this reaction included cutting payments of enterprise income tax, deferring
payments of personal income tax, and providing a cash handout to poor households on the occasion of
the Lunar New Year. However, the most decisive move concerned monetary policy. This was seen as
an urgent priority given the risk of economic activity suffering disproportionately from the
combination of very high lending interest rates (around 21 percent by August 2008), a very rapid
deceleration of inflation (there was actually deflation in the last quarter of 2008) and the slowdown in
the demand for exports. The main policy rate was brought down by 7 percentage points over a short
period of time, and a credit guarantee scheme was established for small and medium enterprises
(SMEs). In addition, an interest rate subsidy of 4 percentage points was introduced for working
capital loans. In practice, this scheme amounted to refinancing of the debts by enterprises which
could prove that they had viable operating plans.

8.      Thanks to the stabilization efforts in early 2008, the Vietnamese economy was in a better
position to weather the global crisis than it would have been a year ago. At the beginning of 2009, the
trade account was roughly inbalance. Over the first quarter of 2009, exports declined by 11.6 percent
excluding the gold re-exports compared to the same period in 2009 (exports including gold grew by
7.4 percent), whereas imports decreased roughly by 41.3 percent. The current account deficit i s
projected to be about 5 percent of GDP in 2009, down from 11.9 percent in 2008. Capital and
intermediate goods constitute the bulk of Vietnam's imports. Foreign direct investors are large net
importers, and the shrinking current account deficit in the first four months of 2009 i s closely linked
with the 30.2 percent decline (year-on-year) in the implemented FDI. The projected current account
deficit should, therefore, be manageable. However, the international reserves are expected to decline
in2009 reversingthe recent trend of slow accumulation.

9.      The banking sector i s muddling through.       Quantitative indicators of the quality of their
portfolio, based on days in arrears and rollovers, indicate that the fraction of non-performing loans
(NPLs) had started to decline in October 2008, when the monetary policy easing started, but are
slowly climbing again. Qualitative indicators, basedon borrower risk, suggest a higher level of NPLs.
Duringthe period of turbulence, the SBV upgraded its supervision efforts, including strengthened on-
site supervision and raising minimumcapital requirements. By the end of 2008, all commercial banks
had raised their capital to the new minimum levels. The first phase of the interest rate subsidy
scheme, which was for working capital and for a limited period of time, mainly benefitted private
enterprises. B y encouraging banks to lend, it supported a rapid restructuring of bank loans without
leading to an increase in total credit. The recently announced second phase of the interest rate
subsidy scheme, for investments and for up to two years, may have a more adverse effect on the
quality of lending. Credit to the economy has started to pick up, and with it, inflationary pressure as
well.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

10.     While a crisis i s unlikely in 2009, growth will be slower than in 2008. The 2009 growth
forecasts by multilateral institutions range from 3.5 to 5.5 percent. The impact of the global turmoil
was severe in the first quarter of 2009, resulting in 3.1 percent growth (year-on-year), about 4



                                                   4

percentage points below trend (the average for first quarter growth over the last few years was 7.2
percent).

11.      There are some indications of recovery. Agriculture i s expected to experience solid growth
during the rest of the year, after a poor first quarter due to the floods in the north of the country.
Helpedby reduced interest rates and lower cement and steel costs, the construction sector reversed the
three-quarters-long contraction trend and grew by 6.9 percent (year-on-year) in the first quarter of
2009. As of April 2009, electricity consumption and retail sales registered real grown rate of 10.7 and
7.5 percent, respectively, compared to the same period in 2008. This suggests that the manufacturing
and services sectors are also coping.

12.      On the other hand, there i s anecdotal evidence that the economic slowdown may become
protracted. Systematic indicators are not available in highenough frequency to judge how broadly or
deeply the downturn i s affecting the labor force, but many in the export sector are working on a
reduced schedule or put on forced or unpaid leave. Many migrant workers have returned to rural
areas or are strugglingto survive on partial pay and reduced hours inthe cities. The rapid assessment
conducted highlighted how the lack of occupation mobility and low skill levels among Vietnamese
workers creates uneven impacts. The limited information available suggests that erstwhile migrant
workers are not easily absorbed into the rural economy.

13.      Sustaining economic growth during the remainder of 2009 will require reliance on domestic
demand, especially if the recovery in the developed world i s delayed, and international trade-related
activities do not pick up. At the end of 2008, the government announced a budget plan for 2009
which included a sizeable stimulus component. Whether the labor-intensive projects included in the
stimulus package succeed in absorbing the unemployed and under-employed workers ina productive
and timely manner would be an important element indetermining the growth outcome for 2009.



                                                      5

14.     The focus of the stimulus package i s to scale up critically important public investments,
especially in energy and transport. Infrastructure bottlenecks remain an important obstacle to the
long-term development of the Vietnamese economy. The focus seems appropriate but the overheating
of late 2007 and early 2008 had exposed important weaknesses in capital expenditures. Lack of
coordination among provinces and sectors had led to a potentially costly duplication of public
investments and resulted in insufficient consideration to their environmental impacts. Large state-
owned enterprises (SOEs) had taken advantage of their liquidity to venture into real estate and
financial investments, further fueling the ongoing asset price bubbles. Weak management of the
project had led to projects with dubious returns and poor implementation. Addressing weaknesses in
the implementation of public investments should thus be a natural complement to the stimulus
package.

15.     Vietnam has some fiscal space to finance a part of the announced stimulus package. A debt
sustainability analysis completed after the announcement of the 2009 budget plan suggests that
Vietnam's external debt position i s robust. The total public external debt i s estimated to stand at 25
percent of GDP (30 percent including the private sector) at the end of 2008. With nearly two-thirds of
this debt contracted on highly concessional terms, the ratio of debt service to exports is projected to
remain at or below 5 percent in the coming years. The baseline scenario does not include the
increased fiscal deficit for financing the stimulus package, but even the stress tests, including a large
increase in debt-creating flows, indicated that Vietnam's debt was largely sustainable in the long-run.
A large increase in fiscal deficit financed by non-concessional loans and a large (30 percent) and
sustained depreciation of the dong were identified as main risksto debt sustainability. Both scenarios
are considered unlikely. Total public debt also remains manageable, as the bulk of domestic debt i s
issued long-term. Before the latest announcements on the stimulus package, it was expected to
increase from its current 47.5 percent of GDP to 50.7 percent by 2012.

16.     The main constraint to support the active fiscal stance of the government stems from
financing rather than from debt sustainability. The budget plan foresaw the issuance of a second
sovereign bond, which i s now unlikely in the current global context. Meanwhile, the additional
components of the stimulus package, adopted after the plan was approved, have increased the
financing gap. Based on the current figures, there remains a gap of around 29.5 trillion dong (US$1.7
billion - see Tables 2 and 3).      It could be higher if tax payment deferrals are converted into
exemptions and once the fiscal impacts of the interest rate subsidies materialize. Adopting an
inadequately funded stimulus package could affect market sentiment; excessive reliance on domestic
finance could crowd out the private sector; attempts to monetize a part of the cost of financing the
stimulus package would reignite the inflationary tendencies. In the absence of resources to finance
further spending in infrastructure, the government may rely more on SOEs to carry out the needed
investments, which could decrease transparency and efficiency of the investments. Alternatively, they
may postpone or cancel some of the measures and thus miss the opportunity to limit the depth of the
growth slowdown, which will hurt the poor and the vulnerable the most. These risks associated with
the financing gap make the contribution of quick-disbursing official development assistance (ODA)
all the more important, and justify the increase in the amount of the credit for the proposed operation
for the purpose of supportingthis fiscal stimulus package.


      111.    THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAMAND PARTICIPATORYPROCESSES


17.     The government's vision i s articulated in several strategic plans and documents, including the
ten-year Socio-economic Development Strategy 2001-2010 and the five-year SEDP 2001-2006.
There was a noticeable acceleration, starting around 2001, in the government's drive towards relying
on market mechanisms, developing a multi-stakeholder economy and further integrating with the
region and the world. These strategic plans and documents aimed at establishing a market economy

                                                   6

with a socialist orientation. They built on the successes of the renovation process initiated in the late
 1980s with Obi mdi, while also preserving the strong poverty-reduction focus.

 18.    The SEDP 2006-2010, approved in June 2006, emphasizes development outcomes and the
policy reforms needed to attain them, unlike previous five-year plans which focused on quantitative
targets as if the state was still in charge of producing most goods and services. It relies on data
analyses, rather than administrative reporting, to substantiate its diagnostics and recommendations. It
has also led to the adoption of a framework to monitor progress towards attaining development
outcomes. The process through which the SEDP was prepared was more participatory than in the
past. Extensive consultations were held, going beyond the boundaries of government, and involving
businesses, grassroots communities, overseas Vietnamese and development partners.

 19.     Other important policy developments have influenced this reform agenda. By mid-2003, the
government decided to aim for a rapid accession to the WTO. In late 2003, a new anti-corruption
strategy started to emerge, with the emphasis shifting from punitive measures to increased
transparency and strengthening of the government systems. The new comprehensive anti-corruption
strategy was adopted in May 2009, setting out preventive, demand-side solutions and monitoring
mechanisms. The year 2004 saw the coming into effect of the new Budget Law, which makes the
National Assembly and People's Councils at all levels responsible for resource appropriations. A
banking reform roadmap was adopted in 2006 to prepare the banking sector for liberalization in
accordance with Vietnam's WTO commitments. The roadmap included revisions of the Laws on
SBV and on Credit Institutions, as well as preparation of Bank Supervision Law and Deposit
Insurance Law.


               IV.     BANKSUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM


LINK TO CPS

20.     The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) submitted in January 2007 concluded that the SEDP
had incorporated the necessary poverty reduction principles, was broadly sound and was a plan that
could both deliver growth and reduce poverty. The CPS defines the PRSC as one of the modalities to
support the implementation of SEDP. The ProgramDocument for PRSC 6, submitted to the Board in
June 2007, charts the second cycle of PRSC operations (PRSCs 6-10). The CPS allocates US$l50
million to each of the PRSCs in the second cycle. In practice, however, the amount for PRSC 6 was
increased to US$175 million. PRSC 7 was presented to the Board in June 2008 for the amount of
US$l50 million. There was an agreement among the government, co-financiers, and IDA that the
performance was relatively weak, but that it was due to difficult economic conditions rather than to
waning commitment from the Government for reforms.

21.     The amount of credit the CPS allocates to PRSC 8 i s also US$l50 million. A higher amount
for PRSC 8 i s not linked to performance against reforms set out in the agreed policy matrix, but
justified on the needs basis, as the government faces a prospect of higher fiscal deficits in 2009-10
due to projected shortfalls in revenues and a larger expenditure to finance the fiscal stimulus package.
Future decisions on the amounts of PRSCs remaining in this series (PRSC 9 and PRSC 10) will be
taken based on performance relative to agreed policy reforms to be supported by these operations, and
possibly Vietnam's budget support needs at the time inthe context of the global economic crisis

22.     At the same time as increasing the credit amount in the proposed operation to ensure
financing necessaryto fund the fiscal stimulus package i s available on urgent basis, IDA i s taking the
opportunity of the global crisis to discuss and agree with the government substantive reforms in the
energy sector and in the area of public investment management and planning, where significant
efficiency improvements can be made. These reform operations will be delivered inFY10.

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMFAND OTHERDONORS

23.      The PRSC operations serve as an aid harmonization device, supported by an increasing
number of development partners. The PRSCs have been co-financed by bilateral and multilateral
agencies, either through grants or parallel lending (Table 4). More importantly, the process saw a
transition inthe role of co-financiers, from providers of finance to partners engagedin the preparation
of the operations and the policy dialogue with the Government. This dialogue i s organized by policy
areas, in which development partners engage selectively, based on their interests and technical
capacity on the ground. The PRSC framework also serves as a coordination device for technical
assistance (TA) provided by donors, and the TA in turn provides valuable inputs to the policy
dialogue.

24.     Inaddition, assessment and projections on macroeconomic indicators are discussedregularly
with the IMF. While specific point projections could vary, there i s a broad agreement between the
two institutions on the status of the economy and the direction it should take so that the country would
continue on the robust growth path and to attain its poverty-reduction goals. The two institutions also
collaborate on annual debt sustainability analysis.

RELATIONSHIPTO OTHERBANKOPERATIONS

25.     The CPS is organized around the four pillars of the SEDP, with the policy dialogue to help
implement Vietnamese reform program. The PRSCs are the apex of policy dialogue, while sector
development policy lendings (DPLs) delve deeper into sector-specific dialogue. When there i s a need
for a more focused sector policy dialogue, sector DPLs complement the PRSCs, as i s the case with
Program 135 Phase 2 Support (P107062), Higher Education Development Policy Program (P104694).
High-level actions fall under PRSC, and more detailed ones are treated under sectoral DPLs. A
program comprising investment lending, analytical work, and technical assistance supports
implementation at the sectoral level.     There i s a strong complementarity between the different
components of the program. The overall direction of the policy dialogue i s informed by the analytical
work.    Concrete policy measures are often made possible by preparatory technical assistance.
Investment credits also provide an opportunity to pilot new initiatives and approaches, which are then
scaled up through the policy dialogue. The reforms supported by the latter, in turn, enhance the
effectiveness of sectoral investments.     The lending program i s being complemented with the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) resources starting in fiscal 2009.
The financing priorities for IDA and IBRD include energy, transport, tertiary education, water, urban,
and health sectors.

26.     Several of the ongoing or pipeline investment projects and analytical and advisory activity
(AAA) products are particularly complementary to the PRSCs. In the financial sector, Financial
Sector Modernization and Information System Project (P088759), Payment System and Bank
Modernization Project (P082627), Financial Market Infrastructure Development (P105198), and
Policy Note on Banking Sector Reform (PI12285), as well as Institutional Development Fund (IDF)
grants supporting Development of Legal Foundation for Vietnam's Banking System (P104484) and
Strengthening Accounting Capacity of State-Owned Commercial Banks (SOCBs) (P104702) work
hand-in-hand with the PRSCs' efforts to modernize the central bank, increase disclosures of relevant
financial information, and contribute to the development of the financial sector in general. In
addition, technical assistance for Enhancing Deposit Insurance in Vietnam (P110730-TA091526) and
for Strengthening Public Credit Registration inVietnam (P113854-TA092765) i s also on going.

27.     Inthe education sector, the Banks lending operations and non-lending activities complement
the PRSC's focus on fundamental education strategy and policies in the areas of quality, equity and
accountability. Investment lending supports the development and implementation of standards-based
approaches to education delivery, especially to disadvantaged groups of children (Primary Teacher
Development Project (PO51838), Primary Education for Disadvantaged Children Project (P044803)
and School Education Quality Assurance Project (PO91747)) and the exercise of autonomy (combined
with accountability) at higher levels of the education sector (Higher Education Project (P004828),
Second Higher Education Project (P079665)). The first sectoral DPL operation will complement the
PRSC series by delivering a more comprehensive set of higher education reforms than can be
delivered through the multi-sectoral PRSC instrument, notably in the areas of governance, financing,
quality assuranceand public financial management.

28.     Seven PRSC operations have supported the implementation of Vietnam's reform agenda so
far. PRSC 1, a two-tranche credit for US$250 million, was approved by the Board inJune 2001. Its
focus was mainly on the structural reform agenda. The second tranche of PRSC 1 was released in
December 2002. PRSC 2, a one-tranche operation for US$lOO million, was approved in June 2003.


                                                   9

This operation was aligned with the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy
(CPRGS) of the Government, which made it possible to broaden considerably the range of reforms
supported. In addition to the mainly structural aspects covered by PRSC 1, this second credit
included various policy actions aimed at keeping development inclusive and building modem
governance. PRSCs 3 to 5 were also one-tranche operations of US$lOO million each. These were
approved inJune 2004,2005 and 2006 respectively and had a broad sectoral coverage.

29.      The sixth PRSC, approved in 2007, launched the second series of PRSCs. The seventh PRSC
was approved in June 2008. These operations added natural resource management and environment
pillar to the other three other pillars inthe previous operations.

LESSONSLEARNED

30.      One of the lessons learned from the previous operations i s the need to have a comprehensive
approach to economic reform for several reasons. First, there are linkages between policy actions
across sectors, so that a piecemeal approach would end up being less effective. For instance,
improving the delivery of social services requires a better balancing of current and capital
expenditures on the supply side, as well as a better understanding of what the priorities are from the
demand-side. Good public financial management i s an essential ingredient to improved results in
health and education sectors. Another obvious example i s the inter-linkages between the anti-
corruption dialogue and public administration reform. As different ministries and agencies are in
charge of these two agenda, PRSC's overarching framework i s useful in addressing the underlying
issues holistically.

31.      Second, there are differences in,the readiness of the leadership to embrace reforms in
different areas, with the window of opportunities difficult to predict. As a result, it is useful to
accumulate various technical building blocks necessary across the entire policy spectrum, so that
ambitious reforms can be supported without delay whenever the opportunity arises.

32.      Finally, the PRSCs serve as a one-stop shop for the interaction between the government and
the donor community. When coordinating the numerous donors with different interests and agenda,
excessive selectivity has proven impractical. Inaddition, it could also represent a lost opportunity, as
the large number of partners translates into a wider range of technical expertise than when IDA i s
acting alone. Hence, the policy action matrix contains fifty odd discussion items at the beginning of
each operation. Policy actions are not conditions but are entering points to guide the policy dialogue.
The policy action matrix narrows down over the course of preparing the operations, as the dialogue
evolves and the readiness of the government counterparts becomes clearer (Annex 2).

33.      A mid-term review of the second PRSC cycle (PRSCs 6-10) is currently underway (see
section VI). Once the review is complete, the findings will be reflected in the design of the
subsequent operations.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

34.      The Vietnam Development Report (VDR) 2007, entitled Aiming High, provides the main
underpinnings for the current PRSC series. The preparation of this report was built on the analytical
work done over the first PRSC cycle, on structural reforms (as summarized in the VDR 2006, on
Business), institutional modernization (VDR 2005, on Governance) and on social inclusion (VDR
2004, on Poverty). The process was led by the World Bank with a large number of development
partners participating, several of them contributing extensive written inputs. Participants includedthe
co-financiers of the first PRSC series as well as other development partners not formally involved in
direct budget support, including the United Nations agencies and international non-governmental
organizations (NGOs). A reviewing committee of recognized Vietnamese experts and policy-makers
advised on each of the policy areas and on the overall thrust of the report.


                                                    10

35.     A new series of VDRs goes more in depth into each of the four pillars of the SEDP 2006-
2010. The first volume in this series, the VDR 2008 on Social Protection, examines the challenges
remaining in relation to poverty alleviation, with a focus on the plight of ethnic minorities. While
representing only 14 percent of the Vietnamese population, ethnic minorities account for a large share
of the poor. Even though their poverty rates have been declining steadily inrecent years, the gap with
the Kinh majority has not narrowed, and some ethnic groups remain especially deprived. The VDR
2008 also analyzes the structural shifts affecting the Vietnamese society, resulting from the
demographic transition and rural-to-urban migration, and the change in the nature of the shocks
experienced by Vietnamese households, from greater exposure to international fluctuations to the
growing importance of communicable diseases. These shifts and shocks have important implications
for the design of public policies and programs, supporting the development of more institutional
social protection mechanisms and the transition to a risk-based approach and demand-side financing
inthe case of the healthsector.

36.     The more recent VDR 2009, Capital Matters, focuses on constraints to the mobilization of
resources for accumulation and on the efficiency of investments by both the public and the private
sector. Some of those constraints are common to many developing countries, whereas others are more
specific to the transition from planned to market economy. The report reviews the operation of the
main channels used to mobilize resources for investment in Vietnam, including tax revenues, bank
borrowing, bond issuance, equity, and ODA.             In the case of public investments, it identifies
weaknesses in the selection, appraisal and implementation of projects. Some of those weaknesses
result from the different speed at which decentralization, public financial management and
environmental policies have progressed in recent years. Special attention i s devoted to state capital,
and the potential risks created by weak corporate governance in SOEs, conflicts of interest in the
Government between ownership and regulation, and the ability of large groups of SOEs to control
financial institutions, thus undoingprevious efforts to harden the budget constraint.

37.     A Public Expenditure Review/ Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (PER-FA) and a Country
Fiduciary Accountability Assessment (CFAA) were carried out in2005 and 2007, respectively. While
noting the progress made, they pointed out areas that are in need of further improvements. These
include the process of budget development, accessibility of financial information, and accounting and
auditing framework. These recommendations form the basis for policy dialogue conducted through
the PRSC series.

38.     The policy dialogue in the energy sector i s informed by extensive analytical work over the
past ten years. Recent analytical work includes support for the preparation and passing of the
Electricity Law (2004) and the Roadmap for Reform of the Electricity Sector (2006), Electricity
Licenses (2006 and 2007), Conceptual Design of Competitive Generation Market (2008), Framework
for Thermal BOT Tenders (ongoing), Development of Market Rules for the Competitive Generation
Market (ongoing), and Grid Code, Distribution Code and Metering Code (ongoing). Work on
restructuring of the electricity sector includes Restructuring the Power TransmissionBusiness (2005),
Equitization of the Power Sector (2006) and most recently a policy note on Restructuring for the
Competitive Generation Market (2008). Pricing studies include Bulk Power, Distribution Margin and
Retail Tariff Design study (2005), Retail Tariff Methodology (2008), Tariff Calculation Model
(ongoing), and Transmission Pricing Methodology (ongoing). The Bank has also reviewed energy
plans and planning processes, particularly Power Master Development Plan No.6 (2006) and the Gas
Master Plan for Southern Vietnam (2008).

equity and women retirement age in Vietnam informs the policy dialogue on gender social protection
issues carried out inPRSC operations.

40.      Forest and forest land management by community and farmers in Vietnam have been a
subject of many studies. These studies include A Brief History of Forest Policy Workfrom the Field
(2002), Review of Policy and Implementation Framework for Decree 200 (2005), and Vietnam Land
Policy Stocktaking Study (2008).

41.      The first study was prepared by Program on Forests (PROFOR) Vietnam3 - a branch of the
global program on Forest. Review of Policy and Implementation Framework for Decree 200 (2005)
was prepared under the umbrella of the Forest Sector Support Program framework which has State
Forest Enterprise (SFE) reform as a priority area requiring attention and assistance. The World Bank
and the Netherlands Development Organization ( S N V ) provided funding and guidance in
collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD). The Review
includes both national and local level perspectives in its recommendations; it i s based on dialogue at
national level as well as fieldwork conducted in five provinces (Nghe An, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang
Nam, Quang Ngai, and Binh Dinh). The review was conducted for the purpose of identifying and
developing the main strategic issues that are critical for understanding the impact of SFE reform and
its future direction.

42.      The Vietnam Land Policy Stocktaking Study (2008) was prepared with extensive participation
of former and current staff of Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE). The goals
of the study were to assess progress, in terms of analysis and understanding of key topics, consolidate
lessons, and begin to identify knowledge gaps and define areas where future work and policy dialogue
could be usefully targeted. The report finds that land issues are implicated in a variety of ways in
Vietnam's ongoing and accelerating economic and social transformation. The nature of rightsto land,
and the extent to which they are perceived as secure and accessible, play key roles in shaping
economic options and livelihood strategies across all sectors of society. Land use policies and
practices greatly influence the availability of and access to land and the prospects for sustainable
management of natural resources and the environment. Land as a source of revenue i s gaining
increasingprominence inthinking about public and private finances at all levels.

43.      Review and Analysis of the Pollution Impactsfrom VietnameseManufacturing Sectors (2008)
informs the policy dialogue on pollution control, although the proposed operation does not
specifically address the manufacturing sectors. The study was prepared by the World Bank team in
partnership with the International Center for Environmental Management as well as the Ministry of
Industryand Trade (MOIT) and MONRE.

44.      Water Sector Review (2008), prepared for the Office of the National Water Resources Council
on behalf of the Government of Vietnam, funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), informs the
water sector dialogue. The coverage of the study includes the current status of water resources and
water-related environments, water supply and sanitation, flooding and natural hazards, irrigation,
aquaculture and fisheries, river basin management.

                        V.      THE PROPOSEDOPERATION


OPERATIONDESCRIPTION

45.      The proposed operation i s timely and critical. The PRSC represents a well-established
mechanism to provide a coordinatedtechnical advice from development partners when the need to act
swiftly without distraction of multiple players i s the greatest. In addition, the financing mobilized
through this operation will be particularly useful in funding the fiscal stimulus package to combat the
negative effects of the global financial crisis and will allow the government to take measures to limit
deepening of the growth slowdown.

46.      The medium-term policy matrix was developed at the beginning of this PRSC cycle (Annex
5). The development outcomes were also established at the same time (Annex 3). The policy actions
included in the matrix are grounded in the SEDP 2006-2010 and other strategic documents and
analytical work. Some of the policy actions are adjusted as new issues arise, such as the unfolding
global financial crisis, new studies become available, or the original plan becomes no longer
applicable. The policy reforms to be discussed ineach PRSC are chosen every year through a process
involving sector teams at the World Bank and participating development partners. Each year, the
matrix starts from nearly 200 initial proposals in September to about 50 policy actions for the official
discussion with the government.

47.      Each year, the policy matrix contains two types of policy actions. The first type i s "triggers,"
which are deemed to be more strategic, because of their potential impact on development outcomes
over time. These actions are selected during the previous PRSC operation, and are reported in the
minutes of the negotiations (PRSC 7 in this case). The triggers that are deemed met become prior
actions for the current operation (Table 6). Analogously, another set of strategic reforms, considered
achievable duringthe next 12 months are chosen duringthis operation, and reported in the minutes of
the negotiations of the proposed operation (Table 7).           The "triggers" represent a collective
understanding of what measures need to be taken to address immediate concerns (for example, the
SBV Law, strengthening financial management of SOEs and their investments), and which medium-
term structural reforms should be tackled as priority (for example, promoting the use of renewable
energy, management of debt). The assessment of triggers i s holistic, with the understanding that some
will not be met completely while others can be exceeded.

48.      In addition to the triggers, the policy matrix also contains additional reform actions
undertaken by the government. This broader set of actions, or "benchmarks," does not reflect the use
of conditionality. Its reporting i s rather intendedto convey the breadth and scope of the reforms being
undertaken by the Government of Vietnam.             By providing a more comprehensive picture of
developments in each policy area, this matrix allows a better understanding of the progress being
made ineach of the four pillars of the reformprogram.

49.      The technical meetings are coordinated by the PRSC Secretariat at the SBV. The Secretariat
reports to the Steering committee for the PRSC process, which is chaired by the first Deputy Prime
Minister. The Secretariat identifies the relevant line ministry or government agency for each of the
proposed policy actions. The technical meetings with those ministries and agencies provide an
opportunity to go into the specifics of each action, to comment on draft policy documents, and to
agree on a time schedule for their completion. As a result of these technical meetings, some measures
are deemed completed, some may be consolidated, and others may be postponed to the next
operations. Pending issues regarding policy actions which are considered of strategic importance
(either interms of content or timing) can be raised to the attentionof the Steering Committee.

POLICYAREAS

50.      The PRSCs 6-10 address the four pillars of the SEDP, namely business development, social
inclusion, natural resource management, and modern governance, in a balanced way. The 11triggers
chosen for the preparation of PRSC 8 are evenly distributed across the four pillars. The progress in
achieving these 11 triggers was assessed in May 2009. According to this assessment, seven of the
triggers are fully met, two are partially met, and two are missed. The missed triggers are: (1) adopt
standards for certification of health care providers and classification of private hospitals, and (2)
prepare a revised Press Law to encourage accurate, objective and responsible reporting on corruption.
The partially-met triggers are: (1) approve a strategic plan to ensure prudential and effective
investment of social security funds, and (2) establish criteria and time-bound plan to access the quality
of forest resources nationwide. Of the two partially-met triggers, the first was considered close to
being met, as the plan was in the final stage, and was submitted to the Governing Board of the
Vietnam Social Security (VSS) for comments, the last step before submitting it for official approval
by the Prime Minister. Therefore, this trigger was rephrased and included in the list of "prior
conditions." The second (forestry) had elements towards meeting the trigger, but was deemed further
away in substance from being met. Therefore, this trigger was postponed to future operations, and
was not included inthe list of "prior actions."

51.      The fact that not all triggers were met reflects a less than stellar performance, as well as how
ambitious these programs are: PRSC triggers are aimed highenough so that they are challenging. The
expectation i s that not all triggers will be met in all operations whereas some will be exceeded. The
performance under PRSC8 i s roughly comparable to PRSC 7, which had 14 triggers with 8 met, 5
partially met, and one missed. There were no triggers inPRSC 6, which was the first one inthe cycle.
Inthe first cycle, all 15 triggers were metinPRSC 5, whereas performance was similar under PRSC4
(3 out of 15 triggers partially met) and PRSC 3 (1 out of 14 triggers was not met and 2 were partially
met). There were no explicit triggers for PRSC2.

52.      The Task Team's assessment i s that the slippages are a reflection of technical obstacles or
misreading political economy and institutional process. There is a clear commitment and substantial
progress towards developing a social security investment strategy, establishing certification standards
for health care practitioners and classification of private hospitals, and adopting criteria for
classifying forests. All triggers represent a ground-breaking achievement, and the government teams
runinto technical problems due to inadequate capacity. The revision of the Press Law was expected
to offer an opportunity to protect better journalists and media outlets which report on corruption,
while at the same time dissuading libel and defamation. Ideally, such dissuasion should rely on civil
measures rather than criminal prosecution.        However, it turned out that the political consensus
necessary for this type of breakthrough does not yet exist, and the preparation of the Law was
postponed until next year. This delay i s a set-back, but the silver lining i s that the government
decided to discuss the matter further, rather than adopting a revised law that does not address any of
the concerns.

53.      On the positive side, in relation to the environment trigger, there has been progress beyond
the adoption of the National Targeted Program (NTP) for Climate Change and assignment of
institutional responsibilities.    The NTP was approved in December 2008, and implementation
arrangements are underway. Implementing this NTP requires inter-ministerial coordination, which i s
always a difficult task in the Vietnamese administration. The relevant ministries have grasped the
importance and urgency of tackling the potential effects of climate change, and their diligence and
commitment to reforms are to be commended.

54.      The view of the Task Team i s that the performance under this operation does not reflect a
weak commitment of the government to reform. While there are nuances in the assessment of the
triggers across co-financiers, and various interpretations can be offered for the overall slowdown in


                                                    14

policy performance, there is a determination of the donor community to remain engaged in the
dialogue with the government over economic reforms.

55.      In addition to assessingthe triggers, the technical meetings with the government provide the
platform to engage in a broader dialogue. Progress in the implementation of the reform agenda i s
assessed on an annual basis through the adoption of a series of benchmarks, reflected in the policy
matrix of each of the PRSC operations. For a measure to be considered a benchmark, it needs to meet
four criteria. First, it needs to be explicitly mentioned in the SEDP 2006-2010 or be part of some
other strategic policy document of the government. Second, the measure has to be considered in the
VDR series or inother analytical documents as conducive to the attainment of development outcomes.
Third, the measure has to be strategic in importance. And fourth, it has to be monitorable, in the
sense that its completion can be documented.

56.      Over the year elapsed since the last operation in the series, the Government of Vietnam made
progress in its reform agenda, across all policy areas. The benchmarks are distributed roughly evenly
inthe four pillars. The triggers andbenchmarks arediscussedbrieflybelow by pillars.

Pillar I.Businessdevelopment

57.      Strengthen financial management of SOEs and their investments in other entities,
defining the level of such investments.           The venturing of Economic Groups and General
Corporations (large groups of SOEs) into asset markets on a large scale fueled the asset bubbles of
2007/8 and contributed to macroeconomic instability. Their investments in banks and other financial
institutions raised the prospect of related-party transactions which could increase the vulnerability of
the economy in the medium term. To address these risks, the government revised the relevant
regulations on the financial management of SOEs. The revisions limit the scope and nature of SOEs'
investment activities outside their main business lines, and especially into banking, insurance and
securities sectors. The revised regulation prevents large SOEs from holding controlling stakes in
banks. It also reduces the scope for conflict of interest by not allowing SOEs to buy stakes of other
businesses whose managers or owners have bloodrelationships with those SOEs' leaders.

58.      Prepare the revised Law on SBV focusing its mandate on and enhancing its autonomy in
regard to monetary policy and financial sector stability. One of the main buildingblocks of the
comprehensive roadmap for the banking sector reform, endorsed under PRSC 5, i s the transformation
of the SBV into a modem central bank. It i s to be achieved through the adoption of a revised SBV
Law. The revised Law gives technical autonomy to the SBV, and clarifies SBV's mandate in the
conduct of monetary policy and the supervision of the banking sector. It i s expected to be submitted
to the National Assembly for discussion during the spring session of 2009, and for approval in May
2010. The draft still contains elements that could be improved further, but moves largely inthe right
direction. Overheating of the economy in 2008 caused the delay in processing the Law, as the SBV
was preoccupied in fighting the macroeconomic instability. However, SBV has moved to strengthen
the supervision of the banking sector without waiting for the revised Law. The Credit Institution
Law, another of the building blocks, i s to be processed at the same time as the SBV Law. Parallel
processing i s considered useful in harmonizing the related laws, to ensure efficiency and to avoid
overlaps and gaps.

Vote: The prior actions listed in this table are those included in the Financing Agreement for the proposed
       operation. The complete set of prior actions agreed upon between government and development partners
       for PRSC8 can be found in Annex 5.


59.      Adopt a pricing system for electricity from renewable energy and provide incentives for
government procurement of energy-efficient equipment. Coping with rapid growth in the demand
for electricity i s one of the main infrastructure challenges currently faced by Vietnam. Organizing a
market for electricity and making large investments in generation, by both public and private sectors,
will be critical to increasing the supply of electricity. It i s also clear that electricity could be used
more efficiently and the increase in generation capacity should not come at the expense of the
environment. In July 2008, the Regulations on Avoided Cost and Standardized Power Purchase
Agreement for Renewable Energy Small Power Producers was approved by the MOIT, and came into
effect on January 1, 2009. The tariff under this regime was calculated based on the system marginal
thermal unit (a notional Combined Cycle Gust Turbine (CCGT) calculated from the weighted average
of all CCGTs), and therefore, i s a cost-recovery tariff without subsidies. The new tariff table for 2009
under the new regime was adopted on December 24,2008.

60.      In addition to the three prior actions discussed above, the dialogue in the business
development pillar also addressed diverse issues in the areas of global integration, financial sector
reform, private sector development, and infrastructure. Inthe area of global integration, a framework
for implementing the policies following the WTO accession was approved. On strengthening the


                                                      16

financial sector to adapt to the new global environment, monitoring of indirect investment flows was
strengthened, and contingency plans to address possible adverse effects of the global financial crisis
on the banking sector were carried out. To promote private sector development, regulations were
issued to reformagriculture research, and to nurtureSMEs. Ininfrastructure, improving traffic safety
was sought through a new RoadLaw and its implementation.

Pillar 11. Social Inclusion

61.      Formulate education development strategy to 2020 focusing on equity of learning
outcomes and relevance of contents. While past strategic documents have focused on different sub-
sectors within education, this strategy represents a comprehensive and integrated approach to
planning across the education sector, from early child education to higher education. Given the
progress accomplished in extending the coverage of primary and lower secondary education in
Vietnam, the strategy reflects a concern to ensure that education opportunities are distributed
equitably across the youth population in a society where disadvantage i s characterized by poverty,
geographic remoteness and ethnic minority status. It also reflects the increased importance placed on
the quality of learning outcomes at all levels of the education system and on the relevance of training
offered in vocational, technical, professional, and higher education. The strategy was developed
through an extensive consultation process, beginning within the Government's education
establishment (via in-house discussions), then including key professional stakeholders (in townhall
meetings) and extending to the broad public (through the Ministry of Education (MOET) website).
Over 700 written comments were received. MOET has received comments from the influential
Politburo. Clearance from the Politburo i s generally the last step in adopting important strategies for
the government. According to MOET, the feedback was broadly supportive of the content, with
guidance to ensure coherence between the overall strategy of the next SEDP and this education
strategy, and to align the period of the education strategy with the new SEDP timeframe (2011-2020).
The strategy will be adopted with the new SEDP in2010.

62.      Prepare a strategic plan to ensure prudential and effective investment of social security
funds. Due to the youth and rapid formalization of the labor force, the old-age pension program of
Vietnam i s quickly accumulating reserves. The expansion of the old-age pension program to the
informal sector, implementedunder the previous operation, should accelerate this trend. The long-run
viability of the program depends on the soundness of the investments made with the contributions
from workers and employers. The record so far i s not reassuring, as VSS agency has invested in low-
return assets, in accordance with the Social Insurance Law. During the proposed operation, VSS
formulated a strategic plan to identify potential investments, develop an investment portfolio, choose
forms of investment, and decide on the share of different asset classes. The process included
identifying appropriate benchmarks, with priority given to security over profitability. Based on the
plan, recommendations will be made to expand the list of asset classes considered in the Social
Insurance Law. Although the latest draft contains elements that can be strengthened further, it i s
considered a breakthrough achievement, as it fundamentally alters the way VSS manages its
investments. The latest draft has been submitted for comments to VSS's Governing Board, which i s
the beginning of the approval process. Even though the trigger as it was originally formulated has not
been fully met, the Team deems that there has been sufficient progress towards achieving it.

63.     Inaddition to the two prior actions discussed above, the dialogue inthe social inclusion pillar
also covered discussions in health and promoting gender equality. Inthe health sector, the treatment
of medical waste was strengthened. On gender equality, the dialogue focused on making operational
the Laws on Anti-Domestic Violence and on Gender Equality by adopting an action plan and issuing
guidingregulations.

Pillar 111. Natural Resource Management

64.      Approve the National Targeted Program on Adaptation to Climate Change and allocate
institutional responsibilities for its implementation. Vietnam is one of the countries that would be
most severely affected by the rise in the sea level as a result of climate change. Due to its long coast
line and highpopulation density, it i s also particularly vulnerable to floods and typhoons, which can
also be expected to become more common. Realizing these challenges, the government decided to
embark early on in the preparation of a plan for adaptation to climate change. Led by MONRE, a
NTP was approved under this operation.          This plan assigns responsibilities to line ministries,
government agencies and provincial authorities, so as to avoid duplication and overlaps. MONRE,
the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) are now making
financial and institutional arrangements to implement the NTP.

65.      Inaddition to the prior condition discussed above, the dialogue inthe naturalresources pillar
also addressed issues inthe areas of land and forests, water, and the environment. Inland and forests,
there was progress in transferring land owned by SFEs to local communities. In water sector, the
irrigation service for poor farmers was reformed, as the government was interested in providing
support to this group to mitigate potential negative impacts from the WTO accession. Following up
on an itemcarried over from PRSC 7, institutional responsibilities were allocated to develop a unified
national sanitation strategy. A national action plan for personal hygiene, safe water, and environment
sanitation was developed, and regulation on private sector participation in rural water supply was
issued. Inthe area of protecting the environment, management of sewerage and drainage services was
reformed, and biodiversity protection law was issued.

Pillar IV. Modern Governance

66.      Formulate Public Debt Management Law consolidating the management of domestic
and external debt. Muchprogress has been made inpublic financial management reform. The State
Budget Law, passed in 2002, transformed fundamentally the expenditure side, whereas the tax reform
strategy currently under implementation i s modernizing both tax instruments and tax administration.
Less progress has been accomplished in relation to the management of public assets and liabilities.
An important milestone in this direction is the Law on Public Debt. This Law creates a dedicated
debt department in MOF, consolidates the management of domestic and external debt to a large extent
under this department, and strengthens the information sharing among different ministries who have
roles in managing debt for historical reasons. Even if incomplete, such consolidation i s important to
Vietnam when the economy i s integrating into the world, and buying and selling of government bonds
become a critical ingredient in conducting macroeconomic policy. The Law has been submittedto the
National Assembly. The Law i s expected to be approved in the Spring 2009 session, and to become
effective on January 1, 2010.

67.      Establish the National Bar Association (NBA), with governing documents and structures
approved by the community of lawyers. This trigger i s based on the Judicial Reform Strategy to
2020, which refers to the need of creating favorable legal conditions to promote the self-management
status of lawyers' organizations, while enhancing their responsibility towards their members. The
trigger i s considered important to build institutional momentum for further legal and judicial reform.
It is expected that self-management by the NBA will bring new dynamics for the profession by
buildingcompetencies and providing training, establishing standards for quality of legal services, and
demanding stronger administration of justice and overall respect for the rule of law. Regional
seminars have been held to disseminate election rules for the constitutional congress of the new NBA,
and provincial bars have discussed the draft charter.          Representatives for all provincial bar
associations have been elected for the constitutional congress. A first National Congress was held in
May 2009, which adopted the governing documents, including the charter and code of conduct.



                                                    18

68.      Inaddition to the two prior actions discussed above, the dialogue inmodern governance pillar
also included discussions in the areas of planning processes, public financial management, legal
development, public administration reform, and fighting corruption.              There was a revision of
investment laws and promotion of participation and result-based approach in the planning process.
There was also progress in introducing the modern treasury and budget management system, and
improving the state audit planning.          In legal development, civil judgment executions were
strengthened.     In public administration reform, administrative procedures were simplified and
principles of merit-orientation in civil service management were adopted. A comprehensive anti-
corruption strategy was adopted to improve governance.

Triggers for PRSC 9

69.      Duringthe negotiation of the proposed credit, an agreement was reached on a list of measures
that will in principle be supported by PRSC 9. These measures are grounded in the SEDP and other
key documents and strategies that reflect measures to mitigate the impacts of the global economic
crisis. The list also builds on the progress made in the policy dialogue with government over the
current PRSC cycle. The set of measures are chosen because of their strategic importance to attain
the development objectives of the SEDP towards the end of the five-year cycle. They should not be
interpreted as conditions, but as a guide to focus the policy dialogue during the next 12 months.
Progress towards meeting the triggers will be assessed in the second half of 2009 in order to launch
the formal preparation of the next operation inthe series.

70.      Adopt regulation on State-owned Economic Groups for better corporate governance,
exercising of the state-ownership rights, and supervision. The MPIi s drafting a decree regulating
State-owned Economic Groups, which will be an important element in SOE reforms. It i s expected to
strengthen separation between the regulator and the entity that exercises the ownership rights,
improve corporate governance of the SOEs, and introduce market discipline inrunningthese entities.

71.      Revise regulations to better assess commercial banks' portfolio risks, enhance public
disclosure, and strengthen supervision. The revision of Decision 493 (on loan classification and
provisioning), Decision 457 (on prudential ratios), and the Law on Credit Institutions are expected
during PRSC9 period. The changes will help: (i)better assess the quality of assets and financial
health of the banks; (ii)improve disclosure to public of financial results; and (iii)  enhance supervision
of credit institutions.

72.      Produce cost estimates and conduct public consultation on full-day schooling for
primary education. For primary education, one of the most pressing and compelling issues facing
Vietnam i s full-day schooling. The government i s committed to this agenda, and it i s important to
bringto the forefront the implications that it will have. Producing cost estimates is a pre-requisite for
the development of a full-day schooling roadmap.

73.      Adopt national standards and establish a unified licensing system for health care
practitioners. The Ministry of Health (MOH) plans to adopt the national standards through a
ministerial circular, to become effective by January 2010. The most suitable certification model for
Vietnam i s still being debated. It i s expected that the certification will not only cover doctors who are
managers in private hospitals (as currently), but also be extended to all health care practitioners, both
public and private. Advisory Boards at central and provincial levels will be established. M O H also
plans to establish a unified licensing system for central to provincial levels, with the mandate of
certifying health practitioners.       The system will strengthen the technical quality of health
practitioners, thus, to ensure the quality of service delivery. The standards and system are expected to
be consistent with the Law on Examination and Treatment, which is expected to be adopted by the
NationalAssembly by end 2009, but ifnecessary, MOHwill prepare a revised regulation by May 2010.

 74.      Establishindicators, identify gaps, and adopt a plan to address them in monitoring of
 gender equality in priority areas. This trigger is a pre-requisite for effective implementation of the
 Gender Equality Law and its decree on measures to ensure gender equality which i s under
 preparation. MOLISA has issued a plan to re-organize/ reunite the current National Committee for
 the Advancement of Women (NCFAW) network at the local levels (currently under the MPI and the
 Vietnam Women's Union (VWU)) in 2009 and 2010 which could be a reliable resource for data on
 gender equality at local levels. The priority areas are poverty reduction, labor, and land-use rights
 certificates. Progress i s also expected in the areas of social services and women's representation in
 administrative agencies.

                                                    having                       extension of the NTP11,
or (iii) a new national RWSS program. MARD (possibly in cooperation with MOH, MOET
        having
and the Ministry of Construction (MOC)) i s expected to develop a plan to undertake an RWSS
program after 2010 as an expansion of NTP II,which focuses on sanitation and addresses personal
hygiene to ensure that by 2015 Vietnam will achieve the Millennium Development Goal in water
supply and sanitation. In addition to this, many of the issues which are relevant and important for the
rural water and sanitation such as rural sanitation, drinking water quality, RWSS Operation and
Maintenance (O&M) and privatization, will be discussed during the process of developing such a
BeyondNTP11program.

76.      Issue guidelines for efficient use of water resources to accompany the irrigation services
fee waiver policy. A regulation (Decree 115/2008/ND-CP) was issued in 2008 to provide financial
relief to poor farmers through a policy of irrigation services fee waiver. There i s a concern, however,
that this policy reduces farmers' perception of the economic value of irrigation water and water
services and diminishes incentives to conserve water. A situation of water scarcity already exists in
some crucial river basins, and irrigation i s the largest user of water resources. Therefore, guidelines
for water use efficiency would be important in implementing the Decree 115. MARDi s to issue these
technical guidelines, to complement the Circular 36 issued by the MOF, which provides financial
guidelines.

77.      Formulate regulation for internal audit development and implementation, defining
organizational responsibilities. Progress in internal audit was included one of the most urgent
reforms inthe latest CFAAjointly prepared by the government and donors. This issue becomes more
important if the government intends to decentralize further to the local levels. The legal framework
on internal audit i s weak with no clear definition of the concept, scope and nature of internal auditing
and its role in the internal control framework of the government. Without legal clarity, agencies are
hesitant in establishing and operating an internal audit function. In the meantime, there i s a need to
review the responsibilities for directing internal auditing in the public sector between MOF and the
State Audit of Vietnam (SAV). SAV i s chairing the preparation of a decree on organization and
operation of internal audit, which i s now inits first draft.

78.      Enhance access to information by the public and specify the mechanisms. The Law on
Access to Information is expected to be submitted to the National Assembly for discussion in May
2010. The Law should increase access to timely and accurate information which is essential to
prevent and detect corruption.      The Law i s expected to enhance access to information by: (i)
stipulating types of information made public; (ii)     specifying the mechanisms to access information,
including automatic disclosure and disclosure upon requests; and (iii)     outlining responsibilities for
oversight and monitoring access to information.

79.      Issue regulations and approve pilot schemes to strengthen competition, merit-
orientation, and transparency inthe recruitment, appointment, and promotion of civil servants.
The Law on Civil Servants, adopted by the National Assembly in November 2008, i s a major step
towards improved quality of civil service. The Prime Minister's Decision 365 of March 2009 adopts
an action plan for the implementation of the Law. The plan instructs issuance of 11implementing
decrees and development of three proposals on piloting new human resource policies. This trigger i s
expected to achieve: (i)development of implementation decrees; (ii)         introduction of new human
resource policies; and (iii)approval of pilot programs specifying institutional arrangements,
mechanisms, duration, and resources.

80.      Carry out annual procurement compliance and performance audits and make public the
findings, adopt a procurement code of ethics for participants, and launch an open access
electronic bidding system. With the establishment of the Law on Procurement in April 2006, the
Government of Vietnam has been trying to ensure compliance by procuring entities and improve

efficiency in the procurement process of public investment. A sound public procurement system i s
also a key element in the context of fairness while preventing corruption. It i s critical that there i s
increased efficiency, transparency, fairness, and accountability in the procurement process of public
investment inorder to foster the confidence of the public ingovernment institutions.



I                             Box 1.Good PracticePrinciplesfor Conditionality

  Stakeholder consultations were held in February 2009 in Hanoi in the context o f 2009 Development Policy
  Lending Retrospective, conducted by the Operations Policy and Country Services Department of the World
  Bank.

  Ownership. There is general agreement across the stakeholder groups that the PRSC series have been
  firmly rooted in the Government's own reform agenda, as expressed first through the CPRGS and then the
  SEDP. Inboth the donor and NGOconsultations, participants mentioned that this was "best practice."

  Harmonization. Alignment to the CPRGS and the SEDP helped development partners work more
  coherently in support of government outcomes.              There was general acknowledgement that the PRSC
  operation was a complex one, bringing together multiple ministries and donors. Government participants
  were particularly appreciative o f donor efforts to coordinate assistance around the SEDP and PRSC. There
  was still concern over the current framework for accountability, i.e. the PRSC framework being similar, but
  not identical, to the SEDP monitoring framework. There were views that donors should resist the temptation
  to use independent monitoring mechanisms. Inputs from NGOs emphasized how accountability works in
  practice, outlining the need to engage alternative and independent viewpoints. Donors also emphasized how
  harmonization could be improved, suggesting a more structured approach to engagement in the PRSC
  process. This would enable "newcomers" to the process (which grows annually in terms o f number of
  participants) to understand better their roles and obligations.

  Customization. The general sense was that the process had become increasingly tailored to the country
  priorities. The need to balance the wish to promote desirable reforms and the respect for the country's
  priorities, perhaps described as "the art of the possible," was recognized. A repetitive theme refers to
  building the analytical capacity within the Government, so that the Government, rather than development
  partners, can lead the process of determining which actions should be prioritized in the agreements.
  Currently the prioritization and sequencing of actions and triggers was undertaken more by donors than by
  the Government, although the Government owns the broad agenda from which the PRSC operations are
  derived.

  Criticality. The size of the policy matrices was kept minimumcompatible with an active policy dialogue
  across the reform agenda. A multi-sector, multi-agency, multi-donor operation i s likely to need a spread of
  "benchmarks" in order to keep the operation inclusive and motivating for all participants. While this number
  i s higher than in other countries, this i s justified in Vietnam, given the breadth o f its reform program and the
  maturity reached by the PRSC process. With two dozen line ministries and government agencies and a
  dozen co-financiers, drastically narrowing the focus of the policy dialogue, concentrating on just a few
  policy actions would amount to demobilizing a large portion of the constituency for economic reform. The
  Bank and all co-financiers use the same policy matrix to decide on their level of support, thereby providing a
  single harmonized platformfor the policy dialogue and disbursements.

  Transparency and predictability. Both predictability and transparency had increased over recent years.
  The PRSC process has led to disbursements to the budget on an annual basis, thus meeting the objective of
  aligning aid to domestic budget cycles. Since PRSC 2, commitments were made in June of each year, which
  is the time when the preparation of the budget starts. The budget is approved by the National Assembly
  towards November, for the following calendar year. The submission to the National Assembly already factors
  in the amount of resources expected from PRSCs. Although the World Bank inputs were predictable, there
  was less predictability over the timing and level of co-financier resources that would be available. Not all
  donors were able to commit to financing beyond the current years and as levels o f co-financing increase, this
  adds an element of uncertainty into the operation.

                           VI.    OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION


POVERTYAND SOCIALIMPACTS

81.      The reforms supported by the PRSC series have led to a fundamental transformation of the
Vietnamese economy, including increasing reliance on market mechanisms and growing integration
into the world economy. Vietnam's rapid economic growth i s a testimony to the soundness of the
program. This rapid transformation, however, i s bound to have large social impacts: greater economic
fluctuations from increased integration with world markets, potential financial instability due to
exposure to capital flows, growing inequality as agglomeration effects play out and the economic
hubs of the country sail ahead, and possible vulnerabilities as market mechanisms develop throughout
the social sectors. The PRSC operations address these concerns through various measures such as
strengthening and extending the coverage of the pension programs and health insurance, taking
measures to improve the stability of the banking sector, and improving the monitoring of capital
flows, and developing policies to mitigate potential adverse effects of integration.

82.      There are winners and losers in any reformprocess and the reforms supported by this series of
PRSCs seek to maximize the number of families and individuals who participate in Vietnam's
economic transformation and mitigate the harmful effects.        The country's rapid rate of poverty
reductionbears witness their success. However, some groups may benefit less or insome cases suffer
adverse impacts. In cases where the reform program affects identifiable groups, the PRSC support
measures to offset adverse impacts. As tuition fees for secondary and tertiary levels were increased to
ensure better quality service, scholarship programs for the poor were enhanced. In the health sector,
subsidies to cover the insurance premium for the poor and near poor were increased. The issues
relating to environmental protection and pollution control were discussed as a priority, as the poor are
generally the first to suffer from deteriorating conditions. A fee waiver policy for poor farmers was
developed, to provide relief to poor farmers who may be adversely affectedby the WTO accession.

83.      Assessing the wider social impacts of a transformation of this magnitude i s challenging.
Good tools exist to assess the consequences of trade liberalization, an import`ant component in earlier
phases of the PRSC cycle. However a retrospective assessment of the studies conducted at the time
concludes that they were not able to foresee the actual consequences. In a similar vein, more recent
attempts to identify ex ante who wins and loses from the WTO accession have proven inconclusive.
The WTO accession matters because it brings competition in services, raises standards or increases
financial openness, and none of this can be easily captured with the tools at disposal. A review of a
dozen studies based on computable general equilibrium models and almost as many sectoral studies
(reported in VDR 2006 Doing Business) shows that few results are robust across the studies,
suggesting a high sensitivity to the methodology and assumptions used. To fill this gap, increasing
emphasis has been put on monitoring and evaluation in all areas of the program (linked to the
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework in the SEDP) and the team recently completed a
broader review of social protection issues (VDR 2007 Social Protection).

84.      The Social Protection VDR updates Vietnam's poverty assessment. It identifies the main
shifts and shocks being faced by the Vietnamese economy through a period of fundamental
transformation, rather than dealing with potentially adverse impacts on a policy- by- policy basis.
Identifying the right policy responses i s also challenging. In many other parts of the world, cash
transfers (conditional or otherwise) are seen as a clean tool to achieve compensation and enforce the
Pareto principle. However, Vietnam makes limited use of cash transfers. This i s partly due to
implementation issues: handing over cash i s fraught with fiduciary risk, as shown by a recent attempt
to make one-time payments (so-called Tet bonuses) to poor households so as to offset the economic
downturn. There have been numerous reports of misuse of these funds and there i s little evidence that
Tet bonuses have helped to offset the emerging consequences of the recent economic downturn.

                                                  23

More generally, there i s a concern about the dependence created by cash transfers, and a vision that
resources should be better used by promoting the participation of the poor and near-poor in universal
programs, or increasing spending on local infrastructure and services inpoorer regions of the country.
In terms of the former, households classified as "poor" according to criteria developed by MOLISA
are eligible for social services that would otherwise have a cost (e.g. exemption of school fees,
payment of health insurance premium, access to credit without collateral). Community development
programs like Program135 and the recently initiated 61 Poor Districts Program are examples of the
latter.

85.      The PRSC cycle, and the proposed operation in particular, builds on this approach through
specific measures to improve the design and implementation of universal programs, further develop
the information base for identification of beneficiaries, and strengthen public financial management
and accountability so that resources can be channeled and used effectively.          Under the Social
Inclusion Pillar, key policy actions are included for education, health, and social security, with
particular focus on ensuring equity of learning outcomes and the relevance of curriculum in the
education sector, also making sure that all children, including those from the most disadvantaged
groups, have access to full day schooling at the primary level. Governance module included in the
Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS), and attempts to establish indicators and
identify data sources in the area of gender equality, all contribute to the overall efforts of improved
monitoring and evaluation. In the area of public financial management reforms, a modem system to
manage the Treasury and state budget i s beingintroduced, auditing of state budget execution i s being
improved, and inthe future operations (PRSCs 9-10), procurement reforms will also be tackled.

86.     Inaddition to specific measuresinthe policy matrix, efforts rely on arange of analytical work
and TA implementedinclose cooperation with specific ministries, local research institutes attached to
these ministries, and academia. The World Bank has an ongoing program of capacity building and
technical assistance with the GSO, which supports regular conducting of the VHLSSs (VHLSS 2002,
2004, 2006, and 2008) and relatedpoverty assessments. Recent support to GSO focuses on improving
the system for collecting price data and calculating regional cost-of-living indices for better poverty
measurement, and on supporting quarterly Labor Force Surveys (LFS) to monitor the emerging labor
impacts of the global financial crisis. TA i s also provided to ILSSA, the research institute that
supports MOLISA, to streamline and ensure greater consistency in the system used to determine
which households are categorized as poor and thus receive fee exceptions and other services. Social
protection units inMOLISA also receive TA for capacity building, and additional support i s provided
for nuts and bolts of modem social protection, including social security reform. Inaddition to policy
actions includedinthe PRSC operations, a social security reformcredit i s under preparation.

87.     Inparallel to the fundamental social transformations fromrapidgrowth, reforms inPRSC 8,
and the PRSC cycle more generally, will come under pressure from increased economic turbulence.
Overheating in the late 2007 and ripple effects of the global financial crisis starting in 2008 are
examples of consequences of being more open to the rest of the world. Social impacts of the global
economic slowdown are still emerging and it i s important to monitor these carefully over the coming
months. The World Bank is working along three lines to address these issues: first, strengthening
core statistical systems and scaling them up to respond to the information needs of the policy process;
second, making creative use of existing information (e.g. administrative data and other sources) to
assess immediate impacts in key sectors and; third, supporting complementary rapid assessments and
identifying emerging areas of concern. In addition to the ongoing support to the GSO, the World
Bank i s working with the Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences (VASS) and Oxfam Great Britain to
implement a series of rapid assessments focusing on workers and firms. It i s also working with the
MPIto builda database and to initiate regular monitoring of firms inVietnam's Industrial Parks (Ips)
and Economic Zones (EZs). The World Bank also supports one-off exercises to assess employment
vacancies in major urban areas, and changes in levels of international migration. Early results from
recent rapid assessments suggest that informal sector and migrant workers in urban areas have been

                                                  24

particularly hard hit by the economic slowdown. Many migrant workers have returned to rural
"sending" communities, but assessments suggest that rural areas may be hard-pressed to absorb the
extra labor. VASS has distributedinitial findings to the National Assembly and has provided several
in-depth briefings to members.

88.     The findings of ongoing work on impacts of the economic slowdown will feed into the policy
dialogue for PRSC 9, especially as the first matrix i s compiled in September, and initial discussions
take place with the government and PRSC stakeholders.

ENVIRONMENTALASPECTS

89.     The proposed operation is likely to have.overal1 positive effects on the environment, forests,
and other natural resources. The Task Team carried out an analysis4, as required under Operations
Policy 8.60, to determine if there are significant effects on the country's environment, forests, and
other natural resources. "Significant effects" are defined inthe Toolkit as "environmental changes of
sufficient magnitude, duration, and intensity as to have non-negligible effects on the natural resource
base and on human welfare."

90.     A number of policy actions raised at least the theoreticalpossibility of negative environmental
impacts. Such potential impacts have been reviewed carefully by the Bank as part of the preparation
of related lending operations. For example, an Environmental Assessment was carried out in 2008
under the System Efficiency Improvement, Equitization and Renewable Project (P066396). Such
works discount the possibility of any likely negative impacts from any of the policy actions (see table
below).

91.     There are a number of environmental policy actions that are included precisely with the
objective of generating a significant positive environmental impact. Others, while not being strictly
environmental, are also expected to result inpositive environmental externalities. The following table
provides summary information on these triggers and policy actions, the intended positive impacts, and
an analysis of status (likelihood of achievement and actions being taken or to be taken to enhance
likelihood of a significant impact). Policy actions that are considered to be positively significant for
the environment are in bold. Other policy actions are not likely to generate significant positive
impacts either because their implementation is slow or off-track or the environmental impacts of the
policy are minor.

IMPLEMENTATION,MONITORING AND EVALUATION

92.      The PRSC operations have been included in a number of evaluations of budget support
operations, policy lending, and application of good principles in conditionality. A Quality at Entry
Assessment (QEA) for the first PRSC cycle was conducted shortly after the approval of PRSC 2. The
QEA rated the proposed series as highly satisfactory in terms of its strategic relevance and approach
and to its poverty reduction and social inclusion aspects. All other dimensions were considered
satisfactory. A review of Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) by the Independent Evaluation
Group (IEG) reached similar conclusions. Based on the relevance and achievements under most
objectives, the overall outcome of the first PRSC cycle was rated satisfactory. Another assessment
was conducted after PRSC 4, as a part of a broader evaluation of general budget support,
commissioned by 24 donors and conducted by the University of Birminghamin seven countries. This
assessment showcased Vietnam as a successful example of government-donor collaboration, with
strong impact on policies. The assessment for Vietnam was updated after PRSC 5 by the same
research team, by then working in a consulting firm (Mokoro).        This update was financed by the
World Bank as an input for the preparation of the current PRSC cycle. The updated assessment
concluded that PRSCs were effective at supporting policy reforms, at linking policy and budgets, at
strengthening financial management, and at helping harmonization. The inclusiveness of process was
highly valued. At the same time, PRSC operations were judged less effective at supporting policy
breakthroughs and at helping policy implementation. Two more evaluations are ongoing at present,
both at the global level. One of them i s by IEG, and its findings will soon be submittedto the Board.
The other i s conducted by the World Bank for 2009 Development Policy Retrospective. In this
context, consultations with major stakeholders were conducted inHanoi inFebruary 2009.

93.      Progress in the implementation of the reformagenda in the PRSCs 6-10 i s monitored through
a set of development indicators, as described in the Program Document for PRSC 6 (2007). The
indicators were chosen based on the monitoring framework for the SEDP, but they are fewer in
number.     In the case of governance, the set of indicators goes beyond the SEDP monitoring
framework.     This was an area where the experience in monitoring was limited, and the use of
enterprise and household surveys, as opposed to administrative self-reporting, was not yet common.
At the beginning of this PRSC cycle, it was deemed impractical to monitor the progress towards
development outcomes on an annual basis because collecting and processing survey data take time,
and policy reforms are unlikely to yield outcomes immediately. The Executive Board approved that
the assessments be done twice during this PRSC cycle, towards the middle of the cycle and at the end
of it.

94.      This year being the middle of the cycle, a midterm review of the progress towards
development outcomes i s conducted alongside the preparation of PRSC 8. PRSCs are designed to be
holistic, as the channels through which outcomes can be produced are diverse, and causes and effects
do not always have a linear one-to-one relationship. As such, this review does not attempt to dissect
which policy action led to progress in which indicators, but give a global view of the progress made in
attaining the targets define at the outset of this SEDP and PRSC cycle.

95.      Overall progress towards achieving the development outcomes has been impressive (see
Annex 3).      Setting out a five-year framework to monitor progress quantitatively i s itself an
accomplishment for a developing country.           Even though data availability i s still an issue, the
government has made efforts to switch from administrative reporting to statistical and survey-based
monitoring and evaluation. And in the areas that data are already available, many have made strides
towards achieving the targets.

96.      At the time of writing, 12 indicators are still missing out of 51. The missing data can be
classified into two groups. The first group has conceptual issues on what constitutes the indicator.



                                                    27

The second group has well-defined indicators, but they have not been updated since the benchmarking
exercise or have stale updates.

97.      The first group includes client satisfaction with customs, people living in urban slums, the
quality of surface water and air, and extent of unreportedpublic expenditure. Inthe first two, how the
baseline figures were constructed i s not clear. Preparations for a new client satisfaction survey for
customs service users are underway, but the results will not be available until 2001, and it is not clear
that they will be comparable to the benchmark figure. The VHLSS 2008 will have information on
people living in slums, but again, the comparability with the benchmark figure i s questionable. The
last three indicators were under development when PRSC 6 was presented to the Board in 2007. The
public financial management indicator, it was expected that a Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) exercise would have taken place in time for a midterm review, so that the
quantitative indicator can be defined, but it has not been the case. A workshop i s planned in
September 2009 to discuss how to develop good indicators that can be followed systematically over
time. The counterparts for these indicators are MONRE, the Vietnam Environmental Protection
Agency (VEPA), and the MOF.

98.      Many indicators in the second group of missinginformation and some of the stale information
will be updated when the results of VHLSS 2008 and Enterprise Survey become available. They were
conducted in 2008, and their results are expected to be released in the second half of 2009. Twelve
indicators depend on the results of the VHLSS, and three depend on the investment climate module of
the Enterprise Survey. The investment climate module inthe 2008 survey was not identical to the one
used in the 2006, so some data comparability issues may arise. Some of the indicators in the second
group relate to administrative information, which i s still being collected. More information on three
of them i s expected to become available between now and the Board presentation. The indicators
concerned are SOE performance, provinces adopting modern planning, and provincial departments
with one-stop shop.

99.      Among the 39 indicators for which updated figures are available, the progress i s encouraging.
Twenty-nine indicators have made strides towards achieving the targets, seven of which have already
attained the goals. These seven are: (a) export orientation; (b) quality of loan portfolio inthe banking
sector; (c) private domestic investment; (d) learning outcomes inprimary school; (e) river basins with
inter-provincial management; (0 share of debt in GDP; and (g) fraction of civil judgments enforced.
Of the ten indicators that have still ways to achieving the targets, there i s no quantifiable progress in
six: (i)share of strategic investors' ownership in SOCBs; (ii)       proportion of children stunted or
underweight; (iii)  protection of biodiversity; (iv) provincial screening of, public investment; (v)
adoption of integrated regional planning; and (vi) public agencies with internal auditing functions.
Four indicators are showing mixed results or deterioration: (1) stock market capitalization; (2) private
enterprises away from the growth centers; (3) share of female delegates inthe National Assembly; and
(4) forest quality.

100.    ,Whether the targets set out at the beginning have already been achieved or not obviously
depends on how ambitious the targets were and the nature of the indicators. For example, some
indicators tend to make linear progress while others might have a J curve or a step-function.
Therefore, the fact that they are already achieved should not be a reason for complacency, nor should
slow progress be deplored without examining the reasons. Of the ten lagging indicators, two are due
to market conditions, many are due to the slow nature of progress. The indicators relating to
provincial level reforms are making slower progress than those at the central level, but it i s not clear
how the PRSC process might be able to address this issue more adequately. The deterioration in the
forest quality and lack of progress in internal auditing functions are the two worrisome indicators, and
these are the areas which the design of the PRSCs 9-10 could and shouldbe tailored to address.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

101.     Fiduciary arrangements. The fiduciary risks of the current public financial management
systems (budgeting, accounting, reporting, and auditing) are assessed as moderate. Since the IMF
does not currently have a program in Vietnam, it i s not possible to rely on its assessment of the
control environment of the SBV. However, the enactment of the Audit Law in 2005 helps address the
issues related to audit and accounting arrangements. The Audit Law has established the SAV as an
independent institution reporting to the National Assembly with the Auditor General being appointed
and dismissed by the National Assembly. Audit reports were made public for the first time in 2006.
The SBV is subject to auditing by SAV on an annual basis, but under the current laws, the audited
financial statements and audit reports of SBV are treated as a national secret and are not published.

102.     Deposit account (DA).        To address fiduciary risks in the foreign exchange control
environment, the Borrower will open and maintain a dedicated DA in US dollars for the Borrower's
use once the Credit i s approved by the Board. The DA will form part of the country's official foreign
reserves. An equivalent amount will be credited to an account of the government available to finance
budgeted expenditures. If after deposit in the DA the proceeds of the Credit or any part thereof are
used for ineligible purposes, as defined in the Financing Agreement, the Bank will require the
Borrower to either return that amount to the DA to be used for eligible purposes, or refund the amount
directly to IDA.

103.     The Bank will retain the right to seek an independent audit of the DA established in SBV by
an auditor acceptable to the Bank to seek reassurance on the accuracy of the information relating to
transaction from this account that was provided by the Borrower, including accuracy of exchange rate
conversions; and that funds in this account were not used to finance expenditures excluded under the
Agreement. The Government will furnish to the Bank as soon as available, but in any case not later
than six months after the deposit of the single tranche credit amount into the foreign currency DA, a
certified copy of the audit report, of such scope and in such detail as the Bank shall reasonably
request.

                                                  29

DISBURSEMENTAND AUDITING

104.    Disbursement, reporting and auditing arrangements.             The Credit will follow IDA
disbursement procedures for development policy lending operations, and the Credit proceeds will be
disbursed in compliance with the stipulated release conditions. Various measures have been taken to
ensure that the overall fiduciary policies and institutions are adequate to proceed with support from
IDA and other development partners. Analytical underpinnings for the operation include the 2002
Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR), the 2005 PER-FA and the CFAA (2007).
Disbursement will not be linked to any specific purchases and no procurement requirements will have
to be satisfied.

RISKSAND RISKMITIGATION

105.    The proposed operation i s a vehicle for the World Bank, and the donor community more
broadly, to stay engaged with a client that has delivered an outstanding performance in terms of
economic growth and poverty reduction. It also recognizes the commitment of the government to
pursue and deepen its reform strategy. Active engagement should strengthen the coherence of the
program, especially because the effectiveness of sectoral policy actions hinges on the success of more
fundamental governance reforms in areas such public financial management, public administration
reform and legal and judiciary development. Engagement should also help improve the content of
specific policy actions, to ensure the timeliness of their adoption, and to monitor the impact of the
overall program on broader development outcomes. The value of this engagement i s all the more
important given that this would be the last cycle of general budget support operations in concessional
terms, hence providing an exceptional window for high-level policy access in a country that is not aid
dependent.

106.     At the same time, Vietnam faces new challenges. The country is now confronted with an
unprecedented global financial crisis, although it seems to be faring better than its more export-
dependent neighbors in the region so far, partly due to the strong adjustment it had implemented in
2008 to address the economic overheating resultingfrom massive capital inflows. However, Vietnam
will not be unaffected by the crisis; exports have already slowed down, and 31and remittances from
abroad are expected to decline. The government i s administering a fiscal stimulus package, which
raises challenges both on financing and on implementation. The World Bank intends to assist the
government in implementing the stimulus through both technical advice and financial support. The
global financial crisis had already started unfolding when the preparation of the proposed operation
began, and policy dialogue already incorporates some responses, for example, in relation to the more
efficient use of state capital and in financial sector reform. By providing resources directly to the
budget, the proposed credit should also help the government in mitigating the social impacts of the
economic slowdown.

107.     The risk of balance of payments problem receded since last year, with rapidly shrinkingtrade
deficit and slower capital inflows diminishing the current account deficit from both sides.
International reserves, estimated to be US$23 billion at end 2008 (3.6 months of imports), appear
adequate. In the first quarter of 2009, there was a slight trade surplus, amounting to a small current
account surplus. The authorities are also cautiously moving in the direction of a more flexible
exchange rate regime. The proposed credit contributes to further the integration of Vietnam into the
world economy by supporting a more conducive environment for businesses and financially
sustainable arrangements for infrastructure development. These actions should help increase the
efficiency and competitiveness of Vietnamese firms.

108.    The risk of financial sector turbulence had increased as a result of the asset price bubbles of
late 2007 and early 2008.      While credit risk rating by commercial banks i s not yet up to the
international standards, the SBV has strengthened supervision and tightened prudential rules.
Measured on the basis of quantitative indicators, the share of NPLs has declined since September

                                                   30

2008. An interest rate subsidy scheme introduced as part of the stimulus package has amounted to a
restructuring of enterprise debt incurred duringthe overheating period in2007-08,mitigating possible
deteriorations in bank portfolios. In addition to the policy actions included in this operation, the
World Bank i s also supportingbanking sector reforms through an investment credit and TA.

109.     The risk that governance reforms do not keep pace with rapid developments is probably the
most serious inthe medium term. Cases of corruption and social strife are increasingly relatedto land
zoning and land compensation. Tackling this risk requires rapid progress in transparency at various
levels, from regional planning to infrastructure master plans to land use to appropriate taxation to the
monitoring of assets of the relevant civil servants. This area receives special attention inthe proposed
operation, including the recommendation to increase transparency and ensure competition when the
state equitizes its assets or allocates resources, and several actions to improve transparency in public
administration.

Dear Mr.Zoellick:

         Startingin2001, the World Bankand the donor community havesupportedthe economic

         During this period, our economygew at an annualrate inexcess of 7 percentper year in

at 38 percent in 1998, haddeclinedto lessthan 16percentby 2006, with the trend continuing.
This period has also seen considerrableprogress insocialindicators, withVietnam now being on a

more resilient, allowing us to navigatethis global crisis better than other countriesinthe region,
Our economy registeredapositive, albeit reduced, growth rateinearly 2009. We aremobilizing
resourcesto stimulate domestie:demandso thatpoverty reductioncan continue,andthere are
encouragingsigns that growth isregaining momentum. We remainhowever vigilant ofm y
developments that can leadto economic inst       ty, particularly inthe financial sector, and are
upgradingOUT capacityto conduct effective macroeconomicpolicies.
         We are also determinedto carry on the refom?processthat we launchedwith Doi Moi.
Buildingon the success ofthis process, Vietnam's Socio-EconomicDevelopmentPlan(SEDP)
for 2006-20 10 was approvedby the National Assembly on June 29,2006, InDecember2006, the
SEDP was presentedto the Boardof ExecutiveDirectors of the World Bank.

         A key goal ofthe SEDP is to sustain rapidcconomic growthso that Vietnamcanmove
out of low incomestatusby2010 andlay the foundationsto becomean industrial country by
2020. The SEDPaflirms that rapid growth should go handinhandwith improved sustainability,
andimprovedcompetitivenessoftheeconomy. Importanceis attachedto the quality ofgrowth,
which shouldbelinkedwith poverty reduction, culsuretidevelopment, comprehensivehuman

                         Vietnam-Assessment Letter for the World Bank

Recent Developments and Outlook

1.Vietnam is weathering the global crisis better than many other countries but still has been
adversely affected. In the first quarter of 2009, real GDP growth declined to 3.1 percent (y/y),
mainly owing to a contraction in manufacturing related to waning exports, compounded by a drop in
agriculture due to adverse weather conditions. Moreover, while the current account balance moved to
a surplus, driven by a sharp fall in imports and large gold re-exports, this was more than offset by a
significant weakening incapital flows, and gross reserves declined by $1 billion to $22 billion at end-
March. On the positive side, inflation eased further to 9 percent (y/y) in April due to lower food and
fuel prices.

2. Nevertheless, the period ahead i s expected to be challenging. Real GDP growth i s projected at
around 3% percent for 2009 as a whole with an anticipated recovery in agriculture as well as robust
construction and resilient private consumption supporting economic activity in the face of continued
weak exports. With commodity prices stabilizing, inflation i s likely to moderate further to 5 percent
by end-2009. The current account i s projected to shift to a deficit, as imports pick up following the
recent easing of policies. With capital inflows likely to remain weak, pressures on the balance of
payments are expected to increase.        In addition, banks continue to face a difficult operating
environment, and the economic slowdown i s likely to increase corporate and banking vulnerabilities.
The main downside risk to the outlook is the uncertain global economic environment, which could
weaken Vietnam's growth prospects and capital flows.

Policy Challenges

3. Given this challenging environment, the government will need to strike a careful balance
between growth and stability objectives.             In particular, a greater focus on maintaining
macroeconomic and financial stability will be necessary in the period ahead to preserve the
stabilization gains achieved inthe latter part of 2008.

4. Monetary policy would need to be tightened to ensure external stability. Despite the recent
widening of the trading band, the dong has continued to trade at the weaker end of the band. The
significant easing of monetary policy since the last quarter of 2008, along with the introduction of
interest subsidy schemes, has led to a large increase incredit growth, which could weaken the external
position and add downward pressures on the dong. A tightening of monetary conditions coupled with
a clearer policy communication could help boost confidence in the dong. To be credible, these
measures would have to be supported by a viable fiscal policy. If credit expansion continues to
accelerate and the external position weakens sharply, however, stronger monetary and exchange rate
policy actions may be needed.

5. It will be important that the government adopt a revised fiscal strategy for 2009 that i s
consistent with maintaining macroeconomic stability.           This strategy needs to cover not only
revisions to the original 2009 budget plan but also off-budget expenditures (including stimulus
measures such as the interest subsidy schemes executed by the SBV). In the absence of additional
external financing, an overall fiscal deficit (includingoff-budget expenditure and on-lending) beyond
8% percent of GDP in 2009, which is close to the level of the original budget plan, would be difficult

                                                    61

to finance without crowding out private sector activity, adding pressures on the balance of payments,
and undermining medium-term fiscal sustainability to the extent that stimulus measures are
permanent. Careful consideration of the stimulus package will be needed to limit the deficit to this
level. Some stimulus measuresmay be absorbed by reprioritizing existing spending, but others-such
as tax stimulus measures that are not well-targeted and the interest subsidy schemes-may    need to be
reconsidered.   More generally, the government needs to shift away from measures providing
temporary cash relief to enterprises toward more efficient public investment projects and social safety
net measures aimed at protecting vulnerable groups.

6. Safeguarding banking sector stability remains crucial. While banks so far have managed to
weather the economic downturn, credit risk remains the primary concern. Moreover, the lending rate
cap as well as higher deposit rates and provisioning costs have squeezed banks' profit margins, and
smaller banks continue to face tight liquidity conditions. The SBV should further strengthen bank
supervision, including by ensuring that banks properly assess credit risks and classify loans extended
under the interest subsidy schemes. Going forward, the SBV needs to improve its banking data
reporting system to enhance financial transparency and expedite legal reforms that will strengthen its
operational autonomy and effectiveness in safeguarding the soundness of banks.

7. Improving data provision and communication strategy would help bolster policy credibility.
The quality and timeliness of data-especially in the fiscal, state-owned enterprise, and banking
sectors-need   to be substantially strengthened. The communication strategy could be enhanced by
presenting a regular assessment of the economic situation and direction of policy to the public in a
transparent and consistent manner, in order to manage market expectations more effectively and
improve investor confidence.
