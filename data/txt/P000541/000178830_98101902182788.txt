INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPIENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
PEOPLEtS REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
FOR A RAILWAY PROJECT
1.          I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Republic of the Congo(the Congo), for
the equivalent of US$6.3 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a
railway project.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.          The Bank Group's activities in the Congo (see Annex I) date
back to 1959, before independence, when a loan of US$35.0 million (230-FR),
jointly guaranteed by the Congo, France, and Gabon, was made to Compagnie
Miniere de l'Ogoou6 (COMILOG) to help finance a manganese project. The mine
itself is in Gabon, but the ore is transported by rail through important
forestry areas in the Congo to the Congo-Ocean railroad near Dolisie for
shipment through Pointe Noire (see map attached). The first lending operation
in the Congo after independence was the loan in 1967 of US$30.0 million to
the Compagnie des Potasses du Congo (CPC) (48o-COB) to help finance the
exploitation of potash deposits. This loan has been fully disbursed and the
Executive Directors have been informed in the Secretary's memorandum of
September 21, 1971 (SecM71-456), about the status of the CPC loan and the
serious problems which have been encountered in the execution of the project.
3.         W4ith the exception of the 1971 education project (Credit No.
237-COB) on which progress is satisfactory, Bank Group lending in the Congo
since 1969 has focused on the transport sector. Following preparatory studies
financed under a Bank technical grant of $185,000 in 1966, a highway engi-
neering credit of $630,000 (S-6-COB) was made in 1969 to finance three studies
all of which have been satisfactorily completed wfith a savings of $30,000.
The first of these studies was the feasibility and detailed engineering of
the 40 km Pointe Noire-Bondi road, which led to the $1.5 million credit
(189-COB) in 1970 for the improvement of 35 km of this road. After difficul-
ties in securing tenders at satisfactory prices, the contract was awarded and
construction began in August 1971. Initial problems concerned with the
preparation of withdrawal requests are being resolved; disbursements are
expected to get under way shortly. A re-evaluation of the economic justifi-
cation has shown that, despite the greatly reduced production by the CPC
potash mine which this road serves, the economic rate of return of the project
will remain above 9%. The second study, financed under S-6-COB, led to a
highway maintenance credit of $4.0 million (274-COB) approved on December 1l
and signed on December 22, 1971. This credit will finance the $3.4 million
foreign exchange costs of a four-year highway maintenance program; it will
also refund the $0.6 million outstanding balance of Credit S-6-COB. The third
study financed under 3-6-COB concerns the detailed engineering of the 143 km



- 2 -
Sibiti-Zanaga road. A decision to go ahead with the construction of this
road is sub4ect to the resolution of two major problems: the delay in the
constructior. of the FED-financed road linking Sibiti with the Congo-Ocean
railway (CFCO) at Jacob, and the need to increase the capacity of the rail-
road to Pointe Noire.
4.          The Bank is executing agency for a UNDP feasibility and
preliminary engineering study of the improvement of the mountainous Holle-
Dolisie section (110 km) of the railway, which is the most difficult stretch
of track between Mont Belo and Pointe Noire. Preliminary engineering studies
of an alternative route through this section are on the point of completion
and should be followed without delay by detailed studies. The proposed
project, appraised in May/June 1971, includes these detailed studies and
interim measures to cope with short-term capacity problems. Negotiations
were concluded in wJashington on January 21, 1972. The Congolese delegation
was led by Mkr. Edouard E. Babackas, the General Manager of Agence Trans-
congolaise de Communications (ATC), which operates the CFCO and would be
the beneficiary of the proposed credit.
5.          The credit now proposed reflects the Bank Group's concern with
the development and strengthening of regional transport, notably the road-
river-rail network linking Chad and the Central African Republic with the
Atlantic Ocean at Pointe Noire. This concern has also prompted the Bank
Group to consider, with other aid donors involved in the development of
the Central African region, how to help particularly the land-locked
countries in reducing the cost of transport to and from the sea. A project
designed to improve the efficiency of the Sangha-Oubangui-Congo river
transport system is under preparation. So far as the Congo is concerned,
support for improved transport services will continue to be the cornerstone
of the Bank Group's lending program, given that a good transport system is
essential to future agricultural and forestry development. Agriculture and
forestry will themselves be receiving an increasing amount of Bank Group
attention in the near future (see paras 10 and 13 of the President's Report
on the credit for highway maintenance, dated December 1, 1971). To this
end, a livestock project was appraised last January/February and preparation
is under way for other possible projects in the agriculture sector.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
6.          An economic report entitled "The Economny of the People's Republic
of the Congo - Recent Evolution and Prospects" (A;-26a), dated Nlovember 18,
1971, was circulated to the Executive Directors on December 3, 1971 (see
Annex II for Country Data).
7.          The dominant feature of the Congolese economy is its regional
transport role (see map attached). The greater part of the Transequatorial
Route, a road-river-rail network from Chad through the Central African
Republic to the sea port of Pointe Noire, is located in the Congo; this
route also serves Southeast Cameroon and part of Gabon. Transit traffic
constitutes about 80% of the total traffic at the river port of Brazzavi..lle
and about 64% at Pointe Noire, Congots only sea port. Some 50% of the rail



- 3 -
traffic is also transit. There is at this time no economically justifiable
alternate route for traffic from the CAR, southeastern Cameroon, southern
Chad, and southern Gabon. The capacity of the Transequatorial Route must
be increased in order to improve the flow of transit traffic, to meet the
increasing transport requirements of both national and regional exports of
forest products, and to permit further increases in general economic activity,
The continued ability of ATC to provide reliable and efficient transport
services is thus of crucial importance to the future growth of the Congo's
economy and that of the region.
8.          As stated in the economic report, growth prospects in the Congo
will also depend on the Congo's ability to generate significant public
savings, which requires not only budgetary measures, but the reorganization
and reduction of losses of state enterprises, the improvement of the process
of planning and allocating resources according to a rational set of priori-
ties, the continued attraction of foreign private investment within the
framework of a mixed economy, and the adaptation of education to manpower
needs.
9.          After many years of current budgetary surpluses, the financial
situation of the Government began to deteriorate in 1970. It worsened further
during 1971, although the last half of that year showed some improvement
over the first half. Increasing recurrent expenditures for large public
investments, the inherited problem of an inflated bureaucracy, and large
capital expenditures by state enterprises were the major reasons for large
budgetary deficits. Serious financing problems necessitated the use of all
available treasury resources, including maximum permitted drawings on the
Central Bank, and led to increases in unpaid bills. Declining imports of
capital goods and import-substitution, resulting from the Government's
industrial investment effort(which has now slowed down),have also had a
considerable effect on import duty receipts, one of the Government's most
important sources of revenue. The prospects for increasing the budget reve-
nues are good, as new revenues will be coming in this year from newly
discovered petroleum reserves; production is expected to reach two million
tons in 1973. The Government, however, is aware that it must stabilize its
expenditures, particularly with regard to increases for personnel; additional
measures to increase public revenues may also have to be taken.
10.         In spite of these financial problems, the Congo has better
development prospects than a number of other African countries because of
its endowment with natural resources and the availability of trained man-
power. However, even with a serious effort to generate public savings, the
Congo will have to rely heavily on external assistance to sustain the rate
of growth achieved so far. Based on the Bank's 1971 economic report and
the improved outlook for oil revenue, total public savings for the 1972-76
period are estimated at a maximum of CFAF 16 billion, or 22% of the CFAF 72
billion investments ,which are considered the maximum feasible during this
period.
11.          Given the favorable petroleum and timber export prospects,
assuming the continued inflow of public external capital at the current
level of about CFAF 9 billion a year, and assuming the level of imports
is kept under control, the balance of payments should remain manageable in
the near future. The Congo's creditworthiness is presently constrained by



- 4 -
debt service ratios for direct government borrowings of 12% of merchandise
exports and net service receipts, and almost 10% of government revenues, and,
including government guaranteed debt, of 22% and 20% respectively. Given this
burden of debt, external assistance to the Congo should so far as possible
be on concessionary terms. The limited savings capability of the Congo
at this time requires that external financing should also cover a high pro-
portion of project costs.
12.         The Congolese Government has undertaken a number of nationali-
zations. The status of individual cases remains the same as reported in the
previous President's Report on the Congo dated December 1, 1971, with the
exception of Compagnie G4n4rale de Transports en Afrique Equatoriale (CGTAE)
on which an agreement has now been reached. As for the Societe Industrielle
et Agricole du Niari - Soci6te Sucriere du Niari (SIAN-SOSUNIARI), the
Government has recently advised the Bank that it will resume discussions
with the shareholders. The Bank will continue to follow closely the progress
made in the settlement of investment disputes in the Congo.
PART III - THE PROJECT
13.         The report, "Appraisal of a Railway Project - Congott (PTR - 98a),
dated March 1, 1972 is being circulated to the Executive Directors separately.
A Credit and Project Summary is attached as Annex III.
14.         In 1969 the Congo withdrew from the Agence Transeqquatoriale des
Communications (ATEC), a multi-national transport agency jointly established
with CAR, Chad, and Gabon to operate and maintain the facilities of the
Transequatorial Route. The Government took over the ATEC facilities located
on its territory and set up ATC to run them. ATC enjoys complete financial
autonomy and operates on commercial principles. It is organized in three
self-contained operating sections: the port of Pointe Noire, the CFCO railway
from Pointe Noire to Brazzaville, and the river transport system on the Congo
and Oubangui rivers. It operates transport services to its former ATEC partners
under a series of bilateral agreements which have led to satisfactory coopera-
t'ion.
15.         The CFCO railway provides the basic link between the Atlantic
coast at Pointe Noire, the capital Brazzaville (510 km), the manganese mines
of COMILOG and the river routes which connect with the northern region of
the Congo, southern Cameroon, the Central African Republic, and Chad. The
railway was built at minimum cost between 1922 and 1934 for a foreseen capacity
of some 500,000 tons. In 1970, freight traffic, essentially consisting of logs
and sawn timber, amounted to 1.6 million tons, having doubled in ten years.
Ifith manganese ore, total traffic came to 3.1 million tons, and is estimated
to reach 5.3 million tons in 1975. By more intensive maintenance of track
and equipment, additional freight cars and locomotives, improved braking and
longer passing loops, the capacity of the railway in the critical export
direction could be raised for a short period to about 4 million tons per annum,
just about sufficient to meet the forecast export traffic for 1975.
16.         The feasibility of increasing CFCO's capacity beyond 1975 has
been investigated by Tecsult International of Canada, in association with



Canadian National Railways. As mentioned in para 4 above, these studies have
been financed by the UNDP with the Bank as executing agency. The consultants
have completec. their field work and the draft final report is about to be
issued. A Ban1: review of the consultantst interim report concluded that of
the various s 'utions examined the realignment of the Holle-Fourastie
Section, and oonstruction of a new southern route from Fourasti6 to Moukondo
near Dolisie, to bypass the present tortuous route through the Mayombe
mountain range, is the optimum technical and economic solution. Given the
time required for final engineering, contracting and construction,it is
essential to proceed to final engineering without delay in order to satisfy
traffic requirements from 1975 onwards.
17.         The proposed project comprises the final engineering of the
Holle-Dolisie realignment, including the preparation of tender documents
and interim measures required to increase the capacity of the railroad over
the next two years. The project is part of the CFCOts draft 1971-75 Invest-
ment Plan, prepared by ATC, which envisages a total expenditure of $81.3
millinn over the five-year period on the improvement and renewal of track,
improvement of existing equipment and workshops, the acquisition of new
equipment, and the realignment of the Holle-Dolisie section of the railway.
The realignment would account for about half of the total expenditure under
the plan.
18.         The total estimated cost of the project is $25.1 million, of whici
$20.9 million represents foreign exchange costs. It would be financed by
the proposed IDA credit of $6.3 million (25%), other external borrowings
of $13.5 million (54%) already arranged or under negotiation (see paragraph
21 below), and local borrowings of $1.3 million (5%), with the balance of
$4.0 million (16%) from ATC/CFCO internal cash generation (see Annex III).
19.         The proceeds of the proposed credit would be relent to ATC for
30 years, including a five-year grace period, and at an interest rate of
7 1/4% per annum, and would finance the foreign exchange cost of the follow-
ing project items:
(US$ million)
205 Freight cars, including spare parts            4.0
Holle-Dolisie final engineering                    1.4
Traffic costing and tariff studies                 0.3
Contingencies                                      o.6
6.3
20.         The freight cars to be financed by the Association will be
procured under international competitive bidding. Because the final engineer-
ing of the proposed realignment should follow the feasibility study and
preliminary engineering without interruption, the same consultants (Tecsult)
would be retained to carry out the final engineering. Consultants that ATC
would select in agreement Tith the Association would carry out the traffic



- 6-
costing and tariff study.
21.         ATC, for reasons of standardization, proposes to obtain some
of the other equipment required, including locomotives, railcars, special
timber cars and spares, from previous suppliers in France. To finance these
items, ATC has already secured loans and grants in the amount of $5.1
million equivalent from the French Caisse Centrale de Coop6ration Economique
(CCCE) and Fonds dtAide et de Cooperation (FAC) and an additicnal $6.2
million to finance items required in 1973 is under negotiation. ATC has
also requested a loan of $2.2 million from the African Development Bank,
which is under consideration. External financing, 'including the proposed
credit, wJould amount to 79% of proj3ct cost,
22.         ATC and CFCO are competent to carry out the project. The
General Manager and his principal assistants, and the majority of staff
are Congolese, supported by extensive French technical assistance. The
financial structure of the three autonomous operating sections is self-
contained. Although the surplus of one section may be used to cover the
deficit of another, the three sections each showed surpluses in 1970 and
1971. ATC as a whole had a surplus of about CFAF 700 million in each year,
with a current ratio of 2.6, and a debt equity ratio of 24/76. To maintain
ATC in a sound financial position and to assure an adequate level of cash
generation during the project period, ATO has agreed to increase tariffs
on all sections by an average of 10% by July 1, 1972, and to further adjust
tariffs and take other measures as required to provide revenues sufficient
to cover all administrative ar.d operating expenses, taxes, debt service,
and a reasonable portion of the cost of its capital investments, including
the replacement of assets. The CFCO section is specifically required to
earn at least a 6% financial rate of return on the average net value of its
fixed assets in use in 1973 and at least 5% in subsequent fiscal years.
These rates of return would be subject to review with the Bank Group after
completion of the costing study to be financed under the proposed credit.
ATC would also be subject to a debt limitation.
23.         ATC has given assurances that it would improve its accounting
techniques and that auditors satisfactory to the Association would carry
out the annual audit. ATC will also ensure that satisfactory programs for
the training of professional staff and improving workshop facilities will
be carried out. The Government for its part has given assurances that it
would keep its future accounts lith ATC current and would make best efforts
to settle its outstanding debt as soon as possible.
24.         The project is economically justified and will contribute to
the integrated economic development of the Congo and the neighboring coun-
tries served by ATC. So far as the items to be financed by the Association
are concerned, the rate of return on the rolling stock is about 18%. The
expected economic benefits of the ultimate realignment project are calculated
to yield an internal rate of return of about 40% and therefore justify
undertaking the final engineering. Alternate regional routes can be foreseen
in the long term only; should the COMIILOG traffic be directed to another
route after 1980, the realignment project would still yield an 18% rate of
return. The Government has agreed not to construct any major road between
Pointe Noire and Brazzaville which would duplicate ATC's facilities, without
consultation with the Association.
