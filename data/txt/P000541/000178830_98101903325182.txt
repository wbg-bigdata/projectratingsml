APPRAISAL OF A RAILWAY PROJECT
SUMKARY
i.        This report appraises a project for the Congo-Ocean Railway (CFCO),
with the objective of enabling the railway to satisfy the long-term require-
.umPnts of increased traffic, originated by the development of timber, mineral
and other resources in a vast area of Equatorial Africa. The proposed credit
of US$6.3 million will be the first to the People's Republic of the Congo for
a railway project.
ii.       The CFCO Railway, owned and operated by the Agence Transcongolaise
des Communications (ATC), provides the basic link between the Atlantic coast,
the capital Brazzaville, the manganese mines in Gabon and the river routes
which connect with the northern region of the Congo, southern Cameroon, the
Central African Republic and Chad. ATC is a Congo national agency operated
on a commercial basis with financial autonomy. In addition to the railway,
ATC operates the ocean port of Pointe Noire, as well as river navigation
services. Management is competent; senior experts and training programs
are provided by French technical assistance.
iii.      ATC has drafted a 1971-1975 Investment Plan for the CFCO amounting
to US$81.3 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$58
million. The Plan includes a major improvement and realignment of route for
110 km, required to increase the railway capacity substantially. Approval of
the 1974/1975 section of the Plan is contingent upon a final decision on the
realignment and financial arrangements for its implementation.
iv.       The project comprises a portion of CFCO's 1971-1975 Investment Plan
and is essentially an interim operation, designed to prepare the ground for
a larger project, the proposed major realignment, when full justification is
available at a later date. The cost of the 'resent project is US$25.1 mil-
lion equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$20.9 million and in-
cludes the purchase of rolling stock (45%), track improvements (27%), equip-
ment for rolling stock (19%) and a traffic costing study, together with the
final engineering of the proposed realignment (9%). The feasibility of in-
creasing the CFCO's capacity, including the major realignmenrz, is being in-
vestigated by consultants, 1/ whose services are financed by the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP), with the Bank as executing agency.  A
Bank review of the consultants' iaterim report indicates ..hat the realign-
ment project would be justifie,; the draft f-;Aal report is due in March 1972.
The provision of final engineering at this stage is determined by the urgent
1/   Tecsult International (Canada) in association with Canadian National
Railways.



- ii -
need to overcome CFCO's capacity problem and the desirability of engaging the
same consultants to proceed immediately, upon completion of the feasibility
study. The IDA credit of US$6.3 million equivalent will finance the foreign
exchange cost of the final engineering (US$1.4 million), the acquisition of
'freight cars (US$4 million) and a traffic costing study (US$0.3 million),
!with US$0.6 million for contingencies.
v.        The freight cars will be acquired through international competitive
bidding. The final engineering of the proposed realignment will be carried
out by the consultants presently engaged in the feasibility study, and the
traffic costing study will be carried out by consultants to be chosen by ATC
with IDA agreement. ATC has firm commitments from its traditional sources of
finance in France and from the African Development Bank for the balance of
foreign exchange required to carry out the project.  The local cost is to be
provided by CFCO with internally gene'rated funds.
vi.       CFCO's financial position is satisfactory with an operating ratio
of 90% and a surplus of CFAF 225 million in 1970. The other two operating
sections of the ATC, and the ATC as a whole, also showed a surplus for 1970,
with similar satisfactory results expected in 1971.
vii.      The project is sound economically.  It is designed to enable the
railway to carry traffic which otherwise would not materialize because of
the absence of alternative modes. The financial return on the rolling stock
is about 18%. The project also provides the basis for the long-term develop-
ment of the railway closely related to the economic development of the Congo
and neighboring countries.
viii.     The project provides a suitable basis for an IDA credit to the
People's Republic of the Congo for relending to ATC for a term of 30 years,
including a five-year grace period, at an interest rate of 7-1/4%. A Proj-
ect Agreement has been negotiated and will be concluded between the Associ-
ation and ATC.



CONGO (BRAZZAVILLE)
APPRAISAL OF A RAILWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Congo-Ocean Railway (CFCO) is the central part of the Congo
transport system, owned and operated by the Agence Transcongolaise des Com-
miunications (ATC); the system also includes sea and river ports and a river
transport network which connects to the Central African Republic (CAR) and
Cameroon. The railway provides the basic link between the Atlantic Ocean and
the major Congo, Oubangui and Sanga river transport routes that open up the
northern part of the Congo, southern Cameroon, the CAR and Chad.
1.02      The capacity of the ATC system has become insufficient to meet traf-
fic requirements, with the CFCO railway representing the principal bottleneck.
Steps are being taken by ATC to improve the capacity of all parts of the
system. A major problem still remains on the CFCO, however, because of the
operating and physical limitations to traffic capacity on the railway through
a mountain range near the sea coast. A feasibility study for the improvement
of the railway in this 110-km long section between Holle and Dolisie has been
financed by the UNDP with the Bank as Executing Agency, and is being carried
out by the Canadian consultants, Tecsult, assisted by Canadian National Rail-
ways. A mid-term review of the study was held in Pointe Noire last May, at
which time the consultants' Interim Report was reviewed by the Bank, UNDP and
ATC. The Bank concluded, after complementing the consultants' findings with
its own technical and economic evaluation, that final engineering of the pro-
posed southern route should proceed once preliminary engineering is concluded
in early 1972. The realignment project's economic rate of return is suffi-
ciently high to warrant this early decision. Detailed engineering will give
a firm cost base to be used in the future overall assessment of the major con-
struction project. As any major improvement will take three to four years,
short-term measures to improve the capacity of the existing railway line for
this interim period are also needed.
1.03      ATC has prepared a five-year development program, 1971-1975, for
the CFCO in which the realignment through the mountains comprises about 50%
of the total program of US$81.3 million equivalent. ATC has begun discussions
with the Fonds Europeen de Developpement (FED), the Fonds D'Aide et de Cooper-
ation (FAC), the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) and the
Bank Group with a view toward arranging joint financing. These discussions
are to continue in 1972 after presentation of the Final Report on the align-
ment improvement feasibility study.
1.04      The Congo and ATC have asked the Bank group to assist in financing
a first project comprising a portion of the CFCO Investment Plan; it includes
mainly the provision of rolling stock, track works, maintenance equipment with
final engineering for the realignment of the route and a traffic costing study



for ATC, including CFCO. The project will enable the CFCO to satisfy the
growing traffic demand until the proposed realignment can be implemented.
The total cost of the first project is about US$25.1 million equivalent. An
IDA credit of US$6.3 million is proposed, to be made to the Government for
relending to ATC for a term of 30 years including a five-year grace period,
at an interest rate of 7-1/4%.
1.05      Bank Group lending for transportation in the Congo has so far con-
sisted of three highway credits totalling US$5.5 million. The first (S6-COB)
was for engineering and feasibility studies and was completed June 1971. The
second (189-OOB) was for the improvement of the Pointe Noire-Makola Road (34
km); contracts have been awarded and construction started in August 1971.
The third credit (274-COB) for a highway maintenance program was signed in
December 1971.
1.06      The appraisal of this railway project is based on information sup-
plied by the Government of the Congo and ATC, the consultants' Interim Re-
port 1/ and on the findings of a Bank mission, in May 1971, comprising Messrs.
J. Kesson (consultant railway engineer), F. Lawson (economist) and C.T. Vu
(financial analyst).
2. BACKGROUND
A. Economic Setting
2.01      The People's Republic of the Congo covers an area of 342,000 km ; it
borders on Gabon, Cameroon, and the CAR to the north, and on Zaire to the east
and south, with the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The country has a population
of 936,000, which is estimated to be increasing at about 2.2% a year. Popula-
tion and economic activities are not evenly distributed; over three-quarters
of the population lives in one-third of the country's area, mainly along the
railway corridor between Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. The country's north-
ern region is thinly populated and sparsely developed.
2.02      Land connections between and within countries in Equatorial Africa 2/
are still very limited. The Congo River is not navigable between Brazzaville
and the Atlantic Ocean and the railway between Pointe Noire and Brazzaville
is therefore a vital link that connects landlocked countries such as Chad and
the CAR to the rest of the world, through the seaport of Pointe Noire.
2.03      The most striking feature of the country's economy is its regional
transport role with a high proportion of transit traffic. As a result, the
1/   Feasibility Study of Improvements to the Congo-Ocean Railway (Tecsult/
Canadian National).
2/   Namely, Chad, Gabon, the CAR, Cameroon and the Congo.

service sector of the economy is relatively large. The principal transit
flows are manganese ore from Gabon; timber from Cameroon, the CAR and Gabon;
cotton from the CAR and southern Chad; and industrialized products, including
oil products, that flow into these countries via the Congo transport system.
These countries, with the exception of Chad, form the Central African Customs
and Economic Union (Union Douaniere et Economique de l'Afrique Centrale,
UDEAC). Alternative land transport routes may develop eventually in Gabon (a
railway from Owendo to Booue is likely to be constructed in the near future
which would provide the starting point for a link to the manganese mine at
Moanda) and in Cameroon (a railway or, more probably, a highway, from Yaounde
to Yokadouma; other highways north and east from Ngaoundere) but not for some
ears.  The Otraco railway in Zaire, from Kinshasa to the seaport of Matadi,
parallel to the CFCO, has its own operating and congestion problems, particu-
larly at Matadi. The analysis of future CFCO traffic, which takes into ac-
count these possible developments, indicates that CFCO's role as a transit
carrier is likely to continue and increase in the coming years, primarily in
view of increased timber flows from the CAR and Cameroon.
2.04      Traffic generated within the Congo, with the exception of timber, is
not estimated to develop very fast. Agriculture is mainly of a subsistence
nature and volumes of the few cash crops - sugar cane, and to a lesser degree
cocoa, coffee and groundnuts - are expected to remain relatively low for some
time to come. On the other hand forestry output, which currently accounts for
57% of the country's export earnings, is expected to expand considerably in a
few years, particularly in the north. Mining, which could become an import-
ant sector of the economy, has not developed as foreseen, mainly due to set-
backs in a Bank assisted potash project 1/. It has been recently reported
that important offshore oil deposits have been found near Pointe Noire. Iron
ore deposits near Zanaga seem shallow and of doubtful quality and cannot be
economically exploited at present. Industry, which developed quite briskly
in the past decade and which could in the future play a greater role in the
country's development and demand for transport, slowed down in the last two
years, partly due to the exhaustion of possibilities of import substitution.
2.05      The Congo's transport system is characterized by three particular
features: (a) the existence of ATC, described in the next paragraphs; (b) the
preponderance of transit traffic from Gabon, the CAR, Chad and southeast Cam-
eroon; and (c) the monopoly position of the CFCO carrying between 80-90% of
land transport traffic.
B.   The "Agence Transcongolaise des Communications" (ATC)
(i) Organization
2.06      ATC owns and operates an integrated system consisting of three sec-
tions: (a) the railway from Pointe Noire to Brazzaville (CFCO); (b) the ocean
1/   Compagnie de Potasse du Congo (CPC) (Bank Loan 480-COB, March 1967).



- 4 -
port of Pointe Noire; and (c) the port of Brazzaville and river transport
services on the Congo-Oubangui-Sanga rivers. Section (a) includes the main-
tenance by CFCO of a road between southern Gabon and Dolisie. The railway
forms the largest section, its revenues accounting for almost 70% of the
total for ATC, against 12% for the ocean port and 18% for the river services.
A privately owned railway, connected to the CFCO at Mont Bello, carries man-
ganese ore from a Bank-financed project in Gabon. 1/
2.07      ATC, formed in 1969, is the successor to a multinatioaal agency, the
Agence Transequatoriale des Communications (ATEC), created in 1958 by the
Congo, Gabon, the CAR and Chad to manage the 2,900-km transequatorial transport
route from Fort Lamy in Chad, through Bangui (CAR) to Pointe Noire. Now a
Congo national agency, ATC still performs many functions of the former ATEC by
virtue of agreements among the countries concerned.
2.08      ATC's controlling statute (Decree No. 70/38 dated February 11, 1970)
provides that it has financial autonomy and operates on a conui....cial basis.
It is administered by a Board with the Minister of Transport of the Congo as
President and 13 members consisting of other ministers and representatives of
the ruling party (Organization Diagram, Annex 1). The Board makes all deci-
sions except for (a) tariffs, budgets and investment programs, which must have
the approval of the Minister of Transport; and (b) loan conditions, which must
be approved by the CQuncil of State. The three operating sections have indi-
vidual budgets and investment plans and have to cover their expenses through
their own revenue. However, the statute provides for "financial solidarity"
of the three sections, specifying that surpluses in one section would be used
to cover deficits in another section. The arrangements appear reasonable in
view of the interdependence of the whole system, which showed a net surplus of
over CFAF 700 million in 1970 with a similar surplus expected in 1971, each
section being self-sufficient in both years. The five-year Investment Plan
1971-1975 for ATC (para. 4.01) has not been appraised in detail except for
the CFCO section, but the plans for each section and as a whole appear reason-
able.
2.09      ATC has a General Manager and an Assistant General Manager appointed
by the Council of State, on the recommendations of the Board; a financial con-
troller is nominated by the Minister of Finance. The General Manager has ade-
quate freedom to administer the normal business of ATC. Each section is in
the charge of a Manager who is responsible for the day-to-day business, while
the General Manager is responsible for overall budget administration, prepar-
ation of studies and programs and recommendations on tariffs. The General
Manager, his principal assistants, the managers of sections and the majority
of the staff are Congolese, while there are 135 experts at senior and super-
visory levels provided by French technical assistance. ATC intends to main-
tain the present level of such assistance.
1/ Compagnie Miniere de l'Ogooue (COMILOG), Bank Loan 230-FR, 1959; 49%
equity belongs to U.S. Steel and balance to French interests.



2.10      The management and development planning of ATC and its sections is
competent but relies considerably upon the French technical assistance and
will have to continue to do so for some years to come, until an increased
number of Congolese become available at the lower management and middle tech-
nical levels. Training programs exist but are not now sufficient, and it was
agreed at negotiations that ATC would establish or maintain programs adequate
to meet ATC's operations and would consult with the Association from time to
time on the programs and their execution.
(ii) Traffic
2.11      The ATC system must be considered on a regional basis.  In 1970,
.-ransit traffic was about 69% of the throughput of the Port of Pointe Noire,
60% of traffic on the CFCO and 74% of traffic through the Port of Brazzaville
and over the Congo-Oubangui-Sanga river system. These proportions are ex-
pected to grow considerably in the coming years.
2.12      The sea port of Pointe Noire had a total throughput of 2.9 million
tons in 1970 and the river port of Brazzaville handled 438,000 tons. Programs
to increase the capacities of both ports are under way. River transport on
the Congo-Oubangui-Sanga river system and its tributaries is assured jointly
by ATC and the Central African Government-owned shipping company, the Agence
Centrafricaine des Communications Fluviales (ACCF). A renewal and expansion
program for the river fleet has been prepared by ATC and ACCF but financing
has still to be completed. Adequate river transport capacity is essential
to timber transport and is critical toward achieving the timber traffic pro-
jected. ATC has applied to the Bank Group for assistance toward financing
part of the floating equipment required in the period to 1975. The applica-
tion is currently being reviewed by the Bank Group.
(iii) Budgets, Accounts and Audit
2.13      In the past, ATC has prepared only annual operating and capital bud-
gets for the CFCO. ATC has now prepared draft budgets for the CFCO for 1971-
1975 and will amend and extend them on an annual basis.
2.14      The accounting system of ATC is in general satisfactory but needs
modification to show clearly:
(a) the annual and accumulated depreciation amounts separately
from appropriations for improvements; and
(b) the annual financial charges, divided as to interest and
payment of principal, and related to the repayment schedule.
These modifications were agreed upon with ATC during negotiations.
2.15      The accounts of ATC are prepared by the Chief Accountant, under the
supervision of a Financial Controller appointed by the Ministry of Finance.
The Financial Controller is also required to supervise the audit of the



- 6 -
accounts, for which he reports to a Board of Auditors, consisting of a repre-
sentative of the Ministry of Finance, the Chief Justice of Pointe Noire and
the Public Service Paymaster in Pointe Noire. The Board is responsible for
the final verification. This arrangement does not provide an effective in-
dependent audit and, during negotiations, arrangements were agreed with the
Government and ATC for the appointment of independent auditors acceptable
to the Association. It was further agreed that the audited accounts will
be submitted to the Association no later than five months after the end of
every fiscal year.
C.   Other Transport Modes and Transport Planning
2.16      Road transport in the Congo has been of secondary importance so far.
Only 1,500 km (312 km paved) out of a total 8,300 km of classified roads pro-
vide reliable all weather surface. Motorization is very low with a total of
9,000 vehicles in 1969, or approximately 10 vehicles per thousand inhabitants
(compared with 20 per thousand in neighboring Gabon). The relative simplicity
of the country's economy, the preponderance of long haul bulk traffic and the
existence of a navigable river system preclude, at this time, the need for sub-
stantial trunk road development. There is no permanent road connection be-
tween Brazzaville and Pointe Noire on the coast or Brazzaville and Ouesso in
the north, although the Government has plans to establish permanent road con-
nections between these towns in the future. Construction of a paved road has
been started on certain sections between Brazzaville and Ouesso, and the sur-
vey of a road between Pointe Noire and Brazzaville is under way. The Asso-
ciation, however, considers that emphasis at this time should be put on im-
proved road maintenance standards, organization and training and possibly
feeder roads where warranted.  Confirmation was obtained from the Government
during negotiations that, before any major road construction between Pointe
Noire and Brazzaville is undertaken, a feasibility study would be carried
out and the Association be given opportunity to comment thereon. Railway
and river transport, complemented possibly by an improved air transport
system, could handle the projected traffic economically and efficiently.
2.17      The airport of Brazzaville provides regular international jet flight
service. A Government-owned national air transport company, Linacongo, pro-
vides internal air transport. Air transport could play a greater role in the
Congo, given the size of the country and the distribution of population
centers. UNDP technical assistance for civil aviation development is being
sought by the Government.
2.18      A detailed review of the transport sector can be found in the 1970
Bank Economic Report on the Congo, No. A-26, Volume II.
2.19      Uncil recently, there has been little central planning and coordi-
nation of transportation investments and policies in the Congo because the
major transport infrastructure belonged to the multinational agency, ATEC.
With the creation of ATC, all tra&isport modes now come under the jurisdiction
of the Congo Government, which will be of benefit to coordination, particu-
larly between rail and road, in the future. Given the limited size of the



- 7 -
country's transport system and the availability of qualified staff, a central
planning office, such as is now attached to the Presidency, should ensure
adequate coordination of investment and development policies.
3. CONGO-OCEAN RAILWAY
A.   General
3.01      The CFCO connects the sea port of Pointe Noire with the river port
of Brazzaville, over a distance of 510 km; it has a gauge of 1.067 m.  The
railway was constructed between 1921 and 1934 at minimum cost, with steep
gradients and sharp curvature over two mountain ranges, one, the Mayombe,
near the coast, between Pointe Noire and Dolisie, and the other, near
Brazzaville. The foreseen traffic capacity was probably some 500,000 net
tons per year.
3.02      In 1962, COMILOG started to produce manganese ore in southern Gabon
and to transport the ore by cable way (73 km long) to the Congo border and
then by its own railway (285 km long) to Mont Bello on the CFCO. The ore is
carried by COMILOG's own trains over the CFCO to Pointe Noire, while the CFCO
in turn provides a public service for passengers and freight on the COMILOG
railway; the arrangements, including the fees to be paid to each other, are
covered by agreements between the two governments and between ATC and COMILOG.
3.03      The COMILOG traffic built up to 1.5 million tons in 1970 while
timber log traffic also increased, reaching 646,000 tons in 1970 from 280,000
tons in 1960 and 10,000 tons in 1950. Other traffic, such as sugar, cement,
oils, wheat and general imports, increased as well, with the result that the
total traffic on the CFCO rose from about 700,000 net tons in 1960 to
3,150,000 net tons in 1970. This traffic, carried on heavier trains with
heavier axle loads, has brought about a number of problems, particularly over
the heavily used Mayombe mountain section, between Pointe Noire and Dolisie:
(a)  high rate of rail wear and thus short rail life on sharp
curves, where rails must now be changed every two years;
(b)  breakage of welded rail joints;
(c)  failure of superstructure of mass concrete arch viaducts;
(d)  difficulties of adequate track maintenance;
(e)  lack of room at stations for train movements; and
(f)  inadequate telecommunications to deal with train operations.
These factors, together with the general weakness of the track structure, lead
to considerable train delays and numerous accidents.



-8-
3.04      The project to mine potash by the Compagnie de Potasse du Congo
(CPC), at Km 45 from Pointe Noire, led the CFCO (between 1968 and 1970) to
realign and improve the track to Holle, at Km 57, to an adequate standard.
From Holle to Dolisie, however, the Bank and the then ATEC concluded in
1968, that, in view of the physical difficulties over the main mountain
section, more substantial improvement and realignment would be necessary.
As a result, the UNDP agreed to finance the feasibility study mentioned in
paragraph 1.02.
B.   Management and Staff
3.05      The CFCO is organized with the usual railway divisions of track and
works, mechanical equipment, operations and general staff administration. As
with ATC, the management of the CFCO is reasonably competent, but greater
emphasis needs to be placed on improving operational efficiency and on commer-
cial aspects (paras. 3.17 and 3.19).
3.06      The number of staff (Table 1) has increased at a slightly lower
rate than the increase in traffic. The output per employee is reasonable
and should improve further as bulk traffics of timber and manganese increase.
Salaries are relatively high for African railways and range from CFAF 202,000
to 3,600,000 (US$720 to 13,000) per annum, plus allowances at the lower levels.
Salaries are above the general level in Government and Commerce.
C.   Railway Property
Mi) Track
3.07      The original track material consisted of 30 kg/m rail carried on
light steel sleepers. Subsequently, between 1960 and 1966, with the start
of the COMILOG ore traffic, the track from Pointe Noire to Mont Bello (Km
200) was relaid with 36 kg/m rail on heavier steel sleepers. The increased
traffic and axle loading, however, has led to increasing problems in main-
taining the track. That between Pointe Noire and Holle (Km 57) has been
improved in alignment and gradient and again relaid with 43 kg/m rail; from
Holle to Dolisie (Km 167), a similar weight of rail should be laid once the
problems of grade and curvature have been overcome.
3.08      Beyond Dolisie to Brazzaville, track conditions are better and im-
provements can follow completion of the first priority work, Holle to Dolisie.
Preliminary proposals for Dolisie/Brazzaville are to be made by a technical
mission recently in the Congo from China (People's Republic of).
(ii) Locomotives and Cars
3.09      The CFCO's fleet of locomotives and railcars is all diesel and con-
sists of 33 main line, 30 shunting locomotives, and 7 passenger railcars
(Table 2). Some of the oldest main line and shunting units need replacement
by more powerful units, while one class of the newer units has not proved
entirely suitable for the arduous operating conditions. As a result, availa-
bility averages about 70Z;1, against a reasonable target of 85%.



- 9 -
3.10      There are 111 passenger and baggage cars, 39 passenger railcar
trailers and about 1,200 freight cars (Table 2). The majority of freight
cars are less than 30 years old, but a replacement program for the oldest
units, over 35 years old, badly damaged or corroded, is being started.
Availability of cars is reasonable.
3.11      Locomotives and cars on hand or on order (from France) should be
sufficient for traffic forecast to 1972/73. The rolling stock and motive
power are maintained to reasonable schedules but better spares provision,
especially of major components, and better workshop facilities are needed.
The main workshop at Pointe Noire, with secondary depots at Dolisie and
t-razzaville, is now inadequate for the increasing numbers of units. As
agreed during negotiations, ATC is to expand the facilities at Pointe Noire
for diesel locomotive maintenance, to meet the most essential need. At a
later date, freight car maintenance and the depots will be reorganized.
(iii) Other Property
3.12      Major strengthening of concrete viaducts and tunnel repairs between
Holle and Dolisie will be necessary if the existing alignment remains, but
are difficult to accomplish with present and increasing traffic. The proposed
realignment from Holle to Dolisie would make all these structures unnecessary
after 1975. Bridges and culverts elsewhere are adequate. Buildings at the
main centers are simple and satisfactory; at wayside stations improved facil-
ities will be introduced as new stations are built or existing ones recon-
structed.
3.13      Station signalling, train control and telecommunication equipment
are now inadequate; a complete reorganization with new equipment is needed.
Interim measures are proposed on the alignment Pointe Noire/Dolisie until
an improved alignment is available; at about this time, a new system should
be introduced between Pointe Noire and Dolisie or Mont Bello and extended
thereafter to Brazzaville as part of the upgrading of the remainder of the
line.
D.   Traffic and Operations
3.14      Traffic statistics for the years 1965-1970 and forecasts for 1971-
1975, with long range forecasts up to 1995, are given in Table 3. They
were arrived at after an evaluation of ATC's own forecasts, the consultants'
projections, the forecasts of the Bank's 1970 eco.mic mission to the Congo
and several other studies recently undertaken in tr.e Congo by consultants.
Freight traffic (in ton-km) has more than doubled in the 10 years 1960-1970.
Over the period 1971-1975, traffic is expected to increase by about 70% from
3.1 million to 5.3 million tons, mainly manganese ore up to t.ae limit of
capacity of the ropeway between the mine and railhead (2,230,000 tons), and
timber, both in logs and as sawn timber. On the longer term, the rate of
increase reduces, with timber traffic from the north increasing further but
that from the south declining. There are uncertainties in the long-term
forecasts because of the possible later development of alternative transport



- 10 -
routes mentioned in paragraph 2.03, and (a) the lack of precision in the
present forest policies and inventories in the Congo; (b) the production
levels of the traditional African timber producing areas, such as Ghana and
the Ivory Coast; and (c) the future world market for timber from Equatorial
Africa in view of growing competition from Southeast Asia. The future of
the potash traffic is also uncertain because of small reserves. A fuller
discussion on the traffic forecasts and particularly of the various aspects
of the timber industry, forest policy, ecology, extraction and marketing is
given in Annex 6.
3.15      Passenger traffic increased by about 12% in numbers and 32% in
pass-km during 1965-1970; this traffic is expected to continue to grow at
about 4% per annum. Passenger traffic may be affected eventually by the
construction of an all-weather road between Pointe Noire and Brazzaville
(para. 2.16).
3.16      Table 4 gives a smmiary of the CFCO's operating statistics 1965-
1970 and a comparison with 1960 and 1950. The utilization of equipment is
reasonable for a railway of this type. The most heavily used section is
that between Pointe Noire and Dolisie (Annex 2). With improved train
control, communications, signalling, vacuum braking system and crossing
loops, it should be possible to achieve increasingly longer heavier average
train loads, up to 1,500 gross tons by 1975, as compared with 560 tons in
1970 (Annex 3). This could bring the total freight traffic capacity, over
the full length of the railway, in 1975, to about 5.2 million net tons to
meet the demand forecast for that year. The figure, however, will be dif-
ficult to achieve and is considered by ATC/CFCO to be the limit possible,
and even then only for a limited period, until major improvement and realign-
ment of the critical Holle/Dolisie section will be available to provide in-
creased capacity.
3.17      An increasing number of long and heavy trains, such as envisaged,
can be carried on the existing line only with improved standards of opera-
tions. Therefore, more emphasis on the training of the operating staff will
be needed; this should be possible within the total French technical assist-
ance provided, and has been agreed upon with ATC during negotiations.
E.   Tariffs and Costs
3.18      Rates and fares must be approved by the Minister of Public Works
and Transport. Freight rates have been set largely on the basis of the
value of the commodities or by negoziated agreements for international and
special traffics. The rate per ton-km varies widely from CFAF 16 per ton-km
for the highest rated imports to CFAF 3.26 per ton-km for logs from Brazza-
ville; the average receipt for all traffic is CFAF 4.2 per ton-km, which
covers total cost. Passenger fares are relatively high, the average in 1970
being CFAF 3.5 per pass-km.



- 11 -.
3.19      Tariffs remained unchanged from 1958 to 1970, but during the first
half of 1971, the basic rates on timber from Brazzaville and from Southern
Gabon/Congo were increased, by 13.5 and 11% respectively, and on oil traffic
from Pointe Noire by 5%. A further tariff increase, averaging about 10%, is
considered necessary from July 1, 1972, and has been agreed by ATC during
negotiations (para. 6.11). The higher rated traffic, as well as passenger
and timber, will be subject to eventual competition as alternative means of
transport are developed in the Congo and in the other countries supplying
traffic to the CFCO. To enable ATC/CFCO to have available the basic data to
assess marginal and full costs of their principal commodities for future
tariff setting on their services, including negotiations with COMILOG and with
the Governments and users in adjacent territories, it is essential that a
traffic costing study be carried out. ATC agrees, and provision is made in
the proposed credit for funds for this purpose.
4. THE PLAN AND THE PROJECT
A.  The Plan
4.01      ATC has prepared a draft five-year Investment Plan 1971-1975 for
the CFCO (Table 5) and also for ATC as a whole (Table 6). The CFCO plan
forms 57% of the whole and totals CFAF 20.8 billion (equivalent to US$81.3
million).  About 50% of CFCO's planned capital expenditure will be for the
proposed realignment through the Mayombe mountains. Notes on the CFCO plan
are in Annex 4, while a siumary is shown on page 12.
4.02      ATC's physical investment plan appears reasonable.  ATC agreed
during negotiations that the Investment Plan would be reviewed periodically,
at least once a year, and also that, before making any major changes in-
volving more than the equivalent of US$1.0 million concerning the main
subcategories in the Plan, ATC would give the Association reasonable oppor-
tunity to comment.

B.   The Project
4.03      The project consists of the final engineering of the proposed major
realignment (but not its construction), a traffic costing study for the whole
of ATC and a portion of the 1971-1975 Investment Plan for the CFCO to enable
it to improve and expand its capacity. The project cost is estimated at CFAF
6.43 billion (US$25.1 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component
of US$20.9 million. A breakdown of the project and of the expenditure pro-
posed for financing under the proposed credit is shown on page 14.
4.04      Provision is made in the project for the annual requirements for
rail, sleeper and stone ballast replacements. Renovation of the weak parts
of concrete viaducts has also to be continued. It is necessary to lengthen
the sidings at stations between Brazzaville and Pointe Noire to cross longer,
heavier trains. To improve track maintenance, additional equipment is re-
quired, mainly gang cars, earth-moving units and smaller tools.
4.05      The principal need on the CFCO is to increase capacity through the
Mayombe mountain section between Holle and Dolisie. The best technical and
economic solution is indicated as being a major realignment of about 85 km.
Detailed engineering, required to finalize the cost estimates and to bring
the project to the stage of evaluation by ATC and the Association for a final
investment decision, is included in the project (see Annex 5 for Draft Terms
of Reference agreed with ATC), and should allow calling for bids in the second
half of 1973. Construction is estimated to take 2-1/2 to 3 years.
4.06      The main workshop at Pointe Noire and depots at Dolisie and Braz-
zaville lack adequate maintenance facilities. Provision is made for the ex-
pansion of diesel locomotive maintenance facilities at Pointe Noire, the most
essential need. Increases are also needed in the stocks of spares for loco-
motives and cars, especially of major items such as engines, motors and bogies.
The vacuum braking and drawgear on older freight cars are to be improved to
allow for greater utilization in longer, heavier trains.
4.07      New equipment, to keep step with the traffic growth forecast, in-
cludes one 3600-hp and seven 1800-hp main line locomotives, about 65 large
8-axle timber log cars, and about 140 general freight cars. Renewal is also
proposed for some of the older freight cars, over 35 years old, and now to be
scrapped; about 120 general freight cars will replace a greater number of
smaller capacity units.
4.08      The estimates in the project are based on 1971 international bid-
ding prices for the freight cars and on detailed figures for the engineering
and consultant services; 10% has been added to the freight car estimates as
contingency to allow for a possible rise of steel prices and general infla-
tion in the industrialized countries while 10% has also been added to the
consultancy service figures to allow for possible overruns. Cost estimates
have been converted into dollar equivalents at the current exchange rate of
CFAF 256 = US$1.0.

C.   Financing of the Project
4.09      The proposed IDA credit of US$6.3 million would finance the acquisi-
tion of freight cars (US$4 million), the foreign exchange cost of the realign-
ment final engineering (US$1.4 million), and the traffic costing study
(US$0.31 million) with US$0.6 million for contingencies.  General freight cars
are suitable for international competitive bidding, whereas, for reasons of
standardization, ATC prefers to obtain much of the CFCO's equipment, such as
locomotives, railcars, special eight-axle timber log cars and spares from pre-
vious suppliers in France. ATC has obtained loans from CCCE and grants from



- 15 -
FAC for part of the project, while it has agreement in principle, and is ne-
gotiating the details, for the greater part of the balance, with CCCE, FAC,
ADB and Congo local banks (Table 7). The remainder will come from ATC's own
resources. The following table shows the financing plan.

D.   Execution of the Project, Procurement and Disbursement
4.10      ATC and the CFCO are competent to carry out the project.  The
freight cars to be financed from the proposed credit would be acquired through
international competitive bidding. The final engineering of the proposed
realignment would be carried out by the same consultants, Tecsult (Canada),
engaged in the feasibility study financed by UNDP. The traffic costing study
would be carried out by consultants to be selected by ATC in agreement with
the Association.                     -
4.11      There is no domestic manufacture of freight cars.  Imports of freight
cars from member countries of the European Economic Community are exempt from
a 5% Import Duty payable by all other countries.  JThis would be accepted by the
Asociation for bid evaluation purposes.
4.12      Estimated disbursements of the proposed credit are given in Table 8.
Disbursements from the credit account will finance the foreign exchange cost
of freight cars and of the consultant services. If there are any savings on
the IDA financed items of the project, the total amount of the credit should
be reduced accordingly, because there are no similar items in the Plan beyond
the project period.

5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   General
5.01      The principal objective of the 1971-1975 Plan is to increase the
CFCO's capacity to cope with increasing traffic. Presently the constraining
factors are (a) insufficient motive power and rolling stock; (I) inadequate
communications; and, principally, (c) the inadequate alignment between Holle
and Dolisie.
5.02      Over 60% of the freight traffic is of transit nature, originating
or terminating in other countries of Equatorial Africa. This proportion
is likely to increase in the future as timber output in southeastern
Cameroon and CAR develops. Traffic as a whole is expected to increase on
average by 9.5% a year to 5.3 million tons in 1975 and thereafter taper off
to 3.2% a year through 1980. By 1985 total traffic should be of the order of
6.3 million net tons. Around 70% of the CFCO's traffic comprises timber and
COMILOG manganese ore. Further details on traffic are given in Table 3 and
Annex 6.
5.03      The economic evaluations that follow are based principally on the
CFCO's capacity constraint. Presently there are no alternative or competitive
routes or modes that could divert or economically transport traffic rejected
by the CFCO because of lack of capacity. Manganese ore originating in Gabon
is expected to be transported through the Congo for the next 10 years at least,
by which time the Owendo-Booue railway, with a spur to Moanda, may have been
constructed (Annex 6). Timber traffic from northern Congo, southeastern
Cameroon and the CAR is also captive to the ATC/CFCO system because there are
no alternative routes in those countries. If an all-weather road or railway
is built linking southeastern Cameroon/CAR with the Cameroon railway system,
it is possible that some timber traffic will be diverted from the ATC/CFCO
system. Nevertheless, as seen in more detail in Annex 6, it is unlikely that
this diversion would be substantial. Traffic diversion to the Kinshasa-Matadi
route is also unlikely because Matadi has its own long-term congestion problem.
Even if a paved road connection between Brazzaville and Pointe Noire is built,
it is not likely to divert the major part of the CFCO's freight traffic, which
consists mainly of bulk commodities.
B.   Economic Benefits
(i) Final Engineering of the Holle-Dolisie Realignment
5.04      The ongoing and proposed measures for the 1972/73 period will bring
the capacity of the critical export direction of the Holle/Dolisie section
up to around 4 million net tons per annum for a short period. However, be-
cause of the physical problems, the long-term export direction capacity of
the section is calculated as being between 3.3 and 3.7 million net tons, al-
lowing for improved operational efficiency, as described in Annexes 3 and 6.



- 17 -
5.05      Five alternatives for improving the capacity of the critical section
have been studied from the technical and economic aspects by the consultants
and the Association. These alternatives are detailed in Annex 6. The economic
evaluation demonstrated that the proposed realignment is the lowest cost solu-
tion. When discounted at 12% a year, the present value of total capital and
operating costs of the second best alternative is approximately 16.5% more ex-
pensive than the realignment solution.
5.06      When compared to a "do nothing situation", the proposal yields an
internal rate of return of 40.5%. The benefits that accrue are operating
savings for existing traffic and increased capacity to handle new traffic
by the rail route rather than by higher cost alternatives. Should nothing
be done to the existing line, as early as 1973, the CFCO would have to re-
ject 290,000 tons of freight due to insufficient capacity. It is estimated
that this foregone traffic would quickly increase to 760,000 in 1975, 1.4
million in 1980 and might reach 1.7 million tons in 1985 (Annex 6).
5.07      The economic evaluation is subject to some uncertainties which
should be studied more fully before a major construction project is under-
taken. The principal uncertainties are (a) traffic growth estimates of
timber; (b) the future of COMILOG manganese ore traffic after 1980 or 1985;
(c) construction cost estimates; (d) transport projects in the Cameroon
and the CAR that could divert traffic; and (e) the technical feasibility
and cost of transporting large volumes of timber on the Congo-Oubangui
river system.
5.08      Considering the above uncertainties, the sensitivity of the project's
internal rate of return was tested by assuming departures from the best esti-
mates. The results are given in Annex 6. The principal conclusion is that
the project is economically feasible, with an internal economic rate of return
of 13.8%, even under the following very pessimistic assumptions: (a) no capac-
ity constraint and consequently no benefits between 1971 and 1975, and (b) al-
lowance for a 20% capital cost overrun and a 25% benefit slip between 1976 and
1996. Alternatively, if (a) COMILOG traffic is diverted to another route in
1980, (b) capital costs are increased by 20% and (c) benefits are reduced by
10% through 1980, the internal rate of return is 12.4%. Final engineering to
firm up cost estimates is therefore highly justified and, during the final en-
gineering, the uncertainties should be studied further in order to reduce them
to the extent possible before final decision on the major project. This is
included in the final engineering terms of reference (Annex 5). The cost of
competing routes and long-term prospects of the timber traffic are to be
studied under the traffic costing and pricing study (paras. 4.03 and 5.12).
(ii) Rolling Stock
5.09      The project includes the addition to CFCO's fleet of 8 main line
locomotives and 205 freight cars to satisfy the traffic growth. The cost of
the investment is estimated at CFAF 2.2 billion (US$8.6 million equivalent).
This new equipment, being of higher capacity, would allow efficiency gains as
a result of larger and heavier trains. During 1970 and 1971, the CFCO was not
able to satisfy the traffic demand because of the shortage in power and cars.



- 18 -
With the new equipment the CFCO would obtain additional annual gross revenue
of about CFAF 1.5 million. The financial rate of return, estimated over a
25-year life period, is about 18%. The economic return would be higher,
since no alternative transport modes exist between Pointe Noire and Brazza-
ville.
5.10      The project also includes procurement of 120 freight cars, at a
total cost of CFAF 520 million (US$2.0 million equivalent), to replace 150
unserviceable cars which are over 35 years old. The financial benefits of
this replacement program, which amounts to CFAF 90 million per year, are
derived from reduced maintenance cost and savings in train operating cost.
The replacement is well justified with a financial rate of return of about
17%.
(iii) Track Works and Repairs of Structures and Equipment Maintenance
5.11      No separate evaluation was undertaken for interim track works and
structure repairs since this can be looked upon as an activity necessary for
the retention of a given line capacity. The same is applicable to spare
parts, improvements to cars and workshops (Annex 4).
(iv) Traffic Costing and Pricing Study
5.12      This study is required for two main reasons:  (a) to furnish ATC
with essential costing information by type of service and commodity so that
it can apply a flexible commercial policy in line with the economic require-
ments of the country and financial needs of ATC; and (b) to evaluate the
extent that ATC improvements will benefit other countries, such as Gabon,
the CAR and Cameroon, and formulate an adequate pricing policy in the light
of this evaluation (Draft Terms of Reference, agreed with ATC - Annex 7).
6.  EARNINGS AND FINANCES
A.   Past Earnings and Present Financial Position
6.01      A general assessment of the finances of ATC has been made, along
with a detailed appraisal of those of the CFCO, which is the direct benefi-
ciary of the proposed credit. ATC's summary balance sheet for 1970, its
first year of operation and the only year for which complete data are avail-
able, is reproduced in Table 9. It shows a generally satisfactory financial
position with a current ratio of 2.6 and a debt/equity ratio of 24/76. Total
ATC assets aggregate to about CFAF 20 billion; relative shares of its three
operating sections are 67% for CFCO, 27% for the Port of Pointe Noire, and
6% for the river navigation. ATC's income account for 1970 is reproduced
in Table 10. It shows a total revenue of CFAF 6.3 billion and an operating
ratio of 88%, which is considered reasonable. Of the above total, about
CFAF 6 billion derives from traffic and general operations of the three
sections, 70% for CFCO, 12% for Port of Pointe Noire and 18% for river
navigations.



- 19 -
6.02      The detailed appraisal of the CFCO's finances has been based on
CFCO income accounts for 1960 (the first full year in which ATEC operated)
and for 1965-1970, reproduced in Table 11. There was a net loss in 1960,
but by 1965 this had turned into a reasonable net income with an operating
ratio of 82% and a return on average net fixed assets in use of 6.9%. The
improvement was due mainly to the introduction of the COMILOG manganese ore
traffic and the beginning of the increase in timber log traffic. The net
income was maintained at about the same level from 1966 to 1969 with a re-
turn on average net fixed assets varying between 8% and 9%. Increased
maintenance and depreciation charges, however, led to a deterioration of
the operating ratio to 90% and a rate of return of 5% in 1970, the first
full year of operation within the new ATC setup.
6.03      "Straight-line" depreciation, charged on the basis of asset lives
and their historical cost, is at present about 15% of revenue, which is
reasonable. The 1971-1975 Investment Plan will increase the book value of
assets by about 130%, and revaluation of the older assets will be desirable.
As a first step, the terms of reference for the costing study will require
tevaluation of principal classes of assets.
6.04      The CFCO labor costs have been kept at a reasonable level of about
57% of total Trking costs.  Following a strike at the end of 1970, salaries
at the lower levels were increased and many former temporary workers were
transferred to permanent status, leading to a rise in 1971 to 59% of projected
total working costs. As a consequence, the income statement (Table 11) shows
a drop in total net revenue estimated for 1971.
6.05      Financial charges were moderate up to 1967 but have since increased
due to the purchase of new equipment and material, financed by French and
local credits, to accommodate the increasing traffic. The details of exist-
ing loans are given in Table 12.
6.06      The balance sheets for 1960 and 1965-1970 are given in Table 13.
CFCO's financial position is sound, with a current ratio fluctuating be-
tween 2.5 and 6 and a debt/equity ratio of about 17/83. Receivables have
risen in recent years, mainly due to the failure of the Government and Gov-
ernment agencies to settle their accounts with the CFCO. The accumulated
total of Government debt at the end of 1971 was about CFAF 250 million
(US$980,000 equivalent). During negotiations, the Government agreed that all
future debts will be settled by the end of each fiscal year during which they
are incurred and that the Government will use its best efforts to settle its
present outstanding debt to ATC as soon as possible.
B.   The Financing Plan
6.07      The financing scheme of the CFCO for the period 1972-1973, includ-
ing the project, is summarized on the next page.

6.08      Approximately 15% of the financing of the project will be met
by CFCO's own funds. Grants and credits from traditional lending sources
will make up the remaining 85%, of which 45% has been agreed and 40% is
being negotiated.
6.09      The financing of the first-year portion of the major realignment
construction, estimated to start in 1973, is assumed for the present to be
met by grants (55%), loans (35%) and CFCO's own funds for the remaining
portion (10%).
6.10      The financing of road maintenance equipment (para. 2.06) will be
entirely met by CFCO's own funds, as well as the increase allowed for CFCO's
working capital. CFCO's aggregate share in the whole financing scheme for
the period 1972-1973, including the project, will amount to about 16%, an
acceptable although somewhat low contribution. Assumptions on which this
contribution is based are discussed in paragraph 6.11.
C.   Future Prospects
(i) ATC
6.11      A general appraisal of ATC's future finances has been established
on the basis of traffic forecasts prepared by ATC representatives and reviewed
by the Association. Revenue projections for ATC based on the above forecast
data, and on existing tariff levels, indicate that ATC may not be able to gen-
erate enough cash to contribute its expected share of CFAF 4.0 billion to the
Investment Plan 1971-1975 (including the proposed major realignment construction).



- 21 -
Therefore, an increase in the revenue earning capacity of ATC will be neces-
sary and it has been agreed that ATC will increase its tariffs by an average
of 10% starting July 1, 1972. Revenue projections made on this new basis of
increased tariffs are produced in Table 10. Operating ratios between 1972
and 1975 show an average of 86%, which is reasonable. Times interest earned
ratios throughout the same period decline from 4.9 to 2.5, a level deemed
sufficient with a corresponding debt-service coverage ratio of 1.9. During
negotiations, the ATC agreed to readjust its tariffs from time to time to
cope with any effect of inflation and to continue its operations on a satis-
factory commercial basis. In order to maintain the future creditworthiness
of ATC, it has been agreed that no future debt will be contracted by ATC with-
:o; prior agreement with the Association, unless net cash revenue from opera-
,ions at the time of incurring the debt amounts to at least 1.25 times ATC's
maximum future debt-service requirements.  ATC cash flow projections for the
Investment Plan period 1971-1975 are produced in Table 14 and reflect an ade-
quate cash position.
(ii) CFCO
6.12      A detailed appraisal of the CFCO's financial prospects up to 1975
has been carried out. Income estimates for 1971, for which complete data
from CFCO are still pending, and forecasts for 1972-1975 are shown in Table
11. These are made in the light of the traffic and revenue forecasts in
Tables 3 and 15 respectively. There was a rate increase of 11 to 13.5% on
timber traffic and 5% on oil products in 1971 to enable the CFCO to meet ris-
ing costs, mainly from increases in salary levels. In view of the forthcoming
execution of the project and of the major realignment construction, the CFCO
will be faced with increased cash requirements. It was therefore agreed dur-
ing negotiations that the CFCO will increase its overall tariffs by a margin
of 10%, effective July 1, 1972, as part of the general increase of ATC's
tariffs (para. 6.11).
6.13      Projections for operating expenses have been made on the basis of an
adjusted cost level estimated for 1972. Operating expenses for the later years
are determined in direct relation to traffic volume. On the basis of forecasts
made up to 1975, both revenues and operating expenses show a reasonable growth
pattern in line with the past trends. Working ratios would remain for 1972
through 1975 at the 75% level, with operating ratio at 88%. This performance
is satisfactory. Furthermore, it was agreed during negotiations that a rate
of return on average net fixed assets in use, on the present basis of assets
valuation, of at least 6% should be earned by the CFCO in 1973 and no less than
5% over the subsequent years. Such rates of ret4rn will be reviewed with the
Association immediately after the completion of the proposed costing study and
will be periodically modified thereafter as required in order to ensure that
the CFCO will be able to meet all expenses, taxes, charges and investment costs
accountable to its services.
6.14      An estimated balance sheet for CFCO for 1971 and forecasts for
1972-1975 are shown in Table 13. The data reflect a satisfactory liquidity
position with liquid and current ratios being equal to 1 and 2 respectively.
The debt/equity ratio will rise to a maximum of 41/59 in 1973 upon completion



- 22 -
of the financing of the project but it will decline gradually thereafter be-
cause maturing debts are being paid and the financing of the realignment con-
struction is assumed to be met for the most part with grants (60%) and in-
ternally generated funds (10%). This maximum debt/equity ratio is considered
acceptable.
6.15      The CFCO's cash flow forecasts covering the span of the Investment
Plan period (1971-1975) are shown in Table 16. With the inclusion of the
capital expenditures on the major realignment construction, the forecasts
indicate a tight cash position which may turn into a shortage should any
marginal increase in operating costs occur. It therefore seems that the
ability of the CFCO to contribute its expected share to the Investment Plan
will require further detailed study when the costs of the major realignment
are known more precisely. Unless these costs are lower than now projected,
additional funds will be required, either from new borrowing or from another
tariff readjustment. Hitherto, major sources of funds contributing to the
requirements of ATC and, in particular, the CFCO, for capital investment
spendings, have been FED, FAC, and CCCE. These sources are expected to con-
tinue helping ATC and the CFCO meet their future needs. The neighboring
countries and COMILOG, which will ultimately benefit from the improvement
resulting from the realignment work, should also be encouraged to take part
in some of the financing of the Investment Plan or at least to guarantee a
level of traffic through the Congo in order to help the CFCO pay off its
capital expenditure commitments.
7.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government of
the Congo and ATC on the following principal items:
(a)  feasibility study to be carried out before any major road
construction between Pointe Noire and Brazzaville is under-
taken (para. 2.16);
(b)  Revision of tariffs before July 1, 1972 to enable ATC to
meet its cash requirements for its investment plans in
1972 and 1973 (para. 3.19);
(c)  financial targets for fiscal year 1973; and for subsequent
years, subject to review following the completion of the
proposed traffic costing study (para. 6.13);
(d)  debt limitation arrangements for ATC (para. 6.11).
7.02      The project provides a suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$6.3
million equivalent. The proposed credit would be made to the Government of
the People's Republic of the Congo to be relent to ATC with a term of 30
years, including a five-year grace period, at an interest rate of 7-1/4%.
A Project Agreement has been negotiated and will be concluded between the
Association and ATC.

ANNEX 3
Page 1
CONGO-OCEAN RAILWAY
Existing Line Capacity
1.        Tecsult report gives total capacity of CFCO, on existing align-
ment, with some improvements, but without Centralized Traffic Control (CTC)
as:
(a)  With 675m long crossing loops                 = 4.8 mill. tons
(b)  With 1,000m long crossing loops               = 7.2 mill, tons
2.        ATC and Bank consider capacity, with loop lengths varying
650-1,OOOm according to physical possibilities, to be = 5.2 mill. tons
including potash
or
= 4.8 mill. tons
excluding potash
3.        Tecsult report gives capacity with CTC as:
(a)  With 675m long crossing loops                 = 8.4 mill. tons
(b)  With 1,OOOm long crossing loops               =12.2 mill. tons
4.        All Tecsult forecasts are on the basis that load per car will be in-
creased from 22.6 tons to 33.9 tons or by 50%. No definition is given of
a "car"; also the predominant traffic of timber logs is already being
loaded to the structure gauge limit. From a check made by ATC, on the
basis of the standard 14m long car, and allowing for the greater loading
per meter of trains with 21m longlog cars (now being introduced), the
average car load in 1975 could rise to 26 tons, i.e., an increase of 18%.
5.        If, then, allowance is made for an increase in car load of 18%
only, instead of 50%, the Tecsult figures, with CTC, would become:
(a)  With 675m crossing loops                      = 6.6 mill. tons
(b)  With 1,OOOm crossing loops                    = 9.5 mill. tons
These involve operating 7 trains per day all to maximum load. As noted
in 7.2 and 7.3 following, feasible train paths for CFCO through trains
is 6 maximum, on, say, 300 days per year; not all trains can be assumed
to be of maximum load and the capacity should be reduced another 20%, say,
to make allowance.
6.        Thus, with 6 trains per day at 1,700 net tons less 20%, on 300
days/year:

Annual down traffic capacity, with CTC                = 2.6 mill. net tons
add up traffic, say                                   = 1.0 mill. net tons
- COMILOG                                               - 2.2 mill. net tons
Potash                                                = 0.4 mill. net tons
6.2
say     6.5 mill. net tons
Cost CTC installation, from Tecsult, excluding crossing loop extensions but
including cost timber sleepers, Pointe Noire/Holle and Dolisie/Mont Bello:
Signal installations       = CFAF 750 mill.           = US$3.1 mill.
Timber sleepers            = CFAF 700 mill.           = US$2.5 mill.
Total                      = CFAF 1550 mill.          - US$5.6 mill.
7.   Calculation down traffic capacity, Dolisie/Pointe Noire in 1975
7.1 To allow time for working daily on track on critical section in
daylight hours, maximum possible train service in each direction from CFCO
train chart is:
Passenger autorail                                    =  2
COMILOG manganese trains                              =  3
CFCO freight trains                                   =  7
TY
Potash:Holle/Pointe Noire                             =  1 (up to 3)
TY
7.2       Of the seven paths for CFCO freight trains, one is needed for a daily
station-to-station work train.
7.3       In addition, time must be allowed for (a) service trains re-
quired for track works, (b) reduced service on Sundays for track works
and viaduct repairs, (c) general track maintenance, (d) accidents and de-
railments, (e) major rail renewals on sharp curves, and (f) cumulative de-
lays arising from the previous items. All this (and CFCO statistics)
indicate that the number of full working days available per year should
not be taken at more than 300.
7.4       Traffic to be carried towards Pointe Noire from Dolisie (down)

7.14      Thus, station crossing loop lengths 650 to 700m minimum length
could be adequate for Pointe Noire/Dolisie until the end of 1975, although
1,OOOm where feasible, will be preferable (Tecsult Interim Report proposes
alternatives of 675m or 1,0OOm). Up trains of predominately empty timber
cars could be longer than 650m, but may need to be restricted until larger
(1,OOOm) loops are available eventually.
7.15      The introduction of 21m long timber log cars will mean that,by
1975, there will b_ about 215 of these cars in use and about 440 of the
original 14 m long cars, The new cars give an average load per car (mixed
"imbers Limba and Okoume) of 57 tons, compared with 30 tons on the original
cars (as improved to carry increased volume). The load per meter length of
train with new cars becomes 2.6 tons as against 2.0 with the old. Thus,
the new cars will bring about an increasing reduction in the average length
of trains for the same load.
7.16      Only a few station crossing loops Pointe Noire/Dolisie/Mont Bello
(for the COMILOG traffic) now require lengthening to give the minimum of
650-700m lengths. A number, where feasible, are being lengthened to 1,OOOm.
7.17      On the Mont Bello/Brazzaville section, all station crossing loops
(about 19) need lengthening; initially, however, because of the lower number
of long trains (3 or 4 each way), and better operating conditions on the
section, about 8 or 9 selected stations should be dealt with (to give
1,000m), to enable through trains to operate Brazzaville/Pointe Noire.
OA_
7.18      The critical direction controlling capacity is the "down" or
export direction to Pointe Noire. As noted in paragraph 7.4, the projected
CFCO traffic for 1975 in this direction is 1.9 million tons; if anticipated
COMILOG traffic at 2.2 million tons is added, the total to be carried, with-
in the capacity available, will be about 4.1 million tons. This will involve
the aege gross train load going up to about 1500 tons (para. 7.5) from the
present 560 tons, or almost thtse-fold. Traffic at this level with the ex-
isting physical and equipment constraints will be possible only with excep-
tional operating effort and over a limited period. If the existing con-
strainingconditions were to remain indefinitely (that is, no major alignment),
then the basic long-term average annual capacity in the down direction would
be less, say 20%, or 3.3 million tons, to allow for either the gradually de-
teriorating physical state of the track and infrastructure or, alternatively,
c;e time required for the continuous works required to keep them in reason-
abie condition.

1971-1975 Investment Plan - Main Iters
Track (14% of total expenditure)
Due to the physical and climatic conditions in the Mayombe
mountain area and to the weight of traffic, the rail on sharp curves wears
rapidly and is now having to be replaced about every two years in the
wC.,st locations. Provision is made for the annual needs of rail, also of
_ceel sleepers and stone ballast renewals, to the end of 1975, which is
the earliest that a new alignment through the Mayorbe mountains, if ap-
proved, will be available. It is also necessary to continue repairs to
the weak portions of the many concrete viaducts and to the summit tunnel
lining, in the mountain section, showing signs of failure.
To enable longer and heavier trains to be operated as through
trains between Brazzaville and Pointe Noire, it is necessary to lengthen
the crossing loops at stations to the maximum extent possible in the
mountain section, and at selected sites over the rest of the line.
To improve track maintenance, additional equipment is needed,
mainly the provision of gang cars for the transport of men and materials,
earth-moving units, ballast tampers and smaller tools.
Holle-Dolisie Realignment (49% of total expenditure)
To overcome the operating problems and to carry the traffic fore-
cast for the future, a realignment of the railway through the Mayombe
mountain section is proposed. A possible route has been found, but it in-
volves considerable tunnelling and heavy earth works; in completing the
preliminary feasibility study, the consultants will endeavor to reduce the
lengths of tunnel and other works required. The final engineering will be
completed thereafter, to arrive at more detailed data and a close estimate
of cost up to the stage of calling for bids. A decision about eventual
construction and also about the signalling and communication system to be
provided must wait for the outcome of the final engineering but, for the
meantime, approximate preliminary estimates of costs are included in the
Investment Plan.
Equipment Maintenance (5% of total expenditure)
The main workshops at Pointe Noire and the depots at Dolisie
and Brazzaville are inadequate in size and facilities for the numbers of
locomotives and cars now in the fleet and to be added during coming years
as the traffic increases furzier.  A mission from Ma-^'nland Cnina has made
a preliminarv study ar.d is due to report shortly.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
In order to decrease the time spent in workshops by locomotives
and thus improve their availability, it is essential to improve the stock
of spare parts and especially of major items such as diesel engines, power
bogies, electric motors, alternators, and compressors.
For the operation of longer,heavier trains it is necessary to
improve the vacuum braking system on existing freight cars. A study has
been made by a technical expert fron SOFRERAIL (of France); he has made
recommendations which involve the fitting of modernized equipment on
freight cars having a reasonable future life. It is also essential to
replace the bogies of old and unsatisfactory types on a proportion of the
freight cars, by modern bogies with roller bearings, so as to enable maxi-
mum utilization of the stock to be obtained.
New Equipment (21% of total expenditure)
Provision is made for the purchase of additional main line and
shunting locomotives and also for the replacement of some of the older low
powered locomotives, during the plan period, in step with the forecast
growth in traffic. Similar provision is made for freight cars, mainly to
carry timber logs but also for general freight. Some existing cars, over
35 years old, have now reached the end of their useful life, being in poor
condition and too costly to maintain; these are to be replaced by a smaller
number of larger capacity cars (Annex 3). Two additional passenger rail-
car power units plus ten trailer cars are also included to cover the
projected increase in passenger traffic during the period.
Miscellaneous and Contingencies
Account for the remaining 11% of expenditure.

*Actual

2.        The share of timber over total traffic will increase from approxi-
mately 21% in 1970 to 36% by 1980.
3.        Between 1970 and 1975 the average anrnual growth of timber is proj-
ected to be approximately 19.3% (compared to 9.2% a year during the period
1965-1970). After 1975 growth should decline to 7.2% through 1980 and 1.3%
thereafter to 1995. These incremental timber flows will be generated main-
ly in new forestry areas where concessions have been recently granted; to a
large extent these concessions are located in Southeast Cameroon and South-
east Central African Republic.  Concessions in the Itorthern Congo are still
few. Development of this new forestry area is pending a well defined for-
estry policy from the part of the Congolese Government. Production from
Southern Congo and Southern Gabon is expccted to increase slightly in the
coming years but slowly decline after 19S0 as first-cut forestry reserves
are depleted. The following table shows the origin of timber traffic to be
transported by CFCO in thousands of net tons.

by rail (CFCO) to Pointe Noire.
2/   By river from north to Brazzaville and thereafter by rail (CFCO) to
Pointe Noire.
4.        The above timber traffic forecasts were arrived at by the Bank Group
after (a) evaluating and discussing with ATC their own forecasts (higher),
which ATC arrived at after missions to the prospective production areas and
two meetings held in Pointe Noire in 1970 with Government officials and logging
companies of the Congo, Cameroon, CAR and Gabon;  (b) evaluating and dis-
cussing the consultants (Tecsult) projections; (c) analyzting other recent
projections such as one prepared by an FAO expert who visited the forestry
region in February 1971 and also the projections contained in the report
"Transport des Bois par Voie Fluviale" prepared by the consultants SEDES.
5.        The projected timber production seems feasible.  In the last two
years around 2 million hectares of permits have been granted in Southeastern
Cameroon (Ngoko-Sangha region) to 17 different enterprises. Production is
expected to develop slowly in the next two to three years but pick up around
1975, as concessionaries get physically installed in the field, and after
they are assured that they will not encounter transportation bottlenecks -
river navigation, port of Brazzaville, CFCO railway and port of Pointe Noire
(para. 2.12). Over 1 million hectares of permits have also been awarded in
the Central African Republic bordering the rivers Sangha and Lobaye-Oubangui.
Production from the Northern CongDis less predictable at this stage.
Knowledge of the region is still scarce, although this should be remedied after
an FAC financed forestry inventory currently under way is concluded this year.
Nevertheless, preliminary estimates put reserves at around 45 million m3. To
date only three permits have been granted in the area. Before the above in-
ventory is completed and further knowledge is available about the other re-
gions it is not possible to assess the possible effects of the proposed levels



ANNEX 6
Page 3
of forestry activity on the ecology. However, a recent study 1/ for the
Bank in Gabon where similar conditions prevail, on the effects of forest
extraction on the environment there, indicates that "current practices re-
sult in no appreciable harm to the forest as a biological entity".
6.        Traditionally, Africa has supplied around 90% of Western Europe's
tropical wood demand, which has been increasing 5.5% a year (around 7.5
million m3 of logs in 1969). The main suppliers are Ghana, Nigeria, Ivory
Coast and Gabon and more recently Cameroon and the Congo and Zaire.  Production
in some of these countries has been decreasing or stabilizing as reserves
are being depleted. For instance, Ghana exports decreased from around 1
million m3 in 1960 to 700,000 m3 in 1969, and Nigeria from 800,000 to
350,000 m3 in the same period. Exports from the Ivory Coast have increased
considerably (850,000 mJ in 1960 to 3.5 million in 1969) in the past, but
are expected to level off in the future. There seem to be good possibili-
ties for expansion of production in non-traditional areas so as to meet an
estimated European demand of between 12 and 15 million m3 of tropical hard-
wood by 1975. Competition from Southeast Asia on the European market is not
expected to be significant because of the high transportation costs involved.
COMILOG Traffic Prospects
7.        The traffic projection arrived at by the mission for COMILOG manga-
nese traffic on the CFCO railway is conservative. It is estimated that traf-
fic will grow from its 1970 level of 1.5 million tons to 2.2 million tons by
1975 and thereafter remain at the same level during the lifetime of the
project. The increase through 1975 is related to the company's current
investment program to increase transport capacity. By 1972 the number of
wagons should have been increased from the current 300 to 500 and loco-
motives from 14 to 22. Further increases thereafter are limited to the
cableway's capacity (between Moanda and M'Binda) estimated at 2.2 million
tons a year. Assuming unchanged output during 1976-1996 is a cautious as-
sessment. If COMILOG is to maintain its current 20% share of the world
market for manganese, production should grow at around 6% to 7% a year.
Under this growth assumption, production would increase to around 4 million
tons by 1985. Manganese reserves are very large, 180 million tons of proven
reserves, only in the explored area of a much larger deposit which covers
the whole plateau around Moanda. To overcome the cableway capacity constraint,
three alternatives are foreseen:
(a) construct a second cableway, parallel to the present one;
(b)  extend the railway from M'Binda to the mine at Moanda (76 km);
(c)  build a railway branch line which would join up with the
proposed Owendo-Belinga raiiway at Booue (approximately 340 km).

of the Environment and Perpetuation of the Farestry Potential - Paul
Bedard and Steghen B. Preston.

8.        None of the alternatives have been fully studied.  Preliminary
estimates show that direct transport costs on the Moanda-Owendo alter-native
would be less than half of the existing Moanda-Pointe Noire transport costs.
On the other hand there are large sunk investments under the existing ar-
rangement (railway from M'Binda to Mont Bello. cableway and port loading
facilities at Pointe Noire). If incremental costs are taken into account
in evaluating the construction of a new branch line (Moanda-Booue) vis-
a-vis maintaining the existing system through the Congo, it is very unlikely
that an all Gabonese traffic route for COMILOG would be an economically vi-
able proposition. Economic considerations indicate that emphasis should be
directed to finding a solution within the existing Gabon-Congo system.
The feasibility and comparative advantages of doubling the cableway against
extending the railway between Moanda and M'Binda should be evaluated. Until
this problem is settled it was decided to maintain a constant traffic volume.
The impact of an eventual diversion of COMILOG traffic, however, was
assessed in the mission's evaluation, through a sensitivity analysis.
CPC Potash Traffic Prospects
9.        Potash traffic is relevant to the project (construction of Southern
route) only as far as CFCO's overall financial condition is concerned. Traf-
fic originates near Holle and proceeds thereafter westwards towards a maritime
terminal at Point Noire. It is estimated that traffic will reach 360,000 to
400,000 net tons in 1971 but a recent Bank Industrial Projects mission has
indicated that this output level could be sustained for only five years from
the proven reserves. The long-term availability of potash is being further
evaluated but in view of the uncertainties no allowances for potash traffic
have been made beyond 1975.
Economic Evaluation of the Final Engineering of the
Southern Route
10.       Five technical alternatives regarding a solution for CFCO's capac-
ity constraint in the 110 km section between Holle and Dolisie were examined,
of which three were fully evaluated.
(a) Alternative 1 - Realignment of the section Holle/Fourastie;
and a complete new southern route, 85 km
long, between Fourastie and Moukondo near
Dolisie;
(b) Alternative 2 - A complete new northern route between Holle
and Dolisie;
(c) Alternative 3 - Partial realignment, to the maximum extent
possible, of the existing route between Holle
and Dolisie;



ANNEX 6
Page 5
(d) Alternative 4 - Track and communications improvements to the
existing line; and
(e) Alternative 5 - A combination and implementation in stages of
alternatives 4 and 1.
11.       The evaluation of alternative 2 was cursory only, for, at an early
stage, it was established that capital and operating costs would be higher
than for alternative 1 (southern route). Alternative 3 was also not fully
evaluated since technically the southern route is a superior solution and
furthermore would not cause a considerable amount of traffic disruption
during construction. Alternative 4 foresees the relaying of track with
heavier 50 kg/m rail, new sleepers, improved platform and ballast and in-
stallation of a centralized traffic control system but maintaining the
same alignment characteristics. Whereas operational savings would accrue
with these improvements, the export direction capacity would still ultimately
be limited to around 5.1 million net tons on the section. Furthermore, heavy
track maintenance would continue after these improvements, and practically
all structures would sooner or later have to undergo major reconstruction,
which again would cause severe traffic disruption. Alternative 5 envisages
undertaking the above partial improvements which would increase capacity to
meet demand up to 1983/84; construction of the southern route, alternative
1, would be postponed and would start only in 1981 and be completed in time
to meet saturation in 1983/84. Finally, alternative 1 proposes the construc-
tion of a completely new southern route between Fourastie and Moukondo in
the immediate future.
12.       The Bank Group has had to rely heavily on its own judgment in
evaluating these alternatives. The Consultants' economic evaluation as
expounded in their Interim Report is incomplete and at times incorrect.
The Consultants have been advised of these deficiencies and agreement has
been reached that they will revise and supplement their findings according
to the discussions held with the Bank Group. The revision is to be incor-
porated in the Draft Final Report on the Congo-Ocean railway to be submitted
in March 1972.
13.       To arrive at the best solution among alternatives 1, 4 and 5,
total costs, i.e., capital costs plus operating costs plus the economic cost
of foregone traffic (due to lack of capacity, for example, during track im-
provements to the existing line) were calculated for the project life - 25
years, and discounted at 12% a year. The present value of total costs arrived
at were, respectively:

Alternative 1                             18,125

14.       Once established that Alternative 1 is the lowest cost solution
and consequently elected as the project solution, it was compared to a "do
nothing" alternative so as to ascertain the proJect's net benefits and eco-
nomic return.
15.       Under the "do nothing" alternative, allowing only for recurrent
maintenance expenditures, it is estimated that the export direction capacity
at the Holle/Dolisie section would currently be around 3.3 million net tons
a year. Admitting an efficiency gain of 0.5% a year, due to improved opera-
tions over 25 years, an increase of 0.4 million tons was arrived at. Traffic
foregone by the railway under the "do nothing" alternative would be:

16.       The economic loss attached to this foregone traffic is very con-
siderable, not only to the economy of the Congo but also to Cameroon and
the Central African Republic, where a large portion of the projected traffic,
mainly timber, is expected to originate.
17.       It is assumed that all foregone traffic will be made up by timber.
It is further estimated that, should there be a capacity constraint of the
CFCO, timber traffic originating in Southeast Cameroon, Southwest CAR and
the Northern Congo will look for an alternative route to the sea. The most
likely alternative route would be a rail or road connection between Moloundou
in Southeast Cameroon to the Regifercam railway at Yaounde. Leaving aside
the merits or demerits of the construction of such a new route and assuming
for the purpose of this analysis that such a route would exist by 1976, the
operating costs on each route were evaluated and compared. It is further
assumed that the road between Moloundou and Yaounde will be a paved one. I/
1/   All costs are net of taxes.  Road costs are average vehicle operating
costs for a 20-ton semi-trailer assuming a 50% load factor, plus var-
iable road maintenance costs. Rail costs are variable operating costs,
including track maintenance and depreciation of rolling stock. Barges
and rafts are variable operating costs including depreciation.

Savings of Congo Route - CFAF 1,390.00/ton or CFAF 3.96/ton-km
18.       It was further assumed that 25% of the projected timber traffic
increase would not be generated in the case of the more costly alternative
via the Cameroon (29% higher transportation cost). This higher transportation
cost would increase the present average FOB price of logs (estimated at CFAF
9.000 m3) by more than 15%. Admitting that the value added through timber
production, retained by the economy, is approximately 55% of the FOB price
of timber, the value added foregone to the regional economv (Cameroon, CAR
and the Congo) would be CFAF 4.95O per m3 of logs.
19.       Based on the above figures regarding CFCO's capacity constraint
and the cost differential of transporting the projected traffic on an al-
ternative route, together with the operating savings accruirig to the pro-
posed new Southern Railway Route, the total savings of Altzrnative 1 were
arrived at. Tnese savings whern compared to the capital costs involved in
constructing the Soutnern Route yielded an econormic rate of return of 40.5%
(refer to Table at end of Annex 6).

C?.       Several or the variables and pir.m=eters incorporated in the analysis
are subject to a varying degree of n-rcertainty, namely:
(a)  The growth of timber output and conseouently traffic, specific-
ally in the forthcoming 4 to 5 years. Although best estimates
have been used, established after consultations with ATC, private
logging companies, and the consultants and evaluation of several
studies recently completed, there is still margin for uncertainty
because of the lack of reliable forestry inventories of the
potentially producti-e areas and of well defined forestry policies
on the part of the Governments. Furthermore, the potential of
traditional and competing timber producers is not well defined.
(b)  The estimates regarding an alternative route through the Cameroon
are of necessity tentative. The same applies to river transport.
The lack of a comprehensive forestry inventory and consequently
knowledge of wood densities is critical, because the river transporta-
tion costs for floatable logs (rafts) are less than half that for
high density woods which have to be transported by barge.
(c)  Other uncertainties relate to the future of COMILOG traffic,
value added estimates and foregone traffic due to higher trans-
portation costs and construction cost estimates.
21        Notwithstanding all these uncertainties, it is felt that final
engineering of the construction should proceed at an early date. Even under
very pessimistic departures from the best estimates, a sensitivity analysis
demonstrated the project's viability:
(a)  If investment costs are increased by 20% and no diversion and
value added benefits accrue between 1971 and 1975 due to slower
traffic growth and, consequently, sufficient capacity on the exist-
ing line and if benefits from 1976 through 1996 are reduced by
25%, the internal rate of return is 13.8%.
(b)  Alternatively, if investment costs are increased by 20% and all
benefits between 1980 and 1996 are deleted because COMILOG traffic
as of 1980 is diverted to another route and, consequently, there
is no capacity restraint during this period, the internal rate
of return is 18.2%.
(c)  If, in addition to (b) preceding, benefits through 1980 are
reduced by 10% due to the slower development of timber traffic,
the internal rate of return is 12.4%.

Draft Terms of Reference for Traffic Costing Study
I. OBJECTIVES
The purpose of this study is to (a) provide the Agence Transcongo-
laise des Communications (ATC) with essential costing information by type of
service and commodity so that it can apply a flexible commercial policy in
each of its sections - the port of Pointe Noire, the Congo Ocean Railway
(CFCO) and the river ports and river navigation, in line with the economic
requirements of the country and the financial needs of ATC; (b) evaluate the
extent to which the proposed investments and improvements to the ATC trans-
port system will benefit the Congolese economy and other countries and users;
Cc) recommend an appropriate pricing policy in the light of this evaluation;
and (d) assess the long-term market prospects for forestry production within
ATC's area of influence.
iI.  SCOPE OF STUDY
A.   General
The Consultants shall perform all economic, financial and technical
studies described herein, as required to achieve the objectives set forth in
Section I above. The Consultants shall conduct these studies with the full
cooperation of the ATC and the Government, which will provide the data and
services outlined in Section III following. The Consultants shall be solely
responsible, however, for the analysis and interpretation of all data received
or collected artd for the conclusions and recommendations contained in their
reports.
The study shall include detailed analysis of:
(1) the economic and financial costs involved in the use and
operation of each of ATC's transport services, including
those non-transport costs (warehousing, storage and forestry
production costs) which affect the level of investment in
transport facilities and the cost of their operation;
(2) the future costs of each of these services in the light
of traffic forecasts, overall long-term investment plans
and other factors likely to affect the operating costs and
other expenses of ATC;



ANNEX 7
Page 2
(3) in the light of ATC's long-term investment programs,
efficiency improvements and capacitv increases, an
assessment of the resulting net economic benefits
accruing to the Congolese economy and to the economies
of each of the countries which utilize ATC's facilities;
particular attention shall be given in assessing the
benefits to COMILOG and the forestry industries;
(4) the long-term market prospects for forestry production,
in the present and potential area of influence of ATC's
transport system, taking into account prospective world
market conditions, transport costs, and forestrv produc-
tion costs including taxes; the evaluation will include
the preparation of long-range (at least 20 years) traffic
forecasts of forestry products to be transported by each
of ATC's sections;
(5) the appropriate structure and level of tariffs, fees etc.,
for each one of ATC's services (including the manner and
timing of introducing appropriate tariff changes), which
would allow ATC to be financially viable and would promote
the efficient allocation of resources in the transport
sector of the Congo, other user countries and the region
as a whole. In achieving this, the study shall bear in
mind ATC's competitive position vis-a-vis existing or
potential alternative routes in the Congo and adjoining
countries.
Traffic forecasts, with the exception of forestry products (as
outlined in section (3) above), shall be prepared by ATC. However, in the
light of the effect on traffic of the costs and tariffs arrived at in this
study, the Consultants shall, as appropriate, recommend changes in these
forecasts.
The scope of this study does not comprise the preparation of de-
tailed investment programs for transport development. The study, however,
shall take into account ATC's investment plans and policies and assess the
effects of the recommendations on such plans and policies. In addition, the
Consultants shall review in broad terms the recommendations of recently com-
pleted studies concerning ATC, namely (a) the feasibility study for improve-
ments to the CPCO railway (TECSULT), (b) the master plan study for the port
of Pointe Noire (BCEOM); and (c) the feasibility study of improvements to
river navigation (SEDES). If required for attaining the objectives of this
study, the Consultants shall update and supplement the conclusions of the
above mentioned studies.



ANNEX 7
Page 3
B.   Present Costs
The study shall include:
(1)  Detailed analysis of the existing costing data for each
of ATC's services;
(2)  Determination of the relevance and adequacy of all charges
included in the operating accounts, in particular, public
and social service obligations and the provision for de-
preciation of fixed assets;
(3)  Valuation of assets to the extent required for making
tariff proposals, bearing in mind, however, the possi-
bility of this leading into a future detailed revaluation
of assets for accounting purposes; the valuation should
therefore be done by individual assets or, where convenient
and appropriate, by groups or classes of assets showing:
(a) gross value of depreciable assets based on costs
of replacements;
(b)  net value of depreciable assets:  the above cost
less accumulated replacement cost depreciation
calculated on useful life;
(c) gross value of any non-depreciable assets.
C.   Analysis of Present Costs
The study shall include:
(1)  Definition of the purpose of, and methodology to be
adopted in, making special tests to determine costs. or
factors to be used in the separation of costs, in those
cases where expenditure analysis and statistical data
prepared under existing rules are insufficiently detailed
for costing purposes;
(2)  Separation of operating expenditure, including deprecia-
tion of fixed assets, and financial charges between fixed
and variable costs,
(3)  Separation of the varl'able Costs between freight and
passenger services;
(4)  Separation of variable freight costs between terninal
services (documentation, freight-shed handling, shunting
in sidings, marshalling, etc.) and main-line haulage;



ANNEX 7
Page 4
(5) Determination of variable freight costs by individual com-
modities, or group of commodities (such as manganese,
timber and timber products and other major items). due
regard being given to the cost characteristics of the
route and sections traversed, for various size shipments,
empty car movements, loadability, length of haul, im-
balanced loading, use of privately-owned equipment, average
train-load, necessity to remarshall en route and other
relevant factors;
(6) Determination of variable cost of passenger services
by class of travel.
D.   Competing Modes
The study shall include assessment of the probable costs of com-
peting modes of transport, both actual and potential, for the major cate-
gories of traffic, including transit traffic.
E.   Future Cost Trends
The study shall include:
(1) Assessment of the extent to which increased traffic as
forecast by ATC will affect costs;
(2) Assessment of the extent to which improvements to the
ATC system will affect costs.
F.   Structure and Level of Freight and Passenger Rates
The study shall include:
(1) Recommendation of a structure and level of rates and fares
which, taking into account the trend of costs and demand
factors, would encourage the optimum use of ATC's facilities,
