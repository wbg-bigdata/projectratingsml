4.      Albania's very constrained public f'inances cannot siniultanteously operate the educationi system
and address all its urgent and widespread school rehabilitation need. Thle MOE's cstimiated total
budgetary expenditure for 1993 of USS42.0 million was 8.4 percent of total state expenditure and 3.7
percent of GDP. This is a siggnificanit expenlditure effort when comilpared to couiltries of similar per

million systemwide. Interinal inefficiency of the sector is exacerbating problemiis oi rcsources.
Student:teacher ratios have been declining sinice the 1980s: in 1992 the numibher- ol teachlers exceeded
the reasonable levels of 1985 bv miore hdin 10).00 posiliois, at an estimated annual cost of UISS4. ^
million, as enrollmenits contracted more rapidly than the teachili loirce cculd be adjusted.
Educational administration is in flux, reflectinig Albania's broader decenitralizatioin el'YOrts. I (evels of
governance in schooling--currenrtly five. excluding schools theemselves--are excessive and
cumbersome. Population niovements and sihifts in transportation services are also contributinig to
some transitionial inefficiencv in operation and the location of village schools.
5.     Preserving the base of the education systenm is only the first part of Albania's chiallenige. A,s
in othler post-socialist countries, m.ajor realignnient is also needed in the nmediun-ternm tn educational
programs. especially in techinical and higher education. The ciiurent stock ot skills and knowledge of
the labor force--and the curricula and teachinig practice which helped shape it--still reflect Albania's
economic and political past and its extreme isolation fronm the outside wvorld. An uncertain outlook in
industry makes it difficult for the Government and individuals to make informed investimient de-isionls
about work-related education and trainiig, beyond what is seen to be an im)portanit basic cducation for
the agricultural economy and the emerging service sector. The MOE and its Pedagogic Institute. the
key central institutions, lack the knowledge to conceptualize their new roles in sector leadership and
the tools to cost optionls and tradeoffs for improving the quality and efficiency of the education
system.
6.     Goverirnenit Strategy. The MOE is begirminlg to move beyond "coping" with transition to a
more strategic approach to sector managemenit. Its near-ternm priority is rehabilitation of the physical
plant. Given limited investment resources. the highest priority is rightly being givell to inputs to
eight-year schools, where enrollments appear sustainable and where relativel) less curricular
restructuring is required. Rehabilitation investment for secondary and pre-schools will be intensified
later. once policy, locational and curricular frameworks are clearer. New buildings and supplies
alone are unlikely to rescue enrollments and ensure quality education in these subsectors.
Governrment investment in school rehabilitation is expected to rise from USS3.7 million in 1993 to
about USS5.0 million equivalent in 1994, represenitinig about 4 percent of Albania's total public
investment. Restructuring of education programiis. or at least the conceptual design of such reforms,
is beginning at all ievels of the system. The Government has drafted new legislation which provides
a framework for the education system, and the Parliament has recentl) passed a separate law on
higher education. MOE has decided this year to establish a Council on Education Reform and
Management to help integrate and advance sector restructuring efforts. The MOE is shifting
resources from the vocational to the academic component of the system through restructuring of
secondary education with closure or conversion of obsolete vocational schools and more than doubling
the number of general secondary schools. The MOE is in the process of removing the ideological
influence on the content of education by organizing "emergency" rewriting of texts, especially in the
social sciences. Steps have also been taken to disentangle public bureaucracy in textbook provision,
improve supply and pave the way for a greater private sector role in publishing and printing
textbooks. MOE is taking measures to increase efficiency of student:teacher ratios by raising the
minimum number of pupils per teacher per class and expanding the use of collective classes. Lavoffs
will be concentrated on unqualified teachers, where positions can be eliminated without reducing vital
education services.

7.     Rationale for IDA lnvolvement. Preventing further deterioratioll of the base of thc education
pyramid is critical to ensure short-term political sustainabilitv of tranisitioni and to slhorc up Alballia's
long-term growthA prospects. The labor force entrants of the year 2005 are already enirolled, or should
be. Thle Government and the donor community are attemipting to respond, but intermittenit, piecemeal
eftorts, and lack of local experience with im1plemenitation of external assistance are hilderilig
sectorwide progress. There is an urgent need for strategic planning in the sector. develomnent of'
local capacity and staged, flexible implementation of rehabilitation efforts. Of doinors actn*ve in
Albania, the World Bank hias by far the greatest experience in providing countries sustaineJl s':pport
in all these areas.
8      Core elements of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Albania, discussed hy thfe Board
on September 14, 1993, are the "r^scuing" of basic public services and capacity-building of
indispensable government agencies. This initial project is consistent with the CAS by comlbininig a
quick-response approach to urgent school rehabilitation needs with limited, focuse(d technical
assistance and training aimed at building local capacity in strategic policy and program management.
During project preparation, Lssistance has been provided on outlining longer-term options for sectDr
rehabilitation and restructuring, and the education sector investment program.
9.     IDA assistance is also helping to attract and facilitate other donors' support. Japan Grant
funding has been used to assist the MOE in tstablishing a data base on school infrastructure
rehabilitation requirements, seiting up an implementation mechanism for school rehabilitation, and
launching the capacity-building activities. This preparatory work is facilitating parallel financing by
the Soros Foundation, which is considering a major commitment that will be launched in 1994 with a
pilot project of US$9.0 million for rehabilitation of 8-year schools, by the European Union which is
programming about ECU 6 million for school rehabilitation, and by UNICEF which is funding repair
of pre-school buildings. Swiss Grant funding managed by IDA is providing technical assistance for
planning the restructuring of secondary education, focusing on shiftirg the system toward less
emphasis on agricultural vocational programs and more on general and appropriate technical
education. This parallel activity is expected to lay a foundation for follow-up investments in
rehabilitation and implementation of new curriculum in middle schools.
10.    Proiect Objectives and Description. The Project will help the Government to sustain delivery
of basic education services during Albania's difficult economic transition and to build institutional
capacity for planning, management and quality assurance of education in an increasingly decentralized
system. Its specific objectives aie to: (a) accelerate rehabilitation of damaged and dilapidated eight-
year school facilities in Albania's 37 districts; and (b) build capacity of MOE to stimulate efficient use
of fiscal resources and assure quality of learning outcomes.
11.    Part A: School Rehabilitation (US$10.3 million"'):  The proposed IDA financing will
intensify implementation of the Government's school rehabilitation program. Project funds will be
allocated as follows: (i) School Repair Program (about 65 percent of base cost) to complete repairs of
buildings and basic school furniture in selected schools in all districts, covering an estimated 237
schools countrywide, or about 20 percent of repair requirements at the primaiy school level; an/'
(ii) School Replacement Program (about 35 percent of base cost) to complete all bailding repla.cment
requirements in the northern districts of Kukes, Puke and Shkoder, covering about 38 scr .ols, or 10
percent of net nationwide school replacement requirements. Prototype school builaing designs,
already completed and reviewed by IDA, will be used in school replacement, with local adaptations as

of implementation. gener-atling policy recomilmenidationis and action plans that can be financed hv IDA
and other donors. The Project will also establish a ProjgetCoordination Unit (PCU) for major
externally funded activities in school rehabilitationi and capacity-building.
14.      Finaticing. Total project ccsts are estimated at USSI 1.3 million, including contingencies
and taxes. The proposed IDA credit of SDR 6.9 million (USS9.6 million equivalent) will finance 100
percent of foreign costs and 87 percetlt of local costs. Government financing of USS1.7 million will
cover part of sclhool rehabilitationi incremental salary and other recurrent costs, and taxes.
Maintenance costs of rehabilitated sclhools will be fully finaniced bh the Government under MOE's
annual recurrent budget. Estimated project costs and financing plani are shown in Schedule A.
Schedule B describes procurement mrtlhods and disbursemiients. A Project Preparation Facility (PPF)
advance of USS125,000 is being used to establish the project coordination mechaniisms. To help
ensure that maximum use is niade of the 1904 summer construction season, retroactive finanicing of
up to US$900,000 equivalent will be provided for eligible expenditures incurred after January 31,
1994.
15.      Implementation. Over the four-year project, implementation will be coordinated by MOE,
relying on its existing network of district units for school supply/building works (Economic Centers)
to manage the School Rehabilitation Component. The Economic Centers, with some involvement of
the MOE/PCU on larger packages. will be responsible for civil works and school fLurniture
procurement. The Econiomic Centers will use local contracting procedures adapted from those already
in use under the Albania Housing Project. The Economic Centers' building engineers will supervise

17.      Agreed Actions. Durinig negotiations, tihe Government provided assuranices:
that schools to be covered in the SchIool Repair Progranm  will be selected hb the lC0cono(1ic Centers
only if they have: (a) a certificate firomii the relevant disirict confirminig iat the school cd school site.
with land title, is permanienit within the district, (b) an approval of the Econ3omic Center on the
structural soundness of the school: and (c, an assurance from the sciool managemenit on building
maintenance and security. Priority will be given to the schools with the higilest student per c!assroom
ratio. In its annual budget subm]lissioni to Parliament. the Goverfnient will maintaini recurrent
expenditures for eight-year education, expressed as a percentage of overall recurrent expenditures, at
a level at least equivalent to that provided in 1994 (4.2 percent). The Government p)ovided furth,er
assurances that by November 30 e.ch year: (a) it will provide IDA with the detailed programn for
school repair/replacement in the forthcominig  ear: and (bt it will review joily with IDA the (i) draft
education sector bu -et and sources of fminoncinig, and (ii) the progress in implemeniting the adjustment
of teacher naimbers. includinig moniitoring of the absolute number of teachers in the sector and trends
in student:teacher ratios at all levels. By June 30. 1996, tihe Government will undertake jointly with
IDA a mid-term review of the Project.
18.      Environimenital Aspects. Thlis is a Category C Projeci. The Project is expected to have a
beneficial environimental impact thioughi improved saniitationi facilities in ihe relhabilitated schools.
Environmental considerations, especially use of appropriate local materials for scihool conistr-uctioni and
maintenance, wili be factored inito sch0ool huilding qualit) standards.
19.      Programii Objective Categories. Thie Project supports the Government's policy oi'
rehabilitatinig school infrastructure. w ith priority given to eight-year schools. and improv ing
institutional management in the areas of resource planning. quality assurance, and staff' development.
The Project falls into one category: Poverty Reduction and Human Resource Development
(100 percent).
20.      Benefits, The benefits of this first phase of IDA assistance will derive chiefly from
rehabilitation of facilities. Functional buildings anu classrooms newly refurbished with windov,s,
heaters and basic furniture will help to preserve essenitiai educational services. Improved facilities
will remove a major disincentive for school attendanice and impediments to teaching and learning.



-6-
The capacity-building activities will begin the longer-term process of developing the professional
capability of central-level institutions and helping the Government to better maniage the activities of
external donors cffering assistance for education. Development of a textbook provision policy and an
approach to restructuring the organization of publishing, printing and distributing textbooks is
expected to lead to greater involvement of the private sector in educational publishing.
21.      Risks. The principal risk lies in the capability of the MOE and its district level agencies to
carry out quickly an intensive school rehabilitation program in Albania's present conditions and with
inputs from several major donors. Even if local institutions are well-organized and technical
preparation is thorough, the country's severely handicapped transport, communications and bankinig
infrastructure, and center versus local administration frictions may pose formidable obstacles. rhis
risk is mitigated somewhat by MOE's exparience in 1993 with implementation of school rehabilitation
with budgetary funds, most of which was undertaken via local competitive coniracting.
Implementat.on mechanisms for IDA-rinanced school rehabilitation are being rooted in existing
institutions and local procedures. Allbania's major external partners in education--IDA, European
Union, Soros Foundation, and UNICEF--are collaborating to avoid potential duplication of effort. to
be mindful of local absorptive capacity, and to develop jointlv procurement and implementationi
processes that are effective under local conditions. An additional risk is that rehabilitated buildings
could fall prey to pilfering and neglect, as in the past. Selection of schools to be covered under the
Project will favor communities where there is already evidence of school security arrangements and
regular maintenance. IDA will also review annually withi the Government the arrangements for
financing preventive maintenance in the education system.
22.    Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit will com-ply with the Articles of
Agreement and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
