MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA
FOR AN EMERGENCY RECONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommenoation on a proposed development
credit to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for SDR 55 million
(US$78 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity, and would help finance
an emergency reconstruction and rehabilitation project.
2.      Background: The ethnic conflict that flared up in July 1983 has
slowed down economic growth and the impressive advances that were being made
under the liberalization measures introduced since 1977. The hostilities
have claimed over 7,000 lives, caused considerable damage to movable and
immovable property, and resulted in the displacement of over 500,000 persons,
inside and outside the country. The strife exerted serious strains on the
economy of the country and slowed down developmental activities.
3.      Following the Peace Agreement signed in July 1987, major hostilities
have subsided except that during October and November 1987 there was an
increase in fighting in the Jaffna a d Batticaloa areas.  Refugees have
started to return from abroad and the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) has
commenced relief activities to help refugees and persons displaced by the
conflict make a new start in life. At the request of GOSL, an IDA mission
visited Sri Lanka in September 1987 to assess the damage, prepare a Recon-
struction and Rehabilitation Program report for a Special Aid Group meeting
and to identify an Emergency keconstruztion and Rehabilitation Project within
the Program to be financed by IDA. The project was appraised in
October/November 1987. A major economic policy concern was to ensure that
the Reconstruction Program could be arcommodated within the public investment
program without creating unmanageable fiscal pressures. In its November 1987
Budget Statement for FY 1988, GOSL has announced a macro-economic policy
framework which includes the gradual decline in the central government fiscal
deficit from around 12% of GDP in FY87 to about 9% of GDP in FY90. The
necessary decline in deficits would be achieved mainly through cuts in public
expenditure (particularly defense expenditures) and would allow for the
financing of the Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Program. Joint Bank/IMF
discussions on a Policy Framework Paper to be supported by an IMF Structural
Adjustment Facility are at an advanced stage. Discussions between the Bank,
IMF and the Government have been finalized. A Policy Framework Paper was
discussed by the Board on February 18, 1988. In addition, the Bank (a)
organized the Special Aid Group meeting; and will coordinate mobilization of
resources for the Program; (b) agreed to consider restarting suspended
projects when conditions permit and to reallocate savings from on-going
projects; and (c) processed a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) in the



-2-
amount of US$ 750,000 to help meet immediate expenditures of project prepara-
tion, as requested by GOSL.
4.      Damage:  Losses and destruction have been caused due to the direct
effects of explosions, arson, rioting and looting, and the indirect effects
of neglected maintenance and the slowdown of economic activities. The
rehabilitation and reconstruction needs have been estimated at about
US$490 million (including the additional damages incurred during the post
Peace Agreement fighting) and cover the following sectors: housing, roads and
bridges, public transport, public buildings, railways, ports, agriculture,
fisheries, telecommunications, education, health, irrigation, water supply
and public and private commercial activities and industry.
5.      Government Response:  GOSL, assisted by a number of bilateral agen-
cies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), has commenced relief operations for retur-
nees and has taken action to reestablish basic services.  Returning refugee
households are provided transport and a relief package totalling about Rs
25,000 equivalent which includes Rs 15,000 for shelter, Rs 6,000 for dry
rations for six months, Rs 2,000 in resettlement allowance, and Rs 2,000 to
restart economic activities.  Funds have also been provided for temporary
school buildings and clinics. On a para'lel front, GOSL has approved the
creation of provincial councils involving a substantial devolution of power.
6.      Response from Donors:  At the Special Aid G-vup meeting on December
4, 1987, donors indicated they were prepared to cc-asi-er assistance amounting
to about US$490 million to finance the Program.
7.      Program Implementation:  A National Re,:onstruction Steering Committee
(NRSC) and District Reconstruction Coordinating Committees (DRCCs) have been
set up. The NRSC, set up in the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP),
will provide overall coordination, evaluation, monitoring, and financial and
administrative approval for projects. It will be conmplemented by a full-time
secretariat comprising management and technical experts and support-staff.
DRCCs have been set up in the worst affected districts to propose and
prioritize projects, arrange project preparation through line ministries and
coordinate implementation. In the most affected districts, the DRCCs will
have full-time secretariats comprising technical and support staff as
required.  Detailed preparation and design of specific components are being
carried out with the help of consultants.  Government Agents (Central Govern-
ment representatives in the districts) will head the DRCCs and will be mem-
bers of the NRSC. These arrangements are satisfactory to IDA.
8.      Rationale for IDA Involvement: Given IDA's long-standing development
role in Sri Lanka, it is well placed to take the lead in coordinating
resource mobilization activities to assist rebuilding economic, social and
physical systems under the Program. GOSL has requested IDA's help in coor-
dinating the reconstruction effort among donors, as well as in financing part



-3-
of the Program. GOSL recognizes the need to act quickly and positively to
consolidate the somewha: fragile peace and political situation that resulted
from the peace accord. IDA's involvement would support this important
Government objective and help promote stability and resumption of economic
activity.
9.      Project Objectives.  The proposed project aims to deliver immediate
assistance to GOSL to assist returnees, revive economic activities and
restore essential services that would facilitate the reconstruction and
rehabilitation process in areas throughout Sri Lanka affected by the strife.
10.     Proposed Project and Description:  The project, to be implemented
over a three-year period, would provide funds for: (a) civil works; (b)
equipment and materials; (c) credit (for shelter, industry and small scale
enterprises); and (d) consulting services and technical assistance. Summary
cost estimates are given in the table below, while more detailed estimates
and the financing plan are given in Schedule A.
Component                      US$ Millions :
Site Preparation                         1.0
Shelter                                 29.0
Industry                                17.0
Telecommunications                      11.0
Infrastructure                         34.0
Technical Assistance                     3.0
Project Administration                   4.0
Total Base Costs                  99.0
Contingencies                           12.0
111.0
i Rounded to nearest million.
11.     Through its regular project lending, IDA is active in all of the
above sectors except industry (cement) and shelter, and has, in general, a
satisfactory policy dialogue in them. The investment in equipment proposed
for the cement plants will result in lower unit costs and a more competi-
tively priced product than at present. This investment forms part of a
larger program of restructuring and management improvement to ensure economic
viability of the szctor, which is being addressed as part of the Bank's



-4-
on-going dialogue in Sri Lanka. IDA has not been involved to date in housing
largely because of earlier disagreements on policy, notably public sector
construction of subsidized apartments, interest rate policy and cost
recovery. GOSL no longer builds public housing and is now providing lines of
credit only for housing construction by the private sector. Since about
1980, US AID has financed part of GOSL's revamped housing program through its
Housing Guarantee Loan facility, and is successfully addressing the above
issues, with emphasis on policies designed to improve recovery performance.
The greatest loss and destruction in the conflict has been to housing, and
the IDA-financed housing component will support GOSL in its reconstruction
efforts in this sector as a complement to US AID and other potential donors.
12.     At the request of GOSL, a US$0.75 million PPF was processed for
recruitment of consultants to accelerate preparation of final designs and
bidding documents of major components, on the basis of agreed terms of
reference. UNDP Technical Assistance funds provide for additional project
preparation and implementation, and for staffing of the secretariats of the
NRSC and DRCCs.
13.     Financing: An IDA Credit of SDR 55 million (US$78 million equivalent)
is proposed to finance about 80% of total project cost, net of taxes and
duties. GOSL (through MOFP) will pass on the proceeds of the Credit, on
terms appropriate to the objectives of the project and satisfactory to IDA,
to the line ministries and agencies responsible for project execution.
Retroac.ive financing of an amount not exceeding SDR 5.5 million is proposed
for expenditures incurred from completion of appraisal, for consultants
services, equipment and civil works.
14.     Procurement:  The Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and
IDA Credits would be followed for procuremenc of goods and works. The
Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World
Bank as Executing Agency would be followed for retaining consultants.   0
Schedule B gives details of the specific procurement procedures to be fol-
lowed for each component of the project.
15.     Agreed Actions:  The Government of Sri Lanka agreed to: (a) arrange
for clearance of rubble and defusing of explosive devices, a priority aLtion
to be implemented prior to commencement of works; (b) implement the project
over three years; (c) strengthen, where necessary, the capacity of agencies
to implement the Program; and (d) arrange for adequate funds to be made
available to operate and maintain assets reconstructed/rehabilitated under
the Program.
16.     Benefits:  In the wake of the July Peace Agreement, citizens have
started to return to the Northern and Eastern Provinces. The project will
help them re-establish their roots, return to active employment, start
economic activities and accelerate the process of returning the region to a
state of niormalcy. Economic returns are likely to be substantial. The



-5-
cleanup operations proposed for the most affected towns would assist general
improvement of the environment. The next stage improvements that would
follow the _nputs proposed for the two cement plants in Jaffna would address
issues of land restoration, air pollution and restructuring.
17.     Risks:  Major risks are that the peace process may falter and that
implementation capacity would be inadequate to deliver the outputs in the
agreed timeEraae.  Technical assistance would be made available to help
ensure that the timetable for implementation is adhered to as far as pos-
sible. An additional risk is that there might not be effective local level
involvement in reconstruction activities which would result in frustration
and accusations of inequity or preferential treatment. GOSL is cognizant of
this and has arranged for special coordination arrangements between the
center and the districts, and among districts.
18.     Recommendation:  I am satisfied that the proposed credit of SDh 55
million would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and
recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

TECHNICAL ANNEX
SRI LANKA
EMERGENCY RECONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
A. BACKGROUND
1.      The Peace Agreement signed on July 29, 1987 aims at putting an end to
a four year bitter and costly conflict that caused extensive damages
predominantly in the Northern and Eastern parts of the country, and which put
a severe strain on the economy. The Agreement provides for a considerable
degree of adn. nistrative autonomy to the Provinces, Tamil to be an official
language, and agreement on procedures to determine the ethnic composition of
all land settlement schemes. Except for a brief period in October and Novem-
ber 1987, hostilities have subsided and refugees from abroad and people
displaced by the conflict have started to return to their former areas of
habitation.
2.      The ethnic conflict accounted for the loss of over 7,000 lives with
thousands more wounded. Over 500,000 people lost their homes. Schools,
hospitals and clinics were damaged, resulting in serious hardship to children
and patients.  Many workplaces were destroyed or damaged with consequent
I         disruption of activities in all sectors of the economy--farming, fishing,
manufacturing, transport and trade. The conflict put a heavy burden on both
the budget and the balance of payments. The total losses to the economy
since July 1983 are estimated at about Rs 55 billion (US$1.8 billion), and
include Rs 21 billion (US$700 million) in physical damage, Rs 15 billion
(US$500 million) on security forces, Rs 7 billion (US$230 million) in fishing
and agriculture, Rs 6 billion (US$200 million) in potential foreign exchange
investment, and Rs 6 billion (US$200 million) due to a decline in tourism.
3.      The Government of Sri Lanka intends to rehabilitate all parts of the
country that suffered from the conflict and bring them back to normalcy as
quickly as possible. This requires rehabilitating damaged infrastructure,
getting displaced people back to work, and facilitating the start of economic
activities. A sector-wide assessment made in September 1987 of rehabilita-
tion and reconstruction needs for the next four years was as follows (in
millions): Roads and Bridges US$70; Public Transport US$10; Covernment Tran-
sport Vehicles US$5; Public Buildings US$15; Housing US$75; Schools US$8;
Health Centers, Hospitals US$4; Agriculture US$50; Fisheries US$17; Irriga-
tion US$9; Water Supply US$15; Industry (Public Sector) US$6; Private
Irndustry US$5; Railways US$18; Telecommunications US$40; Power US$15; Others
(not yet quantified) US$30. The total (inclusive of contingencies) was about
US$390.  In addition, the flare up of hostilities in October 1987 increased



-12-
the reconstruction needs by at least another US$100 million, according to
GOSL estimates.
B. BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY
4.      The Bank's response and strategy has been to: (a) assist the Govern-
ment to identify an Emergency Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Program
within GOSL's structural adjustment efforts (Report 6998-CE dated November
16, 1987); (b) organize a Special Aid Group meeting (Paris, December 4,
1987); (c) coordinate the mobilization of resources required for the program;
(d) ensure that priority is given to activities that have the highest
economic benefit and those that facilitate quick return to normalcy; (e)
limit, together with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), its intervention to
major components, leaving the social sectors generally to bilateral and other
donor agencies; (f) ensure that reconstruction is undertaken in an equitable
manner, covering all affected areas; (g) consider restarting suspended
projects when conditions permit and reallocate any savings from on-going
projects; and (h) process a PPF of US$750,000 to meet immediate expenditures
of project preparation (approved on November 12, 1987).
5.      The background and rationale for selection of components are
described briefly in this paragraph. Reconstruction on public and private
land can only commence after the areas are made safe, rubble removed and
disposed of in a proper manner. This task is clearly too large to be left to
individuals.  Housing was the most extensively damaged sector, with damage
amounting to about US$75 million.  About 100,000 rural and urban premises of
all categories of construction (thatch ... brick and mortar) were partly or
totally destroyed, 60% of which belonged to the lower income families. The
shelter reconstruction program of Government and donors is unlikely to meet
all the needs. According to preliminary estimates, 11,300 commercial
businesses were damaged, of which about 8,000 were completely destroyed. The
full extent of damage to private sector industries and manufacturing estab-
lishments is still being compiled. Damage has been tentatively estimated at
about Rs 700 million (US$23.5 million). This amount represents structural
losses; it does not include lost working capital, tools and stocks. Insurance
compensation is not likely to be a significant factor as insurance companies
were not prepared to insure against strife or civil commotion. About 14,000
subscribers have lost access to telecommunications service, of whom about
8,000 are in the Jaffna and Trincomalee districts. Revival of economic
activities is bound to greatly facilitate the process of rehabilitation. The
need for improvement of communications to support economic activity provides
justification for inclusion of roads and telecommunications in the project.

C.  DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
6.      Components included in the proposed project are:  (a) those that
would help promote economic activities and hence provide employment oppor-
tunities; and (b) infrastructure that would facilitate economic and social
activities and accelerate return to normalcy. The project includes six
components as described below:
(i) Site Preparation (US$1.0 million) As a prerequisite for reconstruc-
tion, the project provides for the defusing of explosive devices
followed by the clearance of building rubble from public and private
areas in a methodical manner with disposal at approved dumps, to
achieve a good environment for living, and co remove as quickly as
possible the scars of the conflict. As rubble clearance by heavy
earthmoving equipment is likely to displace boundary markers of plots
(hence the road reserves), the project also provides for the restora-
tion of survey pegs (markers) to facilitate the reconstruction
effort. The clearance of rubble would be organized by urban local
authorities in the affected towns. They would provide opportunities
for the citizens to salvage building materials and obtain temporary
employment. The defusing of explosive devices would be coordinated
with the defense forces.
(ii)   Shelter (US$29 million).  The project would fund a part of COSL's
shelter reconstruction program under two existing loan programs.
COSL, UNHCR, NCOs and bilaterals would fund the balance, including
the shelter grants (para 5, page 2).  Project inputs are made up of
about US$22 million under a rehabilitation scheme (REPPIA) and about
US$7 million under the on-going Million Houses Program (MHP). REPPIA
(Rehabilitation of Persons, Properties and Industries Authority)
loans would be for up to 20-years at interest rates of 6% p.a., 4%
p.a. and 2% p.a. with loan limits of Rs 150,000, Rs 100,000 and Rs
75,000 for households with monthly incomes of over Rs 5,000, between
Rs 5,000 and Rs 2,501 arid between Rs 2,500 and 1,501, respectively.
The funds would be lent through the State Mortgage and Investment
Bank (SMIB), the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and
the Bank of Ceylon (BOC), using their standard loan processing proce-
dures.   Affected households with monthly incomes between Rs 1,500
and Rs 701 would receive loans up to Rs 15,000 at an interest rate of
2% p.a. for up to 15 years from the National Housing Development
Authority (NHDA) under REPPIA. Loans for shelter reconstruction
under the MHP would be for up to 15 years at interest rates varying
between 3% p.a. and 10% p.a. depending on loan amount, with loan
limits of up to Rs 15,000 and up to Rs 7,500 for urban and rural
beneficiaries, respectively; loans for utilities (e.g. water supply,
sanitation, electricity, etc.) would be repayable in five years. The
MHP is administered by NHDA in urban areas and through thrift and
credit cooperative societies (TCCS) in rural areas. Over the past



-14-
four years, the share of MHP to the North and East has been substan-
tially reduced due to implementation problems and budget cutbacks.
IDA's input would therefore give a greater share to the North and
East, contribute to economic revival there, and complement a success-
ful shelter program. The project's lines of credit for shelter is
illustrated in the following table.

(iii) Assistance to Industry (US$17 million). This component would provide
(a) credit facilities for restarting industries using REPPIA loans
(US$4.8 million); Small and Medium Industry (SMI) loans (US$4.8
million); and credit through NCOs to low income groups (US$ 1.8
million); and (b) assistance to two cement plants in Jaffna to
rehabilitate and expand their operations (US$5.6 million). The
details of credit facilities proposed are set out in the table below.

Two cement plants, Sri Lanka Cement Corporation (SLCC) and Lanka
Cement Limited (LC), would be provided US$5.6 million to repair and
replace damaged buildings and equipment and to rationalize the lime-
stone extraction process at Kankesanthurai to enable the plants to
operate closer to their installed capacity of 500,000 tons per annum.
The inputs in quarrying equipment would achieve an increase of
300,000 tons per annum over: present levels of production through the
modification of the extraction process. To ensure economic viability
of the sector, two actions are required over the medium term: (i)
facilities at the newest plant (in Jaffna) should be completed so as
to reach its initially designed capacity, and (ii) a financial
restructuring of the industry would be necessary. COSL is currently
addressing these matters.
(iv) Infrastructure (US$48 million).  Five sub-components are included
under infrastructure, as follows:
(a) Roads (US$33 million). This sub-component deals with district
roads falling under the jurisdiction of the Road Development
Authority (RDA). The project would include reconstruction and
rehabilitation of about 825 kilometers of roads (inciuding
culverts), 32 bridges, with spans ranging between five meters
and 139 meters, 2 passenger launches, road construction equip-
ment and vehicles. The road program comprises a range of works
which includes reconstruction, patching, repairs, surfacing,
graveling and on-going maintenance.



-16-
(b) Urban Infrastructure - North and East (US$8 million). The towns
most damaged through the direct effects of the war, e.g. Jaf-
fna, Point Pedro, Velvettiturai, Chavakachcheri, Manipay, Kopay,
would be provided funds under the project to reconstruct and
rehabilitate roads, drainage, water supply, street lighting,
power distribution systems, markets and civic buildings. In
view of the extensive damage that has occurred, a limited town
planning exercise would be undertaken to review efficient loca-
tion of infrastructure and facilities. No major replanning or
relocation of residential areas would be included.
(c) Public Buildings - Other Towns (US$3.5 million). Funds would
be provided to repair and reconstruct infrastructure damage in
eleven municipal and urban councils and pradeshiya sabhas out-
side the North and East, those buildings belonging to the Dis-
trict Administration, and post offices, islandwide. The works
include repair and reconstruction of buildings and infrastruc-
ture, and repair and replacement of equiment.
(d)  Equipment for Municipal Services (US$2 million).  Assistance
would be provided to the municipal and urban councils and
pradeshiya sabha, f Jaffna, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Vavuniya,
Mannar, Kilinochc.i and Mullaitivu to restart essential
municipal services such as retuse collection, through the supply
of equipment. Equipment would include 24 refuse vehicles, 24
tippers, two front-end loaders, eight light vans and 400 hand-
carts.
te)  Vehicles for GovernmentDepartments (US$1.5 million).  The
project would provide transport vehicles to central, regional
and district-level agencies to replace those damaged or lost
during the conflict, to enable them to become mobile and carry
out government business as part of the return to normalcy. The
vehicles to be provided include 10 cars, 10 jeeps and 80 pickup
vans.
(v) Telecommunications (US$13 million). The rehabilitation of telecom-
munications is planned as a two-stage process. The main program
(estimated at US$44.1 million with a foreign exchange component of
about US$28.5 million) comprises Ci) installation of about 9,600
lines of digital switching equipment with associated transmission
links, cables and ancillary equipment in Jaffna, Trincomalee and five
other districts; (ii) a priority program to provide basic telephone
service to Jaffna and Trincomalee (which are presently totally
without service); and (iii) repairs and replacement of damaged equip-
ment, buildings and vehicles, islandwide. The priority program
(which is an integral part of the total program) would provide for



-17-
installation of remote subscriber units of 500 lines each at Jaffna
and Trincomalee, working off the existing Anuradhapura exchange over
digital transmission links. For reasons of technical compatibility
and the urgency of providing minimal service in Jaffna and Trin-
comalee, the equipment for the priority program, estimated to cost
US$7.0 million, is proposed to be procured from the original supplier
of the Anuradhapura exchat.ge. The project would finance the priority
program (US$7.0 million), and the replacement of stores used for
immediate repairs (US$6.0 million). The balance of the program would
be funded from bilateral sources.
(vi) Technical Assistance (US$4 million). UNDP has agreed to provide
about US$2.8 million of technical assistance to support the NRSC,
DRCCs and other requirements. IDA has provided US$0.75 million under
the PPF and the project would include a further US$3.2 million for
other technical assistance and training requirements such as: (a)
contract staff for RDA's road reconstruction program; (b) local
consultant services for construction management of the road construc-
tion program; (c) feasibility study for the Mannar-Poonakary Road;
(d) study on the rationalization of or rations of two cement plants
at Kankesanthurai (LC and SLCC), and rinancial restructuring, joint
ownership, private management and expansion of LC; (e) consultant
services for supervision of planning, management and commissioning of
the telecommunications program; (f) study of land tenure and titles
and its impact on housing credit and contruction; (g) support for
tripartite reviews, resource mobilization and reporting to donor
agencies; and (h) procurement of equipment.
7.      Operational Action Plan.  A detailed list of administrative, finan-
cial and operational actions to accelerate implementation was discussed and
confirmed at negotiations. These have been grouped into an Operational
Action Plan (OAP).  GOSL confirmed at negotiations that the OAP will be
updated semi-annually, in a manner satisfactory to IDA.
D. INSTITUTIL4AL ARRANGEMENTS
9.      Organi   .ion.  The institutional arrangements developed for program
and project implementation take into account the concerns of the ultimate
beneficiaries and propose practical workable arrangements, given the
multi-sectoral nature of the Program and the involvement of three levels of
government (central, provincial and district).
10.     The following implementation arrangements have been confirmed by
GOSL:
(a) District Reconstruction Coordinating Committees (DRCC). About 14
DRCCs will be set up in the most affected districts. They will be
headed by the Government Agent (CA) who coordinates and monitors

development activity in the district, and are not expected to con-
flict with the devolution arrangements. The membership of a DRCC
will comprise district or regional heads of line ministries,
citizens' committee representatives, and NGOs. DRCCs will prioritize
reconstruction activity and monitor progress. Following prioritiza-
tion, DRCCs will authorize the local representatives of line minis-
tries and other agencies to prepare project proposals for approval by
the National Reconstruction Steering Committee (NRSC). Each DRCC
will be represented at the NRSC by its GA. The GAs of the worst
affected districts will be assisted by secretariats whose composition
of technical and support staff is satisfactory to IDA and UNDP.
(b) National Reconstruction Steering Committee (NRSC). The NRSC is
located in the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP), and has as
its Chairman, the Director of Planning. The membership of the NRSC
will comprise GAs from the 14 affected districts, development
secretaries of the main line ministries involved in reconstruction,
and the Ministries of Rehabilitation and Plan Implementation. Within
the framework of national policies and practices, the NRSC will
provide financial and administrative approval for pr ject proposals,
authorize fund transfers to implementing line ministries, monitor the
overall Reconstruction and Rehabi.itation Program and resolve any
disputes or bottlenecks.
11.     The NRSC and DRCC secretariats will have the following staff composi-
tion, agreed by GOSL, IDA and UNDP:
(a) NRSC: Chief Executive Officer, Chief Coordinator, Field Coordinator,
Sociologist, Engineer, Accountant, Accounts Assistants,
Administrator and support staff;
(b) DRCCs: Coordinator, Engineer, Accountant, Accounts Assistants and
support staff.
With the exception of the Chief Coordinator, all of the personnel would be
Sri Lankan nationals. The Chief Executive Officer has been appointed in
agreement with IDA. Assurances were received at negotiations that GOSL will
keep and maintain this position and exchange views with IDA and UNDP on any
proposed replacement, and changes in composition of NRSC and DRCCs. The
costs of the above managerial, technical and financial expertise will, inter
alia, be funded through a US$2.8 million UNDP technical assistance project.
UNDP's Office of Project Execution (OPE) will be the Executing Agency. The
Bank will be an Associate Agency and will assist OPE in implementation of the
technical assistance program. The NRSC will coordinate all activities under
the program, involving all dorors.
12.      Financing.  The proposed IDA Credit of US$78 million equivalent
would finance about 80% of total project costs, net of taxes and duties. It



-19-
would be lent to GOSL which would pass the funds on to line ministries and
implementing agencies on terms appropriate to the objectives of the project,
and confirmed at negotiations.
13.     Procurement.  Procurement of goods and services would be in accord-
ance with Bank guidelines and have been tailored to respond to the emergency
nature of the project.  Civil works contracts costing more than US$3 million
would be let following international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures.
Three contracts worth about US$12 million would be let on this basis. A
preferential margin of 7 1/2X would be allowed for local contractors in
evaluating such bids. Civil works contracts costing less than US$3 million,
up to an aggregate amount of about US$21 million, which are widely dispersed
and which would not attract foreign bidders, would be let following local
competitive bidding (LCB) procedures. These procedures have been found
satisfactory to IDA. Minor civil works such as rubble clearance and road
patching, in aggregate not exceeding US$1 million, would be executed through
force account.
14.     Goods contracts costing more than US$200,000, totalling about US$8
million, would be let following ICB procedures. Local manufacturers would be
given a preference of 15% of the c.i.f. value of imported items or the exist-
ing rate of customs duty, whichever is lower. Contracts for goods costing
less than US$200.000, up to an aggregate amount of about US$5 million, would
be let following LCB procedures, which have been found satisfactory to IDA.
Contracts for goods costing less than US$25,000, up to an aggregate amount of
about US$4 million, would be let through prudent shopping procedures covering
both imported and locally manufactured items. Contracts for telecommunica-
tions equipment for the priority program in the Jaffna and Trincomalee areas
would be leF through sole source procurement (US$7.0 million), and through
limited international bidding procedures for the replacement of stores used
for immediate repairs ($6.0 million).
15.     All bidding packages for civil works estimated to cost US$500,000 or
more, and all bidding packages for equipment and materials estimated to cost
US$200,000 or more, would be subject to IDA's prior review.
16.     Implementation and Disbursements.  The project would be implemented
over three years with disbursements extending over four years, ending Decem-
ber 31, 199,. The NRSC would coordinate disbursements of the Program and
project. The proceeds of the Credit would be disbursed against eligible
expenditures as follows: civil works - 85% of total expenditures in 1988 and
1989, 50% in 1990, and 15% in 1991; equipment and materials - 100% of foreign
expenditures, 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory) and 65% of local expen-
ditures for other items procured locally; loans (for shelter and industry) -
65%, and technical assistance - 100%. No disbursements would be made for
expenditures incurred by the military forces for the defusing of explosive
devices. The drawdown from the PPF plus accrued charges would be refinanced



-20-
through the Credit. Full documentation would be sent to IDA in support of
withdrawal applications except for (a) small civil works contracts costing
less than the equivalent US$200,000 each, (b) expenditures under force
account, and (c) loans. For such expenditures, withdrawal applications would
be supported by certified stat-ements of expenditure (SOEs). The documenta-
tion in support of SOEs would be retained by the NRSC and made available for
review to IDA rupresentatives on request. In addition, this documentation
will be subject to audit.
17.     A Special Account of SDR 4.4 million (US$6 million equivalent), equal
to about four months disbursements, would be established at the Central Bank.
NRSC would authorize line ministries to withdraw and utilize the funds in the
Special Account to facilitate payment of eligible expenditures.
18.     Accounts and Audits.  Government financial procedures will be fol-
lowed for management and accounting. The NRSC and participating line minis-
tries and agencies would maintain separate accounts and records for the
project. For all experditures for which withdrawals would be made on the
basis of SOEs, GOSL would arrange to maintain separate records and accounts.
Auditors acceptable to IDA would audit the project accounts each year. The
auditors' report would be sent to IDA within nine months of the close of each
fiscal year. It would include a separate opinion as to whether the funds
disbursed against SOEs have been used for the purposes for which they were
provided. Assurances were obtained 1uring negotiations that the accounting
and auditing requirements outlined above will be met.
E. AGREEMENTS REACHED
