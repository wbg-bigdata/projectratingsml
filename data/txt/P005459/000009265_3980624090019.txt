IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
MOROCCO
SECOND RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
(Loan 3262-MOR)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Second Rural Electrification
Project in Morocco for which Loan 3262-MOR in the amount of US$114 million was approved
on August 4, 1990 and signed June 14, 1991. The project was restructured, the loan amended on
November 12, 1992 and made effective on February 2, 1993. A total of US$ 77.5 million was
canceled from the loan upon request from the Borrower during 1996 and 1997, and the balance
fully disbursed. The loan was closed on June 30, 1997, as originally envisaged, and the last
disbursement occurred on October 31, 1997.
The ICR was prepared by Alvaro J. Covarrubias, Consultant, under the supervision of
Jorge A. Larrieu, Principal Power Engineer. The ICR was reviewed by the Country Operations
Department (MNCMG) and by the Infrastructure Development Group (MNSID).
The preparation of the ICR began in November 1997 followed by a mission carried out
by Mr. Covarrubias in early December 1997 (Appendix A: ICR Mission Aide-Memoire). ONE,
on behalf of the Government, provided the Borrower's project completion report in January 1998
(Appendix B: Borrower's Contribution to the ICR). The ICR is based on the Staff Appraisal
Report, the loan and project agreements, supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank
and the Borrower (the Government), the financing intermediary (FEC) and the executing agency
(ONE), intemal Bank memoranda, and interviews with Bank staff and Borrower, FEC and ONE
officials and staff involved in project preparation, appraisal and implementation.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
MOROCCO
SECOND RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
(Loan 3262-MOR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Objectives
1.    The main objectives of the project were to: (a) expand electricity supply to the rural areas;
(b) improve the reliability and quality of service of the existing rural distribution network; (c)
strengthen the administrative, planning and financial capabilities in the power sector; (d)
implement institutional reforms aimed at delineating and streamlining the responsibility for
planning, implementing, operating and managing the rural distribution system; and (e) encourage
further reforms in the electricity tariff structure. The project was also expected to contribute to
the Government's policy of improving the efficiency of energy consumption (para. 3).
2.    The physical objectives included construction of about 5,850 km of medium- and low-
voltage lines; installation of about 72OMVA in distribution transformers; construction of about
170,000 consumer connections in about 462 villages in 34 provinces; and the supply of vehicles
and specialized equipment for operating and maintaining the distribution network in the newly
electrified villages. The institutional objectives included a technical assistance component to
carry out studies on stock management, integrated distribution works management, train staff on
the engineering, design, and marketing of distribution networks, and implement an electricity
tariffs policy (including computer hardware and software required to implement the
recommendations of the studies and the training). In addition, a set of covenants in the loan and
project agreements established specific actions to be taken by the Government and ONE to adjust
electricity tariffs, reduce arrears, reorganize ONE, and implement the recommendations of the
studies to improve the operational performance of ONE and the power sector. The project was to
increase the electrification index of the rural population in concentrated areas from 25 percent in
1990 to 45 percent at project completion in 1997, and to assist ONE in improving its planning,
accounting, and financial performance (paras. 4-7).
3.    The project's objectives were relevant to Morocco's power sector. They were congruent
with those pursued by the Government and with Bank policies for the power sector prevailing at
that time. The objectives were clearly stated in the Staff Appraisal Report. The project was to
support phase II of the Rural Electrification Program (PNER II). It was defined as a logical
continuation of the Village Electrification Project (Loan 1695-MOR) (paras. 8-9).



Implementation Experience and Results
4.    Physical objectives were partially achieved. The number of new rural communities
connected to electric service by ONE has been very close to the appraisal estimate, but the
number of new customers connected has been substantially less than the goal set by the SAR.
Compare, for example, the 423 new rural centers and 76,500 new rural customers connected by
the project to the appraisal estimate of 462 centers and 170,000 connections, respectively. Even,
if the on-going works are completed in 1999, the number of new rural connections achieved will
be about half of the appraisal estimate. Whereas the project was designed to increase rural
electrification coverage from 25 percent in 1990 to 45 percent by 1997, it only achieved about
28.5 percent, i.e. an improvement of only 3.5 percent (paras. 10-11 and Table 1.1).
5.    The partial physical achievement of the project to date, and the on-going works expected
to be completed by the end of 1999, can be explained by the long delay in loan effectiveness
caused by the non-compliance of the GOM with the agreements established in the project as
originally structured and by the weak implementation arrangements (executing unit). Despite the
financing restructuring of 1992, the project did not progress. The results began to improve only
after the project was restructured in 1994/95 by reducing its scope, making new financing
arrangements, and creating the Directorate of Rural Electrification in ONE in June 1995 (paras.
30-33).
6.    The technical operations of ONE have somewhat improved: electricity production has
increased steadily to 11,703 GWh in 1996 at an average growth of 4.8 percent per year since 1990,
including electricity imports from Algeria and purchase from local suppliers during the drought of
1992-1995, especially in 1993 when the hydroelectric plants delivered only one third of their
average generation and about half the estimate for a dry year. Installed capacity expanded to 3,654
MW in 1997 (average growth of 9.4 percent per year since 1990). Major capacity additions to the
system occurred with the comnmissioning of the Jorf Lasfar thermal power plant in 1995-96 and the
Al Ouaha hydroelectric plant in 1997. The power system networks were also significantly
extended during the period 1990-1996; and the average efficiency of thermal power plants reached
3442 kCal/kWh in 1996 -- a 7.9 percent improvement from their efficiency in 1990, due mainly
to the good efficiency of the Jorf Lasfar coal-fired thermal power plant (paras. 13-16 and Tables
1.2 and 1.3).
7.   Institutional objectives were partially achieved.  The project accomplished some
improvements in the financial and managerial autonomy of (ONE, particularly toward the end of
project implementation. Until 1993 cash generation made it possible for ONE to self-finance less
than 19 percent of its annual investment program (in 1992 it was not able to self-finance any
portion of this program). Since 1994 cash generation has financed 30 percent or more (49
percent in 1997) of ONE's investment program because of less investment, less fuel
consumption, more hydroelectric generation, and more revenues from a boost in sales and tariffs.
Accounts receivable and arrears have become a chronic problem for ONE. Accounts receivable
were very large until 1992 (in the range 9.2-9.5 months) and declined steadily to 4.7 months in
1996, and to an estimated 3.0 months of billing in 1997, yet have remained far from good
practice of 45 to 60 days. The arrears of the Regie of Casablanca (the main culprit) have begun to



iii
diminish following its privatization in August 1997: the concessionaire is paying in a timely
manner both the monthly electricity bills and the arrears (a total of 1,300 million DH) which
were rescheduled over the next 3 years. Since the economic importance for the country mitigates
against disconnecting the railways (ONCF) the water utility (ONEP) from electric service their
arrears were rescheduled in 1996 for ONCF (24 months) and ONEP (36 months) which are now
paying in a timely manner the monthly electricity bills and the rescheduled arrears. A coupon
system (vignettes) launched by the Government in 1992-93 for the payment of utility bills by the
Administration and local governments was insufficient until 1995 but worked well in 1996 and
1997, although 100 million DH of old arrears to ONE have not decreased. Regarding ONE's
debt service coverage, it was adequate until 1992 and below 1.5 in 1993 and 1994, but ONE did
not default on this covenant. From 1995 to 1997 ONE's debt service coverage exceeded 1.5
(paras. 17-23 and Table 1.4).
8.    Electricity tariffs. The level and structure of the tariffs prevailing until 1994 were not
appropriate to recover cost based on economic principles. They were insufficient to meet the self-
financing ratio and debt service coverage in every year. Until 1992, tariffs had yielded an average
revenue of DH 0.72/kWh (about 8.5 UScents per kWh) and had subsidized consumption of up to
500 kWh per month (industrial and commercial consumers bearing the difference), and were
uniform to the end consumer countrywide. A small tariff increase in 1993 yielded an average
revenue of 0.76 DH/kW]h in 1993 and 0.80 DH/kWh in 1994 and 1995 (about 8.7 UScents per
kWh). As a result of pressure exerted by the Bank (including threatening suspension of
disbursements and cancellation of a proposed Power Sector Loan), the tariffs were increased and
restructured effective January 1996. This adjustment eliminated some of the problems: the average
tariff was increased by 6 percent and the block of domestic subsidized consumption was set at 100
kWh per month, which nonetheless is still too high. This increase yielded an average revenue of
0.86 DH/kWh (about 10 UScents per kWh) in 1996 and 1997. As a way to move the tariffs closer
to its economic structure, the tariffs for industry connected at medium voltage were decreased by 6
percent in October 1997. An additional reduction of 14 percent to the industry would be applied
over the next 5 years. It is worth notice that the electricity price in Morocco is high compared to
the electricity prices prevailing in countries of the MENA region (para 24 and Table 1.5).
9.    Financial management. In April 1996, foreign consultants issued a report on assets
insurance. The recommendations on ONE remaining self insured were implemented during
1997 following internal consultation. Local and foreign consultants reviewed the stock control
management and recommended changing over to a more efficient system, particularly in the
procurement of equipment and spare parts for the operational units. The recommendations were
implemented and a satisfactory system of stock control and management is now in place.
External auditing of accounts is done routinely (para. 25).
10.   Draft contract program for 1993-1995. This draft contract had specified the measures to
be taken by the Government and the complementary actions to be taken by ONE to improve the
financial situation of the latter (tariffs, contribution to ONE's investment program and pay off of
arrears, and complementary actions to be carried out by ONE) The draft contract program was
never signed. Regardless, its objectives were partially achieved: in 1994 and 1996, the electricity
tariffs were increased and measures were taken to reduce the arrears (para. 26).



iv
11.   Project cost and financing.  The project is expected to be completed at a cost of
US$118.6 million, or 46.1 percent below the appraisal estimate of US$220.0 million. This can be
explained by less than estimated physical achievements, and lower costs of equipment,
construction works, and custom duties and taxes. The Bank's contribution to project financing
was US$36.5 million, i.e., only 30.8 percent of the actual project financing requirement, much
less than the 51.8 percent estimated at project appraisal. The reason for such a significant
decrease in Bank's participation in project financing was the decrease in project scope decided in
1994, which led to cancellation of 66.2 percent of the Bank loan. It is estimated that ONE
financed US$12.0 million (10.1 percent), local communities (municipalities) US$59.1 million
(49.8 percent) and the Government US$11.0 million (9.3 percent), mainly in custom duties, taxes
and interest during construction (paras. 28-29 and Part II, Tables 8A, 8B and 8C).
12.   The project's economic performance was reevaluated using the method described in the
SAR, i.e., by calculating the internal rate of return of the stream of net benefits resulting from the
physical components implemented. The cost stream comprises the capital costs of the project,
net of taxes and custom duties; the cost of power delivered to the rural electrification networks;
and the distribution, operating and maintenance costs. The benefit stream includes the revenue
from electricity sales and the estimated consumers' surplus for households (which will use
electricity instead of butane, kerosene, candles and batteries) and for small low-voltage and
medium-voltage industrial customers (which will use electricity from the network instead of
producing it with small diesel generating units). The recalculated internal economic rate of return
is 15.3 percent, which compares well with the 17.8 percent estimated in the SAR for the total
project (para. 30 and Part II, Table 9).
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
13.   The main factors affecting the project were the initially inadequate project financing and
institutional arrangements which did not ensure availability of local funds from the GOM. Two
attempts were made to correct the financing and institutional arrangements, the first in 1992 and
the second in 1994/95. Additional factors were the GOM's tepid initial commitment to
implement measures which would have enhanced the sector financial situation and given
autonomy to ONE, and the 1992-1995 drought that affected ONE's operational performance
negatively by reducing its hydroelectric generation (paras. 31-32).
14.   The loan was restructured in 1992 by introducing FEC (Fonds d' Equipement Communal)
as financing intermediary between the rural communities and the Govermnent (including on-
lending part of the Bank loan to FEC).  The loan became effective in February 1993.
Unfortunately, this arrangement led to very slow starting of the project because of the heavy
bureaucracy created by the many on-lending agreements armong ONE, FEC and hundreds of
local small communities. Additionally, the sub-loans became very expensive for the small
communities because the addition of intermediary spreads to the interest of the Bank loan raised
the interest rate on the sub-loans to 13.5 percent. As a result, the project implementation became
stalled until 1994. The issue was resolved and the project gained momentum in 1994/95 when a



v
new country-wide rural electrification program, the PERG, was defined, the scope of the PNER
II reduced, FEC was reorganized (as financial intermediary it was left only in charge of the sub-
loans it had already made to local communities), and ONE created the Directorate of Rural
Electrification to complete the PNER II under the framework of the PERG. The sources of
financing for the PERG are now a surcharge to urban consumers of 0.02 DH/kWh sold by ONE
and flowing directly into ONE's accounts; a transfer of one third of the VAT allocated to the
local communities to an ONE's account in the Treasury; plarning, engineering, procurement and
supervising services provided in kind by ONE; connection charges to rural consumers; the Bank
loan for the PNER II; and soft term credits for the PERG. Cost recovery is achieved by rural
domestic consumers paying a monthly connection charge of 40 DH (about US$4.2) over 7 years
plus the tariff on electricity consumed (paras. 32-34).
15.   The Government was somewhat committed to implementing the physical part of the
project but not so much to implementing the measures needed to improve power sector
performance. A draft contract program between ONE and the Government, intended to improve
the sector's and ONE's performance, was never signed (paras. 26 and 35).
16.   Procurement of goods and services was done in accordance with Bank guidelines, but
bidding and contract awards were delayed because the project restructuring postponed loan
effectiveness by more than 2 years. Also, the institutional and project financing arrangements
finalized only in 1994/95 introduced additional procurement delays. Procurement involved 46
calls for bids for the supply of equipment and construction services and 6 contracts for consultant
services. Several of the contracts awarded in 1996 and 1997 were turn-key type as a way to
expedite project implementation. The contractors have performed satisfactorily in the supply of
goods and construction services (para. 36 and 37, and Part II, Table 5).
17.   Loan disbursement was very slow compared to the appraisal estimate because of the 30
months delay in making the loan effective: disbursement reached a cumulative level of less than
9 percent of the appraisal estimate 4 years after loan approval. A total of 131 withdrawal
applications were submitted to the Bank and US$36.5 million disbursed from the loan, of which
the Government on-lent US$31.05 to FEC and US$5.45 million to ONE. The balance of
US$75.5 million was canceled in 1996/97 upon request of the Government. The special accounts
for ONE and FEC defined in the Loan Agreement were not opened in the Treasury because no
simple procedure was found to reconcile the internal procedures of ONE and FEC with the
demands of the Treasury. At last, ONE and FEC were authorized by the Treasury to commit
payment to suppliers through letters of credit arranged through the Bank (paras. 38 and 39, and
Part J, Table 4).
18.   A training component was included as part of the technical assistance component of the
project but not described in the SAR. Later, neither the Bank nor ONE ever defined a training
program for the staff to be involved in the project. Under bilateral agreements, most of them
grants, donor countries (France, Canada, and Italy) have made available training programs for
Morocco. Thus, the training component included in the project was taken out of the Bank's control
(para. 27).



vi
Bank Performance
19.   Bank performance was mixed in project identification, preparation and appraisal. The
Bank staff identified and prepared the project as a follow-up to the first Village Electrification
Project the project design was similar to the first project except for different project financing
arrangements. On the positive side, the Bank staff devoted important effort to project preparation
which is reflected in a SAR of good quality. The SAR defined sound project objectives, clear
physical scope of the project based on field surveys made by the COSPER with the assistance of
consultants, specific criteria for eligibility of communities to be electrified, and included an
excellent project economic analysis and extensive discussion of the power sector issues. On the
other hand, the Bank failed to assess the full implications of the financing arrangements
envisaged for the project which hinged in the GOM's commitment to making funds available for
project implementation. It suffices to recall that the Village Electrification Project completed in
1988 (100 percent financed by GOM contributions and advance payment of connections by the
consumers) was significantly delayed by the GOM not making available to ONE in full and
timely the funds required by the project implementation. In the loan approved by the Bank in
1991 the GOM and the local communities were expected to finance 50 percent of the project cost
each (including the Bank loan). The local communities were to receive contributions equal to one
third of the VAT to be allocated by the communities to development projects including rural
electrification. The loan was so signed but its effectiveness became protracted because the
financing arrangements contemplated in the appraisal were undermined by, again, the low level
of commitment of the GOM to making funds available for project implementation. Project
identification and preparation can be considered as satisfactory, but appraisal can be
considered as deficient, mainly in account of the unsatisfactory assessment of the GOM's
willingness to comply with the financial plan designed for the project and of the weak
implementation arrangements - executing unit (para. 41).
20.   Bank performance in supervision was also mixed. The Bank carried out extensive
supervision of the project from July 1990 to December 1996, comprising 8 supervision missions
of which 3 missions were carried out between loan approval and effectiveness. Since the project
financing arrangements as appraised did not work, they were revised during project supervision.
In late 1992 the Bank agreed to amend the loan by introducing FEC as financial internediary,
and declared the loan effective in 1993. But that change was not satisfactory either and the
financing and institutional arrangements were changed again in 1994/95, this time successfully.
Also, during that period little pressure was exerted upon the Government and ONE to meet the
sector development objectives. When the project implementation was stalled in 1994, the Bank
threatened to suspend disbursements, kept a close dialogue with the Government to persuade it of
the need to expedite the project implementation, reform the power sector reform, enable private
sector participation in the form of IPPs, and reorganize ONE. Then the project was restructured
successfully, gained momentum, and when the sector began to show progress on tariff setting,
recovery of arrears, reorganization of ONE, and the study on a sector reforrn, the Bank was
flexible and waived noncompliance with important covenants. However, the Bank denied a
request for the extension of the loan closing date because the portfolio was restructured and the
Government requested cancellation of some US$70 million (para. 42-43). Overall, Bank



vii
supervision can be considered as marginally satisfactory, mainly in account of the important
changes it induced in the project and power sector after 1995.
Borrower Performance
21.   Project preparation by the Borrower (the GOM) and ONE as the project executing agency,
was very slow and considered as deficient regarding the initial project financing and institutional
arrangements. It took the Borrower about two years to prepare the project with a structure which
proved to be unfeasible for rural Morocco and protracted loan effectiveness during 30 months. In
fact the GOM had to negotiate an amendment to the original loan agreement to meet the conditions
for loan effectiveness by doing a major change in the financing and institutional arrangements of
the project by including FEC as financing intermediary. However, FEC and ONE were unable to
implement the project at a fast pace due to lack of timely sufficient allocation of funds by the
GOM, heavy bureaucracy to handle a large number of sub-loans and sub-projects among FEC,
ONE and local communities, failure to open the special account to expedite loan disbursement, and
initial weak interest of ONE in the project. The project gained momentum and began to progress
quickly only following its restructuring in 1994/1995. From then until end-1997, about one third
of the original physical objectives were met, which were completed in a satisfactory manner by
ONE's Directorate of Rural Electrification (para. 44).
22.   Regarding the power sector, until 1993 the Government was lax in taking measures to
initiate payments of its arrears to ONE and authorize electricity tariffs adjustments. Only in 1994
and 1996 did the Government initiate actions to pay arrears and approve tariff adjustments allowing
ONE to start complying with the self-financing covenant ONE's situation has also changed
positively since early 1996 as a result of the its reorganization, which has decreased bureaucracy
by decentralizing ONE's functions and devolving management and operational power to the
regions. FEC's initial weak organization had a difficult time in dealing with an overwhelming
number of small loans made to many small local communities. FEC's reorganization in 1994 and
the new financing arrangements dwarfed its role in rural electrification (paras. 45-46).
23.   Considering: (a) the great importance attached by the Bank to the project's financial and
institutional development objectives reflected in loan covenants not fully complied by the GOM;
(b) the innovative financing and institutional arrangement for the PERG made by the GOM based
on the experience gained with two failures of financing and institutional arrangements; (c) the
inclusion of the PNER II as part of the PERG; and (d) the fully satisfactory implementation of the
reduced physical components made by ONE, Borrower performance is considered as deficientfor
compliance with covenants, and as marginally satisfactory for project implementation (para. 47).
Project Sustainability
23.   The prospect for the project to be sustainable is likely because: (a) the reorganization of
ONE is now complete and has begun to show satisfactory results. For example, on the rural
electrification front, ONE's Directorate of Rural Electrification does the planning, contracts for
the physical implementation of the works through turnkey arrangements, and does the
supervision and commissioning of the works. Then, ONE's Distribution Department takes over



viii
the operation and maintenance of the rural networks and customer services; (b) the satisfactory
financial arrangements are working well; (c) the reliance on the private sector for investment in
power generation through IPPs, has decreased public investment in the power sector and started
to show positive results on ONE's finances since 1996; (d) ONE's financial performance
indicators have begun to show positive results as a consequence of actions taken to abate arrears
and reduce investment; and (e) there is a satisfactory plan for future project operation. A new
dynamic in ONEs operations was already sensed by a supervision mission in December 1996 and
confirmed by the ICR mission in December 1997 (para. 48).
Project Outcome
24.   The outcome of the project is somewhat difficult to assess but, overall is considered at
the margin as satisfactory (para. 49). While this is indeed a borderline call, consideration has
been given to the positive achievements which outweigh the less satisfactory results: (a) physical
components of the project, although reduced in scope and delayed, were satisfactorily
implemented; (b) the project prompted the creation of the PERG -- based on the experience had
with the PNER-I and PNER-II-- which is performing well and expected to complete rural
electrification of Morocco in the long run; (c) the project increased the rural electrification
coverage by only 3.5 percent; (d) the recalculated economic rate of return of the physical
components implemented (15.3 percent) is comparable to the appraisal estimate for the whole
project (17.8 percent); (e) ONE's finances were partially improved in terms of some key
indicators of financial performance (internal cash generation, debt coverage ratio, tariff
adjustments), while the arrears due to ONE by the Regies and Offices remain below targets; (f)
the project prompted the studies of ONE's reorganization and power sector reform; (g) the
project sustainability is likely; and (h) the project costs were lower than originally expected.
Future Project Operation
25.   The measures taken by the Government to reorganize ONE, to operate the PNER-II within
the framework of the PERG, to promote private participation, and to improve ONE's reflect a plan
that could contribute tolfuture satisfactory operation of the project. The Government is considering
shaping a power sector reform along the lines of the current Bank paradigm for power sector
development (separating the regulatory and policy-making functions of the Govemment from the
commercial functions of distribution, transmission and power generation to enable efficient private
participation in the sector through fair competition). The commissioning of the IPP in Jorf Lasfar
in 1997 and the proposed IPP at Tahadart are indicative of the opening of the sector to private
operators. ONE's reorganization completed in 1997, decentralized and reallocated activities, and
new directors and managers were appointed. Its steady-state operation is expected during 1998
once all the software supporting the information systems becomes operative. In particular, the
Distribution Departmt and its regional units now have the authority to make operational decisions
without consulting ONE's headquarters. On the pervasive problem of arrears, ONE is abating
arrears by cutting service to delinquent customers, replacing the bi-annual billing system with
quarterly billing to the Administration, and rescheduling payments of arrears with entities providing
essential economic benefits to the country when cutting service is not an option. It is also important
to note that the sector is monitored through a set of performance indicators in line with those



ix
recommended by the Bank, and that additional indicators will be used to monitor and evaluate the
performance of the rural electrification program (paras. 50-55 and Part II, Table 6).
Key Lessons Learned
26.   The following main lessons can be drawn from the project (para. 56):
Lesson 1. A rigorous economic analysis of the benefits of rural electrification can justify
the relative high investment costs of a rural electrification project. In particular, the value of
the consumers' surplus benefit needs to be carefully evaluated because it plays a key role in
the economics of the project. In this case the value of the consumers' surplus benefit is of
the same order of magnitude of benefit proxied by the revenue yielded by the electricity
tariffs.
Lesson 2. Successful implementation of a rural electrification project requires that the
Government be fully committed to clear objectives and stable project financing and
institutional arrangements.  In the Moroccan  project, the Govemment's hesitant
commitment to two financing and institutional setups hampered and delayed project
implementation.
Lesson 3. Establishing an appropriate institutional organization and simple procedures for
project planning, financing, procurement of goods and construction services, and operation
and maintenance is of paramount importance to successfully implement a rural
electrification project involving many small communities. For example, the implementation
of the Moroccan project gained momentum as soon as the Directorate of Rural
Electrification was created, the role of FEC was minimized, and a steady and automatic
flow of funds for project financing was ensured through the transfer to ONE of part of the
VAT allocated to the local communities and the surcharge on the kWh billed to urban
customers and collected by ONE.
Lesson 4. Recovery of the connection cost from rural consumers is possible if spread
monthly over a relative long period of time, at a level appropriate to the means of the rural
population. In the Moroccan project, the willingness to pay and payment capability by rural
consumers led to establishing a monthly connection charge of 40 DH (about US$4.2) over
7 years, plus a charge for electricity consumption billed at the domestic tariff rate.
Lesson 5. Early assessment of the technology and standards available to achieve rural
electrification at low cost should be a prerequisite for planning and designing a rural
electrification program. In the Moroccan project, this was not done because the adoption of
European standards for urban and rural projects (also involving standardized equipment) by
ONE many years ago, made a shift to American standards very difficult. However, based
on a recent study made by ONE with the assistance of consultants, a pilot project is
exploring the feasibility of such a change. The latter, if adopted in appropriate terrain, could
result in significant savings in investment costs.



x
Lesson 6. A contract program between the Government and a Government-owned utility
(ONE in this project) has no effective value because the Government is no legally liable to
meet its conmnitments and it is not a truly commercial contract. Consequently its non-
compliance with the contract program impedes the utility's ability to meet its own
commitments.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
MOROCCO
SECOND RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
(Loan 3262-MOR)
A. Statement and Evaluation of Objectives
Introduction
1.    The degree of electrification in Morocco is low compared to other Middle East and North
African countries. Electricity consumption per capita is now about 467 kWh (it was 343 kWh in
1986), reflecting a low level of rural electrification. Electricity consumption per capita is low
compared to 650 kWh in Algeria, 669 kWh in Tunisia, 755 kWh in Egypt, and 1,016 kWh in
Jordan. It has grown at an average rate of 4.8 percent from 1990 to 1997. Electricity service
covers about 70 percent of the Morocco's population, which is low compared to Algeria and
Tunisia (94 percent), Egypt (95 percent), Iran (96 percent), and Jordan and Lebanon (98 percent).
2.    During the period 1973-1992 the Bank made five loans to Morocco's power subsector
totaling US$320 million. These loans assisted Morocco in developing thermal and hydroelectric
generation, transmission systems, power distribution, and rural electrification. These loans also
attempted to improve the organization of the Moroccan power subsector and its economic,
operational, and financial performance. In particular, Loan 3262-MOR, the subject of this ICR,
followed and overlapped with Loan 2910-MOR (Power Distribution Project). These two loans
had the common objective of improving the institutional side of the power sector.
Project Objectives and Components
3.    The main objectives of the project were to: (a) expand electricity supply to the rural areas;
(b) improve the reliability and quality of service of the existing rural distribution network; (c)
strengthen the administrative, planning and financial capabilities in the power subsector; (d)
implement institutional reforms aimed at delineating and streamlining the responsibility for
planning, implementing, operating and managing the rural distribution system; and (e) encourage
further reforms in the electricity tariff structure. Also, the project was expected to contribute to
the Government's policy of improving the efficiency of energy consumption.
4.    To achieve the physical objectives, the project included components to connect to the
main grid about 170,000 consumers in about 462 villages located in 34 provinces. To achieve
the institutional objectives, the project included a technical assistance component to carry out
studies on electricity tariffs, stock management, integrated distribution works management, and
staff training on the engineering, design, and marketing of distribution networks (including
computer hardware and software required to implement the recommendations of the studies and
the training). Additionally, a set of covenants in the loan and project agreements established
specific actions to be taken by the Government and ONE to adjust electricity tariffs, reduce



2
arrears, reorganize ONE, and implement the recommendations of the studies intended to improve
the operational performance of ONE and the power sector.
5.    The physical components included:
(a) construction of about 5,850 km of medium-voltage (MV) and low-voltage (LV) lines,
and distribution transformers with a total installed capacity of about 70 MVA;
(b) construction of about 170,000 consumer connections;
(c) construction of about 10,000 square meters of floor space in the regional offices; and
(d) supply of vehicles and specialized equipment for operating and maintaining the
distribution network in the newly electrified villages.
6.    The technical assistance component included: (a) consultant services for carrying out
studies on stock management, integrated distribution works management, and implementing a
national tariff policy; and (b) training of ONE's staff in distribution network engineering design
and marketing, and the supply of computer hardware and software for implementing the
recommendations of the studies and the training. Later, this component also supported studies
on ONE reorganization.
7.    The project was expected to increase the electrification index of the rural population in
concentrated areas from 25 percent in 1990 to 45 percent' at project completion in 1997, and to
assist ONE in improving its planning, accounting, and financial performance.
8.    The project's objectives were relevant to the power subsector of Morocco. They were
congruent with those pursued by the Government and with Bank policies for the power subsector
prevailing at that time.2 The objectives were clearly stated in the Staff Appraisal Report. The
project was to support phase II of the Rural Electrification Program (PNER II). It was defined as
a logical continuation of the Village Electrification Project (Loan 1695-MOR) which, at loan
closing in 1986, had not completed all the consumer connections planned in the project, but had
completed the procurement of the material and equipment necessary to connect about 60,000
new rural consumers.3
9.    With the benefit of hindsight it can be stated that the project components were
appropriate to achieve the physical objective of extending electricity service to the rural
SAR, para. 3.03, page 18.
2  In 1988, the Bank's policy for the electric power subsector was detailed in OMS 3.72.

B. Achievement of Objectives
Implementation Organization
10.   Physical components are being implemented by ONE. Project execution was assigned to
ONE, where a Directorate of Rural Electrification created in June 1995 is now carrying out the
implementation of the physical components in a satisfactory manner. In ONE, project
coordination and financial matters are being handled by its Finance Department. FEC, as a
financial intermediary, intervened in the on-lending of Bank funds to the local communities,
which in turn contracted with ONE to build the distribution networks. FEC's performance,
however was not satisfactory. FEC's weak organization had a difficult time in making a very
large number of sub-loans to the small communities, but its reorganization in 1994 relieved its
administrative burden by leaving it in charge of only 341 sub-loans already made. However, FEC
still has not been able to set up records to monitor the progress of the sub-loans. ONE's skilled
staff performed satisfactorily in implementing the physical components of the project.
Physical Objectives
11.   Physical objectives were partially achieved.  Whereas the project was designed to
increase rural electrification coverage from 25 percent in 1990 to 45 percent by 1997, it only
achieved about 28.5 percent coverage, or an improvement of only 3.5 percent. The number of
new rural communities connected to electric service by ONE has been very close to the appraisal
estimate. On the other hand, the number of new consumers has been substantially less than the
goal set by the SAR. Compare, for example, the 423 new rural communities and 76,500 new
rural customers connected by the project to the appraisal estimate of 462 communities and
170,000 connections.  In 1992, the rural electrification program  comprised seven parts
(tranches), designated D, E, F, G, H, I, and J. Parts D and E including 284 villages were not part
of the Bank project, but were implemented with financing from the European Investment Bank
(EIB). The Bank project included parts F and G which in turn were split in parts FlA (31
villages, 100 percent of connections completed), FG (250 villages, 53 percent of connections
completed), and CFG (complement of FG 144 villages, 31 percent of connections completed).
Parts H, I and J were removed from the project in 1994 and are being implemented by the newly
defined PERG. Even, if the on-going works were completed in 1999, the number of new rural
connections achieved would be only about half of the appraisal estimate. The low achievement
of the original physical objectives is also illustrated by the completion of only 1,993 km of 22-
4  Conditions were a follow-up of those contained in the Power Distribution Project financed by Loan 2910-
MOR.

kV lines (SAR goal: 3,264 kmn), 1,987 km of low-voltage lines (SAR goal: 2,580 km), and 53
MVA in power distribution transformers (SAR goal: 720 MVA) (Table 1.1).

12.   The partial physical achievement of the project to date, and the on-going works expected
to be completed by the end of 1999, can be explained by the long delay in loan effectiveness
caused by the non-compliance of the GOM with the agreements established in the project as
originally structured and by the weak implementation arrangements (executing unit). Despite the
financing restructuring of 1992, the project did not progressed. The results began to improve
only after the project was restructured in 1994/95 by reducing its scope, making new financing
arrangements, and creating the Directorate of Rural Electrification in ONE in June 1995 (paras.
30-33).
13.   ONE's technical operations. In spite of past financial problems, the technical operations
of ONE have somewhat improved. Electricity production increased steadily from 8,815 GWh in
1990 to 11,703 GWh in 1996 (average growth of 4.8 percent per year), including electricity imports
from Algeria and purchase from local suppliers. The imports and local purchases of electricity
amounted to about 11 percent of total electricity output during the drought experienced in 1992-
1995, especially in 1993 when the hydroelectric plants delivered only one third of their average
generation and about half the estimate for a dry year (Tables 1.2 and 1.3). Hydroelectric generation
is not fully reliable because, in addition to the limitations posed by the stochastic nature of the
hydrology, ONE must give priority to irrigation needs in releasing available water from its
multipurpose plants.

(*) Estimated guaranteed hydroelectric generation (dry year).
14.   Physical expansion of the power system. ONE's installed capacity grew from 1,952 MW in
1990 to 3,654 MW in 1997 (average growth of 9.4 percent per year), of which 3,260 MW is
effective because a substantial part of the increase was in gas turbines. Major capacity additions to
the system occurred in 1995-1996 with the commissioning of the Jorf Lasfar thermal power plant
and the Al Ouaha hydroelectric plant in 1997. Also, the transmission and distribution systems were
significantly extended during the period 1990-1996, with the addition of 1,408 km of 220-kV lines;
1,375 km of 60-kV lines; 6,362 km of distribution lines; 2,091 MVA in 220-kV power transformers
and 1,290 MVA in 60-kV power transformers; and numerous high- and medium-voltage
substations.
15.   Energy losses. ONE is making an effort to keep distribution losses in the range of 6-7
percent, which is considered the economic level for large distribution systems. ONE will benefit
from implementation of the recommendations made by the EdF/ESMAP loss reduction study (a
one percent reduction in energy losses could save ONE about DH 32 million/year). ONE's losses
in power plants (due mainly to consumption by auxiliary services) and its high voltage transmission
system are in line with utility experience elsewhere and do not pose a particular problem.

16.   Efficiency of thermal plants. Oil and coal steam plants decreased fuel consumption to
about 2,334 kCal/kWh in 1996 from 2,501 kCal/kWh in 1990, a 6.7 percent improvement. This
improvement was due mainly to the commissioning of the Jorf Lasfar coal-fired thermal power
plant, which has a lower specific coal consumption. Also, gas turbines decreased their fuel
consumption to about 3,086 kCal/kWh in 1996 from 3,947 kCal/kWh in 1990, a 22 percent
improvement, because of the installation of more efficient gas turbines. Similarly, diesel plant
efficiency improved to about 2,130 kCal/kWh in 1996 from 2,597 kCal/kWh in 1990, a 18
percent improvement. For all plants combined, the average fuel consumption improved to 2,344
kCal/kWh in 1996 from the 2,545 kCal/kWh in 1990, a 79 percent improvement.
Institutional Objectives
17.  Institutional objectives were partially achieved. The project accomplished some
improvements in the financial performance of ONE and in its managerial autonomy. The actions
taken as a result of tariff studies and ONE's reorganization financed by the project, and the
pressure to comply with loan covenants, contributed to improving the financial and operational
performance of ONE toward the end of the project.
18.   Overall ONE's financial performance has been mixed. (Part II, Table 8C: Financial
Statements). It was not satisfactory until 1994/1995 because: (a) ONE's high investments
program and debt service were not matched with the internal cash generation forecast at the
project appraisal (expected in the range 28 to 49 percent of the investment program) and
Government contributions did not materialize as needed; (b) poor collection made actual
accounts receivable exceed by more than 40 to 68 percent the appraisal estimates; (c) electricity
tariffs level and structure were not set in accordance with economic principles, nor were they
adjusted in a timely manner when changes occurred in fuel oil and coal prices; and (d) the
attempts to improve ONE's financial performance through contract programs with the
Government failed and were abandoned in 1994.  Only in recent years have ONE's self
financing and debt service coverage indicators improved and reached the covenanted targets.
However, the accounts receivable and arrears to ONE remained very high and never met the
covenanted targets, but began to decrease significantly in 1996 and 1997.
19.   ONE's self-financing and debt service coverage. Until 1993 cash generation enabled
ONE to finance less than 19 percent of its annual investment program (in 1992 it did not finance
any). Only in 1994 did cash generation begin to finance 30 percent or more of ONE's investment
program because of less investment, less fuel consumption (and more hydroelectric generation)
once the drought was over, and more revenues from a boost in sales and tariffs. Self-financing
reached 30 percent in 1995, and 33 percent in 1996. Until 1992 debt service coverage was
adequate. Although in 1993 and 1994 the debt service coverage ratio was below 1.5, ONE did
not default on this covenant. In 1995 and 1996 ONE's debt service coverage again reached an
acceptable level (Table 1.4).
20.   Accounts receivable. Accounts receivable and arrears have become a chronic problem for
ONE. They were very large until 1992 (in the range 9.2-9.5 months) and declined steadily to 4.7
months in 1996, and it is expected that in 1997 it will reach 3.0 months, yet are still far above the



7
two months required by the Bank. The main delinquent customers have been the Regies, the
Offices and the local governments and the Administration (Table 1. 4).
21.   The large arrears of the Regies are explained by (a) the insufficient margins between the
retail tariffs and bulk tariffs of ONE to the Regies; and (b) the poor payment records to the
Regies by the Administration and local governments. However, the arrears of Casablanca (the
main culprit) have begun to diminish following its privatization in August 1997: the
concessionaire is paying in a timely manner both the monthly electricity bills and the arrears (a
total of 1,300 million DH), which were rescheduled over the next 3 years.
22.   The Offices, mainly the railways (ONCF), the water utility (ONEP), and the phosphate
concerns (OCP) have built up significant arrears to ONE because their economic importance for
the country mitigates against disconnecting them from electric service. Payment of these arrears
were rescheduled in 1996 for ONCF (24 months) and ONEP (36 months), which are now paying
the monthly bills and the rescheduled arrears in a timely manner. The Administration and local
governments have also had a poor payment record because of the insufficient budget allocated to
pay utility services.
23.   Although ONE has devoted considerable effort to reducing arrears to an acceptable level,
past measures have only been of a temporary nature. Some of the measures taken to improve
collection rates have been: (a) cutting service to delinquent customers; (b) replacing quarterly
billing for bi-annual billing to the Administration; and (c) rescheduling of arrears of small,
insolvent communities and of some Offices (ONCF and ONEP). Also, the coupon system
(vignettes) launched by the Government in 1992-93 for the payment of utility bills by the
Administration and local governments was insufficient to cover payment for electricity service
until 1995. It began to be effective in 1996, and by 1997 the system was working well, though
100 million D]H of old arrears have remained constant.

24.   Electricity tariffs. The level and structure of the tariffs prevailing until 1994 were not
appropriate to recover costs based on economic principles. As indicated above (para. 19), they were



8
insufficient to meet the self-financing ratio and debt service coverage in every year. Until 1992,
tariffs had yielded an average revenue of DH 0.72/kWh (about 8.5 UScents per kWh), had
subsidized consumption of up to 500 kWh per month (industrial and commercial consumers
bearing the difference), and were uniform to the end consumer countrywide. An small increase was
made in 1993 which yielded an average revenue of 0.76 DH/kWh in 1993 and 0.80 DH/kWh in
1994 and 1995 (about 8.7 UScents per kWh). As a result of the pressure exerted by the Bank
(including threatening suspension of disbursements and cancellation of a proposed Power Sector
Loan), tariffs were increased effective January 1996. This adjustment to the level and structure of
tariffs eliminated some of the problems: the average tariff was increased by 6 percent and the block
of domestic subsidized consumption was set at 100 kWh per month, which nonetheless is still high
(Table 1.5). This increase yielded an average revenue of 0.86 DH/kWh (about 10 UScents per
kWh) in 1996 and 1997. It is worth noting that in terms of current DH, the average revenue has
increased by 21 percent since 1990, but in terms of constant 1990 DH, it has decreased by 8.5
percent. As a way to move the tariffs closer to their economic structure, the tariffs for industry
connected at medium voltage were decreased by 6 percent in October 1997. An additional
reduction of 14 percent to the industry would be applied over the next 5 years. Electricity price in
Morocco is high compared to the electricity price prevailing in countries of the MENA region:
Algeria (4.3 UScents/kWh), Egypt (4.3 UScents/kWh), Tunisia (6.4 UScents/kWh), Lebanon (7.0
UScents/kWh), however Morocco's tariffs reflect a very high taxation rate on fuels used for power
generation.

25.   Financial management. In April 1996, foreign consultants issued a report on assets
insurance. The recommendation of ONE remaining self-insured were implemented during 1997
following internal consultation. Local and foreign consultants also reviewed the stock control
management and recommended changing over to a more efficient system, particularly in the
procurement of equipment and spare parts for operational units. The recommendations were
implemented and now a satisfactory system of stock control and management is in place.
External auditing of accounts is done routinely, though with some delays.
26.   Draft contract program for 1993-1995. A contract program between ONE and the
Government for 1989-19915 had specified the measures to be taken by the Government and the
complementary actions by ONE to improve the financial situation of the latter. This contract did
not achieve its objectives. Since the Government did not meet its commitments, ONE could not
meet its own. ONE's financial situation was reviewed in 1992. This led to a draft contract
program for 1993-1995 setting up measures to be taken by the Government on tariffs,
contribution to ONE's investment program and pay off of arrears, and complementary actions to
be carried out by ONE. The revised draft contract program was never signed, but regardless, its
objectives were partially achieved: in 1994 and 1996, the electricity tariffs were increased (para.
24) and measures were taken to reduce the arrears (paras. 22-23).
Training
27.   A training component was included as part of the technical assistance component of the
project but was not described in the SAR. During implementation, neither the Bank nor ONE ever
defined a training program for staff involved in the project. ONE chose other means of carrying out
and financing its staff training. Under bilateral agreements at better financial terms than offered by
the Bank, most of them non-reimbursable, donor countries (France, Canada, and Italy) have made
available training programs for Morocco and, consequently, the training component included in the
project was taken out of control of the Bank. Funds allocated in the loan for staff training were not
utilized.
Project Costs
28.   The project is expected to be completed at a cost of US$118.6 million, or 46.1 percent
below the appraisal estimate of US$220.0 million. That can be explained by the significant
reduction of the physical components implemented, and by the lower cost of installation and
construction works, custom duties and taxes (Part II, Table 8A: Project Cost).
Project Financing.
29.   The Bank's contribution to project financing was only US$36.5 million, i.e., 30.8 percent
of the estimated actual project financing requirements and certainly much less than the 51.8
percent estimated at project appraisal. The reason for such a significant decrease was the
s  The contract program was established under Loan 291 0-MOR.



10
reduction in the physical components implemented that led to cancellation of 66.2 percent of the
Bank loan (para. 37). It is estimated that ONE financed US$12.0 million (10.1 percent), local
communities (municipalities) US$59.1 million (49.8 percent) and the Government US$11.0
million (9.3 percent, mainly custom duties and taxes and interest during construction) (Part II,
Table 8B: Project Financing).
Project Economic Performance
30.   The project's economic performance was reevaluated using the method described in the
SAR, i.e., by calculating the internal rate of return of the stream of net benefits associated with
the physical components implemented. The cost stream comprises: (a) the capital costs of the
project net of taxes and custom duties; (b) the cost of power delivered to the rural electrification
networks, derived from an estimate of the long-run marginal of power plus losses in the
distribution network; and (c) the operating and maintenance cost of the distribution system. The
benefit stream is composed of: (a) revenue from electricity sales at the prevailing tariff rates; and
(b) estimated consumers' surplus for households that replace butane, kerosene, candles and
batteries with electricity, and for small low-voltage and medium-voltage industrial customers
that otherwise would use electricity produced by small diesel generating units. All costs and
benefits were expressed in 1990 prices using deflator indices to account for local inflation and
rate of exchange variations. The recalculated internal economic rate of return is 15.3 percent,
which compares well with the 17.8 percent estimated in the SAR for the total project (Part II,
Table 9: Economic Costs and Benefits).
C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
31.   The main factors affecting the project were the initially inadequate project financing and
institutional arrangements which did not ensure availability of local funds from the GOM. Two
attempts were made to correct the financing and institutional arrangements, the first in 1992 and
the second in 1994/95, as explained below. Additional factors were the GOM's tepid initial
commitment to implement measures which would have enhanced the sector financial situation
and given autonomy to ONE, and an uncontrollable natural event (the 1992-1995 drought that
reduced hydroelectric generation) which affected ONE's operational performance during project
implementation.
32.   Originally, the PNER II was to be financed by: (a) the transfer of the Bank loan from the
GOM to ONE in two parts: (i) an equity contribution of US$96.5 million to finance the foreign
exchange cost of distribution lines, substations and transformers; and (ii) a loan of US$ 17.5
million to finance the foreign component cost of the connections to rural consumers; and (b)
funds equivalent to about one third of the VAT transferred by the GOM to the local communities
(municipalities) to finance the local cost of the project. Originally, the physical implementation
of the project was assigned to ONE as an entity but without identifying a project unit in it. The
GOM did not implement these financial arrangements and, consequently, the loan effectiveness
was delayed until the financing arrangements and institutional setup were restructured in
December 1992. The project restructuring introduced FEC as financing intermediary between
the GOM and the rural communities, and ONE as implementing agency of the communities' sub-



11
projects financed by FEC's sub-loans. Under this arrangement the project was to be financed by:
(a) US$ 94.9 million of the Bank loan on-lent to FEC by the GOM at an annual interest rate of 12
percent; (b) US$ 19.1 million of the Bank loan on-lent to ONE under the same terms of the Bank
loan, to finance the foreign component cost of the connections to rural consumers; and (c) funds
equivalent to about one third of the VAT transferred by the GOM to the local communities
(municipalities) to finance the local cost of the project. In turn, FEC was to provide sub-loans to
the local communities at a rate of 13.5 percent to finance the foreign component of the rural
electrification sub-projects. The local communities had to contract with ONE the physical
implementation of the rural sub-projects. The restructured loan became effective in February
1993. Unfortunately, this arrangement led to very slow project starting because of the heavy
bureaucracy created by the many on-lending agreements among the Government, FEC, ONE and
hundreds of local small communities. Additionally, the FEC sub-loans at an annual interest rate
of 13.5 percent became very expensive for the small communities. As a result, the project
implementation was stalled until 1994. The issue was resolved in 1994/95, and the PNER II
gained momentum, when a new country-wide rural electrification program (the PERG) was
defined, the scope of the PNER II reduced, new financing and institutional arrangements were
put in place to expedite the flow of funds to ONE as executing agency and FEC's role was
minimized.
33.   Financing of the PNER-II is now done under the modality applied in the PERG: (a) a
surcharge of 0.02 DH/kWh on electricity sold by ONE finances about 35 percent of the rural
electrification cost (this money flows directly into ONE's treasury); (b) one third of the VAT
allocated to the local communities finances about 20 percent of the cost (this money flows into
an ONE's account in the Treasury); (c) a monthly connection charge of 40 DH (about US$4.2)
paid to ONE by the rural customer during 7 years which finances about 25 percent of the cost;
and (d) the balance of 20 percent of the cost is contributed in kind by ONE's provision of
planning, engineering, procurement and supervision services. Moreover, ONE has access to soft
credits available from foreign lenders and it has now secured a credit from OECF (Japan) to
finance the rural electrification program for an amount equivalent to the part of the Bank's loan
which was canceled.
34.   The institutional arrangements for the PNER II are now clearly defined: (a) the
Directorate of Rural Electrification created in ONE is the sole responsible for implementing the
physical components of the PERG and completing the PNER II; (b) the ONE's Distribution
Department is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the PERG's facilities after
completion by the Directorate of Rural Electrification; (c) the FEC does not play any role in the
PERG other than to administer the sub-loans it had already made to local communities under the
PNER-II.
35.   The Government was somewhat committed to implementing the physical part of the
project but initially tepid in implementing the measures needed to improve performance in the
power subsector, e.g., it did not provide financial and management autonomy to ONE, nor did it
allow the cost of service to be recovered through appropriate level and structure of tariffs, nor did
it pay off its arrears, nor did it simplify bureaucratic procedures -- in particular those which also
affected the procurement of goods and services and disbursement of funds for the PNER II.



12
36.   Procurement of goods and services was significantly delayed because loan effectiveness
took 30 months, and the project financing arrangements and institutional setup which were
finalized only in 1995. Procurement of equipment (awarding of contracts) was completed in
October 1996, and the awarding of construction contracts was completed in July 1997, involving
46 calls for bids for the supply of equipment and construction services. (Part 11, Table 5:
Indicators for Project Implementation). Several of the contracts awarded in 1996 and 1997 were
of the turn-key type (supply of equipment and construction services by a single contractor) as a
way to expedite the implementation of project components. Irn addition, the studies contemplated
in the project were carried out through 6 contracts for consultant services. Procurement was
done in accordance with Bank guidelines.
37.   The performance of contractors has been satisfactory, the supply of goods and services
has been of good quality, and ONE's technical staff has performed satisfactorily in supervising
the quality of the equipment and materials and the construction works.
38.   Loan disbursement was very slow compared to the appraisal estimate (Part II, Table 4.
Loan Disbursement). Disbursements began with a delay of more than 3 years and reached a
cumulative level of less than 9 percent of the appraisal estimate 4 years after loan approval. This
was caused by the 30 month delay in making the loan effective. A total of 131 withdrawal
applications were submitted to the Bank by the Governrment. Out of the US$36.5 million
disbursed from the loan, the GOM on-lent US$31.05 to FEC and US$5.45 million to ONE, and
in 1996/97 requested to cancel the balance of US$75.4 million.
39.   To facilitate loan disbursements and payments to suppliers, the Bank and the Government
had agreed that special accounts for ONE and FEC were to be opened in the Treasury.
However, the special account were never opened because no simple procedure was found to
reconcile the internal procedures of ONE and FEC with the demands of the Treasury. ONE and
FEC were ultimately authorized by the Treasury to commit payment to suppliers through letters
of credit arranged through the Bank.
40.   The dry hydrology during the period 1992-1995 forced ONE to decrease low cost
hydroelectric generation, install gas turbines burning expensive liquid fuel, generate more from
thermal plants, and purchase more power from Algeria (at 4.0 UScents/kWh) and local suppliers.
Consequently, ONE's operational costs increased significantly during those dry years.
D. Bank Performance
41.   Bank performance was mixed in project identification, preparation and appraisal. The
Bank staff identified and prepared the project as a follow-up to the first Village Electrification
Project (technically that project was successfully completed6); the project design was similar to
6  Page (v) of PCR on Morocco Village Electrification Project (Loan 1695-MOR), Bank Report No. 7325, June
1988.



13
the first project except for different project financing arrangements (para. 32). On the positive
side, the Bank staff devoted important effort to project preparation which is reflected in a SAR of
good quality. The SAR defined sound project objectives, clear physical scope of the project
based on field surveys made by the COSPER (Comite de Suivi du Programme d' Electrification
Rurale) with the assistant of consultants, specific criteria for eligibility of communities to be
electrified, and included an excellent project economic analysis and extensive discussion of the
power sector issues. On the other hand, the Bank failed to assess the full implications of the
financing arrangements envisaged for the project which hinged in the GOM's commitment to
making funds available for project implementation. It suffices to recall that the Village
Electrification Project completed in 1988 (100 percent financed by GOM contributions and
advance payment of connections by the consumers) was significantly delayed by the GOM not
making available to ONE in full and timely the funds required by the project implementation. In
the loan approved by the Bank in 1991 the GOM and the local communities were expected to
finance 50 percent of the project cost each (including the Bank loan). The local communities
were to receive contributions equal to one third of the VAT to be allocated by the communities to
development projects including rural electrification. The loan was so signed but its effectiveness
became protracted because the financing arrangements contemplated in the appraisal were-
undermined by, again, the low level of commitment of the GOM to making funds available for
project implementation.  Project identification and preparation can be considered as
satisfactory, but appraisal can be considered as deficient, mainly in account of the unsatisfactory
assessment of the GOM's willingness to comply with the financial plan designed for the project
and of the weak implementation arrangements (executing unit).
42.   Bank performance in supervision was also mixed. The Bank carried out extensive
supervision of the project from July 1990 to December 1996, comprising 8 supervision missions
(6.4 staff-weeks costing US$237,000) of which 3 missions were carried out between loan
approval and effectiveness. (Part II, Table 12. Bank Resources: Staff Inputs; Table 13: Bank
Resources: Missions). Since the project financing arrangements as appraised did not work, they
were revised during project supervision. In late 1992 the Bank agreed to amend the loan by
introducing FEC as financial intermediary, and declared the loan effective in 1993. But that
change was not satisfactory either and the financing and institutional arrangements were changed
again in 1994/95, this time successfully (paras. 31-34). Also, during that period little pressure
was exerted upon the Government and ONE to meet the sector development objectives. Thus,
Bank supervision can be considered as less than satisfactory until early 1994.
43.   Bank supervision improved since 1994. When the implementation of the PNER II was
stalled in 1994, the Bank threatened to suspend disbursements and supported a second, this time
successful, restructuring of its financing and institutional arrangements. The Bank gave good
advice, not always heeded by the Government, about the importance of expediting
implementation of the PNER II, increasing electricity tariffs, eliminating subsidies at a fast pace,
reducing arrears, and giving full autonomy to ONE as a way to improve its financial and
operational performance. The Bank expanded the close dialogue with the Government and ONE
to attack the roots of the problems affecting the Moroccan power subsector and succeeded in
persuading the Government and ONE to initiate a sector reform along the new paradigm fostered
by the Bank. For this purpose, the Bank financed consultants to carry out studies on the



14
reorganization of ONE, on a new Electricity Law, and also financed advisors for the negotiations
with Independent Power Producers (IPP), the latter two withi funds from Loan 291 0-MOR. The
PNER II gained momentum and, as result of further pressures exerted in later stages of project
implementation, the power sector began to improve. Hence, the Bank was flexible and waived
non-compliance with important covenants when progress was made in project implementation,
tariff setting, recovery of arrears, and the reorganization of ONE. However, the Bank denied a
request for extension of the loan closing date because the Bank's portfolio was restructured and
the Government requested cancellation of some US$70 million. Overall, Bank supervision can
be considered as marginally satisfactory, mainly in account of the important changes it induced
in the project and sector towards the end of the project.
E. Borrower Performance
44.   Project preparation by the Borrower (the GOM) and ONE as the project executing agency,
was very slow and considered as deficient concerning the initial project financing and institutional
arrangements. It took the Borrower about two years to prepare the project with a structure which
proved to be unfeasible for rural Morocco and protracted loan effectiveness during 30 months. In
fact the GOM had to negotiate an amendment to the original loan agreement to meet the conditions
for loan effectiveness by doing a major change in the financing and institutional arrangements of
the project by including FEC as financing intermediary (para.32). However, FEC and ONE were
unable to implement the project at a fast pace due to lack of timely sufficient allocation of funds by
the GOM, heavy bureaucracy to handle a large number of sub-loans and sub-projects among FEC,
ONE and local communities, failure to open the special account to expedite loan disbursement, and
initial weak interest of ONE in the project. Until 1994, procurement of goods and services was
very slow (four years' delay), loan disbursement was dismal and little progress was achieved in
implementing physical components. The project gained momentum and began to progress quickly
only following its restructuring in 1994/1995 (para. 33). From then until end-1997, about one
third of the original physical objectives were met, which were completed in a satisfactory manner
by ONE's Directorate of Rural Electrification (Table 1.1 and Part II, Table 6: Key indicators of
Project Implementation).
45.  Initially, the Government had a low level of commitment to the institutional development
objectives of the project but reacted positively late in project implementation (Part II, Table 10:
Status of Covenants). Until 1993 the Government was lax in taking measures to initiate payments
of its arrears to ONE and to authorize electricity tariffs adjustments. Only in 1994 and 1996 did the
Government initiate actions to abate arrears and approve tariff adjustments allowing ONE to start
complying with the self-financing covenant. But until then the Government had not devolved full
power to. ONE to enable it to become autonomous in managing its operations and finances. This
situation has changed positively since early 1996 as a result of the reorganization of ONE which
has decreased bureaucracy by decentralizing ONE's functions and devolving management and
operational power to the regions. As a by-product of ONE's reorganization, the PNER II benefited
with the creation of the Directorate of Rural Electrification.
46.   FEC, as a financing intermediary has had a difficult time in dealing with an overwhelming
number of small sub-loans made to many small local communities. FEC's reorganization in 1994



15
and the new financial arrangements for rural electrification dwarfed its role in the PERG. But, FEC
still has not been able to set up records to monitor the progress of the sub-loans. It is to be also
noted that FEC was instrumental in supporting cancellation of US$62 million from the Bank to
avoid the payment of commitment fees on Bank money not to be utilized by FEC.
47.   Considering: (a) the great importance attached by the Bank to the project's financial and
institutional development objectives reflected in loan covenants (not fully complied by the GOM);
(b) the innovative financing and institutional arrangement for the PERG made by the GOM based
on the experience gained with two failures of financing and institutional arrangements; (c) the
inclusion of the PNER II as part of the PERG; and (d) the fully satisfactory implementation of the
reduced physical components made by ONE, Borrower performance is considered as deficient for
compliance with covenants, and as marginally satisfactory for project implementation.
F. Assessment of Project Outcome and Sustainability
Project Sustainability
48.   Sustainability of the project is likely because: (a) the reorganization of ONE is now
completed and has begun to show satisfactory results. For example, on the rural electrification
front, ONE's Directorate of Rural Electrification does the planning, contracts for the physical
implementation of the works (now through turn key arrangements), and supervises the
contractor's execution and commissioning of the works. Then ONE's Distribution Department
takes over the operation and maintenance of the rural networks and customer services; (b) the
new financing arrangements for the PERG are providing a steady and automatic flow of money
to ONE for rural electrification; (c) reliance on the private sector for investment in power
generation through IPPs has decreased public investment in the power sector and since 1996 has
started to show a positive effect on ONE's finances; (d) ONE's financial performance indicators
have begun to show positive results as a consequence of actions taken to abate arrears and reduce
investment; and (e) there is a satisfactory plan for future project operation (paras. 50-55) A new
dynamic in ONE's operations was already sensed by a supervision mission in December 1996 and
confirmed by the ICR mission in December 1997.
Project Outcome
49.   The outcome of the project is somewhat difficult to assess but, overall is considered at
the margin as satisfactory (para. 49). While this is indeed a borderline call, consideration has
been given to the positive achievements which outweigh the less satisfactory results: (a) physical
components of the project, although reduced in scope and delayed, were satisfactorily
implemented; (b) the project prompted the creation of the PERG -- based on the experience had
with the PNER-I and PNER-II-- which is performing well and expected to complete rural
electrification of Morocco in the long run; (c) the project increased the rural electrification
coverage by only 3.5 percent; (d) the recalculated economic rate of return of the physical
components implemented (15.3 percent) is comparable to the appraisal estimate for the whole
project (17.8 percent); (e) ONE's finances were partially improved in terms of some key
indicators of financial performance (internal cash generation, debt coverage ratio, tariff



16
adjustments), while the arrears due to ONE by the Regies and Offices remain below targets; (f)
the project prompted the studies of ONE's reorganization and power sector reform; (g) the
project sustainability is likely; and (h) the project costs were lower than originally expected.
G. Future Project Operation
50.   The measures taken by the Government to reorganize ONE, to operate the PNER-II within
the framework of the PERG, promote private participation, and to improve ONE's finances could
contribute to satisfactory operation of the project in the future.
51.   On sector reform, the Government has been cautious, but is considering shaping a power
sector reform along the lines of the current Bank paradigm for power sector development
(unbundling of the commercial functions of distribution, transmission and generation of power
from the regulatory and policy making functions of the state, and enabling efficient private
participation in the sector).
52.   The commissioning of the IPP in Jorf Lasfar in 1997 and the proposed IPP at Tahadart are
indicative of the opening of the sector to private operators. These operations will send a clear
message on the market's willingness to pay for power generation and, consequently, will serve as
reference points for adjusting electricity prices accordingly.
53.   ONE's reorganization was initiated in 1995 and completed in 1997.  It entailed
decentralization and re-allocation of activities and appointment of new directors and managers.
ONE is expected to reach steady-state operation during 1998 once all the software supporting the
information systems becomes operative. For example, the Distribution Department and its regional
units now have the authority to make operational decisions without consulting ONE's headquarters.
54.   On the pervasive problem of arrears, ONE has initiated aggressive measures to abate arrears
by cutting service to delinquent customers, replacing the bi-annual quarterly billing of the
Administration with a quarterly billing system, and rescheduling payment of arrears with entities
providing essential economic benefits to the country, when cutting service is not an option.
55.   It is also important to note that ONE is already monitoring the sector through a set of
performance indicators in line with those recommended by the Bank, and that additional indicators
will be used to monitor and evaluate the performance of the rural electrification program (Part 11,
Table 6: Key Indicators for Project Operation).
H. Key Lessons Learned
56.   Based on the experience gained with this lending operation, the following lessons can be
offered in relation to rural electrification projects:
Lesson 1. A rigorous economic analysis of the benefits of rural electrification can justify
the relative high investment costs of a rural electrification project. In particular, the value of
the consumers' surplus benefit needs to be carefully evaluated because it plays a key role in



17
the economics of the project. In this case the value of the consumers' surplus benefit is of
the same order of magnitude of benefit proxied by the revenue yielded by the electricity
tariffs.
Lesson 2. Successful implementation of a rural electrification project requires that the
Government be fully committed to clear objectives and stable project financing and
institutional arrangements.  In the Moroccan   project, the Government's hesitant
commnitment to two financing and institutional setups hampered and delayed project
implementation.
Lesson 3. Establishing an appropriate institutional organization and simple procedures for
project planning, financing, procurement of goods and construction services, and operation
and maintenance is of paramount importance to successfully implement a rural
electrification project involving many small communities. For example, the implementation
of the Moroccan project gained momentum as soon as the Directorate of Rural
Electrification was created, the role of FEC was minimized, and a steady and automatic
flow of funds for project financing was ensured through the transfer to ONE of part of the
VAT allocated to the local communities and the surcharge on the kWh billed to urban
customers and collected by ONE.
Lesson 4. Recovery of the connection cost from rural consumers is possible if spread
monthly over a relative long period of time, at a level appropriate to the means of the rural
population. In the Moroccan project, the willingness to pay and payment capability by rural
consumers led to establishing a monthly connection charge of 40 DH (about US$4.2) over
7 years, plus a charge for electricity consumption billed at the domestic tariff rate.
Lesson 5. Early assessment of the technology and standards available to achieve rural
electrification at low cost should be a prerequisite for planning and designing a rural
electrification program. In the Moroccan project, this was not done because the adoption of
European standards for urban and rural projects (also involving standardized equipment) by
ONE many years ago, made a shift to American standards very difficult. However, based
on a recent study made by ONE with the assistance of consultants, a pilot project is
exploring the feasibility of such a change. The latter, if adopted in appropriate terrain, could
result in insignificant savings in investment costs.
Lesson 6. A contract program between the Government and a Government-owned utility
(ONE in this project) has no effective value because the Government is no legally liable to
meet its commitments as it is not a truly commercial contract. Consequently its non-
compliance with the contract program impedes the utility's ability to meet its own
commitments.

ROYAUME DE MAROC
DEIUXIEME PROJET D'ELECTRIFICATION RURALE (PRET 3262-MOR)
Mission de Preparation du Rapport d'Achetvement du Projet
Aide-Memoire
1.    Une mission de la Banque Mondiale, composee de M. Alvaro J. Covarrubias a
visite le Maroc du 1 au 6 decembre 1997 afin de demarrer la. preparation du Rapport
d'Achevement du Deuxieme Projet d'Electrification Rurale (PNER-II) finance par le pret
3262-MOR. La mission remercie les representants de la Direction du Tresor ainsi que
ceux du Fond d'Equipement Communal (FEC) et de l'Office Nationale de l'Electricite
(ONE) pour la collaboration et I'accueil qui lui a et reserve. L'aide m6moire resume les
sujets principaux discutes et les accords conclus lors de cette mission. La liste de
personnes rencontrees se trouve en Annexe No. 2.
Rapport d'Achevement du Projet de I' Emprunteur
2.    La mission a confirm6 aux representants de la Direction de Tresor, du FEC et de 1'
ONE que, dans le cadre des directives et accords des prets de la Banque Mondiale, les
agences qui beneficient des emprunts ont la responsabilite de preparer, apres cloture du
pret, un rapport d'achevement du projet conjointement avec la Banque. Dans ce cas, le
rapport de l'emprunteur represente la derniere etape du suivi du PNER-II. Le rapport
devrait etre prepare et soumis a la Banque dans un delai de six mois apres cloture du pret,
c'est a dire, le 31 decembre 1997, malgre que les realisations des composantes physiques
du projet ne sont pas encore finies. La mission a encourage la Direction de Tresor, le FEC
et 1' ONE a saisir cette occasion pour faire une evaluation retrospective du PNER-II et
presenter un point de vue independant sur la mesure dans laquelle le proj et a rempli ses
objectifs. ainsi que de s'exprimer librement sur la qualite de 1'action de la Banque. La
Banque, de son cote, preparera un rapport d'achevement du projet dans lequel le rapport
de l'emprunteur et ses commentaires sur la partie preparee par la Banque seront annexes
sans modification. Apres, le rapport sera transmis aux membres du Conseil d'
Administration de la Banque.
3.    Puisque le PNER-II a et execute par l'ONE, la mission a convenu avec la
Direction du Tresor et le FEC que l'ONE preparera le rapport d'ach&vement du projet.
Ce rapport devrait avoir d'environ 10 pages (plus annexes detailles) et, si plus longue, le
rapport devrait avoir un resume analytique qui puisse &re incorpore dans le rapport de la
Banque. Puisque les travaux du PNER-1I ne sont pas encore termines, I'ONE s'est
engage a preparer d'abord un rapport assez detaille de l'avancement du projet et de
1'envoyer par courrier a la Banque au plus tard le 31 decembre 1997. La soumission du
rapport de 1'emprunter ne sera faite qu'a une date ulterieure dans l'annee 1998.
4.    La mission a suggere aux autorites marocaines que les rapports mentionne ci-
dessus fassent le point sur les realisations physiques, les problemes poses par la passation



35
des marches et le decaissement du pret, les etudes realises (tarifs, organisation de l'ONE,
amelioration de la planification et genie des installations de distribution, assurance des
actifs, contr6le des stocks), la negociation du contrat plan ONE-Gouvemement, la
restructuration du financement du projet et, principalement, sur l'achevement des objectifs
physiques et institutionnels envisages initialement. Par exemple, le rapport devrait
exprimer les raisons pour lesquelles le projet n'a accompli les buts financiers (tarifs,
arrieres, creances) et d'autonomie operationnelle et financi&e de l'ONE que vers le fin du
projet.
Plan d'operation future du PNER-II
5.    L'ONE devrait inclure dans le rapport d'achevement du projet son plan pour la
bonne operation future des composantes physiques du PNER-II, en particulier sur les
programmes d'entretien des equipements mis en place et la formation de son personnel
technique. Aussi, ONE et le Gouvemement devront continuer a travailler ensemble dans
solution permanente des problemes financieres de l'ONE.
Indicateurs cles de performance de l'ONE et du PNER-II
6.    L'ONE d6ja utilise un ensemble des indicateurs techniques et de gestion qui
permettent d'evaluer son performance. La mission et l'ONE on accorde que les
indicateurs de performance presentes dans l'Annexe No. 1 seront utilises par l'ONE pour
faire le suivi de son performance future et celle du PNER-II dans le cadre du PERG.
Information et donnees complementaires
7.    L'ONE a delivre a la mission le rapport No.8 sur l'avancement du PNER-II
jusqu'a fin decembre 1996 et une bonne partie des informations et donnees
complementaires demandees par la mission. Celles que l'ONE n'est pas delivrees avant le
depart de la mission, seront envoyees a la Banque Mondiale par courrier au plus tard le 15
decembre 1997.

I - INTRODUCTION
Conscient   de  l'importance  de  l'6lectrification  dans  le
developpement socio-economique et la promotion du monde rural, les pouvoirs
publics ont instaure vers la fin des annee 1970 un Programme National
d'Electrification Rurale (PNER I ) visant a long terme l'electrification entiere de la
campagne marocaine
La premi&re phase de ce programme (PNER I) a ete realis6e
durant la periode 1980 - 1986 permettant 1'electrification de 287 villages repartis
dans 21 provinces du Royaume. Elle a beneficie a environ 400 000 habitants ( soit
68 000 foyers) pour un cofit global de l'ordre de 520 millions de Dirhams dont
36,3 millions USD finances par la BIRD dans le cadre dii pret n1695 MOR. la
realisation du PNER I a permis d'accroitre le taux d'electrification rurale de 18%
et ce taux est passe de 7% en 1980 a 25% en 1986.
Au cours de la realisation du PNER I et dans le cadre de la
preparation du plan d'orientation 1988 - 1992, les pouvoirs publics ont decide de
continuer l'e1ectrification du pays dans le cadre d'une deuxieme phase subdivis6e
en 7 tranches denommees D, E, F, G, H, I, et J permettra au terme de sa realisation
d'atteindre un taux d'electrification rurale de 45% et de financer a environ
1 160 000 habitants (soit environ 195 000 foyers).
Les tranches D et E ont concerne l'electrification de 284 villages
(d'autres centres ou extensions ont et 6lectrifies dans le cadre du projet suite a des
besoins supplementaires exprimes par les autorites competentes) et sont acheves
avec le concours financier de la Banque Europeenne d'Investissement (BEI). Le
cout global s'eleve a environ 682 millions de Dirhams (Part BEI 325 millions de
MAD soit 30 millions XEU, part Collectivites Locales 357 millions MAD).
Compte tenu des problemes rencontres lors de la realisation du
PNER et du rythme d'electrification du rnilieu rural de 40 a 70 villages par an,
l'ONE a etudie en 1995 un autre plan d'e1ectrification rurale global (PERG). Ce
plan se basant sur un nouveau mode de financement, doit permettre d'accelerer et
de generaliser l'electrification rurale du Royaume a l'horizon de 2010.
Pour tester le resultat de ce progranmme PERG, l'ONE a decide
de mettre en oeuvre un programme Pre-PERG permettant d'electrification de 420
villages.
I1 est a signaler que les travaux de la sous tranche (<HIJ) du
PNER seront realises dans le cadre du PERG I (1996-1997), dont les marches
sont notifies au mois de Juin 1996, et qu'avec la mise en oeuvre du PERG I, le
PNER s'ach6vera avec la realisation des travaux de la sous tranche complementaire
FG (CFG) qui perrnettra l'electrification de 144 villages.



41
II - DESCRIPTION DU PROJET
La deuxieme phase du PNER <tranche FG et complement FG)> a
pour objet l'electrification de 423 villages et necessite la mise en oeuvre des
equipements suivants:
- 2 341 Km de lignes de reseau moyenne tension
- 1 874 Km de lignes de reseau basse tension
- 325 postes de transformation
- 76 496 branchements d'abonnes basse tension
- Acquisition de moyens et locaux d'exploitation
m - COUT ET FINANCEMENT
Le coubt du projet a ete evalue en liaison avec la Banque
Mondiale a environ 1 885 millions MAD. La part en devise du projet est financ6e
par le montant du pret BIRD n 3262 MOR qui s'eleve a 114 millions USD (soit
CV de 970 millions MAD environ avec 1 USD = 8,5 MAD) reparti comme suit:
- 94,9 millions USD retrocede par l'Etat Marocain represente par
le Ministere des Finances aux Collectivites Locales par l'intermediaire du Fonds
d'Equipement Communal (FEC)
- 19,1 millions USD retrocede par l'Etat Marocain represente par
le Ministere des Finances a l'Office National de l'Electricite (ONE) pour le
financement des travaux des branchements d'abonnes basse tension.
Les modalites de financement du pr8t BIRD sont les suivantes:
. Categorie I - Fournitures: 100 % des depenses en devises et en monnaie locale
. Categorie I - Travaux et montage: 56 % des depenses en monnaie locale
. Categorie HI - Etudes et consultants : 100 % des depenses en devises et en
monnaie locale
II est a signaler que le couit global du projet ( part devises + part
locale non financee par BIRD) est pris en charge en totalite par les Collectivites
Locales

partie FEC et 19,1 millions USD pour la partie ONE.
IV- 4 - Annulation partielle du pret
Dans le cadre de la revue du portefeuille de la BIRD au Maroc,
la Banque Mondiale a propose une restructuration du projet notamment la partie
du pret non encore engagee relative a la sous tranche du PNER ((HU)> qui sera
realisee dans le cadre du Programme d'Electrification Rurale Globale (PERG).
Suite A cette operation, il a ete procede a deux annulations
successives du montant du pr& d'un montant de 74,4 millions USD reparti comme
suit:
. 60,1 millions USD annu1l dont 50 millions USD sur la partie du pret
affectee au FEC et 1O,1 millions USD sur la partie du pret affectee a l'ONE.
. 14,4 millions USD annule dont 12 millions USD sur la partie du prt
affectee au FEC et 2,4 millions USD sur la partie du pret affectee A l'ONE.
V - CONDIMIONS PARTICULIERES
V -1 - Concernant la politique tarifaire nationale
jusqu'A fin 1995 elle pechait par un certain nombre
d'imperfection dont notamment la disparite des tarifs de vente aux Regies et
l'absence de tarif de pointe, en partie responsable de I'allure de la courbe de charge
nationale marquee par une forte cr8te entre 1 7h et 23h et un tres faible appel de
puissance durant les heures creuses (Oh a 6h).
En consequence de cette demande disparate durant la journee,
l'ONE ne peut exploiter de fa9on optimale son parc de production qui sous-
exploite durant les heures creuses, doit faire appel durant les heures de pointe aux
moyens de production a cofit e1ev&
La seule facon de pallier ces difficultes est d'agir sur la demande
pour la gerer, voire la discipliner, en vue de rationaliser l'usage de l'electricite.
L'ONE a ainsi proposer, des Decembre 1994, une reforme de la tarification basee
sur les principes suivants:
. L'adoption d'une tarification tri-horaire pour les clients THT-HT et MT afin de
les inciter a consommer en dehors des heures de pointe. Les tranches horaires
varient selon la saison (la pointe est de 17h a 22h l'hiver et de 18h a 23h 1'ete)
* La creation d'une tranche de consommation sociale, moins de 100 Kwh, pour les
menages a faibles revenus Le tarif correspondant, concemant plus de 50% des
foyers, n'a pas connu d'augmentation;



44
. L'amenagement, en BT, de tranches de consommation ciblees;
. L'augmentation importante des tarifs des tranches de consommation superieures
pour inciter les abonnes a recourir a d'autres formes d'energie et a acquerir des
equipements a faible consommation d'electricite,
. La recherche de la verite des prix,
. L'incitation des industriels et clients autres que domestiques au passage a un
niveau de tension superieur quand leur consommation le justifie;
. l'unification des tarifs de vente aux Regies Municipales de Distribution;
. L'institution d'une taxe de developpement de 2 cDH/ Kwh pour l1'lectrification
rurale,
- Les tarifs des abonnes agricoles (MT4) n'ont pas connu de changement.
toutefois, une etude d'evaluation a et lanc6e aupres des utilisateurs afin de tester
leur degre de comprehension, de satisfaction et d'attente, ainsi que l'efficacite du
tarif.
Cette reforme a ete approuvee par le gouvernement et est entee
en vigueur a compter du mois de Janvier 1996.
V - 2- Concernant la gestion des stocks de l'ONE
L'etude de reorganisation lancee par l'ONE, apres consultation
restreinte, sur la base d'une liste arretee en accord avec la BIRD, ffit confiee au
cabinet Consultant BOSSARD (France), assiste du cabinet marocain MESNAOUI,
pour la partie relative a la gestion des stocks et approvisionnements. Cette etude a
pour objectif la mise en place d'une structure plus performante, d'outils de gestion
plus efficace et de procedures mises a jour et formalisees pour aboutir a:
I I'autonomie de gestion des trois activites de l'Office ( production, transport et
distribution)
l Ia decentralisation de la prise de decision
. la mise en place d'un contr6le de gestion et d'une comptabilite analytique
. la mise en place d'un nouveau systeme d'information
l Ia mise en place d'une nouvelle politique de gestion des ressources humaines
Ia refonte des procedures de controle et d'approbation des investissements, des
approvisionnements et de la gestion des stocks
La mission de reorganisation a demarre le 07 juin 1995 et la
nouvelle structure a et definie debut 1996. La mise en oeuvre s'est effectuee tout
au long de l'annee 1996 et les procedures de gestion ont ete redigees et mises en
oeuvre.

V -3- Concernant la formation du personnel
L'ONE a choisi le cabinet BOSSARD-Consultant pour l'assister
dans la definition et la mise en place de structures performantes (nouvelle
organisation et procedures). La mission    a ete lancee en Juin 1995 avec
l'etablissement du diagnostic de l'organisation actuelle. Parmi les points les plus
importants est la dynaniisation des hommes par la mise en place du management
par objectif et la formation et le perfectionnement.
VI - OBSTACLES
Le projet a accuse un decalage dans son lancement des le depart
du essentiellement, a un retard dans la mise en vigueur du pret BIRD.
En effet l'accord du pr& initial avait ete conclu en date du
14 Juin 1991 dans le cadre d'un partage du cofit du projet entre l'Etat et les
Collectivites Locales a raison de 50% chacun. Mais en raison du transfert de
certaines depenses d'investissement de l'Etat aux Collectivites Locales, il a ete
decide de faire supporter a ces dernibres la totalite du cout du projet notamment la
prise en charge du pret BIRD affecte au FEC.
Pour concretiser cette operation, un accord de pret modifie a ete
conclu entre la BIRD et le Ministere des Finances en date du 11 Novembre 1992
avec l'entree en vigueur le 9 Fevrier 1993.
Le deuxieme obstacle majeur et qui a entrainm egalement un
retard appreciable dans le lancement du projet etait le refus du Ministbre des
Finances d'utiliser la procedure d'engagement special pour les marches de
fournitures etrangeres qui prevoyaient des paiements par accreditif Cette attitude
est une consequence du non octroi de la delegation a l'ONE du pouvoir de
signature des demandes de retrait de fonds a l'instar de ce qui a ete fait dans le
cadre du PNER I.
Apres plusieurs mois de discussion avec le Ministere des
Finances, et le FEC, un accord a ete donne a l'ONE pour l'utilisation de la
procedure d'engagement special BIRD relatif au paiement par accreditif.
Le troisieme obstacle qui merite d'etre souleve etait la non
utilisation par l'ONE de la possibilite qui etait offerte par l'accord de pret d'ouvrir
des comptes de <<Fonds de Roulement aussi bien par la partie ONE que pour la
partie FEC. Ceci est dfi a la complexite du mecanisme instaure par la note
circulaire de Juin 1990 du Ninist6re des Finances et qui etait incompatible avec nos
procedures intemes.
Par ailleurs, cette note circulaire prevoyait l'obligation d'ouvrir
ce Fonds aupres de la Tresorerie G6ndrale et de supporter les interets a partir de
I'alimentation du Fonds par la BIRD et non au fur et a mesure des utilisation par
l'ONE.

VHII- CONCLUSION
Le projet PNER II - tranche ((FG et Complement FG>> nous
permis electrification de 465 villages correspondant a une population estimee A
440 000 habitants soit 68 000 foyers environ.
Le projet nous a permis egalement d'augmenter par consequent
le taux electrification rurale de 3,5 % environ.
Par ailleurs, la complexite du montage financier du projet
( plusieurs intervenants) a rendu le projet difficilement gerable en plus de
1'endettement des communes devenu tres important ce qui a amen6 notre Office a
l'etude d'un nouveau montage financier plus souple et plus allege pour les
communes dans le cadre du Programme d'Electrification Rurale Globale (PERG).
11 y a lieu de signaler que la procedure de passation des marches
<(cle en main>) adoptee dans la realisation d'une partie du projet a facilite
l'acceleration de la realisation du projet.
