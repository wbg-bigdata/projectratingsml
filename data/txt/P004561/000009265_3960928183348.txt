MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A FIRST WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE AND SANITATION SECTOR PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of the Philippines for US$85 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would help finance a water supply, sewerage and sanitation sector project and
would be for a term of 20 years, including a five-year grace period, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate.
2.         Backaround. The provision of water supply, sewerage and sanitation services in the
Philippines has improved considerably over the past two decades. Nevertheless, significant
*           investment in the sector is still needed in view of rapid population growth, the still low levels
of coverage in rural areas where most of the population lives, the poor quality of existing service
in many locations, and the need to cater for future economic expansion. In 1987, about 63% of
the total population of 57.4 million had access to safe water supplies, including 86% of the
population in Metropolitan Manila, 55% in other urban areas and 62% in rural areas. The quality
of service in the areas covered was often noor, however, and the 21.2 million people still
unserved by water supply systems depended on water sources of doubtful quality. As of end-
1986, about 69% of all households had safe excreta disposal faciiii;m, about 15% had unsafe
facilities and about 16% were totally unserved. Of the 17.3 million people underserved or
unserved countrywide, the majority, 12.6 million, were in the rural areas. One reflection of the
level and quality of servIce in the sector is the country's steadily increasing morbidity rate and
a 3.2% a year increase in the number of cases of diarrheal diseases during 1981-85. The
Government is attempting to respond to the need for improved and expanded service in the
sector, particularly in the rural areas, through its Water Supply, Sewerage and Sanitation Master
Plan 1988-2000, which provides a well-integrated, ambitious package of policies, programs and
projects.
3.        In line with its overall movement toward decentralization, the Government intends
to involve local government units at the provincial, municipal and village levels in the planning,
implementation, and operation and maintenance of development activities under the Master Plan.
Provincial Water Supply, Sewerage and Sanitation Sector Plans will therefore be prepared and
implemented to achieve the objectives of the Master Plan but under the overall coordination of
the provincial and municipal governments, with the aim of promoting community self-reliance
in sector activities. Local waterworks and sanitation associations will also be formed and trained
to operate and maintain facilities at the village level.
4.         The proposed project would support these initiatives by financing rural water
supply and sanitation investments included in the Sector Master Plan and by providing training
and technical assistance to the local government staff and rural communities preparing and
implementing Provincial Sector Plans and maintaining facilities provided under the project. The
project reflects the Bank's current sectoral strategy, which is aimed at supporting sector-type
operations under the Master Plan, with an emphasis on meeting the basic needs of the poor in
the rural and provincial areas. This is the eighth Bank-assisted project in the sector since 1977,
and its design particularly reflects experience gained during implementation of a Rural Water
Supply and Sanitation Project (Loan 2206-PH), which is expected to be completed by June 30,
1990.
S.         Rationale for Bank Involvement. The project addresses several areas of special
importance. By providing safe water supplies and improved sanitation in the rural areas, it
would meet important basic needs of the rural population, the majority of whom are poor.
Project-supported sanitation investments would help improve environmental conditions in the
targeted areas. And, by promoting institutional changes to enlarge the role of women in sectoral



-2 -
operations in the rural areas, it would increase the involvement of women in the development
process. The project would also allow the Bank to continue its sectoral dialogue with
Government, which has bern important both in gaining Government acceptance of community
and local government participation in preparins provincial sector investment plans as well as in
identifying external financial support for the investments proposed. The project provides the
Bai-k with an opportunity to assist Government in establishing a set of integrated procedures,
practices and standards for the implementation of rural projects in the sector. Among other
things, this should help to facilitate and coordinate the mobilization of financial support by other
donors and lending agencies in implementing the Sector Master Plan and in reaching the
approximately 25 provinces with about 16 million rural people not yet included in identified
rural water sup$y projects.
6.        Proiect Obiectives. The primary project objective is to assist Government to meet
the basic needs of the rural population through the provision of safe, adequate and easily
accessible water supplies as well as adequate sanitation. Institutionally, the project is aimed at
(a) promoting effective community participation to achieve sustainable sector development; (b)
developing organizational arrangements for improved operation and maintenance of water supply
facilities; (c) supporting government decentralization by providing local government units with
a greater role in planning, implementation and monitoring of sector activities; and (d) training
staff in the planning and implementation of water supply and sanitation systems.
7.         Proiect Descrigtion. The proposed project would help finance rural water supply
and sanitation investments included in the Government's Sector Master Plan 1988-2000. The
project would include: (a) the provision by the Department of Public Works and Highways
(DPWH) of safe, accessible water supplies to some 18,000 rural communities in about 37
provinces in the Luzon area, largely through the construction of wells and development of
springs; (b) the provision of sanitation facilities by the Department of Health (DOH) to rural
communities nationwide, including the provision of toilet facilities for about one million
households; (c) technical assistance for (i) project implementation, (ii) the preparation of
Provincial Sector Plans, (iii) updating of the Master Plan, (iv) training and community
development for the local staff and communities which will operate and maintain facilities
provided under the project, (v) quality assurance and control, and (vi) the preparation of
feasibitity and other studies by the Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) for the
prepatation of future projects. The training and community development component would be
carried out by DPWH and DOH, with the assistance of the Department of Local Government
(DLG).
8.         The capabilities of the implementing agencies are adequate to handle the proposed
project activities. Both DPWH and DOH, which would have the greatest project responsibilities,
have already implemented similar works under the earlier Rual Water Supply and Sanitation
Project, and their technical performance, with some exceptions, was satisfactory. Technical
assistance will be provided for project implementation and quality control.
9.         The total cost of the project is estimated at US$132.8 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$54.1 million or 41% of the total. The cost excludes the value
of voluntary contributions in the form of labor, etc. to be made by the beneficiary communities,
which is expected to amount to about P 200 million or 10% of the cost of the water supply
component and about P 600 miilion or 80% for the sanitation component. To ensure continuity
of activities begun under the Bank-assisted Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project and to be
expanded under the proposed project, retroactive financing, not to exceed US$8.5 million, is
recommended for relevant project expenditures made after January 1, 1990. A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement,
the proportions of expenditures to be financed and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in the Philippines are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also



attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8143-PH dated May 31, 1990 is being distributed
separately.
10.        Agreed Actions. The Government has agreed on the. following: (a) the preparation
and implementation of satisfactory Provincial Water Supply, Sewerage and Sanitation Sector Plans
by the 37 provincial governments in Luzon, in acco-dance with agreed guidelines; (b) a program
for implementation of the project; (c) to maintain the Project Coordination Committee during
the project period; (d) the posting by DLG of a Community Organizer to each of the project
provinces during the period of Provincial Sector Plan preparation and implementation; (e) the
training and community development program to be carried out under the project; (f)
implementation of quality assurance measures agreed with the Bank for specified goods provided
under the project; (g) commencing in 1991, Government's biennial review of its water pricing
policy and cost recovery principles, the results and recommendations of such review to be
discussed with the Bank and subsequently implemented in the year of the review; and (h)
provision to women of equal access to membership and management roles in water and sanitation
associations. A condition of loaf effectiveness is the preparation, adoption and putting into
effect of at least eight Provincial sector Plans, approved by the Bank.
II.        Benefits About 3 milion people would benefit from project-supported water
supply facilities, and about 6 million would benefit from sanitary latrines for excreta disposal.
Since diarrheal diseases, which are strongly associated with unsafe water and poor sanitation, are
ranked second among the ten leading causes of morbidity in the Philippines, the safe drinking
water and improved sanitation provided under the project are expected to considerably improve
the health of the population reached, increase their effective nutrition - especially in children
due to the reduction of intestinal parasites - and foster their increased productivity. The project
would also put in place procedures, standards and specifications for the implementation of rural
water and sanitation projects and would thereby facilitate the participation of other donors and
lenders in the sector. It would also promote and formalize an increasingly participatory role
for local government in the planning and implementation of sector activities, in 37 of the
country's 75 provinces. The water supply component, comprising almost 60% of the base cost
of the project, has an estimated weighted economic rate of return of about 8%, which is
satisfactory for a social project of this type. The health and institutional benefits of the project's
other components cannot be quantified.
1.         Women will be the main beneficiaries of the project. In addition to the health
benefits expected, women in the lower income rural households will benefit from the more
accessible water supplies delivered under the project, which would obviate the need to carry
water over long distances. The project has also been designed to increase the participation of
women in planning, operating and maintaining the water and sanitation services provided.
Government has agreed to provide women with equal access to membership and leadership roles
in Barangay Waterv ,rks and Sanitation Associations (BWSAs).
13.        The environmental benefits of the proposed project would be: (a) cleaner home and
community environments; (b) less stream pollution; and (c) more rational and prudent water us
Water supply and sanitary facilities would be planned, designed and constructed under criteria
which protect the conditions of the natra and man-made environment. Such facilities are not
expected to have adverse environmental impacts because of their simplicity and low volumes of
water used. No resettlement of the local population will be required.
14.        Risll. The project's success will depend on the coordinated delivery of water
supply and sanitation improvements with community development and training. To minimize
the risk of poor coordination, the project provides for the establishment of a Project
Coordination Committee to oversee the various project participants, sets out the procedures to
te followed by the Committee and establishes comprehensive performance monitoring
requirements. There is also the risk that the decentralization of responsibilities expected under
the project may not proceed at the pace anticipated. The Bank is concurrently assisting the



- 4 -
Government in carrying out a Decentralization and Local Government De. ielopment Study, which
is expected to lead to recommendations on a fiscal framework that would facilitate government
decentralization plans. Ultimately, however, the sustainability of the project will depend on the
ability and willingness of the local communities to maintain the facilities provided. The large
training and community development program is designed to this end.
1S        Recmendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.
