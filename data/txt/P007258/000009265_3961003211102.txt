MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMEDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMEN ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUIVE DIRECTORS
ON A CREDfT
TO THE REPUBIUC OF GUYANA
EOR THE INQRURU-CIR RE:HAB-IITATION PROJECT
1.           The following memorandum and recommendation of a development credit to the Republic
of Guyana for SDR19 million (US$26.0 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The credit woutd
be on standard terms with 40 years of maturity and would help to finance the Infrastructure Rehabilitation
Project.
2.           IManksgoud: Since 1988, Guyana has been implementing a medium-term Economic
Recovery Program (ERP) aimed at addressing serious domestic and external imbalances in the economy
and establishing the basis for renewed economic growth. The ERP has been supported by an IMF
standby arrangement and an IDA Standard Adjustment Credit both of which were approved in June 1990
as well as by similar assistance from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the Caribbean
Development Bank (CDB), and bilateral donors. Under the ERP, Guyana has undertaken far-reaching
adjustment measures and structural reforms, implying a fumdamental shift in economic policies towards
a market-oriented economy. The overall fiscal deficit has been reduced; the exchange and trade system
has been liberalized and the exchange rate unified; virtually all price controls have been removed and
consumer subsidies eliminated; the incentive framework for the private sector has improved and state
intervention in agricultural, industrial, and commercial activities has been curtailed; progress has been
made in restrucuring and reducing the size of the public sector, includ-ng tax reform, strengthening
expenditure controls and privatization of public enterprises; a shift to market-based instiuments of
monetary control has been initiated; arrears to multilateral and bilateral donors have been cleared; and
a social impact amelioration program has been introduced. However, Guyana's existing debt service
burden continues to place a major constraint on the Government's ability to address the large social and
rastructurat needs of Guyana.
3.           Tramnort Sector: Organization and Constraints: The Ministry of Public Works,
Communications and Regional Development (MOPWCRD) has overall responsibility for the planning,
construction, operation and regulation of the transport sector: through its Road Administration Division
(RAD) for roads, the Transport and Harbors Department (CMD) for ports, shipping and river transport,
and the Civil Aviation Department for airports and airfields, for regulating air transport and for licensing
aircraft and pilots. The Central Transport Planning Unit (CIPU) of the MOPWCRD has the
responsibility for planning and coordinating transport sector investments including integrating the
investment proposals of the sector's agencies and establishing project priorities. CTPU is also responsible
for proposing transport policy changes and for reviewing transport tariffs and charges. The Ministry of
Agriculture (MOA) participates in the sector through the development of the feeder road system.
Although organizationally, the transport sector's management is well covered, the existing decentralized
responsibility for roads to the regions is ineffective. The regions have neither the resources, manpower
nor the technical capacity necessary to carry out their responsibility. The recentralization of
responsibilities, particularly for the main road system, is needed.
4.       The existing transport facilities provide adequate accessibility, in terms of spatial distribution,
to all the economically and socially active parts of the country. No new investments are needed in that
respect, except if major new future agricultural or mining development takes place outside the areas
currently served by the system. Also, except on very few facilitide, transport flows are low and wil



- 2 -
continue to be so for at least the next ten years. Expansion for capacity or major upgrading of the system
would, therefore, not be economically justifiable. Practically all transport facilities are, however, at an
advanced stage of deterioration due to more than a decade of little or no maintenance. Less than 20%
of the road network, for example, is estimated to be in good condition. The emphasis for the short and
medium term therefore clearly needs to be placed on the rehabilitation and better maintenance and
operation of existing facilities. Of priority, in this regard, would be those. facilities needed to permit a
quick supply response in the economy to the ERP.
5.            e  lDefenses: Responsibility for the construction, management and maintenance of the
sea defenses has, since 1982 rested with the regional democratic authorities. A recently enactcd Act,
however, provides for the re-establishment of the Guyana National Sea and River Defenses Board to
oversee all matters concerning sea defenses. The Hydraulics Division (HD) of the Ministry of
Agriculture has, since January 1990, been assigned responsibility for the design and construction program
on all sea defenses. Pending the constitution of the above Board, however, the maintenauxce responsibility
continues to be with the regions. The regional authorities have neither the funds nor the staff capacity
to carry out their responsibilities properly. The responsibiiity for managing and maintaining the coastal
areas needs to be re-centralized within the HD. At the same time, HD does not currently have sufficient
capacity to manage, including design and supervision, the upcoming large sea defenses activity in Guyana
(about UTS$42 million within the next four years). HD will, therefore, have to carry out all rehabilitation
and mamitenance by private contractors and design and works supervision by consultants. HD will need
to be strengthened to manage the consultants' and contractors' activities.
6.           The majority of the sea walls is old, from 25 to 50 years, and in bad condition. A recent
EEC-financed study by consultants to assess the condition of the dams and evaluate alternative designs
for its rehabilitation or reconstruction along the whole of the coastline, concluded that about 36 km of
walls are in such a poor state that immediate action - intermediate repairs or complete replacement - is
called for. The Government's strategy is to focus on the immediate rehabilitation of the areas that are
m critical condition, and on a plan to restructure the physical, financial, and organization problems of
the concerned management agencies. The plan for restructuring would identify the most appropriate
method and design to rehabilitate the entire sea defense system and provide a long term solution to the
problems. Out of the 36 km, which need emergency works, approximately ?,j km will be repaired with
EEC, IDB and CDB financing and about 4 km with IDA financing under the project, following the
recommendations of the study.
7.           Transport Sector Strategy: The Government's strategy for the transport sector is aimed
at rehabilitating the most seriously deteriorated and critical sections of the network, implementing
adequate maintenance systems, strengthening institutional capacity, implementing adequate measures for
cost recovery and making optimal use of potential external financing. The priority investments envisaged
in this regard include: (a) rehabilitation of the Essequibo Coast, Georgetown-Timehri, and Georgetown-
Mahaica roads and feeder roads that serve the agricultural, mining, and forestry sectors and the farming
areas; (b) rehabilitation of ferries, moorings, and the Demerara River Bridge in order to eliminate
bottlenecks in the transportation of agriculture products; (c) improvement of port and airport facilities
in order to facilitate exports and imports.
8.           Rationale for the Bank Group's Involvement: The main elements of the Bank Group's
assistance strategy, over the medium term, are aimed at the continuation of the Economnc Recovery
Program which includes: (a) facilitating the development of the private sector as the principal engine of



economic growth; (b) supporting the Government's privatization and rehabilitation efforts in the key
productive sectors of the economy (including bauxite and sugar) with a view to arresting a further decline
in output and to improve the o-erall performance of these sectors; (c) assisting :n the rehabilitation of
the basic social and economic infrastructure; (d) implementing an economic and sector work program
to support the Government's ERP and to enhance the role of the private sector in the economy, notably
in the development of non-traditional exports; and (e) through the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in
Economic Development (COCED), assisting Guyana ir. its efforts to mobilize the resources needed in
external financing in the form of both balance of payments slipport and new investments to facilitate the
implementation of the Government's Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP). The project would ensure
that thu economic infrastructure needed to support the supply response underlying the ERP's goals is in
place by: (a) helping to repair critical sections of the sea defenses system, which is vital to support
agricultural production, as well as introduce effective coastal area management, (b) rehabilitating critical
components of the transport infrastructure which are necessary for the efficient delivery of farm and
mining inputs and for the evacuation of the country's principal exports, bauxite, sugar and rice, and (c)
improving the management and operational efficiency of transport sector and sea defenses agencies.
9.           Project Objectives. The main objectives of the project would be to: (a) assist in the
immediate repair and reconstruction of deteriorated critical sections of the sea defenses system and lay
the basis for the development of efficient O&M system for sea defenses, (b) improve the overall
performance and efficiency of the management and operations of the transport sector; (c) ,acilitate
agricultural, agro-industrial and mining production, particularly for export, through reduced transport
costs, both from farm to market and from market through export routes to international markets; and
(d) help reduce the need for premature spare parts and fuel imports and replacement of transport vehicles,
thus saving scarce foreign exchange resources. These objectives aim at implementing the medium-term
infrastructure strategy necessary to support a supply response in the economy. It is fully recognized that
other issues exist in the sector which will not be addressed by the project, but over the long-term and
through other instruments.
10.          Project Descrigon. The project would consist of: (a) rehabilitation and subsequent
maintenance of about 4 km of critical sections of the sea defenses system and the establishment of
effective management of the coastal areas within the HD, including the design and implementation of
adequate cost recovery measures to provide reliable .nancing for O&M of the systems as well as
establishment of a data bank on tidal and morphological measurements; (b) rehabilitation with minor
alignment of the Essequibo coast road and the Linden Highway and bridges; (c) preventive maintenance
by a two-year contract for about 88 miles (141 km) of paved roads in the main network; (d) institutional
strengthening of MOPWCRD through technical assistance to the MOPWCRD's Central Transport
Planning Unit (CTPU) for improving transport planning, project formulation and monitoring of potential
environmental impacts, the Road Administration Division (RAD) for the supervision of road
rehabilitation and the THD for ports management. The project will also finance technical and economic
studies for the creation of an off-port container terminal, a study for the establishment of a National Port
Authority, an environmental assessment of the Brazil-Guyana road, a study of highways subsector
financing and the purchase of equipment including fire-fighting equipment for the Timehri Airport and
office equipment. The design of the project incorporates the findings and recommended strategy for
infrastructure of the IDA Infrastructure Strategy Review Paper of 1992. The design of the sea defenses
component also benefits from two donors' meetings in Guyana in 1992 on a common strategy for sea
defenses. Lastly, the recommendations of the project on compensation for MOPWCRD and HD staff are
consistent with those of the proposed IDA Public Administration Reform Project, to be submitted shortly
to the Executive Directors for approval.

11.          The total cost of the project is US$34 million. IDA will finance US$26 million, CDB
has committed to financing US$6 million and the Government will provide US$2.0 million. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan re shown in Schedule A. Amount and methods of
procurement and disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the schedule of Bank operations in Guyana are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The roads
and sea defenses to be rehabilitated or maintained are shown in the attached map. The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 11372-GUA dated Febuary 22, 1993, is also attached.
12.             ect lnRlnentation             Implementation of the project is expected to take
about six years from the third quarter of 1993. Execution of the transport sector components of the
project would be the responsibility of MOPWCRD. The RAD will manage the contracting of road civil
works, and related consulting engineering services for supervision and for its portion of technical
assistance. A Program Executing Unit (PEU) will be estab.Ished in RAD to implement the road
components of the project. MOPWCRD would also be responsible for procurement of office equipment
.'or CTPU and RAD and fire fighting equipment for the Civil Aviation Department (CAD). The Ministry
of Agriculture, through its HD, would be responsible for the implementation of the sea defenses
components of the project. Another Program Executing Unit (PEU) will be established within HD for
the implementation of this component and the IDB, CDB and EEC sea defenses projects. The project
will provide funds for contracting qualified local or foreign experts to fill key positions in both PEUs.
The Government will recruit the corresponding counterpart staff who will be incorated later on as
permanent staff in RAD and HD. The establishment of the above PEUs for roads and sea defenses and
appointment of coordinators will be a condition of credit effectiveness. The timetable for recruitment by
the Government of the counterpart staff was established at negotiations in light of expectations for
introduction of the new salary scheme to be implemented under the proposed Public Administration
Reform Project. Procurement. All civil work contracts will be procured through ICB. Acquisition of
equipment more than US$25,000 will be awarded through LIB and ICB. Disbursements and Special
Account, A Special Account will be established in a bank acceptable to IDA with an initial deposit of
US$2.0 million. Funds from the credit include a project preparation facility advance of US$750,000 and
retroactive financing in an aggregate amount of up to US$450,000 with respect to payments made for
expenditures incurred since April 1992.
13.          Cost Tccu=: The roads subsector, with a total road-user charge receipt per year of
US$16.9 million, fully recovers the cost not only of the US$5 million per year currently spent on roads
but could also cover adequately the estimated US$12 - 14 million needed annually for the next five years
to restore the network and prevent its further deterioration. (The prevailing oil prices are well above
international levels). The problem is one of allocating a sufficient portion of the user-charge receipts for
O&M. At negotiations, the Government agreed to submit not later thm June 30, 1994 an O&M program
for the road network, including the arrangements for its financing, whose implementation is expected to
begin January 1, 1995. Until then, most of the roads in the main network will be rehabilitated and
subsequently maintained for two to three years with IDB, CDB and IDA financing. The project includes
financing for preventive maitenance by contract for the rest of the main network that is maintinable.
IDB is also financing about 1,000 km of minor roads and trails, leaving only some 1,000 km of
secondary and rural roads not specifically covered.  Before the new funding arrangements are
implemented by the Government, the mantaiable part of these latter roads will be financed by the
Treasury. The IDB is also financing consulting services to assist in developing the new maintenance
program.



14.          The limited government financing for s   fene comes in the form of treasury
allocations to the regional councils and to HD. There is no specific cost recovery mechanism for sea
defenses. Donor agencies would have to finance all the rehabilitation and maintenance works for at least
the next three years while the Government puts in place such a mechanism. As part of the preparation
of the project, the Government bas engaged an expert to study the cost recovery and financing of sea
defenses. The results of the study will be discussed with IDA, to agree on the Government's strategy
for financing sea defenses, by September 30, 1993.
15.          EnAIronmental Imnact:  The nature of the projects, mostly improvement and
rehabilitation of existing roads and sea walls in already developed corridors, is such that environment is
not a major issue, except for quarry sites and asphalt fumes during construction. Environmental/soci;'
assessments are being carried out as part of the detailed engineering for the project roads to ensure that
the road designs make adequate provision for: (a) sufficient control of asphalt fumes; (b) redressing
damage at quarry sites; (c) adequate shoulders for safety; (d) safe sites for sales stands for local peasants
and artisans, and adequate provision for non-motorized traffic, where applicable; (e) protection of cultural
and iourist sites; and (f) adequate cross-walks in urban areas. The construction technical specifications
for the proposed roads would provide adequate protection from dust and air pollution during construction.
Moreover, the MOPWCRD has undertaken to appoint an Environmental Officer in the CTPU to assist
in monitoring the incorporation of environmentl considerations in the planning, design, implementation
and maintenance of transport facilities and in the operation of transport services.
16.          Aged Aetion       Roads and Sea Defenses O&M Funding and AdministratigA. The
Government has confirmed, by legal opinion, that RAD is responsible for all roads and HD for all sea
defenses The establishment of PEUs for roads and sea defenses, in RAD and HD (which will be
responsible for the implementation of the project) including the appointment of coordinabtors, is a
condition of effectiveness. The Government will provide, by September 30, 1993, the necessary funds
in the budget to operate the units. The Government will also appoint an environmental officer for CTPU
not later than December 31, 1993 and will .anter into arrangements with the Guyana Agency for Health,
Environment and Food (GAHEF), to organize training programs for MOPWCRD, by June 30, 1993.
The Government will present a road financing study to IDA and discuss with the Association, not later
than June 30, 1994, the results of the study, including an implementation schedule for the agreed
recommendations and a needs-based road maintenance program and budget covering the period January
1995-December 1998. The Ministry of Finance is carrying out a study for the cost recovery for sea
defenses O&M under the PPF for the project. The Government will furnish to IDA the study's results
by September 30, 1993 and will prepare a plan of action for the implementation of the agreed
recommendations not later than June 30, 1994, and then carry out the plan in accordance with its
timetable. The Brazil-Guyana Road. To mitigate possible negative environmental effects of this road
(not financed by IDA), the project includes financing for an environmental assessment. The Government
will discuss the results of the study with IDA by December 31, 1993 and agree on needed actions.
Project Monitoring. MOPWCRD and MOA will prepare quarterly reports on their respective components
for IDA, providing information on project progress and expenditures. Furthermore, to monitor progress
towards civil works and institutional development objectives of the project, it was agreed at negotiations
that the Government will at minimum meet with IDA representative twice, yearly. One of these reviews,
to be carried out by June 30, 1996 will be a formal mid-term review. At negotiations, it was agreed that
the mie-term review will cover: physical progress of the project; execution of the institutional
strengthening program; implementation of the road maintenance plan; compliance with an agreed action
program; and, the arrangements and schedule for the transition of key positions in the PEUs, initially
staffed by IDA-financed staff, to Government staff. The supervision of project implementation will be



- 6 -
carried out according to a supervision strategy defined in the project, which includes the hiring of local
consultants and an extended monitoring and reporting role to oe played by the Borrower.
17.          Poect Benefits. Cost savings to road users and avoidance of major road reconstruction
costs and preservation of the sea defenses, o protect agricultural, capital infrastructure and residential
areas would be the primary benefits of the project. The estimated ERRs of the project range between
20 and 30% for the road components to about 39% for the sea defenses component. The overall ERR
for the investment component, about 80% of total project wosts, is about 33%. Significantbenefits would
also accrue from the institutional strengthening and training and research programs.
18.         JPrject Risks. There is a risk that project implementation could be delayed because of
the lack of timely counterpart funding. This risk will be minimized through cofinancing arrangements
with CDB which leaves the Government to firance US$2.0 million (6% of project costs). Also the
allocation of adequate budgetary provisions on an annual basis is a condition of the credit. At
negotiations, the Governmert confirmed its capacity to provide these funds. There is a risk that project
benefits may not be fully sustained after project completion because of MOPWCRD's weak institutional
capacity. The Government has undertaken to assign suitable counterparts under the project who will,
after project completion, assume the key responsibilities within the implementing agencies. Furthermore,
both the IDB Technical Cooperation Agreement and its on-going Road Rehabilitation Project include
institutional strengthening of the RAD. Las ly, under the proposed IDA Public Administration Reform
Project, the conditions would be created to make the recruitment and retention of both experienced
G3uyanese and new engineers easier through enhanced compensation at the engineers' level.
Recommendation
19.          I am satisfied that the credit complies with the articles of agreement of the Association
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the credit.
