LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:            Jamaica Public Service Company, Limited (JPSC)
Guarantor:           Jamaica
Amount:              US$20 million
Terms:               Payable in 17 years, including four years of grace at
7.45% per annum.
Project
Description:        The project is a part of JPSC's 1978-82 construction
program, which has as its principal objective increas-
ing the reliability of JPSC service. Physical invest-
ment will be concentrated in installing transmission
and distribution facilities. The Bank loan would
finance the foreign exchange costs of that part of JPSC's
1978-82 transmission distribution program that has not
been financed by other sources. The project would also
assist JPSC in improving its operating and maintenance
practices and its pricing policies through the use of
specialized consulting services and through training
its staff. In line with the Government's social
objectives, the JPSC program includes making public
service electricity available to low income and rural
customers. Domestic bidders would receive a 15% margin
of preference in bidding on project items. The project
does not pose any significant risks other than what are
normally associated with this type of undertaking.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO
THE JAMAICA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY, LIMITED
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF JAMAICA
FOR A SECOND POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Jamaica Public Service Company, Limited, with the guarantee of Jamaica,
for the equivalent of US$20.0 million. The loan would have a term of 17 years,
including four years of grace, with interest at 7.45% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
Introduction
2.        An Economic Report entitled "Current Economic Situation and Pros-
pects of Jamaica" was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 22,
1976. Updating missions visited Jamaica in August 1976, January 1977, March
1977, August 1977 and October 1977. The Country Data Sheets are attached as
Annex I.
Background
3.        Many of the long-term structural problems of the Jamaican economy
today have their origin in the pattern of growth of the 1960s. During the
decade following independence in 1962, Jamaica experienced rapid economic
growth, averaging about 6% per annum in real terms. Growth was spurred by
major developments in tourism and in bauxite and alumina production. Tourist
visitors increased from 200,000 in 1962 to 500,000 in 1972, while over the
same period bauxite production expanded from 8 million tons to 13 million tons,
and the output of alumina rose from 650,000 tons to 2 million tons. Large
private capital inflows from abroad underpinned investments in these sectors,
and these same capital inflows enabled Jamaica to finance increasing deficits
on the current account of the balance of payments. The decade of the sixties
was, therefore, a period of high investment and rising incomes. However, the
growth of other sectors was less buoyant. To begin with, investment during
this period bypassed the agricultural sector, the traditional source of
Jamaica's income and employment opportunities. Agricultural production
stagnated and there was increasing migration to urban areas. Moreover,
import-substituting manufacturing, mainly of consumer goods, continued to grow
under high levels of effective protection. This, in combination with liberal
tax incentives and a high industrial wage structure led to the development of
1/   The "Background" and "The Economic Crisis of 1976" sections of this Part
are substantially the same as the similarly titled sections of Part I
of the President's Report of November 21, 1977 for the Jamaica Program
Loan. The latter sections of Part I, however, differ from Part I of the
November 21 Report to reflect recent economic developments.



-2-
a sector which was excessively capital intensive, provided relatively little
employment and was heavily dependent on the import of intermediate goods. The
failure to foment agricultural and manufacturing production for exports made
bauxite and alumina exports, which already accounted for over one-half of
total exports in 1966, rise to about 70% by 1972. Finally, the pattern of
development of the economy failed to narrow the extreme inequality of Jamaica's
income distribution. Thus, by the early 1970s, Jamaica was suffering from
serious unemployment and social tensions.
4.        The Government which came to power in 1972 was committed to reducing
the inequality in the distribution of income, alleviating unemployment and
reducing the country's external dependence. It embarked upon a development
program emphasizing greatly increased government ownership of and control over
the country's productive resources and promised expanded popular participation
in decision making. Economic diversification, employment and redistribution
of income were set forth as priority goals, with economic growth considered a
subsidiary, albeit important, goal. This strategy created an atmosphere of
uncertainty with immediate result of reduced investment activity by the
private sector.
5.        The implementation of the structural changes sought by the Govern-
ment was further complicated by unforeseen external factors. The completion
of a major investment cycle in tourism and mining in Jamaica resulted in a
sharp drop in foreign capital inflows beginning in 1972. This was followed
by the increase in petroleum and other commodity prices in late 1973 which
resulted in severe deterioration in the country's terms of trade. Moreover,
the world recession of 1974-75 had serious repercussions on Jamaica's tourism
and mining sector receipts. The Government was able to counteract the effects
of these unfavorable developments by the introduction of a bauxite levy, which
yielded an additional US$150 million in foreign exchange receipts. This,
together with the near doubling of international sugar prices and the unpre-
cedented level of external medium- and long-term borrowing by the public
sector in 1975 rescued Jamaica from a serious balance of payments crisis. W4fhile
the bauxite levy and the temporary upsurge in sugar prices did not resolve
the underlying weaknesses in the economy, they did provide a temporary respite.
Thus, despite a loss of foreign exchange reserves of US$82 million in 1975,
the economic situation did not become critical until 1976.
The Economic Crisis of 1976
6.        The balance of payments situation deteriorated sharply in 1976.
Serious labor problems in the mining sector together with soft world demand
for aluminum reduced total bauxite and alumina export receipts by about 14%.
Receipts from sugar exports in 1976 were only 40% of the 1975 level, owfng
to much lower international prices for sugar. Moreover, as internal security
became more precarious, Jamaica did not benefit from the recovery of tourism
evident in the rest of the Caribbean during the year. Thus, despite strict
controls which resulted in a 19% drop in merchandise imports, the current
account balance deteriorated further in 1976, with the deficit reaching
US$295 million. (See Annex I for details.)



-3-
7.        Adverse development on capital account made the balance of payments
situation even more difficult. Foreign commercial bank lending to Jamaica
practically ceased, and capital flight accelerated owing to the prevalence of
Dolitical and economic uncertainty. There was a net outflow of direct private
investment funds for the third consecutive year. A large part of the credits
received by the public sector were government-to-government loans from Jamaica's
CARICOM partners (Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and Guyana), Venezuela and
Canada. The IMfF extended a total of US$65 million in credits to Jamaica under
its oil and compensatory facilities. Despite these credits, the country
suffered a net reserve loss in 1976 of US$268 million. By December 21, 1976,
the gross official reserves had fallen to US$41 million, equivalent to two
weeks of imports, and the authorities were forced to close the foreign exchange
markets for a period of two weeks.
8.        The balance of payments difficulties have been accompanied by, and
in part reflect, problems of budgetary management. Growth in current expen-
ditures over the past few years has consistently outstripped that of current
revenues as the Government introduced social welfare schemes to ameliorate
the effects of high unemployment. At the same time, Government investment
expenditure rose rapidly as the Government tried to carry out its ambitious
program.   Thus, Government expenditure in 1976/77 1/ increased by 20% over
1975/76 (see Table 1), the bulk of the increase being transfers to public
entities, as well as new grants and loans to industry, construction and
tourism, in an effort to stimulate the lagging economy. Concomitantly,
current revenues were 5% below the 1975 level, because of shortfalls in
customs duty and consumption tax receipts resulting from the import cutbacks.
As a consequence, the overall deficit of the Central Government increased to
the equivalent of 18.6% of GDP, compared to a figure of under 11% in 1975/76.
Since this coincided with a modest reduction in foreign financing, there was
unprecedented reliance on financing from the banking system equivalent to
11.6% of GDP.
1/   Fiscal year runs from April 1 to March 31.

9.        As a consequence of the decline in bauxite production, poor tourism
performance and the adverse effect of import restrictions on industrial
imports, real GDP fell by almost 7% in 1976. This followed three successive
years of negative real growth rate. The only major sectors which exhibited
positive growth were agriculture and government services. Unemployment, a
chronic problem in Jamaica, increased to about 24-% from about 21% in 1975.

The Government's Response to the Crisis
10.       In January of 1977, after having been re-elected, the Government,
began to take measures to alleviate the country's severe economic problems.
It introduced new revenue measures expected to yield J$80 million annually.
New wage guidelines were instituted under which wage and salary increases in
the private sector and in government-owned enterprises that are run as commer-
cial establishments would be granted (as contracts fall due) only for those
employees whose real wages were below the June 1973 level. This applied to
only a small part of the labor force. Even in these cases, wage increases
would not be permitted to exceed a flat J$10 per week for the 12-month period
that began July 1, 1977. Moreover, the wage freeze for employees of the
Central Government and Statutory Boards, which was due to expire in March
1977, was extended until March 31, 1978. On the external side, there was a
sharp reduction in the ceiling for the issuance of import licenses and tighten-
ing of restrictions on payments for certain invisibles. In addition, a dual
exchange rate system was instituted in April. Under this system, a new
"special" exchange rate of US$1.00=J$1.25 was established for all transactions
except essential imports and transactions of the Government and bauxite
sector, which remained at the old ("basic") exchange rate of US$1.00=J$0.909.
This implied a weighted average devaluation of about 24%. 1/ Concurrently,
1/   Subsequent exchange rate adjustments (see para. 14 below) have brought
the weighted average devaluation to about 40% in relation to US$ and
to a slightly larger percentage in relation to SDRs.



-6-
the Government unveiled an Emergency Production Plan, setting out targets
and strategies for increasing production. Finally, in May, a fiscal budget
for 1977/78 was adopted which called for a sharp reduction in the deficit,
primarily through restraints in expenditures.
11.       In July 1977, the Government adopted a comprehensive program
covering a period of almost two years. This program was the basis for
reaching agreement with the IMF on a Stand-by arrangement, which was approved
by the Fund's Executive Directors in August. Full adherence to the program
would have made Jamaica eligible to draw a total of SDR 64 million (US$74
million) over this period, or into the fourth credit tranche. The key elements
of the program were:
(a) ceilings on net credit to the public sector from the banking
system;
(b) limits on the net domestic assets of the Bank of Jamaica to
ensure that the monetary and credit program of the Government
would be compatible with the planned improvement in the
balance of payments;
(c) limits on the authorization of new foreign indebtedness of
the public sector to ensure that the terms of foreign
borrowing are appropriately related to the country's debt
servicing capability;
(d) quarterly targets for increases in net international reserves
during 1977 and 1978;
(e) provisions for orderly management of payments arrears; and
(f) adjustment in the exchange rate system and avoidance of any
further intensification of import restrictions.
12.       Under the IMF Stand-by arrangement, Jamaica drew the first tranche
of SDR 19.2 million (US$22 million). The first review of the progress on the
quarterly targets took place in October/November 1977, when a Bank staff
member accompanied the Fund mission to Jamaica. On the basis of this review,
it was concluded that Jamaica had fulfilled all the quarterly criteria of the
program and appeared likely to remain in compliance with the credit ceilings,
which were being monitored by the Fund on a weekly basis, on the date of the
request for the second drawdown of funds. The request for this drawdown,
amounting to SDR 9.6 million (US$10.5 million) could only take place after
December 1, 1977. The second quarterly review of performance was scheduled
for February, 1978 as prelude to the third drawdown. Eligibility for this
drawing could only be established and funds drawn after March 1, 1978.
13.       The Government's economic program reflected its decision to adopt the
measures required to cope with the serious economic situation, in spite of the
political difficulties associated with such a course of action. The Government
failed, however, to meet the December target established for the limit on the



level of net domestic assets of the Bank of Jamaica described in paragraph
11(b) above. In part this excessive expansion was the result of a reduction
in deposits by public enterprises. Net public sector credit from the banking
system, however, was within the agreed limits, since a relatively liquid
private sector provided a market for Government bonds. Taking into account
the causes and implications of the Government's failure to restrain domestic
credit expansion, the IMF was not prepared to approve a second drawing under
the Stand-by arrangement. As a result, the Government was unable to draw
on external commercial bank resources; this, in combination with the non-
availability of an anticipated loan from Trinidad and Tobago caused the
Government to fail the test under paragraph 11(d) above for increasing net
international reserves. Despite the failure to meet fully the targets estab-
lished under the stabilization program, the program as a whole achieved some
significant successes. Moreover, the Government installed a system of fiscal
controls and review which give promise of better future performance; demon-
strated its ability to execute a flexible exchange rate policy through the
October devaluation; and maintained an incomes policy which, in general, was
able to prevent real wage increases from exceeding the 1973 level. However,
with prices having risen 10% in 1976 and rising at a 15% rate in 1977 (see
paragraph 22 below), the Government was beginning to feel increasing pressures
to relax its incomes policy late in 1977, and some wage increases in excess of
the Government's announced norms were awarded.
14.       As a result of the slippages under the two-year program which had
been agreed to with the Fund, the Government reexamined the constraints that
such a program would imply. In addition to the problem of maintaining a
successful incomes policy, the Government was also concerned about the extent
of the decline in output and the increase in unemployment that were accom-
panying the program. Rather than readjust the targets for a two-year stabili-
zation program, the Government and the Fund agreed that the program should be
revamped and negotiations have now begun for a three-year Extended Fund
Facility arrangement, which would permit a longer period for adjustment and
also provide a higher level of financial assistance from the IMF. In announcing
on January 13 the negotiations to be conducted with the Fund, the Government
stated in clear terms its commitments to a flexible exchange rate policy, its
willingness to adopt austerity measures and its continued concern with its most
economically disadvantaged citizens. To give substance to its exchange rate
policy commitment, the Government instituted an immediate devaluation of both
the "basic" and "special" exchange rates. The "basic" rate was moved from
US$1.00=J$0.91 to US$1.00=J$1.05 and the "special" rate was moved from
US$1.00=J$1.28 to US$1.00=J$1.35. The weighted average effect of the devalua-
tion on current transactions is estimated to have been about 10%. Simulta-
neously, the minimum wage was increased from J$20 to J$24 and adjustments made
to pensions. In addition, the price of petroleum was increased so that, in
effect, petroleum was moved from the "basic" to the "special" rate.
15.       While Fund negotiations were under way in June 1977, the Government
started negotiations with bilateral and multilateral sources as well as with
foreign commercial banks for a package of extraordinary external financing for
1977 and 1978 (see Table 3). The financing plan was based on a detailed

analysis of the size of the external resource gap and was premised on the
Government's ability to restrict the current account deficit to US$120 million
in 1977, to reduce it to US$77 million in 1978 and to nearly eliminate it by
1980. As a result of the restructuring of the economic program, estimates of
the size of the external resource gap will have to be revised and adjustments
made in the arrangements for mobilizing external financing. (The "as projected
now" figures in Table 3 are staff estimates indicative of levels which now seem
feasible in 1978.)
16.       A loan of US$49 million had been expected from Trinidad and Tobago.
This was not obtained during 1977 and, at present, it is not clear whether
this will be available. Moreover, the reduced level of external capital
inflows, referred to in paragraph 14 above, meant that extraordinary external
financing was only US$45.0 million in 1977, compared to the projected level of
US$156.0 million. In addition, disbursements from prior commitments were
significantly lower, largely as a result of the lack of counterpart funds. To
meet this external inflows shortfall, the Government (i) reduced the current
account deficit from the projected level of US$110 million through the intens-
ification of import restrictions, (ii) received forward payments for sugar
from Tate & Lyle Company of UK of US$23 million, and (iii) received prepayments
of the bauxite levy of approximately US$40 million.
17.       Although these measures provided some short-term relief, they were
not sufficient to cover the shortfall on external capital inflows. Conse-
quently, there was a loss of reserves of approximately US$40 million.
Impact of Government's Policies on the Economic Situation During 1977
18.       Jamaica's balance of payments and fiscal situations generally
improved during 1977, reflecting both improved international demand for
bauxite/alumina and the effects of the policy measures which were introduced
to deal with the crisis.
19.       There was a dramatic improvement in the balance of payments during
the first half of 1977. Over this period, the country's trade balance deficit
was reduced to only US$4 million, compared to US$164 million for the corre-
sponding period in 1976. Merchandise exports totalled US$376.6 million,
compared with US$288.6 million during the first six months of 1977, an increase
of about 30%. The gains have been mainly due to the recovery (in terms of
both prices and production levels) in the bauxite/alumina sector. At the same
time, the import restrictions produced a decline of about 16% in merchandise
imports during the first half of the year, compared to the corresponding
period in 1976.

20.       For the year as a whole, it is estimated that the trade deficit
amounted to about US$20 million as import payments are typically higher for the
second half of the year in Jamaica. With respect to the rest of the current
account, tourism is estimated to have grossed US$70 million. These earnings,
however, were more than offset by interest payments and other factor and non-
factor service payments. On balance, the current account deficit for 1977
is estimated to have been US$70 million. This compares with the corresponding
figure for 1976 of US$295 million. The loss of international reserves was
about US$40 million, in sharp contrast to the loss in reserves of US$268
million during 1976.
21.       The situation has also improved on the fiscal side.  The actual
expenditures during the first half of the fiscal year were in line with
the budget. To ensure that expenditures remain within targeted amounts,
the Government adopted strict controls. All major outlays were and are being
audited at the Ministry of Finance, and monthly expenditure limits have been
assigned to various government ministries and departments. However, revenue
collections are estimated to have been slightly lower than earlier expectations,
primarily because of a revenue shortfall of J$50 million from the Exchange
Stabilization Fund. This shortfall reflected an under-estimation of accumu-
lated foreign liabilities which were settled at the exchange rate prevailing
prior to the April devaluation. This, together with the apparent nonavail-
ability, for the time being at least, of the anticipated US$49 million loan
from Trinidad and Tobago, will require further fiscal adjustments in the
future. On the whole, however, the Government's fiscal policies have been
accomplishing the objective of reducing the disequilibrium in public finances.
It is projected that the overall deficit of the Central Government will
decrease from 18.5% of GDP in the last fiscal year to about 9% in 1977/78.
22.       These accomplishments in the fiscal and balance of payments areas
have, however, been at a heavy cost in terms of output and employment. The
drastic reduction of imports has led to shortages of raw materials and inter-
mediate goods which have, in turn, led to the closure or reduced activity of
many distributing and manufacturing firms. There is a massive underutiliza-
tion of capacity in the productive sectors, in part because of external condi-
tions and in part because of the restriction on imports and domestic demand.



- 11 -
The bauxite/alumina sector is currently operating at about 75% of capacity.
In the manufacturing sector, capacity utilization, based on 1.5 shifts per
day, is about 33%. Unemployment rose to about 30% at the end of 1977, from
the already high level of 24% at the end of last year. Real GDP is estimated
to have declined by no less than 10%. Moreover, the impact of devaluation on
domestic prices has started to be felt. Whereas consumer prices increased by
about 10% during 1976 (and maintained the same rate during the first five
months of 1977), they increased by about 15% for 1977 as a whole.
Growth and Balance of Payments Prospects Beyond 1977
23.       The recent steps taken by the Government show its intention to
reduce the current account deficit to a level which can be sustained over
the longer run on the basis of normal levels and sources of external finance.
In the near term, the main source of better performance is expected to be on
the exports side. In the bauxite/alumina sector a return to the more normal
level of capacity utilization and good price prospects are projected to result
in export receipts from the sector of about US$915 million in 1980, compared
to about US$590 million in 1977, a nominal increase of about 55%. Sugar
receipts are expected to increase by about US$17 million between 1977 and
1980. In addition, the devaluation of the Jamaican dollar is expected to have
a significant effect on the country's other merchandise exports and tourism.
Growth in tourism will also depend on the maintenance of favorable economic
conditions in the North American countries and Jamaica's ability to improve
its image of security for the international tourist. On the whole, the export
of goods and nonfactor services are projected to increase from US$1,036
million in 1977 to US$1,703 in 1980, a nominal increase of about 64%.
24.       The level of economic activity in Jamaica is at present severely
restricted by the country's limited import capacity. The speed with which
recovery can be accomplished consequently will depend heavily upon the growth
of export earnings, the ability of the public sector to mobilize external
financing on appropriate terms and the trends in private capital flows. As
noted, the export prospects are generally favorable.
25.       Mobilizing the required levels of public sector capital inflows will
depend upon an improved capacity to prepare and implement projects and espe-
cially upon realizing the levels of public sector savings necessary as domestic
counterpart. Private capital movements will depend upon the Government's
ability to reestablish a climate of confidence which will stop, and eventually
reverse, recent private capital outflows.
26.       In the future external financing of public sector investments is
expected to rely upon medium- to long-term loans and credits with an average
maturity in excess of 10 years. (At the end of 1976, over 40% of the debt
outstanding and disbursed had an average maturity of under 10 years.) As a
result, debt service would not present an unmanageable problem. The estimated
total debt outstanding and disbursed at the end of August 1977 amounted to
approximately US$1.35 billion. Of this amount, about US$450 million was
direct public debt, US$400 million was government-guaranteed and the remaining



- 12 -
US$500 million was private nonguaranteed debt. The public debt service ratio,
which is currently estimated at 13.5%, is projected to increase further to
about 14% by 1978. Thereafter, however, it is expected to decline. Nonguaran-
teed private debt is not expected to change significantly over the next several
years. Provided Jamaica successfully carries out its economic stabilization
program and maintains its international competitiveness, it should be able to
manage its external indebtedness and be considered creditworthy for continued
Bank lending.
27.       Jamaica has the resources to enable it to both sustain significant
positive rates of real growth of per capita income and achieve a wider distri-
bution of the benefits of growth. Nevertheless, growth in real GDP during
1978 is projected to be low primarily because of the continuing constraint on
the capacity to import projected for the year. After 1978 a relatively rapid
recovery should be possible and subsequently it should be possible to maintain
real growth rates of 5 to 6 percent.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN JAMAICA 1/
28.       To date the Bank has made 16 loans in Jamaica totalling $182.4
million after cancellations. Of this amount about $81.5 million (44%) has
been for infrastructure investments in transportation, electric power, water
supply and sewerage; the remainder has gone into a program loan (16%), agri-
culture (13%), education (13%), sites and services (8%), and population and
nutrition (5%). There have so far been two IFC investments in Jamaica; a loan
in 1961 to a pre-mix concrete company and an equity/loan investment in 1968 in
a hotel project. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC
investments as of November 30, 1977 and notes on the execution of projects in
Jamaica. 2/
29.       Bank lending in Jamaica has been principally aimed at providing
transfers of long-term external capital to help finance the foreign exchange
component of high priority public sector investment projects. The Bank
program has been developed taking into account the role of other external
lending agencies--IDB, CIDA, ODM, USAID and the Caribbean Development Bank
(CDB)--and the Government's development strategy. Jamaica's program lending
1/   This part is substantially the same as the part on Bank Group operations
in Jamaica in the President's Report of November 21, 1977 for the Jamaica
Program Loan.
2/   Annex II does not contain the Program Loan which was approved by the
Bank's Executive Directors on December 13, 1977 and signed on December 16,
1977.



- 13 -
needs have been assessed in close coordination with IMF and after determining
the availability of other sources of external capital. Bank lending supports
government programs designed to increase production and employment, to achieve
a wider distribution of the benefits of economic growth, and to improve the
country's economic infrastructure where inadequate facilities are presently
constraining development. It is also an important objective of Bank lending
to strengthen the public sector institutions associated with Bank-financed
projects by supporting porting policies designed to improve the quality of
management, their operating procedures and finances.
30.       After a lull in Bank lending in 1972/73--resulting largely from
institutional constraints and slow project preparation--the pace of Bank opera-
tions picked up in FY74 and FY75, with an increased emphasis on projects in
the social sectors. Slow project preparation and, later in the period,
unsettled economic conditions reduced Bank lending to one loan each in FY76
and FY77. The current year lending program includes a $30 million Program
Loan approved in December 1/ and an $18 million loan for a proposed Sugar
Factory Rehabilitation project, which is being presented to the Executive
Directors at about the same time as the proposed loan.
31.       In the last several months, there have been some project implementa-
tion difficulties with several of the Bank-financed projects (see Annex II).
They have been caused by the deterioration in general economic conditions
(there has been a particular problem in maintaining subloan repayments in
intermediate credit operations), the limitations of counterpart availability
of local currency funds required for project execution arising from fiscal
restraints and general preoccupation of Jamaica's economic managers with the
economic crisis. However, the Government is aware of these problems and is
adopting measures directed toward solving them.
32.       In line with the Government's priorities and development strategy
Bank project lending will place increasing emphasis on projects to promote
exports, stimulate import substitution, increase employment and raise the
living standards for those in the lower economic strata. The Sugar Factory
Rehabilitation project in this year's lending programs addresses some of the
key problems in Jamaica's second largest export-earning industry. The proposed
loan for Small Scale Enterprise is in an advanced state of preparation and
will assist the emerging entrepreneur and small businessman. The project will
have significant employment and social benefits. In the coming years, the
Bank hopes to support the Government's efforts in the agricultural sector with
possible financing of projects for agricultural credit, irrigation, forestry
and rural development. Identification and preparation work has begun on all
of these projects.
1/   Jamaica has not yet met the conditions of disbursement which were estab-
lished under this loan. It is planned during the presentation of the two
new loans to the Executive Directors on Febuary 7 to make a statement
regarding the status of the Program Loan, taking into account the most
recent developments at that time, particularly with regard to the rela-
tions between Jamaica and the International Monetary Fund.



- 14 -
33.       In the social sectors, the Bank has been active in financing two
education projects, two population projects (the second of which contains an
important nutrition element) and a sites and services project. The proposed
loan would be the second operation of the Bank Group in Jamaica's power
sector. The first was a $22 million loan to JPSC in 1966 to finance genera-
tion and associated transmission and distribution for the greater Kingston
area. The Bank expects to continue to support programs to improve social and
physical infrastructure in Kingston and other urban areas. Looking further
ahead, it is expected that a third education project will be prepared for
possible Batik financing. The possible scope and content of the project,
however, has not yet been defined. The Bank's share of external public debt
outstanding and disbursed was about 8% in 1976 and its share of external public
debt service was about 6% in that year. It is estimated that these percent-
ages will not vary significantly during 1977.
PART III - SECTORAL BACKGROUND
Energy Resources
34.       The principal source of energy in Jamaica is imported petroleum,
which in 1974 accounted for about 99.4% of total commercial energy consump-
tion. Jamaica has no known oil, coal or natural gas deposits. Neither does
it have any geothermal resources and geological data indicate little likeli-
hood that they may exist in significant quantities. Hydroelectric power has
already been used to some extent (0.5% of commercial energy used in 1974) and
the Government commissioned Motor Columbus (Switzerland) to assess the extent
of further availability of hydro-energy. Their report indicates that hydro-
energy is not expected to play a significant role in Jamaica's future energy
supply due to the limited resources and the very high cost of developing them.
The smallest commercially available nuclear reactors are still too large for
the Jamaican market and therefore there is little likelihood of utilization
of this type of energy in the near future. Jamaica's dependence on imported
petroleum is thus likely to continue. The Jamaican Government is aware of
this and has taken steps to limit the growth of energy consumption.
The Role of the Sector in the Economy
35.       The provision of an adequate and reliable electric service is
essential for the development of the country's tourism, and the mining and
manufacturing industries which together provide employment for about 22% of
its nonagricultural labor force, account for about 30% of GDP, and contribute
about 70% of its foreign exchange earnings. Between 1965 and 1974, when the
real GNP grew at an average annual rate of about 4.5%, total energy and
electricity consumption grew at average rates of about 7.2%, and 12.0%
respectively. The resultant elasticities of Jamaica's energy and electricity
consumption with respect to the country's GNP growth rate (1.6 and 2.7
respectively) are comparable to those of other countries at similar stages of
development elsewhere in the region.



- 15 -
History of Bank Group Involvement with Sector
36.       The loan would be the second operation of the Bank Group with
Jamaica's power sector. The first, for US$22 million, was made to Jamaica
Public Service Company (JPSC) in 1966 to finance the foreign cost of approxi-
mately 120 MW of additional generating capacity and associated transmission
and distribution facilities for the greater Kingston area. The project was
completed substantially within the original schedule and cost estimates.
37.       Between 1970 and 1975 the sector underwent rapid changes. During
this period ownership of JPSC passed from private interests to the Government.
Personnel from Stone and Webster Corporation, which had been the controlling
shareholder, had been managing JPSC. Their departure after the Government
purchase of Stone and Webster's shares in 1971 created a vacuum in middle and
upper management. Between March 1974 and October 1975 JPSC did not have a
chief executive and top level decisions were exercised collectively by a
three-man office of the chief executive consisting of a part-time Chairman
of the Board, a Director of Finance and a Director of Operations. In the
interim, the company's financial condition deteriorated and the reliability
of electricity supply worsened. Because Government policy directives had
not yet crystallized, the various sector agencies were ineffective.
38.       The appointment of a full-time executive chairman, improvements in
JPSC's generation planning and tariff increases implemented in the last
three years, have been important steps towards strengthening JPSC and have
provided the necessary conditions to consider further Bank involvement in
the sector.
Sector Organization and Regulation
39.       According to Jamaican laws, the dominant sector institution should
be the Electricity Authority (EA), a Government entity established in 1958
with broad powers over the sector. However, the EA did not build the organi-
zation needed to discharge all of its responsibilities and limited itself
to acquiring the shares of JPSC, which in fact, is the dominant sector insti-
tution.
40.       Until 1975, regulation of JPSC's tariffs was the responsibility of
the Public Utilities Commission (PUC), a regulatory body established in 1966.
Following government acquisition of most of JPSC's shares, authority for
regulation of JPSC has been transferred to the Minister of Public Utilities,
Communications and Transport. This arrangement has worked satisfactorily.
41.       The newest sector institution is the Rural Electrification Prog-ramme
Limited (REP); a company with its own legal status, established by the Govern-
ment in June 1975 for the promotion, planning, engineering and construction
of rural electrification projects. Although REP is legally separate from
JPSC, it has in practice functioned as a department of JPSC. This arrange-
ment is desirable because of the small size of Jamaica's power market.



- 16 -
Electricity Consumption
42.       Electricity consumption in Jamaica is linked with essential eco-
nomic activity in the country. The mining, industrial and commercial sectors
account for over 75% of total electric energy consumed in any year. About
41% of total electric energy generated is by captive plants. This high
proportion of captive generation is mostly caused by a historic difference in
frequency and by the need of certain industries for process steam. The inabil-
ity of the public supply system to provide a high reliability of service has,
undoubtedly, also been a factor. It is expected that the improvements in the
reliability to be achieved by the program will enable JPSC to supply part of
the incremental needs of the operators of captive generation.
Access to Service
43.       It is estimated that about 73% of all Jamaican households are near
public electricity distribution lines and that about 35% are connected to the
electric power system. In Metropolitan Kingston and other urban areas, about
50% of all potential customers are connected whereas only about 11% of the
households in the rural areas (where 54% of the population of Jamaica lives)
are connected. It is believed that the proportion of households with electri-
city in the low-income areas of Kingston is only slightly higher than that of
the rural areas. Government policies now emphasize development of the rural
and low-income urban areas. The project will assist the implementation of
these policies by expanding electric service to low-income areas, thus comple-
menting other IBRD-assisted projects with considerable benefits to Jamaica's
urban poor (Loans 1146-JM and 1003-JM for water supply and sewerage and
sites and services).
Sector Investment Program
44.       The sector investment program to be carried out between 1978 and
1982 focuses on the following:
(a) improvement of the reliability of service to JPSC's
existing customers;
(b) expansion of service to low-income and rural areas of
the country;
(c) reduction of losses, unaccounted-for usage of electricity
and fuel consumption; and
(d) reduction of excess reserves in the generating system.
45.       JPSC's generating expansion program includes the start of construc-
tion of two 70-MW oil-fired steam units to be commissioned by 1984 and 1986.
Because of JPSC's past tendency to over-invest in generating facilities, JPSC
has agreed to review the timing of the construction of these units with the
Bank and not undertake any detailed engineering of the units until after the
Bank has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to offer its comments (Section
4.08, Loan Agreement). The distribution-transmission program includes the
addition of 140 MVAR of capacitors, about 70,000 meters and 2,100 circuit-
miles of lines, of which about 60% would be built under rural electrification
programs administered by REP which are expected to serve about 700 villages

with a population of about 250,000 and connect about 30,000 customers, of
which some 7,000 would receive financial assistance for house wiring.

Past Sector Investment
47.       JPSC's annual construction expenditures (excluding interest charged
to construction) during the last 5 years, ranged from a low of J$16.0 (US$12.8)
million in 1972 to a high of J$20.8 (US$16.6) million in 1973, totalling J$89.9
(US$71.9) million for the 1972-76 period. Aggregate investments during this
period were almost entirely financed by borrowings due to the fact that
Government equity investments contributions were offset by negative internal
cash generation.
Constraints on Sector Development
48.       The Government has already taken action to correct organizational
and financial deficiencies which slowed the development of the power sector
in 1970-74. It has appointed competent key personnel and instituted needed
rate increases. Further corrective actions would be needed to ensure orderly
development of the sector in the future. The most important of these - (i) the
need for the adoption of pricing policies to encourage efficient energy utiliza-
tion and (ii) the need for further strengthening of JPSC's management, finances
and technical capacity - are addressed by the program of which the project is
a part.



- 18 -
49.       Under their respective laws the EA and the PUC have broad responsi-
bilities in the sector which in some cases duplicate JPSC's. However it does
not appear that these duplications constrain sector development. The Govern-
ment has defined and implemented a policy which makes JPSC the principal sector
entity. Nevertheless, in order to provide an institutional structure which
would more clearly reflect the present division of responsibilities between
sector institutions, the Government has agreed that by December 31, 1979, it
would study the functions of the institutions operating in the sector for the
purpose of making recommendations to avoid any undesirable functional overlap-
ping. The Bank would be given an opportunity to comment on the recommendations
of the study before they are given effect (Section 3.03, Guarantee Agreement).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
The Borrower
50.       The Borrower would be JPSC, a corporation in which the Government has
a 98% interest, and which is the sole public-service supplier of electricity
in Jamaica.
Organization
51.       JPSC's corporate powers are vested in a Board of 11 members which in-
cludes an Executive Chairman. Day-to-day management of Company is under the
direction of the Executive Chairman, who is assisted by the Company's chief
financial and technical officers. JPSC's organization is common to many
public utilities and functions for a company of its size, operating in a
relatively small market.
52.       The organizational structure can, however, be improved as the
internal audit function is presently a functional responsibility under the
Chief Financial Officer instead of being directly under the responsibility of
the Executive Chairman. It was agreed during negotiations that JPSC would
establish by March 31, 1979, an Internal Audit Department directly responsible
to the Executive Chairman, to work under general terms of reference to be
determined in consultation with the Bank (Section 4.06, Loan Agreement).
Management and Staff
53.       JPSC management improved significantly during the last two years,
as a result of the appointment in October 1975, of its first full-time Chief
Executive since March 1974. Much of this improvement in JPSC's management can
be attributed to the sound organizational pattern and to the competence of the
Executive Chairman and chief technical and financial officers. It was agreed
during negotiations that JPSC would consult with the Bank on any proposed
changes in the top organizational structure, and/or in the persons filling



- 19 -
the positions cf chief executive, chief financial officer and chief technical
officer (Section 4.07b, Loan Agreement). The post of chief financial officer
is currently vacant and it was also agreed during negotiations that JPSC would
appoint, after consultation with the Bank, a suitable replacement not later
than June 30, 1978 (Section 4.07a, Loan Agreement).
54.       The deterioration in the quality of JPSC's service was due, inter
alia, to a lack of experienced middle-management, particularly in its operating,
engineering and planning departments. In order to improve its capabilities
in these activities JPSC agreed during negotiations to engage consultants to
assist it in improving its operating and maintenance practices in generation,
transmission and distribution and in training its staff (Section 3.02, Loan
Agreement).
55.       JPSC's payroll per employee is high by comparison with prevailing
wage levels in other activities. This has resulted from the pressure of wage
demands from its labor unions, most of which are affiliated with strong
nationwide unions. It is expected that the Government's new wages and incomes
policies would keep future salary increases in JPSC at reasonable levels.
Program and Project Objectives
56.       JPSC's service has been highly unreliable.  JPSC's attempts to
solve this problem by concentrating investments in generating units did not
improve service because of lack of adequate maintenance, less-than-optimum
specifications for the new generating units and a lack of capital expenditures
for transmission and distribution. The 1978 to 1982 construction program, of
which the project is a part, would enable JPSC to make more efficient use of
its existing generating units, reduce losses, meet future demands and reduce
outages. It would also assist JPSC in improving its operating and maintenance
practices and its pricing policies through the use of specialized consulting
services and through training of its staff. In line with the Government's
objectives of achieving greater equality in living standards between urban
and rural areas, and the emphasis it has placed on the development of low-
income urban areas, the project would, in part, make public service elec-
tricity available to low-income urban and rural customers.
Demand Forecast
57.       The average annual rate of growth of public-service electricity
consumption in Jamaica for the past 14 years has been about 10.3% while the
average consumption per customer has grown about 2.8% and the number of
customers has grown at about 7.3%. However, the rate of growth in both total
and per customer electricity consumption decreased sharply in 1973, 1974- and
1977. These reductions are thought to have been brought about at least in
part by high fuel costs and sharp increases in the base tariffs, plus a
general slowdown in the Jamaican economy.



- 20 -
58.       The sales forecast is based on statistical extrapolation and adjusted
after analysis of the expansion plans of the major customers and assumes that
during the project construction period, the power market will gradually recover
and approach its long-term average growth rate by 1982 in line with expecta-
tions of a reversal of the stagnation in the economy.
59.       The generation requirements have been forecast under the assumption
that JPSC would be able to reduce its losses and unaccounted-for usage of
electricity to an acceptable level. The energy requirements are expected to
be easily met during the project construction periods by the existing units.
During the same period, these units would also be capable of supplying the peak
demands which have been forecast from the energy requirements. Reserve require-
ments have been carefully studied by JPSC and its consultants and are consid-
ered adequate. The following table highlights the historical data and forecasts.

60.       JPSC agreed not to proceed with new works not included in the program
agreed with the Bank which would have a cost of over 2% of its gross fixed
assets, unless it has furnished the Bank a satisfactory economic and technical
justification, and evidence that it has a sound financial plan for the proposed
new investment (Section 5.08, Loan Agreement).
Project Concept
61.       The project includes JPSC's 1978-82 transmission-distribution
program with the exception of lines and substations which have already been
procured and items that can be acquired with other financing. The main items
included in the project are:
(a)  83 miles of 138 kV transmission lines;
(b)  58 miles of 69 kV transmission lines;
(c) the expansion of existing stations to accommodate the
proposed lines;



- 21 -
(d) installation of about 200 MVA of new transformer capacity
to provide adequate capacity for expected load growth;
(e) the equivalent of about two years of JPSC's distribution
program consisting of about: 45 MVA of distribution trans-
formers, 300 circuit-miles of 24 and 12 kV lines, 20,000
meters and 140 MVAR of capacitors;
(f) consultants' services for improvement of operating and
maintenance practices (about 150 m-m), tariff-structure
studies (about 10 m-m), and design and preparation of
contract documents and supervision of construction of
138 kV lines and substations (about 60 m-m); and
(g) training of JPSC personnel.
Least Cost Solution
62.       For most of the equipment and lines included in the program, such
as generating units, transformers or meters, no reasonable alternative exists.
Where alternatives do exist, for example, in routing of some lines and
location of substations, JPSC has selected or will select the least-cost
solution which is compatible with safety considerations. In the case of one
transmission line where there is some doubt as to the least-cost solution,
JPSC has agreed to complete studies leading to a determination whether it or
an alternative is the least-cost line (Section 5.10, Loan Agreement).
Execution
63.       JPSC's own staff will carry out the necessary engineering and
supervision of construction of most of the project. It was agreed during
negotiations that JPSC would engage consultants acceptable to the Bank for
the engineering and supervision of construction for all 138 kV lines and
substations as JPSC does not as yet have the in-house experience for this
type of work (Section 3.02, Loan Agreement). JPSC will request bids for
the supply of materials and equipment and for the construction of lines and
the installation of substations. JPSC personnel will install the distribu-
tion equipment. It is anticipated that all consultants will be foreign.
Procurement
64.       Goods and services (other than those of consultants) for the project
would be procured after international competitive bidding in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement except for about US$75,000 for special-
ized equipment, which would be purchased directly from the suppliers. Domestic
bidders whose items have a local value added of at least 20% would be entitled
in bid evaluation to a preference of 15% of c.i.f. price or the applicable
import duties, whichever is lower. There is some capacity for the domestic
manufacture of switches and wire, but not for other project items. It is
unlikely that awards to domestic manufacturers would exceed US$250,000.



- 22 -
Disbursement
65.       Disbursements from the loan account are expected to be made from
March 31, 1978 through September 30, 1982 for 100% of ex-factory cost of
locally manufactured items or 100% of foreign expenditures for:
(a) imported equipment and materials;
(b) contracts for installation and for erection of works;
(c) consultants' services; and
(d) the training program.
Retroactive financing of up to US$200,000 is proposed for consulting services
engaged during the second half of 1977 to expedite the installation of the 138
kV facilities included in the project.
Project Cost and Financing
66.       The total cost of the project has been estimated at US$36.1 (J$45.2)
million of which US$20.0 million is the foreign component. These costs were
estimated by JPSC and its consultants, Montreal Engineering of Canada, on the
basis of generally prevailing prices as of mid-1977 and were considered
reasonable by the Bank. The cost of consulting services has been estimated on
the basis of about US$6,000 per man-month. Physical contingencies have been
estimated to average about 14%. The price contingencies, which in the aggregate
are 36% of the base costs and physical contingencies, have been calculated on
the basis of assumed annual rates of inflation of 7.5% from 1977 to 1979 and
7% thereafter for foreign costs and 14% for 1977, 1978 and 1979 and 12% there-
after for local costs. The project cost estimate is summarized below:

/1   Includes proposed Canadian and IDB loans, a loan from the Royal
Bank of Jamaica and supplier credits.
68.       JPSC's projected financing plan includes Can$31 million from a
recently concluded Can$65 million loan agreement between the Governments
of Jamaica and Canada. The Jamaican Government has agreed to make these
funds available to JPSC. The Government has agreed to provide equity invest-
ments of J$31 (US$25) million during the 1978-82 period. During the same
period, JPSC would pay to the Government an estimated J$44 million in the form
of income taxes.
69.       The proposed US$20 million Bank loan would be made to JPSC for a
term of 17 years including 4 years of grace at the current Bank interest rate,
assumed for the purpose of financial projections to be 8% per year. The loan
would be guaranteed by the Government. It would cover all of the project's
foreign cost.
Earnings and Financial Position
70.       Principally because tariff increases were insufficient to cover
rapidly escalating costs, JPSC's financial performance deteriorated seriously
between 1972 and 1974. Financial performance improved in 1976 by virtue of
the combined effects of two increases in basic tariffs in October 1974 and
December 1975 (39% and 42%, respectively) and further monthly increases of 1%
between January 1976 and March 1977.
71.       JPSC's financial performance in 1977 was weakened by the introduc-
tion in Jamaica of a special foreign exchange rate for certain transactions.
This rate is applicable to all JPSC's transactions except the purchase of fuel.



- 24 -
As a direct result, JPSC's requirements for debt, service operations and main-
tenance increased by J$7 million. JPSC's internal cash generation from its
tariffs was unable to cover the increased debt service and it had to borrow
on relatively short terms to supplement its finances for the year. The Gov-
ernment has granted a 1-1/2% monthly cost of service adjustment to JPSC's
tariffs which, if maintained, should result in satisfactory performance in
1978.
72.       Agreements relating to the first power loan did not have any specific
earnings requirement. Instead the Bank relied on JPSC's license. The provi-
sions in the license proved inadequate and contributed to JPSC's past financial
difficulties. The current license allows for tariffs to be set to enable JPSC
to self-finance a reasonable portion of its investment program. The Govern-
ment agreed that it will allow JPSC's tariffs to be set so as to permit the
utility to earn a rate of return on its average revalued net fixed assets in
operation of at least 8% from 1978 through 1980 and of at least 8.5% thereafter
(Section 5.04(a), Loan Agreement and Section 2.01, Guarantee Agreement). This
provision would be consistent with the existing JPSC license and would enable
JPSC to self-finance a satisfactory percentage of its investment program. It
was also agreed that, as a condition of loan effectiveness, JPSC revalue its
assets as of December 1976, in accordance with methods acceptable to the Bank
(Section 8.01, Loan Agreement) and that it revalue its assets each year
thereafter (Section 5.05, Loan Agreement).
73.       JPSC's financial projections assume retention of all earnings other
than those needed for operations and payment of debt service, taxes, and pre-
ference share dividends. To ensure that JPSC retains adequate earnings in
the enterprise as assumed, the Government has agreed that in the event of
cash dividends being paid on ordinary shares during the construction period
of the project, it would reinvest such dividends in JPSC (Section 2.03,
Guarantee Agreement).
74.       Atlhough JPSC's receivables have been high in the past, management
has taken action to improve its billing and collection procedures, particularly
in increasing the number of customers billed monthly. JPSC has also agreed to
further strengthen its billing and collection procedures and study the feasi-
bility of billing more of its customers on a monthly basis (Section 5.09,
Loan Agreement).
Debt Limitations
75.       JPSC will have to ensure that the improvement in its financial
condition achieved in 1976 and projected for the program construction period
is not jeopardized by excessive reliance on borrowing. To that effect, JPSC
has agreed to limit at any time the sum of its overdrafts and demand loans
to no more than the equivalent of one-sixth of its cash requirements for all
operating expenses for the preceding 12 months (Section 5.07, Loan Agreement).
JPSC has also agreed not to incur any long-term debt without the Bank's con-
currence unless its internal cash generation covers not less than 1.5 times
the maximum debt service in any succeeding year (Section 5.06a, Loan Agreement).



- 25 -
76.       JPSC's financial condition is expected to recover from the 1977
reverses and improve steadily. Its debt service coverage ratio would increase
from about 0.6 in 1975 to about 2.3 in 1981 and its debt/equity ratio will
decline from 79/21 at year-end 1975 to about 53/47 in 1981 (25/75 if the
surplus from revaluations is included in equity) thus providing ample margin
for debt revaluation caused by exchange rate movements, as well as for addi-
tional borrowing. Its operating ratio would remain satisfactory.
77.       In the first power loan JPSC was required to issue debenture stock
as collateral for the loan. This arrangement was necessary to prevent private
debenture holders from having a prior claim on JPSC's assets. Because JPSC
still has senior securities outstanding it has agreed to make arrangements to
issue debenture stock as collateral for the proposed loan (Section 6.01, Loan
Agreement).
Internal Rate of Return
78.       The benefits of the five-year investment program, of which the
project is part, have been compared with its costs by equating the streams of
costs associated with the program through its assumed life of 30 years, with
the estimated benefits as measured by the forecast revenues from sales of
electricity at the retail level, using the tariffs in effect as of August
1977. The equalizing discount rate is 16%, which compares favorably with the
opportunity cost of capital for Jamaica (estimated to be 11%). This equalizing
rate probably understates the real economic rate of return of the program, as
the revenues from the sales of electricity may not fully measure some of the
benefits to society, such as the social benefits of residential and public
uses or the indirect benefits to industry derived from a reliable supply of
electricity.
79.       The result obtained is based on economic efficiency prices for all
inputs except labor and foreign exchange. The use of efficiency prices for
labor, which would be appropriate owing to Jamaican underemployment, would in-
crease the rate of return. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the rate of
return is not significantly affected by reasonable variations in the rate
of exchange, the cost of fuel, the rate of growth of demand, and the cost
of the program.
Benefits and Risks
80.       In contrast to the 1970-74 period when sector directives were
lacking, recent government policy decisions have clearly defined the objec-
tives and strategies for the development of Jamaica's power sector. The
continued development of the country's tourism and mining and manufacturing
industries, the efforts being made to achieve greater equality between urban
and rural areas through increased allocation of resources to rural areas, and
the emphasis placed on the development of the low-income urban areas, all
place special demands on electric power service. As the principal sector insti-
tution, the future performance of JPSC will greatly determine the achievement
of these objectives. The Government has taken several steps to strengthen
JPSC's top management, finances and technical capacities to enable it to



- 26 -
successfully carry out the responsibilities entrusted to it. Further steps
are necessary: JPSC's middle management needs to be trained; its technical
capacity needs to be expanded to improve the reliability of service, reduce
outages, losses and fuel consumption; its planning capacity needs to be
reinforced; and its capacity to mobilize financial resources needs to be
strengthened. In addition to helping JPSC supply the increasing demand at the
least cost, the proposed loan addresses itself to the resolution of these
problems. The principal objectives of the project have been incorporated
into the performance indicators which will be used to monitor the project's
progress. To ensure achievement of these objectives the Bank will maintain
a close dialogue with the Government and JPSC in the course of project super-
vision. The project does not pose any significant risks other than what
are normally associated with this type of undertaking.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
81.       The draft Loan Agreement between JPSC and the Bank, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between Jamaica and the Bank, and the Report of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of
Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
Special conditions of the project are listed in Annex III, Section III. An
additional condition of effectiveness is that JPSC shall have revalued its
assets as of December 31, 1976.
82.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
83.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   Projects in Execution
Ln. No. 727    Second Education Project; US$13.5 million of March 25, 1971;
Effective Date:  July 30, 1971; Closing Date:  December 31, 1978.
Project implementation is about three years behind appraisal
schedule due to a change in government, high turnover in project unit staff
and a lack of project implementation machinery. However, project implemen-
tation now seems satisfactory. As a result of initial delays in getting the
physical aspects of the project underway, the construction of schools will
not be completed before August 1978. Thus, the Closing Date, originally
December 31, 1975, has been extended to December 31, 1978. Due to sharp
increases in prices and wages in the construction sector since appraisal,
estimated project costs are about 100% greater than originally anticipated.
Counterpart funds are available, however, to allow project implementation to
proceed satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 899    Road Improvement and Maintenance Project; US$9.3 million of
June 1, 1973; Effective Date: August 31, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
After some initial delays and quality control problems, the
resurfacing and resealing program is proceeding satisfactorily. The technical
assistance and training programs of the consultants are also proceeding satis-
factorily. Total project costs are estimated to be about 50% above the
appraisal estimate due to increased costs of asphaltic overlay.

ANNEX II
Ln. No. 1003   Sites and Services Project; US$15.0 million of June 13, 1974;
Effective Date: September 9, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Delays in the project have been caused by initial start-up
problems, political violence and ineffective management controls. The project
is about 18 months behind schedule and costs are running 50% more than antici-
pated. The Government has recently agreed to adopt measures suggested by the
Bank to improve management systems and controls.
Ln. No. 1004   Second Agricultural Credit Project; US$5.5 million of
June 13, 1974; Effective Date: October 3, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
The worsening general economic situation and difficult drought
conditions over the last year have had a negative impact on the Borrower (the
Jamaica Development Bank) and the project. As a result arrears on principal
and interest payments have risen to unacceptable levels. The Bank has
suggested that the Jamaica Development Bank initiate an in-depth review of its
loan portfolio, which includes the reappraisal and rescheduling of loans and
the strengthening of collection activities.
Ln. No. 1032   Third Highway Project; US$13.5 million of July 26, 1974;
Effective Date: September 27, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Construction has been delayed due to adverse weather conditions,
redesign of some sections, unsuccessful tenders and labor problems. As a
result, it will be necessary to extend the project closing date by two years.
It is estimated that the project will have a cost overrun of 50%.
Ln. No. 1043   Airport Development Project; US$12.5 million of October 2, 1974;
Effective Date: March 14, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
All major contracts have now been awarded, but earlier delays
encountered during the design and award phases, mean that the project comple-
tion date will slip from 12 to 18 months, and the project cost will probably
exceed appraisal estimates by about 10%. Though execution of work in progress
has been slower than expected, the Government's tight fiscal situation makes
the revised construction schedule more acceptable. The Airports Authority's
aggressive management has improved this institution's financial position in
spite of reduced traffic and high inflation. Nonetheless, the Authority will
be unable to supply its contribution to the project financing plan. The short-
fall will be made up by the Government with help from the Venezuelan Investment
Fund.

Ln. No. 1146   Kingston Sewerage and Water Supply Project; IJS$15 million of
July 23, 1975; Effective Date: June 24, 1976;
Closing Date: September 30, 1979.
After some initial delays in establishing the project unit,
project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. Construction has begun
on all of the subcomponents of the water supply construction program and been
completed on one of them. The Government has approved a water rate increase
required by the loan.
Ln. No. 1284   Second Population Project; US$6.8 million of June 17, 1976;
Effective Date: August 30, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
A good start in the implementation of the project has been made.
Civil works and procurement are on schedule and project costs are within
appraisal estimates.
Ln. No. 1464   Rural Development Project; US$15 million of June 29, 1977;
Effective Date: October 14, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
The loan was declared effective on October 14, 1977 and project
implementation has only just begun.
