FISCAL YEAR

1/ The rate was moved from US$1.00 = J$1.25 to Us$1.00 = J$1.28 on October 21,
1977 and to US$1.00 = J$1.35 on January 13, 1978. Program costs and financial
projections have been calculated using the US$1.00 = J$1.25 rate; they were
not revised to reflect the current exchange rate because the effect of these
devaluations on project analysis is not significant as indicated by:
a) the increase in program cost (in J$) is less than 5% which has no
noticeable effect on the return on investment (paras. 6.05-6.09);
since the entire foreign exchange component of this investment
program is covered by external financing, the increase in program
cost (in J$) is offset by the increase (in J$) in foreign borrowing;
b) the increase in fuel costs will be passed on in full to the consumer
through the existing fuel clause (para. 6.02); and
c) the 6% increase in debt service (about J$10 million) will be more
than offset eventually by higher depreciation charges (about J$5
million) and higher net operating income (about J$7 million) resulting
from the agreed upon annual revaluation of assets.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
SECOND POWER PROJECT
CHAPTER 1
THE SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      The principal source of energy in Jamaica is petroleum, which
in 1974 accounted for about 99.4% of total commercial energy consumption.
Crude oil to service its 30,000 barrel/day oil refinery is imported from
Trinidad. Jamaica has no known oil reserves. No oil exploration activity
is either in progress or contemplated; and there are no indications that
domestic oil resources may be available.
1.02      Jamaica has no coal or natural gas deposits and geological data
indicate little likelihood that they may exist. Geothermal resources are
yet to be investigated, but there is little to encourage prospects of finding
significant geothermal fields. Jamaica has some hydroelectric potential
and hydroelectric power has been used to some extent (0.5% of commercial
energy consumed in 1974). The Government has commissioned Motor Columbus
(Switzerland) to assess the extent of further availability of hydro energy.
Their report indicates that hydroenergy is not expected to play a significant
role in Jamaica's future energy supply due to the limited resources and the
very high cost of their development. Nevertheless, the Jamaican Government
intends to commission feasibility studies for small run of the river plants,
which would reduce the use of fuel. The smallest commercially available
nuclear reactors are still too large for the Jamaican market and therefore
there is little likelihood of utilization of this type of energy in the near
future.
1.03      The Government has already taken some measures to limit the growth
of consumption of imported oil. For instance, the current prices for gasoline-
J$2.25 per imperial gallon (US$1.39 per US gal.) for premium and J$2.16 per
imperial gallon (US$1.33 per US gal.) for regular-which reflect a 60% increase
in January 1977, are comparable to prevailing prices elsewhere in the region,
as are prices of fuel oil used for power generation - J$12.05 (US$9.64) per
bbl. In the course of its economic work, the Bank will review the results of
these efforts and offer advice as required.
The Role of the Sector in the Economy
1.04      The provision of an adequate and reliable electric service is
essential for the development of the country's tourism and mining and manu-
facturing industries which together provide employment for about 22% of its



- 2 -
non-agricultural labor force, account for about 30% of Jamaica's GNP and
contribute about 70% of its foreign exchange earnings. The growth of the
energy sector in general, and its rapidly growing power subsector in parti-
cular has been faster than that of GNP. Between 1965 and 1974 when GNP grew
at an average annual rate of about 4.5%, total energy and electricity con-
sumption grew at average rates of about 7.2%, and 12.0% respectively. The
high elasticities of energy and electricity consumption with respect to
Jamaica's GNP growth rate, are not uncommon for developing countries.
Jamaica's recorded elasticities between 1965 and 1974 (1.6 for total commer-
cial energy and 2.7 for electricity) are comparable to those for countries in
the hemisphere at similar stages of development. For instance, over the same
period, the elasticities of energy and electric power consumption with respect
to GNP growth rate in Costa Rica were 2.3 and 2.5 respectively; in Panama 2.0
and 2.8; and in Trinidad 2.2 and 1.5.
History of Bank Group Involvement with Sector
1.05      The first Bank Group loan to Jamaica's power sector (454-JM) for
US$22 million, was made to the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPSC) in 1966,
then under private control, to finance the foreign cost of approximately
99 MW of oil-fired steam generating capacity, 22 MW of diesel peaking plant,
and associated transmission and distribution facilities for the greater
Kingston area. The project was completed in 1972, substantially within the
original schedules and cost estimates, although completion of the transmission
and distribution components was delayed about six months because of JPSC's
financial difficulties.
1.06      Between 1970 and 1975, the sector underwent rapid changes.  During
this period ownership of JPSC passed from private interests to the Government.
Personnel from Stone and Webster Corporation (USA), which had been the control-
ling shareholder, had been managing JPSC. Their departure after the Govern-
ment purchase of Stone and Webster's shares in 1971 created a vacuum in middle
and upper management; between March 1974 and October 1975, JPSC did not have a
Chief Executive and top level decisions were exercised collectively by a
three-man office of the Chief Executive consisting of a part time Chairman of
the Board, a Director of Finance and a Director of Operations. In the interim
the company's financial condition deteriorated and the reliability of electri-
city supply worsened. Government policy directives had not crystallized and
as a result the actions of the various sector regulatory and operating agencies
were ineffective. The appointment of a full-time Executive Chairman in
October 1975, improvements in JPSC's generation planning (see para. 4.03), and
tariff increases implemented in 1974, '75 and '76 have been important steps
towards strengthening JPSC and have provided the necessary conditions to
consider further Bank involvement in the sector.
1.07      The loan, which is the second operation of the Bank Group with the
sector, will seek further improvements by including funds for technical
assistance to (a) improve JPSC's generation, operating and maintenance
practices; (b) study the structure of electricity tariffs; and (c) train
JPSC's personnel. The loan agreements also include covenants intended to
ensure continued improvements in JPSC's financial condition.



- 3-
Sector Organization and Regulation
1.08      According to Jamaican laws, the dominant sector institution should
be the Electricity Authority, a government entity established in 1958 to:
(a) propose the establishment of electric power systems capable
of meeting the needs of the country;
(b) promote and encourage the development and use of electricity;
(c) acquire shares of public suppliers of electricity; and
(d) generate, distribute and sell electric power and energy.
Despite its broad powers, the Electricity Authority did not build the
organization needed to discharge all of its responsibilities; instead it
limited itself to acquiring the shares of JPSC, which in fact, is the dominant
sector institution.
1.09      The newest sector institution is the Rural Electrification Programme
Limited (REP), a company established by the Government in June 1975, with
nation-wide responsibility for the promotion, planning, engineering and
construction of rural electrification projects (see para. 1.16). REP is
presently in charge of construction of a rural electrification project
financed in part by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).
1.10      Until 1975 regulation of the power industry (i.e. regulation of
JPSC) was the responsibility of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC),
a regulatory body established in 1966 by an act that bears its name. The
PUC's responsibilities were to:
(a) prescribe standards of utility services;
(b) determine the rates which may be charged in respect of
utility services; and
(c) direct public utilities to put into effect development
programs as required.
With respect of JPSC, the PUC's function consisted essentially of regulating
the rates it charged consumers. Following its acquisition of most of JPSC's
shares, the Government decided to reorganize its regulatory policies in the
power sector. Under the current JPSC licence (as amended in April 1977),
authority for its regulation has been vested in the Minister of Public
Utilities, Communications and Transport. This arrangement has worked
satisfactorily.

Electricity ConsLnlption
1.11      Electricity consumption in Jamaica is linked with essential economic
activity in the country. In 1976, the mining, industrial and commercial
sectors which constituted approximately 59% of GDP accounted for about 75% of
total electric energy consumption. Below is a summary of electricity consump-
tion in 1976.
Public Service    Captive Plants         Total
(Actual)         (Estimated)
GWh        %       GWh         X       GWh      X

Commercial & Industrial    639.8        57       93.8       12      733.6    39

Others                       134.4      12        -                 134.4      7
Total                 1120.2      100     774.6      100      1894.8   100
59%                41%                100%
Existing Facilities
1.12      Total installed generating capacity as of the end of 1976 was
about 705 MW, of which approximately 471 MW (67%) were part of the public
service system owned by JPSC. The remainder were captive plants owned
principally by aluminum, sugar and cement industries. Of the electric energy
generated by JPSC, approximately 83% was by steam plants, 5% by gas turbines
and 4% by diesel plants and only 8% by hydro plants. Fuel costs are thus a
very large component of JPSC's operating costs (approximately 53% in 1976).
1.13      JPSC's transmission system consists of about 480 miles of 138 kV,
69 kV, and 33 kV lines. There are about 3,200 miles of primary distribution
lines at voltages of 24 kV and below. JPSC's transmission and distribution
system is inadequate to meet service requirements (see para. 4.01). The
proposed program addresses itself to assisting JPSC solve this problem (see
paras. 4.04-4.06).
1.14      The high proportion of captive generation is caused by a historic
difference in frequency (most captive generating plants operate at 60 hertz
while the public system operates at 50 hertz) and by certain industries'
need for process steam. The inability of the public supply system to provide
a highly reliable service has, undoubtedly also been a factor. It is expected
that the improvements in the reliability to be achieved by the program will
enable JPSC to supply part of the incremental needs of these industries thus
reducing the need for installation of costly captive generating plants in the
future.



-5-
Access to Service
1.15      Compared to countries at similar stages of "evelc- men- access
to electricity service in Jamaica as a whole, is good.  It  s ettimated that
about 73% of all Jamaican households have access to public electricity suppTh'
by virtue of being within 100 meters of existing lines and about 35% are
connected to the electric power system.  However, the distribution of e'or-
tricity service between the high income sections of the urban areas on the
one hand and the urban poor and rural areas on the other, is uneven. -a
Metropolitan Kingston and other urban areas about 50% of all potentia'
customers are connected whereas only about 11% of the rural households are
connected.  Data on availability of electric service in t ' low income areas
of Kingston is not available; however, it is believed that the percentage of
households with electricity supply in these areas is only slightly higher than
in the rural areas. This imbalance in the public electricity supply has been
primarily caused by the pattern of economic development in the past and the
lack of specific programs with income distributional objectives. Government
policies now emphasize development of the rural and low income urban areas.
The project will assist the implementation of these policies by increasing the
connection in low income areas. In this respect the project will complement
other IBRD assisted projects with considerable benefits to the urban poor.
(Loans 1146-JM and 1003-JM for water supply and sites and services res-
pectively). The rural electrification projects will also be instrumental in
achieving balanced urban/rural access to electricity supply.
Rural Electrification
1.16      About 54% of Jamaica's population is rural.  Prior to the estab-
lishment of the REP there had been no comprehensive rural electrification
policy. JPSC's 1966 license obligated it to extend service to rural areas but
only if its financial condition was not impaired by so doing. Given JPSC's
financial history, it is not surprising that it made little investment in
rural electrification. In 1975, only about 51% of the rural population had
access to the public electricity supply system. In line with the Government's
policy of emphasizing rural development, REP was established to undertake
construction of electric distribution lines in the rural areas so as to
increase the percentage of connections in these areas. REP is presently
administering two rural electrification programs. The first, to be completed
in 1977, is a Government financed project to construct approximately 205 miles
of distribution lines serving about 150 villages and a population of 25,000
with an estimated minimum of 3000 new customers. The second is a US$13.7
million project being financed jointly by IDB (about US$9.2 million partici-
pation) and the Government (US$4.5 million participation). This project will
cover about 200 miles of distribution extensions, servicing about 160 villages
with a population of about 50,000. Over 7,000 more connections are to be made
by the end of this project in 1979. Both rural electrification projects
include funds for financial assistance for house wiring to be recovered
through consumers' bills over a five year period. About 70% of the new
customers are expected to benefit from this program. After completion of this
program, REP expects to continue with other programs and connect 20,000
additional customers by 1982 (see para. 4.07).



- 6 -
1.17      Although REP was conceived as a distinct legal and organizational
entity, it has, in practice functioned as a department of JPSC as evidenced
by the following:
(a) JPSC's executive chairman serves also as executive
chairman of REP;
(b) REP's General Manager is also the manager for commercial
development at JPSC;
(c) Some of REP's financial and administrative functions are
undertaken on its behalf by JPSC personnel seconded to it;
(d) JPSC assumes servicing of the debt incurred to build the
rural electrification lines and will assume operation of the
lines after their construction.
This arrangement is practical because of the small size of Jamaica's power
market.
Constraints on Sector Development
1.18      The Government has already taken action to correct certain deficien-
cies which slowed the development of the power sector in 1970-74 (paras. 2.03
and 2.06). Further corrective action would be needed to ensure orderly devel-
opment of the sector in the future. In view of the continuing importance
of the power sector, the Jamaican authorities should pay particular attention
to the formulation of comprehensive policies. This necessitates an assessment
of the pattern of utilization of electric energy and adoption of mechanisms -
such as pricing policies - to promote its efficient utilization. JPSC's
management, its finances and its technical capacity should be further streng-
thened. These problems are addressed by the program of which the
project is a part.
1.19      Even though under their respective laws, the Electricity Authority
and the PUC have broad responsibilities in the sector which, in some cases,
duplicate JPSC's responsibilities, it does not appear that these duplications
constrain sector development. The government has defined and implemented a
policy which makes JPSC the principal sector entity. Nevertheless, in order
to provide an institutional framework which would more clearly reflect the
present division of responsibilities between sector institutions, the Govern-
ment has agreed to study the existing relationships between them by December 31,
1979 and consult with the Bank before making any changes.

CHAPTER 2
THE BORROWER
2.01      The Borrower is the Jamaica Public Service Co. Ltd. (JPSC), a
corporation in which the Government has a 98% interest, and which is the sole
public service supplier of electricity in Jamaica. JPSC was formerly owned by
private interests, mainly US, British and Canadian, and operated under the
effective control of Stone & Webster (through a 19.6% participation and
management and consultant contracts). In 1971, the Electricity Authority
(para. 1.08) purchased Stone and Webster's controlling interest and by the end
of 1974, had almost complete ownership (98%). The remaining 2% is still in
the hands of about 3,000 private individuals who have not yet responded to the
Government's offer to buy all outstanding shares. These remaining shares,
which are in numerous small lots, are not expected to be acquired by the
Government because the owners cannot be located; the Government has however
kept open its proposal and is willing to negotiate the purchase of all
outstanding shares.
Organizational Structure
2.02      JPSC's corporate powers are vested in a Board of 11 members.  Govern-
ment appointees include representatives of the Government, the industrial and
financial sectors, and the consumers; two seats (presently vacant) are pro-
vided for workers' representatives under a worker participation program
presently being discussed with the Unions. The Board meets normally once a
month, generally to act on corporate policy matters; day-to-day operations
are dealt with by its Executive Chairman and JPSC's chief financial and
technical officers; the latter is, at the present time, also a member of the
Board.
2.03      The departure of Stone & Webster's expatriate personnel, which
accompanied government acquisition of control over JP'SC created a vacuum in
the upper and middle levels of the company's management and might have
affected its organizational structure. As a result of the difficulties in
finding an appropriate full-time chief executive for the company, the Govern-
ment considered dividing JPSC into two autonomous branches (financial, commer-
cial and distribution activities in one and generation, transmission and
technical planning in the other) However, after consultation with the Bank,
the Government appointed a full-time Executive Chairman in October 1975, which
has resulted in a definite improvement in JPSC's management.
2.04      The present organizational structure shown in Figure 2.1, has so
far proven adequate for an efficient development of the company. In addition
to the chief financial and technical officers the corporate secretary and
general managers for industrial and public relations and commercial develop-
ment report directly to the Executive Chairman. Operations are partially
decentralized for distribution (regional divisions) while overall responsi-
bility for (i) production, (ii) engineering and technical planning and (iii)
maintenance, are centralized in three different departments, based in the



-8-
headquarters. All financial and administrative services are fully centralized.
This type of organization is common to many public utilities and functions
well for a company of the size of JPSC operating in a relatively small market.
2.05      The organizational structure could be further improved.  The
internal audit function presently is a line responsibility under the chief
financial officer. This function would be better performed if it were a staff
responsibility directly under the Executive Chairman as is the case in most
companies. This arrangement would provide a greater degree of independence to
the internal auditor. JPSC has therefore agreed, to establish, by March 31,
1979, an Internal Audit Department, directly responsible to the Executive
Chairman, to work under general terms of reference to be determined in con-
sultation with the Bank.
Management and Staff
2.06      JPSC's management improved significantly during the last two years,
as a result of the appointment of its first full-time Chief Executive since
1974 (this position had been vacant between March 1974 and October 1975, thus
impairing substantially the decision-making process in the company). Much
of this improvement in JPSC's management can be attributed to the top
organizational structure and to the competence of the Executive Chairman and
the chief technical and financial officers. The latter left the company in
early 1977; JPSC is yet to find a suitable replacement. Because the current
top organizational structure and the appointments of qualified executive
chairman and chief financial and technical officers are important for the
continued sound management and administrative improvements of the company,
JPSC and the Government agreed to appoint after consultation with the Bank,
a suitable chief financial officer not later than June 30, 1978; and to con-
sult with the Bank before making any changes in the three top positions or the
persons filling them.
2.07      After the departure of Stone & Webster's expatriate personnel, JPSC
had to fill key vacancies with inexperienced engineers, leading to severe
weaknesses in its engineering and planning departments. These weaknesses have
resulted in inadequate programming of its investments and operating and main-
tenance practices. In order to improve its capabilities in these activities,
JPSC has agreed to engage-consultants to assist it in improving its operating
and maintenance practices in generation and in transmission-distribution.
During the project construction period Jamaican engineers, who would be
assigned to work under the direction of the consultants, are expected to gain
enough operating experience to strengthen system planning.
Staff Relations
2.08      JPSC's unions have a strong bargaining power, which is not uncommon
for Jamaica as trade unions play a significant role in industrial, commercial
and government organizations in the country. Out of JPSC's 1690 employees
only about 150 (mostly middle and top management) are not unionized; the rest



- 9 -
of the staff are affiliated with one of four nation-wide unions, the largcst
two of which play active roles in Jamaica's two principal political parties.
The company has been plagued in recent years by frequent industrial disputes
and, in the face of recent high domestic inflation, had to concede steep
wage increases (the latest settlement, in September 1975, resulted in a pay
raise of 50% in the first year and up to 15% in the second). Reflecting this
situation, JPSC's annual payroll averages about J$7,500 (US$6,000) per
employee, which is high in comparison with Jamaica's per capita income.
It is, however expected that the government's new incomes and wage t ' iicies
would keep future salary increases at JPSC within reasonable levels.
Training
2.09      JPSC has spent about J$1.5 (US$1.2) million over the past six
years in staff training (90% of it being foreign costs); most of the total
cost (80%) was devoted to training of generating plant personnel while only
4% went to transmission lines maintenance training. Overall, JPSC's training
expenses over the past six years represented J$160 (US$128) per employee per
year, which is adequate, although past training has not been fully effective.
2.10      To help JPSC strengthen its future training program, the Bank loan
includes the financing of JPSC's foreign training costs between 1978 and 1982,
estimated at about US$480,000. JPSC has agreed to prepare by December 31,
1979, with the assistance of consultants to be engaged (para. 2.07), a
detailed program, satisfactory to the Bank which would emphasize maintenance
and planning.
Management Systems
2.11      Financial planning and budgeting has been significantly improved
in recent years and a comprehensive budget is now produced annually. The
Controller's Department also produces monthly financial reports but issuing
delays are long (up to 6 months for detailed reports).
2.12      Since 1970 JPSC has been using a computer essentially for billings
and payroll; efforts are being made by the programming staff to computerize
other tasks such as financial planning and budgeting, inventory control
and some engineering applications (e.g. transformer load management). These
efforts are to be completed by 1981 and are expected to result in timely
reports. JPSC has in-house programming capabilities for most of the task,
although it employs outside consultants when necessary.
Audit
2.13      The accounts of the company are maintained in accordance with
general regulations prescribed for public utilities by the Federal Power
Commission of the United States, and audited by qualified external auditors
(Price Waterhouse and Co.). JPSC has agreed to continue to appoint
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and to send its audited financial
statements to the Bank within four months of the end of each fiscal year.

Billings and Collections
2.14      Billings are made in bimonthly cycles for all customers except for
a few large ones, who are billed monthly. Collection is made through 100 bank
branches, regional division offices, a few collection agents (shops, etc.),
and mail. Because of the difficulties inherent in the present system of
bimonthly billings as well as in collection in low-income residential areas
(particularly in times of economic recession), JPSC's receivables have been
high in the past years: In 1974 and 1975, receivables represented
respectively 79 and 83 days of billings. JPSC's management has taken action
to improve its billing and collection procedures particularly in increasing
the number of consumers who are billed monthly; the company's receivables
outstanding declined to the equivalent of 73 days of billings at end of 1976.
JPSC has agreed to continue its best efforts to reduce receivables in line
with the targets shown in Table 5.8. These targets will be closely monitored
during project supervision. It has agreed to conduct a study, to be completed
by September 30, 1978, regarding the feasibility of billing all its clients
on a monthly basis. JPSC has further agreed that it will discuss the results
of such a study with the Bank no later than December 31, 1978 and if found
feasible, to carry out a program to increase the number of customers with
monthly billing.
Insurance
2.15      JPSC's assets have been insured against most common risks, such as
boiler explosion and fire, in accordance with common public utility practices.

CHAPTER 3
THE MARKET AND THE MEANS TO MEET IT
Historical Market
3.01      The average annual rate of growth of public-service electricity
consumption in Jamaica for the past fourteen years has been about 10.3% while
the average consumption per customer has grown about 2.8% and the number of
customers has been growing at about 7.3%. However, as may be seen in Table
3.1, the rate of growth in both total and per customer electricity consumption
decreased sharply in 1973 and 1974 and is expected to again decrease in 1977.
These reductions are thought to have been brought about by high fuel costs and
sharp increases in the base tariffs, plus a general slowdown in the Jamaican
economy.
The Forecast
3.02      The energy sales forecast (see table 3.2) is based on past trends
and assumes that during the project construction period, the power market
will gradually recover and approach its long-term average growth rate after
1982, in line with expectations of a reversal of the stagnation in the economy.
The average rate of growth from 1977 to 1982 is forecast to be about 6.7% p.a.
3.03      The growth in the number of customers has been practically unaffected by
the economic conditions prevailing since 1973, particularly in the residential
sector. The forecast assumes a continuation of the rapid growth in the number
of connections, which would result in an increase in the relative importance
of residential sales from 28% tin 1970, 30% in 1975 and 31% in 1976 to a
forecast 34% by the end of the project construction period (1982) and 39% by
1985.  The 1977-82 construction program, of which the project is part,
would be instrumental in increasing both the absolute and relative number of
households served with public service electricity (from 154,600 in 1976 or 35%
of the estimated number of households in the country, to an expected 243,000
or about 52% of the forecast households by the end of 1982). It is not
feasible to make accurate projections as to the number of low income customers
to be connected through the program. However, it may be noted that a large
proportion of the new customers are expected to be of low income as the
distribution program is concentrated in those rural and urban areas presently
without adequate coverage. This notwithstanding, it is expected that the
average use per residential customer will once again increase, as it has
generally done in the past 14 years, principally because of present low
ownership of electrical appliances. For instance, it has been esLimaLed, on
the basis of limited surveys, that only about 35-40% of the consumers own
refrigerators and television sets. The usage per residential customer fore-
cast for 1982, 2200 kWh p.a., is still expected to be lower than those of
comparable countries in the region such as Costa Rica (2912 in 1975), Panama
(2320 in 1975), and Trinidad (2960 in 1976).



- 13 -
The Energy and Capacity Balance
3.04      The electricity generation requirements have been forecast under the
assumption that JPSC would be able to reduce its losses and unaccounted-for
usage of electricity from 13.6% in 1976 to 11% by 1982. Station use (5.7%
of gross generation in 1976) is high due to the type of auxiliary equipment
presently in use in the plants but it would be unrealistic to assume a
significant reduction in this usage as JPSC's existing plants are forecast
to be used for several years into the future. Because of the absence of
indigenous energy resources (paras. 1.01-1.02) and its limited power market
Jamaica would, for the foreseeable future, rely almost exclusively on existing
and proposed conventional oil-fired plants. These plants are capable of
supplying the peak demands as envisaged (Table 3.2). They are also capable of
operating at high plant factors and can therefore easily meet the forecast
energy requirements. The proposed reserves at the time of the system peak
have been carefully studied by JPSC and its consultants (see para. 4.03) and
are adequate.
The Transmission and Distribution Facilities
3.05      Expansion of these facilities (paras. 4.04-4.07) would be
commensurate with the expected growth rate of sales, the lack of past invest-
ments, the inadequate maintenance of existing facilities, the dispersion of
loads and the expected improvement in the system power factor.

CHAPTER 4
PROGRAM AND PROJECT
Background and Objectives
4.01      JPSC's service to the public has been highly unreliable due to
an unacceptable number of outages in all parts of its power system.    SC
initially attempted to solve this problem by compensating for operating and
maintenance deficiencies with a concentration of investment in generating
units resulting in excess generating capacity (see table in para. 4.03).
Notwithstanding this, the system remained unreliable due to inadequate main-
tenance, less-than-optimum specifications for the new generating units and too
little capital expenditures for transmission and distribution. Within the
past three years, JPSC has upgraded its maintenance and tried to implement
needed additions to its transmission and distribution systems and has thereby
achieved a moderate improvement in its service.
4.02      The 1978 to 1982 construction program is expected to further assist
JPSC in its efforts to improve the quality of its service. It will provide
balance between the installed capacity in generating plants and the rest of
the system and it will enable JPSC to make more efficient use of existing
generating units, reduce losses and meet future demands throughout the
country. The program would also assist JPSC in improving its operating
and maintenance practices and its pricing policies through the use of spe-
cialized consulting services and through training of its staff. The program
would also be instrumental in making public service electricity available to
low-income and rural customers (para. 3.03).
Generation
4.03      JPSC's generation expansion program through 1982 has been carefully
studied by JPSC and its consultants (Montreal Engineering - Canada) and has
been planned to provide reserve margins consistent with sound utility practices.
The progam thus departs significantly from past installation policies. The
table below compares the forecast reserve margins obtained in the generating
system following these proposed installations with the reserve margins main-
tained in the past.  Tne 5-year generation program includes the start of
construction of one 70 MW oil-fired steam unit at Hunt's Bay (see map) to be
commissioned by 1984 and of a similar unit at Old Harbour now scheduled to be
commissioned by 1986. JPSC has agreed to give the Bank a reasonable oppor-
tunity for commenting on the timing of these units, in the light of updated
load forecasts and JPSC's consultants findings on the maintenance-improvement
program, before undertakirng their detailed engineering.

In order to ensure that JPSC will not revert to its past policy of over-
installation, it should agree not to undertake any expansion project departing
from the agreed-upon program which exceeds 2% of its gross revalued fixed
assets in operation, unless it can furnish evidence satisfactory to the Bank
that such a project is adequatelv justified on technical and economic
considerations and that it has an adequate financial plan.
Transmission
4.04      The proposed expansion nlan for transmission lines and substations,
which includes about 113 miles of 138 kV lines, 63 miles of 69 kV lines
and about 290 MVA of 138 kV and 69 kV transformers, provides the foundation
for a more reliable service to Jamaica, particularly to the northeast of the
island. A second objective to be met by this program is to allow greater
utilization of the most efficient generating units of the system by improving
the tie-lines between stations. The program also permits meeting load growths
beyond 1981 by providing the backbone of a 138 kV transmission system which,
when the need arises, can easily be expanded to serve these loads.
4.05      The most important lines and substations included in the program
are the following (see map for locations):
138 kV lines:  Kendal-Duncans (30 miles)
Duncans - Bellevue (43 miles)
Duncans - Bogue (40 miles)
69 kV lines:  Port Antonio - Oracabessa (46 miles)
Substations:   Bogue (138 kV) 25 MVA
Hunts Bay (69 kV) 90 MVA
Bellevue (138 kV) 25 MVA

Distribution
4.06      The distribution expansion program to be carried out during the
period focuses on the following:
(a) improvement of the reliability of service to
existing customers;
(b) expansion of service to low-income and rural areas of
the country;
(c) reduction of losses, unaccounted-for usage of electricity
and fuel consumption.
Accordingly, the program includes the addition of about 2100 circuit-miles
of lines below 69 kV, which represent about 64% of the total of such lines
installed by the end of 1976, 227 MVA in distribution transformers (an increase
of 27%), 140 MVAR of capacitors (about 165% of the existing ones) and about
70,000 meters (about 39% of the existing ones).
4.07      The distribution program includes the on-going rural electrification
projects being carried out with financial assistance from the Government
and IDB. These projects envisage the installation of 420 circuit-miles of
lines and the connection of about 10,000 new customers by the end of 1978,
which are realistic goals. Upon completion of these projects, JPSC expects to
build an additional 930 circuit-miles of lines and connect about 20,000
customers between 1979 and 1982.

4.09      The base costs were estimated by JPSC and Montreal Engineering
(Canada) on the basis of generally prevailing prices as of mid-1977 and were
considered reasonable by the Bank. The cost of consulting services has been
estimated on the basis of about US$6,000 per man-month, excluding subsistence
and travel expenses. Physical contingencies have been estimated as 10 to 15%
of the base estimates of the individual components of the program, depending
on the status of the engineering; the overall average is about 14%. The price
contingencies have been calculated on the basis of assumed annual rates of
inflation of 7.5% from 1977 to 1979 and 7% thereafter for foreign costs and
14% for 1977 through 1979, and 12% thereafter for local costs.
The Project
4.10      The project includes the full transmission-distribution program
through mid 1982 with the exception of the ongoing parts and of those items
that can be acquired at competitive prices in Canada through the Canadian
loan (see para. 5.14). The project thus includes the following items:
(a) Transmission lines:
(i)  Duncans-Bogue, 138 kV transmission line (40 miles)
(ii)  Duncans-Bellevue, 138 kV transmission line (43 miles)
or Tredegar-Bellevue (25 miles). (see para. 6.04).
(iii) Greenwich Road - Cane River, 69 kV transmission
line (12 miles)
(iv)  Oracabessa-Annotto Bay, 69 kV transmission line (22 miles)
(v)  Annotto Bay-Port Antonio, 69 kV transmission line (24 miles)
(b) Substations:
(i)  The expansion of the existing or under construction
stations at Cane River, Bogue and Duncans (or Tredegar)
to accommodate the proposed lines;
(ii)  installation of 90 MVA of 69-24 kV transformer capacity
at Hunts Bay to provide for adequate capacity in Kingston;
(iii) installation of 25 MVA, 138-69 kV at Bogue and Bellevue;
12.5 MVA, 69-24 kV at Parnassus, Duhaney, Duncans, Annotto
Bay, Bogue, Bellevue and Spur Tree and 6.25 MVA, 69-24 KV
at Port Antonio to provide adequate capacity for
expected load growth in these areas;
(c) The equivalent of about two years of JPSC's distribution program,
consisting of about:
(i) 45 MVA of distribution transformers, 5 to 50 kVA each;
(ii) 300 circuit-miles of 24 and 12 kV lines;



- 20 -
(iii) 20,000 kWh meters; and
(iv) 140 MVAR of capacitors.
(d) Consultants' services for:
(i) improvement of operating and maintenance practices in
distribution and transmission (about 80 m-m);
(ii)  improvement of operating and maintenance practices in
generating stations (about 70 m-m);
(iii)  tariff-structure studies (about 10 m-m); and
(iv)  design and preparation of contract documents and
supervision of construction of 138 kV lines and
substations (about 60 m-m).
(e)  Training of JPSC personnel.
Project Cost Estimate
4.11      The project cost estimate is summarized in the table below; the
detailed estimate and the annual expenditures appear in Table 4.1.

These costs have been calculated on the same basis as those for the complete
program (para. 4.09).
Implementation
4.12      JPSC's own staff will carry out the necessary engineering and
supervision of construction for most of the project. This is acceptable as



- 21 -
JPSC has proven experience in similar works completed recently or still under
construction. JPSC has agreed to engage consultants acceptable to the
Bank for assisting it in the engineering and supervision of construction for
all 138 kV lines and substations as JPSC does not as yet have the in-house
experience for this type of work. JPSC personnel would install the distri-
bution equipment and build short distribution extensions. Contractors would
install substations and build all 138 and 69 kV lines and major distribution
lines.
4.13      The project implementation schedule envisages completion by March 31,
1982, which is reasonable.  The detailed schedule (Table 4.2) will be used
to monitor progress during the project construction period.
Procurement
4.14      Procurement of goods and services, other than those of consultants,
for the project would be made following international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement except for about
US$75,000 for specialized equipment for substations, which for compatibility
with existing equipment, would be purchased directly from the suppliers.
Local manufacturers are expected to supply goods for the project with an
aggregate cost not exceeding US$250,000. Their bids, if containing components
manufactured in Jamaica with at least 20% value added, will be given a margin
of preference of 15% or the applicable customs duties, whichever is the lower.
Purchases under the Canadian loan (para. 5.14) would be through competitive
bidding limited to Canadian suppliers. Procurement for the rural electrifi-
cation program would be under competitive rules agreed upon between the
Jamaican Government and IDB. Local contractors are expected to be the
successful bidders for all distribution line construction which would be
carried out with materials mainly purchased by JPSC.
Disbursement
4.15      Disbursements from the loan account would be made for 100% of the
ex-factory costs of locally-produced items and for 100% of foreign expendi-
tures for:
(a) imported equipment and materials;
(b) contracts for installation and for erection of works;
(c) consultant's services; and
(d) the training program.
The following table shows estimated loan disbursements, assuming loan
effectiveness to be March 31, 1978.

June 30, 1982            2.9                   20.0
Disbursements would be fully documented.  The closing date would be
September 30, 1982, six months after the estimated completion of the project
to allow for the payment of retentions. Retroactive financing up to US$200,000
is proposed for payments made for consulting services after August 31, 1977
(see para. 4.17). Because of the continuous nature of transmission-distri-
bution work, any undisbursed amount of the proposed loan would be applied to
system extensions similar to those included in the project, after consultation
with the Bank.
Environment
4.16      JPSC intends to route its lines, which will be overhead, and locate
its substations so as to minimize their visual impact in a manner consistent
with economic and financial considerations.
Project Risks
4.17      The construction schedule assumed for the project is reasonable
and takes into consideration normal engineering, administrative and
construction procedures but it contains no provision for unusual delays.
Timely completion of the project will therefore depend greatly on the
appropriate use of consultants to assist in the design and supervision of
construction of 138 kV facilities, as well as on their engagement by JPSC
during the last half of 1977. One of the main project objectives is to
improve the reliability of service for which the use of consulting services is
considered of prime importance.

CHAPTER 5
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Summary
5.01      JPSC's financial performance from 1972 to 1975 was unsatisfactory
due principally to the failure of the PUC to grant adequate tariff increases
to offset rapid domestic and worldwide inflation. Its financial situation
improved in 1976 by virtue of an increase in its basic tariffs of 42% in
December 1975 and monthly increases of 1% during 1976 (see para. 5.06).
The company's financial condition was severely affected in 1977 by the in-
troduction of a two tier exchange rate system in Jamaica which increased
the cost of JPSC's foreign transactions by about 37%. Moderate tariff in-
creases (of 17% in 1978 and an average of 7% annually thereafter) will be
necessary during the project period to ensure that JPSC earns a reasonable
return (8 to 8.5% before income taxes) on its properly revalued rate base to
enable it to self-finance an adequate portion of its investment program after
payment of debt service (see para. 5.12). On this basis, JPSC's financial
outlook will improve steadily during the project's construction.
Earnings History and Financial Position
5.02      Principally because tariff increases were insufficient to cover
rapidly escalating costs, JPSC's financial performance deteriorated seriously
between 1972 and 1974. Net operating income declined by about 20%; operating
expenses increased by about 200%, principally because fuel costs increased by
over 400%. Although the fuel clause surcharge feature in its tariffs allowed
JPSC to recover most of the increased fuel costs, other operating expenses,
which increased by about 100%, were not recovered. A tariff increase was not
forthcoming until October 1974 and even then, its magnitude (39%) was not suf-
ficient to offset worldwide currency fluctuations, higher interest payments
(both of which increased JPSC's debt service), accelerated inflation anud higher
wage demands from labor unions. In 1972, JPSC's earnings just barely covered
interest; in 1973 and 1974 they did not even cover interest and the company
sustained losses.
5.03      Because af the undervaluation of JPSC's plant (see para. 5.11).
JPSC's 1972-75 rate of return on rate base derived from its financial state-
ments does not fully reflect its financial difficulties during this period.
Adjusting the rate base to compefnsate for worldwide and local inflation and
to reflect replacement costs would decrease the rate of return as shown below:

5.04      Beginning in 1975, the Government began to put JPSC on a more
reasonable financial footing. The 39% tariff increase in October 1974,
was followed by a further increase of 42% in December 1975. These in-
creases were instrumental in reversing the declining trend in JPSC's
earnings, although they were not enough to offset sharp increases in
operating expenses, most of which were the result of a 50% pay increase
awarded in September 1975 after protracted negotiations with the labor
unions. Net operating income in 1975 was about 3 times the 1974 level
but only barely covered interest.
5.05      JPSC's net internal cash generation was negative in 1972-75.
This, coupled with the absence of equity capital investments during 1972 and
1973, led the company to borrow heavily, mainly from Eximbank and partici-
pating US commercial banks, in order to finance its investment program between
1972 and 1975. In 1974, with its acquisition of JPSC nearly complete, the
Government, through the Electricity Authority, started to make additional
investments in the company. This was not sufficient, however, to help cover
the financial requirements including the soaring debt service; as a result,
JPSC relied on short-term borrowings. In order to improve its cash position,
JPSC has negotiated the conversion of about 80% of its short-term debt (about
J$13.5 million) into 5-year term loans bearing interest of about 13%.
Performance in 1976
5.06      In 1976, the Jamaican government took further steps toward putting
JPSC on a sound financial basis: a 1% per month increase in JPSC's basic
tariffs (i.e., excluding fuel clause) was granted as of January. The combined
effect of this and the two previous tariff increases in 1974 and 1975 enabled
JPSC to increase its net operating income in 1976 by about 170% over the
previous year, thus earning a rate of return on historical asset base of
21%, or about 11% on a revalued rate base (see Table 5.1). For the first time
since 1972, JPSC was able to cover its debt service from its own resources and
to self-finance a significant part (about 45%) of its annual construction
expenditures.
Financial Structure
5.07      JPSC's net fixed assets in operation (valued at original costs),
increased by 55% between 1972 and 1975. Up to 1975, the company's financial
structure had been unbalanced, marked by debt equity ratios averaging 80:20
and debt service coverage ratios well below one (as low as 0.52 in 1974); this
situation reflects the inadequacy of the tariff levels resulting in a very low
internal cash generation, and the insufficiency of equity contributions during
this period (para. 5.05).
5.08      JPSC's financial structure improved significantly in 1976 as a
result of the increase in tariffs which allowed for about J$13.8 million
of earnings after tax. The company's debt equity ratio declined to
76:24 (43:57 if revaluation surplus is included in equity) and its debt

service coverage ratio improved (1.1 compared to 0.6 in 1975). JPSC's
current ratio similarly improved (1.3 compared to 0.7 in 1975), as a result
of the refinancing of most of the short-term debts.
1977 Devaluation and its Aftermath
5.09      The adoption of a two tier exchange rate policy by the Jamaican
Government in April 1977 resulted in a financial setback for JPSC. Under the
new exchange rate system, JPSC's debt service is to be conducted at the
special exchange rate. As a direct result of the application of the special
rate, JPSC's 1977 financial requirements increased by about J$7 million,
principally for debt service but also in part for operation and maintenance
materials. JPSC is estimated to earn a rate of return on revalued assets of
about 7% in 1977 (compared to an estimated 9% before the adoption of the new
exchange rates), and would not generate enough cash internally to cover its
debt service. As a temporary measure, JPSC has obtained short and medium term
loans from the National Housing Trust and the Royal Bank of Jamaica. The
Government realizes that financial recovery by JPSC over the long run hinges
on improving its self-financing capability; to this end it has granted a
1-1/2% monthly cost of service adjustment in JPSC's tariffs as of
September 1977 for an indefinite period. It is likely to be needed throughout
1978 to enable JPSC to achieve the covenanted 8% rate of return for the
year.
Earnings Requirements
5.10      In the First Power loan to Jamaica the Bank depended on provisions
in JPSC's license then in force whereby electricity tariffs were to be set
so as to permit the utility to earn a rate of return (on its historical asset
base in operation) not exceeding 2.5 percentage points above the maximum yield
on Jamaican government bonds in the U.K. The company, however, was not able
to achieve this level of earnings partly because of limits on tariff increases
allowed by the Jamaican authorities, and this contributed to JPSC's consider-
able financial difficulties between 1972 and 1974. JPSC's current license (as
amended in April 1977) states that tariffs would be set by the Minister to
enable the utility to self-finance a proportion of its construction program
consistent with customary practices of public utilities. The tariff increases
granted in 1974-76 are certainly in the spirit of this provision; nevertheless,
a more specific measure of the need for future tariff adjustments is required
to adequately protect JPSC against the possibility of continued inflation and
currency realignments. It has been agreed that JPSC's tariffs will be set so
as to permit the utility to earn a pre-income tax rate of return on its
annually revalued average net fixed assets in operation of at least 8% annually
between 1978 and 1980 and 8.5% annually thereafter. This provision is con-
sistent with the existing JPSC license and would enable JPSC to self-finance a
satisfactory percentage of its investment program (see para. 5.12). JPSC's
profit is subject to taxation under the general internal revenue laws. The
company, however, did not have to pay taxes between 1972 and 1976 due to
provisions for carrying forward previous losses. As of December 31, 1976 it



- 29 -
had accumulated tax losses carried forward of J$20.7 million. The pre-tax
rates of return agreed upon are equivalent to after tax rates of return
averaging 6.4% over the 1978-82 project construction period, declining to 5%
in 1983. While these after tax rates of return appear to be low, they are
acceptable, since the average tariff levels that would result from the agreed
rate of return would be more than sufficient to recover the incremental cost
of electricity supply in Jamaica (para. 6.01). Government equity investments
during the project construction period will be equivalent to about 70% of
JPSC's forecast income tax payments.  With the forecast tariffs, JPSC would
contribute about 39% of its financing requirements during the 1978-82 con-
struction period of the project. This level of self-financing is satisfactory,
and it would not be reasonable to expect JPSC to increase its tariffs above
the projected levels.
5.11      To provide a meaningful measure of operating performance a rate
of return must be applied to an appropriately revalued asset base. JPSC's
assets are recorded at original cost. About 80% of its plant has been put
in operation since 1965. Worldwide and local inflation may not have been
significant before then but between 1965 and 1975 the consumer Price Index
in Metropolitan Kingston increased 180% while the price index of manufactured
exports from developed countries increased by about 220%; price increases
with respect to public utility plant may have been lower than these, never-
theless the need for revaluation of JPSC's assets is apparent. Preliminary
estimates indicate that JPSC's plant as of December 1976 should be revalued by
about 115% (see footnote e, Table 5.6). JPSC agreed that, as a condition of
effectiveness of the loan it would revalue its assets as of December 1976 in
accordance with methods acceptable to the Bank. It also agreed to revalue
its assets each year thereafter. Although JPSC would not be required to enter
these revaluations in its accounts it has agree to have its external auditors
review the results of the revaluations and their effects on the audited
financial statements. JPSC would submit this review as part of the periodic
reporting requirements to the Bank.
Financing Plan
5.12      JPSC's financing plan for the 1978-82 program is reasonable.
Net internal cash generation, after payments of debt service, preference share
dividends and taxes, would amount to 39% of the company's financing require-
ments.  Existing and proposed loans fromi IDB, a meuium term loan negotiated
with a consortium of local banks led by the Royal Bank of Jamaica, the pro-
posed IBRD and Canadian loans and suppliers' credits for the generating units
would provide 48%; equity capital investments from the government would
provide the remaining 13% of JPSC's financing requirements during the program
period. JPSC's funds forecast is summarized below and shown in more detail in
Table 5.2:

1/ JPSC is expected to pay US$34.9 million in income taxes during the
period. These are shown as deductions from internal cash generation.
If JPSC were tax-exempt, as in the case of most power borrowers, its
internal cash generation would be 56% as shown in brackets.



- 31 -
5.13      The proposed US$20 million Bank loan would be made to JPSC for a
term of 17 years including 4 years of grace at the current Bank interest rate,
assumed for the purpose of financial projections to be 8% per year; the loan
would be guaranteed by Jamaica. It will cover all of the project's foreign
cost.
5.14      JPSC's projectea financing plan includes about Can$31 million
which would be part of a Can$65 million loan agreement recently concluded
between the governments of Jamaica and Canada. The loan has a 60/40 partici-
pation by Canada's Export Development Corporation (EDC) and a consortium of
Canadian commercial banks. It will be repaid over a period of 10 years
beginning in April 1982; interest will be 8-1/2% on the EDC portion and 2
percentage points above LIBOR on the commercial banks' portion. The govern-
ment has confirmed its intention to allocate Can$31 million to JPSC or to
cause to be provided to JPSC equivalent financing from other sources on
similar or better terms.
5.15      The financing plan includes equity investments from the Government
totalling approximately J$31 (US$25) million. About J$20 million of this
amount is direct equity investments of J$10 million in 1978 and J$5 million
in each of 1979 and 1982. The remaining J$11 million is the Government's
portion of the on-going and proposed rural electrification projects. The
government's intention to provide equity investments to JPSC in the amounts
indicated has been confirmed.
5.16      JPSC's financial projections assume retention of all earnings
other than those needed for operationR and payment of debt service, taxes,
and preference share dividends. To ensure that JPSC retains adequate earnings
in the enterprise as assumed, the Government agreed that in the event of cash
dividends being paid on ordinary shares during the projects' construction, it
would reinvest its portion in JPSC.
Projected Financial Situation
5.17      JPSC's financial condition will improve steadily during the forecast
period. As shown in Table 5.8, its debt service coverage ratio will increase
from about 0.6 in 1975 to about 2.3 in 1982 and its debt/equity ratio will
decline from 79/21 at year end 1975 to about 53/47 in 1982 (25/75 if the
surplus from revaluation is included in equity) thus providing ample margin
for debt revaluation as well as for additional borrowing. Its operating ratio
will remain at satisfactory levels.
5.18      The forecast balance sheets (Table 5.6) show a considerable
improvement in JPSC's current position.  This is due to the refinancing of the
term loans (para. 5.05), the repayment of overdrafts remaining at the end of
1976, and a reduction in accounts payable (from 58 days of cash requirements
for operating expenses and construction in 1975 to 30 days for the forecast
period).



- 32 -
Debt Limitations
5.19      To ensure that the improvement in its financial condition projected
for the program construction period is not jeopardized by excessive reliance
on short-term borrowing JPSC has agreed to limit such borrowing to no more
than the equivalent of one sixth of its cash requirements for all operating
costs for the preceding 12 months.
5.20      JPSC agreed also not to incur any long-term debt without the Bank's
concurrence unless its internal cash generation covers the maximum debt service
in any succeeding year 1.5 times. Because JPSC's debt service during the
project's construction will be high, Bank approval of future borrowing is
expected to be necessary.
Security
5.21      In the first power loan JPSC was required to issue debentures
(denominated in Sterling) and bonds (denominated in the currencies in
which disbursements were made) as collateral for the loan. This arrangement
was necessary to prevent private debenture holders from having a prior claim
on JPSC's assets. Because JPSC still has senior securities outstanding
it agreed to make arrangements to issue debentures and bonds as collateral for
the proposed loan.
Performance Indicators
5.22      The financial indicators summarized in para. 5.17, the greater
accessibility of electric service, the reduction of outages and other improve-
ments reflected in Table 5.8 are agreed-upon targets which will be used to
monitor JPSC's performance during project construction.

E )NOMIC ANALYSIS
Pc,ier Tariffs
6.01      The preceding chapter shows that the level of JPSC's tariffs
would be adequate to cover the utility's financial needs, provided they
cover its accounting costs and generate the agreed-upon return on revalued
assets. The 16% rate of return estimated for the investment program (see
para. 6.05) implies that JPSC's average tariffs are higher than the incremental
economic cost of electricity supply.
6.02      That the structure of JPSC's tariffs (summarized in Annex 6.1) is
also adequate is, however, open to question. While the tariff structure has
several desirable features it also has others whose virtues are not as readily
discernible. Among some of its more desirable features are:
(a)  separate demand and energy charges for industrial and
commercial consumers;
(b)  discounts to encourage large industrial consumers to
accept supply at a higher voltage; and
(c)  a fuel clause surcharge.
Among the features that are open to question are:
(a)  a lack of differentiation between consumption during peak
and off peak hours;
(b)  a declining block tariff with the undemonstrated implicit
assumption of declining marginal cost of electricity supply;
(c)  the absence of regional differences in the tariffs, which
would suggest that there may not be any cost differences
in supplying electricity to different regions; and
(d)  the great difference between the unit prices charged to
industrial consumers and those charged to residential
customers.
Some of these features could very well be the result of deliberate yet
unstated policies, such as the promotion of industrial development (by not
penalizing industrial customers for consumption during peak hours or by
having other classes of consumers subsidize them) or a subsidization of rural
consumers by not charging them for the higher costs incurred in supplying



- 42 -
electricity to them. However, the potential consequences of these actions -
artificial stimulation to electicity demand, or cross-subsidization between
consumers - may have been unintended. JPSC has therefore agreed to engage
consultants to study the marginal cost of supplying electricity in Jamaica so
that sector policy makers may have additional information for evaluating the
economic impact of pricing policies.
Least Cost Solution
6.03      JPSC has rationalized its generation program (not part of the
projec4) by minimizing the present value of the sum of the cost to the
Jamaican economy of outages expected from several alternative installation
plans and the investment and operating costs of these plans. The generating
system's reliability level for which this sum is a minimum is that which has
a loss of load probability of about 5 days/year. This reliability level, in
conjunction with the expected outage rate of each existing and planned unit,
was used to determine the installation program. In making these calculations,
JPSC has estimated that the cost to the economy of a kWh not supplied is
J$0.46, which is somewhat lower than, but reasonably consistent with, those
which resulted from Bank-conducted studies in Jamaica. The discount rate used
by JPSC (13%) in its studies is someThat higher than the opportunity cost of
capital estimated for Jamaica (11%).
6.04   - For most of the equipment and lines included in the program, such
as type of transformers or meters, no reasonable alternative exists. Where
alternatives do exist, e.g., in routing of transmission lines and location of
substations, JPSC has selected or will select the least-cost solution which is
compatible with safety considerations. As a possible alternative to the
Duncans-Bellevue 138 kV transmission line, JPSC is considering advancing the
Tredegar-Bellevue line (see map), a shorter but more difficult line. Before
proceeding with final designs and bidding documents for the Duncans-Bellevue
line, but not later than June 30, 1978, JPSC has agreed to complete its
ongoing studies, seek the Bank's concurrence to them and has covenanted to
build the line which results in the least cost alternative.
Return on Investment
6.05      The benefits of the five-year investment program of which the
project is part, have been compared with its costs by equating the present
values of the streams of costs and of estimated benefits (as measured by the
forecast revenues from sales of electricity at the retail level, using the
tariffs in effect as of August 1977) associated with the program through its
assumed life of 30 years. The equalizing discount rate is about 16%, which
compares favorably with the opportunity cost of capital for Jamaica estimated
to be 11%. This equalizing rate probably understates the real economic rate of
return of the program, as revenues from the sales of electricity may not fully
measure some of the benefits to society, such as the social benefits of resi-
dential and public uses, or the indirect benefits to industry and commerce,
whose production and employment depend on a reliable electricity supply.
Table 6.1 contains the cost and benefit streams; the underlying assumptions
appear as footnotes to the table.

6.06      The result obtained is based on economic efficiency prices for all
inputs except labor and foreign exchange. The use of efficiency prices for
labor, which would be appropriate due to Jamaican underemployment, would
increase the rate of return. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to
determine whether any rate of exchange, other than 1US$ = 1.25 J$, which is
the applicable rate for all of JPSC's transactions except purchase of fuel,
would materially change the results. The results of this analysis, reproduced
below, indicate that the rate of return is not significantly affected by
changes in the foreign exchange rate.

6.07      In order to determine the effect of a larger time-slice on the
rate of return, a similar cost-benefit analysis was carried out substituting
a 9-year investment program for the selected 5-year one (see Table 6.1).
The resulting rate of returr. was abuut 17%, only slightly higher than the one
previously obtained, thus indicating that the rate of return is relatively
insensitive to the time period selected, which is to be expected inasmuch as
JPSC's construction program is relatively continuous.
6.08      Sensitivity analyses were carried out to determine the effect on
the rate of return of variations in the following parameters: (a) the rate of
growth of sales (or in the percentage of new sales than can be made through
existing facilities); (b) the price of fuel to JPSC, which in addition to
following international prices, may change due to changes in the government
policy regarding exchange rates (para 1.03), (c) the policy regarding recovery
of fuel-price increases, (d) the cost of the program. The results, which
indicate rates of return which compare favorably with the opportunity cost of
capital for all likely variations in these parameters, are shown in the graphs
of Figure 6.1.
6.09      From all of the above, it may be concluded that the economic rate of
return of the program of which the project is part is adequate, that it is not
significantly affected by possible misjudgements of the basic parameters which
determine it, and that the project is probably overdue as the rate of return
is significantly higher than the opportunity cost of capital in Jamaica.

SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
Condition for Loan Effectiveness
7.01      Before declaring the loan effective the Bank should receive
satisfactory evidence that JPSC has revalued its assets as of December 31,
1976 (para. 5.11).
Assurances and Covenants
7.02      During negotiations agreement was reached with the Government and
JPSC, as applicable, on the following principal points:
(a) The Government will study the existing relationships between
power sector institutions (para. 1.19);
(b) JPSC will establish an internal audit department, directly
responsible to the Executive Chairman (para. 2.05);
(c) Government and JPSC will consult with the Bank before
implementing any changes in JPSC's three top positions or
in the persons holding such positions and JPSC will appoint
a suitable chief financial officer (para 2.06);
(d) JPSC will engage consultants to assist in: improving
operating and maintenance practices (para. 2.07); preparing
a detailed training program (para. 2.10); engineering and
supervision of 138 KV facilities (para. 4.12); and studying
tariffs (para. 6.02);
(e) JPSC will study the feasibility of billing its customers
monthly and use its best efforts to keep its outstanding
accounts receivable within agreed upon targets (para. 2.14);
(f) JPSC will review with the Bank the timing of its next two
generation units and will not undertake any major construction
expenditure other than the program unless it provides satisfac-
tory justification (para. 4.03);
(g) JPSC's tariffs will be set so as to enable it to earn
rates of return on its average annually revalued net fixed
assets of at least 8% per year starting in 1978 to 1980 and
8.5% thereafter (para. 5.10);
(h) The Government has confirmed its intention to allocate J$31
million to JPSC in loan funds to provide equity investments
of J$31 million and to reinvest in JPSC its portion of any
ordinary dividends paid during construction of the project
(paras. 5.14-16);



- 53 -
(i)  JPSC will limit its short-term debt to not more than one-sixth
of its cash requirements for operating costs and will not
incur any long-term debt unless its internal cash generation
covers its maximum future debt service at least 1.5 times
(paras. 5.19-20); and
(j) JPSC will complete its studies leading to determining the
least cost alternative between Tredegar-Bellevue and
Duncans-Bellevue transmission lines, would seek the Bank's
concurrence to these studies and will build the least cost
alternative (para. 6.04).
Recommendation
7.03      With the above agreements, the project constitutes a suitable basis
for a Bank loan of US$20 million equivalent for a term of 17 years including
4 years of grace.
