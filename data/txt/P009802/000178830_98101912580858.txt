INDIA
JAMMU AND KASHMIR AND HARYANA
SOCIAL FORESTRY PROJECT
I. Introduction
1.01    In rural India, commercial energy sources (coal, electricity, oil,
etc.) supply very little of the demand, principally due to their high
cost. While 50% of villages in Jammu and Kashmir (JAK) and all in Haryana
are electrified, crop residues, dung cake and fuelwood (including twigs,
leaves and fallen branches often swept from the forest floor) continue to
form the main sources of energy for domestic use (paras 2.16 and 5.10).
Much of the fuelwood burnt is gathered by women, who, often faced with no
alternative source of supply, gather their requirements by tresspassing on
forest reserves. Many families, however, due to absence of forest areas
adjacent to their homes, are forced to burn only dung cake and crop
residues.
1.02    Forests constitute only 3.7% of the area of Haryana State and
12.5% of Jammu and Kashmir State and are distributed non-uniformly over
both States, leaving some districts and many panchayats practically devoid
of any woodland or public wasteland on which forests can be developed.
1.03    In both States, rapid population growth and expanding agricultural
production and growing demands from expanding wood-based industries in JAK
has meant that existing forests are being subjected to growing demands for
forest products to meet daily requirements of timber, fuel and grazing
(including supplementary leaf fodder from trees) for livestock.
1.04    Furthermore, limited expenditures on forest development (only 1%
of total government development expenditures over the period 1974-79 in
JAK and 0.8% in Haryana's State budget over a similar period) have tradi-
tionally been directed to the establishment of commercial plantations and
protection of existing reserves. Nevertheless, faced with ever increasing
degradation of forest reserves in those areas adjacent to concentrations
of human population, forest administrators of both States have come to
realize that rapid depletion of their forests could not be stopped by
rigid enforcement of the laws, but required development of a policy
whereby forestry became more meaningful to rural communities who con-
stitute 80% of the population of both States. In addition, throughout
India, a national policy has now emerged whereby forests are being estab-
lished in cooperation with villagers living nearby and designed to provide
products for basic human needs, to generate employment and preserve the
environment.
1.05    Land available for the development of forestry in rural areas is
limited and falls into four broad categories. Firstly, government owned
land, most of which has now been allocated for other use and the remainder
of which is generally confined to narrow strips along roads, railways and



-2-
canal banks. Secondly, village panchayat owned land, which is histori-
cally unevenly distributed amongst panchayats and is normally unsuited to
agriculture, but providing much needed grazing for village livestock.
Privately owned land forms the third category, generally intensively
cultivated and with only field boundaries and small waste patches avail-
able for tree growing. Lastly, and scattered throughout India, are areas
of forest reserves and many of which, by virtue of their being adjacent to
human habitation, have been increasingly subjected to degradation.

II. BACKGROUND
A. Forestry in India
Sectoral Context
2.01    India's forests account for 23% of the total land area and cover
some 75 M ha. Annual domestic roundwood requirements by the year 2000
are projected to be nearly 290 M m3 (fuelwood 225 M m3 and industrial
roundwood 65 M m3). Continuation of existing plantation programs of about
100,000 ha annually, should ensure the supply of industrial hardwood (52 M
m3) and about half of the coniferous roundwood demand (13 M m3).  Regard-
ing fuelwood, on the assumption that 17 M m3 continues annually to be
supplied from existing resources, provision will have to be made for an
additional 208 M m3 by the year 2000. This would require an annual plant-
ing program of some 650,000 ha, but in terms of availability of financial
resources, this target cannot be achieved. Plantings of at least 300,000
ha annually over the 1980's would be a more realistic target. 1/
2.02    India's strategy for forestry development now reflects two
priorities: firstly, through social forestry programs to supply fuelwood,
fodder, small timber and minor forest produce to the rural population and
secondly, to develop production forestry to supply the growing needs of
the domestic wood products industry (particularly pulp and paper). Encom-
passing both objectives is recognition of the vital role forestry plays in
soil and water conservation. In order to carry out this strategy, the
National Commission on Agriculture (1976) recommended that each State
reorganize its Forest Department into two separate wings, one to remain in
charge of traditional production forestry and wildlife activities, while a
new wing would be established to develop social forestry. The Forest
Departments of Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil
Nadu and Maharashtra have already created social forestry wings, and Jammu
and Kashmir, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa and Karnataka are
expected to follow shortly. It is expected that some 1.93 M ha of social
forestry plantations would be established under the auspices of these
newly created wings by the end of 1988, reflecting a total government
investment of Rs. 5,950 M (US$ 700 M).
1/ The estimates given for fuelwood production differ from those given
in previous SARs on social forestry projects. Mission estimates that
some 40 M ha of India's forest land's are, more or less, devoid of any
tree cover and that current recorded production of fuelwood from
forest reserves is less than 10% of total requirements for cooking and
heating. The balance is obtained from illegal felling from forest
reserves, private plantations and the use of crop waste and dung cake.

Bank Group Role in the Sector
2.03    To assist State governments in carrying out the policy of rural
participation in forestry development, IDA has financed projects in
Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal States with the following objec-
tives:
(a) to increase fuelwood supplies through the establishment of
plantations on public, village and private wastelands;
(b) to secure the cooperation of the local populations by involv-
ing them in the planning, execution and protection of planta-
tions; and
(c) to establish an organization required to support long-term
social forestry programs.
The Uttar Pradesh Project was appraised in November 1978 and a Credit for
US$ 23 M approved in June 1979; the Gujarat Project was appraised in March
1979 and a Credit of US$ 37 M approved in December 1979. Retroactive
financing in both projects enabled an early start to be made as staff were
recruited and tree nurseries established prior to project effectiveness.
A third project was appraised in West Bengal in January 1981 and a Credit
of US$ 29 M approved in October 1981.
Planting Progress of On-going Projects

The West Bengal Project (Credit 1178-IN). By the end of the first
planting season the project has achieved the following:
Category of Planting              Appraisal Target  Actual  % of Target
Strip Plantations (ha)                   430           502        116

Farm Forestry (ha)                     1,460         2,902        198
As can be seen from the above achievements, all three projects have made
more than satisfactory physical progress. However, it should be noted
that the development of community self-help schemes has proceeded slower
than anticipated. There are two main reasons for this delay. Firstly,
the Indian village is not a homogenous society and group decisions do not
come easily or quickly. Secondly, village panchayats have a very limited
capacity to raise funds either directly or indirectly for development
works. Nevertheless, the demand is there and State governments are seek-
ing alternate ways of financing planting operations. Cooperation between
villages and Forest Departments, particularly in respect to protection,
has improved and costs of this item are much reduced. Tree survival rates
are better than anticipated but stove improvement programs have been slow
to develop due to high cost of an improved stove. This matter is being
investigated. Project management has been good but project monitoring and
evaluation procedures slow to be initiated.
2.05    Other assistance to the forestry sector includes the Madhya
Pradesh Forestry Technical Assistance Project (Credit 609-IN), which is
the intital phase of a major project aimed at the establishment of a
forest-based industry in Bastar District. The feasibility study (November
1980), financed under the Credit, recommended the establishment of an
integrated industrial complex with one mill producing sawnwood and a pulp
mill producing kraft pulp to supply a printing and paper mill. The Kandi
Watershed and Area Development Project (Loan 1897-IN, approved in 1978)
involves reforestation and pasture development over some 18,000 ha of
Punjab's Siwalik Hills.

2.06    As a result of the satisfactory progress in the implementation of
the three earlier social forestry projects and based on requests prepared
by the State governments of Jammu and Kashmir and Haryana, a mission
comprised of D.A. Mitchnik, W. Nickel (IDA), N. Chatterjee, A. Molnar, J.
Smart and R. Noronha (consultants) visited both States in October/November
1981.
B. The State of Jammu and Kashmir
General
2.07    The State of Jammu and Kashmir with an area of 138,214 km2, has a
population of about 6 M (1981), of which 80% reside in rural areas.
Economic development in the State has been slow. Heavy industries are
non-existent. The most important small industries are cottage industries,
such as manufacture of silk cloth, woolens, embroidered cloth, carpets,
wood carving and papier mache articles. Tourism is significant, providing
6% of State GDP. Agriculture is predominant, accounting for 51% of State
income and providing 71.5% of its employment.
2.08    Population density averages 130 persons per km2, but there is  2
considerable inter-district variation ranging from a high of 275 per km
(1971) in Srinagar/Badgam districts in the Kashmir valley to a low of 29
per km2 in Doda district in the Chenab valley. There is a negligible
proportion of scheduled castes in most districts, excepting Doda and
Udampur and Jammu in the southeast part of the State, where about 25% of
the population falls in this category.
2.09    The rural population is spread over 5,857 villages, each with an
average population of about 800. Ecological differences and
socio-cultural factors influence variations in the incidence of poverty
between regions and different segments of the population. Per capita
income is low, estimated at 1222 Rs (1980, US$144). Prior to land reform,
which was started in 1973, tenancy and presence of landless laborers was
high. At present farms are in general small with 78% of all holdings
having less than 2 ha. Details are given in Annex 13.
2.10    Livestock forms an integral part of village life; a household
possesses on the average three or four cattle or buffalo which provide
milk, draught power, manure and in more than half of the State, dung cake
for cooking. Cattle and buffalo are generally grazed on community lands
near the villages and their feed supplemented with agricultural products
and tree loppings. There is a sizable population of migratory sheep and
goat flocks exploiting the high alpine pastures in the north and the
Siwalik Hills in the south.
2.11    Population pressures and the increasing livestock numbers (of
which there are an estimated 4.7 M) necessitate the continual search for
food, fuel, and fodder. This has resulted in indiscriminate tree-cutting



-7-
and increasing erosion. Consequently, the southern and western parts of
the State now have large tracts of barren waste lands. In the northern,
more forested areas of the State, there is increasing competition between
commercial and fuelwood needs leading again to uncontrollable depredations
of the forests.
Panchayat System
2.12    The Jammu and Kashmir Village Panchayats Act, 1958, introduced a
two-tier system of panchayats (elective corporate bodies) in the State.
The two tiers comprise village panchayats at the lowest level which con-
sist of a group of revenue villages (mauza) at the lower level; and at the
Block level (usually a sub-district) a Block Panchayat Board (BPB). At
the BPB level provision is made for the representation of women. There
are 1,406 village panchayats in the State.
2.13    Panchayats can undertake a wide range of activities which fall
under two heads: compulsory, and discretionary functions. The former
includes protection of all agricultural lands from floods and erosion; the
latter, the right to plant trees, including fruit trees, on waste lands.
The State also has the power to add to the compulsory functions of the
panchayat. From 1958 till 1973 all undemarcated forests were vested in
the panchayat.
2.14    The State provides both administrative and financial assistance to
panchayats. Under the former category, officials are seconded or trans-
ferred to panchayats to act as secretaries. Further, in preparation of
the annual plan, design for all works over Rs. 50 (approx. US$6.00) are
prepared by the Block overseer, a government employee. The annual plan is
approved by the Block Advisory Committee, the Block Development Officer
and, since 1976, the District Development Board. Most panchayat funds are
derived from State grants and cover regular expenses (salaries, estab-
lishment charges, travelling allowances) and those of assigned works.
Funds raised by each Panchayat through taxes, rates and fees are small and
generally average about Rs. 4,000 (US$470) per year. All accounts are
audited annually by the Director, Community Development, and arrears of
audit are few -- an estimated 10 percent.
2.15    Since social forestry is a relatively recent program in the State,
there has not been a major involvement of panchayats in this program.
Further, historical problems such as land availability have been con-
straints on such involvement. There is, however, widespread recognition
of the need for social forestry and a willingness on the part of many
panchayats to plant trees on panchayat lands.

Present Consumption of Energy
2.16    No accurate figures are available on the total domestic energy
consumption in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Approximately 50,000 tons
of fuelwood are produced annually from JAK forests. Commercial energy
sources (coal, electricity, oil) supply very little of the demand. While
50% of rural villages in JAK are electrified, only a negligible amount is
used for cooking or heating purposes due to the high cost. In JAK these
sources probably provide at most 3%, with the remaining 97% being met by
fuelwood and dung cake.
2.17    The fuelwood requirement varies within the project area.  Mission
estimates based on limited available data for consumption in Kashmir
region are about one to two bundles of wood (20 kgs. each) per household
per day or 1.2 tons per capita FWE yearly. 1/ In the Chenab valley yearly
requirements are about 1.1 tons FWE, while in the warmer plains region of
Jammu, per capita consumption is roughly 0.8 tons FWE p.a., based on a
daily household requirement of 18 kgs. of wood.  Total domestic energy
consumption in the State is thus about 6.2 M tons/FWE p.a. of which only
0.2 M tons is met from commercial energy sources. The remaining 6 M tons
EWE is estimated to be derived from:
Amount 1/         FWE 1/            %
Fuelwood and Charcoal              4.2 M tons        4.2 M tons      70
Dung Cake                          4.2 M tons        1.8 M tons      30
1/ Mission Estimates.
To meet the present requirements of fuelwood and dung equivalent (assuming
a mean annual increment of 7 tons of wood per ha) an area of 0.8 M ha of
plantations would be needed.
2.18    Dung cake is used extensively as a fuel in both the Jammu and
Kashmir regions, while in Chenab, due to greater density of forest and
presence of natural, private tree stands, only wood is used as fuel. In
Jammu and Kashmir, release of dung cake for use as an organic manure would
add considerable nutrient value to the soil for crop production. One ton
of wet dung (1/5 ton dung cake) yields 3.5 kgs. of nitrogen, 1.5 kgs. of
1/ Fuelwood Equivalent.



-9-
phosphate, and 1 kg. of potassium, 1/ and in addition significant improve-
ment of soil tilth which would otherwise be lost. In all three regions
considerable time (up to half a day) is spent, by villagers, particularly
women and children, in collecting cow dung, wood, and even leaves and
twigs to meet daily domestic energy requirements. Some fuelwood is sold
in the region, with prices averaging Rs. 200 per ton. Dung cake is sold
mostly in the Jammu region at Rs. 0.13 per cake, or Rs. 250 per ton.
C. Forestry in Jammu and Kashmir
Environmental Conditions and Forest Types
2.19    Jammu and Kashmir State covers a wide range of ecologies -- from
the temperate Himalayan range in the North with its peaks, valleys and
foothills to the sub-tropical plains in the South. The project area
comprises three ecological regions: Kashmir, Jammu and Chenab, excluding
Ladakh region which is not included in the project area, because of
extreme cold desert conditions which makes the establishment of tree
plantations very difficult.
2.20    The Kashmir Valley lies in the northern part of the State,
originating from an old lake bed and is more or less flat with varied lake
terraces and is surrounded by hills with steep-sided valleys which give
rise to the Jhelum river system. The valley itself is at an elevation
of 1800 meters above sea level with soils formed from sediments and
alluvium of pleistocene and post-pleistocene age. The highest part of the
project area is at 8,600 meters a.s.l. at the summit of K2 in the
Himalayan system of largely crystalline granite and metamorphic rocks.
2.21    The Jammu plains in the South lie at around 500 meters above sea
level and are of recent alluvial origin. They are bounded to the north by
the Siwalik Hills, formed of sandstone conglomerates and clays by outwash
from the Himalayas, and which form the Tawi river catchment flowing into
the Chenab river in Pakistan. The intervening hilly region of steep-sided
valleys with unstable slopes lying between the Siwalik Hills and the high
Himalayas, gives rise to the Chenab river system. The geological strata
dip towards the North and it is these northern slopes which have more
stable soils and provide better conditions for tree growth.
2.22    The three regions have different climates dependent on the
incidence of monsoon rainfall and elevation. A winter season (November to
February) occurs in all three regions. Throughout Kashmir and in the
higher parts of Chenab, the winter is severe with temperatures below
1/ National Dairy Development Institute, Karnal.



-10-
freezing point; while in the lower parts of Chenab and in Jammu somewhat
milder winter conditions prevail.
2.23    In Kashmir and the higher parts of Chenab and Jammu much of the
precipitation falls as snow from December to February. In Jammu and lower
Chenab heavy monsoon rains occur in July and August but are largely
prevented from reaching Kashmir by the intervening Pir Panjal mountain
range. Dry conditions prevail on the plains in April-May-June and in
October-November. Annual rainfall varies from 1,350 mm (rainfall equiv-
alent) p.a. in the Kashmir hills to 650 mm in the Kashmir Valley at
Srinagar; and from 1,500 mm in the Jammu foothills to 1,200 mm on the
plains.
2.24    The natural forests of Jammu and Kashmir fall into three broad
types correlating with the three climatic regions, viz.: the dry temperate
forests of Kashmir, mainly conifer; the wet temperate forests of Chenab,
both conifer and broadleaved; and the subtropical deciduous forests of
Jammu.
2.25    The forests are wholly owned by the State and are under the
managemen5 of the Forest Department. The total area of State forests is
21,000 km (15.2% of total geographic area). About 35% of State forests
not committed to National Parks and Game Reserves, are more or less devoid
of tree cover through uncontrolled grazing and indiscriminate tree felling
by the rural population. In addition, the State has 341,000 ha of waste
and marginal land (excluding current fallows), much of which is suitable
for afforestation.
2.26    The productivity of much of the conifer forest is high having been
exploited under controlled working plans and naturally regenerated for
many years; but the outer edges of these forests, adjoining alpine pasture
and the farming areas are everywhere being severely damaged or destroyed.
2.27    An understanding of forest conservation is lacking in most sec-
tions of the community. Traditionally, the forest has been regarded as an
apparently inexhaustible supply of free produce and the free use of the
forests is taken for granted by the rural population. During the last
decade there has been increasing realization by the Forest Department of
the need to promote social forestry and a small social forestry program
has been started (para 2.39).
Contribution of Forests to the Economy
2.28    Contribution of the forestry sector to State income was estimated
in 1979 to be 7% (Rs. 500 M) out of a total of Rs 6,992 M. In 1970-79,
the recorded average a nual production from the State forests was 442,000
m3 of timber, 77,000 m  of fuelwood and 34,000 m tons of resin.  In addi-
tion, a wide variety of minor forest products were extracted, including



-11-
bamboos, gums, dried leaves, edible flowers, fruits, medicinal plants and
oilseeds.
2.29    State forests support a number of small-scale industries:  some
1,200 sawmills, 2 joinery milling units, 1 match splint unit, 1 resin
processing unit and several cottage scale units producing sports goods
such as cricket bats and badminton rackets.
2.30    Wood obtained from poplars grown on farmers' lands in the Kashmir
Valley helps to sustain the fruit growing and export trade. The present
annual production of fruit, mainly apples, is about 0.45 M tons for which
a significant quantity of wood is required for manufacturing shooks (fruit
boxes) for packing purposes. While trade in apples is expected to rise
from about .40 M m tons in 1980 to an estimated .51 M m tons by 1987,
demand for shooks has probably peaked with the recent introduction of
cheaper corrugated cardboard tray-pack cartons.
2.31    The State forests also help to sustain the thriving wood hand-
icrafts industry. Carved bric-a-brac, furniture, etc., made of walnut
wood are a specialty of the State and are sold to tourists and exported.
It is estimated that the current annual employment in such small scale
cottage industries and shook manufacture totals some 8.4 M mandays.
2.32    The forests provide considerable benefits to marginal farmers and
landless farm laborers (who form the bulk of the population in and around
the forests) in the form of free fuelwood, fruit, flowers, fodder and
grazing, medicinal plants, leaves, poles for hut construction, etc.
Employment in forest areas also provides the main source of earnings to
these people. In 1979-80, primary forest production generated some 7.6 M
mandays of employment.
2.33    Shortages of primary forest products, especially fuelwood, build-
ing poles and fodder are becoming increasingly severe and are likely to
worsen in the near future. In view of the acute shortage of fuelwood and
charcoal in the urban areas, the Forest Department has had to convert good
grade timber for meeting these requirements. Although rehabilitation and
improved management of the existing forest estate will help to alleviate
the situation, the magnitude of the problem and the uneven geographic
distribution of existing forest resources are such that the long-term
solution lies in the afforestation of new areas. Presently, many areas
such as road, rail and canal reserves, and other wastelands that could
grow trees, are unproductive. Thus, afforestation of new areas, combined
with rehabilitation of existing degraded forest would produce a reasonably
well distributed forest resource, with environmental as well as directly
productive benefits.



-12-
Forestry Institutions
2.34    The Head of the Jammu and Kashmir Forest Department (JAKFD) is the
Chief Conservator of Forests (CCF). He is supported at headquarters by
one Additional CCF (Addl. CCF) and one Deputy Conservator of Forests
(DCF). Also directly responsible to him are eight Conservators of Forests
(CF) and one Deputy Wild Life Warden.
2.35    At field level there are 7 operational Circles, each headed by a
CF. Each of these Circles is responsible for 3 to 9 Divisions (a total
of 48 Divisions). Each Division is headed by a Divisional Forest Officer
(DFO), who is usually a DCF and is assisted by an Assistant Conservator
of Forests (ACF). Within a Division there are 3 to 4 Range Offices, each
staffed by a Forest Ranger (FR) who is responsible for all technical
matters associated with the forest under his control. Each FR covers 3 to
4 Blocks and each is staffed by a Forester who is responsible for all
forestry activities within his Block and the supervision of 2 to 3 Forest
Guards (FG) employed to protect the forests.
2.36    There are four levels of formal forestry training.  Indian Forest
Service Officers (professional) are recruited from science graduates and
undertake a two-year course at the Indian Forest College operated by the
Central Government. State Forest Officers are also recruited from scielce
graduates, or promoted from the ranks of Forest Rangers, and trained in
the State Forest Service Colleges operated by the Central Government.
Range Officers are recruited partly from science graduates and partly from
serving Foresters. These are trained for two years at the GOI Forest
Rangers College at Dehra Dun. Foresters are recruited from outside the
service or from the ranks of serving Forest Guards. They are trained at a
one year course given at the Foresters Training Schools at Chattarnar and
Miran Sahib in JAK State. Forest Guards are recruited from secondary
school leavers and trained at one of the FG training schools at Chattarnar
and Miran Sahib.
Forest Corporation
2.37    The Jammu and Kashmir State Forest Corporation was established in
1979 and replaced the erstwhile Government Lumbering Undertaking. Created
under the Jammu and Kashmir State Forest Corporation Act, 1978, the
primary role of the Corporation is to undertake removal and exploitation
of forest resources entrusted to it by the Government. The Corporation is
also expected to undertake research programs relating to forestry and
forest products in the State.



-13-
Forestry Programs
2.38    All State forests are managed under the traditional form of 5 or
10 year working plans which are regularly brought up to date by the
Forestry Department. Reliance has been placed on natural regeneration for
replenishing exploited conifer forest using a 30-year regeneration period
and a 120-150 year rotation. However, there are now great difficulties
in the upper and lower reaches of the forests due to grazing pressure and
to increased lopping and hacking of standing trees by the rural population
and the rate of successful regeneration has fallen behind the rate of
exploitation, so that there is now a net annual overcutting of forests.
In addition, small plantations have been established in scattered
localities for soil conservation or for growing fuelwood for the urban
population including a larger area of Willow (Salix alba) plantations in
the permanent wetlands surrounding Wular lake and on other similar sites
in the Kashmir valley. At the end of 1980, the total area of plantations
was:
Wetland Plantations
Kashmir Valley                    7,287 ha
Farm Forestry Plantations
Kashmir Valley                    8,634 ha
Chenab Valley                       --
Jammu Region                      1,520 ha
Total (Wetland & Farm Forestry)        17,441 ha
2.39    Total tree nursery production during 1980-81 in both Government
and private sectors, is estimated at 10 M plants equivalent to 4,000 ha of
plantations.
2.40    Forest revenue has increased substantially over the last five
years from Rs 92.8 M in 1976-77 to Rs 340 M in 1980-81; but only a small
part of forest revenue has been reinvested in forest development, totall-
ing only Rs 37.5 M in the 5th plan period, 1974-79. This was only 1% of
total government development expenditure during the same period. During
the 6th Plan (1980/81 - 84/85), forest development expenditure was
increased to Rs 125 M or 3% of total development expenditure.
Social Forestry
2.41    Although a Social Forestry section of the Forest Department was
established under a Conservator of Forests in 1971-72 with 4 Divisions
(now 6), activities have largely been concerned with planting of institu-
tional owned land. Free seedlings have been available from a number of
nurseries for distribution through Block Development Officers to farmers,



-14-
but this program only reaches a very small part of the rural population.
Although farmers in the Kashmir Valley are accustomed to raising their own
poplar and willow plants from cuttings, they would prefer to be supplied
with rooted cuttings.

III. SUB-PROJECT : JAMMU AND KASHMIR
A. General
3.01    The project's primary objectives would be to increase supplies of
fuelwood to rural areas through the establishment of 44,000 ha of planta-
tions located in 12 districts of the State. Secondary objectives would be
to provide poles, small timber, fodder grass, fruits, oilseeds and other
minor products. In order to carry out this program the project would
provide training facilities, vehicles, housing, equipment and additional
staff for research and extension activities. The project would result in
considerable seasonal employment, estimated at 12 M man days 1/ and create
754 permanent jobs over 5 years.
General Description
3.02    During a five-year period the project would:
(a) establish 5,000 ha of village woodlots;
(b) rehabilitate and reforest 17,000 ha of degraded forests;
(c) establish 1,000 ha of strip plantings along roads, canals
and railroads;
(d) establish 19,000 ha of farm forestry on private land;
(e) establish 2,000 ha of plantings on wetlands;
(f) establish additional nurseries to provide planting stock;
(g) expand the existing Forester/Forest Guard schools;
(h) provide forestry staff at the operational and extension
levels, including staff to support publicity, research,
training, and monitoring activities;
(i) strengthen research activities, and construct tree seed
storage godowns;
(j) develop training of project staff including provision of
fellowships; and
(k) carry out a wood balance study.
I/ Equivalent to Rs. 108 M (US$ 12.7 M) or in the form of wages for
unskilled labor.



-16-
Prime responsibility for implementation would be with the Social Forestry
Wing (SFW) in the Forestry Department.

predict with certainty Panchayats and farmers' response to alternative
approaches to social forestry, flexibility would be maintained during
project implementation and would allow shifting from one category to
another according to results. This would be accomplished by monitoring
the results (para 3.44) and by a joint GOJAK/IDA review in project year
3.
B. Detailed Features
3.04    All five categories of plantations (village woodlots, wetlands
reforestation of degraded forests, afforestation of eroded agricultural
lands and wastelands and strip plantations) have differing conceptual,
establishment, management, harvesting, marketing, legal and funding fea-
tures which distinguish them from one another. Details of each category
are summarized in the following paragraphs.
3.05    Village Woodlots (5,000 ha respresenting 11.3% of total planting
program). Social Forestry Wing (SFW) would establish a minimum of 5 ha
of plantation per village panchayat and maintain the plantation for a
period of 4-5 years and employ labor for this purpose from the concerned
panchayat. Cost of planting, maintenance and protection would be borne by



-17-
SFW for the first 5 years but the local population would participate in
protecting the plantation. Thereafter, management and protection of the
plantation would be the responsibility of the village panchayat. At first
major harvest after establishment, SFW would recover its direct costs
(excluding the cost of seedlings) from the sale of fuelwood, timber, or
poles and the cash balance would be given to the panchayat. The panchayat
would utilize the funds either for financing public works in the village
(such as the construction of a water supply, or village road), or finance
the establishment of additional village woodlots. Villagers would collect
grass, fallen wood and tree loppings from plantation areas (estimated at
an annual production of 5-7 tons per ha of fuelwood from the 5th year
onwards, depending on species planted).
3.06    Village Woodlots would be established mainly in Kashmir and the
Chenab valley where the availability of private waste land is limited. In
the Kashmir valley much of the land available for private planting is
already under tree cover. Both areas, however, have large tracts of
village common lands which can be used for tree planting. In Jammu,
preference would be given to farm forestry where there is sufficient
marginal and waste lands for private planting.
Operating Procedures
3.07    Social Forestry Wing, acting through its field staff, would
encourage villages to participate in establishing village woodlots by
explaining the benefits to be obtained from communal plantations and
assist the panchayat in demarcating areas of waste lands which can be
planted to trees. In addition, SFW would explain the nature and provi-
sions of the agreement to be entered into between the panchayat and SFW
(Item 2 in Project File).   Agreement was reached during negotiations on
the nature and provisions of the model contract.
3.08    Once proposals have been agreed upon, village panchayats would be
assisted with implementation through regular visits from Social Forestry
Workers (SFW) and Motivators (para 4.05 and 4.06). SFW and Motivators
would develop the villagers' skills and understanding of forestry through
these visits, increased publicity (films, posters, talks) and by organiz-
ing one-day visits of groups of villagers to demonstration areas where
panchayats or farmers have developed their own plantations. In addition,
groups of progressive farmers and village panchayat committees would
participate in monthly one-day orientation training organized by the
Deputy Conservator of Forests and Asst. Conservator of Forests at the
district level.
3.09    Strip Plantations (1000 ha representing 2.2% of total planting
program).   SFW would establish plantations alongside roads, canals and
railways. Villagers who live close to these plantations would collect,
free of cost -- grass, fodder, fallen wood and tree loppings (estimated at



-18-
an annual production of 5-7 tons per ha). In return, they would cooperate
with project field staff in protecting these plantations. This form of
cooperation between the local population and forestry staff for the
protection of strip plantations and sharing of benefits has been in prac-
tice for the past two decades in all States in India. This has meant
that, by and large, such strips are not protected with barbed wire or
other forms of permanent fencing.
3.10    In many areas where population density is high, the only waste-
lands available are along roads, canals and railways. Therefore, strip
plantations become the prime source of minor forest products for the local
population.
3.11    Wetlands (2,000 ha representing 4.5% of total planting program).
SFW would establish plantations on State owned permanently inundated
wetlands. Village panchayats situated close to these areas would collect
fallen wood and tree loppings under the supervision of forestry staff.
SFW would recover its costs from the sale of fuelwood (generally to
Srinagar). Presently the supply of fuelwood to Srinagar (estimated at 10%
of overall Statewide fuelwood requirements) is carried out by the State
Government to ensure that adequate supplies are available to urban areas
and particularly in winter where temperatures are well below freezing
point. Cooperation between FD and village panchayats for the protection
and sharing of benefits of plantations on wetlands is being successfully
implemented on established wetland plantations (para 2.38).
3.12    Farm Forestry (19,000 ha representing 43% of total planting
program). SWF would distribute approximately 47.5 M seedlings free of
cost (some 2,500 seedlings per ha) to farmers to plant on private owned
waste lands and field boundaries.
3.13    Degraded Forests (17,000 ha representing 39% of total planting
program). SWF would rehabilitate and reforestate degraded State-owned
forest reserves through replanting with fuelwood and other species. Labor
would be employed from nearby panchanyats for establishment and main-
tenance. Villagers living at the edge of these forests would continue
to collect fallen wood, fodder and tree lopping under the supervision of
forestry staff and at felling 25% of fuelwood yields would be given to
neighboring village panchayats for distribution to local people. In
return, villagers would refrain from indiscriminate felling and destruc-
tion of State-owned forests. The nature and provisions of the agreement
to be entered into between the panchayat and SFW is given in item 4 of the
Project File. Agreement was reached during negotiations on the nature and
provisions of the model contract.
3.14    For the last three decades, foresters in India have been faced
with a major challenge: how to protect and improve the country's remain-
ing forest resource and how to preserve the environment. Past attempts by



-19-
forestry staff to enlist the cooperation of rural population in the
protection of forests have nearly always failed since foresters have
always been regarded as another type of police force. Moreover, State
owned forests are often the only source from which the local population
can obtain fuelwood. Under the project, the local population would, for
the first time, collect forest produce under the general supervision of
forestry staff and in return, it is hoped that it will refrain from
piecemeal destruction of forests. In addition, by encouraging farmers to
plant trees on field boundaries and other marginal lands and by estab-
lishing village woodlots, it is hoped that pressures put on existing
forests will be alleviated.
Plantation Design and Establishment
3.15    Overall 60-95% (depending on location) of trees planted would
produce fuelwood and/or small timber. Many of the recommended species
also produce good leaf fodder and the production of naturally-occuring
grasses would be enhanced by the protection of plantations from uncon-
trolled grazing. Although plantation produce would be mixed, the main
emphasis would be on fuelwood and small timber production. Fruit trees,
however, are an important component of some models; and the planting of
suitable species for leaf charcoal manufacture is an important feature in
Kashmir.
3.16    Although many of the recommended species are indigenous to India,
70% of planting would be of exotics, which are well naturalized and known
to FD. The range of species recommended is wide and covers a large range
of ecological conditions. Decisions on the species mix would be made
locally after considering the objectives of the plantations and the needs
of the locality. To ensure adequate seed supplies, the project will
provide funds for the construction of ten seed godowns, one for each
Division.
3.17    Overall nine plantation models have been developed to meet the
different objectives and site conditions of the State. However, many more
variations to cover the needs of subsites are possible, but in general all
models are rainfed, although limited hand watering is proposed for drier
sites.  Details are given in Item 1, Tables 1-9 of the Project File.
3.18    In strip plantations, fuelwood species predominate, with ornamen-
tal and shade trees included along roads. Fruit trees are included in the
Kashmir model.
3.19    In village woodlots and degraded forests, the emphasis is on
fuelwood and tree fodder species; bamboos are an important constituent in
the Siwalik Hills.



-20-
3.20    Wetland plantations in the Kashmir valley would be planted to
willow and poplar only.
3.21    Species recommended for farm forestry would be predominantly
willow and poplar in Kashmir and Eucalyptus and Leucaena species in Jammu.
3.22    Planting costs are given below:
Category of Planting                       Establishment Costs
(Rs/ha) a/
Degraded Forest                               4,200 - 4,500
Wetlands                                          4,000

Farm Forestry                                   600 - 900
a/ Expenditures incurred during the first five years, including nursery,
advance soil works, establishment, maintenance and protection. On
average, labor costs represent 90% of total planting expenditures
(Project File, Item 1, Tables 1-9).
Planting Programs
3.23    Annual planting programs would be agreed at State and district
committee meetings (see para 4.04 for constitution of these committees).
Planting sites would be selected and surveyed during the winter months
in Jammu and during the early summer in Kashmir, and pitting and other
advance soil and protective works carried out thereafter and in time for
the planting season. Pitting would be standard practice except on
degraded slopes where contour trenches would be dug. At high elevations,
planting would commence in late autumn and if necessary be completed in
the following spring. In Jammu potted seedlings for the current year's
planting would be transported to the site in advance of the onset of the
monsoon in late June/early July.
Nurseries
3.24    At present there are 15 nurseries in the State providing for
social forestry activities. Under the project, at least one permanent
nursery would be established in each Administrative Block; 1/
1/ There are 69 Block Panchayats.



-21-
additional temporary nurseries would be established as and when required.
Nurseries would be sited close to permanent water and either irrigation or
hand watering of seedlings would be standard practice. Permanent nur-
series would be in charge of a Forester, temporary ones under the control
of SFW field staff.
3.25    Most tree seed would be collected locally and stored and tested at
seed godowns to be located in each Division. Seed collection would be
regularized and restricted to seed production areas to be approved by the
Research staff. Improved provenances and additional species required for
the research program would be imported.
3.26    At lower elevations most species would be grown as seedlings in
polythene tubes; but sissoo, however, would be planted as stumps and some
bamboo species as culms. In the Kashmir valley and at higher elevations
in Chenab naked rooted seedlings would be planted and poplar and willow
raised as naked rooted cuttings. Most planting stock (except fruit trees)
would be planted out at less than one year old.
Plantation Establishment
3.27    Fertilizer application at planting is not current practice but
would be a subject of the research program.
Plantation Maintenance
3.28    Tending operations would consist of replacement of casualties
(once only in the year after planting) and weeding round trees. For costs
see Project File, Item 1, Tables 1-9.
3.29    Weeding and working of the soil around the base of each tree would
generally be undertaken at most three times in the year of planting and
once or twice in the following four years. A particular feature of the
maintenance system would be that people living nearby would be encouraged
to remove the grass growing around trees for use as fodder thus performing
a valuable weeding function and reducing the fire risk.
Plantation Protection
3.30    All plantations require protection against insect attack, and
against grazing and fire. Protection against termites (at lower eleva-
tions) would be provided through the use of insecticides applied to the
soil of potted plants in the nursery in the field as necessary.
Throughout the State, the support for social forestry program appears to
be considerable and much communal responsibility for restraining grazing
animals can be expected, especially as cut fodder would be made freely
available to all. Wherever necessary brush fences of local materials



-22-
would be constructed usually for the psychological effect rather than as a
physical barrier to animals. In strip plantations some individual tree
protectors, using local material would be used sparingly, at a cost of Rs
1 per tree. Patrolling watchmen have been provided for whose respon-
sibility would cover from 2 ha (in the first year of narrow strip planta-
tions) to over 20 ha for large blocks of plantation in the plains and
hills.
Research
3.31    The project would provide for increased research and seed testing.
The research program would be under the direction of the Conservator in
charge of the Working and Research Circle and would be carried out by two
D.F.O.'s (Research) of the rank of DCF, one based at Srinagar and one at
Jammu. Field trials would be carried out at six field stations, each in
the charge of a research assistant. The six stations would be divided
equally between each D.F.O. Research, representative of the range of
environmental conditions to be found in the State.
3.32    Additional research staff and buildings would be provided through
the normal Forest Department budget but the project would provide addi-
tional funding required to meet additional research needed to support and
improve the social forestry program. The Additional Chief Conservator of
Forests in charge of the project would participate in formulating and
reviewing the Department's overall forest research program and would
thereby ensure that the research needs of social forestry are included.
3.33    The research program would include the following subjects:
(a) Nursery studies aimed at reducing costs of seedling production
through the introduction of techniques to produce better,
sturdier plants in a shorter time; and would include improved
soil mixtures and the use of fertilizers, pot size and spac-
ing, conditioning through root pruning and control of water-
ing, direct sowing into containers, the issue to farmers of
germinated seedlings for transplanting and of seeds for their
direct planting;
(b) Silviculture studies would be made on the effects of alternate
methods of pitting, fertilizing planting date, plant size,
pollarding and coppicing, rotation length and timing of opera-
tions on reducing establishment costs;
(c) Studies would be done on collection, handling, storage,
pretreatment and germination of tree seed; seed collection
areas would be identified and a reliable system of record
keeping at each seed godown would be developed;



-23-
(d) The growth performance of trees in strips as well as blocks
would be studied and spacing trials instituted;
(e) Intercropping trials studying the inter-relationships of trees
and fodder crops and also mixture of trees would be done to
measure the 3-dimensional effects of the model used;
(f) Although for the most part, the species proposed are well
proven and no major changes are expected during the life of
the project, some limited studies on species introduction and
provenance trials would be carried out using both fodder and
fuelwood species. These studies would determine the most
suitable provenance of the five most widely recommended
species and find viable alternatives, particulary for planting
in Kashmir; and
(g) Socio-economic studies would be carried out to determine
opportunity costs of farming and forestry, basic wood and
fodder needs and preferences, and development of different
species mixes. Such work would be instituted early in the
project and form a vital function in directing further techni-
cal research. A detailed research program is given in the
Project File, Item 4.
Project Implementation
3.34    The success of the proposed social forestry program will depend
largely upon an efficient organization having suitably trained and
equipped staff and acting in full cooperation with rural people. To
achieve these objectives, the project would strengthen SFW by the recruit-
ment of additional staff for forestry extension and the creation of two
special support units: one for public relations and the other to evaluate
project progress and impact (paras 3.43 and 3.44).
3.35    Annual planting targets (para 3.03) have been geared to the rate
at which SFW can recruit and train staff. Details of staff requirements
are given below and in Annex 1, Table 1.

1/ All staff assigned to SFW are incremental to the project. This
includes staff transferred from FD and staff to be recruited and
trained.
Housing and Transportation for Staff (SFW)
3.36    Much of the success of SFW's activities would depend on regular
and frequent visits by field staff to plantations, village panchayats and
individual farmers, all of which would be scattered over wide areas. It
is, therefore, vital that as far as possible field level staff and their
supervisors live near their work and that they are sufficiently mobile to
enable them to function effectively. At present, housing for rent in some
rural areas is limited and staff often live far from their work and rely
on public transport. To help overcome this, the project would construct
housing which would provide accomodation for 6% of forestry field staff.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that GOJAK would ensure that
field staff would live in the area assigned for their operations and for
this purpose would provide housing or rent allowance as necessary.
Designs would be in accordance with existing government standards which
apply to all Government departments.

Training
3.38    Project related training would be provided to an additional 150
Foresters, 245 Social Forestry Workers (SFW) and 1,400 Motivators as well
as to farmers and village leaders. All transferred Forest Department
staff would receive orientation training in social forestry and forestry
extension. This program cannot be accomodated within the existing train-
ing facilities which would be enlarged under the project by providing
additional buildings, equipment and staff.
Expansion of Kashmir Forest Training School, Chattarnar
3.39    The State has a 70-year-old institution located in the Kashmir
valley and providing training to Deputy Rangers/Foresters through a
one-year certificate course and to Forest Guards through a 3-month course.
The school can accomodate 72 students at a time and administers annually
one course for 40 Deputy Rangers/Foresters and two courses each for 32
Forest Guards. The project would enlarge the present facilities to
accomodate an additional 60 students.



-26-
Expansion of Soil Conservation School, Miran Sahib
3.40    The State also operates a 20-year-old institution near Jammu,
which provides in-service soil conservation training to Foresters through
a six-month course and basic training to Forest Guards training through a
three-month residential course. The school can accomodate 32 students at
a time and undertakes one soil conservation course for 32 Foresters and
two courses for 32 Forest Guards each year. The project would enlarge the
present facilities to accomodate an additional 60 students.
3.41    Each school would be expanded by constructing additional class-
rooms (2), dining hall and kitchen, dormitory blocks (2) ablutions, staff
rooms (2) and staff housing (2) at a total cost of Rs 1.8 M. One truck
and one bus would be provided for each school, as well as the necessary
furniture and equipment. Design of buildings for both schools would be in
accordance with existing government standards for similar buildings con-
structed elsewhere and which apply to all government departments.
3.42    Staffing levels would be raised by providing at each school two
additional instructors at the Forest Ranger level. In addition, two
locally engaged consultants in communication and extension would be
provided for a two year period at each school to plan and carry out the
program for extension training. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that the four locally engaged teaching consultants would be appointed not
later than June 30, 1983.
Publicity Units
3.43    Two Publicity Units would be established and each attached to a
Forestry Circle. Additionally, each Division (there are a total of 10
Divisions) would employ a Divisional Publicity Officer (DPO) to coordinate
all activities associated with publicity and dissemination of information
in his Division. Under the project, funds would be provided for addi-
tional staff, equipment and materials to support DPO in their work.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the two Publicity Officers
heading the Publicity Units would be appointed not later than December 31,
1983.
Monitoring and Evaluation
3.44    The Project would provide funds to establish a Monitoring and
Evaluation Unit (MEU) headed by a DCF and supported by statistical staff
and field enumerators. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the
Unit would be established not later than December 31, 1982. The unit
would, in the light of experience and data collected, suggest improvements
for project implementation, assess villagers' acceptance of social
forestry activities, determine tree survival rates of the farm forestry



-27-
component and carry out a mid-term evaluation of the project. The unit
would produce six monthly progress reports, each June and December in a
format agreed at negotiations and, giving details of staffing in each
field unit and at headquarters; a summary of activities undertaken during
the preceding six months; and targets achieved and problems encountered
during project implementation. Funds would also be provided for a locally
recruited consultant to advise on the design of survey studies and assist
in setting up systems for project monitoring. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that the DCF in charge of the MEU and the consultant to the
MEU would be appointed not later than June 30, 1983.
Wood-Balance Study
3.45    No reliable information exists on the consumption and availability
of fuelwood and other forest-based products in the rural and urban areas
of India. This information is a prerequisite for more efficient forest
development planning. A Wood-Balance study would be carried out in the
State by the University of Jammu and Kashmir or any other appropriate
institution The cost of the study is estimated to be Rs. 1 M (US$
117,000). An outline of the proposed terms of reference of the proposed
study is given in Item 5 of the Project File and these was agreed upon
during negotiations.
External Fellowships
3.46    Fourteen 8-week overseas fellowships would be provided for senior
SFW staff in management and forestry extension. Total cost is estimated
to be US$ 200,000.
Consultants
3.47    One hundred twenty manmonths of local consultancy time have been
provided in the fields of monitoring and evaluation, communication and
extension for staff at the schools at Chattarnar and Miran Sahib. Total
cost is estimated to be Rs. 528,000 (US$ 62,117).

IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Social Forestry Wing
4.01    JAK has established a SFW in its FD.  To handle the increased
administrative responsibility, an Additional CCF has been appointed and is
directly responsible to CCF for all social forestry affairs. To cope with
increased planting and maintenance programs, two social forestry Circles,
covering a total of ten field Divisions, have been established. Each
Circle would be headed by a Conservator of Forests. Each Division would
be headed by a DCF and assisted by an Asst. CF. The ten Divisions would
cover all the State's 12 districts, i.e., one Division may cover more than
one district depending on the size of the forestry program to be imple-
mented. Each Division would be staffed by 3 Rangers (each covering 1,400
ha of forest) who would supervise subordinate staff and be technically
responsible for establishment of forest plantations. In addition, in each
unit 15 Foresters (each covering 300 ha) would supervise the physical
implementation of the plantation program and each Forester would be
assisted by 1-2 Social Forestry Workers (each covering about 190 ha) and 9
Motivators (each covering 30 ha). A determined effort would be made by
SFW to recruit and train women Motivators.
4.02    The expansion of the State's social forestry program and the
establishment of a Social Forestry Wing would require two new cadres of
field staff to undertake extension activities at the village and farmer
level. Firstly, Social Forestry Workers (SFW) would be largely recruited
from outside the Forestry Service and would have completed their secondary
school education. In addition, they would be given 13 weeks of training in
forestry and extension methods which would be supplemented by monthly
orientation training given at the Divisional level by the DFO or the ACF. 1/
SFW would encourage village panchayats and farmers to participate in the
forestry program by explaining to them the benefits to be derived. In
addition, SFW would supervise planting and forest protection and visit
village Motivators at least twice a month to supervise their work and
solve problems arising from project implementation. Village Motivators 2/
would be based at the village level and would be recruited either from
among progressive farmers or their wives and from village panchayat mem-
bers. Motivators would be given a five-week training (see Item 9 of
Project File) in simple communication and extension techniques and a
comprehensive orientation on the project and its objectives. Basic train-
ing of Motivators would be given at the Divisional level by the DFO or ACF
and would be supplemented by monthly orientation in-service training.
Motivators would assist in coordinating operations in village woodlot

File.
2/ 1,400 Motivators would be recruited, 1 Motivator per Village
Panchayat.

establishment, private forestry and strip planting. However, the main
function of the Motivator would be to promote farm forestry schemes. They
would explain to farmers the benefits they would derive from the estab-
lishment of private plantations and keep records of individual plantings.
Motivators would visit farmers (individually or in groups) at least once a
month to discuss problems that may arise. If these cannot be solved
satisfactorily the problem(s) would be referred to the SFW or raised at
the monthly orientation divisional meeting. In addition, they would carry
out simple administrative activities such as monitoring of survival rate
of trees, recording research trials at the village and farmer's level and
provide the linkage between the SFW and the village panchayat and farmer.
Motivators would be employed part-time and receive an honorarium of Rs.
2,400 per annum. 1/
4.03    Each Division would be staffed by a Divisional Publicity Officer
(DPO) who would coordinate all publicity and communication activities in
his area and be directly responsible to PO in his circle. Research would
be undertaken by existing research units each headed by a DCF. A monitor-
ing and evaluation unit (para 3.44) would be established and headed by a
DCF.
Project Coordination
4.04    Coordination of social forestry activities with programs of other
government agencies at State and District levels would be achieved through
two committees described below:
(a)  The State Policy Review Committee would meet as often as necessary
but not less than once a year and would be chaired by the Chief Minister.
Among its members would be the Minister of Forests; Minister of Planning
and Finance; Secretary, Department of Forests; Secretary, Department of
Agriculture; Secretary, Department of Panchayats; Land Reforms Commis-
sioner; Labor Commissioner; Chief Engineer, Public Works Department; Chief
Engineer, Irrigation; Chief Conservator of Forests; Addl. Chief Conser-
vator of Forests, Social Forestry; General Manager, North Western Railway;
Regional Director, Social Forestry, Jammu and Regional Director, Social
Forestry, Srinagar.
1/ Although the project has budgeted for 1,400 motivators (one for each
village panchayat), the number of motivators recruited would depend on
the size and concentration of plantations. A larger concentration of
plantations would require fewer Motivators.



-30-
(b) The District Policy Review Committee would meet at least once
every four months and would be chaired by the District Development Commis-
sioner. Among its members would be the Assistant Commissioner, Develop-
ment; Superintendent Engineer of the District; Development Manager of
Railways (where appropriate); District Panchayat Officer; elected members
of the District Development Boards and Divisional Forest Officers of SFW.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the State and District
Review Committees would be established not later than December 31, 1982.
Provision of Training Facilities for Social Forestry Workers and
Motivators
4.05    Social Forestry Workers would be trained at either of the two
expanded training schools (para 3.39 and 3.40). Most candidates would be
recruited from outside the forestry service, though some candidates would
be recruited from amongst serving forest guards. Training in basic con-
cepts of forestry would be given by existing FD instructors and training
in communication and extension by locally recruited consultants (para
3.42). The training of SFW would last 3 months and would be supplemented
by additional one-day monthly orientation training given at Divisional
level (para 4.07). An outline of the training curriculum is given in the
Project File, Item 6.
4.06    Motivators would be trained at Divisional level in small training
centers, one for each Division, (each costing Rs 120,000) constructed
under the project. Candidates would be recruited from among progressive
farmers or their wives or village panchayat members. Each DCF would
organize five-week courses which would be supplemented by regular one-day
monthly orientation training (para 4.07). Provision has been made under
the project for the recruitment of a communication and extension consult-
ant to help organize short training courses run by DCF and other senior
SFW staff and help to help to design extension programs at the Divisional
level. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Communication
and Extension Consultant would be appointed not later than June 30, 1983.
An outline of the curriculum for Motivator training is given in the
Project File, Item 7.
4.07    Orientation training would be given to Motivators, SFW, Deputy
Rangers and Foresters. One-day training sessions (held monthly) would be
given at the Divisional level by the DCF or Asst. CF to approximately 150
field staff from the division. These sessions would concentrate on prac-
tical application of knowledge gained, group discussion and problems
encountered in project implementation.

V. BACKGROUND: HARYANA
A. The State of Haryana
General
5.01    The State of Haryana, with an area of 44,040 km2, has a population
of about 13.0 M (1981), of which, 82% live in rural areas. Since its
formation (1966), the State has made excellent progress in increasing
agricultural production which plays a predominant role in the State's
economy, accounting for 54% of its income and 65% of its employment. An
industrial complex has recently been established in Faridabad where medium
and small scale industries produce agricultural machinery and electrical
goods.
5.02    Population density averages 292 persons per km2, but there is   2
considerable inter-district variation, ranging from a high of 469 per km
in Faridabad District near Delhi, to a low 166 per km2 in Sirsa District
in the western corner of the State. A little less than 19% of the popula-
tion belongs to scheduled castes (IBRD map 16199).
5.03    The rural population is spread over 6,731 villages, each with an
average population of about 1,572. Ecological differences and
socio-cultural factors influence variations in the incidence of poverty
between regions and different segments of the population. Nearly half of
the rural population was below the poverty line in 1981 1/ In the village,
traditional patron-client relationships between castes are slowly being
replaced by a monetary economy and many services are today paid for in
cash. Farms in general are small, with 62% of all holdings less than 3
ha. Details are given in Annex 14.
5.04    Livestock forms an integral part of village life; a household
possesses, on average, 5 heads of livestock which provide milk, draught
power, manure and dung cake for cooking. Livestock generally graze on
panchayat owned lands that surround villages, and their feed is supple-
mented with agricultural products and tree loppings.
5.05    Population pressures and the increase in livestock numbers (of
which there are an estimated 7M) necessitate the continual search for
food, fuel and fodder. This has resulted in indiscriminate tree-cutting
and increasing erosion, particularly in the Siwalik hills in Ambala Dis-
trict.
1/ Poverty line estimated at US$114.00 per capita per annum.



-32-
Panchayat System
5.06    Village panchayats were first constituted in Haryana (then part of
the Punjab Province) in 1939. These panchayats were reconstituted with
the passage of the Punjab Gram Panchayats Act, 1952, which is still in
force in the State. Panchayat Samitis (sub-district associations) and
Zilla Parishads (District Assemblies) were constituted under legislation
passed in 1964. The State had a three-tier system of panchayats with the
village (gram) panchayat at the lowest level, the Panchayat Samiti at the
intermediate level, and the Zilla Parishad at the apex. The village
panchayat is a corporate body elected by the residents of a village (a
village corresponding with a revenue village, or mauza). In 1973, Zilla
Parishads were abolished and the functions of these assemblies have now
been taken over by the line departments of government. Panchayat Samitis
have also ceased to exist after the tenure of office of their members
ended in 1977.
5.07    There is a wide range of activities that village panchayats can
undertake. Most importantly for the project, the obligatory functions of
a panchayat include the planting and preservation of trees on village
common land. Government is also empowered to transfer the maintenance and
management of forests and government waste lands within or near the bound-
aries of a panchayat. The functions of Panchayat Samitis are now exer-
cised by a Block Committee consisting of the Additional Deputy Commis-
sioner, the Sub-divisional Magistrate, and the Block Development and
Panchayat Officer all of whom are government officials. There are 5,250
panchayats each comprising about 1,900 people.
5.08    The State provides both administrative and financial assistance to
panchayats. Under the former category, the gram sachiv (village assis-
tant) acts as panchayat secretary. Further assistance is provided at the
Block (sub-district) level by the Block Committee. At the State level,
village panchayats are under the administrative control of the Development
Department. Financial assistance is provided both in the form of grants
for regular expenses (for administration) and for special works. A vil-
lage panchayat also raises funds directly through house taxes and annual
auctions of cultivable common land. The average annual income of a
panchayat is about Rs 13,300 (approx. US$1,565). All income of a
panchayat has to be deposited in a scheduled bank and accounts are audited
annually by the Development Department and the State Auditor General.
5.09    Panchayat owned plantations have already been established and
financed by the Forest Department (FD) on nearly 12,000 ha of land since
1977. Although this past FD practice may have been necessary to demon-
strate the best use of waste lands, it has had a remarkable effect on
those panchayats which have not received FD assistance and are now willing



-33-
to develop plantations on degraded and uncultivable lands. This is par-
ticularly the case in the southern districts of the State where most
agriculturalists are faced with the problem of shifting sand dunes. The
State Government and FD now recognize that establishment costs of
panchayat forests must be recovered and that in future FD would recover
its direct costs from the sale of harvestable produce (paras 6.05 and
6.12). For further details on panchayat organization see Item 8 of the
Project File.
Present Consumption of Energy
5.10    Haryana's domestic energy requirement, as in Jammu and Kashmir, is
primarily met by use of wood and dung cake as fuel. Given that incomes
in Haryana are somewhat higher than in most States in India, the annual
requirements met from non-renewable energy sources has now reached 5% or
0.5 M tons FWE. All rural villages in Haryana are now electrified, but
the relatively high cost of electricity, bottled gas, coal, kerosene, etc.
preclude rapid increases in their use as a source of domestic fuel.
Present average daily household consumption is about 20 kgs. of fuelwood
giving an annual per capita requirement of 1.0 ton FWE. Based on these
estimates, total annual domestic energy consumption is approximately 12 M
tons FWE, or 11.5 M tons FWE from renewable sources.
5.11    Of the energy required to meet present day demands, the mission
estimates that 75% of cow dung produced is burned, most of which is col-
lected and processed by women. Thus about 30% of domestic energy consump-
tion is provided from dung cake, and the remaining 70% from fuelwood.
This figure equates with the all India estimate that 73 million out of 100
million tons of dung produced annually is burned as fuel. 1/ The 11.5 M
tons FWE is estimated to be derived from:
Amount 1/              FWE 1/           %
Fuelwood and Charcoal            8 M tons              8 M tons         70
Dung Cake                        8.2 M tons            3.5 M tons       30
Thus 1.6 M ha of tree plantations would be required (assuming a mean
annual increment of 7 tons per ha) to meet present domestic fuel require-
ments. Given the overall paucity of data on present energy consumption
patterns in Haryana (and JAK), a study would be carried out to estimate
more accurately energy consumption and its production (para 6.40).

B. Forestry in Haryana
5.12    A large part of Haryana is situated on the Indo-Gangetic plain at
an elevation of about 300 meters above sea level. These central plains
contain substantial tracts of saline and alkaline soils which are almost
totally unproductive and merge into near desert conditions prevailing in
the south west of the State and characterized by the presence of numerous
low sand ridges and shifting sand dunes. The low Aravalli hills of
igneous rock break the plains to the south west of Delhi, while the steep
Siwalik Hills of friable sandstone located along the State boundary in the
north east, rise to 1,500 meters. There are no rivers of major importance
except the Jamuna which forms the eastern boundary of the State.
5.13    In all parts of the State,  The seasons are winter (November to
January), summer (February to May) and monsoon (June to October). Summer
temperatures rise to 47C and winter temperatures fall to 00 with a high
diurnal range in the south. Frost is common in the drier areas and hail
storms may occur in April-May. Annual rainfall varies from about 1100 mm
in the north to 400 mm in the south, about half the State receiving less
than 600 mm rainfall and becomes progressively less reliable in the south
where it occurs for only a few days each year. There is normally a
5-month dry season from December to April and 60 to 70% of total rainfall
occurs during June to August, (IBRD Map 16198).
5.14    The forests are wholly owned by the State and are under the
management of the Forest Department. The total forest area of the State
is 0.16 M ha (including 0.03 M ha on non-State land) and covers
approximately 3.3% of the total geographical area. In addition, it has
been estimated that a substantial part of the State's 0.25 M ha of waste
and eroded agricultural lands would be suitable for afforestation. Of the
forest area, 42% is in Ambala District in the north, which includes the
Siwalik Hills, while the remaining districts have only from I to 5% of
their land surface under forest. Of the 0.04 M ha of natural forest, 65%
is degraded with scattered trees and 35% is well stocked. There are 0.06
M ha of man made plantations and 0.06 M ha of land under protection await-
ing planting. Productivity of the plantations is high while that of the
natural forest is low. While an understanding of forest conservation is
generally lacking in many sections of the community, the FD has been able
to establish and sucessfully protect a large area of scattered plantations
on both State and private land.
Contribution of Forests to the Economy
5.15    Contribution of the forestry sector to State income was estimated
in 1979 Rs 26 M or 1% out of a total of Rs 21,635 M. In 1973-80, the
recorded average annyal production from the State forests was 53,940 m3 of
timber and 119.397 m of fuelwood. In addition, a wide variety of minor
forest products were extracted, including bamboo, gums, fruits and fodder.



-35-
The State has a number of forest-based industries: 2 pulp and paper mills,
some 800 sawmills, 87 box maufacturing units, 488 furniture production
units and 17 small-scale match manufacturing units. These units rely
largely on imported timber from other States. There is also one manufac-
turing unit which produces khair. 1/ No reliable estimates are available
for the total number of people employed in forest based industries,
however, the pulp and paper mills provide full time employment to some
5,000 people.
5.16    Existing forests provide benefits to marginal farmers and landless
laborers, (who form the bulk of the population in and around the forests),
in the form of free fuelwood, fruit, flowers, fodder and grazing. Employ-
ment in forest areas also provides the main source of earnings to these
people. In 1980/81, primary forest productions generated some 7.61 M man
days of employment.
5.17    Shortages of primary forest products, especially fuelwood, build-
ing poles and fodder are becoming increasingly severe and are likely to
worsen in the near future. Although present tree-planting activities will
help alleviate the situation, the magnitude of the problem and the lop-
sided geographic distribution of existing forest resources are such that
the long-term solution lies in the afforestation of new areas. Presently,
many areas such as road, rail and canal reserves, and other wastelands
that could grow trees, are unproductive.
Forestry Institutions
5.18    The Head of the Haryana Forest Department is the Chief Conservator
of Forests (CCF). He is supported at Headquarters by one Additional CCF
(Addl. CCF) who is also the State Chief Wild Life Warden. At field level
there are two operational circles, each headed by a Conservator of Forests
(CF). Each of these circles is responsible for 6-7 Divisions (a total of
13 Divisions). Each Division is headed by a Divisional Forest Officer
(DFO), who is usually a DCF and is assisted by an Assistant Conservator of
Forests (ACF). Within a Division there are 4 to 5 Range Offices, each
staffed by a Forest Ranger (FR) who is responsible for all technical
matters related to forests in his designated area. Each FR covers 3 to 4
Blocks, each of which is staffed by a Deputy Ranger or Forester who is
responsible for all forestry activites within his Block and the supervi-
sion of 4 to 6 Forest Guards (FG) employed to protect the forests.
Directly responsible to the Addl. CCF are 3 DFO's in-charge of Timber
Extraction Divisions and 3 DFO's in-charge of Working Plans, Research and
Training and Wild Life Preservation.

-36-
5.19    Indian Forest Service Officers (professional), State Forest
Officers and Range Officers are trained by the Central Government (para
2.34). Foresters are trained at a one-year course given at the Forester
Training School at Pinjore in Haryana State. Forest Guards are recruited
from secondary school leavers and are also trained at Pinjore.
Forestry Program
5.20    The State has primarily depended on man made forests and the
achievements so far have been quite impressive. At the end of 1980, the
total area of forest plantations in the State was 83,272 ha. This repre-
sents nearly 51% of the State's total forest area, which is much higher
than the all India average of 4.8%. In the 6th Plan, Rs 145 M have been
allocated to forest development, or 0.8% of the State's total budget.
Social Forestry
5.21    Social forestry activities have been undertaken in the State since
the late 1960's. So far, about 62% of the land available along roads,
rails and canals have been planted to trees. Wastelands belonging to
panchayats have also been planted to trees. At the end of 1980, the total
area of plantations was:
Achievement (ha)
Strip Plantations                             44,072
Farm Forestry                                 18,000
Village Woodlots                              17,000
Sand Dune Stabilization                        3,500
(individual and communal plantations)
Plantations on Institutional Lands               700
83,272
5.22    Although Haryana's planting achievements have been most impressive,
the Forestry Department (FD) had adopted a paternalistic approach to tree
planting where all plantations on village and private wastelands were
undertaken by the FD without any participation by farmers or village
panchayats (para 5.09). Under the proposed project provision has been made
for the establishment of a forestry extension service (para 7.02) and for
farmers and village panchayats to participate in the protection, maintenance
and financial cost of the establishment of private and village woodlots.
5.23    Under the supervision of forestry staff, the rural population
living alongside strip plantations collect grass, fallen wood and tree
loppings. Similarly, where village woodlots have been established, the
local population collects intermediate yields estimated at 5-7 tons per ha.
At harvest time, the village panchayat generates income from the sale of
timber or poles from its plantations to finance village public works (paras
6.05 and 6.11).

VI. SUB-PROJECT: HARYANA
A. General
6.01    The project's primary objectives would be to increase supplies of
fuelwood to rural areas through the establishment of 67,000 ha of planta-
tions located in all 12 districts of the State. Secondary objectives
would be to provide poles, small timber, fodder grass, fruits, oilseeds
and other minor products. In order to carry out this program the project
will provide training facilities, vehicles, housing, equipment and addi-
tional staff for research and extension activities. The project would
also result in considerable seasonal employment, estimated at 17 M man
days 1/ and create 1,420 permanent jobs over five years.
General Description
6.02    During a five-year period the project would:
(a) establish 12,000 ha of village woodlots;
(b) establish 500 ha of plantations on Alkali lands;
(c) establish 9,500 ha of strip plantings along roads,
canals and railroads;
(d) establish 30,000 ha of farm forestry on private land;
(e) establish 15,000 ha of plantations on sand dunes;
(f) establish additional nurseries to provide planting stock;
(g) expand the existing Forester/tree seed Guard school:
(h) provide forestry staff at the operational and extension
levels, including staff to support publicity, research,
training and monitoring activities;
(i) strengthen research activities, and construct s7'eed storage
godowns;
(j) develop training of project staff including provision of
fellowships; and
(k) carry out a wood balance study.
1/ Equivalent to Rs 136 M (US$16 M)in the form of wages for unskilled
labor.

Prime responsibility for implementation would be with the Social Forestry
Wing (SFW) of the Forestry Department.

a/   Categories of plantations contain various models and species to suit
varying climatic conditions (Project File, Item 9, Tables 1-9).
b/   Because this is a somewhat innovative approach and it is impossible to
predict with certainly Panchayats and farmers' response to alternative
approaches to social forestry, flexibility would be maintained during
project implementation and would allow shifting from one category to
another according to results. This would be accomplished by monitoring
the results (para 6.41) and by a joint GOH/IDA review in project year 3.
B. Detailed Features
6.04    All five categories of plantations (village woodlots, strip plan-
tations sand dune stabilization, afforestation of eroded agricultural
lands, wastelands and alkali lands) have differing conceptual, estab-
lishment, management, harvesting, marketing, legal and funding features
which distinguish them from one another. Details of each category are
summarized in the following paragraphs.
6.05    Village Woodlots (12,000 ha representing 18% of total planting
program). Social Forestry Wing (SFW) would establish a minimum of 5 ha
of plantation per village panchayat and maintain the village plantation
for a period of 5 years, employing labor from the concerned panchayat.
Cost of planting, maintenance and protection would be borne by the SFW for
the first 3 years but the local population would assist in the protection



-39-
of the plantation.   Thereafter, management and protection of the planta-
tion would be with the responsibility of the village panchayat. At the
first major harvest, SFW would recover its direct costs from the sale of
firewood, timber, or poles and the cash balance would be given to the
panchayat. The panchayat would utilize the funds either for financing
public works in the village (such as the construction of a water supply,
or village road), or to finance the establishment of additional village
woodlots. Villagers would collect fallen wood and tree loppings for
fodder which is estimated to reach an annual production of 5-7 tons of
fuelwood per ha from the 5th year onwards, depending on the species
planted.
6.06    Village woodlots would be mostly established in the southern
districts where there are large areas of village common lands and waste-
lands which can be utilized for tree planting. Social Forestry Wing would
provide seedlings free of charge for all categories of plantations.
Operating Procedures
6.07    SFW, acting through its field staff would encourage villages to
establish village woodlots by explaining the benefits to be obtained from
communal plantations and by assisting the panchayat in demarcating areas
of waste land which can be planted to trees. Furthermore, SFW would
explain the nature and provisions of the agreement to be entered into
between the panchayat and SFW (Item 10 in Project File). Agreement was
reached during negotiations on the nature and provisions of the model
contract.
6.08    Once proposals have been agreed upon, village panchayat would be
assisted with implementation through regular visits from Village Forestry
Workers (VFW) (para 7.05). VFW would develop the villagers' skills and
understanding of forestry through these visits, increased publicity
(films, posters, talks) and by organizing one-day visits of groups of
villagers to demonstration areas where panchayats or farmers have
developed their own plantations. In addition, groups of progressive
farmers and village panchayat committees would participate in monthly
one-day orientation training organized by the Deputy Conservator of
Forests and Asst. Conservator of Forests at the district level.
6.09    Strip Plantations (9,500 ha representing 14% of total planting
Program). SFW would establish plantations alongside roads, canals and
railways. Villagers who live close to these plantations would be able
to collect free of cost grass, fodder, fallen wood and tree loppings for
fodder under the general supervision of forestry staff. In return, they
would assist project field staff in protecting these plantations. This
form of cooperation between the local population and forestry staff for
the protection of strip plantations and sharing of benefits has been in
practice for the past two decades in all States in India. Generally,



-40-
strip plantations are not protected with barbed wire fencing but with the
cooperation of the local population.
6.10    Farm Forestry (30,000 ha representing 45% of total planting
program). SWF would distribute 75 M seedlings free of cost (approximately
2,500 seedlings per ha) to farmers to plant on private owned waste lands
and field boundaries. Deputy Conservator of Forests would ensure that
some 50% of seedlings would be distributed to small farmers with holdings
of 3 ha or less. Funds would be provided under the project to transport
these seedlings to distribution points in village panchayats. Unlike JAK
State (where 85% of land holdings are 3 ha or less), in Haryana State
nearly 40% of land holdings are 3 ha or more (Annex 13 and 14).
6.11    Sand Dune Stabilization (15,000 ha representing 22% of total
planting program. SFW would establish and maintain plantations on
individual or panchayat owned land. Costs for the first 5 years would be
borne by the SFW. Thereafter, management and protection of the plantation
would be the responsibility of the village panchayat or individual
farmers. SFW would recover its direct costs from the sale of harvestable
forest products and the cash balance would be given to the owners of the
plantation. In the case of village panchayats, panchayats would utilize
the funds to finance public works in the village, or establish additional
village woodlots. In the case of individual ownership, farmers could
either establish additional private woodlots or finance improvements on
their land. Villagers would be able to collect fallen wood and tree
loppings from village woodlots.
6.12    SFW would establish, as far as possible, a minimum of 15 ha of
plantation for each woodlot to protect adjacent agricultural lands. In
addition, since water is generally not available on these sites, SFW would
transport water by carrier. It is estimated that there are approximately
600,000 ha of sand dunes in the State which cause serious damage to arable
land and canals through wind erosion. Thus, the benefits from sand dune
stablization would be substantial since they extend beyond the production
of fuelwood and small timber. Provisions of the agreement to be entered
into between the individual and SFW are given in Item 11 of the Project
File. Agreement was reached during negotiations on the nature and provi-
sions of the model contract.
6.13    Alkali/Saline Lands (500 ha representing 1% of total planting
program). SFW would establish, maintain and protect plantations on alkali
lands. Since this component is of a pilot nature, SFW would bear all
plantation costs. These plantations would be carefully monitored by the
Central Soil Salinity Research Institute (CSSRI) located at Karnal. Funds
would also be provided under the project for three research fellowships
and costs of materials and equipment for establishing field trials and
monitoring of results (para 6.30 (f)).



-41-
Plantation Design and Establishment
6.14    Overall 98% of all trees planted would produce fuelwood and/or
small timber. Many of the recommended species also produce good leaf
fodder and the production of naturally-occuring grasses would be enhanced
by protection of plantations from uncontrolled grazing.  Although many
items would be produced, the main emphasis is on fuelwood and small timber
production.  Fruit trees are a small component in many models.
6.15    Although many of the species are indigenous to India, 68% of the
planting would be of exotics species which are well naturalized and known
to FD.  The range of species recommended is wide and covers many ecologi-
cal conditions. Decisions on the species mix would be made locally after
considering the objectives of the plantations and the needs of the
locality. The project would provide funds for the construction of ten
seed godowns, one for each Division and Circle.
6.16    Nine plantation models have been developed to meet the different
objectives and site conditions of the State. Many more variations for
subsites are possible, but in general all are rainfed, although limited
watering using local resources or with the assistance of tractor and water
carrier is proposed. Details are given in Item 9, Tables 1-9 of the
Project File.
6.17    In strip plantations fuelwood and pole species predominate, with
ornamental and shade trees included along roads.
6.18    In village woodlots fuelwood/pole species represent 31% of the
trees planted; timber/fuelwood species 68% and fruit trees 1% (generally
planted along the periphery of the plantations). In farm forestry the
proportions are 97% and 3% respectively, and narrow crowned species will
be preferred in order to limit the shading effect. On alkali lands and
sand dunes the emphasis is on fuelwood/timber species but with 20% being
devoted to fuelwood/pole species on alkali land and an initial intercrop
of castor and kana grass being grown on sand dunes.

a/ Expenditures incurred during the first five years, including nursery,
advance soil works, establishment, maintenance and protection. On
average, labor costs represent 81% of total planting expenditures
(Project File, Item 9, Tables 1-9).
Planting Programs
6.20    Annual planting program would be agreed at State and district
committee meetings (see para 7.04 for constitution of these committees).
Planting sites would be selected and surveyed during the winter months
and pitting and other advance soil and protective works carried out there-
after and in time for the planting season. Pitting would be standard
practice. On wet sites raised ridges for planting would be either 1 m
wide at 4 m spacing or 2 m wide at 8 m spacing for planting at 1 1/2 m
intervals. Planting holes on alkali lands would be dug by tractor-mounted
post hole augur to ensure reaching a depth of 1.5 - 1.8 which is beyond
the level of the calcareous pan. Potted seedlings for the current year's
planting would be transported to the site at the onset of the monsoon in
late June/early July. Provision is made for the transport of plants but
it is estimated that 50% of plants for farm forestry would be transported
by the beneficiaries.
Nurseries
6.21    At present there are 70 permanent and 349 temporary nurseries in
the State available for social forestry activities. It is proposed to
establish at least one permanent nursery in each Administrative Block, 1/
1/ There are 92 Administrative Blocks.



-43-
but temporary nurseries would be established as and when required. Nur-
series would be sited close to a permanent water source, usually using
water pumped from a neighboring farmer. Where necessary permanent nur-
series would be equipped with pump and sprinkler. Permanent nurseries
would be in charge of a Forester, temporary ones under the control of the
Village Forestry Worker (VFW).
6.22    Most tree seeds would be collected locally and stored and tested
at the seed godown to be located in each Division. Local seed collection
would be regularized and restricted as soon as possible to seed areas
approved by Research staff. Seed of improved provenances and for addi-
tional species required for the research program would need to be
imported.
6.23    Most species planted would be from seedlings grown in polythene
tubes, but sissoo and siris would be established from stumped seedlings.
Most planting stock would be planted out at less than one year old. In
sand dunes Castor would be sown direct and kana grass planted as rhizomes.
Plantation Establishment
6.24    In order to ensure high survival and growth rates, chemical fer-
tilizer would be applied to the planting site of most plantation models.
Planting holes on alkali land would be refilled with the original soil
mixed with 3 kg gypsum and 8 kg farmyard manure. The clean weeding of
sand dunes is essential to reduce competition for available moisture and
to ensure successful establishment.
Plantation Maintenance
6.25    Tending operations would consist of replacement of casualties
(once or twice after planting) and weeding round the trees. For costs
see Project File, Item 9, Tables 1-9.
6.26    Weeding and soil working around the base of each tree would
generally be undertaken at most three times in the year of planting and
once or twice in the following four years. A particular feature of the
maintenance systems used would be that local people or private owners
would be encouraged to cut and remove grass and herbaceous fodder from
plantations thus performing a valuable weeding function and reducing the
dry season fire risk. The trees themselves would also suppress much of
the weed growth as they close canopy.
Plant Protection
6.27    All plantations require protection against insect attack, and
against grazing and fire. Protection against termites would be provided
through the use of insecticides applied to the soil of potted plants in



-44-
the nursery in the month before planting. Throughout the State, however,
the support for social forestry appears to be considerable and much com-
munal responsibility for restraining grazing animals can be expected,
especially as cut fodder will be made freely available to all. Fences
would be used, more for the psychological effect than as a physical bar-
rier around 10% of the strip plantations. In isolated cases, individual
tree protectors, made from local material, would also be used sparingly,
at a cost of Rs 1 per tree. Boundary trenches, costing an average of some
Rs 100 per ha would be used in some village plantations including those on
alkali land and sand dunes and would be reinforced by the establishment of
live hedging. Patrolling watchmen would also be employed and would cover
from 5 ha (in the case of narrow strip plantations) to over 20 ha for
large blocks of plantations.
Research
6.28    The project would provide for increased research and seed testing.
The research program would be carried out by existing research staff under
the D.F.0. (Research) of the rank of DCF.
6.29    Funding of research staff and buildings would be through the
normal Forest Department budget but the project would provide for the
costs of additional research needed to support and improve the social
forestry program. The Chief Conservator of Forests, in charge of the
project would participate in formulating and reviewing the Department's
overall forest research program and would thereby ensure that the research
needs of social forestry are provided for.
6.30    The research program would include the following subjects:
(a) Nursery studies would aim at reducing costs through the intro-
duction of techniques to produce better, sturdier plants in a
shorter time, and would include work on alternate soil mix-
tures and the use of fertilizers, pot size and spacing, con-
ditioning through root pruning and control of watering, direct
sowing into containers, the timing of operations and, the
issue to farmers of germinated seedlings for transplanting and
of seeds for their direct planting;
(b) Silviculture studies would be made on optimizing pitting,
fertilizing, planting date, plant size, pollarding and coppic-
ing, rotation length and the timing of operations, all with
the objective of reducing costs but retaining and increasing
performance;
(c) Studies would be done on collection, handling, storage,
pretreatment and germination of tree seed;



-45-
(d) The growth performance of trees in strips as well as blocks
would be studied and spacing trials instituted;
(e) Intercropping trials studying inter-relationships of trees
and fodder crops and also mixtures of trees would be initiated
to evaluate the 3-dimensional effects of models used;
(f) Alkali land research would be extended into large scale field
trials and which would be designed and monitored with the
assistance of three research fellowships;
(g) Although for the most part, the species proposed are socially
acceptable and no major changes in them are expected during
the life of the project, some limited studies on species
introduction and provenance trials would be carried out with
fodder and fuelwood species. These would determine the most
suitable provenance of the five major species grown and would
enable the finding of viable alternatives for the drier parts
of the State;
(h) Socio-economic studies on the opportunity costs of farming
and forestry, on basic wood and fodder needs and preferences
and on the development of different species mixes would be
instituted early in the project and form a vital function in
directing further technical research. Two fellowships would
be provided in agro-forestry studies at Hissar Agricultural
University. A detailed research program is given in the
Project File, Item 12.
Project Implementation
6.31    The success of the proposed social forestry program would depend
largely upon an efficient organization with suitably trained and equipped
staff acting in full cooperation with rural people. To achieve these
objectives, the project would strengthen SFW by the recruitment of addi-
tional staff for forestry extension and the creation of two special sup-
port units: public relations and project monitoring and evaluation (paras
6.38 and 6.39).
6.32    Annual planting targets (para 6.03) have been geared to the rate
at which SFW can recruit and train staff. Details of staff requirements
are given below and in Annex 1, Table 7:

and frequent visits by field staff to village panchayats and individual
farmers both of which would be scattered over a wide area. Housing would
be provided under the project for Deputy Conservator of Forests and
Rangers totalling 40 units. Other field staff staff would be provided
with rented accomodation or a rental allowance. Design standards and cost
estimates of housing for field staff would be on average about Rs 86,500

would live in the area assigned for their operations and for this purpose
would provide housing or rent allowance as necessary.

Training
6.35    Training would be provided for an additional 150 foresters and 766
VFW as well as for farmers and village leaders, and all existing Forest
Department staff would receive orientation training in social forestry and
forestry extension work. This program cannot be accommodated within the
existing training facilities and which would be enlarged by providing
additional buildings, equipment and staff.
6.36    The State has a 23-year-old institution at Pinjore giving training
to Deputy Rangers/Foresters through a ten month certificate course and
to Forest Guards through a 5 1/2 month course. The school can accommodate
80 students at a time and and has an annual output of 40 Foresters in one
course and two courses for 100 Forest Guards. The project would enlarge
the present facilities to accommdate an additional 60 students. The
school is in a very dilapidated condition and funds would be provided
under the project to renovate existing buildings and construct additional
dormitories including a women's dormitory and staff accommodation. One
truck and one bus would be provided as well as the necessary furniture and
equipment. Design of buildings would be in accordance with existing
government standards for similar buildings and which apply to all govern-
ment departments.
6.37    Staffing levels would be raised by providing one DCF in charge of
training and four additional instructors at the Forest Ranger level. In
addition, two locally recruited consultants in communication and extension
would be provided for two years to plan and carry out the training in



-48-
forest extension methods (see para 7.06). Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that the two locally recruited teaching consultants would be
appointed not later than June 30, 1983.
Publicity Units
6.38    Two Publicity Units would be established and each attached to an
existing Forestry Circle. Each Division (there are a total of 8 Divi-
sions) would employ a Divisional Publicity Officer (DPO) to coordinate all
activities associated with publicity and dissemination of information in
the Division. Under the project, funds would be provided for staff and
equipment including two Publicity Officers (PO), each in charge of a
Publicity Unit, to support DPOs in their work. Assurances were obtained
at negotiations that the two PO would be appointed not later than December
31, 1983.
Monitoring and Evaluation
6.39    The Project would provide funds to establish a Monitoring and
Evaluation Unit (MEU) headed by a DCF and supported by statistical staff
and field enumerators. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the
Unit would be established not later than December 31, 1982. The unit
would, in the light of experience and data collected, suggest improvements
for project implementation, assess villagers' acceptance of social
forestry activities, determine tree survival rates of the farm forestry
component and carry out a mid-term evaluation of the project. The unit
would produce six monthly progress reports, each June and December in a
format agreed at negotiations and giving details of staff in each field
unit and at headquarters; a summary of activities undertaken during the
preceding six months; and targets achieved and problems encountered during
project implementation. Funds would also be provided for a locally
recruited consultant to advise on the design of survey studis and assist
in setting up systems for project monitoring. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that the DCF in charge of the MEU and the consultant to MEU
would be appointed not later than June 30. 1983.
Wood-Balance Study
6.40    As in JAK, a wood-balance study would be carried out to determine
the consumption and availability of fuelwood and other forest-based
products. The study would be carried out by an appropriate institution
from the State. Cost of the study is estimated to be Rs 1 M (US$
117,000). Details of the proposed study are given in the Project File,
Item 5 and these were agreed upon during negotiations.



-49-
Fellowships
6.41    Local Fellowships.  One local fellowship would be provided for a
DCF to be trained in an appropriate institution in communication and
extension (para 6.37). In addition, four local fellowships would be
provided for teaching staff from Pinjore Forester/Forest Guard school in
forestry extension (para 6.37). Total cost is estimated at Rs 250,000
(US$ 29,411).
6.42    Institutional Fellowships.  Three fellowships would be provided to
the Central Soil Salinity Research Institute to improve research (para
6.13). In addition, two fellowships would be provided to the Haryana
Agricultural University at Hissar in agro-forestry (para 6.30 (h)). Total
cost is estimated to be Rs 137,000 (US$ 16,117).
6.43    External Fellowships.  Fourteen 8-week overseas fellowships would
be provided for senior SFW staff in management and forestry extension.
Total cost is estimated at US$ 200,000.
Consultants
6.44    Ninety-six manmonths of local consultancy time has been provided
for monitoring and evaluation, communication and extension and extension
teaching staff. Total cost is estimated to be Rs 480,000 (US$ 56,470).

VII. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Social Forestry Wing
7.01    Haryana  has established a SFW in its FD.  To handle the increased
administrative responsibility, an Additional Chief Conservator of Forests
has been appointed and is directly responsible to CCF for all social
forestry affairs. To cope with increased planting and maintenance
programs, two social forestry Circles, covering a total of 8 Divisions
would be established. Each Circle would be headed by a Conservator of
Forests. One Circle has already been established and assurances were
obtained at negotiations that the second social forestry Circle would be
established not later than December 31, 1983. Each Division would be
headed by a DC and assisted by an Asst. CF. The 8 Divisions would cover
all the State's 12 districts, i.e., one Division would cover more than one
district depending on the size of the forestry program to be implemented.
Each Division would be staffed by 4 Rangers (each covering about 2094 ha
of forest) and would be assisted by 4 Deputy Rangers who would supervise
all subordinate staff and be technically responsible for establishment
of forest plantations. In addition, 19 Foresters (each covering about 440
ha) would supervise the physical implementation of the plantation program
and each Forester would be assisted by 4-5 Village Forestry Workers (VFW)
(each covering about 90 ha). A determined effort would be made by SFW to
recruit and train women Foresters and VFW.
7.02    The expansion of the State's social forestry program and the
establishment of a Social Forestry Wing would require one new cadre of
field staff to undertake extension activities at the village and farmer
level. VFW would be largely recruited from outside the Forestry Service
and would have completed their secondary school education. In addition,
they would be given 13 weeks of training in forestry and extension methods
which would be supplemented by monthly orientation training given at the
divisional level by the DFO or the ACF. 1/ VFW would encourage village
panchayats and farmers to participate in the social forestry program by
explaining to them the benefits to be derived. In addition, VFW would
supervise planting and forest protection and would be visited by a
Forester at least twice a month to discuss problems arising from project
implemenation. VFW would be based at the village level and would coor-
dinate operations in village woodlot establishment, private forestry and
strip planting. 2/ VFW would explain to farmers the benefits to be
obtained from the social forestry program and keep records of individual
plantings. VFW would visit farmers (individually or in groups) at least
1/ For detailed information on training of VFW, see Item 8 of Project
File.
2/ 744 VFW would be recruited; 1 VFW would cover approximately 7 village
panchayats.



-51-
once a month to discuss problems that may arise. If these cannot be
solved satisfactorily, the problem(s) would be referred to the Forester,
or to the monthly orientation meeting. In addition, they would carry out
simple administrative activities such as monitoring of survival rate of
trees, recording research trials at the village and farmer's level and
provide the linkage between the Forester and the village panchayat and
farmer.
7.03    Each Division would be staffed by a Divisional Publicity Officer
(DPO) who would coordinate all publicity and communication activities in
his area and be directly responsible to PO in his Circle. Research would
be undertaken by the existing research unit at Pinjore and headed by a DCF
(for details on research program see Project File, Item 11). A monitoring
and evaluation unit (para 6.39) would be established and headed by a DCF.
Project Coordination
7.04    Coordination of social forestry activities with programs of other
government agencies at state and district levels would be achieved through
two committees described below:
(a) The State Policy Review Committee would meet as often as
necessary but not less than once a year and would be chaired
by the Minister of Forests. Among its members would be the
Secretary of Forests; Secretary, Department of Animal Hus-
bandry; Secretary, Development; Secretary, Agriculture;
Secretary, Department of Revenue; Secretary, Department of
Finance; Secretary, Department of Education; Chief Engineer,
Public Works Department; Chief Engineer, Irrigation Depart-
ment; Chief Engineer, Public Health Department; Director,
Health Services; Chief Conservator of Forests; General
Manager, Northern Railway; General Manager, Western Railways
and Conservator of Forests.
(b) The District Policy Review Committee would meet at least once
every four months and would be chaired by the Deputy Commis-
sioner of the District. Among its members would be two mem-
bers of the Legislative Assembly; Executive Engineer, Public
Works Department; Executive Engineer, Irrigation Department;
Executive Engineer, Public Health Department; Divisional
Superintendent of Railways in the District; District Education
Officer; Project Director, District Development Agency; Deputy
Director of Agriculture; Deputy Director of Animal Husbandry
and Deputy Conservator of Forests. Assurances were obtained
at negotiations that the State and District Review Committees
would be established not later than December 31, 1982.



-52-
Provision of Training Facilities for Village Forestry Workers
7.05    Village Forestry Workers would be trained at the expanded training
school at Pinjore (para 6.36). Most candidates would be recruited from
outside the forestry service, though some candidates would be recruited
from amongst forest guards. Training in basic concepts of forestry would
be given by FD instructors and training in extension would be given by two
locally recruited consultants (para 6.37). The training of VFW would last
3 months and would be supplemented by one-day monthly orientation training
given at rural training centers (para 7.06). An outline of the training
curriculum is given in the Project File, Item 6.
7.06    Orientation Training would be given to VFW, Deputy Rangers and
Foresters. One-day training sessions held monthly would be given at the
divisional level by the DCF or Asst. CF to approximately 150 field staff
from the division. These sessions would concentrate on practical applica-
tion of knowledge gained, group discussion and problems encountered in
project implementation.   Provision has been made under the project for
the recruitment of a communications and extension consultant to organize
short training courses for DCF and senior SFW staff and to assist DCF to
design extension programs at the divisional level. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that the communication and extension consultant
would be appointed not later than June 30, 1983.

movements internationally and in India.
B. Proposed Financing
8.03    An IDA Credit of US$ 33.0 M, representing 49% of total project
costs net of duties and taxes, is proposed:
Project Financing
(US$ M)
GOJAK/GOI         GOH/GOI           IDA         Total
US$ M             14.1              20.0            33.0         67.1

The credit would be made to GOI on standard terms and would be channelled
to GOJAK and GOH on GOI's terms and arrangements for development assis-
tance to the States. Both GOJAK and GOH have confirmed that the project
has been included in their States' Sixth Plan with sufficient allocation
to cover the cost of the project. Written confirmation of GOJAK and GOH
financial arrangements for the project have been received by the Associa-
tion.                                              4
8.04    In order to ensure an early start of project actions and speedy
and effective implementation thereafter, retroactive financing, not
exceeding US$ 1.0 M would be provided from January 1, 1982 to the date of
credit signing for nursery works and advance work on land preparation and
plantation protection necessary for the 1982 planting season. Retroactive
financing would also cover additional staff who need to be in place by the

re;uired for staff involved in tree planting.
C. Procurement
8.05    Direct plantation works (US$ 31.9 M), including nursery expendi-
cures, planting works, and farm forestry would be scattered over a wide
area and would be carried out over different periods of time. Therefore,
ccntracts following competitive bidding would not be practical. Nursery
works, including the production of seedlings, would be carried out by
force account of the Social Forestry Wings (SFWs) of the two State Forest
Departments. Land preparation, planting and maintenance of village wood-
lots would also be carried out by SFWs with participation from village
panchayats (paras 3.05 and 6.05). 1/ Materials such as cow manure, polpots
and tools would be procured under local competitive bidding (LCB) in
accordance with established local procedures that are satisfactory to IDA.
Contracts for civil works (costing US$ 2.0 M) would be small and widely
dispersed in time and place and, therefore, would not be suitable for
international competitive bidding (ICB) and would be let following LCB,
advertised locally, or by force account and in accordance with established
GO-AK and GOH procedures that are satisfactory to IDA. Design and super-
vision of housing and building construction would be carried out by the
FDs or the Public Works Departments (PWD) of the two States. Vehicles
(US$ 1.0 M) would be purchased over three years and, as adequate main-
tenance and availability of spare parts would be of paramount importance,
this would necessitate purchase of locally made vehicles of types already
used by government departments. Thus, procurement would be by LCB under
existing government procedures which are acceptable to IDA. Imported
augurs, seeds and research equipment would be required in small lots and
would not, therefore, be suitable for procurement under ICB procedures.
These items and other miscellaneous equipment (US$ 0.9 M) would be bulked
whenever possible and procured through LCB except where valued at less
than US$ 20,000 when they would be purchased by prudent shopping through
usual trade channels. The balance of project costs (US$ 31.3 M) would be
staff salaries and related expenditures, training and fellowships (US$
16.3 M) and contingencies (US$ 15.0 M).
1/ Force account procedure would ensure participation by the local
population and provide employment to small farmers and landless farm
laborers living in the project area.

D. Disbursement and Audits
8.06    Disbursements under the credit would be made follows:
(a) civil works; 50%
(b) imported equipment; 100% of foreign expenditure
(c) locally manufactured or locally procured equipment and
vehicles; 50%
(d) direct cost of planting and SFW operating costs; 50%
(e) incremental staff salaries; 43%
(f) local training and research; 70%
(g) consultants services, overseas training and study; 70%
(h) monitoring and evaluation, communication and extension serv-
ices; 60%
8.07    Disbursements for all force account work, salaries, local train-
ing, civil works contracts costing less than Rs 300,000 and other procure-
ment involving expenditures of less than Rs 150,000 for vehicles and
equipment, for which it would not be practical to submit documents, would
be against statements of expenditures certified by the Addl. CCF/CCF of
the two SFWs.  These certificates of expenditure would be audited annually
by the Government auditors and the audit reports would be submitted to IDA
as soon as available.  Supporting documentation for these expenditures
would be retained by the State Governments for inspection in the course of
project review missions.  Separate accounts would be kept of expenditures
made under the project.  In addition, certified copies of project accounts
would be submitted to IDA within nine months of the end of the fiscal year
and such reports would show, inter alia, that the funds withdrawn were
used for the purpose intended, that goods have been received or work
performed, and that payments have been made. All reports would be sub-
mitted by GOJAK and GOH to the Department of Economic Affairs for sub-
sequent transmission to IDA.

IX. PRODUCTION, MARKETING, FINANCIAL RESULTS AND COST RECOVERY
9.01    Yields and Production with the Project.  Main products of project
plantations would be fuelwood, small timber, bamboo, poles, fodder and
fruit. Summaries of projected yields and production are given below and
detailed in Annex 2, Tables 1-2.

Leaf Charcoal (tons)            0.25-1.0      -               4
9.02    Marketing of Produce.  A considerable proportion of project output
would be consumed by the rural population in both States.  Marketable
produce, primarily fuelwood, small timber, bamboo, and poles, would come
from strip plantations, wetlands, and degraded forests. These would be
sold on a stumpage basis through current auction practices or marketed
from sales depots following standard FD procedures. Fuelwood obtained
from wetlands in JAK would be earmarked for the city of Srinagar. In view
of the acute shortage of forest products in both JAK and Haryana, no
marketing difficulties are foreseen for incremental project output. 1/
9.03    Financial Results.  Plantation activities would be carried out
during non-agricultural seasons. Hence, there would be no disruption of
agriculture, and labor shortages would not pose a constraint to the
project. Details of project financial results are given in Annex 3,
Tables 2-14 and Annex 4, Tables 1-5, and are summarized in Annex 3, Table
1.  Financial prices of forestry outputs have been estimated on stumpage
1/  Growing population and increasingly depleted forests have led to a
situation where observed market prices have displayed a long-term real
growth trend of 3% p.a. for timber grade products and 2% p.a. for
fuelwood, poles, and bamboo.

basis. Year-specific prices in constant end FY82 currency have been
employed in the financial analyses to reflect real price increases
projected over the FY82-FY91 period, ranges for which are presented in
Annex 5, Table 1.
9.04    As shown in above referenced tables, project components are
expected to yield favorable net financial results. Projected financial
rates of return (FRR) to investments vary from about 15% (village wood-
lots, Haryana zone B) 1/ to 50% (farm forestry, Jammu), while the FRRs to
principal beneficiary equity lie between 10% (degraded forests, Jammu) to
> 100% (village woodlots and sand dune plantings). For representative
farm holdings in different agro-climatic zones, incremental net farm
family incomes (annualized at 12%) would vary from Rs 45 (Chenab (JAK)) to
Rs 905 (Jammu). 2/ These reflect increases of between 1-13% over without
project net incomes. Variations in incremental farm incomes are caused,
in part, by the relative scope for farm forestry (land availability for
forestry activities and size of holdings). Incremental income also is
affected by the substitutive nature of fuelwood grown with the project for
gathered wood appearing in the without-project scenarios.
9.05    Cost Recovery - Impacts on Government Budgets.  Project cotiponents
would help meet the basic fuelwood and small timber needs principally of
the rural population. Currently, in JAK, these needs are met through
illicit felling and gathering in State forests or through government
programs which use high valued timber for fuelwood and small timber, with
considerable loss to the State exchequer. The project would directly
address both problems by production of fuelwood and small timber in
private, community and State plantings to satisfy needs and thereby
protect valuable forest timber. In Haryana, where State forest lands are
negligible, such potential benefits to the State budget would not apply.
Through its soil conservation effects, the project would also reduce
recurrent State expenses from, inter alia, silt (JAK) and sand (Haryana)
removal from irrigation channels.
9.06    The incremental fiscal impacts of the project on GOJAK and GOH
budgets in real terms are summarized below:
1/ Zone A and Zone B in Haryana have average annual rainfall >600 mm,
and < 600 mm, respectively.
2/ Annex 4, Tables 1-5 provide details of assumptions underlying the with
and without-project farm budget estimates. Rent, as used therein,
represents net incremental benefits after financing adjusted for
compensation to farm family labor and management.

9.07    As shown above, the present values (PVs) of total inflows over
the project life in JAK would considerably exceed project-related outlays
(PVs) principally from the conservation of State forests. In Haryana,
about 31% of costs would be recovered through the project. The widely
different results exemplify well the varying agro-climatic conditions and
relative extent of natural forests. Project cost recovery levels are
considered satisfactory given that the project would provide substantial
employment to the disadvantaged, meet basic needs, and yield substantial
environmental benefits.
9.08    As specified in paras 3.05, 6.05 and 6.11 and summarized in the
above table, the full nominal costs of village woodlots and sand dune
plantings established by SFWs would be recovered from beneficiaries at
first major harvest. Cost of seedlings, however, would not be recovered
from recipients under the project. Several hundred small nurseries would
be established throughout both States. The sale of seedlings would entail
the posting of a forester or a higher ranking FD officer at each nursery
to manage the sale of seedlings. This officer would likely have to be



-60-
armed. Moreover, each nursery would have to be furnished with a safe. In
addition, the sale of seedlings would encourage inequitable distribution
of seedlings since the better-off and influential farmers would monopolize
supplies. Therefore, the additional costs and problems to government
incurred from the sale of seedlings would far exceed the benefits derived.
Under the farm forestry components, free seedlings would represent the
sole project contribution, representing 18-28% of plantation establishment
costs. Farmers would cover the balance of investments chiefly through
provision of family labor for pitting, planting, protection, and main-
tenance.

X. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
Benefits
10.01   The increase in forest produce expected from the project would
benefit chiefly the rural population in both States, and enhanced employ-
ment opportunities, free distribution of seedlings to farmers for private
planting and the right to gather free fodder, fruit, and other minor
produce would particularly favor the rural poor.
10.02   Fuelwood and Other Forest Produce.  Incremental annual production
of fuelwood from all plantings would average about 159,000 tons in JAK,
and 294,000 tons in Haryana. This would be equivalent to the total fuel
needs of about 0.45 M persons in both States.  In addition, annual produc-
tion of small timber and bamboo/poles would average 465,000 mJ and 2.0 M
pieces, respectively.
10.03   Employment.  Over the five-year implementation period, 44,000 ha
in JAK and 67,000 ha in Haryana would be brought under production, through
labor-intensive tree planting. In total, about 29 M mandays of labor
would be generated by the project and this would benefit mainly the land-
less and the disadvantaged sections of the rural population in both
States.
Environmental Impact
10.04   Major environmental benefits from project plantations would be
soil conservation, hill and sand dune stabilization, micro-climatic
improvements, and soil fertility restoration. Most tree species to be
planted are indigenous or naturalized to India. In many cases, up to 50%
of the trees planted would be leguminous. Most of the plantation com-
ponents would contain mixtures of species which are generally more stable
ecologically than monocultures. In farm forests and village plantations,
protection from grazing and trampling, in association with cutting and
harvesting of grasses and fodder, would improve soil and water infiltra-
tion. Strip plantations along roadsides, canalsides, and railways would
assist in controlling erosion and sand depositions.
Economic Benefits and Economic Analysis
10.05   Considering all incremental capital and recurrent costs and
benefits valued in border rupees and constant currency values, the project
is expected to yield an overall economic rate of return (ERR) to invest-
ments, inclusive of physical contingencies, of 27%. The JAK economy would
realize net benefits from project investments of about Rs 942 M (US$ 111
M) in present worth (PW) terms, 1/ and an ERR on project investments of
1/ Discounted at opportunity cost of capital (OCC) of 12%.



-62-
about 34%. The corresponding projected realizations for the Haryana
economy are estimated at Rs 245 M (US$ 29 M) and 19.5%, respectively. The
PWs, ERRs, and switching values (SV) of costs and benefits for the project
in both States as well as their respective planting components, are
presented in Annex 6, Table 1 and Annex 7, Table 1. Each project com-
ponent shows positive contribution to NPW. The economic real flows for
both sub-projects are provided in Annex 8, Tables 1-2 with full reference
to underlying assumptions. The principal assumptions of the economic
analysis are summarized below:
(a) Project Life. Project life in JAK is considered 25 years and
in Haryana, 29 years, based on rotations of the species planted.
(b) Prices. All prices in the economic analyses have been
expressed in constant end FY82 currency units. Year-specific prices were
employed for both inputs and outputs to reflect projected growth in real
prices over the FY82-91 period. Thereafter, prices were assumed to stabi-
lize in real terms. Local costs and domestically-priced benefits were
adjusted to border rupees through application of appropriate conversion
factors, principally a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.80. Annex 5,
Table I presents both the lower and upper bounds of year-specific prices
used.
(c) Forestry Outputs. Except as specified below, all project
forestry products have been valued at domestic market rates. Financial
stumpage prices have been considered to represent economic values when
adjusted to border basis. In Haryana, fuelwood and small timber-grade
prices were employed (see (d) below). In JAK fuelwood and small timber
produced with the project were assumed to substitute for valuable timber
such as pine, fir, and sissoo from State forests otherwise sacrificed for
lower value use. With the project, these species would become available
to the economy as timber and thereby would have considerable additional
value in a market where acute shortage exists and is increasingly
aggravated as natural forests disappear. Financial timber stumpage prices
for these more valuable species have formed the basis for economic valua-
tion of incremental project-generated fuelwood and small timber output in
JAK.
(d) Substitution in Fuel Consumption. Because fuelwood collection
is tedious, it has been assumed that farm-grown fuelwood would first
substitute for gathered fuelwood. In JAK, where holdings are small and
climatic conditions increase demand for fuelwood, project fuelwood was
assumed to replace only wood, leaving dung fuel unaffected with the
project. In Haryana, in constrast, where larger holdings permit more
extensive tree plantings, it has been assumed that 10% of project fuelwood
output would substitute for cow dung cakes and thereby release the wet
manure equivalent for agriculture. The fertilizer nutrient content of



-63-
this manure has been valued at international prices (see Annex 5, Table
1).
(e) Gathering Time Savings. Currently, considerable time is
required by rural families to gather fuel to meet domestic requirements.
This activity, usually demanding the time and effort of women, consumes
a varying amount of time depending on proximity to fuel source and ease
of extraction. At the extreme, rural women are currently estimated to
devote four hours for collection and transport of a 20 kg bundle of fuel-
wood. As forests recede, travel time naturally increases. Labor expended
to collect amounts of fuelwood equivalent to farm forestry, village wood-
lot, and SFW community distributions has been shadow priced at 50% of the
non-peak period agricultural wage to reflect sacrificed productivity
recovered with the project.
(f) Environmental Benefits. With deforestation, erosion increases
at considerable cost to the economy. Among the many adverse impacts of
erosion is siltation of irrigation canals and watercourses. This silt
must be removed by farmers and irrigation departments to keep channels
operational. Siltation also has adverse consequences for fishing and
navigation. Reduced silt removal costs, based on relatively low-cost
mechanical means, have been included as a project benefit at the annual
rate of Rs 13.4 per ha of degraded forest and village woodlot planted in
JAK. This reduced cost is expected to reach Rs 270,000 p.a. by year 8 of
the project (see Annex 8, Table 1). In Haryana, irrigation channels prone
to shifting sand dunes would be protected with strip plantations, yielding
about about Rs 100,000 each year in lower sand removal costs. In Haryana,
each year considerable agricultural land, both irrigated and rainfed, is
lost to production due to advance of sand dunes. With sand dune stabi-
lization works financed under the project, an estimated five percent
advance p.a. would be avoided, thereby protecting net agricultural
production from areas adjacent to plantations (see Annex 8, Table 2).
Such net agricultural production is estimated to increase gradually from
about Rs 6.5 M in 1992 (year 10) to Rs 26.9 M by 2011, the end of the
assumed sub-project life (year 29).
Project Risks
10.06   Sensitivity tests were carried out to assess the impact of varia-
tions in incremental cost and benefit streams on the projects' viability.
SVs for individual and total cost and benefit streams for both
sub-projects as well as their planting components, are provided in Annex
5, Table 1, and Annex 6, Table 1. While an opportunity cost of capital
(OCC) of 12% has been assumed throughout the analysis, SVs were also
calculated at lower and higher discount rates (Annex 7, Table 1). Plots
of PWs for project costs and benefits streams against various discount
rates are presented in Annexes 9-10, Charts 1(a) and 2(a). Loci of all



-64-
possible combinations of SVs for aggregate costs and benefits 1/ for each
sub-project are provided in Annexes 9-10, Charts 1(b) and 2(b).  The SVs
demonstrate that each can bear a relatively large amount of variation in
costs and benefits and still retain economic viability. For example, at
the OCC, total JAK sub-project costs would have to increase by about 735%
or total benefits decrease by about 90% to result in an NPW of zero. In
the case of Haryana, the corresponding cost increase and benefit decrease
are estimated at 130% and 55%, respectively. Since such large cost
increases or benefit decreases, are highly improbable overall project
economic risks are considered low. Risk levels for all individual project
components are likewise in the acceptable range. Reflecting the rela-
tively arid conditions of Haryana Zone B, project components in this area
demonstrate relatively low, but acceptable viability. The considerable
experience that the Haryana FD has in plantation establishment is expected
to ensure expeditious implementation and technical success of Zone B
components.
10.07   To realize project objectives, particularly with regard to com-
munity activities and farm forestry, an interim project evaluation would
be carried out in year 3. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that
GOJAK and GOH would each submit mid-term evaluation reports for IDA review
by March 31, 1985.

XI. RECOMMENDATIONS
11.01   During negotiations, assurances were obtained that:
(a) GOJAK and GOH would each ensure that field staff would live in
the areas assigned for their operations and for this purpose
would provide housing or rent allowance as necessary (paras
3.36 and 6.33);
(b) GOJAK and GOH would keep separate accounts of expenditures
made under the project and they would be audited annually and
the audit reports submitted to IDA as soon as available (para
8.07);
(c) the POs in charge of the Publicity Units would be appointed
not later than December 31, 1983 and the DCFs in charge of the
Monitoring and Evaluation Units would be appointed not later
than December 31, 1982 (paras 3.43 and 3.44; 6.38 and 6.39);
(d) the Monitoring and Evaluation Units would be established and
fully staffed not later than December 31, 1982 (paras 3.44 and
6.39);
(e) the consultants for forestry extension, monitoring and evalua-
tion, and communication and extension would be appointed not
later than June 30, 1983 (paras 3.42, 3.44 and 4.06; 6.37,
6.39 and 7.06);
(f) one new circle for Haryana State would be established by
December 31, 1983 (para 7.01);
(g) the State and District Committees would be established by
December 31, 1982 (paras 4.04 and 7.04);
(h) GOJAK and GOH would each prepare and submit to IDA by March
31, 1985, a mid-term evaluation report on the progress of the
project (para 10.07).
11.02   With the above assurances and conditions, the project would be
suitable for an IDA credit of US$ 33.0 M on standard IDA terms. The
Borrower would be the Government of India.
