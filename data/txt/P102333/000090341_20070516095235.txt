                       zanagement reforms to make intra-province water allocation and
                       'istribution more transparent; (iii) Irrigation service delivery
                       eforms to improve the quality, efficiency and accountability with

                       Jateruse efficiency and on-farm productivity.

                       'here have been good progress and positive outcomes since the
                       lunch o f ISRP inFY05/06. A good start has been in:reducingthe

Risks and Mitigation   When the first development policy loan was approved, a major risk
Strategy:              identified was the history o f uneven high level support to the



                                            1

                     irrigation reform agenda. However, GOPunjab has remained
                     strongly committed to the reform program, which continues to
                     receive strong political support. Water users/farmers also continue
                     to participate in the implementation o f reforms with great
                     enthusiasm and       are witnessing the positive outcomes           o f
                     participatory irrigation management. While there remains an
                     inherent risk that a change in political leadership could affect the
                     current momentum, the reforms have reached the take-off point and
                     there would be pressures to move ahead. Continued Bank support,
                     however, remains critical.

                     Another risk i s that adequate levels o f funding for maintenance and
                     repairs (M&R) may not be sustained. However, the fiscal situation
                     inPunjab has improved and the yardsticks for allocation of M&R
                     budgets have been rationalized. Adequate funding has been
                     allocated for FY06/07.

                     There i s also a risk that staff redundancies resulting from the
                     devolution o f responsibilities to FOs may bring to bear political
                     pressures on the government to slow down the process o f change.
                     IPDis mitigating this riskby adopting a strategy ofnatural attrition
                     o f redundant staff. Furthermore, close monitoring, benchmarking,
                     coupled with a well designed communication strategy i s being used
                     to widely publicize the objectives and the positive outcomes o f the
                     reformprogram.

                     IPD has limited capacity for managing social and environmental
                     risks associated with asset management activities. This risk i s being
                     mitigated by strengthening institutional capacity in these areas
                     through training and capacity buildingand mainstreaming guidelines
                     for addressing social and environmentalrisks inasset management.

                     Finally, there i s a risk that IPD has limited capacity to effectively

                                                LOAN

                                      I.INTRODUCTION

 1.        The proposed US$lOO million Loan would be the second in a programmatic series o f
 three Development Policy Loans o f US$ 100 million each, to support the Government o f
 Punjab's (GOPunjab's) medium term irrigation sector reform program (ISRP), covering FY06-
 08. The first year o f ISRP was supported by the US$ 100 million (equivalent) Punjab Irrigation
 Sector Development Policy Loan approved by the Board on June 1, 2006. This proposed loan
 would support the second year o fthe reformprogram.

 2.        The four inter-related pillars o f the ISRP are: (A) Institutional and policy reforms to
 improve the management and maintenance o f the irrigation system to ensure its long term
physical and financial sustainability; (B) Water resource management reforms to make intra-
province water allocation and distribution more transparent; (C) Reforms to improve the
 quality, efficiency and accountability with which irrigation services are delivered; and (D)
Reformsto improve water use efficiency and on-farm productivity.

 3.       High level of commitment --within the bureaucracy as well as in the political
leadership, and thefarming community-- has been the key factor of success. Punjab i s now
recognized as the leading province in Pahstan in irrigation reforms and other provinces are
 seehng to follow suit. GOPunjab's ownership and support to the ISRP i s evident from: (i)       the
leadership provided by a highlevel inter-departmental reform steering committee reporting to the
Chief Minister; (ii) scaling up o f irrigation management transfers to farmer organizations (FOs)
from one to three new canal command areas, with a system o f monitoring and benchmarhng
performance in place; (iii)  a near doubling o f resources allocated for maintenance and repairs
(M&R) and system rehabilitation, and operationalization o f a system o f performance audits;
(iv) major achievements inmahng water entitlements more transparent, with a robust Irrigation
Management Information System in place; and (v) launching o f a major reform and investment
program (US$900 million) complementary to the ISRP, with the assistance of ADB.

4.        Participation of stakeholders has been a central element of the ISM. An extensive
consultation process was undertaken during the design o f the ISRP. Continuing dialogue with
water users/farmers, during the process o f social mobilization for establishing FOs and capacity
buildingactivities, is an integralpart o fthe reformprocess.

5.         The program being supported under the proposed second loan seeks to move
forward the ISRP agenda under each reform pillar, focusing, inter alia, on (i)     sustainability of
the hydraulic infrastructure by sustaining adequate funding for M&R, reducing costs and further
improving financial accountability; (ii)  expanding the coverage and improving the quality o f the
Irrigation Management Information System (IMIS) to further enhance transparency in the
administration o f water entitlements; (iii)improving service delivery by scaling up irrigation
management transfers, benchmarkmg o f performance,             improving communications with
stakeholders, and mainstreaming environmental and social safeguards in operations and
maintenance activities; and (iv) enhancing productivity through (a) policy reform and incentives
for adopting new technology; (b) improving markets, and (c) restructuring agricultural research.

   TheNational Context-Recent Economic Developments

6.     Since the beginning of the new millennium, Pakistan's economy has staged a
remarkable turnaround, laying the ground for sustained growth and poverty reduction. The
 1990s were a period of slow growth, and progress in reducing poverty and improving social
indicators stagnated. Successive governments initiated reforms, but with only modest results as
reforms faltered midway due to rising political pressures and constrained external financing.
Beginning in 2000, the Government initiated a more wide-ranging and ambitious reformprogram
that was articulated in the Government's 2003 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, "Accelerating
Growth and Reducing Poverty, The Road Ahead." These reforms, along with debt restructuring,
and increased remittances and concessional aid flows, resulted in a dramatic turnaround o f the
economy. In contrast to several previous IMF programs, both the 2000 Stand-by Arrangement
(SBA) and the 2001 three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) were successfully completed. Recent years have witnessed considerable improvement in
the performance o f the industrial and services sector, leading to a significant acceleration in
economic growth, to 7.5 percent in 2003!04 and 8.6 percent in 2004105. In2005!06, Palstan's
economy withstood serious adverse shocks emanating from its worst ever earthquake, a sharp
increase in oil prices, and less favorable weather conditions, and registered continued strong
growth o f 6.6 percent.'

7.           The acceleration in economic growth since 2001102 has led to higher household
incomes and lower poverty. In2005106, the per capita income increasedto $847, up from $742 a
year earlier (an increase of 14 percent in nominal dollars). More importantly however, all
segments of the population, in both urban and rural areas, have gained from income growth.
Poverty declined significantly, and Palustan's social indicators have started to show some
improvements.*



 According to the CPI-based price index overall poverty declined from 34 4% to 23.9%. Inurbanareas, poverty
declined from 22.7% to 14 9% and inrural areas, from 39 3% to 28.1%. According to survey-based prices, overall
poverty declined from 33 3% to 28.3%. Inurbanareas, poverty declined from 22 0% to 18.4%, and in rural areas, from
37 9% to 32.9% The CPIbased price index suffers from beingcollected only in urban areas, thereby leaving out rural
areas where poverty i s the greatest The survey based price data suffers from being very limited, collecting only food
and transport prices, which may be unrepresentative ofthe items on which rural households actually expend

4.2 percent of GDP in 2005/06.3 Net o f earth-quake effect the fiscal deficit was 3.3% o f GDP,
implyingthat a significantpart of earthquake impact was absorbed withinthe budget (See Figure
1). Rapid economic growth, availability of grants and concessional finance, debt cancellation and
fiscal consolidation has enabled Palustan to reduce its debt burden sharply. The government
policy o f usingprivatization proceeds towards retirement o f debt also contributed to lessening o f
debt burden. Total government debt fell from about 80 percent o f GDP in 2001/02 to 56 percent
in 2005/06. Moreover, despite the rapid fiscal adjustment, social and poverty-related
expenditures continued to increase sharply and over a four year period (200 1/02-2005/06) were
raised by 1.8 percentage points o f GDP or by over 12 percent p.a. in real per capita terms,
although they remain low in comparison with other countries at similar levels o f per capita
income. The Government promulgatedthe Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act inJune
2005, under which it has committed itself to specific targets of fiscal adjustment and debt
reduction.

9.         Rapid economic growth and an expansionary monetary policy contributed to strong
aggregate demand. This caused an upsurge in inflation, which increased to 9.3% in 2004/05.
However, the inflation rate dropped to 7.9% in 2005/06 as authorities took measures to tighten
money supply. Despite continued healthy growth in exports during the past two years, the
external situation deteriorated, as imports growth exceeded exports by a considerable margin. As
the trade gap widened, the current account has gone fiom a surplus to a deficit, which in2005/06
i s estimated to have reached 4.2 percent o f GDP, despite sizeable increases in workers'
remittances. Worsening current account balance was financed mainly through non-debt inflows
as continued strong foreign investors' interest ledto a substantial increase inFDI.

Macroeconoinic Outlook and Debt Sustainability
10.        Prospects for continued rapid growth are good, provided that political and
macroeconomic stability are maintained. The government i s aiming to increase growth to 7-8


  In2005106,the earthquake-related expenditure amounted to 0.9% ofGDP.



                                                       6

percent over the long run.For this, it plans to continue to implement refoms to reduce the cost o f
doing business in Palustan, attract investment through the privatization program, and reduce
infrastructure and human development shortfalls. The SBP and the Government have expressed
their commitment to control inflationary pressures and the growing external imbalances, and are
expected to take actions to counter them.

11.         Since early 2005, there has been a gradual tightening o f the money supply. Interest
rates have increa~ed;~reserve and liquidity requirements ratios have been raised (by more than 2
percentage points inthe current fiscal year); and the discount rate has been increased (by 50 basis
points to 9.5. These, coupled with relative stabilization o f oil prices inthe international markets
and crossing the hump o f some lumpy imports, led to a marked slow down in imports duringthe
first 7 months o f 2006/07.' The import growth is projected at 11% for 2006/07. This, however,
did not result in any significant improvement in current account balance as exports too
decelerated. The Pakrstani rupee has appreciated by around 12 percent inreal terms over the past
18 months, which aidedthe strong growth inimports, and may have dampened growthinexports.
Nonetheless, the sudden and sharp deceleration in exports from the beginning o f this fiscal year
may inpart be due to structural factors that have eroded international competitiveness. Owing to
higher non-debt inflows, the foreign exchange reserves increased, albeit only marginally. On the
basis o f these developments, it i s projected that while the current account deficit will remain high
during the next three years, increased capital flows will cause a gradual build-up o f foreign
exchange reserves, which are projected at 3.6 months o f imports in 2006/07 and rising to 3.8
months for the next three years.

12.        Tighter monetary policy also led to some easing of inflationary pressures. Consumer
price inflation declined somewhat from a peak of 11.5 percent inApril 2005 to 9 percent inJuly
2005 and 8.1% in January 2007. On the basis o f a sharp deceleration in monthly inflation in
January, end-year inflation i s projectedto decline to 7.5%.

13.        Tax revenue collection during the first half o f 2006/07 was 27% higher than the
corresponding period in the previous year, in spite o f the sharp deceleration in import-related
taxes. Direct taxes were higher by 66%, reflecting the increased profitability of the corporate
sector, in particular banking, energy and telecommunications, as well as better tax compliance
due to the tax administration reforms within the Central Board o f Revenues (CBR). The fiscal
deficit is, therefore, projected to decline gradually from 4.2% o f GDP in 2005/06 to 3.5% by
2009/10. These relatively low levels o f fiscal deficit will contribute to further improvements in
Palustan debt indicators. Debt sustainability analysis has been carried out by the IMF and by the
World Bank, and indicates that the government's debt reduction path (which is prescribedin the
Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Law) i s consistent with a sustainable debt outlook. As
discussed inparagraph 6, following the conclusion o f the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) in 2004, Palustan is now on a standard Article IV surveillance schedule. IMF post-
program Monitoring was deemed unnecessary by the IMF's Board. An IMF Article IV
Consultation mission took place in August 2006, and a Staff Report was discussed by the IMF
Boardinearly November 2006.

14.        Provincial Context - Issues in provincial finances and recent developments: For
over a decade, Punjab's public finance had been quite prudently managed. The government's



     Treasury Billrates increased from 1.7% in 2003104 to over 8% in the current year.
     The growth inimports decelerated from 31% in 2005/06 to 12%during the first seven months of 2006/07.

fiscal strategy6 has been effective in creating a significant fiscal space inthe provincial budget to
sustain the wide ranging reforms that the provincial government has initiated. These reforms,
which aim at improving the management o f and financing for various high-priority public
services such as education, irrigation and health, have led to a significant increase inprovincial
expenditure. Furthermore, in an effort to increase the pace o f economic development in the
province, the provincial government has substantially enhanced its development outlays. As a
result, provincial fiscal deficit has increased. However, the fiscal deficit is still relatively small
(below 1% o f provincial GDP -- see Table 2) to be considered a threat to the fiscal and financial
stability o f the province, or to sustainability o f key reform initiatives undertaken by the
government. In addition provincial debt i s less than 6% o f provincial GDP and i s expected to
decline steadily infuture.

15.          The provincial revenue has continued to grow at a healthy rate o f about 15% p.a. over
the last five years (2000/01         -2005/06) as both the own-source revenue and federal transfers


      For last four years, the governmenthasbeenpursuingastrategy of creatingadditionalfiscal space through:
      (i)increasedrevenuemobilization;(ii)reducinglow-priorityexpenditures(e.g.subsidies);(iii)reducingdebt
      servicingby swappingexpensivedebt with concessionalloans; and(iv) reducing(inmedium-term)the

      and G.P. Funds.


                                                       8

continue to show robust increases. Moreover, despite the repeated increase in salary o f
government employees during the last 5 years, the recurrent expenditure of the province has
grown at an annual rate o f only 10%. This is mainly on account o f fiscal reforms undertaken by
the government, as expenditure on untargeted provincial subsidies declined at a rate o f 28% p.a.
and the provincial strategy o f swapping more expensive federal government debt with less
expensive foreign debt has been instrumental in reducing the interest payments o f the
government by 6% p.a.7

16.        The increase in fiscal deficit i s therefore solely on account to the sharp escalation in
development spending, which have increased at a rapid rate of 31% p.a. during the last 5 years.
This i s partly due to conscious efforts on the part o f the provincial government to utilize the
additional fiscal space to catch-up with the large human and infrastructure development needs o f
the province, which have accumulated during the last decade due to expenditure compression
caused by the adverse fiscal situation. However, a part o f this increase, especially in 2006107
budget, was caused by the province's inability to implement its debt reduction strategy as was
envisaged earlier. This was mainly due to delays inadjustments made inthe federal accounts for
these early repayments,* leading to some reduction in the benefits o f provincial debt reduction
policy.   The provincial government, therefore, opted for the next best use o f these fiscal
resources, i.e. to recapitalize the pension fund and to use them for social and infrastructural
development o f the province. Inclusion o f Special Infrastructure Program (SIP) into the
provincial development budget i s another factor behind this sharp increase in development
program.

17.        The SIP, comprising three large road sector projects,' explains almost one-half (Rs 23
billion) of the increase in 2006/06 provincial development program. Furthermore, the provincial
Medium-Term Development Framework (MTDF)" shows large allocations for these projects in
2007108 and 2008/09. This implies that the rapid increase indevelopment budget may continue
in2007108,butthis growth will drop sharply in2008/09.

18.        Nonetheless, the government remains fully aware that these projects are too costly to
be fully financed through provincial budget. It therefore worlung on strategy to implement these
projects on public-private partnership (i.e. BOOT) basis, where basic physical infrastructure
would be financed through the provincial budget, while the operational investment will be made
byprivate sector operators. This will reduce the budgetary impact o fthese projectsto about one-
half. Moreover, the authorities have indicated that if the fiscal deficit continues to increase, the
provincial government is prepared to take necessary additional steps to ensure fiscal stability. In
this regard, it is prepared to re-prioritize its expenditure and curtail the low-priority spending
while malung adequate allocations for social sectors and other high-priority expenditure. In
addition, as a contingency plan to reinforce fiscal discipline, the provincial government has
already obtained approval from the Chief Minister to cap the development budget at the 2006/07
level innominal terms (i.e. Rs 100 billion) for the next three years.


7       Underthc provincialfiscal reformprogram, the untargeted food (wheat) subsidy isbeingphasedout, whereas
        under its debt management strategy, the province pre-maturely retired Rs 12 billion of expensive federal
        loans from the proceeds o f concessional financial assistance it received from Asian Development Bank
        (PFNP) and the World Bank's first education credit (PESAC)
8       The issue related to adjustment of early repayments has recently been resolved.
9       These include Lahore Ring Road (with an estimated cost o f Rs 18 billion), Lahore-Sialkot Motonvay (Rs 13
        billion) and Lahore Mass Transit System (Rs 168 billion)
10      As the provincial MTBF was put on hold (see below), the provincial government decided to prepare a MTDF
        Instead, which gives three-year sectoral projections for development expenditures only

19.       Budgetary reforms: On structural reforms, the preparationo fprovincial MediumTerm
Budget Framework (MTBF) suffered a temporary setback, as the federal government insisted
that all provincial efforts for medium-term budgeting should follow the federal government
methodology o f a phased (department-wise) preparation o f MTBF through detailed costing o f
departmental activities. However, now that the federal government itself has changed its
methodology," adopted a new model, the provincial government has restarted the process o f
preparing 2006/07-2008/09 MTBF. Inthis regard, the finance department has already prepared
three-year projections for provincial fiscal resources and broad sectoral ceilings for
departmental/sectoral expenditures.           These ceilings will now be discussed with the line
departments,I2 before the finalization o f MTBF. The government feels that the provincial MTBF
would be finalized soon.

20.       Significant progress is made on other structural reforms.              The concept and legal
framework for the establishment o f Punjab Pension Fund was recently approved by the
provincial Cabinet and the framework has been forwarded (as a Bill) to the Provincial Assembly
for discussion and enactment.          The professionally managed Punjab Pension Fund would be
established after approval o f its Act by the Provincial Assembly. The government has already
placed Rs 2 billion into the Pension Fundwhile another Rs 10 billion have been earmarked for
the Fund in the 2006107 budget, which will be deposited into the Fund after its formal
establishment.

21.       Irrigation sector budget: The 2006107 provincial budget shows a significant increase
in allocation for irrigation sector.            Compared with the (revised estimates of) 2005/06
expenditures, the recurrent budget for the sector has been increased by 13.5%. While the 11%
increase in the establishment cost i s budgeted mainly to cater for the salary increase announced
by the federal government, the maintenance and repairs (M&R)budget shows a healthy increase
o f 19%. This increase i s even more pronounced (54%) when compared with the 2005/06 budget,
as additional funds were allocated for these expenditures during 2005/06, as M&R budgets
estimates were rationalized on the basis of market rates instead o f CSR (see Table 3).

22.       On the development side, the increase inirrigation sector allocation is more than 21%,
with allocation for flood-related civil works, buildingsand for donor-assisted projects increasing
by 62%, 196%, 45%, respectively (see Table 4). The provincial Medium-Term Development
Framework (MTDF) shows a sharp increase in development allocation for the irrigation sector,
withbulk o fthis increase financed through donor funds.




11      The newMTBF methodologyi s more in line with the methodologywhich the Punjabgovernmenthas been
        pursuingfor the last 3 years
12      For this purpose, the FinanceDepartmentwill arrange aworkshopinnext few weeks, so as to discussthe
        sectoral expenditureceilingsjointly with all departments.

23.        Provincial debt and its sustainability: Rapid increase in provincial development
expenditure has led to a sharp increase inprovince's borrowing from the donor community. This
created some concerns about the province's debt situation and sustainability o f provincial
finances. However, a careful look at the provincial debt indicates that these fears are largely
unfounded. Not only that the provincial debt has remained in the acceptable range both as
percent o f PGDP and provincial revenue, the debt situation has improved significantly duringthe
last five years and i s expected to improve further in future, despite the continued highreliance o f
the province on external loans (see Table 4). While the constitutional constraints on provincial
borrowing could be attributed with the soundness o f provincial debt situation, the improvement
inthe provincial debt situationis solely due to a sound debt policy adopted bythe province over
the last five years. Swapping more expensive federal government debt with the less expensive
foreign debt has not only improved the provincial fiscal space but has also led to a marked
improvement in the NPV o f provincial debt. While the stock o f provincial debt has increased
from Rs 161 billion in 2001/01 to Rs 231 billion in 2005/06, as a percent o f PGDP, it has
declined from 7.7% to 5.9%. The improvement in NPV o f provincial debt i s even more
pronounced, which has fallen by more than half during this period (from 4.8% o f PGDP in
2000/01 to 1.9% in2005106).

24.        On the assumptions o f continued good economic performance by the province;
continued availability o f U S $ 300-600 million o f additional foreign loans per annum. (albeit not
on as concessional terms as in the past); and normal amortization o f existing debt, the debt
situation o f the province i s projected to improve sharply infuture, as the provincial debt (and its
NPV) are expected to continue to decline as a percent o f PGDP and the provincial revenue. The
provincial debt service liability will therefore decline sharply leading to a rapid improvement in
provincial fiscal space thereby ensuring the sustainability of provincial reform initiatives,
including those inthe irrigation sector.

25.        Insummary, while theprovincialfiscal deficit hasincreased, thefiscalposition of the
province has remained sound as the fiscal deficit still constitutes a relative small portion o f
provincial GDP. Inaddition, the provincial debt position has continued to improve and is like to
improve further in future. The provincial finance authorities remain confident and adamant to
maintain the provincial fiscal stability, without compromising the sustainability o f its key reform
initiatives. While the growth in development budget will slow down from 2008/09 (or even
earlier), growth in recurrent expenditure will accelerate as financing o f government's sectoral
reforms moves from the development to recurrent budget. Nonetheless, the amendment made in
the NFC Award will provide the Punjab government with sizeable increase in federal revenue
transfers, while interest payments and other low-priority expenditure will continue their
downward trend in future. This will enable the provincial government to fully finance its reform
activities while maintaining fiscal stability.

                              111.      THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM


    FederalProgram

26.         The federal government has taken several important actions during the last two years
to address water sector challenge^'^ that fall within the federal domain, including support to the
provinces for water conservation; planning and developing additional water storage capacity;
determination o f environmental flow requirements o f the Indus delta; and establishing capacity in
the Ministry o f Water and Power to steer water sector reform and buildinstitutional capacity for
fundamental sector needs, including, among others, proposals for the creation o f an independent
Dam Safety Organization and strengthening o f the Indus River System Authority (IRSA), which
i s responsible for the administration o f the Inter-Provincial Water Apportionment Accord o f
1991.

     Punjab's Program

27.         Punjab's Irrigation Sector Reform Program (ISRP).                            Imgation is one o f the
building blocks of the Punjab Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (P-PRSP) currently being
revised. The existing P-PRSP emphasizes improving governance by enhancing the
accountability o f state institutions; improvement in social service delivery systems;
accelerating growth and generating employment through enhanced focus on productive
sectors; and enhancing the effectiveness o f public expenditures through budgetary and
institutional reforms. When the ISRP14 was designed and launched, Punjab faced several
challenges in the water sector. These challenges and the ISRP strategy for addressing them are
summarized below".

Long termphysical andfinancial sustainability of Punjab's irrigation systeni

28.         The Challenge: Inthe past Punjab investedmassivelyinwater infrastructurebutmuch
o f it got into a state o f disrepair because of the past policy of build-izeglect-rebuild.This was true
even for some o f the major barrages, where failure would be catastrophic. There was no modem
asset management plan nor an effective financing plan that would permit to answer the three
basic questions o f how much money i s needed, who should pay, and how should it be used.
Most o f the IPDbudget was for staff salaries, leaving maintenance and repair chronically under-
funded. The quality o f irrigation services was poor providing little incentive for farmers to pay
abiana (water charges). Consequently, cost recovery was low which fed into a vicious circle.
Moreover, management of a number o f assets (e.g. tube wells, machinery workshops), which
were an unnecessary burden on the budget, could be progressively divested to the private sector.

29.         The ISRP Strategy. Duringthe preparation o f the ISRP the Government recognized
the need for a change in the incentive structure. Given the large back-log of accumulated
deferred maintenance (PKR 120 billion), the ISRP envisages a multi-pronged strategy involving
both short and medium terms measures for: improving asset management and progressively

reducing the accumulated deferred maintenance; reducing operating and administrative costs;
rationalizing and improving recovery o f abiana through user participation in assessment and
collection; implementing a more transparent policy for sharing cost o f M&R (budgetary
allocations and user charges); and developing institutional capacity for efficient M&R with due
regardto social and environmental aspects.

Transparency of intra-province water allocations and distribution

30.       The Challenge: Poor governance and low trust amongst water users were identified as
the key factors underlying the poor performance o f the irrigation system and l o w productivity.
Lack o f reliable information on entitlements, water availability inthe system, and the volumes o f
water actually supplied, resulted in uncertainty for farmers, and promoted discretionary decision
malung, poor accountability, and rent seelung behaviors, amongst the operators16. Inequitable
water distribution (as well as water theft) was common all the way fi-om the barrages to the
watercourses. The worst affected were the poorest farmers who were typically at the tail-end o f
the distribution system.

31.       The ISRP Strategy. The ISRP emphasizes the nexus of surjiace water entitlements,
measurements and transparency and ultimately extending this to groundwater as well.                                  These
reforms seek to enhance farmer confidence, reduce uncertainty o f water deliveries and help
increase productivity.           In the long run, the opportunity cost o f water would become more
transparent and provide incentives for allocation o f water towards uses of higher returns, through
a market mechanism. Effective administrationo f a well-established system o f water entitlements
would also help address the anarchic development o f groundwater use, among others by making
surface water distribution more reliable and predictable. It would also make water management
at the FO level more effective and equitable by allowing more flexibility in adapting to scarcity
and reducing internal conflicts.

Improving Irrigation Service Delivery

32.          The Challenge. hgation institutions in Palustan have not made the transition from
the era o f development and construction to the era where management o f resources and services
i s the primary challenge". h g a t i o n service delivery was the monopoly o f the IPD and was
characterized by: unreliable and inequitable water deliveries"; rent seekmg behaviors; absence
o f user participation in operation, maintenance and management; lack o f an effective
communication strategy; and low recovery o f operation and maintenance costs. L o w O&M cost
recovery in part reflected the poor services received in exchange from the IPD, and in part, the
lack o f involvement o f the farmers in the management o f water distribution and operation and
maintenance. There was no relationship between better recovery (by the Revenue Department)
and better quality services (by IPD). As a consequence, accountability o f the IPD was mostly

l6   Conceptually, the simplest task for water managers i s to move water ina predictable, timely manner to those who
     need it andhave a right to it. While Punjab has among the best water engineers inthe world, in the past, this task
     was done less inthe light o f day and more behind anopaque curtain. This resulted ininequitable distribution o f
     water, poor technica1 performance and a pervasive environment o fmistrust and conflict, from the provincial level
     to the watercourse.
l7   Helping start the transition to a modem service delivery architecture was a major objective o f the National
     Drainage Program. While achievements under the NDP were modest, many lessons were learned (focusing on a
     few key objectives, and encouraging experimentation with different forms o f institutional reform), and the
'*   centrality o f the objectives o f the NDP remain valid.
     Fanners inthe tail reaches o f the canals invariably do not get their share o fwater due to the poor state of the
     canals, water theft by farmers inupper reaches, and rent seeking by operators.

upwards rather than downwards towards the final client-the                   irrigators. Also, the "monopoly" o f
the IPD on service delivery had not been conducive to the intervention o f new actors and
partners.

33.       The ISRP Strategy. Malung the service delivery system more efficient required
decentralization o f responsibilities to FOs as well as contractual arrangements for delivery o f
bulk water supplies, whereby rights and responsibilities were clarified and accountability
mechanisms improved, and an effective strategy to communicate with stakeholders both within
and outside the IPD.Participatory Irrigation Management has proven all over the world to hold
the promise o f more effective management o f distributary systems by the farmers themselves, if
coupled with the transfer o f financial authority over a share o f the water charges. Transfer o f
irrigation schemes to FOs needs to be accompanied by adequate capacity buildingprograms as
well as rehabilitation or an enhanced M&R program for the existing infrastructure. The good
results achieved in the LCC East canal system (where this transition has already taken place)
need to be gradually extended to the remaining canal commands, while focusing on building
capacity o f FOs and maintaining an effective change management strategy for IPD.

Improving water use efficiency andproductivity

34.       The Challenge: Irrigation and agriculture have remained relatively disconnected
because o f the supply-driven nature o f the irrigation system. Consequently, agriculture
productivity has remained low despite the large investment in water infrastructure. While
improving agnculture productivity will remain a long-term objective, with many elements to it,
the irrigation sector ought to become more responsive to the need o f agriculture production,
especially to the need for diversification and value addition. For this to happen, more attention
needs to be give to demand side actions that will greatly exercise a strong influence over farm
incomes throughprices and fiscal policy.

35.       The ISRP Strategy. Increases in agnculture productivity need to come both from
supply and demand driven measures where more efficient water distribution needs to be
accompanied by more output (crops, jobs and income) per drop o f water used19. Actions have to
taken on several policy fronts, including: (i)incentives for adoption o f water conserving
technologies and for moving away from crops and practices that waste water; (ii)                       improving the
agriculture markets and incentives structure; and (iii)restructuring the agricultural research
system to help generate appropriate technology and improved agronomic practices.

Key Achievements under the ISRP

36.       The achievements made duringthe second year o f the ISRP are summarized belodo:

A. Pillar I:Reforms to improve the management and maintenance of the irrigation system to
ensure its long termphysical andfinancial sustainability

37.        Duringthefirst year of theISRP, progress was made inseveral key areas, including (i)
preparation o f a complete inventory of IPD assets and assessment o f the deferred maintenance


19      To improve efficiency ofwater use, Punjab also needs to gradually adopt a system ofwater deliveries and
        water charges on volumetric basis.
20      Considering that the proposed operation is part o f a three-year program, a summary of the achievements
        made inthe first year o f the program is also presented for the sake of clarity and continuity.

and the rehabilitation needs; (ii)rationalization of yardsticks for estimating budget
requirements for routine and preventive maintenance (the yardsticks are now based on market
prices rather than CSR, as was the case earlier); (iii)               a two fold increase in the M&R budget
during FY06 as compared to FY05; (iv) formulation o f a M&R cost sharing policy that makes
the requirements for public sector financing and users' contribution for various tiers o f the
system explicit (based on the identification o f public and private goods); (v) establishment o f a
system for M&R performance evaluation; and (vi) implementation o f various measures for
ensuring greater transparency in procurement and enhanced financial accountability o f IPD
executives.

38.          During the second year of the ISRP, the IPD has moved ahead with the following
reforms actions: (i)     A 10year Asset Management Plan that sets priorities for mediudlong term
rehabilitation and maintenance o f the existing infrastructure and incorporates social and
environmental guidelines, has been prepared; (ii)                M&Ryardsticks have been revised to reflect
FY07marketprices2', andthe FY07M&Rbudget has been allocated accordingly; (iii)                                divesture
of public sector owned tube wells has been started (50% o f remaining FGW and over 50% o f
SGW tube wells) have been notified for "transition"22; (iv) a performance evaluation system
for M&R has been operationalized, and a Procurement Unit has been established in IPD as part
o f a Project Monitoring Unit that would oversee implementation o f new major projects; (v)
backlog of advance audit observations has been reduced by 20.7% exceeding the target o f
20% reduction inFY07; and (vi) abiana collectionperformance has improved.

B. Pillar 11: Water ResourceManagement Reforms to emphasizethe nexus of entitlements,
measurements and transparency and build on Punjab 's existingplatform of water
entitlements23

39.          During thefirst year of the ISRP, progress was made in several key areas, including:
(i) IrrigationManagementI?formationSystem(IMIS),thatallowsmonitoringofauthorized
   an
and actual water diversions in various parts o f the system, was established; (ii)                     IPD undertook
repairs (and installation o f new water metering gauges), in the L C C East canal system, and
started posting on the PD website information on water entitlements and actual volumes o f
water diverted in all the 24 main canals o f Punjab; (iii)             staff was recruited and trained for gauge
reading and data transmittal & capture in the I M I S system; (iv) a website oversight committee
comprising o f FOs' representatives, IPD officials, and other stakeholders was established to
ensure that information on the website i s responsive to the users' needs, accessible, user friendly,
clear, accurate and timely; and (x) water users now have access to a toll-free telephone number to
report any deviations between entitlements and actual diversions, and to register complaints.

40.          Duringthe secondyear of the ISRP, the following actions have been taken to deepen
and broaden the reform under this pillar: (i)              water accounts (allocations and deliveries, balance


     The yardsticks are being further revised to reflect Irrigation Zone-specific M&R funding requirements.
22  "Transition" includes: handover o f tube wells to farmer groups for operation as such; or replacement by smaller
     capacity farmer owned tube wells with capital cost subsidized by government; or permanent closure, ifnot needed
    by farmers for irrigationor drainage purposes.
23  Pakistan has a long- and well-established tradition o f water entitlements. The 1991Inter-provincial Water Accord
     establishes clear entitlements for each province. Implicit inthe Water Accord, too, is a set o f water entitlements at
    the canal command level. There are also well-established rules for further distributing water to the distributary
     and outlet levels. Below the outlets, the warubandi is a proxy (appropriate in its era) to a water right, in which a
    farmer has a right to time, a surrogate for water. However, the administration o f intra-province water entitlements
    needs to be made more transparent and implemented ina participatorymanner.


                                                             18

shares, etc.) for all main canals continue to be posted on IPD website; (ii) accounts for       water
distributary canals in L C C East canal system have also posted on the IPD website;
(iii)warabandi (water entitlements at the farm level are being published by W J A s on their
respective notice boards; and (iv) a draft o f a holistic groundwater management strategy
covering all sub-sectors (agriculture, urban and rural drinlungwater, industry, environment) has
been prepared.

C. Pillar 111: Irrigation Service Delivery Reforms to improve the quality, efficiency and
accountability with which irrigation services are delivered

41.         Duringthefirst year of the ISRP, progress was made in several key areas, including:
(i) processofdecentralization anddevolution ofirrigationmanagement responsibility was
   the
started -- One Area Water Board (AWB) was established in the LCC East Canal System, FOs
were established on all its distributary and IrrigationManagement Transfer Agreements (IMTAs)
were signed with 84 FOs; (ii)           training and capacity building24o f FOs was started; and (iii)
preparations for monitoring and benchmarking o f FOs were initiated; (iv) water discharge
measurements on main, branch and distributary canals were carried out on daily basis in LCC
East canal system; (v) to enhance trust and confidence measurement of discharges at head o f
distributaries were carried out jointly by IPD and FOs; (vi) a Social and Environmental
Management Unit (SEMU) was established with a mandate to build awareness and capacity for
social and environmental risk management in FOs, AWBs, and IPD; and (vii) a high level
Interdepartmental Steering Committee was established to monitor overall reform progress and
provide guidance.

42.         During the second year of the IS-,                the following key actions have been taken:
(i)notification of two new AWBs covering the LCC (West), and the LBDC main canals;
(ii)establishmentof 95 additional FOsZ5and signing o f IMTAswith them; (iii)                         continuation o f
FO capacity building program; (iv) staffing and capacity building of IPD's Social and
Environmental Unit (SEMU), which has prepared guidelinesfor increasingawarenesswithin
IPD,AWB, and FOs, for assessingand mitigating social and environmentalrisks associated
with asset management activities; (v) preparationo f a communicationstrategyz6and a related
action plan that will help inform and win stakeholders' support for the reform, as well as
improve overall communication within the IPD and with water users, and improve IPD's public
image; (vi) arrangements have been made for internal monitoring, and the services o f an
independent agency have been procured for external monitoring (third party validation);
(vii) rehabilitation of FO managed channels is being carried out under ongoing projects;
(viii)PD is in the process of developing a modernization plan; and (ix) IPD has completed
staffing o fits Reform Unit.




24  Capacity building involves a range o ftechnical, managerial and social aspects, including financial management,
    O&MIM&R planning, water measurement, abiana collection, conflict resolution and consensus building,
    women's role, environment, monitoring, procurement and contract management.
25  This number is expected to exceed 100within FY07.
26  While the communication strategy (covering internal and external communications as well as publicity of ongoing
    reforms and efforts to improve the public image o fthe IPD) was still under preparation, IPD adopted some good
    practices, including consultation with farmers on scheduling of canal closures for annual maintenance as well for
    rehabilitation works.

D.Pillar IV:Reforms to improve water useefficiency and on-farm productivity

43.        While no prior actions were envisaged in the context o f DPL I,GOPunjab made
progress in several key areas during the first year of the ISRF', including: successful
implementation o f water conservation measures, including improvement over 4,000 watercourses
and uptake o f 500 laser land leveling units by farmers and service providers, which were used for
leveling some 19,500 ha o f land. In the command area of improved watercourses and the land
leveled, increases in cropping intensity and crop yields and on-farm jobs were achieved. A
Department of Agricultural Marketing was established to deal with marketing issues; a Punjab
Agricultural Marketing Company was formed for the creation o f market infrastructure for
perishable commodities; market information systems were established at the district level; and
proposals were prepared for amending the Punjab Agricultural Produce Ordinance to support
the role o f private sector, and public-private partnerships, and for restructuring agncultural
research.

44.        Duringthesecondyear of theISRP,water conservation measures were continued on a
larger scale, with the FY07 targets for watercourse improvement were increased from 4,000 to
5,000, and for laser leveling units from 500 to 1,000. Outside the ambit o f the DPL2, the
Department o f Agriculture i s also carrying out various reforms that complement the program
supported by the B a n k (i)   an amendment to the Agncultural Produce Marketing Ordinance o f
1978 i s being processed, which among others will open up entry o f farmers and private sector in
the management o f agriculture market places; help to formulate and implement internal and
export market strategies; rationalize the system o f market fee; and facilitate linkages and
partnerships between farmers and cooperatives, and (ii)          restructuring the agncultural research
sector has been started. The package includes reactivation o f the Punjab Agnculture Research
Board (PARB), and creation o f corporate bodies for dealing with important crops, with the
ability to attract qualified scientists and with adequate administrative and managerial flexibility.

47.         The proposed Second Irrigation Sector DPL i s specifically identified in the 2006-09
CAS, which reflects the lessons learned during the last CAS period, including among others: (i)                 a
programmatic approach provides the flexibility to support reforms while managing risk;
(ii) attentionneedstobegiventocapacitybuilding;and(iii) needtofocusonresults.

48.         CAS ResultsSupported by the ProposedDPL.The proposed Loan would contribute
to the following outcomes, which the Bank expects to influence during the CAS period:
(i)improved management o f irrigation and drainage infrastructure; (ii)                     improved irrigation
service delivery, through participatory irrigation management and efficient cost recovery; and
(iii) transparent and more equitable water allocation and distribution.

49.         The CAS milestones and indicators of progress towards the above outcomes
include: Asset Management Plans prepared with increased funding for M&R; number o f FOs
established and collecting abiana; reduced water losses in on-farm channels (see CAS Results
Framework). These CAS outcomes and indicators are directly supported by the proposed DPL
and are included inProgradPolicy Matrix along withbaselines and targets.

COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMFAND OTHERDONORS

50.      The Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) continue to have significant
interactions on Pakistan's macroeconomic issues. After successful completion of the last
PRGF arrangement, Pakistan authorities have not sought a successor arrangement with IMF.
Pahstan i s now on a yearly Article N Consultations cycle. The Bank continues to work closely
with the IMF on these consultations. The last IMF Article N Consultations mission was
undertaken inAugust 2006, inwhich the World Bank participated as an ob~erver.~'

51.        Besides the Bank, the ADB, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the
Netherlands Government are the main donors inthe water sector inPahstan. The Bank has close
coordination, and full alignment on the sector assistance strategy, with these partners. Duringthe
last ten years, ADB and JBIC have co- or parallel-financed several operations with the Bank;
including the NDP and the Drought Emergency Recovery Program. In 2005, the Netherlands
Government approved a Pahstan- specific free standing trust fund for supporting Bank Group's
advisory services, and technical assistance activities, in the water sector.                   JICA i s currently
parallel-financing an ongoing project for the rehabilitation o f the Taunsa Barrage, and ADB has
recently negotiated a multi tranche financing facility (MFF) for a Punjab Irrigated Agriculture
Improvement Program (PIAIP) with an estimated cost o fUS$900 million over eleven years. This
MFFcomplements the institutional andpolicy reforms supportedbythe proposed Bank Loan and
would support rehabilitation and improved management o f major hydraulic infrastructure (e.g.
several barrages and main canals). The ISRP will also benefit from the reforms supported by
ADB under the PunjabResource Management Program.

RELATIONSHIPTO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

52.           Ongoing Bank support to Pakistan in the water sector includes: (i)                         support for
institutional reforms and on-farm productivity through On-Farm Water Management Projects-
one each in NWFP and Sindh, which seek to improve water management and irrigation service
delivery through increased farmer participation; (ii)             support for rehabilitation and modernization
o f vital irrigation infrastructure to safeguard their integnty and reduce risks of failure (Taunsa
Barrage Emergency Rehabilitation and Modernization Project in Punjab); and (iii)                       provision o f
just in time, technical assistance and analytical and advisory assistance (AAA) to Government,
on strategc and policy issues, through trust funds and other sources o f funding. Experience
under the Taunsa Barrage Project has highlighted the need for a major enhancement in IPD's
capacity to identify, and deal with, social and environmental issues, including resettlement,
communication and consultation with farmers, and identification o f mitigation measures in an
effective and timely manner.

53.           Future Program: The Bank's Country Water Resources Assistance Strategy
(CWRAS) for Palustan provided the underpinning o f the water sector elements o f the CAS. The
CAS includes support for a combination of institutional reforms and investments in the sector
including: (i)    major investments in rehabilitation o f critical assets (including barrages and main
canals), and preparation o f Asset Management Plans, which will set priorities for rehabilitation
and maintenance, make explicit the requirements for public and user financing, and develop
institutional arrangements for M&R o f infrastructure; (ii)development of capacity at the
provincial and federal levels for improving water resource management; (iii)                   reforms to improve
the quality, efficiency, and accountability with which irrigation services are delivered; and
(iv)investments in on-farm services.                The Bank will continue to implement the CWRAS,
supporting an agenda o f policy and institutional reform and capacity building as well as
investments, including rehabilitation o f existing critical assets.                   We would also prepare a
framework for supporting new storage and hydropower within the context o f future management
and development o f the Indus river basin, articulated in the concept paper for the Irzdus21
initiative3'. Finally, given the major scientific, policy and implementation challenges ahead, the
Bank, with support from the Government o f the Netherlands, will provide analytical and
technical support to the federal and provincial governments. Bank support will be provided
through development policy lending as well as specific investment lending to finance
infrastructure and institutional reforms, including the up-coming Water Sector Improvement
Project in Sindh and a small scale irrigationproject inBalochistan.

LESSONSLEARNED

55.        The Bank has played a central role in the development of Pakistan's Indus Basin
Imgation System, the largest integrated irrigation network in the world. The Bank's partnership
with Palustan inthe water sector dates back to 1952 when the first loan was approved for a water
project inthe then East Pahstan. Inthe 1950s, the Bank's good offices were instrumental inthe
successful negotiations o f the Indus Waters Treaty (1960) between Pakistan and India, which
settled the division o f the waters o f Indus Basin between the two countries, following Partition in
1947. After the signing o f the Indus Waters Treaty, the Bank helped to mobilize funds and
administered the Indus Basin Development Fund during 1960-1967, which financed the physical
works to implement the Treaty provisions, also known as the Indus Basin Development Project
(IBDP). Subsequently, from 1968 onwards, the Bank administered the Tarbela Development
Fund (TDF), which was extended to the post-Tarbela construction period, during which
extensive remedial works were implemented, after the first impounding o f the Tarbela reservoir.
Thereafter, the Bank played a catalytic role inperiodic major reviews o f the irrigation and power
strategy, and funded parts o f the resulting investment programs. Recently, the Bank also played
its role under the Treaty inthe context o f the "difference" that arose regarding the Baglihar dam.

56.        Inaddition to financing specific investments, the Bank also supported Economic and
Sector Work and provided analytical and advisory assistance (AAA) that culminated in several
major sector reports, including: Water and Power Resources o f West Pahstan: A Study in Sector
Planning: (popularly h o w as the Lieftinck Report 1967); Revised Action Program for h g a t e d
Agriculture (1979); the Water Sector Investment Planning Study (1991); Pahstan -- Imgation
and Drainage: Issues and Options (1994); and Accelerated Development o f Water Resources and
Imgated Agriculture, prepared as part o f the Public Expenditure Review, carried out in 2003. In
addition, several sector policy and planning studies, including a draft National Water Policy, and
a framework for a Drainage Master Plan for the country were prepared through the technical
assistance components o f Bank-assisted projects as well as various Trust Funds managed by the
Bank, including the Bank-Netherlands Water Partnership Program.

57.        Overall the Bank has had a fruitful dialogue and partnership with Pakistan inthe water
sector with major positive outcomes at the national and international levels, including the
conclusion o f the Indus Waters Treaty with India, the major infrastructure accomplishments
under the Indus Basin Project, the success o f the Salinity Control and Reclamation Program,
System Rehabilitation, evolution o f sector strategies and policies, and launching o f major
institutional reforms under the recently closed National Drainage Program Project. Key lessons
learned from past Bank operations in the water sector and recent experience with the Punjab
Imgation Sector DPLl and Education Sector DPCs, are that successful implementation o f
reforms requires:

         (0   Focus on instruments and incentives for reforms rather than simply on
              organizations, programs and projects.
         (ii)Anapproachbasedon "principledpragmatism"which recognizesthatreformsand
              investments must proceedinparallel;
         (iii)Strong political championship, government ownership, and commitment are
              essential for the success and continuity o freformprograms. This leads to highlevel
              monitoring and oversight, and creates a momentum in the system to focus on
              outcomes. Alignment o f vision and strategy among the key set o f policy makers and
              implementation teams i s essential. Financial and technical support o f an external

               conditions also need to be matched with champions at the implementation level,

               Analytical work prior to the program.

ANALYTICALUNDERPINNINGS

58.       Besides the CWRAS, the Bank's support to Punjab's ISRP has been developed on the
basis o f extensive analytical work undertaken by the Government both at the federal and
provincial levels. At the federal level, the Pakistan Planning Commissionpreparedthe Ten-Year
Perspective Plan (September 2001); the Ministry o f Water and Power prepared a Water
Resources Strategy (WRS), with the assistance o f the ADB in 2002, and a draft National Water
Policy (NWP) in2005 with resources provided under the NDP Project. The key recommendation
o f these analyses was that Pahstan needs to adopt a holistic approach to water management;
improve the governance o f scarce water resources; improve the efficiency o f irrigation; and help
ensure longterm sustainability o f irrigatedagricu1t~n-e~~.

Underpinningof EnvironmentalAspects

59.       As identified inthe Strategic Country Environmental Assessment (SCEA), finalized in
June 2006, Palustan has a comprehensive national policy and institutional framework for
environmental management inplace. The Pahstan Environmental Protection Act 1997, confers
broad-based enforcement powers to the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA)
and the provincial environmental protection agencies. The Pak-EPA Review o f Initial
Environmental Examination and Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, 2000 (BE-EIA
Regulations, 2000) provides the necessary details on the preparation, submission, and review of
initial environmental examinations and environmental impact assessments. The National
Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS)              define maximum allowable concentrations o f
pollutants inmunicipal and liquidindustrial effluents discharged to inland waters. The Pak-EPA
has published a set o f environmental guidelines for carrying out environmental assessments and
the environmentalmanagement o f different types o f development projects, including those inthe
protected and sensitive areas. According to the guidelines, irrigation and drainage projects
serving more than 15,000 ha require an EIA, while those serving less than 15,000 ha require an
IEE. An EIA is also normally required for projects in protected and sensitive areas, unless
advised otherwise by the regulatory agencies.

60.       The existing regulatory framework for environmental management and implementation
experience notwithstanding, the SCEA highlights a number of significant weaknesses in the
current administrative and implementation capacity. Principal among these are a ubiquitous
shortage o f trained manpower and insufficient budgetary allocations, a lack o f clear definition o f
roles, work plans and targets, and ineffective coordination and communications between federal,
provincial and local administrative entities.         The result i s that, while an appropriate and
necessary administrative capacity exists on paper, its effectiveness i s seriously curtailed in

practice due to these shortcomings. To help address these weaknesses, the Bank has shown its
willingness to provide assistance to the Ministry o f Environment and provincial environmental
agencies for the implementation o f the National Environment Policy 2005, which i s associated
with a significant increase inthe federal budget allocation for environmental management.

OPERATIONDESCRIPTION

61.        The purpose o f the proposedLoan i s to providecontinuedfinancingto the Province
of Punjab, to move forward with implementation of the ISRP, described in Section 111.
Based on the past experience, both GOPunjab and the Bank agree that the Development Policy
Loan (DPL) instrument i s a more suitable instrument for supporting the reform agenda than a
SIL.

62.        This operation would be the second in a programmatic series o f three Development
Policy Loans to support GOPunjab's medium-term program (ISRP) that i s linked to achieving
specific outcomes in the irrigation sector. The Bank's support would help ensure that key
reforms are successfully implemented by focusing on the right instruments and incentives. At the
same time, because o f its broader incidence and "budget support" nature, the DPL allows us to
engage at higher levels of Government on key policy reforms and enhance the leverage o f the
dialogue. The proposed Loan would use the window o f opportunity that continues to exist in
Punjab for creating incentives for both outcome improvements and overall performance in the
irrigation sector.

Status of PriorActions for DPL2, and Triggersfor DPL333

63.        Of the thirteen triggers set for DPL2 at the time of DPLl approval, eleven have
been converted into prior actions, without any change, by March 2007 (see Annex 5).
Regarding the remaining two triggers (both under Reform Pillar IV and relating to Apculture
Markets, and Agriculture Research) it has been agreed with GOPunjab that more time i s needed
for internal debate and review processes within the government and that these reforms would be
pursued outside the ambit o f DPL2. GOPunjab has assured the appraisal mission that these
reforms are supported at the highest level and will be completed within FY07. The Government
has prepared a Letter o f Sector Development Policy (Annex 1) which reflects the progress
already made under the ISRP and the program direction during the next year and beyond. The
prior actions taken and milestones achieved under DPL2, and the agreed triggers for DPL3 are
includedinthe Development Policy Matrix (Annex 2) and summarized below.

BENEFITSAND EXPECTEDOUTCOMESOFTHE ISRP

64.         Implementationo f the ISRP would yield benefits interms of:

     (i)Improvedfiscalandassetmanagementwouldsafeguardtheintegnty, andhelpensure
          sustainability o f Punjab's vital irrigation infkastructure, which i s the back bone o f its
          agriculture based economy.      Short term benefits would include adequate hnding for
          M&R and safeguarding against risks o f failure. Medium and long term benefits would
          include better maintenance and performance of infrastructure leading to more reliable
          and equitable water deliveriesto the tail ends o f the system (where a higher proportion o f
          the smaller land holdings and poorer sections of the farming community are located), and
          more efficient water use leading to higher productivity.
     (ii) Improved governance o f water resources and enhanced transparency o f the
          administration o f intra-province water entitlements and water distribution would lead to
          greater trust and confidence among water users. Short term benefits would include
          improved perception o f water users about administration o f water entitlements and intra-
          province distribution; fewer water related disputes among users; greater farmer
          confidence in the reliability and timeliness o f water deliveries, leading to greater
          investments in crop husbandry and productivity. Medium and long term benefits would
          include development o f water market leading to greater allocation o f water resources
          towards crops with higher economic value, through market mechanisms.
     (iii)Improved reliability o f irrigation service delivery, at the bulk transmission as well as
          distribution levels, with greater involvement o f users, would in the short term lead to
          improved equity of water distribution to tail ends o f canals, and an increase inwater use
          efficiency and productivity in the medium to long term.          Decentralization of water
          service delivery would also lead to improved O&M o f the lower end o f the irrigation
          system which i s currently the most dilapidated part o f the system. The ISRP will also
          encourage the entry o fnew players as bulkwater providers.
     (iv)The promotion of new and more efficient water technology (pressurized irrigation
          systems, laser guided land leveling, etc) through public-private partnerships would lead
          to higher efficiency o f water use, diversification towards higher value crops, increased
          productivity and morejobs as compared to conventional crops.


POLICY AREAS

65.         The policy areas supported by the proposed Loan and related challenges, government
actions, and triggers are articulated invarious sections o f the report and summarized inthe Policy
Matrix. Broadly speakmg, the key policy areas supported by the ISRP include: (i)        Policies that
would lead to improved fiscal and asset management, including policies for improved asset
management planning; adequate funding of M&R, reducing costs; divesting non-profitable lines
of business to the private sector; and O&M cost sharing principles, that make the use o f budget
and users charges for public and private goods more explicit; (ii)    Policies to improve governance
o f water resources, including more transparent administration of water entitlements, and
incentives for more efficient use of scarce water resources; (iii)Policies to facilitate
decentralization o f irrigation service delivery, with greater role o f farmers and other water users
in management, and incentives for improving equity o f water distribution and improved
operation and maintenance; and (iv) Policies for encouraging use o f improved and more efficient
irrigation technology through a system o f incentives for promotingpublic-private partnerships.

POVERTYAND SOCIAL IMPACTS

66.         While a macro-economic analysis (Poverty and Social Impact Analysis) o f the impact
o f the policy and institutional reforms supported by the ISRP has not been carried out3', the
reforms--improved asset management, water resource management, irrigation service delivery
and productivity-- supported under the proposed operation would have positive poverty and
social impacts (see Social Screening Matrix at Annex 4). In Punjab, most rural livelihoods
depend directly or indirectly on agriculture, and agriculture productivity depends importantly on
the availability o f water for irrigation - specifically the public provision o f canal water. Despite
the growth o f groundwater as an additional source o f water for irrigation, and its sale and
distribution in local informal water markets, canal water remains the critical and most important
source o f water for irrigation in the Indus plain.                  In this regard, the Pakistan Poverty
Assessment3*which was based on the Pakistan Rural Household Survey39found that:


          0     Ownership o f a plot within a watercourse command area confers access to irrigation
                water, but does not guarantee canal water availability.
          0     Water use appears to vary systematically with the location o f the watercourse along
                the main channel (distributary or minor) as well as the location of the farmer's plot
                on the watercourse command area                -  specifically, water availability decreases
                significantly if the watercourse i s located near the tail o f the distributary or minor,
                and/or ifthe plot i s located near the tail end o f the watercourse.

67.         This location effect is well known, butthe Assessment suggests that the interplay o f at
least two factors appears to be important inaffecting water availability:


          0     The first i s the deteriorated and silted condition o f many distributaries, minors and
                watercourses, and their related structures such as gates and outlets             - seepage losses
                along these canals are often high and their hydraulic performance low with the
                result that the system does not function as it was designed or intended, i.e., plots in
                different parts o f the command area, especially those near the tail o f canals would
                receive less water than was intended.
          0     Second, the Assessment found that when the data are controlled for plot location,
                the availability o f canal water increases significantly where farmers reported
                informal payments for water; where there is less inequality o f land ownership, and
                where the land holdings o f the three largest cultivators on the watercourse i s high.
                The Assessment notes that since larger landowners are likely to be able to lobby
                more effectively with irrigation officials and politicians, this latter finding suggests


37   Recent surveys, including the Pakistan Integrated HousehoId Survey 2002 and Pakistan Social Living Standards
     measurement Survey 2005, did not focus on land and farms. However, available data clearly indicates that the
     highestincidence ofpoverty is within agricultural labor and ruralnon-farmworkers and also that 91%o fthe small
     farmers are poor. ThePunjab P&D Department has indicated that it would consider expanding the scope of the
     next round of Multi-indicators Cluster Survey (`ICs) to establish more clear linkages betweenpolicies supported
     under the ISRP andpoverty.
38   Assessment o fPoverty inPakistan was undertaken by the Government and the World Bank and completed in
     September 2002.
39   The PRHS survey covered 2700 households in 16 districts. Since the data were collected at plot level, the sample
    includes 1500irrigated plots on about 400 watercourses (inRabi 2000-2001, and Kharif2000).


                                                         34

                  that water availability depends to some extent on the ability o f cultivators to
                  influence irrigation officials.

68.          The Assessment found hard evidence for three key findings:


           0      A significant percentage o f small farmers and tail-enders actually get less water
                  than their share;
                  Per-hectare water delivered to these farmers is significantly lower than that
                  deliveredto upstream farmers; and
                  There is widespread lack o f transparency inwater allocation.

69.          The lack o f transparency in water allocation i s important, and stems largely fi-om the
long-standing lack o f participationo f farmers inwater management decisions, combined with the
tendency of the departments over time to centralize management decisions, such as water
scheduling and distribution. These two factors over time have the effect o f greatly diminishing
transparency and information access. Addressing the above problems is a key objective of the
institutional and governance reforms, which Punjab has started aspart of its ISRP.

70.          One negative impact o f the ISRP would be redundancies in IPDresulting fi-om farmer
take over o f responsibility o f O&M o f distributary canals and abiana collection and transition o f
government tube wells. GOPunjab plans to deal with redundancies through a process o f natural
attrition as well as retraining and redeployment. The redundant staff would not lose employment.
They would either be absorbed in other vacant positions within IPD or other government
formations or transferred to the provincial "surplus pool" where they will continue to receive
salaries and benefits, till they reachthe age o fretirement.

71.          The proposed improvement inabiana recovery (improved collection) could impose an
additional burden on farmers4'. However, increased farmer participation in management o f
irrigation services will reduce the hidden costs o f water that farmers have to pay, and will likely
result ina single payment through abiana, which is less than the informal payments farmers have
been malung. Secondly, water charges represent a small fraction o f the farm budget41. Thirdly,
the fact that farmers pay a much higher price for groundwater transaction^^^ indicates their
willingness and capacity to pay for more reliable and timely water supply. The reforms will thus
have a positive impact on overall physical and financial sustainability o f the irrigation system by
gradually increasing abiana collection.


72.          Transition o f government tube wells could have a negative impact on water logging or
reduce access to groundwater. However, the transition i s being implemented in a manner that it
does not have a negative impact on water logging and salinity or reduce access to groundwater
for irrigation. The process followed successfully in past transition projects has been adopted,

     There is anecdotal evidence that small and marginal farmers generally pay abiana, and the defaulters are mainly
     influential farmers.
     Water charges represent about 5 percent o f cost o f agricultural inputs, and a similar percentage o fthe net farm
     income. Also, inPunjab, farmers in the tail reaches (outlets in last 33 percent o f canal length) are charged half the
     flat abiana rate.
     The Study on RuralFactor Markets (Report No. 30381-PK, dated November 19,2004) indicates that groundwater
    prices range from Rs 125 to Rs 240 per hour. A recent survey inthe LBDC command indicates that for diesel
     operated tubewells the groundwater price ranges from Rs 300 to Rs 350 per hour ,which i s several times higher
    than the current flat abiana rates inPunjab (Rs 50 per acre for the Rabi season and Rs 85 per acre for the Kharif
     season).


                                                           35

which involves social mobilization to organize handover o f operational fi-esh groundwater tube
wells to local communities, or replacing the large tube wells with smaller capacity community
tube wells (partly funded by government) which farmer groups can operate and maintain more
easily. Past experience has been that when these tube wells are managed by farmers they are able
to better meet their crop requirements while performing the drainage function as well. In the
Muzaffargarh canal command area, where most o f the remaining fresh groundwater government
tube wells are located, the timing o f the transition process was adjusted taking into account the
canal closure required for the emergency rehabilitationo f the Taunsa Barrage.

73.        IPD carries out annual maintenance o f canals in the month o f January, and for this
purpose, canals are closed and water deliveries for irrigation and drinking water supplies (in
saline groundwater areas) remain suspended during this month43. In addition, IPD also
undertakes additional canal closures, when required for special maintenance and rehabilitation
works. The planning and scheduling o f closures i s normally done by IPD in consultation with
the Agriculture Department and indirectly with farmers as well.                          However, in the past,
communications with the farmers were not fully effective and consequently some farmers did not
receive timely information. The reform program addressing this issue in two ways. Firstly, by
preparing and launching an effective communication strategy, which, among others, includes an
effective system o f consulting with, and informing farmers about canal closures, in a timely
manner". And, secondly, where special.cana1 closures are foreseen to have an adverse impact on
livelihoods o f small and marginal farmers, the government organizes programs for livelihood
assistance and focused poverty interventions before canal closure. This approach was adopted
duringthe 2006-2007 canal closures.

74.        The improvement o f equity in irrigation water delivery (Pillar 3 o f the reforms), may
have a negative impact on those who benefit from the current inequities in water distribution
(farmers as well as unscrupulous hnctionaries who engage inwater theft). It i s well known that
over irrigation, on the one hand, and water deficit on the other, both reduce water productivity
and income o f farmers. Head-end farmers suffer where over watering causes water logging and
salinity, while the tail-enders experience water stress. Therefore, restoration o f equity should
result ina win-win situation.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORINGAND EVALUATION

75.        The implementation o f the ISRP i s spearheaded by the Minister and Secretary o f IPD.
An IPD ReformUnit, assisted by four teams, each responsible for a reformpillar is responsible
for day to day monitoring and follow-up actions. An Inter-departmentalSteering Committee
headed by the Chairman P&D oversees program implementation, provides policy guidance and
secures political support and backmg.

Monitoringand Evaluation System

76.        GOPunjab has established a system for monitoring the implementation of the ISRP,
including the following four components:



43  For drinkingwater supplies, farmers store water intanks before hand or rely on truck mounted water tanks.
44 In2006, the canal closure information inrespect ofthe TaunsaBarragecanals was systematically and effectively
    disseminated to farmers prior to the scheduled closure dates. The government also supported installation o f
    additional hand pumps inareas where FGWwas available.

77.        The ReformUnit is responsible for: (a) strategic planning and implementation of the
reform program, including activities supported under the proposed DPL 2; (b) monitoring and
reporting on the key performance monitoring indicators, (c) maintaining close oversight o f the

               responsible for collecting and collating monitoring data relating to Pillar IV o f the
               ISRP.

78.        The Website Oversight and Monitoring Committee (WOMC) is headed by
Secretary IPD and includes representatives o f Agnculture Department, FOs, RSPs,
representatives o f academia and civil society, and PIDA officials, directly involved in social
mobilization for the establishment o f FOs. This WOMC helps ensure that the information
provided on the IPD website i s easily accessible, user friendly, clear, accurate and updated
regularly.

79.        The IDSC headed by the Chairman P&D, and with the Secretaries of Finance, IPD,
Agnculture, and Environment Protection Departments, and the Managing Director o f PIDA, as
its members, provides policy guidance and monitors overall outcomes o f the DPL. Secretary IPD
acts as the secretary o f the IDSC. The IDSC meets at least once every quarter or more frequently
whenever issues requiring resolution are submitted for its consideration. Its responsibilities
include: (i)  review quarterly DPL progress reports, evaluate outcomes, and ensure that the
various prior actions, triggers and milestones in the Policy Matrix are completed in a timely
manner; (ii)  provide policy guidance and advise implementing agencies how issues affecting
implementation can be overcome; (iii)    monitor assessment and collection o f abiana; (iv) ensure
adequate budgetary allocations for M&R, in accordance with the MTBF; and (v) assist IPD and
Agriculture Department in securing resources for buildingtheir institutional and communication
capacity.

OutcomeIndicators

80.         The expected outcomes, monitorable indicators (baseline values and targets) and
monitoring instruments are included inthe Development Policy Matrix.

IndependentThird-party Surveys(ITPS)

81.         While most monitoring aspects are amenable to internal arrangements, IPD Reform
Unit has recently contracted an independent external agency to conduct third-party surveys to
verify implementation o f program interventions and evaluate outputs and outcomes through
random surveys as well as case studies, including the following monitorable indicators, inter
alia:


          i The equity(measured bythe deliveryperformanceratios-DPR), timeliness of
                water distribution amongst members o f FOs, cost sharing and O&M arrangements,
                and performance on collection o f abiana;

          11    The performance o f IPD/AWBsand FOs inM&R o f the irrigation system;

                viability and sustainability; and

         V      Impact on small farmers, women, tenants, and landless.


82.         Bank Staff will also monitor critical actions and periodically review progress o f
implementation o f the reform program, as well as the subsequent actions o f the Government's
program. Bank staff will focus on the outcomes o f the program and the adjustments that need to
be made to the operation as it evolves, to take into account the latest developments, stakeholder
support, and feasible options for realizing the intended development goals. The focus o f these
reviews will be largely based on the monitoring o f outcome indicators and the objectives o f the
program. At the same time, the overall status o f the Government's program will be monitored to
determine whether the agreed prior actions and milestones are beingmet.

FIDUCIARYASPECTS

83.         Financial Management: As concluded in the Country Financial Accountability
Assessment - Pahstan (December 2003), there were substantial opportunities for consolidating
current reforms throughout Pahstan and for introducing additional reforms to further strengthen
public financial accountability. The challenge for governments at the national and provincial
levels i s to sustain policy level commitment to reform and set the pace for further implementation
o f measures designed to enhance the accountability arrangements in all tiers o f the governments.
As a further testimony to the commitment o f the GOPunjab, a Provincial Financial Management
and Accountability (PFMA) Assessment usingthe transitional PEFA framework (pre-June 2005)
was carried out for the Province and completed in April 2005 under the joint auspices o f the
DFID, World Bank, and the EC. This assessment captured and isolated the province-specific
accountability shortcomings and helped the province to design its own reform agenda that has


                                                 38

enabled the province to focus on implementing the required reforms which together are
enhancing the accountability regime at the sub-national level. The Assessment report indicated a
clear will o f the government o f Punjab to progress on financial management reforms as
evidenced by the scale and variety o f actions already underway under the auspices o f the Finance
Department and the PIFRA Project. Using the public financial management performance
measurement framework, the PFMA report concluded that the GOPunjab performed reasonably
well against the erstwhile 28 PEFA PFMPerformance Indicators.

84.        The measures already undertaken as outlined inthe achieved benchmarks inthe PFMA
assessment indicate that the province, as a whole, i s well geared to consolidating on the
achievements made so far and, through self-assessment, is already well positioned to track
further improvements or deviations in their reform implementation progress. This i s reaffirmed
through the commitment o f the province and by inclusion in the Punjab Government's White
Paper on the Budget o f the Provincial Government for FY 2006/07 o f the reform actions taken
and planned to be taken against each o f the PEFA Performance Monitoring Indicators. The
White Paper was presented to the Provincial Assembly and, in so doing the government has
demonstrated its will to transparently and accountably implement the required reforms aimed at
improving public financial management province-wide.

85.        Underlying the province's commitment to the reform agenda, achievements against the
milestones have been realized in the following areas: (a) the budget formulation process
continues to adopt a systematic policy o f orderliness and participation and this was evident inthe
well articulated and coherent `budget call circular' for the FY 2006/07 budget; (b) provincial and
district governments' daily cash balances are generally consolidated into a form of daily report
for effective cash flow planning and management, although public enterprises accounts and
Zakat accounts remain excluded; (c) consistent with the requirements o f the New System o f
Financial Control and Budgeting, the whole year's budget in the case o f recurrent expenditures
are released by the Finance Department and, similarly, at least 40% o f the approved annual
development program budget i s released at the start o f the fiscal year to support more timely
expenditure planning and commitments by Principal Accounting Officers; (d) since the budgeted
resources reach the spending departments on a timely basis, the spending departments have, in
general, now beguntheir commitment planning inadvance o freleases o f funds instead o f waiting
untilthe funds are released; this is particularly evident inthe IPD; (e) the pensionand provident
fund modules under the PIFRA regime are now activated and the process o f generating pension
and provident fund data for purposes o f ascertaining the contingent liabilities o f the
superannuation schemes for public employees has begun; (0timeliness indata reconciliation has
improved as a result o f the increase in number o f IT connected accounting sites in the province
although a lot remains to be done before province-wide connectivity i s achieved by September
2007; (g) the good practices o f introducing and replicating monthly expenditure monitoring
systems are being more aggressively adopted at the district government levels for development
programs although this improvement i s limited to a few districts at the moment; (h) the office o f
the Auditor General at the province has commenced the implementation o f the new risk-based
audit methodology that has started to support the enhancement o f audit quality and timeliness;
and (i)two Public Accounts Committees, operating inparallel, are functioning to support a faster
and timely review o f audit reports and audited accounts at the provincial level although there still
exists a significant back-log of unreviewed audit observations inthe audit reports and accounts o f
the province, and particularly for the district governments.

86.        Overall, as revealed by the Punjab PFMA (2005), the financial accountability
environment in the province provides adequate safeguards for reliance on government financial


                                                  39

management systems. This i s reinforced by the progress o f actions implemented since the IMF
Safeguards Assessment (2001) o f the State Bank o f Palustan (see below).              As a result, the
fiduciary risk o f the program continues to be rated as `modest'.

87.        With the enduring commitment o f the government o f Punjab to deepening reforms in
the area o fPFM, the multi-donor team was requestedby the government inthe first quarter o f FY
2006/07 to update the PEFA PFM Performance Measurement Framework, using the approved
Framework o f June 2005. The World Bank, ADB, DFID, and EC jointly commenced work on
the update and a draft of the report is now ready for discussion at the stakeholders' workshop.
This PEFA related work will be supplemented by a form o f `detailed diagnostics' o f the weak
performance areas with a view to government re-designing its own reform strategy for improving
on those identified areas. The government's will to include the strategy as part o f its White
Paper i s indicative, inno small measure, o f its responsiveness to advance the course o f reform in
PFM. The preliminary results o f the updated draft PEFA report show that the government has
already delivered on some o f the key areas o f reform outlined in the earlier report. Remaining
areas o f weakness that are being progressively managed but largely under the auspices o f the
PIFRA overarching reforms agenda include (a) the quality and timeliness o fthe in-year and year-
end financial reporting, particularly at district government levels; (b) slower roll-out o f the new
risk-based auditing methodology that i s compliant with International Standards on Auditing so
that presentation o f quality audited accounts and audit reports to the legislature is accomplished
within 12 months o f the end o f the fiscal year. Other key weakness requiring policy reforms
within the purview o f the both the provincial and federal government relate, principally, to the
negative institutional impact arising fi-om the `duality o f control' o f the district accounts officers
by both the Controller General o f Accounts at the federal level and the Finance Department at
the provincial government level.         Although improvements have been registered in the
reconciliation o f fiscal and monetary balances through improved cash management processes at
the provincial level, the reconciliation o f differences between expenditure `drawing and
disbursement officers' and the `accounting and payments offices' remains a source o f concern
that the PIFRA, when fully rolled out, i s geared to eliminate.

88.        An IMF SafeguardsAssessment o f the State Bank o f Palustan (SBP) was conducted
in 2001. It highlighted significant vulnerabilities at the SBP, particularly as relating to its
financial statements and disclosure policies which fell short o f acceptable Central Bank
standards. However, since a program o f reform has been agreed with the IMF and is being
implemented, the risks associated with foreign exchange management control have been
mitigated.    The SBP has transitioned to producing financial statements which accord with
international accounting standards and formats. An independent review o f the SBP's internal
audit function, as recommended by the Safeguards Assessment, has since been completed and
recommendations implemented. The SBP has also established a formal process o f reconciling
data reported to the Fundas well as implemented guidelines to prohibit operations that pledge or
encumber reserves, or place restrictions on, or otherwise impair the availability o f foreign
exchange reserves outside an authorized framework, equally, the SBP's Act has been accordingly
amended to strengthen and guarantee its independence and autonomy in the management o f
reserves as required under the Safeguards Assessment.

89.        The IPD, which will implement the program o f activities and policy actions under this
DPL, has an institutional and financial management framework that is premised on the
province's model. While there also remain accountability issues requiring the deepening o f
reform measures at the sectoral level, the potential for improvement and the commitment to



                                                 40

reform as demonstrated by actions taken during the first program period are great. The IPD, like
other government departments, is subject to the same accountability regime in the province; its
budget execution and internal control processes are generally satisfactory to support the
achievement o f the program's objectives.      External auditing o f the department's financial
transactions i s conducted by the Auditor General o f Pakistan through the Directors General of
Provincial and District Audits stationed in Lahore, Punjab.         Although follow-up of audit
observations was generally weak during the first DPL operation, there is now adequate evidence
to confirm that the Departmental Accounts Committee (DAC) of the Irrigation and Power
Department holds regular meetings (average o f twice monthly)to discuss and resolve audit issues
as a way to recognizing the importance o f accountability. At the same time, significant numbers
o f audit observations are resolved during those DAC sessions. The establishment o f a Cell to
monitor both the settlement o f audit observations issued against the department as well as the
status o f budget execution across the divisions and irrigation circles has heightened the
accountability prospects inthe department.

90.        Procurement Reform. The Government o f Punjab has developed and approved a
procurement strategy that addresses the following areas:

         Creation o f a central body to develop and guide the implementation and operation o f a
         new procurement framework which should include rules, regulations, procedures and
         standardbiddingdocuments.
         Identification o f key stakeholders and including them in the consultative process to
         ensure strong buy-infrom civil services, private sector and civil society organizations.
         Development o f a procurement monitoring system to collect, analyze and disseminate
         procurement related data within government and to the public, which will include web
         basedprocurement notices, and notices o f award o f all GOPunjab contracts.
         Development o f a complaint handling mechanism.
         Preparation of training and capacity building programs for individuals involved in
        procurement based on internationalbest practice.
         Creation o f benchmarks and a baseline study on current status of procurement and
         establishment o f key perfomance indicators.

The strategy aims at completing these actions within two years. In order to implement this
reform strategy, two committees have been set up, one under the Chairman P&D and the other
headed by Additional Secretary (Procurement). Each o f these committees has representation
from the second committee and has held several meetings to gain stakeholder alignment and
review progress in implementation. Inanother related development, GOPunjab, in response to a
request from the Prime Minister, is considering the adoption o f the Public Procurement Rules,
2004 o f the Federal Government's Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA). The rules
have been reviewed by the Bank and found to be in conformity with international best practice,
with only a second tier appeals or complaints handling process and consultancy specific rules
missing. GOPunjab has already adopted a good set of Guidelines for the selection o f consultants,
and should be able to very quickly adopt the PPRA rules. This will jump start the reformprocess
and quick progress can be made toward the creation o f a monitoring and evaluation system, and
downstream actions like preparationo fregulations, procedures and standard biddingdocuments.
GOPunjab has also finalized the draft o f an Act to establish a procurement regulatory body as
recommended by the procurement reform strategy which i s in the final stages of review by
stakeholder departments, after which, it will be forwarded to the Provincial cabinet for approval
to be placedbefore the Provincial Assembly.



                                               41

As part o fits reformprogram, the IPDis establishing a Procurement Unitto advise and assist in
procurement o f works, goods, and contract management. IPDhas also introduced a system o f
postingprocurementnotices on its website. Duringappraisal it was agreed that the IPDwill
decide on a threshold above which, procurement notices for goods, works and services, including
contracts for maintenance work, will be posted on the IPDwebsite and the availability o f this
information will be communicated to the public at large. At the same time, the IPDwill
commence work to post notifications o f awards on its website.

91.        OverallFiduciaryEnvironment: Overall, as revealedby the Punjab PFMA (2005),
the preliminary results o f the PEFA (2007) Assessment, and the monitored trajectory o f reforms
already initiated and are being implemented in the area o f public procurement, the fiduciary
environment in the province provides adequate safeguards for reliance on government financial
management systems. This i s further reinforcedby the progress o f actions implemented since the
IMF Safeguards Assessment (2001) o f the State Bank o f Palustan (see above). As a result, the
overall fiduciary risko fthis second operation continues to be rated as `modest'.


DISBURSEMENTAND FIDUCIARYASSURANCE

92.       Fundsflow arrangements for theLoan will be asfollows: The Government o fPalustan
shall identify a Foreign Exchange Account with the State Bank o f Pakistan (SBP) and which
forms part of the country's official foreign exchange reserves, into which the proceeds o f the
Loan will be disbursed on a single tranche basis upon Loan effectiveness.             The Rupees
equivalent o f the funds in the Account will, within two worlung days, be transferred into the
Consolidated Fundo f the Government o f Punjab (Account No. 1-Non-Food) held with the SBP
which i s usedto finance budget expenditures.

93.       Disbursements from the Consolidated Account No.1(Non-food) by the Government o f
Punjab shall not be tied to any specific purchases and no special procurement requirement shall
be needed. The proceeds o f the Loan shall, however, not be applied to finance expenditures in
the negative list as defined in the Schedule o f the Loan Agreement. If any portion o f the Loan i s
used to finance ineligible expenditures as so defined in the Schedule o f the Financing
Agreement, IBRD shall require the Government to promptly, upon notice from IBRD, refund an
amount equal to the amount o f the said payment to IBRD. Amounts refunded to IBRDupon such
request shall be cancelled from the Loan.

94.       Assurance Requirements for the Loan: For this Loan, since there will be no required
special fiduciary arrangement, no additional assurance requirement inthe form o f a formal audit
shall apply, particularly in the light o f the fiduciary environment as established with the
management o f foreign exchange reserves by the SBP. Within 45 days o f disbursement o f the
Loan by IBRD, however, the Finance Secretary o f the Province shall provide a written
confirmation to IBRD, certifying the receipt o f the Rupees equivalent o f the Loan into the
Consolidated FundAccount o f the Government o f Punjab, the number o f the account, the date o f
the receipt, and the exchange rate applied to translate the Loan currency into Rupees.

ENVIRONMENTALASPECTS
95.       The financing provided under the DPL will support a wide range o f improvements in
irrigated agriculture in Punjab through strengthening o f institutions, and the introduction of

expected results are improvements in the management o f asset stock, the management o f water
resources, irrigation service delivery, land productivity and water use efficiency. These
improvements are expected to lead to environmentally positive outcomes, including some
reductions inwater-logging and salinity.

96.        The on-going operations o f the IPD include maintenance and rehabilitation o f existing
main canals, branch canals, distributaries, and the drainage network. These activities present
localized, small-scale environmental risks, and may potentially affect the flow o f water to
wetlands. To address these concerns, the proposed loan supports strengthening o f the IPD's
Social and Environmental Management Unit (SEMU), which has already been established and
has a mandate to build awareness and capacity for environmental and social risk management in
the FOs and AWBs. The SEMU has prepared guidelines for the management o f environmental
and social risks in IPD operations with Bank's assistance. An important design consideration to
be addressed in theseguidelines was the need toprotect wetland habitats, some of which may be
critically dependent on seepagefrom canals. The guidelines therefore specifically address the
importance o f understanding any impacts on wetlands and the need to take appropriate action
where wetlands may be affected. Further, these Guidelines will also help in assessing the
potential changes in the hydrological regimes (quantity & quality aspects) and potential impacts
due to the project activities on natural resources including forests and grazing lands inthe area.
For the construction phase, the guidelines will ensure environmental safeguards by focusing on
the management of borrow areas, proper disposal of excavated materials, site restoration and
management o f associated canal closures. The guidelines will be disseminated through the IPD
website.

97.        The SEMU has also commenced a study o f water quality inthe surface drains in 2006,
with a focus on identifying pollution loads on the system. The Bank is ready to support the
preparationby IPD o f an integrated review o f the issues and challenges in one selected drainage
basin, through a Strategic Environmental Assessment. This assessment would incorporate a
comprehensive institutional review o f the sector, and will also address the need to protect water
quality in the irrigation system through tighter control o f pollution from industrial effluents,
municipal sewage, urban solid waste, and agncultural runoff. In this regard, a joint mechanism
between IPD and Punjab EPD i s needed for ensuring the effective compliance with the NEQS to
protect surface and groundwater resources.

98.        An Environmental Screening Matrix for the policies and reform actions supported
under the proposed loan i s attached (see Annex 3: Environmental Screening Matrix). Based on
this assessment and the preceding considerations, there will be no significant effects associated
with the proposed operation on the environment, forests andnatural resources.


RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
PotentialRisks and Mitigation Strategies

99.        At the time o f processing o f the first development policy loan the history o f uneven
high level support to the irrigation reform agenda was identified as a high risk. However,
GOPunjab has remained strongly committed to the reform program, which continues to receive
strong political support. Water userdfarmers also continue to participate in the implementation
of reforms with great enthusiasm and are witnessing the positive outcomes of participatory
irrigation management. While there remains an inherent risk that a change inpolitical leadership




                                                 43

could affect the current momentum, the reforms have reached the take-off point and there would
be pressures to move ahead. Continued Bank support, however, remains critical.

100.      There i s an inherent signzjkant risk that staff redundancies resulting from the
devolution o f O&M responsibilitiesto FOs coupled with anti-reform lobbying by those who may
stand to lose as a result o f the reforms (e.g. farmers who benefit from the current inequities in
water deliveries) may bring to bear political pressures on the government to slow down the
process o f change. GOPunjab i s mitigated this risk by adopting a strategy o f natural attrition as
well as retraining and redeployment. The redundant staff would not lose employment they would
either be absorbed in other vacant positions within IPD or transferred to the provincial "surplus
pool" where they will continue to receive salaries and benefits until retirement. Furthermore,
close monitoring, benchmarkmg i s being used to highlightthe positive outcomes o f the reforms
to win stakeholder support.

101.      Another significant risk is that IPDuses conventional methods for consulting with, and
informing stakeholders, which are not fully effective. However, as part o f this operation, IPDhas
developed a communication strategy to more effectively communicate with both internal and
external stakeholders. The strategy covers aspect o f change management as well, as reforms
proceed. A good start on communicating more effectively with farmers was made this year inthe
context o f Taunsa Barrage Rehabilitation.

102.      Another significant risk i s that IPD has limited capacity for managing social and
environmental issues associated with asset management activities. This riskis beingmitigated by
strengthening IPD's, A m ' s and FOs institutional capacity in these areas through training and
capacity building. Particular attention i s being given to addressing issues associated with canal
closures required for maintenance and rehabilitation activities. To identify and manage risks
associated with asset management activities including canal closure and rehabilitation and
maintenance activities o f the IPD, the S E W will conduct Initial Social Assessment (ISA) for
social screening o f M&R and rehabilitation works to identify any potential adverse social
impacts and suggest appropriate mitigation measures. An appropriate format for ISAs and
screening procedures has been developed as part o f the social and environmental guidelines,
which SEMU has prepared.

103.    There i s a moderate risk that adequate levels o f funding for maintenance and repairs
(M&R) may not be sustained. However, the fiscal situation in Punjab has improved and the
yardsticks for allocation o f M&R budgets have been rationalized. Adequate funding has been
allocated for FY06/07. Future M&R allocations would be made in accordance with the
Province's MTBF.

104.      Similarly, there i s moderate risk that IPD has limited capacity to effectively utilize
enhanced resources for M&R. This risk i s being addressed as part o f the asset management
planning, which among others allocates M&R funds takmg in to account the local needs as well
as implementation capacity. As part o f the asset management plan, a system o f performance
evaluation has been instituted to ensure that M&R funds are judiciously allocated, properly
utilized in a transparent manner with full regard to procurement and fiduciary safeguards,
downwards accountability to farmers. The outcomes and impacts will be closely monitored.

105.      There also exists a moderate risk from the weak financial management capacity at the
provincial level that could hamper implementation o f the reform program and its activities. This



                                                 44

risk is however mitigated by a series of factors, including enhancing IPD capacity and the
increasing level o f computerizationof financial transactions under the PIFRAregime.

106.      Another moderate risk relates to riparian issues. Construction o f new, as well as
remodeling of existing hydraulic infrastructure, involve careful consideration o f downstream
water rightdentitlements, and there are risks o f riparian issues arising. This risk i s mitigated by
the existence of the 1991 Inter-provincial Water Accord, which is administered by the Indus
River System Authority (IRSA). Intra-province water allocations and entitlements are also
covered by the Accord, and one key pillar o f the reforms supported by the proposed loan focuses
on greater transparency inadministrationo fintra-provincewater entitlements.

107.      Finally, there i s a moderate riskrelated to macroeconomic management. Although the
policy stance o f the government has remained appropriate, inflation and external trade deficit
indicate significant excess liquidity in the economy, and call for resolute actions to contain
money supply and improve export competitiveness. Inthis regard, the Government i s committed
to take necessary steps to ensure macroeconomic stability. The SBP has already taken steps to
tighten money supply.

         Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 061139 December 7,2006
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part o f the IMF's efforts to promote transparency o f
the IMF's views and analysis o f economic developments and policies. With the consent o f the
country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions o f Article
IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regonal
level, o f post-program monitoring, and o f ex post assessments o f member countries with longer-
term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions o f general
policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The
Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultationwith Pahstan i s also available

On November 22, 2006, the Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Pahstan.'

Background

Pahstan's recent economic performance has been impressive. Growth has accelerated,
improvements in public spending and wide-ranging structural reforms have reduced the debt
burden and increased efficiency, and pro-poor policies have helped lower poverty rates. The
devastating earthquake of October 2005 left a heavy toll in terms o f human lives and physical
and social infrastructure, but had relatively minor effects on macroeconomic indicators (except
for an increase ingovernment spending) owingmainly to the small share o f the affected areas in
the overall economy.

Economic developments during the fiscal year ending in June 2006 were favorable, with
buoyant real GDP growth and inflation declining to 7.6 percent. The external current account
deficit, however, increased to US$5 billion (3.9 percent o f GDP), from US$1.5 billion (1.4
percent o f GDP) a year earlier. Record-high net capital flows (mainly from foreign direct
investment-including    privatization) more than covered the larger deficit and allowed for a
buildup o fnearly US$I billion inofficial internationalreserves. The interbankmarket exchange
rate was broadly unchanged from end-June 2005.

The fiscal deficit exceeded the original budget target for 2005/06 owing to earthquake-related
spending. Excluding the latter, revenues and expenditures rose by roughly the same amounts
compared to the outturn in the previous fiscal year. The government debt-to-GDP ratio fell to
56percent by the end o f June, below the 60 percent ceiling stipulated in the 2005 Fiscal
Responsibility Law. The budget for 2006/07 targets a deficit o f 4.2 percent o f GDP (excluding
grants), unchanged from the estimated outturn for 2005/06.

The growth o f broad money and bank credit to the private sector decelerated in 2005/06, but
private sector credit continued to expand at a relatively strong pace. Bank lending rates became
increasingly positive in real terms as inflation declined; the real return on bank deposits
remained negative. The State Bank o f Pahstan's (SBP) claims on the government rose by more
than total government borrowing from the banhng system, as the SBP absorbed treasury bills
that commercial banks did not roll over upon redemption. In July 2006, the SBP tightened



                                                86

monetary conditions by raising reserve and liquidity requirements on bank deposits and the
discount rate.

Foreign investors' interest in Palustan increased significantly in 2005/06. Foreign direct
investment inflows, excluding privatization, rose by 70 percent, and foreign demand for
Palustani bonds was strong. Government divestiture from electricity and telecommunications
entities generatedlarge foreign exchange inflows and revitalized the privatizationprocess.

Progress on structural reforms, other than privatization, was mixed. Reforms to broaden the
income tax base and streamline rates continued, and the legal framework for investor protection
was strengthened. However, implementation o f the schedule of higher regional electricity tariffs,
a key step for continued reform of the power sector, remains pending, and progress on trade
liberalization slowed.

ExecutiveBoardAssessment

Executive Directors commended Palustan's impressive macroeconomic performance since 2001.
They welcomed inparticular the acceleration inoutput growth, the steady decline indebt ratios,
and the fall in poverty rates. Directors noted that Palustan's strong track record on the
macroeconomic and structural reform fronts had made the country increasingly attractive to
foreign investors, as shown by the record-high inflows o f foreign direct investment (FDI) during
2005/06 and the favorable terms obtained on recent sovereign bond placements in the
international capital markets.

Directors noted that during 2005/06 the Pakistani economy had withstood well the impact o f
large negative shocks, including the tragic earthquake o f October 2005, a sharp rise in
international oil prices, and unfavorable weather conditions. Although these shocks had limited
the scope for fiscal maneuver, growth had remained buoyant, inflation had declined slightly and
the import coverage o freserves hadremained stable.

Directors nonetheless noted the risks to the outlook, including the continued strength o f
domestic demand, and its adverse effects on the trade and current account deficits as well as on
the pace o f disinflation during 2005/06. They noted also the authorities' view that
macroeconomic imbalances would decline without the need for further changes inthe stance o f
policies envisaged for the current fiscal year, and welcomed the government's commitment to
tighten monetary policy, ifwarranted. However, most Directors felt that macroeconomic policies
during 2006/07 should be more effectively geared at reducing domestic demand and
strengthening the balance o f payments position. T o this effect, many considered that a further
tightening o fmonetary policy (including by allowinghigher cutoff rates at treasury bill auctions)
should not be delayed to help strengthen the external position and allow the government to meet
its inflation target. Most Directors considered that to be effective, monetary policy should be
supported by exchange rate flexibility and a fiscal policy that keeps this year's budget deficit
(excluding grants and earthquake-related expenditures) at least at the level o f 2005/06.

Directors stressed that, beyond 2006/07, Pakistan's macroeconomic policies should aim at
ensuring that the external current account deficit-to-GDP ratio remains on a declining path with
a steady build up o f reserves. Inthis regard, they encouraged the authorities to adopt a policy
stance that maintains real interest rates at positive levels accompanied by a close monitoring o f
credit growth, and a fiscal consolidation program that lowers the overall fiscal deficit to a
sustainable level over the medium term.




                                                 87

Directors viewed the favorable prospects for sizable FDIinflows as important for future gains in
productivity and investment, but also as presenting challenges for macroeconomic policy in the
years ahead. They highlighted that continued reliance on FDI inflows o f uncertain size and
timingwould require a large degree o f flexibility in economic policymaking. Inthis connection,
Directors stressed the need to improve the government's capacity to generate timely policy
responses to shortfalls o f external financing arising from negative balance o f payments shocks.
Directors were o f the view that those shocks should generally require monetary policy and
exchange rate responses, but also envisaged a role for fiscal tightening incases where the shocks
are large, or more permanent innature. Directors cautioned that the option o fresorting to the use
o f international reserves to cover shortfalls of external financing (especially those stemming
from delays inFDI-related flows) ought to be used sparingly.

Directors viewed structural reforms conducive to higher saving and investment, an improved
business climate, and well-targeted poverty-related spending as critical for sustaining growth
and poverty reduction over the medium term. They encouraged the authorities to quickly
complete the reform o f the regulatory and tariff framework for the power sector, and step up
efforts to broaden the tax base and further curtail tax exemptions. Directors also saw scope for
improving the government's debt management strategy, including by increasing the issuance o f
long-term marketable securities and reducing its reliance on treasury bills and the National
Savings Schemes (NSS) to finance the fiscal deficit. Directors welcomed the initiatives
underway to modernize the NSS and reform the system o f broker-financing o f stock trading, but
noted that these shouldbe followed quickly with measures that enable the integration of the NSS
with local financial markets.

Directors welcomed the authorities' commitment to maintaining a liberal trade regime and their
determination to contribute to the success o f the Doha round o f trade talks. They called on the
authorities to resist pressures to reinstate ad-hoc tariff and non tariff measures and broaden
export subsidy schemes.
Directors encouraged the authorities to further improve the quality and timeliness o f data,
including by reporting fiscal data on an economic classification. They also urged the authorities
to expedite the process o f subscribing to the Special Data Dissemination Standard.
