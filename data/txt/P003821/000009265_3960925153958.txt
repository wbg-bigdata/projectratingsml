PUBLIC WORKS MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2258-IND)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Public Works
Manpower Development Project in Indonesia for which Ln. 2258-IND in the
amount of US$30 million was approved on March 31, 1983.   The loan was
closed on December 31, 1988 one year behind schedule. The loan was fully
disbursed with the exception of US$170,000 and the last disbursement was
made in July 1989.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Population and Human Resources
Operations Division of Country Department V of the Asia Regional Office
(Parts I and III), and the Borrower (Part II).
The PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the
Loan Agreement, supervision reports, internal Bank documents and correspon-
dence between the Bank and the Borrower.

PUBLIC WORKS MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2258-IND)
Evaluation Summary
Obiectives
1        To upgrade Ministry of Public Works (MPW) staff and to provide
experimental training for contractors; to improve MPW's planning and
programming and management informa.tion systems and to strengthen senior
staff in management and financial areas (para. 3.1).
Implementation Experience
2        The project was generally implemented as planned, albeit with a
one year delay due to lack of progress in the first year of implementation
(para. 5.1). The exceptions to successful implementation were the failure
to bring about coordination of training throughout the Ministry, and the
application of the development of MPW planning capabilities (paras. 5.2 et
seq.)
Results
3        The project had a positive impact on MPW human resources devalL-
ment.   Training was strengthened, quality improved and the expansion in
training met SAR targets (para. 6.1). The result was less satisfactory for
the additional objective, added during project implementation, of strength-
ening the MPW Bureau (BSP) responsible for services to the construction
industries (para. 6.2).
Sustainabilitv
4        Project benefits, with the possible exception of short course
training, are expected to be maintained in the long term (para. 7.1). Due
to constraints in local rupiah funding, short term courses may have to look
to other sources of funding to sustain the program developed during the
Project when the follow-up Project (Loan 3112-IND) closes (para. 7.2). The
institution building carried out under the Project is expected to be main-
tained (para. 7.3).
Lessons Learned
(i) The danger of introducing additional components, unrelated to
the components of the project as appraised, at post appraisal
stage;



- iv -
(ii) the need to respect the formal framework of procedures in the
project cycle;
(iii) the need for formal review stages in complex TA components;
(iv)  the need for suitaole scheduling and staffing of supervision
missions; and
(v) the need to have a formal monitoring and reporting system at
the outset of project implementation (para. 8.3 et seq.).
From the Borrower's viewpoint the lessons learned were (i) the need for
competent counterparts; (ii) the need to keep Bank missions informed on
critical project problems; and (iii) the need to respect established
organizational procedures and lines of reporting (para. 9.3).

PUBLIC WORKS MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2258-IND)
PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.   Proiect Identity
Project Name:        Public Works Manpower Development Project
Loan No.:           Ln. 2258-IND
RVP Unit:           Asia Region, Country Department V
Country:             Indonesia
Sector:             Human Resource Development
Subsector:           Public Works
2.   Background
2.1      Sector Development Obiectives.   In support of the Ministry of
Public Works (MPW) policy of improving effective execution of the
Ministry's program through the upgrading of staff, the main objectives of
public works human resources development were:   the improvement of the
management of, and facilities for, MPW staff training; the provision of an
improved program of short courses for staff and experimental training for
contractors and foremen (mandors).   Secondary sector objectives were to
study program planning and information management in MPW and to strengthen
general management capabilities of the Government through provision of
fellowships for staff involved with development planning, financing and
related trainin,.
2.2      Policy Context.  At the time of appraisal MPW employed a staff of
about 111,000 which included about 12,000 permanent staff at central level,
70,000 at provincial level and over 28,000 temporary staff assigned to
specific projects.   In 1981, MPW staff were managing a development budget
of US$1.7 billion.   MPW began regular in-service training in the mid-
seventies in an effort to correct the imbalance between economic growth and
human resource development in Indonesia.  By 1981 the Ministry's training
budget was about US$7.4 million with courses in local u'niversities and
overseas accounting for 60% of expenditure; the remaining ..OZ was allotted
to short courses conducted by MPW.



- 2-
3.   Proiect Obiective and Description
3.1      Proiect Obiectives.  The main objectives of the project were to
upgrade MPW staff and provide experimental training to medium sized
contractors and mandors.   Se1.:ondary objectives were to improve MPW's
planning and programmlng and the management information system and to
strengthen selected senior staff in management and financial areas.
3.2      Proiect Comgonents.   To meet its primary objective, the project
provided for:
(a) strengthening the MPW Training Department and the Manpower
Planning Division of the Bureau of Personnel;
(b) establishing a Curricula and Materials Development Unit in
the Training Department;
(c) rehabilitating and expanding five existing training centers
and the construction of a sixth center; and
(d) delivering experimental courses for contractor and mandor
training.
3.3      To meet its secondary objectives the project provided for:
(a) a study with recommendations for improvements in program
planning and information management in MPW; and
(b) fellowships for selected civil servants in the fields of
management and finance.
4.   Prolect Design and Organization
4.1      The project was designed mainly by the Secretariat General of MPW
with the assistance of consultants.   Together with the Bank preparation
missions, the main issues affecting public works manpower development were
identified. The project brief reflected a clear conceptual foundation for
the project and at that stage all relevant parties were well briefed and
supportive of the project.
4.2      The project was innovative in so far as it was the first Bank
project to attempt a comprehensive manpower development and training
project for a Ministry. Previously, training had been assisted by the Bank
in specific projects and, apart from fellowships for post graduate study,
was generelly related to project components.
4.3      At the completion of the appraisal mission, the project had been
developed into a comprehensive and well integrated series of components
dealing with manpower development and training.  After the completion of
appraisal, the Ministry requested additional components for (i) developing
an MPW management information system (MIS); (ii) improving the Ministry's
capabilit'_ s for planning the public works program; and (iii) professional



resources development to be managed by the Overseas Training Office (OTO),
under the aegis of BAPPENAS.  The background and implications of the OTO
component were well understood by both GOI and the Bank.   However, the
implication of the MIS and planning components, which were unrelated to any
of the components appraised, were less well understood by both the Ministry
and the Bank. With hindsight it is clear that these two components needed
study in greater depth with the aid of relevant specialists, before produc-
tion of the final SAR.   It should be noted, however, that the requisite
study would almost certainly have meant a change in the project processing
timetable.
4.4      The timing of the project was appropriate in view of the inability
of the relatively new MPW training organization to develop its capacity to
deal with the conside:able manpower development problems facing the
Ministry.
4.5      By appraisal,  the roles and responsibilities of the agencies
responsible for the various project components were clearly defined and
interrelationships understood. The difficulty of the roles of the Training
Centers (PUSDIKLAT) and the directorate generals' training subcenters
(BIDANG DIKLAT) in coordinating training was identified as a project risk
in the SAR.  The difficulty was exacerbated during implementation by the
increasing   financing availaAe,  from the Bank and other agencies, to
Directorates General for project related training and the by-passing  of
the Bidang Diklat by some directorat-r in organizing such training.
5. Proiect Implementation
5.1      Project implementation was delayed at the outset through the need
to have consulting contracts cleared through Sekretariat Negara (Sek N.g)
which did not understand the nature of the project.  The role of Sek Neg in
contract approval has since been abolished.   The Professional Resource
Development component was seriously delayed due to indecisions caused by a
proposal from another agency to finance a large project similar to the
component.  The delay in this component largely caused the need to extend
the loan period by one year.
5.2      With three exceptions, the project was generally implemented as
planned, aloeit with a one year delay.   The exceptions, were (i) the
failure to bring about coordination between PUSDIKLAT and the Bidang
Diklat, (ii) the implementation of the MIS, and (iii) the development and
implementation of the improvement of MPW planning capabilities. The lack
of strong central support and the lack of a commitment of the three
Directorate Generals were responsible for not realizing the coordination of
the whole MPW training program. This was identified as a risk in the SAR.
The objective of coordinating training was fully justified. The increasing
unchecked autonomy exercised by each of the three Director Generals, which
frustrated any efforts at coordination, could nco have been foreseen during
project preparation.



5.3      In early 1985 the Ministry requested that the objective of
improving the service of BSP (the MPW Bureau responsible for construction
industry development) be added to the project.   The services included
assistance to state owned contractors, development of standard conditions
of contract and bidding procedures, the collection of data on the construc-
tion industry and general guidelines on corporate financial and cost
control systems for contractors.  The additional objective arose from the
dissatisfaction of the Ministry with the performance of publicly owned
contractors and was seen by senior Bank management as a useful exercise in
preparing the ground for a future project to assist the general construc-
tion industry. The additional component received attention from Bank staff
involved in construction industry matters.   Communications were directly
between such staff and BSP without involving the PMU at the Ministry or the
Bank division responsible for the project.   The Bank involvement in the
additional component decreased significantly after terms of reference and
TA contracts were drawn up.  Thereafter supervision was, at best, sketchy
because the responsible project division was not briefed on the components
and responsibility for supervision of the component was not clarified by
its designers.
6. Proiect Results
6.1      The project had a major positive impact on MPW human resource
development. PUSDIKLAT and the Regional Training Centers were considerably
strengthened through the creation of fourteen and thirteen new staff
positions respectively, and the training quality improved through better
qualified instructors and new training materials.   Training under the
direct control of PUSDIKLAT was coordinated.  Comprehensive curricula and
related training materials were produced and introduced in an expanded
program of short courses (see Part III). Some 30,000 staff from PUSDIKLAT
and the three Directorates General received short term training ranging
from one week to one month.   Personnel management was greatly improved
through the introduction of computerized inventory and staff tracking
systems and related staff training. The project was successful in improv-
ing the Bureaus of the Secretariat General involved in the project with the
exception of the Bureau of Planning.
6.2      The project was less successful in achieving the objective of
strengthening BSP services to the construction industry.
7. Proiect Sustainability
7.1      Project benefits, with the exception of the short course training
program, are expected to be maintained in the long term.  To sustain the
benefits of the short course training program adequate incremental funding
is needed to cover the cost of trainee attendance, the development and
updating of curricula and training materials and the operation and main-
tenance of the training centers.



7.2      Due to constraints in local rupiah budgeting it is likely that, in
the short term, adequate funding would not be available from routine
budgets and would have to be augmented by loan assistance to sustain the
program at the level achieved during project implementation.  A follow-up
project, Public Works Institutiornal Development and Training (Ln. 3112-IND)
has allocated funds to sustain the program through 1994.
7.3      The benefits of the institution building carried out under the
project in PUSPIKLAT and the Regional Training Centers are expected to be
maintained in the long term.  The follow-up Project (Ln. 3112 IND) will
further consolidate these institutions.
8. Bank Performance
8.1      The  Bank performed well  from project  preparation  through
appraisal.   The issues relating to manpower and training were identified
and adequately treated. The Bank performed less well between appraisal and
final SAR when the additional planning and MIS components were introduced.
The complexity of the relationships inherent in these components was not
identified; the terms of reference provided for no formal interim reviews
and the components were unrelated to the comprehensive manpower and train-
ing package developed at the appraisal stage.
8.2      The Bank faltered in its supervision at a crucial stage in the
project.   In 1985 the Bank's supervision effort suffered from a lack of
continuity and a slackening of intensity.   During this time, Bank effort
was concentrated on developing the additional BSP component.   The BSP
compcnent caused confusion in communications and in the PMU procedures.
The results of the component were mixed with unsatisfactory results in
those subcomponents with flawed terms of reference and unreasonable expec-
tations.  However, following Bank reorganization and the focus on country
departments, the possibilities of a repeat of these circumstances are very
much reduced.
8.3      The main lessons which may be relevant to other Bank financed
projects are:
(a) the danger of introducing additional components at a late
stage unrelated to the objectives and contents of a carefully
appraised project;
(b) the need to respect the formal framework of procedures in the
project cycle;
(c) the need, in complex technical assistance components, for
formal review stages during the consultant's development work
and the need to arrange that proper expertise is available to
the Borrower to carry out these reviews;
(d) the need for suitable scheduling and staffing of supervision
missions to ensure that the project is supervised during
critical periods in project implementation; and



(e) the need to have a formal monitoring and reporting system at
the outset of project implementation.
8.4      The lessons learned from the project have been implemented in the
follow-on project (Ln. 3112-IND) in so far that no project changes was made
after appraisal, formal sLage reviews have been built in to the main tech-
nical assistance components and provisions have been made to have relevant
expertise available to the Ministry to carry out the reviews within the
available periods and a project monitoring and reporting system was agreed
between the Bank and Ministry before implementation started.
9. Borrower Performance
9.1      The Borrower's performance was somewhat similar to that of the
Bank in that it performed well in project preparation up to the appraisal
stage but later with the components added after appraisal the Borrower
failed to make provision in project preparation for the complexity of the
relationships inherent in the additional components.
9.2      The Borrower performed well during implementation except, again,
for the components added after appraisal. Counterparts for the components
were weak or non-existent, consultants operated virtually independently in
the additioral components of programming and planning and the strengthening
of BSP. The PMU performance in the main pr3ject components was good, par-
ticularly in the context of its difficult and widespread responsibilities.
9.3      The main lessons for the Borrower are:
(a) the need to ensure that competent counterparts, and where
necessary, expertise to assist the counterparts, are allotted
to technical assistance consultants; terms of reference
should be prepared for the counterparts and their performance
formally evaluated during implementation;
(b) the need to be more assertive with Bank supervision missions
in ensuring that missions are informed of and act on critical
project problems; and
(c) the need to insist that established organizational procedures
and lines of reporting are respected.
10.   Proiect Relationships
10.1     The Bank-Borrower relationship was effective and amiable in the
major project area of staff development and training.   However, it was
inadequate in the case of two components (Bureau of Planning and BSP)
largely due to the weak relationships between PMU and the PIUs for these
components.   Both the Bank and the Borrower had effective relationships
with other government agencies.



-7-
11.   ConsultinR Services
11.1     The role of contractors and suppliers was relatively minor in the
project. Consultants played a major role with mixed results. Where compo-
nents were monitored, performance was adequate though a formal system of
periodic evaluation might have improved performance.  Consultancy results
were not satisfactory where there was little monitoring or where consul-
tants had to work to impractical terms of reference which the relevant
consultants apparently accepted without demur.
11.2     Consultancy contracts were based on reimbursement of staff months
provided.   In some cases the allotted staff months were exhausted before
the targeted result was achieved in final form and extensions were given in
some of these cases. It may be that where tasks can be adequately quanti-
fied, and specified on a performance basis, lump sum task payments rather
than staff months reimbursement would produce more effective results.
12.   Project Documentation and Data
12.1     The legal agreements proved adequate and the SAR was the main
reference for Bank and Borrower during implementation.
12.2     The data for preparation of the PCR were not readily available due
to the lack of a reporting system common to the Bank and Borr'wer and due
to weakness in reporting by some PIUs. In the absence of a formal system
lapses in reporting were not readily identified during implementation and
this resulted in some difficulty in getting data for PCR preparation.
12.3     The main lesson is that an integrated Bank/Borrower project
reporting system fulfilling the needs of both should be established before
implementation.  This lesson has been taken into account in the follow-up
loan (Ln. 3112-IND), Public Works Institutional Development and Training
Project through a mutually agreed integrated reporting system for common
use by the Ministry and the Bank.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1.       The adequacy and accuracy of the factual information contained in
Part III of the PCR is confirmed.
Comment on the Analysis Contained in Part I of the PCR
2.       The  additional  component  requested  by  the  Ministry  for
(a) developing an MPW Management Information System (MIS), (b) improving
the Ministry's capabilities for the planning of the public works programs,
were important requirements of MPW in improving planning capabilities and
implementing a MIS.  This component actually was well understood but the
implementation of the results still needs to be improved. The MPW needs to
have a comprehensive and integrated planning system.
Projlect Implementation
3.       The  coordination  of training activities  still needs  to be
improved.  It is not a problem in terms of coordination between PUSDIKLAT
and Bidang Diklat but there are difficulties in Badan Diklats to achieve
full coordination with their Directorates.
Bank Performance
4.       The preparations for this project were satisfactorily set up by
the Bank. All components involved were clearly analyzed at appraisal.
5.       The presence of the Bank mission considerably  supported the
project performance especially in determining the immediate actions to
solve problems at once or to solve delayed matters.   It is worthwhile to
mention for example the decisions of reallocating the loan and amending the
loan percentages and loan extension could be quickly agreed at the meeting
during the represence of the IBRD mission. The decision made by IBRD, in
some cases were not always consistent in dealing with administrative
matters.   For example,  in the early period of implementation the Bank
indicated that an audit report was acceptable on a PIU basis.   But at a
later stage consolidated audit reports were required by the Bank.   The
payment advices from the Bank sometimes arrived late at Bank of Indonesia
resulting in a bigger commitment fee payment than necessary.
6.       In conclusion  the Manpower  Development  Project  received
considerable support from the Bank.  The role of the Bank missions proved
very supportive for the running of the project.   The Bank missions also
contributed in quick decision making and consistent planning. Therefore,
the project considerably benefitted from the Bank's support.   RSI/World
Bank representatives were regarded as supporting elements to the project.

Borrower Performance
Preparation of Prolect
7.       The Manpower Development Project (MDP) was the first project to
handle Manpower Development with objectives to support the Department of
Public Works in areas such as:
(a) Management of MPW Staff Training Activities,
- Development of Diklat in planning and management staff
training,
- Development of Information System,
- Development of Manpower Planning,
(b) Curricula and Material Development Unit,
(c) Training for small contractors and mandors,
(d) Regional Training Centers (RTC).
8.       Even when preparations have been satisfactorily undertaken, there
are possibilities that additional programs may appear during the develop-
ment of the project. Nevertheless such alterations may still be within the
scope of the overall project. Alterations and additions to such programs
are subject to the increased demand for new programs within the course of
the project implementation.  Such alterations included additional subcom-
ponents as follows:
1. Institutional Trainint Development for the Insilectorate
General. This program was aimed at improving the capability
of the staff members and data/information flow.
2.  Strengthening Public Contracting Corporation.  This component
was designed to strengthen the competency of the engineering
and managerial staff of publicly owned construction companies
in areas of recognized weaknesses through technical
assistance.
3.  Standardization of Contracts.   Standard  formation of
documents to be used for ICB procurement of Consultant
Services and Construction Works.
4.  Pusbinlat  (Center  for  Development  of  Trainint for
Construction Industry.   Consultant services to assist
Pusbinlat to identify its institutional, staff development
and resources needed and to identify other priority training
needs of the construction industry.



- 10 -
9.       Programs as above mentioned through the adoption of additional
components, might influence the implementation of project components
previously determined. In this case the additions had no harmful influence
on the components in the original project.  Although several alterations
and additions have been made to the program, no serious deviations are
apparent.   The additional programs have still great relevancy to the
appraised project.
Lesson Learned
10.      The lesson learned from implementation include:
(a) More adequate preparations should be made for the overall
project especially by MPW staff during the period from SAR to
implementation,
(b) The project coordination should be accompanied with
sufficient  authority to be extended to the MPW.   The
mechanisms of relationships were not always understood among

(c) An agreed formal monitoring and reporting system is very
