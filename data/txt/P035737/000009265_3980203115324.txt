Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
(i) supporting the long term process of building up the country's institutional capacity to administer and maintain rural
roads; (ii) improving the rural road system in the ZONAPAZ Region, Department of San Marcos (where the Govermnent is
focusing a major post-conflict development effort), critical to providing access to social and other public services and
fostering economic development through integration to markets; and (iii) continuing to improve the efficiency of the main
and secondary road networks.
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):
(i) development and implementation of a national rural roads and transport strategy; (ii) implementation of a pilot rural
roads component in the Department of San Marcos in the western part of the ZONAPAZ Region using innovative
institutional arrangements for maintenance and rehabilitation; and (iii) continued support, begun under an ongoing operation
(Loan. 3002-GU), for rehabilitating the main and secondary road network. The project will be co-financed with OECF of
Japan. The following table summarizes total costs by component; a breakdown of costs supported by the Bank loan is
available in Annex 3.

PART A - Rural Roads
A.1 National Rural Roads and Transport Strategy                       Institution         0.5    0.4%
Development and gradual implementation of a national rural roads and  Building
transport strategy, through a participatory process that brings together the
main stakeholders in the rural transport subsector. The strategy will aim to
calrify: (i) the legal and institutional arrangements for ownership and
management of rural roads; (ii) funding arrangements and cost sharing
mechanisms for financing of rural roads construction, rehabilitation and
maintenance; and (iii) the role and functions of the national, municipal, and,
local level in setting standards and coordinating rural roads and transport.
A.2 Rural Roads Pilot Component                                                          29.7   21.8%
The pilot project will focus on the highland Department of San Marcos (the
Altiplano Marquense), one of the poorest and most remote areas in
Guatemala, which was seriously affected during the years of civil conflict.
The pilot will test innovative institutional arrangements to improve and  Physical       24.8
maintain the various levels of the rural road network in this Department.
The pilot has three distinct sub-components: (i) rehabilitation of the national
and key departmental routes in the Altiplano Marquense; (ii) testing of new.   Institution  3.8
technologies for cost-effective strengthening of the surface of rural roads;  Building
and (iii) piloting a new institutional framework for the management and
financing of municipal rural roads, involving both the development of local
contractors and microenterprises to rehabilitate and maintain works, and the
private consulting industry to manage municipal roads.                  Other              1.1
At the national level, the Ministry of Communications, Public Works
Transport and Housing (MCTOPV) through its Roads Directorate (DGC),
will be responsible for sub-components (i) and (ii), while the Municipal
Development Institute (INFOM), with the participation of the municipalities,
will be responsible for sub-component (iii). Institutional arrangements will

also involve municipalities, communities and the private sector. This pilot
national scale, a strategy for decentralizing the administration of rural roads
to local govermnents.
Consultant services will be provided to assist with the implementation of the
pilot project, the preparation of final engineering designs and the supervision
of the works. A limited amount of office equipment, vehicles and tools will
also be financed under this component.
PART B. Main and Secondary Roads                                                       88.5      64.8%
B.1 Main and Secondary Road Rehabilitation
This component, cofinanced by OECF, will continue the ongoing Bank     Physical
support to the country's main and secondary road network through the
rehabilitation/improvement of approximately 370 km of roads included in the I
Government's road investment program;

3. Benefits and target population:
The expected benefits are: (i) long term improvements in the way rural roads are administered in Guatemala; (ii) better
access to health, education and other public services for the predominantly poor population in the ZONAPAZ Region; (iii)
improved access to markets and inputs for agricultural producers in the ZONAPAZ Region, and the consequent stimulation
of economic activity and incomes; (iv) reduced transport costs on the main transport comndors and the resultant removal of
constraints to economic activity, particularly within transport intensive industries; and (v) increased employment, both from
the transport-induced economic activity as well as from the direct employment effects of the increased road construction and
maintenance works. In terms of quantifiable benefits, the net present value at 12% exceeds US$40 million and is clearly one
of the more beneficial investments that the Govermnent can undertake now.
The target population is: (i) the country as a whole, which benefits from a better administered rural roads system and from
an improved road network along the main corridors; and (ii) the rural poor of ZONAPAZ Region who currently lack
adequate access to public services and markets.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
lmplementation period: Five years (1998 - 2003).
Project coordination: The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) established in the MCTOPV to coordinate the activities of the
ongoing Bank Loan (3002-GU) will have the overall coordination responsibility for the new project. The PCU has been
incorporated into the permanent administrative structure of DGC (under the Planning Division). It directly assists the
Planning Division in matters related to the preparation of multiyear investment programs and in the coordination of the
projects financed by the Bank and the IDB. To support the PCU's increased worldoad, the project includes financing for
consultant services during the implementation of this project;

Country: Guatemala          Project Title: Rural and Main Roads Project
Executing agencies: There will be two national level executing agencies, INFOM and MCTOPV. INFOM, with support
from MCTOPV/DGC, will have primary responsibility for developing the national rural roads and transport strategy, and
for overseeing the Pilot municipal and community roads component which will be the responsibility of the Association of
Municipalities. INFOM has experience coordinating national and local development efforts, and has been performing a
similar function in the water sector. At the local level, INFOM will assist the 12 municipalities in the Altiplano Marquense
to implement a new scheme for the management and financing of municipal and community roads. These municipalities
have formed an association (Asociacion de Municipalidades del Altiplano Marquense) to pursue the development of their
area. The association will contract out the planning, programming and management of the municipal roads within their
boundaries to consultants, who will constitute a permanent technical service unit (Unidad Marquense de Asistencia Vial-
UMAV). The technical unit will also prepare, let and manage contracts on behalf of the members of the association. The
association will have a Board made up of representatives from the member municipalities, and the technical unit will report
to the Board. Technical assistance will be financed under the project to strengthen the association and empower its Board to
assume its responsibilities effectively. Technical assistance will also be provided to the technical unit to ensure the
establishment of adequate systems and procedures. Also, technical assistance will be provided to the regional and national
offices of INFOM in order to strengthen their capacity to support these local level development efforts.
MCTOPV, through its Roads Directorate (DGC), will implement the main and secondary roads component of the project
(Part B) as well as the national and departmental roads sub-components of the pilot component (Part A). DGC has
improved its implementation capacity considerably during the last years with the assistance of the Bank under the ongoing
project (Loan 3002-GU), the IDB and other institutions, and currently possesses the capacity to successfully assume these
responsibilities. DGC has reduced its staff from 20,000 to 5,000 in the last 4 years and introduced the use of private
contractors in road maintenance activities. Currently, contractors perform 100% of the maintenance on the paved network
and 40% of the network classified as unpaved. A law creating a road maintenance fund was passed in December 1996. The
fund is supported by a fuel surcharge which provides a steady source of financing for road maintenance. To date, the fund
has operated efficiently and an additional increase in the fuel surcharge will become effective early in the new year in order
to increase the maintenance coverage of the network under DGC's responsibility. As a next stage in the strengthening of
DGC, the project will provide technical assistance to its 14 regional offices (Zonas Viales) to review their functions and
initiate the implementation of their changed roles in an environment of privatized road maintenance activities.
Accounting. financial reporting and auditing arrangements: Both executing agencies, INFOM and DGC are adequately
staffed and equipped to carry out their basic functions; the project will include technical assistance to further strengthen
their financial management systems. Pursuant to normal Bank practice, an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank will
be contracted to carryout annual audits of the project following international audit standards. A multi-year audit contract
will be used to avoid the need to go through the consultant selection process annually, which often is the main cause of
delays in the preparation and submission of the reports, and to ensure consistency on the presentation of the audit reports.
Project accounts, special accounts and SOEs will be audited annually and the report will be submitted to the Bank within
five months of the end of each fiscal year. The Bank's Financial Accounting and Reporting and Auditing Handbook
(FARAH), published in January 1995, would be used by the auditors in accordance with current Bank guidelines.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: For rural roads, there is currently little or no systematic monitoring and
evaluation. Developing such a system will be one of the key contributions of this project, and this will start with the
monitoring of the Pilot component. Consultants, with the participation of the INFOM, DGC, the association and the
communities within the pilot project have been retained to develop indicators to evaluate and provide information on: rural
roads conditions; beneficiary participation; population served; road contractor performance and development; staffing and
training for municipal, INFOM and DGC managerial units; and planning, programming and budgeting. Surveys will be
carried out to determine the effects of road improvements on agricultural production, transport costs, school attendance and
the use of health and social service facilities.
The Bank, INFOM and DGC will conduct formal reviews annually of the progress made in meeting the project's
development objectives. Participants in these reviews will include: the Governor of the Department of San Marcos; the

mayors of the municipalities included as pilots; Consejos de Desarrollo; a sample of beneficiaries; transport operators;
NGO's; and DGC. The Pilot component's implementation schedule and monitoring indicators will be updated during these
reviews.
For the main roads component and for the project as a whole, the Planning Division of the DGC, through the PCU and
INFOM, will prepare and submit to the Bank semiannual progress reports on the entire project. These reports will be sent to
the Bank within one month after the end of each semester and will describe: (i) progress during the previous semester in the
implementation and in the achievement of the objectives of the proposed project based on the performance indicators; (ii) an
assessment of the problems and issues derived from the implementation of the project; (iii) updated implementation and
disbursement schedules for the following semester; and (iv) status of compliance with the legal covenants contained in the
Loan Agreement.
The Bank will carry out about 3 full supervision missions annually. In addition, a mid-term review of the project would be
carried out in the year 2001. An average of about 20 staff weeks would be required to supervise this project annually.
Finally, MCTOPV will prepare and submit an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) on the project within six months of
the loan closing date (6/30/2003).
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objectives supported by the project:
Document number and date of latest CAS discussion: Report 1445 1-GU of May 30, 1995.
The 1995 CAS for Guatemala focuses on poverty alleviation, with special attention to support for the peace process. A new
CAS is under preparation and will be presented for Board consideration in March 1998. It endorses the main themes of the
earlier CAS and proposes new local development initiatives, particularly in the western part of the ZONAPAZ Region
(Department of San Marcos). Improving road access for rural areas where the poor population affected by conflict are
concentrated, is a critical part of the poverty alleviation strategy. Road rehabilitation and maintenance are essential for
integrating the poor and largely indigenous rural communities into the modern economy, improving their access to public
services, accelerating growth and consolidating peace. The project has benefited from prior economic and sector work on
Guatemala, including a Poverty Assessment (Rep. No. 12313-GU, 1995) and Investing for Peace: A Public Investment
Review (Rep. No. 16392-GU, 1997).
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Small network: Guatemala's classified road network is relatively small (14,000 km). It comprises nearly 4,000 km of main
and secondary roads (mostly paved) and 10,000 km of tertiary and rural roads (mostly unpaved, collector roads). This
infrastructure base is weak, even when compared to other Central American countries. For example, Costa Rica, although
less than half the size of Guatemala and with shorter inter-city distances, has a classified road network that is more than
twice as large (35,600 Iam). Similarly, although Costa Rica's population is a little over one-third of Guatemala's, its road
service index (11.1 km of roads per '000 persons) is many times higher than Guatemala's (1.2 km of roads per '000
persons). The situation is particularly serious in the rural areas where, for example, the 12 municipalities in the pilot project
have only 0.8 km of classified roads per '000 persons, all of which are in poor condition and largely impassable during the
rainy season.
Poor condition of road network: The Government, with the assistance of the Bank (ongoing Loan 3002-GU) and other
donors, has been working to eliminate the rehabilitation backlog on the country's main and secondary road networks. To
date, considerable progress has been made in this regard. Starting with a relatively low 25 km of completed road
rehabilitation in 1995, the Government has taken steps to increase the completed kms to 45 in 1996 and most likely to about
100 in 1997. However, a significant part (5 8%) of the main and secondary road network is still in need of rehabilitation.
Consequently, transport costs remain high and service unreliable on large parts of the system. In a country with



Project Appraisal Document                                                                            Page 6
Country: Guatemala           Project Title: Rural and Main Roads Project
mountainous terrain, long inter-city distances and no economic alternatives to road transport for most freight and passenger
traffic, the road infrastructure is of major importance for growth and sustainable development. The proposed project would
help eliminate about 15% of the current backlog in rehabilitation.
Multiple agencies and unclear responsibilities in rural roads: The rural roads sub-sector is characterized by a large number
of financing and implementing agencies, many of whom apply different standards for the same type of road. The outcome is
an array of ad hoc, often insustainable interventions. Inadequate rural road access makes it difficult to deliver education,
health, and other public services to the rural population, and constitutes a major disincentive to the production of surplus
crops, increase in rural productivity and incomes. The Government's plan to improve the administration of rural roads
entails the decentralization of several DGC services, the gradual transfer of some of these functions to local governments and
the strengthening of their capacity to effectively assume these additional responsibilities.
Main roads strategy exists but a straterv for rural roads is lacking: Guatemala's strategy for the entire road sector is
contained in the "Plan Maestro Nacional de Transporte" (PMNT) which was prepared with the Bank's assistance under
Loan 3002-GU. Based on the PMNT, DGC prepared a four-year investment program (1997-2000) for the road sector,
identifying key investments, maintenance needs and funding sources. The program supports (i) the decentralization of the
management of the road network; (ii) the reorganization of MCTOPV and, more specifically, of DGC; (iii) increased
involvement of the private sector, particularly in road maintenance activities; (iv) the improvement of the road network
through the rehabilitation of 2,000 km of main and secondary roads and the construction and rehabilitation of 1,000 km of
rural roads; and (v) the implementation of a road maintenance program to cover the periodic and routine maintenance of
1,000 km of rural roads. The PMNT however, does not address the many problems which affect the rural roads sub-sector.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The major issues that will be addressed under the project are:
(i) Strengthenmng capacity to administer and maintain rural roads: The country's capacity for administering and maintaining
rural roads will be strengthened through the knowledge gained from the pilot component and the replicability of successful
approaches, and from the formulation and implementation of a national rural roads and transport strategy. The
Government's plan to improve the administration of roads entails the transfer of responsibilities to local governments and the
strengthening of local government's capacity to carry out those responsibilities.
(ii) Imnproving aencv coordination: Particularly in the case of rural roads, the project will, through the support to the
development of a national strategy for rural roads and transport, contribute to a more coherent set-up for the management
and financing of rural roads which would also bring increased coordination among donors and agencies in the rural roads
sector.
(iii) Reducing transport costs : The current high transport costs in some key corridors will be reduced by the road
rehabilitation program. In addition, the use of ICB procedures under Loan 3002-GU has helped to reduce construction costs
on the main roads. For rural roads, the proposed procedures, technologies, and selection criteria will be used to promote cost
savings.
(iv) Improving maintenance management and funding: The further decentralization of DGC, the expansion of contract
maintenance and the implementation of the road fund would continue to improve efficiency in the sector. However, while the
road fund is a more reliable source of funding, a significant amount of work remains to be done to establish procedures for
promoting least cost maintenance works and for long term sustainability of the fund itself.
(v) Improving accessibility: The pilot project will support improved road access in the ZONAPAZ Region.

8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
(i) Smaller main and secondary road rehabilitation/improvement component. This was rejected as (i) rehabilitation of main
corridors (CAI - Interamerican Highway) is urgently required to prevent further deterioration and higher subsequent
reconstruction costs; and (ii) MCTOPV's expenditure priority analysis, which was based on the recommendations of the
Plan Maestro Nacional de Transporte (PMNT) and the economic studies (including Bank's HDM-II model) of the
subprojects to be financed under the loan, indicate the very substantial returns to investments m the type of rehabilitation and
improvement works proposed.
(ii) Lareer rural roads component. This was rejected in view of the fact that a strategy needs to be developed for rural roads
and transport. Although decentralization of responsibilities for administering and maintaining such roads makes sense, given
the limited experience to date in Guatemala, it was decided instead to implement a pilot component in one of the departments
in ZONAPAZ to inter alia develop such a strategy and to test imnovative approaches for the administration and maintenance
of rural roads. The rural road investments to be carried out in the context of the pilot project will be selected from amongst
a large number of alternatives based on various economic and social criteria.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Bankwide experience with rural roads development and maintenance has shown that the principal problems in achieving
sustainable results have been: (i) institutional weaknesses, especially at sub-national levels of govermment; (ii) inadequate
funding coupled with unreliable and untimely budgetary releases; (in) excessive delays in the execution of works; (iv) lack
of a firm national framework or strategy for rural roads, resulting in dispersed efforts, piecemeal interventions and
insufficient attention to institutional and financial refonn; (v) low priority accorded to road maintenance needs; and (vi)
inadequate monitoring and evaluation of results. These lessons have been taken into account in the design of the rural roads
component of this project. Sub-national government capacity would be developed and strengthened under the pilot project
with the participation of INFOM, and arrangements put in place to involve the private sector in areas where local
goverunent capacity is constrained. Cost-sharing arrangements for funding rural roads would be identified to increase
funding for maintenance. Project implementation in general is expected to improve since DGC has acquired experience
under the ongoing roads loan (3002-U) with the use of Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs). Sector coordination would
be improved through the development of the national rural roads and transport strategy with the participation of INFOM and
the DGC. The need and importance of road maintenance would be emphasized through the implementation of the Pilot
Project and arrangements would be put in place to carry out maintenance activities on a sustainable basis. Finally,
systematic monitoring and evaluation procedures have been included in the project.
Bank experience in Guatemala with roads projects has shown that the principal problems have been related to: (i) long
effectiveness delays; (ii) frequent changes of project coordinators; and (iii) procurement. These lessons have been taken into
account in the design of this project. The project includes a minimum number of conditions for effectiveness which were
agreed during negotiations; the integration of the project coordination unit under the Planning Division of DGC ensures

Country Guatemala          Project itle: Rural and Main Roads Project
continuity in the project coordination activities even if personnel changes occur; and, as mentioned earlier, the experience of
DGC with Bank SBDs will minimize procurement related problems during project implementation.
1 1. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Rural road development constitutes a major part of the Government's strategy for raising the living standards of the rural
poor to comply with the targets contained in the Peace Accords signed in December 1996, which call for expenditures in
rural infiastructure, including roads, in the amount of US$50 million annually over the period 1997-2000.
The Borrower has prepared a comprehensive road investment program for the period 1997-2000, which includes the
rehabilitation of roads that will be financed under the proposed project, as well as others that are, or will be, financed by
other agencies (IDB, CABEI) or by the Govermnent. Since the time of the first CPPR meeting held with the current
Government in March 1996, it expressed its commitment to include infrastructure investments in the ZONAPAZ Region. To
carry out this program, the Government has increased its funding for road improvement. The Bank has also received strong
expressions of support from mnayors and other local government authorities in San Marcos, as well as from highly respected
representatives of the local indigenous communities who have confirmed the importance of the project to them and their
desire that implementation start as soon as possible.
12. Value added of Bank support:
(i) The Bank has supported the development of the Guatemalan road sector for a number of years and has maintained an
important policy dialogue on the development and maintenance of the sector. Given the new challenges facing the
Government in creating capacity to administer and maintain its rural roads, the Bank is well placed to assist these efforts,
because of its considerable worldwide experience in this area.
(ii) The Bank was instrumental in focusing DGC's attention on the advantages of contracting out maintenance and of
increasing maintenance funding on a sustainable basis. Bank experience with the design and implementation of road funds
will be useful in strengthening the maintenance funding arrangements now in place in Guatemala.
(iii) Among the various donors supporting the peace process in Guatemala, the Bank will be especially active in the
Department of San Marcos (other donors are taking the lead elsewhere in the ZONAPAZ). The Bank's various activities in
San Marcos should provide a good basis for understanding the specific development issues and political economy of that
area, and for offering effective implementation support.
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the project file. See Annex 8)
13. Economic Assessment (see Annex 4 for statistical tables):
Rural Roads: The rural roads component will address the rehabilitation and maintenance requirements of three classes of
roads in rural areas: (i) national roads; (ii) departmental roads; and (iii) municipal and community roads. The first class of
roads was subjected to standard cost-benefit analysis. Under the project, multi-criteria analysis will be applied for selection
and justification of interventions on road classes (ii) and (iii) coupled with a strong element of consultation and local
decision-making, as well as cost-sharing arrangements.
Main and Secondary Roads: All the proposed works on the main and secondary systems were selected from the PMNT's
recommendations and subjected to a cost-benefit analysis, using the Bank's BDM-HI model, that is summarized in Annex
4. All of the proposed rehabilitation works have satisfactory rates of return. The ERRs range from 24.4% to 51.8% with
an overall weighted average rate of return of 29.3% as summarized below:

Total:       261           29.3
Main assumptions:
Traffic Growth: 5% p.a., consistent with present trends on the main and secondary networks but which may prove
conservative, given the volume of traffic that could be generated from the road improvements.
Vehicle Operating Costs (VOC): VOC with and without the road improvements are derived using the deterioration profiles
from the HDM-l model, as calibrated for Guatemala.
Maintenance: Adequate penodic and routine maintenance expenditures are included in the ERR calculations. Maintenance
activities will be funded through the Road Fund.
Economic Prices: All prices exclude taxes and duties. Given the degree of trade openness of the economy, no shadow prices
or exchange rate adjustment factors have been used.
Risk and Sensitivity Analysis: Standard Sensitivity test results show that the economic returns are robust, with the IRR
remaining in the acceptable range.
Distributional impacts: Predominantly poor agncultural communities would be among the principal beneficiaries of the
rural road improvements. Most studies indicate that the income levels of these communities are typically well below
national averages. Furthermore, some of the indigenous areas to be served can be classified as being extremely poor as
described in the Bank's Poverty Report (Rep. No. 12313-GU) of April 17, 1995. For the main roads, the country as a
whole would benefit from the reduced vehicle operating costs and consumption of imported spare parts. The reduced costs
would also help to make Guatemala's exports more competitive, especially for low profit margin crops such as coffee and
bananas, and would benefit both the urban and rural areas.
Fiscal impacts: The project's annual investment and recurrent costs represent very small shares of Government investments
(< 0.5%/o); and of revenues from the transport sector. Similarly, future maintenance needs should not represent a fiscal
burden because this activity will be funded from the Road Maintenance Fund.
14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5):
Financing plan: The project's financing plan is shown on the cover sheet. The proposed loan of US$66.7 million would
cover 49% of project cost; OECF cofinancing would provide 36%, and the Govermnent would fund the balance.
Financial mana=ement and controls: The capacity exists at both INFOM and DGC for the preparation of adequate project
accounts and financial reports. These will be audited by an independent auditor and sent to the Bank by May 31 each year.
Project cost: (details in Annex 3). Road rehabilitation represents the largest share of costs, and is based on detailed and
preliminary designs for main roads and indicative cost estimates for rural roads. Technical assistance amounts to about
12% of project costs. The Government of Guatemala has agreed at negotiations to provide timely counterpart funds for
project implementation. Agreement has also been reached on maintenance funding arrangements for the rehabilitated roads.
15. Technical Assessment:
Road construction, improvement and rehabilitation works on the main and secondary road networks are not technically
complex. The technical criteria agreed with MCTOPV for similar works under the ongoing Bank Loan 3002-GU will be
used for the execution of these subprojects. For the rural roads component, design and work execution standards are under
preparation and will be included in the Operations Manual. Procedures are also in place for the efficient selection of
contractors and consultants to implement the works. The use of the Standard Bidding Documents should help to minimize
delays in procurement.
16. Institutional Assessment:
INFOM has undergone profound restructuring over the last 18 months, to strengthen its role as facilitator of local



Ptoject Appraisal Document                                                                        Page 10
Country: Guatemala          Project Title: Rural and Main Roads Project
government initiatives. INFOM is a self supporting agency, with experienc as a financial intermediary and executor of
multilateral agency-financed projects. Its principal functions within the project would be to assume a lead role in the
development of the national rural roads and transport strategy and serve as a conduit of funds and overall coordinator of the
municipal and community roads sub-component of the pilot project. INFOM is the lead agency in the water sector and has
extensive experience with the management of external funds. Its main strength lies in its well developed financial
management system and in the commitment of its management to reform. Its weaknesses include the potential remnants of
an inefficient civil service bureaucracy and a top-down approach to institutional development. Technical assistance would
be provided to INFOM at headquarters to strengthen the capacity of its recently established unit for external assistance.
The technical assistance will also strengthen the INFOM regional office in San Marcos to adequately develop its municipal
capacity building program as well as its ability to support and supervise the association and its private sector technical unit.
MCTOPV's capacity to rehabilitate the country's main and secondary road system has been steadily improving. The PCU
responsible for coordinating project implementation has been strengthened and procurement procedures have improved. The
PCU will be further strengthened by the provision of consultant services under the project to assist with project
implementation. On the other hand, MCTOPV's capacity to implement rural road projects through the zonas viales needs to
be improved and support would be provided under the project to achieve that. In addition, MCTOPV's capacity for policy
formulation needs to be strengthened, and TA would be provided for this. These technical assistance requirements have been
identified and the termns of reference for the appropriate technical assistance and studies are in the project file. The
institutional capacity of the municipalities under the pilot project was found to be weak. Therefore, TA and training would
be provided as an integral part of the pilot project to build up the capacity to assume the responsibilities of administering the
rural road network that would be entrusted to them.
17. Social Assessment:
The Government has placed high priority on the improvement of rural infrastructure as a means for meeting the challenges
of the Peace Accords. The Department of San Marcos, located in the western part of the ZONAPAZ Region, is one of the
poorest and most remote departments of Guatemala, and has been selected by the Bank for several interventions and
extensive analyses, including a social assessment, and demographic maps of much of the Department have been prepared.
These studies form the basis for the justification of the proposed Reconstruction and Community Development Project.
The Rural and Main Roads Project will complement investments and improvements planned in ongoing and proposed
projects in San Marcos. The project will improve road access to the ZONAPAZ Region, enhancing the integration
possibilities of the residents of that region to the country bringing with it improved social stability, in addition to promoting
economic development. As part of project preparation, numerous meetings were held with the affected population,
particularly those benefiting from the Pilot component, to inform and obtain feedback on the proposed project.
Inplementation will also include a heavily participatory approach; details of consultations and participation to date, and as
envisaged during implementation and operation, are provided in Section 19 below.
18. Environmental Assessment:     Environmental      []  A      [x ] B      [   C
Category
In the case of the rural roads component, the proposed works will generally remain on existing road alignments and
therefore, the risks of additional negative impacts linked with human activities (i.e., motorization, deforestation, etc.) are
minimal. In the case of any extensive paving or widening, environmental screening will be carried out and appropriate
environmental guidelines will be part of all bidding documents and contracts. Supervision of the compliance with the
guidelines will be included in the terms of reference of the consulting firm responsible for the supervision of the works.
The project will also assist DGC and the municipalities in developing and implementing sound strategies for environmental
management of road projects, particularly rural roads. The strategy will include guidelines on: (i) procedures for
environmental screening of projects at the identification stage; (ii) identification of environmental damages and design of
corrective or mitigating measures; and (iii) technical specifications for work execution, with clear provisions to ensure that

work methods are environmentally sound.
The main and secondary road subprojects involve largely road rehabilitation and improvements within existing rights-of way
and are expected to produce minimal environmental impacts and no resettlement actions. Assessed environmental mitigation
actions required have been included in the project costs. Although no resettlement actions are envisaged as a result of
project implementation, the Government, in keeping with Bank procedures, has developed a resettement policy to provide
appropriate compensation to families or individuals who may be affected by any of the subprojects financed under the pilot
Departmental and Municipal Rural Roads subprojects. Finally, for cultural artifacts, while the probability of discovery is
very low, the SBDs for works would contain appropriate provisions to ensure that contractors comply with Government and
Bank procedures when and if needed.

Consultation strategies being developed as part of the pilot component include early involvement of beneficiaries as part of
the subproject selection criteria. Informed participation of indigenous peoples will be ensured and consultation with
indigenous leaders has already been carried out. In line with the agreements reached in March, 1997 by the Government
and the Bank regarding the Operational Directive on Indigenous Peoples, the project preparation team held meetings with
the Governor and mayors of the Department of San Marcos and the Consejos de Desarrollo to discuss the proposed
components to be financed under the project in that Department. So far, four meetings have been held on: (i) April 24, 1997
with the participation of MCTOPV, the Govemor of San Marcos, the Consejo Regional and the Bank; (ii) April 30, 1997
with the participation of the Governor of San Marcos, SEGEPLAN, the histituto de Fomento Municipal (INFOM), 11
mayors and PHRD-funded consultants who worked on project preparation; (iii) May 9, 1997 with the participation of
mayors and the PHRD-funded consultants; and iv) July 9, 1997 with the association in Tejutla. Prior to the last
consultation, road inventories and surveys had been carried out to determine inter alia the size of the road network and the
needs of the municipalities being considered for the pilot component. A two-day workshop was held in November 1997
with the association, community representatives, and other stakeholders to work out details of the institutional and financial
arrangements of the pilot municipal road component and the selection criteria to be implemented for choosing the municipal
roads to be included under the pilot project. Additional community based workshops and consultations will be carried out in
accordance with the parameters of the agreements mentioned herein.
20. Sustainability:
Implementation of this project would lead to the use of public resources for economically efficient purposes. It would also
encourage the use of more appropriate road rehabilitation and maintenance technologies, and improve the quality of road
works. Project implementation would, therefore, lead to designing and putting into practice better road maintenance and
management techniques for all road link classifications. In the case of rural roads, the sustainability issue would be
addressed as part of the implementation of the Pilot component which will ensure capacity at the local level and explore
alternative cost-sharing mechanisms for municipal rural roads in a sustainable way. The pilot project has been designed to:
(i) cover a specific geographical area to facilitate its design and supervision; (ii) include financing for technical assistance
and training to local governments, contractors and community groups so that their capacity to carry out road improvement
and maintenance activities can be enhanced; (iii) include financing for the strengthening of the local institutional
arrangements; and (iv) foster local ownership by including inter alia the input of local communities in the criteria to be
adopted for the selection of the rural roads to be incorporated in the pilot project. Taken together, this is a sustainable
package as over time it would ensure that investments are properly maintained.

Annex 2
Guatemala Rural and Main Roads Project
Detailed Project Description
PART A - RURAL ROADS
A.1 - National Rural Roads and Transport Strategv - US$ 0.5 million
The rural roads sub-sector has been characterized by multiple actors and a lack of standards and sustainable maintenance
arrangements. Each actor has its own investment criteria and applies different rules for the same type of roads. Inventories
in the Department of San Marcos indicate that there may be three times as many rural roads in Guatemala than are
currently classified under DGC responsibility. There is no coherent set-up for maintenance of rural roads--rural roads are
built and rehabilitated, but are not maintained. This waste of resources poses a huge cost to the country, which is
disproportionately born by the poorest and weakest segments of society. This component would finance the support to
development of a national rural roads and transport strategy. The current national transport masterplan is sound as far as it
goes, but it refers only in passing to rural roads and transport. The national Municipal Development Institute (INFOM),
with support from MCTOPV/DGC, will assume the lead role in developing the strategy using a participatory process,
involving stakeholder representatives in working groups and workshops (e.g., the national association of municipalities, and
representatives of transport service providers, farmers group, the various funds, NGOs and donors). The strategy
development process will draw on past and current experiences in the rural roads sub-sector and directly build on and feed
into the pilot municipal rural roads component of the project. Technical assistance would be provided to INFOM and funds
made available for studies and workshops.
A. 2 - Rural Roads Pilot Comronent- US$ 29.7 million
The pilot will be located in the Department of San Marcos, which is in the far western part of the ZONAPAZ Region.
Project interventions focus on the area encompassing twelve municipalities in the Altiplano Marquense. The Altiplano is
one of the poorest areas of Guatemala, and it was seriously affected during the years of civil conflict. Targets contained in
the recently signed Peace Accords, call for expenditures in rural infrastructure, including roads, in the amount of US$50
million annually over the period 1997-2000. The proposed project would help to ensure that these planned expenditures, at
least in so far as rural roads are concemed, actually materialize. The area has reasonably high agricultural potential for the
production of wheat, maize, potatoes, broccoli and temperate fruits.
The overall objective of the pilot component is to improve access by rural people to economic and social services. The pilot
will design, try out and gradually implement institutional arrangements for sustainable maintenance of the various levels of
the rural road network in San Marcos. The institutional arrangements will involve DGC, the INFOM, municipalities,
communities and the private sector. DGC is, and will continue to be, responsible for the national and departmental roads
(220 km in The Altiplano). The municipalities in San Marcos, together with individual communities, will assume gradually
the responsibility for the remaining 1,100 km of the network.
The pilot has three distinct sub-components:
(i)   rehabilitation of the national and departmental routes in the Altiplano Marquense;
(ii)   testing of new technologies for cost-effective strengthening of the surface of rural roads;
(iii)   piloting of a new institutional framework for management and financing of municipal rural roads. This
includes the support to the development of local contractors for the execution of works, and to the private
consulting industry for management of municipal roads.



Sub-components (i) and (ii) will be the direct responsibility of DGC, while INFOM will be the national level agency
charged with sub-component (iii) with the participation of the Association of Municipalities.
Sub-Component (i): Rehabilitation of National and Departmental Routes in the Altiplano Marquense
The Altiplano has one national route (RN12) which runs from the departmental capital in the east (San Marcos) towards the
northern part of the Department of San Marcos (Tacana), the Mexican border and the southern part of the Department of
Huehuetenango (Tectitan). This 91 km road, including the branch off to Tejutla, will be fully rehabilitated. It carries an
average daily traffic (ADT) ranging from 350 vehicles near San Marcos, 250 at Tejutla and about 100 near Tacana. The
population served by the road is estimated at 350,000 inhabitants most of whom are poor or very poor. The rehabilitation
and improvement of the road will reduce travel time (it now takes 7 hours by bus during the dry season to go from San
Marcos to Tectitan) and ensure adequate all-weather access to the area. Additional road links will be identified from the
160 km of departmental roads during the first and second year of the project. Most of these roads are in fair to poor
condition. In order for the municipalities to be able to focus on their legislated responsibility, which is the municipal roads
network, the departmental network into which many of the municipal roads feed, must be in passable condition. About 50
km of the departmental roads will be improved using new technologies (see component ii below). The remaining 110 km of
departmental roads will be rehabilitated to gravel standard. The project will also finance consultant services for the
preparation of final engineering designs of priority subprojects, to be identified during the first year of project
implementation, and for the supervision of the works to be financed under this component.
Sub-Component (ii): New Technologies for Cost-effective Strengthening of Rural Roads
In the Altiplano, annual precipitation is very high. The rainfall causes great stress to all roads, but particularly to the earth
and gravel roads in the hilly areas. DGC and the municipalities believe that surfacing of rural roads with low cost materials
could be more cost-efficient than gravelling which is the current method of rural road construction. The pilot will
experiment with the use of two to three technologies on 50 km of departmental roads at the cost of about US$ 50,000 to
$75,000 per km. The performance, strength, maintenance requiremeits and costs of these technologies (materials) will be
closely monitored over time and will assist the Guatemalan road agencies to determine optimal technology choice in similar
areas.
Sub-Component (iii): Institutional Framework for Municipal and Community Roads
'he centerpiece of the pilot project is the creation of sustainable arrangements for management and financing of local roads
in rural areas. This sub-component will introduce an innovative institutional framework for maintaining municipal rural
roads in the Altiplano of the Department of San Marcos, consistent with the govermment's policy of decentralization of local
service provision to municipalities.
There are twelve municipalities in the Altiplano Marquense, and the average municipal rural road network is 90 km
(between 25 km and 200 km). These networks are too small to justify the build-up of technical capacity in each
municipality to manage roads. The municipalities therefore have grouped together in order to achieve scale and be able to
cost-efficiently provide road infrastructure. In the first half of 1997, the twelve municipalities of the Altiplano agreed to
form an association (the association) to pursue development of the area by seeking solutions to issues of common interest,
such as roads. The association is in the final stages of obtaining its legal status. During a consultative event, the mayors of
the twelve municipalities decided that this association will constitute the core entity for the management of municipal road
network. This decision was subsequently confirmed by another consultation on July 3, 1997.
The planning, programming and management of municipal roads in the twelve municipalities will be contracted out to the
private sector through the municipalities' association. The institutional framework for the management of the municipal
roads is depicted in Figure 1 (attached). The twelve municipalities which constitute the association will form an assembly
of representatives of each municipality (e.g., mayor or councilor) and of some of the communities. The assembly will
appoint an executive board with representatives from both groups. The Board will recommend cost-sharing arrangements
to the assembly, seek and manage funds. The Board will be headed by an Executive Director, appointed by the Assembly.



The Board will contract a private sector finn/unit to provide technical services to the association, and UMAV (Unidad
Marquense de Asistencia Vial). UMAV will be responsible to the Board and will be paid directly by the association, i.e., by
the twelve municipalities. UMAV will provide technical advise to the municipalities and assist them in the drawing up
multi-annual maintenance and investment programs. It will also prepare, let and manage road contracts on behalf of the
member municipalities and their communities.
INFOM, which is the national level agency in charge of municipal development and training, will serve as advisor to the
Board. DGC, which is the central sector agency for roads, will also be an advisor to the Board, represented through the
chief engineer of the Zona Vial as well as a staff from the departmental technical unit (UTD). These advisors will facilitate
the coordination with the Departmental Development Council (el Consejo de Desarrollo Departamental).
UMAV will be constituted by a Guatemalan consulting firm. It is foreseen that replication of this set-up in other
departments will create a market for private sector finns in provision of services for the management of municipal roads.
During the pilot phase, UMAV will be temporarily strengthened to allow for the setting up of systems and training of local
contractors in the rehabilitation and maintenance of municipal roads. Short-term technmcal assistance will also be provided
to lend specialist support to the Board.
INFOM will be the national level agency responsible for the implementation of the component with the participation of the
Association of Municipalities. The pilot project will provide an opportunity to further assess the suitability of INFOM as a
national coordination unit for municipal rural roads. INFOM will assist the municipalities and the association by
performing four important functions:
i. channeling of funds: Bank funds will be transferred to INFOM through a special account to be maintained in
the Central Bank. It will transfer these funds to the road fund account of the association. The Board, with the
assistance of the local INFOM office in San Marcos and UMAV, will periodically report to the office in charge of
external financing at INFOM;
ii. technical assistance: INFOM will provide technical assistance and training to the association in accounting
and assist the association in the supervision and monitoring of the UMAV. The DGC coordination unit will assist
INFOM and the association in the recruitment of a private sector firm to the UMAV;
iii. training: INFOM has long experience in the training of local governments and communities and will work
closely with the twelve municipalities to enhance their capacity to generate local resources, to plan and to
effectively manage their resources. INFOM will also work closely with the association to strengthen the
management capacity of its Board; and
iv. overall component management. INFOM will be the national level agency liaising with the association through
its coordinating unit Unidad Marquense de Asistencia Vial (UMAV). As such, INFOM will among other things
periodically provide technical and financial reports to the Bank.
In order to perform the above mentioned functions effectively, INFOM will be strengthened at both the national and local
level. At the national level, a consultant will be recruited to assist INFOM to strengthen its external finance unit. The
consultant will play a key role in the setting up of a cost-accounting system for the association and in the production of
financial and technical reports to the Bank. At the local level, INFOM will strengthen its office in San Marcos by recruiting
an engineer, and a social worker/trainer. The engineer will monitor the performance of UMAV and liaise with UTD and the
municipalities. The trainer (social worker) will work closely with the individual municipalities and communities to ensure
that there is full understanding of the institutional rules and cost-sharing arrangements and support the municipalities in
their efforts to widen their local resource base.



PART B - MAIN AND SECONDARY ROADS
B.1 - Road Rehabilitation on the Main and Secondary Road Networks -US$ 75.4 million
This component will finance the rehabilitation and improvement of approximately 370 km of main, secondary and tertiary
roads. The component will also finance consulting services for engineering designs, works supervision, technical assistance
and studies and a limited amount of equipment (vehicles and computers for DGC).
The roads to be financed under this component are:
(i) CAlW (Inter-American Highway) Section: Cuatro Caminos-La MesiDa (Mexican Border) (154 km; US$ 25.OM -
IBRD financing). This is a two lane section of the Inter-American Highway which crosses the country and connects it to
Mexico in the north and El Salvador and Honduras in the south. The road passes through the departments of
Huehuetenango and Totonicapan, which are part of the ZONAPAZ region. The average daily traffic (ADT) averages 2200
vehicles in the section Cuatro Caminos-Huehuetenango (75 km) and 1800 vehicle in the section Huehuetenango-La Mesilla
(78 km). Approximately 36% of the vehicles are trucks and buses. The road has a substandard cross section for this type of
road (3.0 Mts. lane widths) and some of the sections are in poor condition. An intervention on the entire road length is
required at this time to prevent further deterioration and higher subsequent reconstruction costs. The proposed works consist
of the widening of the traffic lanes (from 3.0 Mts. to 3.6 Mts.), the reinforcement of the pavement structure, the
improvement of shoulders and drainage and the provision of adequate road signs. Because the road will be maintained
within the existing right-of-way, no land acquisition or resettlement actions will be necessary.
(ii) CAIW (Inter-American Highway) Section: Chimaltenango-Tecpan (36 Ian; US$ 11.4M OECF financing). This is
a two-lane section of the Inter-American Highway connecting Guatemala to Mexico, El Salvador and Honduras. ADT
averages 7,000 vehicles (35% trucks and buses). The road is in poor condition and has a substandard cross-section for this
type of road (3.0 Mts. lane widths). The proposed works consist of the widening of the traffic lanes to 3.6 Mts. and the full
rehabilitation of the entire section. No significant changes to the horizontal and vertical aligmnents are proposed and,
therefore, no land acquisition or resettlement actions will be necessary. A proposal exists to add climbing lanes at locations
where the existing right-of-way allows.
(iii) CAlE (Interamerican Highway) Section: Don Justo-Branch Off to Santa Elena BariDas (8.0 kIn; US3.OM IBRD
financing). This is a two-lane section of the Inter-American Highway near Guatemala City and serving international traffic
between Guatemala and El Salvador and Honduras and commuters who reside in Santa Elena Barillas and other
neighboring localities and work in Guatemala City. ADT on this section is approximately 8000 vehicles (30% trucks and
buses). The proposed works consist in the widening of the road to four lanes within the existing right-of-way. No
expropriation or resettlement actions are required.
(iv) RN7W Section: San Cristobal Verapaz-Sacapulas-Chiantlas (162 kun; US$34.6M; OECF financing). This two-
lane earth road located in the heart of the ZONAPAZ Region crosses in an east-west direction the departments of Alta
Verapaz, Quiche and Huehuetenango. The rehabilitation and improvement of this project is essential to improve its year
round passability and to integrate the area served by the road with the rest of the country. The proposed subproject
complements the road rehabilitation works to be financed by IDB for the north-south roads connecting the RN7W to the rest
of the road network. The existing road will be rehabilitated and some bridges reconstructed. In order to keep the costs low,
the proposed design will maintain much of its current geometric standards including cross sections, the horizontal and
vertical alignments.
(v) CA-9S - San Vicente Pacaya (8.0 kIn; US$1.5 M; IBRID financing). This earth road provides access to the town of
San Vicente de Pacaya (population 10,000) located some 30 kmn to the south of Guatemala City and to the Pacaya Volcano
located 5 km past the town. The town is a dormitory for people working in Guatemala City. The area surrounding the
town is agricultural with coffee, flowers and vegetables being the main products. The existing road is in poor condition
and its passability becomes a problem during the rainy season. The ADT on the road reaches 300 vehicles. The proposed
works include the rehabilitation and upgrading of the road (surface treatrnent/paving).



B.2 - Consultant Services for Suvervision of Works, Studies and Technical Assistance
The component will also finance consultant services for: (i) the supervision of the works; (ii) the preparation of final
engineering and other studies; and (iii) technical assistance. Terms of Reference for the TA to be financed are in the project
file.
B.3 - EquiDment
This component will finance a limited amount of equipment (vehicles, computers) to support the normal activity of DGC.

Annex 4
Guatemala Rural and Main Roads Project
Summary Economic Analysis
Background
1.    The roads scheduled for improvement are located primarily in Guatemala's zones of extreme poverty, including the
departments of Huehuetenango, Quiche, Totonicapan, San Marcos, and Alta and Baja Verapaz. These departments
contain about 30% of the country's land area and about 33% of its population. Completion of the project will lead to the
improvement of about 260 km of main roads. The proposed improvements are for road links located strategically on main
trade corridors, namely the Pan American Highway link between Mexico and Guatemala City, or in areas of considerable
agricultural and tourism development potential, such as San Marcos or Huehuetenango.
2.    Agriculture and related activities are the principal contributors to the economy in these departments. However, it is
difficult and costly to move regional products, especially fruits and vegetables, to ports and export markets because the road
network is both limited in coverage and extremely poor in condition. This helps to depress farmgate prices and also makes
it difficult to provide social and other essential services to the predominantly poor population in these departments. In San
Marcos for example, the consultants have estimated that there is about 100% difference in farmgate and market prices for
some of the commodities produced in the Department. There may be other factors but the poor road conditions have
certainly contributed to high agricultural production losses, and high transport costs, especially in the wet season, and low
overall profitability of agriculture.
3.    This situation led the Government to formulate a master plan (PM) to improve the road network to such an extent
that it could support rather than hinder economic activity and therefore help Guatemala compete internationally with its
NAFTA and Central American neighbors. The main and secondary roads to be improved under this project were selected
primarily from the master plan and subsequently detailed feasibility studies were carried out (using the HDM3) to verify
the economic justification. Copies of the feasibility studies are in the Project Files and a detailed extract on the salient
features of the analysis are shown in table 4.1 of this annex. Due to its continuity with the rural roads improvements, the
main assumptions and methodology for the analysis for route 12 is summarized here. Similar principles were followed for
the other main and secondary road links This led to an overall 29.3% economic rate of return estimate for the project's road
rehabilitation component.
Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.    The investments, maintenance, and institutional strengthening arrangements supported by the project will provide a
wide range of benefits. These include (i) long term improvements in the management of the road network due partly to an
increased awareness of the role of maintenance; (ii) improved access for residents of the marginalized Departments to
health, education, and other services; (iii) improved access to markets and services for agricultural producers; and (iv)
significant reduction in transportation costs. The benefits from the road improvements can be quantified as they consist
largely of savings in voc accruing to road users. The voc were derived from recent DGC information on operating costs for
typical vehicles on roads in both good and poor conditions in Guatemala, after adjusting for taxes and duties. The voc
savings vary by vehicle type from 39% (for pickups) to 70% (for large trucks), which is not unusual given that the road will
be improved considerably under the project. Another quantifiable benefit that will accrue would be the savings in travel
time as the improved road surface will allow higher operating speeds. This is particularly true in the rainy season as
currently the road is often impassable due to vehicles being stuck on the road.
Traffic
5.    The traffic on route 12 varies primarily according to distances from the most important marketing centers (San
Marcos, San Pedro, Tacani) that influence it. The volume of vehicles per day (vpd) was determined by counts carried out
periodically by the DGC and updated on the basis of 4-day counts carried out by the consultants in May and July 1997. At



the same time a limited origin-destination study was carried out which showed that most trips were work or business
related. The traffic ranged by road section from 90 to 377 vpd and it consisted generally of 56% pickups and light
vehicles, 40% trucks, and about 4% buses. Traffic growth rates have been modest (about 3% pa) during the last 5 years;
for the future they have been set at 4-6% pa. This is more in keeping with the expected growth of GDP and the increasing
economic activities that are likely to follow the road improvement.
Economic Returns.
6.    The internal rate of return for route 12 was estimated at 29.9%. As discussed above, this return is based primarily
on the quantifiable, vehicle related costs and benefit streams associated with the road improvement. There are other non-
quantified benefits as, for example, the improved roads will help improve road safety by eliminating the hazardous
conditions caused by large potholes, other road surface irregularities, and the lack of adequate shoulders and bus bays. The
improvement works will also create employment for about 300 workers over a 24 month period. A summary statistical
abstract of the ERR and NPV determination and the sensitivity analysis is included as table 4.1, but the following is a brief
overview for all of the links.

Totals                           261        29.3
Distributional Impact.
7.    The principal beneficiaries of the rural roads improvements will be the predominantly poor agricultural
communities. Most studies indicate that the income levels of these communities are typically well below national averages.
Furthermore, most of the indigenous areas to be served can be classified as being extremely poor. For the main roads, the
country as a whole will benefit from the reduced vehicle operating costs and consumption of imported spare parts. The
reduced transportation costs will also help to make Guatemala's exports more competitive, especially for low profit margin
crops such as coffee and bananas and will benefit both the urban and rural areas.
Fiscal Impacts.
8.    These will be overwhelmingly positive. The project's annual investment needs are small and represent very small
shares of both Government expenditures (< 0.5%) and of revenues from the license fees, fuel taxes, etc. recovered from the
transport sector (<1.0%). Similarly, the future maintenance needs will not represent a fiscal burden. This is because
Guatemala has imposed an additional surcharge on fuels which is deposited directly into the Road Maintenance Fund
(Fondo Vial) that is managed by MCTOPV. This is an adequate source of funds for the maintenance needs of the roads to
be rehabilitated under the project.

Guatemala Rural and Main Roads Project
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement of works and goods will follow the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD and IDA
Credits, dated January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996. Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs) will
be used for all Bank financed procurement. Procurement of consultant services will follow the "Guidelines for the
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers", dated January 1997. The procurement
arrangements below were derived from the procurement plan which is in the project files.
The Pilot Project to be executed in the Department of San Marcos, would cover 12 municipalities. Two executing
agencies (INFOM, the association and DGC) will be responsible for procuring the works and services contracts for:
municipal roads; community roads; and departmental roads.
Table A shows the project costs and procurement arrangements. International competitive bidding (ICB)
procedures will be used for work contracts of US $1.0 million or more, to be financed under Rural Roads-Pilot
Project and the Main and Secondary Roads components. For work contracts estimated to cost US $100,000 but
less than US $1 million, national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures will be used. Work contracts less than
$100,000 will be awarded on the basis of proposals obtained from at least three qualified domestic contractors.
Formal prequaifications of contractors will be carried out for ICB contracts exceeding US $10 million. Small
maintenance contracts under the Pilot Project, estimated to cost less than US $30,000 up to an aggregate of US
$1.48 million, may be done through direct contracting with community organizations and microenterprises for road
maintenance following special procedures outlined in paragraph 3.15 of the Guidelines and on the basis of reference
unit prices and standardized quantities; and three quotations in the case of local contractors. This procurement
modality would allow for (i) the participation of poor local communities in the direct management of small works;
(ii) the formation of maintenance microenterprises; and (iii) the development of local contractors. Vehicles and
office equipment to be procured under the project with a cost per contract of US $150,000 or more will be procured
using ICB; individual contracts costing between US $25,000 and US $150,000 will be procured under NCB rules;
and for individual contracts below US $25,000 national and international shopping procedures will be used based
on three quotations.
Preference for domestically manufactured goods. The provisions of paragraphs 2.54 and 2.55 of the Guidelines and
Appendix thereto shall apply to goods manufactured in the territory of the Borrower.
Table B summarizes the prior review thresholds. In the case of works and goods, all ICB and NCB contracts will
be subject to prior review. For 3 quotations of contractors of works, the first two contracts to be awarded in each
calendar year will be subjected to prior review. All ICB and NCB procured goods will be subjected to prior review.
The first contracts will be subjected to prior review in the case of goods to be procured under National and
International shopping methods. For consultant services, prior review will be needed for all contracts valued at
more than US$100,000 for firmsVnd all contracts with individuals costing more than US$50,000 equivalent. For
consultant contracts valued at less than the amounts indicated above, prior review by the Bank will only cover the
corresponding terms of reference and short lists.
Consultancies. All consulting services financed through this loan will be contracted in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines for the Use Consultants (January 1997). Consultants' services will be procured under contracts
awarded following three different types of selection methods for Consultancies under the required conditions: (i)



Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS); (ii) Quality Based Selection (QBS); and (iii) Selection Under a Fixed
Budget. The procurement plan provides information on the types of contracts under various categories.

Special Account. In order to facilitate disbursements, the Government will establish two Special Accounts (for
DGC and INFOM) in the Central Bank in Guatemala to be maintained in US Dollars. One of the accounts to be
managed by MCTOPV, through DGC for the implementation of the project components under DGC's
responsibility. The other will be managed by INFOM for the unplementation of the municipal road component of
the pilot project and the development of the national rural road strategy. The initial deposit for the DGC managed
Special Account will be US$ 3.5 million while the deposit for the INFOM managed special account will be US$
750,000. These amounts are consistent with the expected disbursements of the project. The amount of each
authorized allocation is the average of 4 months of expenditures that are expected to be paid from the account.



Replenishment of the accounts will be made monthly or when 20% of the authorized ceiling has been disbursed,
whichever is earlier.
Documentation. Disbursements from the loan for the following types of contracts require full documentation: (i) all
ICB and NCB civil work contracts; (ii) goods to be procured under ICB and NCB; (iii) consulting contracts with
firms valued at US$100,000 (or equivalent) or more; and consulting contracts with individuals valued at
US$50,000 (or equivalent) or more. All other disbursements will be made against statement of expenditures
(SOEs), for which full supporting documentation will be retained by MCTOPV, and made available to the Bank on
request and for audit by external auditors.
Retroactive Financing. Retroactive financing, about US$ 6.5 million which represent about 10% of the Bank
loan, will be provided for eligible expenditures incurred after project identification begins and within 12 months
before the expected date of loan signing. Eligible expenditures will consist of services which support the
objectives/components of the project, as stated in Block 1, sections 1 and 2, and Annex 2. Retroactive financing
must follow Bank procurement and consultant guidelines.
