MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
Subject:     Project Completion Report on Pakistan
Command Water Management Project (Credit 1487-PAK)
Attached is the PCR on the Pakistan Command Water Management Project (Credit 1487-
PAK) prepared by the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program for the South Asia Regional
Office. Part II was prepared by the Borrower. The report includes comments by the cofinancier
(USAID).
The project followed an irrigation systems rehabilitation and two on-farm water
management projects and aimed to increase agricultural production by improved water
management and agricultural services in parts of selected canal commands, to develop replicable
water management techniques, and to strengthen provincial agencies and farmer participation.
The project greatly exceeded civil works targets, as local costs in dollar terms were much
reduced by devaluation and savings were used on an expanded program. Institutional objectives
were neglected, however, such that reforms of water management systems were not achieved,
training was deficient, and a replicable model was not developed. Monitoring and evaluation was
of limited usefulness. Water user associations functioned only while renovation was underway,
but farmers are maintaining channels. Cost recovery objectives were being met in one of the four
provinces.
The satisfactory PCR highlights weak Bank performance on institutional aspects
(especially diagnosis of constraints), inadequate attention to the role of extension services, and
insufficiently participatory Bank supervision. In Part II, the Borrower queries the practicality of
introducing broad institutional change alongside investments in only small parts of canal
commands. The PCR identified substantial project benefits, in addition to output expansion
induced by market and price incentives, and reestimated a satisfactory economic rate of return.
Project performance is rated as marginally satisfactory, while institutional development is
rated as modest, and sustainability as likely.
An audit is planned.

COMMAND WATER MANAGEMENT PROJECT
(Credit 1487-PAK)
PREFACE
1.        This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Command Water Management
(CWM) Project for which Credit 1487-PAK in the amount of SDR 43.7 million was approved
on May 29, 1984. The project was cofinanced by the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) with a grant of US$25.0 million. Of this grant, only about US$22.9
million were disbursed because USAID withdrew from the project in early 1991. The credit
closing date was extended three times (by one year each time) to December 31, 1992, and the
credit account was kept open until April 30, 1993. The last disbursement was made on May 19,
1993, raising the disbursed total to SDR 42.69 million (97.7% of the credit). The unspent
balance of SDR 1.01 million was cancelled.
2.        The PCR, except Part II, was prepared by an FAO/World Bank Cooperative
Program mission" which visited Pakistan in February 1994, and reviewed by the Agricultural
Operations Division, Country Department III, South Asia Region. Preparation was based on the
Staff Appraisal Report (SAR); the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) and Project
Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence with the Borrower and internal IDA
memoranda; project evaluations sponsored by USAID; the draft PCR prepared for the Borrower
by local consultants; field visits; and discussions with Government of Pakistan (GOP) and
Provincial Government officials, staff of the implementing agencies and consultants involved in
project supervision and review, and IDA staff associated with the project. Part II was prepared
by the Borrower.
Messrs. S.A. Rehman (irrigation and drainage engineer/mission leader, consultant), J. Ernstberger
(agricultural economist, consultant), and M.A. Chaudhary (agronomist, consultant).

COMMAND WATER MANAGEMENT PROJECT
(Credit 1487-PAK)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
1.        The project's objective was to enhance returns through a comprehensive approach
to irrigated agriculture by providing complementary investments in the physical and institutional
aspects of water management in seven subproject areas located in all four provinces (510,000
acres).  To this end, the five-year project (FY85-89) was to develop replicable water
management techniques; build within the relevant provincial agencies a capability for planning,
implementing, operating and maintaining integrated, efficient programs of irrigated agriculture;
and strengthen farmer participation in water users associations (WUAs).
lmplementation Experience
2.        The IDA credit became effective on March 28, 1985, about six and a half months
later than originally planned due to delay in signature of the USAID cofinancing agreement.
The project also experienced a slow start because supervisory consultants were appointed some
eight months after credit effectiveness. Despite these delays, progress on irrigation civil works
was close to SAR targets by the original credit closing date of December 31, 1989. As more
funding became available due to the depreciation of the Rupee and US dollar against the SDR,
the closing date was extended three times by one year each time and additional works were
undertaken. Following the unforeseen withdrawal of USAID assistance, IDA agreed in April
1991 to also finance improvement of watercourses and associated consulting services. By the
final closing (December 31, 1992), civil works covered about 883,000 acres, or 173% of the
planned area.
3.        Agricultural development and water management demonstrations suffered from the
shorter than planned stay of the USAID-financed technical assistance team and from the lack of
practical applicability of some recommendations. Data from demonstration plots were collected
haphazardly and seldom subjected to rigorous analysis. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) was
initiated in 1989, carried out for about two years in a largely unsystematic manner, and produced
results of limited usefulness. Institutional integration received little attention and suffered as a
result.

Results
4.        The project reduced losses in canals and watercourses, increased water supply at
farm level, and raised agricultural production and incomes. Most of the agricultural productivity
increases were due to water savings and improved water distribution resulting from canal lining,
outlets remodelling and watercourse renovation. Adoption of improved agricultural production
techniques fell short of expectations. Nevertheless, the re-estimated economic rate of return
(ERR) of the project is 23 % and thus close to the SAR estimate of 24 %, despite project impact
on yields below SAR expectations. The re-estimated ERR benefits from two main variations to
SAR assumptions: (i) investment costs per unit of land have been lower; and (ii) economic
prices for some products are higher.
5.        The project failed to develop a model and capability of the relevant provincial
agencies for integrated planning and management of irrigated agriculture.  There was
improvement in the capacity of the agencies for planning and execution of civil works. On the
farmers' side, most of the WUAs were only active during the short period of rehabilitation of
their watercourses. The project essentially emphasized the potential and process of institution
building rather than focussing resources and activities on achieving integrated management of
irrigated agriculture.
Sustainability
6.        The physical sustainability of project civil works depends on efficient operation and
maintenance (O&M). There is a risk that funds allocated for O&M may not be sufficient as
water charges have been decreasing in real terms. On the other hand, despite most of the
WUAs being inactive, the PCR mission noted during field visits that maintenance of renovated
watercourses received adequate attention from farmers.
Lessons Learned
7.        Major lessons from project implementation relevant to IDA are: (i) while designing
projects for canal command area development, institutional constraints should be carefully
diagnosed, and resources and activities focused on achieving declared objectives; (ii) projects
financed by more than one donor should be governed by an internally consistent set of planning
documents; (iii) a project aimed at raising agricultural production must delineate a structured role
for agricultural extension services; and (iv) the multidisciplinary content of a command area
development project requires more proactive and participatory project supervision rather than
routine reporting of progress and issues.
8.        Lessons relevant to the Borrower are:  (i) integrated management of irrigated
agriculture needs a radical reorientation away from compartmentalized line agency thinking;
(ii) M&E operations must be instituted from the start of project implementation and need to be
well organized and systematic to develop a strong management information system and, as a



result, a continuously evolving coherent management strategy; (iii) expatriate technical assistance
must be closely integrated into the objectives and operations of the project; (iv) WUAs will
continue to be active if there are functions for which all members have sufficient interest (which
calls for the relevant agencies to go beyond blueprint construction); and (v) water scheduling
intervention promoted by expatriate experts must take into account that the Indus Canal System
is water scarce by design, and farmers tend to maximize income per unit of water by expanding
crop area rather than applying optimum amounts of water to crops.

2. Background
2.1       Pakistan's economy relies heavily on agriculture. Irrigated land produces about
90% of total farm output. Great efforts and resources have been invested in building the Indus
Irrigation System (IIS), which serves about 12 million ha (75% of total irrigated area). The total
length of IIS canals is about 36,000 miles with on-farm watercourses and ditches running another
one million miles. Various studies by the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA)
indicate that about 25 % of the diverted surface supplies are lost before reaching the farm outlet,
while irrigation efficiencies below the outlet average between 40% and 50%. Major crops,
which cover about 62 % of the annual sown area, are wheat, cotton, rice and sugarcane. Yields
have been less than half the estimated potential. Achievement of higher productivity requires
improved agricultural services and increased efficiency of the irrigation system, as well as
attention to producer incentives.
2.2        During the Fifth Five-Year Plan (FY79-83), GOP had formulated and begun to
implement a new policy for irrigated agriculture based on the recommendations of a UNDP-
financed study" published in May 1979. This policy emphasized the need to upgrade the
efficiency of existing facilities in irrigation. It also recommended institutional improvements,
and placed priority on drainage, rehabilitation, and water management projects. These policy
"Revised Action Programme for Irrigated Agriculture" (RAP) prepared by WAPDA with the Bank as
executing agency.



- 2 -
efforts were continued during the Sixth Five-Year Plan (FY84-88). The CWM Project was in
line with Plan objectives, and was to address directly the problem of under-utilized assets.
3. Project Objectives and Description
3.1        Project Objectives. The primary objective of the CWM approach was to increase
productivity of irrigated agriculture by exploring ways to bring about physical and institutional
improvements within canal command areas. To achieve this goal, the specific objectives of the
project were to: (a) increase agricultural production through improved water management,
coordinated with efficient supply of agricultural services and non-water inputs; (b) develop water
management techniques replicable in other parts of the country; (c) build within the relevant
provincial agencies a capability for planning, implementing, operating, and maintaining
integrated and efficient programs for irrigated agriculture; and (d) strengthen farmer participation
in WUAs to improve their management of water and other resources, and to enable them to have
a stronger voice in the decision making process.
3.2        Project Description. Special efforts were made to cover a wide range of physical
and agro-climatic conditions and socio-cultural variables. Seven subproject areas were chosen
in the four provinces: Pakpattan, 6-R Hakra, Niazbeg and Shahkot (Punjab); Sehra-Naulakhi
(Sind); Warsak Lift (NWFP); and Las Bela (Baluchistan). All these subprojects are served by
IIS, except Las Bela, which receives water supply from the Hub River Dam. Project activities
were to cover about 510,000 acres of cultivable land and 50,000 farm families, with the
expectation that successful initiatives might be replicated elsewhere in Pakistan.
3.3        The project, as agreed at negotiations, comprised the following components:
(a)        Canal Rehabilitation and Remodelling. Total provisions for all subprojects were:
(i) rehabilitation of about 246 miles of distributaries using technology developed
under the Irrigation Systems Rehabilitation Project (ISRP, Cr. 1239-PAK);
(ii) remodelling of about 26 miles of canals and 1,332 outlets, lining of about 188
miles of minors and distributaries, and repairs/replacement of canal structures; and
(iii) vehicles and survey equipment required for implementing these works.
(b)        Drainage. This component included: (i) improvement of surface drains covering
about 60,000 acres in the Shahkot, 6-R Hakra, Warsak Lift and Las Bela
subprojects; (ii) construction of 80 automated tubewells for subsurface drainage of
about 46,000 acres in the 6-R Hakra and Shahkot areas, and about 55 miles of
channels to convey drainage effluent; and (iii) provision of vehicles and survey
equipment for supervision of drainage works.
(c)        On-Farm Water Management (OFWM). This component covered all subprojects
and included: (i) renovation of about 1,050 watercourses, involving 900 miles of
cement-brick lining (modelled after the OFWM Project, Cr. 1163-PAK) and



- 3 -
improvement of the remaining sections of communal watercourses; (ii) permanent
outlets, about one for each 10 acres, and about four culverts for each watercourse;
(iii) precision land levelling of about 20,000 acres; (iv) establishment of one acre
demonstration plot on each renovated watercourse; and (v) vehicles, motorcycles
and equipment for OFWM activities.
(d)       Project Management.  This component included:  (i) incremental staff for a
Federal Coordinating Cell (FCC) in the Ministry of Water and Power (MWP),
Subproject Management Offices (SMOs) and other Provincial agencies; (ii) 877
staff-months of local supervisory consultants and 252 staff-months of expatriate
technical assistance (TA team); (iii) training of project staff, WUA officials, and
farmers; and (iv) provision of facilities, vehicles, and equipment.
3.4       Project Costs. Total cost for the five-year implementation period (FY85-89) was
estimated at Rs 1,105.3 million or US$81.9 million (Part III/5A). Approximately 84% of this
cost was for civil works and equipment, 8.8% for technical assistance and training, and 7.2%
for administration, engineering and operation and maintenance (O&M). The IDA credit of SDR
43.7 million (US$46.5 million equivalent) was to finance the canal improvement and drainage
components, as well as services of supervisory consultants and recurrent costs. The USAID
grants of US$25.0 million was to fund the OFWM component, TA team, training, and
equipment required for these functions. The remaining cost of US$10.4 million was to be met
by domestic sources.
4. Project Design and Organization
4.1       Project Concept. The project evolved from the "command area management"
concept first articulated in RAP. This concept envisaged the integration of specialized agencies
at the canal command level, with the objective of increasing agricultural production by
strengthening the management of irrigated agriculture in an integrated and collaborative manner.
A good conceptual foundation for the project was developed as a result of substantial dialogue
between IDA, GOP and the Provinces. The project was to draw upon the experience of the
ISRP and OFWM Projects but was innovative in its attempt to bring together for the first time
the other major policy and institutional recommendations of RAP. The Provincial Irrigation and
Agriculture Departments (PIDs and PADs), and project beneficiaries shared and understood the
need for infrastructure construction. In retrospect, it seems that the real core of the CWM
concept - social organization and institutional development - was not clear to the relevant parties.
4.2        Project Scope and Timing. In the light of its declared objectives, the scope and
scale of the project were appropriate to field test critical strategies for determining. their
feasibility and replicability. Timing of the project was also appropriate because of GOP's
requirement to implement the project during the Sixth Plan period. Project size was chiefly
determined by the provision made in this plan.



- 4 -
4.3        Project Preparation. WAPDA prepared the project feasibility study, which was
financed by the UNDP. USAID supplied 15 staff-months of expatriate experts to assist WAPDA
in project preparation. WAPDA's report served as the basis for project appraisal, although it
showed some evidence of inadequate preparation. This took the form of inadequate justification
for selection of the subproject areas which, according to the initiating Project Brief, was to be
based on an economic land classification system.  Another deficiency was that adequate
investigations were not carried out to identify areas in need of drainage. On other technical and
agro-economic aspects, WAPDA's project plan was well conceived and adequately prepared.
4.4        Project Organization. For project implementation, special emphasis was placed
on strengthening the existing institutions and on building a new mechanism to improve
coordination amongst them. The PIDs and OFWM Directorates of PADs were to be responsible
for implementation of canal improvement and on-farm works, respectively. The mechanism for
coordinated improvements included three new entities:  the Provincial Policy Committees
(PPCs); the SMOs; and the Subproject Coordinating Committees. FCC in MWP was to provide
overall direction and coordination. The roles and responsibilities for these institutions/entities
were clearly defined and reasonably well understood. Provision was made for continuous M&E
at the subproject level and a mid-term overall evaluation by a suitable, independent institution".
4.5        The project's success apparently lies in efficient execution of civil works. On the
other hand, it has not developed a clear vision of what was to be achieved with respect to its
other objectives (generally called non-civil-works activities), nor of how best to achieve them.
Several reasons can be suggested to explain this situation. The project earmarked the bulk of
funds for civil works activities, project-stated objectives notwithstanding. These activities,
therefore, dominated the time and attention of a majority of the agencies and individuals
associated with the project. The SAR-specified monitoring indicators were also dominated by
the readily quantifiable civil works. Measurement criteria for change in social organization and
institutional development were nowhere specified, and thus no guidance directed project
resources toward achievement of non-civil-works activities.
5. Project Implementation
5.1        Significant Variances. The most significant variances between planned and actual
project implementation were delayed start and three one-year extensions to allow construction
of additional irrigation works. Due to depreciation of the Rupee and US dollar against the SDR,
credit disbursement amounted to only SDR 15.70 million (35.9% of the credit) by the original
closing date (December 31, 1989), despite the fact that most works had been completed. The
project was, therefore, expanded and the closing date extended to December 31, 1992. Total
disbursement reached SDR 42.69 million (97.7% of the credit), and the remaining balance of
SDR 1.01 million was cancelled (Part III/3).
I/  Was carried out by USAID sponsored "Irrigation Support Project for Asia and the Near East" (ISPAN).



- 5 -
5.2        The credit became effective on March 28, 1985, six and a half months later than
planned due to delay in signature of the USAID/GOP cofinancing documents. The project also
experienced a slow start due primarily to delayed appointment of the supervisory consultants -
about eight months after credit effectiveness. Some of the time lost in these actions could have
been avoided. Civil works became the focus of project implementors and despite initial delays
construction targets were achieved.  By the end of the extended implementation period,
achievements substantially exceeded the SAR targets, and works covered about 883,000 acres
or 173% of the original project area (Part 111/4).
5.3       In early 1991, USAID withdrew from the project as a part of an overall program
of reducing its involvement in Pakistan due to political considerations. On the Borrower's
request, IDA agreed (April 1991) to extend its funding to cover activities previously supported
by USAID. In particular, it agreed to finance improvement of watercourses and associated
services of local consultants.
5.4        Total actual project costs amounted to Rs 2,059.2 million or US$100.1 million,
representing an increase over the appraisal estimate of about 86% in Rupee terms and 22% in
US$ terms (Part III/5A). The cost increase in Rupees was largely attributable to the upscaling
of irrigation works; in fact, cost per hectare in Rupees was about the same as expected at
appraisal. The share of civil works and equipment remained roughly unchanged with about 81 %
against about 84% estimated at appraisal.
5.5        Civil Works. In comparison to SAR estimates, actual physical achievements are:
canal rehabilitation/remodeling - 124%; canal lining - 261%; outlet remodelling - 123%; surface
drains - 120%; and watercourse improvement - 139%. The only shortfall occurred in the
construction of drainage tubewells. Some 44 tubewells (55% of the appraisal target) have not
been installed in the 6-R Hakra subproject area due to delayed investigations. The quality of
civil works construction appears to be good.
5.6        Non-Civil-Works Activities. Agricultural and water management activities suffered
from the short tenure of the TA team and its limited participation in project decision making.
The team was fully mobilized only in August 1986, when the civil works program had already
been established. The main activities included: precision land levelling; popularization of
drought- and salt-resistant crops; improved sowing methods; planting high-yielding crop
varieties; applying fertilizer more effectively; and adopting recommended packages of crop
technology. About 2,000 demonstration plots were established to show farmers effective ways
of improving water and crop management. Some of the demonstrations carried out in the
different subproject areas were insufficiently focused on prevailing farming systems. Data were
collected haphazardly and seldom subjected to rigorous analysis, limiting the effectiveness of the
demonstration plots. Attempts at improving irrigation scheduling initially did not take into
account the fact that the canal system in Pakistan is water scarce by design. It was later
recognized that the improved calendar method was therefore more appropriate than complicated



- 6 -
scheduling models. The activities of the TA team also suffered from the absence of a structured
role for agricultural extension agents in the project.
5.7         During project implementation, institutional development received little attention,
and suffered as a result. Institutional development activities were hindered by a lack of clear
direction. The FCC had its limitations to promote project objectives concerning provincial
institutions. The PPCs met regularly (except in NWFP) but made little contribution in furthering
the project's institution building objectives. The SMOs were constrained by the absence of
shared understanding of the project's specific objectives in institution building, guidance
regarding how to proceed, personnel to actively pursue these objectives, and funding to support
relevant initiatives. Still, the formation of SMOs, and the limited progress made under unusual
circumstances was creditable. Strengthening of about 1,600 project-related WUAs was also
constrained by low levels of organizational, technical, and managerial skills among the WUAs
or provided by the project. There was also lack of incentive for further cooperative endeavor
after completion of watercourse renovation. A formal WUA federation was organized in the
Shahkot subproject area, and similar federations emerged on their own in the Pakpattan, Warsak
Lift and Sehra-Naulakhi subproject areas. Nonetheless, the creation of such federations in the
context of inactive and/or short-lived WUAs is, at best, questionable."
5.8         M&E of non-civil-works activities was to be carried out by the SMOs, in
collaboration with the TA team. M&E was undertaken for about two years after completion in
1988 of a baseline survey in each subproject area. But, for the most part, data were collected
in a largely unsystematic manner and were not entered into any management information system.
Some M&E documentation was prepared by the SMOs and the TA team, but these efforts were
of varying quality and yielded inconclusive results.
5.9         Project Risks.  The major risk identified at appraisal related to achieving an
efficient project management organization. This assessment was not fine-tuned in terms of
institution building aimed at integrated management of irrigated agriculture. It was optimistic
to assume that the CWM approach could be institutionalized in Pakistan's irrigated agriculture
sector over five years. Hindsight shows that the suggestion made by federal officials at appraisal
to establish a post of Additional Chief Secretary for irrigated agriculture in each province might
have proved a better long-term alternative to institutional arrangements ending with the project.
"  Current thinking is that in order to stay active WUAs should perform functions essential for irrigation such
as delivery of irrigation water and collection of irrigation fees. These functions were not envisaged for WUAs
under the project.

6. Project Results
6.1         The absence of reliable data on agricultural and social indicators makes a thorough
assessment of project results difficult." Despite this shortcoming, the PCR mission's view is
that the project generally achieved its objective of raising agricultural production and farm
incomes. Great satisfaction with the results of civil works has been expressed by all relevant
agencies, and by most of the farmers interviewed by the mission. On the other hand, the project
had little success in developing an institutional model for integrated management of irrigated
agriculture.
6.2         Changes in Crop Production. The project now covers about 883,000 acres and
85,000 farm families. The area covered is 73 % larger than foreseen at appraisal. Water savings
from canal improvements and watercourse renovation are reported to be equal to or more than
assumed at appraisal2". As a result, there have been significant increases in annual cropping
intensities and crop yields (Annex 1, Tables 5 and 6). The average cropping intensity for all
subprojects rose from 122% to 140%, which is only slightly lower than the SAR target of 144%.
However, individual subproject areas show mixed results. The increase in cropping intensity
ranges from 100% in Las Bela to none in Shahkot and Niazbeg.3 In Sehra/Naulakhi, the
largest subproject, cropping intensity increased from 114% to 138% and exceeded the appraisal
estimate by 8%.
6.3         Yield increases range from 6.6%  for orchards to 35.5% for rice and remained
generally below SAR targets. The main factors influencing yields have been the improved
supply of water and its better distribution among farmers along the canal system rather than
improved agricultural production techniques. Changes in cropping pattern were influenced
largely by the general market and price situation rather than project interventions. The cotton
area, for example, is now about 309,000 acres, representing an increase of about 73% against
the SAR expectation of 12-22%.
6.4         Effects on Farm Income. Farm models (Annex 1, Tables 7 to 13) show that farm
incomes in the subproject areas have increased from 22% to 45 %, with two exceptions. In Las
Bela, farm income grew by 235 % reflecting the particularly favorable situation of this area as
a producer of high value fruit crops for the nearby Karachi market. In Niazbeg, where cropping
intensities did not improve, income growth is below average.
" Local officials expressed their interest in a systematic survey and evaluation of the project, because of their
general feeling that this project's success deserves to be well documented.
2/ Based on observations made in Punjab, especially in the Niazbeg subproject area.
3/ In Niazbeg current cropping intensity is reported to be 162%, which is not significantly different from the
164% reported in the baseline survey. However, these figures are lower than the SAR cropping intensity
assumptions of 172% without project and 184% with project.

6.5        Economic Re-evaluation. The
project's re-estimated ERR is 23% (Annex               Ecoomk Ratot Rebu
1, Table 16), only slightly below  the                                          SAR f  _ _  _  h
appraisal estimate of 24% despite lower i           l l l
than expected yields increases.  This is !1  ! l

30%; and (ii) higher economic prices for    Wk-
some major products.  Original and re-           -           , L -              -
estimated ERRs of the subprojects are
shown in the Chart. Details are in Annex
1, Tables 7 to 13.
6.6        Recovery of Costs of Materials.  Beneficiaries are required to contribute, in
addition to labor, 20% of the cost of materials for watercourse lining in the Punjab subprojects,
25% in the Sind and Baluchistan subprojects, and 10% in the NWFP subproject. Repayment
is to be made over five years after a two-year grace period. In Punjab, the cost recovery status
is considered to be satisfactory and generally on schedule. In Sind, cost recovery stopped after
payments in 1990 of early instalments and amounts due are expected to be recovered as arrears
of land revenue. While recovery is delayed in Baluchistan, it is slow in NWFP because farmers
did not receive the full amount of canal water, due to problems with motors at the main pumping
station. "
6.7        Institutional Aspects. Although the institutional development process is bound to
be slow, the project has had little impact on institutional development. The project's objectives
related to institutional development can, therefore, be deemed to have not been met. The
creation of SMOs did not lead to a more integrated approach and a reorientation away from
compartmentalized line agency thinking. There was improvement in the capacity of the relevant
provincial agencies for planning and execution of civil works. Most WUAs played an active
role during project implementation, particularly in the lining of their watercourses, but became
inactive after completion of civil works. Only a very limited number of WUAs are engaged in
joint purchasing and other collaborative activities related to non-water input management.
6.8        Training.  Diagnostic analysis of training for the staff of SMOs and OFWM
Directorates took place in 1985 and was followed by management training and planning in 1986.
There is no evidence of this effort having lasting results.  The diagnostic analysis model
designed by a US-based university was judged to be too cumbersome, time consuming, and
"  Replacement of motors financed by USAID is now nearly complete.



complicated to have practical use in an irrigation rehabilitation project. Training management
staff in M&E operations and representatives of WUAs was also deficient with little lasting
impact.
7. Project Sustainability
7.1         Maintenance of civil works in the subproject areas is critical to a sustained project
impact. A continuing program of maintenance and repair of canals, drains and tubewells by
PIDs requires adequate financial resources. There is a risk that funds allocated for O&M may
not be sufficient. Water charges have been decreasing in real terms. Between 1985 and 1993,
the increase in water charges was generally about 25% to 28% and thus far lower than the
inflation of about 75% over the period." Despite most of the WUAs being inactive, the PCR
mission noted during field visits that maintenance of renovated watercourses received adequate
attention from farmers.
8. Bank Performance
8.1        IDA made a positive contribution in meeting 57%  of total actual cost and also
showed great flexibility in dealing with changing project needs. At the Borrower's request, three
amendments were made to the DCA. These included the financing of non-residential buildings
as well as watercourse renovation and motors for the Warsak Pumping Stationr' following
USAID's withdrawal. IDA staff contributed to the successful execution of civil works through
timely professional advice. However, some shortcomings were evident over the project cycle.
The IDA identification mission recommended a project encompassing one million acres and
proposed its appraisal in July 1981. During project preparation, both these assumptions proved
to be very optimistic. There were seven preparation missions from March 1981 to August 1983,
each with four to eight combined assignments. No mission was adequately staffed to deal with
the multidisciplinary nature of the project. The final joint IDA and USAID appraisal team was
well balanced in required disciplines but was not fully successful in creating a clear focus on the
project's specific institution building objectives.  IDA's supervision effort through eleven
missions was generally satisfactory, with good staff continuity. These missions had only limited
success in focusing the Borrower's attention on institutional objectives and on carrying out an
effective M&E program. The missions generally displayed a restricted role in reminding the
Borrower about the project's non-civil-works objectives. They seldom demonstrated a proactive
and participatory approach regarding how to proceed towards achieving these objectives.
8.2        The main lessons to be learned from the experience of the project, which may be
relevant to other projects, are:  (i) while designing projects for canal command area
development, institutional constraints should be carefully diagnosed, and resources and activities
"  Only in Las Bela, water charges were kept more or less in line with inflation rates.
2/ The motors were ultimately financed by USAID.



- 10 -
must be focused on achieving declared objectives (para 4.5); (ii) projects financed by more than
one donor should be governed by an internally consistent set of planning documents (para 12.1);
(iii) a project aimed at raising agricultural production must delineate a structured role for
agricultural extension services (para 5.6); (iv) the multidisciplinary content of a CWM project
requires a more proactive and participatory standard in project supervision rather than routine
reporting of progress and issues (para 8.1).
9. Borrower Performance
9.1        The Borrower mainly focused on civil works and neglected institutional development
and related objectives. Performance also fell short in some critical areas, particularly the
execution of a M&E program for impact assessment, the handling of WUAs, and the use of the
TA team. Borrower performance was good during project preparation and processing. Part
III/7 reviews the status of covenants. Except for delays in submitting audit reports and the M&E
program, the Borrower's compliance with covenants has been satisfactory. No effort was made
to structure SMOs as an effective model of decentralized management to realize integrated
management of water and non-water inputs in the subproject areas. The PPCs were not of much
help towards achieving the objective of integrated management of irrigated agriculture.
9.2        The relevant lessons that can be learned by the Borrower are:  (i) integrated
management of irrigated agriculture needs a radical reorientation away from compartmentalized
line agency thinking (para 5.7); (ii) M&E operations must be instituted from the start of project
implementation and need to be well organized and systematic to develop a strong management
information system and, as a result, a continuously evolving coherent management strategy (para
5.8); (iii) WUAs will continue to be active if there are functions for which all members have
sufficient interest (which calls for OFWM Directorates to go beyond blueprint construction)
(para 5.7); (iv) expatriate technical assistance must be closely integrated into the objectives and
operations of the project (para 11.2); and (v) water scheduling promoted by expatriate experts
must take into account that the Indus canal system is water scarce by design, and farmers tend
to maximize income per unit of available water by expanding cropped area rather than applying
optimum amounts of water to crops (para 5.6).
10. Project Relationship
10.1      IDA relationship with GOP and implementing agencies on the project has been
good. IDA and Borrower maintained cordial working relationships with USAID and local
consultants.
11. Consulting and Contracting Services
11.1      Local Consulting and Contracting Services. The supervisory consultants assisted
FCC and PIDs, and the OFWM consultants supported watercourse renovation. Because of the
three project extensions and also the additional duties assigned to them, the use of supervisory



- 11 -
consultants went up from 877 to 1,752 staff-months. The OFWM consultants accounted for an
additional 1,466 staff-months. Performance by both consultants was generally satisfactory, and
proved to be useful to GOP and implementing agencies. They helped in enhancing standards
of civil works. Local contractors undertook all works related to canal improvement and
drainage. The quality of construction was generally adequate at all sites. The experience gained
by these contractors, who will carry out future maintenance and repair work, will thus contribute
to a higher degree of sustainability.
11.2      Technical Assistance Team. Actual cost of expatriate experts amounted to about
US$7.3 million, representing an increase of about 83% over the appraisal estimate. This
happened despite the late arrival and early departure of the TA team. It was extremely difficult
for the PCR mission to judge the effectiveness of this team, based on interviewing only one local
official of USAID and provincial personnel. However, there was an apparent failure of the TA
team and SMOs to devise a coherent strategy which effectively linked diagnostic and baseline
surveys, annual planning activities, periodic progress reporting, and M&E operations into a
strong information system.
12. Project Documentation
12.1      The DCA and Project Agreements with the four Provinces were clear and adequate
to meet the project's changing needs. Targets set out in the SAR for civil works provided a
sound framework for participating agencies, whereas the SAR only emphasized process and the
potential for non-civil-works activities.  In addition to these IDA  documents, project
implementation was governed by the Borrower's PC-Is as well as by the USAID project
agreement, its over 100 project implementation letters, and the contract for technical assistance.
A problem with these multiple planning documents were some conflicting messages about project
objectives and the relative priority to be assigned to different project activities.
12.2      A draft PCR prepared by the supervisory consultants (February 1993) was a useful
reference document. Other relevant information was readily available, except for the evaluation
of project impact.

PAKISTAN
COMMAND WATER MANAGEMENT PROJECT
COMPLETION REPORT
PART-Il
GENERAL
1-        The Command Water Management Project (IDA-Credit
1487-PAK) Pakistan aimed at strengthening management
of existing institutions, infrastructures, agricultural input
and  services  in  order to  efficiently  remove  major
constraints to irrigated agriculture production in selected
sub-project areas. There were seven selected sub-project
areas, four in Punjab and one each in Sindh, NWF and
Balochistan provinces. The Shahkot, Niazbeg, Pakpattan
and 6R(HAKRA) Subprojects were located in Punjab while
Naulakhi/Sehra in Sindh, Warsak Lift in NWFP and Lasbela
in Balochistan. The main objectives of the Project were to:
increase agriculture production through improved
water management, alongwith efficient supply of
agricultural services and non-water inputs;
develop   water  management  techniques  and
programmes replicable over a wide range of agro-
climatic zones;
build within the provincial agencies a continuing
capability for planning, implementing, operating and
maintaining integrated and efficient programmes of
irrigated agriculture; and
strengthen farmers participation by forming Water
Users Associations (WUAs) to improve their overall
water and non-water input management and provide
them opportunity to have a stronger voice in decision
making.



13 -
2-            The financial assistance to the Project was provided by the
World Bank (IDA) and United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) SDR 43.7 million and
US $ 25.0 million respectively)
3-            The project was initially scheduled to be completed  upto
June   30,1 989.        However  its  completion   date   was
extended upto December 31,1992 to carry out additional
activities within the subprojects and in the adjoining areas
on the demands of farmers from the funds that became
available as a result of appreciation of values of SDR and
US$ as compared to Pak-Rupee.
MAJOR CHANGES
4-            As stated in Para(3) above, the scope of the Project was
substantially increased on the demand of the farmers of
the  adjoining  areas.    The  original  scope  and   actual
achievement are given in Table-I:

BANK PERFORMANCE
The contribution of the World Bank to the successful completion of the
Project through supportive relationship and professional advice was
commendable.   The  members  of supervision  Mission  were  always
highly qualified in their respective fields. Their periodical visits were
very constructive and useful in the implementation of the Project. The
performance of the World Bank Resident Mission, Islamabad has been
efficient, and they always provided timely and constructive advice as a
result of which it has been possible to achieve high targets as
compared to those provided in the SAR. Their response had always
been positive in solving the procedural problems and bottlenecks. List
of World Bank's Supervision Missions during the period from October
1985 to December, 1992 is as below:-
Mission                                       Period of Mission

- 18 -
The contribution of procurement/disbursement unit towards training of
staff of the implementing agencies and Consultants in the preparation
of disbursement claims was extremely useful. The disbursement unit
of World Bank Resident Mission, Islamabad worked efficiently and their
approach was always positive and result-oriented.
BORROWERS PERFORMANCE
In general, the overall performance of the borrower was satisfactory
and achievements have been much more than the envisaged targets of
the Project in the SAR except on two Components i.e. Sub-surface
Drainage of 6R (HAKRA) Sub-project and Remodelling of Outlets on.
Warsak Lift Canal as in evident from the data given in Table-I above.
In case of Sub-surface drainage in 6R(HAKRA) sub-project, detailed
studies were required due to heterogeneity of soil strata of the area.
These studies were taken up very late by PID, Punjab with the help of
National Tubewell Construction Corporation (NTCC), Lahore and by the
time these studies and subsequent formalities were completed, no time
was left for procurement of Tubewells on ICB basis. The Remodelling
of Outlets on Warsak Lift Canal could not be taken up due to socio-
political reasons.
CONSULTANTS PERFORMANCE
The Local Supervisory Consultants who were to prepare the agreed
criteria, supply design and process the schemes, were appointed about
9-months later than their scheduled appointment.  The Consultants
after coming into position put in heart and soul together and got
approved design criteria, prepared designs, reviewed the schemes and
arranged issuance of authorization letter for execution of works from
the competent authorities.  The Consultants maintained this tempo
throughout the Project and in all reviewed and cleared 668 schemes
costing Rs. 1,208,905 million in addition to preparation of 912 No.
design drawings, preparation/publishing of 88 documents for the
guidance of Project staff and attending meetings at different tiers. The
Consultants had to carry out extensive touring for spot checking to
control quality and provide guidance to the staff of the implementing
agencies.  The Consultants throughout the Project remained under
pressure due to inadequacy of staff, other facilities to achieve high
targets as compared to the envisaged targets.



- 19 -
CO-FINANCIERS PERFORMANCE
The co-financier in the  Project was USAID.   In general, the
relationships were satisfactory. The USAID during December, 1990
showed their inability to finance new civil works activities relating to
improvement of water-courses for which the Project Implementation
Letters (PILs) were not issued by them till that time. This put the
Borrower and the IDA came to the rescue and these activities were
thereafter funded by the World Bank keeping in view the integrated
approach of the Project i.e. the improvement of the water conveyance
system upto field level through canals and water-courses.

2.              Since the project works were confined to very
small parts, scattered amongst few canal commands of the whole
irrigation and drainage systems of Pakistan$ it was not practicable
to introduce the institutional changes unless the whole management
system particularly the canal command of which a tiny part is
included in the Command Water Management Project, is changed.
The system-change on canal command basis can be and is under
discussions at various levels. The lessons learnt from implementation
of Command Water Manageent Project would also serve as a guideline
for improvements in the structural/institutional system.

Comments:
Major issues raised at each stage of project processing are reported below. These issues are as recorded in the Project Briefs
of June 1980 and August 1983, Issues Paper dated November 15, 1983, Decision Memorandum issued on December 2, 1983,
and Minutes of Negotiations agreed in April 1984.
Identification: The major issues to be addressed in project preparation were: (i) how to institutionalize the CWM concept of
integrating specialized water and agriculture agencies at the canal command level and to strengthen their capability for increasing
agricultural production; (ii) organization of WUAs for the involvement of farmers in watercourse improvement and maintenance,
water scheduling and tubewell operation; (iii) study and field experimentation on watercourse improvement technology; (iv)
provision for a sound O&M program for all project works; (v) arrangements for adequate cost recovery, particularly in relation
to on-farm and watercourse improvements; and (vi) need to evaluate selection of canal systems and to design economically viable
components based on an economic land classification system.
Preparation: The following key issues were to be discussed at appraisal and agreement was to be reached with GOP during
negotiations: (i) institutional arrangements and coordination of water and agriculture services at the provincial and subproject
levels; (ii) cost recovery with a focus on reinforcing long-range covenants, including increase in water charges for public
tubewells: (iii) need to better define requirements, monitor and provide funding for adequate O&M of the irrigation system; and
(iv) investment priorities in the water sector.
Appraisal: The mission raised the following project issues that required further discussion with GOP, Provincial Governments,
USAID and Bank management: (i) institutional arrangements worked out and agreed with Provincial officials regarding six basic
functions:  policy, management, evaluation and scheduling, program  implementation, input-output transformation, and
monitoring; (ii) proposals by Federal officials to strengthen organizational arrangements by granting budgetary control at project
level and by establishing the post of Additional Chief Secretary in each province to direct and coordinate activities of PID and
PAD: (iii) a program for divesting public tubewells in fresh groundwater areas and/or ensuring appropriate level of funding and
improved operation of public tubewells in both fresh and saline groundwater areas; (iv) additional steps required to ensure
continuing improvements in cost recovery in the irrigation and drainage subsectors; (v) project scope and local funding; (vi) level
and allocation of external funding; and (vii) possible conflict with IDA procurement guidelines due to limitation placed on
imports of major equipment.
Key issues noted in the Decision Memorandum were cost recovery, improvement in O&M, Federal/Provincial financial relations,
and investment priorities in irrigation.



- 24 -
Negotiations: The major issue related to the level (300 staff-months) and mix of expatriate technical assistance and to the high
rate of US$24,750 per staff-month given in the draft SAR. This issue required some follow-up and was resolved to the
satisfaction of all concerned after the expatriate technical assistance was reduced to 252 staff-months, the billing rate was
reduced, and agreement was reached on a review of expatriate technical assistance inputs by the end of the second project year.
Agreement was also reached after negotiations on the use of separate local consultants for the USAID-financed watercourse
renovation program.
Board Presentation: There were no special conditions for Board presentation.

U' tS$ figures converted at Rs 13.5 per US$1 throughout.
Convened at Rs 14.5 per US$1, the rate used in the USAID Project Paper Amendment.
" Actual figures including Special Account (amount attributable to exchange difference between US$ equivalent at the time funds were
advanced and US$ equivalent at the time the advance was documented [recovered]).
Comments: As a result of the depreciation of the Rupee and US$ against the SDR during the project implementation
period, additional Rupees became available under the IDA credit. It was decided that civil works targets be increased
to cover a larger area and consequently the credit closing date was extended (by a total of three years) to December
31, 1992. As a result, project costs in Rupee terms increased by 63.8% and in US$ terms by 15.4%. This is to be
seen vis-a-vis an expansion in the project area of about 73%. Actual cost per acre amounted to about US$113 (Rs
2,332) compared to the revised estimate of US$170 (Rs 2,465).

Underlying Assumptions (PCR Mission)
Project Life:         30 years.
Phasing:              Generally 0, 0, 0, 20, 30, 50, 70, 80, 90, and 100 percent, with a delayed phasing
in the Warsak subproject and a longer phasing for orchard yield increases in the
Las Bela subproject (details in Annex 1, Tables 7 to 13).
Full Development:   Seven years after completion.
Project Costs:        Actual costs provided by the project authorities and supervisory consultants (Annex
1, Table 1)' were converted to constant 1992-93 terms by adjusting both local and
foreign costs for inflation. Local costs were expressed in border Rupees by
applying a conversion factor of 0.9. Farmers' labor was estimated at 40% of civil
works cost for the OFWM  component.  In addition, reinvestment costs for
tubewell pumps after 16 years and incremental O&M costs were included.2
Prices:               Financial and economic prices used are shown in Annex 1, Table 4. Economic
prices for internationally traded goods are based on World Bank commodity price
forecasts3. For all main traded outputs, except wheat, export parity prices have
been used; import parity prices were used for wheat and fertilizer. Prices for non-
traded goods are based on 1992-93 financial prices translated into border prices by
applying a conversion factor of 0.9, and for unskilled labor a conversion factor of
0.7.
Comments:
This re-evaluation is based on data provided by the PIDs on cropped areas and the PADs and supervisory
consultants on yields and production costs. Both sets of information have to be treated with caution.
The benefit from technical assistance and training outside the project area is considered to be too small to justify a
deduction of part of their costs as done in the SAR.
2 Contrary to SAR assumptions, renovation of the earthen section of improved watercourses is not considered an additional
cost compared to the without project situation, where this work should also be done throughout the length of the watercourse.
Taken from the Second On-Farm Water Management Project PCR (May 1993) and recent SARs for projects in Pakistan.



- 30 -
Reporting of cropped area by PIDs is not always correct. The PADs and supervisory consultants did
no systematic survey in collecting information. Their yield and input use data were obtained by asking
a limited number of farmers. The supervisory consultants could not give the PCR mission any underlying
information, such as location and number of farmers interviewed or information obtained from individual
farmers.
Project impact on yields remains below SAR expectations, while the overall re-estimated ERR is close
to the SAR estimate. The re-estimated ERR benefits from two main variations from SAR assumptions:
(i) investment costs per unit of land were lower due to the extension of the project area; and (ii) economic
prices for some products are higher than originally expected. Particularly for wheat the SAR assumption
of Pakistan becoming a net exporter by 1990 did not take place.

FARM BUDGETS (Tables 7 to 13):
In line with SAR assumptions, the impact of the project on farm incomes has been
reestimated by preparing illustrative farm budgets for all subprojects (presented in Tables 7
to 13). The underlying data on crop yields and production costs are mainly based on
information provided by the supervisory consultants. This information has to be treated with
caution, since no systematic evaluation was done and most of the data were obtained by
interviewing a very limited number of farmers. Most of the information on production cost
has been provided to the PCR mission only as a percentage of gross value of production. This
allowed no estimation of changes in the use of main inputs. The PCR mission was not in a
position to collect its own set of information.
In all subprojects, provision is made for possible disruptions in agricultural production
during the main construction period, resulting in negative figures for net incremental benefits
in the years concerned. This effect is considered to be generally very small, since effective
measures had been taken during civil works construction to avoid any disruption in the flow
of water. However, negative net benefits have been important in Las Bela. There they did
not result from disruptions due to civil works, but from change in the cropping pattern.
Income from producing fodder and vegetables was given up several years before orchards
started to bear fruit.

COMMENTS ON THE WORLD BANK'S
Command Water Management Project (Cr. 1487-PAK)
Project Completion Report (PCR)
by
USAID MISSION TO PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN
Islamabad, Palistan
1.    The Project Completion Report (PCR) is a comprehensive review of the Command
Water Management (CWM) Project, which touches upon all salient features of the Project
from its inception to completion. It consists of very useful observations leading to a realistic
project evaluation.
2.    In the report, it has been clearly observed that CWM Project pilot effort, at best, was
a partially successful venture and it failed to evolve durable infrastructure capable of
sustaining an integrated approach to command area agricultural development. The project
resulted into substantial increase in the agricultural output and the increase in the ERR at the
end of the Project was impressive. It happened because of a major Project input i.e., water
as the rehabilitation and lining of the distributary/minor canals and watercourses resulted in
the saving of substantial quantities of water, which provided better cropping yields/
agricultural output. But the results in the non-water inputs improvemement was rather
disappointing.
3.    In the PCR, it has been identified that:
A.   Water Users Associations were not sustained after the Project
completion, at least beyond the O&M of water courses.
B.    Compartmentalized line agencies could not come out of it to
form integrated teams for serving the Project needs, goals and
objectives.
C.   The cost recovery, in real terms, remained far below the O&M
needs of the irrigation infrastructure.
4.    The PCR, however, does not go beyond this and suggest tangible ways in which these
weaknesses could be redressed. In our opinion, an effort should have been made to suggest
ways and means by which a CWM concept would succeed, if implemented in the future
projects.
5.    The CWM remains a valid concept. In fact, in our opinion, this concept could be
enlarged to bring in its fold, not only the agricultural sector activity, but also the social
sector activities, by which a truly progressive society could emerge from an economic
development effort. Towards this end, we offer a developmental model in the following
paragraphs.



- 55 -
6.    Our inference from the Project was that the present organization and functioning of
the departments serving the agriculture i.e., irrigation, agriculture, extension, livestock,
fishries, forestry, food, land reclamation, etc., are outdated and outmoded. Their enormity
in staff, offices, residential colonies, transport, and equipment gobble up most of the O&M
funds and very little is left for actual work. The lack of accountability deals the death blow
to whatever O&M effort was possible after meeting with the management cost and the matter
just ends there.
There is, therefore, a need to cut down the bulk of organizations, simplify and
modernize the methods and functioning and pass over whatever is possible to the private
sector, which is now quite responsive to commercialization of most of the activities, in the
public sector.
7.    The Water Users Associations formed by the farmers at the lowest level of the
hierarchy, completely devoid of powers, at the mercy of completely un sympathetic
bureaucracy of the public departments and without a political clout to influence the credit
giving /agricultural input providing agencies have been nothing but a bunch of hapless lot of
farmers. If any good is to come to this lot, the situation must be reversed, i.e., the line
agencies must be made to respond to their needs and this can happen only if a change in the
system of management happens.
8.    An integrated cooperative approach from the line agencies was not possible in the
present Project, because staff from various departments had been obtained for the Project
with their permanent lien to their parent departments. The individuals stayed in the CWM
Project, if it suited them, otherwise they manoeuvred to get out at the first opportunity. Our
recommended model takes care of this lacuna as well.
9.    The recommended model of Water Users involvement in the management of their
affairs aims at formulation of Water Users Corporations with elected farmer rpresentatives
from each area of the command of a major canal. The corporations would be staffed from
all line agencies in not only the irrigation, and agriculture departments but also the social
sector. The staff organizations would be light, efficient, competent and effective. The
corporations would function very nuch like city corporations, with powers to levy and collect
taxes, plan expenditures and execute works. Similarly, Water Users Councils could be
formed at the distributary and minor canal levels and Water Users Associations at the
Watercourse level. The necessary staff and facilities from the existing line agencies will be
absorbed in the farmer bodies; the rest would be allowed an honourable discharge.
10.   The Water Users bodies thus formed will be responsive to the farmers needs; the line
agencies staff will be sympathetic to the farmers requirements; the system will be econom
ical not only owing to its organization and method of functioning, but also because it would
utilize the enormous farm labour and farm equipment which is free during certain periods of
cropping seasons.



- 56 -
11.   Care, of course, should be taken that the farmer bodies are not politicized say, by
banning the politicians from the offices of farmers bodies, by limiting the holders of offices
of farmers bodies to a couple of terms. The accountability should be ensured by establishing
independent judicial courts and ombudsman to resolve the disputes and by establishing the
offices of inspector, audit and evaluation to watch the performance of farmer bodies.
12.   The irrigation and agricultural institutions and facilities upstream of canal commands
can be left to the public, quasi-public or private sector per their suitability. These would
consist of canal barrages/water reservoirs, research institutions, data collection and design
institutions, policy formulation bodies, education and training institutions, etc.
13.   Presented here is just an outline of a model, which we think, would address the
agricultural and social development in the rural areas of Pakistan. No doubt, there would be
numerous issues which need elaboration at this stage. We do not envisage any difficulty in
addressing these when implementation of this model is considered appropriate.
