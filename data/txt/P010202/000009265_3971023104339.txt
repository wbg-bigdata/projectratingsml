COMAND WATER MANAGEMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
General
1.01    The Government of Pakistan (GOP) in its Sixth Five-Year Plan
(FY84-88) has included funding for a Command Water Management Project. This
project would incorporate the major policy, institutional, and technical
recommendations of the Revised Action Program for Irrigated Agriculture
(RAP). 1/ The thrust of RAP's recommendation was to significantly improve
agricultural production in the irrigated areas of Pakistan by improving the
delivery efficiency of water and non-water inputs.
1.02    Project preparation was carried out by WAPDA with funding from the
UNDP Project: Investment Project Preparation in the Water, Agriculture, and
Energy Sectors (PAK/81/004), with the Bank as Executing Agency. Expatriate
experts were supplied by the U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID). GOP invited IDA and USAID to jointly appraise a project based on
the feasibility report prepared by WAPDA in August 1983. This report is
based upon the findings of the joint appraisal mission, comprising
W. Fairchild, G. Lituma, C. P. Cheng, J. Mohamadi, U. Qamar, and A. Dolcini
(c) of IDA and R. Backus, P. Kulligan, L. Busch (c), K. Nobe (c), and W.
Andrews (c) of USAID. However, this report hias not been subject to USAID's
review process. Following its procedures, USAID will prepare its own project
paper, which will further elaborate on the project withia the framework of
this report.
Demographic and Physical Features
1.03    Pakistan has a population estimated at 85 M and is growing at a rate
of about 3% per annum. Per capita annual income is only about US$385 (Bank's
estimate for 1983) with approximately 30% of the population having an income
below US$150, which was the estimated absolute poverty level for FY80. Adult
literacy rate of 24% is well below the 50% level reco-ded in comparable
developing countries.
1/ Published in May 1979 by the Water and Power Development Authority
(WAPDA) and based on a four-year Indus Basin Planning Study, funded by
UNDP with the Bank as Executing Agency.



-2-
1.04    Pakistan has a total land area of 197 1 ac, of which 40%, or about
78 M ac is suitable for crop, range and forest production. About 40 M ac of
this is commanded for irrigation, where about 90% of the nation's total
agricultural production is generated. Most of the cultivable land is located
in the Indus plain where the soils are well suited for irrigated agriculture.
1.05    The climate in the Indus Plain is arid to semi-arid and subtropical.
Temperature in most cultivable areas allows all-year cultivation with tem-
perature reaching 120°F in May and June. Annual precipitation is less than 8
in over much of the Indus Plain, whereas pan evaporation may exceed 5 ft,
making irrigation a necessity for agricultural production. Even so, heavy
rainfall does occur during monsoon seasons causing substantial flood damage
(flood loses in excess of US$1,800 M in 1973 and 1976).
Agricultural Performance and Policies
1.06    Despite the gradually declining relative importance of agriculture in
Pakistan's economy, it remains: (a) largest commodity-producing sector; (b)
principal source of income for a majority of the country's population (almost
55% of labor force); (c) most important source of exports (about 42% in
FY82); (d) principal supplier of raw materials for industry; and (e) primary
market for output of non-agricultural sectors.
1.07    During the period FY77-83, Pakistan's annual agricultural growth rate
exceeded 4%, a marked increase over the 1.7% for the FY71-76 period. This
doubling of the agricultural sector growth rate during the late 1970s and
early 1980s can be attributed partly to favorable weather. However, a major
factor was farmer response to changes in GOP's policies during the Fifth
Five-Year Plan period (FY78-83) of improving farm level incentives through
price adjustments, reducing subsidies, encouraging private sector investment
in areas such as input distribution, concentrating on funding efficient
agricultural extension and research services, improving water management at
the farm level and rehabilitating the irrigation systems.
1.08    Even with the recent significant increase in agricultural production,
the average yields for major field crops in Pakistan remains well below that
of similar developing countries. For examaple in FY81, the average yield of
wheat was about 665 kg/ac, rice 650, cotton lint 140, sugarcane 15,850, and
maize 515.  Hence, there remains ample opportunity and potential to further
improve Pakistan's agricultural production. Based on various empirical and
field level surveys in Pakistan, 1/ it has been determined that the major
factors, which would best contribute to increased growth in the crop sector
include: (a) providing timely and assured irrigation water supply; (b)
improving the delivery and availability of quality seeds, fertilizer, insec-
ticides, extension, agricultural credit and muachinery; (c) furthering
farmer's education; and (d) improving the rural infrastructure--particularly
roads, rural electrification and communications. The interaction and the

combination of these factors and their effect on agricultural production were
the basis for agricultural production targets developed bv the GOP for the
Sixth Five-Year Plan. However, optimizing benefits from Lhe interaction of
these factors would require strengthened farmer involvement and institutional
management.
Indus Irrigation System
1.09    The single most significant infrastructural works relating to
agricultural production in Pakistan is the Indus Irrigation System
(34.5 M ac), which is the largest contiguous irrigation system in the world.
The Indus system encompasses the Indus River and its tributaries, three major
storage reservoirs, 19 barrages/headworks, 12 link canals, 43 canal comands
covering about 90,000 chaks. 1/ The total length of the canal system is
about 39,000 mi with watercourses, 2/ field channels, and field ditches
running another 1.0 M mi.  Approximately 100 M ac/ft (maf) of surface irriga-
tion supplies are diverted annually into this canal system. In addition,
approximately 12,500 public tubewells (TWs) and 100,000 private TWs pump
annually an additional 35 maf of irrigation groundwater (see Plate I -- Indus
Plain and Peshawar Vale Water Balance).
1.10    Conveyance of water supplies in excess of design capacity has placed
great stress on the system. This situation coupled with deferred maintenance
has resulted in frequent canal bank breaches and interruption in service.
Overall system irrigation delivery efficiencies are extremely low. Various
studies by the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) indicate that
about 25% of the diverted surface supplies are lost through deep percolation
and evaporation prior to reaching the chaks. The irrigation efficiencies in
the chaks average between 40 and 50%. Inadequate or non-existent surface and
subsurface drainage has resulted in serious surface flooding, a high
groundwater table and associated problems of waterlogging and salinity. 3/ In
addition, there have been continuous technical, financial, and operational
problems associated with the public IW program.
Major Issues
1.11    Water sector issues relating to this proposed project include:  (a)
operation and maintenance (O&M) of the irrigation system; (b) cost recovery;
and (c) institutional arrangements.
1.12    Operation and Maintenance of the Irrigation System.  Because of
deferred maintenance, resulting from inadequate funding, the irrigation
1/ Lowest order command covering, on average, about 400 ac and 35 farms
units.
2/ Watercourse is the communal irrigation delivery facility within each
chak.
3/ Indus Basin Salinity Survey, WAPDA, 1981 indicates that 22% of the Indus
Basin (about 9.0 M ac has a groundwater table within 6 ft. of the surface
and 42% (about 17.0 M ac) within 10 ft.

system Infrastructure became badly deteriorated in the 1970s. This problem
was exacerbated by the high O&M costs associated with the operation of the
12,500 public tubewells (estimated at about Rs 50,000 annually per W).
However, the situation relative to O&M funding for the surface irrigation
system (including surface drainage and flood control works) has improved
significantly in recent years. The Provincial governments (GOProvinces) are
meeting or exceeding the estimated O&M funding targets 1/ for the surface
system as included in covenants for the Irrigation Systems Rehabilitation
Project (Cr. 1239-PAK) and Structural Adjustment Lending-I (Ln. 2166-PAK and
Cr. 1255-PAK). As provided under the Irrigation Systems Rehabilitation
Project (ISRP), the PID-., assisted by USAID appointed O0M Specialists,
reviewed required 0&I funding levels as part of the FY85 O&M annual report.
A working draft of this report was submitted to COP, COProvinces, USAID and
IDA on April 10, 1984. It is now undergoing review (para 6.13). Adequate
O&M for public TWs was not included in the above ISRP covenants but it is
under study in the on-going SCARP Transition study (para 1.15). As required
in the On-Farm Water Management Project (Cr. 1163-PAK), formal Water Users
Associations (WUAs) organized under recently adopted Provincial Ordinances
are required to maintain all watercourse improvements undertaken in the
chaks.
1.13    Cost Recovery.  Under existing IDA assisted projects (Irrigation
Systems Rehabilitation, Cr. 1239-PAK and SAL-I, Ln. 2166-PAK and Cr. 1255-
PAK) all Provinces are required to increase water charges periodically (at
intervals of not more th&n two years and subject to any necessary legislative
approval) or make other appropriate financing arrangements, to achieve full
cost recovery of O&M expenditure by the four Provinces by FY92 or earlier.
This agreement was stated in the context of achieving full recovery of costs
of an idcquate level of O&M (para 1.12) for the surface irrigation system,
including surface drainage and flood control facilitles. Thus far, GOP and
GOProvinces are generally meeting the provisions of the above mentioned
covenants. During FY83, however, water charges covered less than 6OZ of the
irrigation O&M expenditure- for the country's entire irrigation system;
therefore, the need to close the expenditure and cost recovery gap is urgent.
A ma2or cause of the gap between irrlgation O&M expenditures and recoveries
is the high cost of operating public TWs, which is running about Rs 650.0 M
annually in the four Provinces. A major recommendation of RAP was for
privatization of SCARP (salinity control and reclamation projects) public  IWs
in the FGW areas and improved operation of public TWs in the saline
groundwater (SGW) areas. Since about 100,000 private TWs have been installed
in FGW areas, it would appear that existing incentives are sufficient to
encourage private TW development in FGW areas. However, public SWs would
need to continue operating in the SGW areas because near-term benefits would
not appear sufficient to induce private operation. GOP has initiated project
preparation for a SCARP Transition Prolect which is financed under the UNDP
Project, Investment Project Preparation in the Water, Agriculture and Energv
Sectors (PAK/81/004), with the Bank as Executing Agency.  It is envisioned
that the proposed project would provide programs for initiating privatization
1/  Estimated 0&! target for FY85 (1981 prices) are:  Pun4ab Province-
Rs 535.0 V., Send-Rs.320.01M, NWJP-Rs.80.0 M, and Baluchistan-Rs.36.5 M.

of public TWs in FGW areas and improved operation of public SGW TWs. IDA
appraisal of this project is scheduled in late 1984.
1.14    Under the On-Farm Water Management (OFWM) Project (Cr. 1163-PAK),
farmers contribute all unskilled labor for the watercourse renovation works.
In addition, farmers in Punjab and Sind repay over five years a portion of
the costs of materials (20% and 25% respectively without interest) for water-
course renovation. In addition, GOProvinces were to review periodically the
trends on cost recovery with the view to taking necessary steps to increase,
as appropriate, the portions of project cost to be recovered from
beneficiaries.
1.15    Institutional Arrangements.  Improving crop production in irrigated
agriculture requires a high degree of coordination and/or integration of
agencies supplying the water and non-water inputs and services. Currently,
the maior responsibility for supplying these inputs and services at the
Provincial and field levels is split mainly among the Provincial Irrigation
Departments (PIDs), Agricultural Departments and private sector. There is
little evidence to indicate that adequate coordination exists to ensure the
timely availability of agricultural inputs and services. Also, a deficiency
exists in coordinating the supply of surface and groundwater within the PIDs
wh-re responsibility for operation of SCARP TWs and surface irrigation sys-
tems are split at the field level. Until recently, the farmers did not have
an organization through which their views could be effectively aired. With
time, it would appear that formal WUAs (para 1.12) could serve as the vehicle
for improved farmer participation in the planning, construction, O&M of
irrigation facilities, as well as facilitating distribution of required
inputs and services.
Bank's Role and Lending Strategy
1.16    In general, the strategy of the Bank in the water and agricultural
sectors has been to assist GOP in implementing priority projects and programs
by mutually reinforcing and integrating financial and non-financial assis-
tance. This is evidenced by the Bank serving as Executing Agency for the
TJNDP financed Indus Basin Planning Study that resulted in RAP. GOP took the
preliminary findings of RAP as a basis for many of the policy and project
decisions made in the Fifth Five-Year Plan (FY78-83), which emphasized
improved distribution of agricultural inputs and services, and granted top
priority to water sector drainage, water management, and rehabilitation
projects. Bank Group financed projects during this period were consistent
with and supportive of the objectives of GOP's Fifth Plan. The Bank Group
financed projects included, among others: Reservoir Maintenance (Ln.
2247-PAK); Fourth Drainage (Cr. 1375-PAK); Irrigation System Rehabilitation
(Cr. 1239-PAK); Structural Adjustment (Ln. 2166-PAK and Cr. 1255-PAK);
On-Farm Water Management (OFWM) (Cr. 1163-PAK); Agricultural Research
(Cr. 1158-PAK); Grain Storage (Cr. 1157-PAK); Sind Agricultural Extension anc
Adaptive Research (Cr. 922-PAK); and Punjab Extension and Agricultural
Development (Cr. 813-PAK). For the Sixth Five-Year Plan Period (FY84-88),
the Bank lending program in the water sector would continue to support the
successful efforts of the Fifth Plan including this Command Water Management
Project, the Left Bank Outfall Drain now being appraised in Sind Province,
and such other proposed projects as the SCARP Transition, Private IW and

Rural Electrification and second traunches of the successful OFWM and ISRP
Projects.
Rationale for IDA Financing Proposed Project
1.17    This project attempts to bring together for the first time in
Pakistan the major policy, institutional and technical recommendations of
RAP. The proiect is consonant with GOP's objectives and programs in the
Sixth Five-Year Plan. In each subproject, management would be strongly
emphasized to strengthen institutional capacity which would improve the
coordinated delivery of all irrigated agricultural inputs and services to the
farmer. It is envisioned that this project would result in efficient
increases in agricultural production.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
2.01    The Provincial Departments of Planning and Development, Irrigation,
and Agriculture selected the subproject areas for this project. In selecting
these subprojects, GOProvincial officials chose areas that included entire
irrigation commands, which were representative of a wide range of physical
and agroclimatic conditions and whose land ownership and tenancy arrangements
were comparable to the Province as a whole. GOP determined that the size of
the oroject would be limited to about 500,000 ac with the Provincial alloca-
tion generally reflecting (a) funding formula for the Provincial Annual
Development Program (ADP) and (b) the irrigated area within each Province
(see Table 2.1 for subprojects selected by GOProvince).
Location
2.02    The Command Water Management Project (CWMP) comprises seven sub-
projects, four in Punjab and one each in NWFP, Sind, and Baluchistan
Provinces (see IBRD Map 17931). All of these subprojects, except Las Bela
(Baluchistan), are located in the lndus River Basin and are served by the
Indus Irrigation System (paras 1.09 and 1.10). Las Bela is located near
Karachi and received its first water delivery in 1983 from Hub River Dam.
The climate in the subproject areas is characteristic of that described in
para 1.05 for the Indus plain as a whole. These subprojects cover some
610,000 ac, with about 510,000 ac being commanded by irrigation canals (Table
2.1).

Water Resources
2.03    Availability.  The seven subprojects receive irrigation supplies
mainly from surface deliveries. This surface water is of excellent quality.
In addition, Sehra-Naulakhi, Niazbeg, Pakpattan and upper reaches of Shahkot
receive public and private TW water. Groundwater is generally not available
in Las Bela and Warsak Lift subprolects and the groundwater in 6-R and lower
Shahkot is brackish and unsuitable for crop production. Table 2.2 gives a
summary by subproject of the ac/ft of surface water delivered to the head of
the watercourses, the estimated groundwater pumpage, and the crop water
requirements based on the present cropping pattern and intensities, and
irrigation efficiencies. WAPDA estimates that on an annual basis, these
supplies meet a percentage of the requirement ranging from a low of 52X in
Shahkot to a high of 85% in Sehra-Nualakhi. However, during periods of
peak crop water requirements, water supply may meet only 25-35% of such
requirements.

-8-
2.04    The Warsak and Las Bela canals and Niazbeg distributary have physical
constraints that limit surface deliveries. The Warsak Lift canal pumping
station is currently pumping 160 cusecs rather than the 200 cusecs planned.
Negotiations are underway with USAID to install new pumps capable of pumping
200 cusecs, which would increase the canal deliveries to watercourse head
to about 91,000 ac/ft annually under existing conditions. WAPDA wants to
rehabilitate the Las Bela canal, so that it can deliver the full 160 cusecs
as planned rather than the 50 cusecs now being diverted. This would increase
the surface water diverted for irrigation to the Las Bela canal to over
100,000 ac/ft annually. In the lower reaches of the Niazbeg canal, much of
the commanded area cannot be adequately served by gravity irrigation because
of insufficient canal head. Generally, the Indus Irrigation System was
designed to modestly deliver about 3 cusecs/1000 ac to a chak (head of a
watercourse). To meet this planned figure in all subprojects, improvements
indicated above would need to be made as well as providing additional sup-
plies to Niazbeg, Shahkot and Sehra-Naulakhi.
2.05    Irrigation supplies for subprojects with FCW (Pakpattan, Niazbeg, and
Sehra-Naulakhi) are significantly higher than those in the SAW areas (6-R
and portion of Shahkot) and where groundwater is unavailable (Warsak Lift and
Las Bela). The data in Table 2.2 would appear to indicate that in SCARP FGW
areas (Upper Shahkot and Sehra-Naulakhi) farmers do not exploit the
groundwater potential if subsidized public TW water is available, whereas in
non-SCARP IW areas (Pakpattan and Niazbeg), farmers do have the incentive to
install their own private TWs.
2.06    The surface distribution system. For the six subprojects located in
the Indus Irrigation System, the operating condition is typical of that
described in paras 1.09 and 1.10. Through the years, this system has
deteriorated because of deferred maintenance. This deterioration is being
slowly rectified through increased NDB funding to PIDs for required 0&M (para
1.12) and such projects as the Irrigation Systems Rehabilitation Project
(Cr. 1239-PAK). Not only are water losses in the system excessive (only
about 50% of the diverted surface and pumped groundwater supplies reach the
crop) but the supply is unreliable because of breaches in canal banks.
Because of sediment deposition in canals and problems with outlets to water-
courses (moghas), PIDs have difficulty in delivering planned supplies to many
chaks located at the lower end of distributaries and minors. This situation
was verified by WAPDA's measurement of discharges from 186 moghas, which
indicated that about 30% in the tail reaches were drawing less water than the
authorized full supply (afs) compared to 10% in the head and middle reaches.
Also in this survey it was found that 67% of the moghas were drawing more
than the allotted afs. The only control structures installed in the systet
are at the head of canals, branches, distributaries and minors. The head
regulator on the Naulakhi branch canal is in need of repair and is being
replaced by SIND's PID with funding provided in the Provincial ADP. Warsak
Lift and Las Bela subprojects have problems in the distribution system that
are unique to them. The upper reaches of the Warsak canal traverse along the
side of an unstable mountain. Frequent rock slides block the channel, caus-
ing reduced flows and/or breaches in the canal banks. The lower 20-25% of
the Warsak Lift command currently is without water service. Because of low
water deliveries in the Las Bela canal (para 2.04) only the upper four minors
are now receiving water. These minors are constructed of rubble masonry and
are in extremely poor condition. Water losses from the main canal, minors



-9-
and watercourses are excessive because of the poor layout and construction
and the coarse-textured soils of the area. Some of the minors do not have
proper head to command the service area. The length of watercourses in the
Warsak Lift and Sehra-Naulakhi subprojects is extremely long for the areas
served (over 60 ft/ac compated with about 30 ft/ac in Punjab's subprojects).
The reason for these longer watercourses is the old settlements in NWFP and
Sind Provinces.
2.07    Subsurface drainage problems in the subproject areas are currently
limited to the SGW areas in 6-R and lower Shahkot where recently the
groundwater table has been rising by about 0.9 ft and 0.4 ft respectively
each year. The Shahkot subproiect is located in the SCARP I proiect. In
about 20% of the lower subproject area, the groundwater has turned brackish
and the public TW pumping of water for irrigation service has been discon-
tinued. Hence the rise in the groundwater table. WAPDA now estimates that
about 36,000 ac in 6-R and about 10,000 ac in lower Shahkot have a
groundwater table within 5 ft of the surface throughout the year. Thus these
areas are eligible for GOP's designation as a disaster area. It is
anticipated that the high groundwater areas will continue to expand in the
future in these two subprojects. Las Bela received its first irrigation
service in 1983, however it appears that a serious subsurface drainage
problem may quickly develop. This conclusion is predicated on the available
but somewhat limited data, which indicates that bedrock underlays the commsnd
area at a depth of 10-35 ft. In addition, the soils are generally coarse
textured, with very high infiltration rates (0.5 to 1.5 in/hr over much of
the command). It is estimated that some subsurface drainage (horizontal
tile) would probably be required within 10-15 years of full project develop-
ment. WAPDA and Baluchistan PIDs need to monitor this situation and take
corrective actions if and when the situation becomes critical.
2.08    Private and Public TW pumping  generally takes care of the drainage
requirement in the FGW areas. However, groundwater investigations indicate
that the FGW levels in Pakpattan and Niazbeg subprojects are rising slowly
(less than 0.2 ft. annually), which would indicate opportunity for further
groundwater exploitation in these areas. The operation of the public TWs has
generally been on a schedule reflecting the warabundi deliveries of the
surface system. Opportunity exists for such TWs to be operated on a schedule
that would better reflect crop water requirements. Pumpage on such revised
schedule could still meet the dual objective of irrigation and drainage.
Farmers operate private TWs during period they determine critical for crop
production.
2.09    Surface Drainage.  The topography of the subprojects is generally
quite flat and featureless, with much of it having a gradient of less than
.03%. Natural drains are therefore poorly defined and have been further
obliterated by farmers as they have reclaimed natural drainageways for farm-
ing operations. Also, roads, railways, flood embankments, and irrigation
works have further obstructed natural drainage flows. The government has
been actively involved in constructing surface drain since the 1940s. However
as evidenced by the substantial flood damage during some monsoons (para
1.05), there remains a need for vastly expanding the existing surface
drainage system, including drainage outlets for chaks. Also, surface drains
would be required for outlets for the subsurface drainage effluent in the SGW
areas.



-10-
Soil Resources
2.10    Soils in the project area are predominantly moderately coarse to
medium textured, except for the Sehra-Naulakhi subproject (in Sind Province)
which is fine textured. The soils are relatively well drained except for
those located in the waterlogged area of 6-R and lower Shahkot. According to
the 1977-78 WAPDA survey, most of the soils are relatively free of
salinity/sodicity problems.
2.11    WAPDA has divided the soils in the subprojects into eight land
capability classes, with the class I-IV being suitable for crop production
(class IV - marginal), class V-VII being suitable for forestry and grazing,
and class VIII being unproductive. Most of the land is in class I and II,
which means they have the inherent characteristics of being very productive
lands for irrigated agriculture. Las Bela and 6-R have significant amounts
of class VII and VIII lands which are located mostly outside the commanded
areas.
Agricultural Production
2.12    Farm Size and Tenure.  The average size farm unit in Pakistan is
about 12.5 ac. In the project area there are about 50,000 units, of which
about 66% are less than 12.5 ac, 25% range from 12.5 to 25 ac and 9% are
greater than 25 ac. However, about 40% of the cca is in farms of less than
12.5 ac, 33% between 12.5 to 25 ac, and 27% over 25 ac. Also, about 57% of
the farms are either owned or owner-cum-tenant operated, while 43% are tenant
operated.
2.13    Cropping Intensities and Yields.  The cropping intensities in the
subprojects are quite high for Pakistan except for Warsak Lift where reduced
pumping capacity limits delivery of surface water supply, Las Bela where
irrigation service was initiated in 1983, and lower Niazbeg because of poor
command resulting from inadequate head in the distributary. Table 6.1 gives
a breakdown of cropping intensity by subprojects.
2.14    Crop yields in the subproject areas are generally low.  Rice and
wheat in some subproject areas are slightly above the national average.
Maize and sugarcane yields in all subprojects are lower than the national
average. As the waterlogging condition expands in 6-R and lower Shahkot, it
would be expected that the yields in these subprojects would decrease fur-
ther. Table 2.3 gives the FY81 crop yields for the subprojects.

Agricultural Inputs and Services
2.15    Inputs Supply.  The government-owned, tehsil-based bulk depots and
village based subdepots supply most fertilizers, pesticides and seeds.
Beginning in FY80, the private sector began selling fertilizers. The annual
fertilizer consumption, in terms of nutrient per cropped acre, is estimated
at around 30 kg. All fertilizer subsidies are to be phased out by FY86. In
February 1980, the responsibility for sale and distribution of pesticides was
transferred from the Extension Service to the private sector. All pesticide
subsidy was withdrawn in 1983. Pesticide usage is sparse. The use of
certified seeds in the subproject areas is very low with less than 10% of
required wheat, rice and cotton seed being certified at the present time.
2.16    Agricultural Credit.  Major sources of agricultural credit in the
subproject areas are: the Agricultural Development Bank, Federal and Provin-
cial Banks for Cooperatives and Commercial Banks. Small farmers are granted
interest free production loans upto Rs6,000 in kind for seed, fertilizer: and
pesticides provided they repay within 2 months after harvesting.
2.17    Agricultural Extension has been strengthened in various districts
of Punjab and Sind Province on a pilot basis to maximize production of
specific crops. Cotton maximization schemes (CMS) cover seven districts in
Punjab (including 6-R subproject) whereas the Training and Visits (T&V)
program of agricultural extension covers five districts in Punjab (Pakpattan
and Shahkot subprojects) and five in Sind (Sehra/Naulakhi).
2.18    Surveys conducted by WAPDA during preparation for this project indi-
cated that farmers receive inadequate assistance from the Agricultural Exten-
sion Service, and small farmers have extreme difficulty in availing themsel-
ves of agricultural credit. Obtaining the required fertilizer and pesticides
is difficult because of logistical problems and this becomes particularly
acute in the more remote villages.

III. THE PROJECT
3.01    The five-year project (FY85-89), which is highly di:isible, comprises
seven subprojects. The subprojects are located in all four Provinces and
total about 510,000 acres (paras 2.01 and 2.02). The project would consist
of the following components: canal rehabilitation and remodeling; drainage;
on-farm water management, and project management (see Annex 1, Tables 1-12
for detailed cost by subproject, component and expenditure categories). The
implementation schedule (para. 5.24 and Annex 2) limits the first year's
civil works construction to the OFWM component. Plans and designs for this
component are done as a continuing program, which will enable renovation of
160 watercourses in FY85 as scheduled. Designs for the canal rehabilitation
and remodeling, and drainage components would be initiated in FY85, thereby
permitting construction to begin in FY86 as scheduled. Assurances have been
obtained from GOP and GOProvinces that specifications for all civil works
would be satisfactory to IDA.
Project Concept and Objectives
3.02    Project concept is the strengthened management of the existing
institutions, infrastructure, agricultural inputs and services, so as to
efficiently remove major constraints to irrigated agricultural production in
selected subproject areas. In irrigated areas, the adequacy and reliability
of the water supply are the key to agricultural production. Small farmers
cannot afford the risk of applying expensive inputs unless they are assured
of a reliable supply, which has not been the case in Pakistan (para 2.06).
Hence in this project, improvements to and strengthened management of the
irrigation infrastructure are emphasized in association with improved
deliveries of non-water inputs and services. In the subproject areas, a wide
range of institutional and physical improvements were considered. Com-
ponents, and portions thereof that would most efficiently remove major
agricultural production constraints have been included in this project.
Unprogrammed but feasible components would be installed in the post project
period as funding becomes available.
Objectives
3.03    Project Objectives are:
(a) increase agricultural production through improved water
management, along with efficient supplying of agricultural
services and non-water inputs;
(b) develop water management techniques and programs replicable over
a wide range of agroclimatic zones;
(c) build within the Provincial agencies a continuing capability
for planning, implementing, operating and maintaining integrated
and efficient programs of irrigated agriculture; and



-13-
(d) strengthen farmer participation in formal water user associations
to improve their overall water and non-water input management and
provide them an opportunity to have a stronger voice in decision
making.
Canal Rehabilitation and Remodeling (Estimated Base Cost US$25.9)
3.04    Canal rehabilitation and remodeling would be undertaken in all seven
subprojects.  In addition to the required civil works, the project would
provide funds for a limited amount of equipment, investigations and surveys,
and recurring costs for this component.
3.05    Canal rehabilitation would be modeled after the ongoing ISRP
(Cr. 1239-PAK). Hence, this work would be carried out in all seven sub-
projects and would be governed by the general specifications and criteria of
ISRP. This rehabilitation would restore canals to that required for the safe
and efficient conveyance of irrigation water based on present operating or
design capacities. Except for the Las Bela and Warsak Lift subprojects,
rehabilitation would be limited to earthwork and repair and replacement of
hydraulic structures. The major quantity of earthwork would be to: (a)
raise the height of the canal banks to secure required operating freeboard;
and (b) widen canal banks to improve safety of operation and provide an
adequate canal road. Works to be included would be those which are not
funded in IRSP.
3.06    The Warsak Lift rehabilitation would consist of improving the
masonry, as well as the earthen portion of the canal. The upper reaches of
the canal traverses along the steep slope of an unstable mountain. In this
section, covered escapes would be provided to bypass debris from rock slides.
Las Bela rehabilitation would include repair to the existing lined canal
(para 2.04).
3.07    Canal remodeling provided under this project would include:  (a)
lining of selected distributaries and minors; (b) remodeling of moghas; and
(c) improvements to canal structures and lift facilities, as well as instal-
lation of other water control structures in order to meet water management
requirements. In the Warsak Lift subproject, non-project improvements are
planned for the pumping plant (para 2.04). The only additionaL water sup-
plies planned under the project in all subprojects are significant water
savings associated with planned project improvements to canals (para 3.08)
and watercourses (para 3.17). Also, planned improvements would lead to a
more assured water supply, afford greater equity to water users, and within
physical constraints of the system improve the t:imeliness of water deliveries
so as to better reflect crop water requirements.
3.08    The project would provide for lining certain sections of minor and
smaller distributaries to reduce current excessive seepage losses and to
improve water control. Generally, reaches of canals selected for lining
would be less than 30 cusecs capacity and would be dependent on: (a) seepage
losses in the canal (generally greater than 4 cusecs/million sq. ft. surface
area); (b) relationship of canal and watertable elevations; (c) quality of
groundwater with high priority given to SGW areas; and (d) value of water.
Moreover, in areas where high watertable is not a problem and groundwater
quality is good, an economic evaluation would be made of a balanced program



-14-
of canal lining and private TW installation to achieve a desirable conjunc-
tive surface/groundwater operating system. The length proposed for lining is
estimated as follows: Punjab-about 93 mi, Sind-73 mi, NWFP-10 mi, and
Baluchistan-12 mi. It is estimated that about 50,000 ac/ft of water would be
saved by this improvement. See Table 3.1 for lengths distributaries and
minors proposed for lining and estimated water savings.

3.09    Remodelling of moghas would be provided in all the subprojects to
improve water distribution and ensure equitable water deliveries to chaks,
especially to those in the tail-end reaches (p;.ra 2.06). About 1,325 outlets
would be remodeled, including about 665 in Punjab (Pakpattan 205, Shabkot 95,
6-R 280 and Niazbeg 85), 450 in Sind, 150 in NWFP, and 60 in Baluchistan.
Gating of outlets would be considered in cases where continuous watercourse
flows cause damage to crops, or where water management considerations
dictate.
3.10    The project would provide for remodeling of structures at the head-
works and silt erectors near the pump station for the Warsak Lift subproiect.
The lower reaches of the Niazbeg distributary (Punjab) would be remodeled,
and a low-lift pumping station would be installed to provide additional head
(about 5 ft) for better command of the service area. Other improvements
would involve replacement and repair of regulating structures in various
subprojects to facilitate better water control and water management.
Drainage (Estimated Base Cost--US$9.1 M)
3.11    The project would provide drainage TWs and disposal channels for SGW
areas in the Shahkot and 6-R Subprojects, civil works for surface drainage
has four subprojects, as well as required transport and surveying equipment,
investigations and surveys, and related recurring costs for this component.
3.12    Subsurface Drainage.  WAPDA determined in very recent field examina-
tions (November 1983) that some 36,000 ac in the upper portion of 6-R sub-
project and about 10,000 ac in the lower portion of Shahkot subproject
require immediate subsurface drainage. The project would provide for a grid
network of automated drainage TWs (about 60 in 6-R and 20 in Shahkot),
including electrical hookups. In addition, about 55 mi of lined channels
would be constructed to convey drainage effluent to the nearest surface drain
outlet. 6-R effluent would be carried to a desert evaporation pond. Effluent



-15-
from the Shahkot subproject would outlet into the Maduana drain and thence to
the Ravi River. Considering the aquifer characteristic, project TWs in
Shahkot subproject would be designed for 2.5 cusecs capacity with a well
depth of about 300 ft. These TWs would be equipped with electrical shaft
driven vertical turbine or electrical submersible pumps. However, TWs in the
6-R subproject would have design capacity of one cusec with a well depth of
about 150 ft. These TWs would be equipped with centrifugal (electric)
pumpset. In both subprojects, the overall efficiency of the pumps should
exceed 55%. The pumps, strainers, and casing should be resistance to corro-
sion from saline waters.
3.13    Recent investigations by WAPDA indicate that the groundwater tables
in 6-R and Shahkot are rising currently at the annual rate of about 0.9 and
0.4 feet respectively. If these upward rates continue, it would appear that
up to another 40,000 ac in each subproject may require drainage, under GOP's
definition of a disaster area, within the next 5 to 10 years. Also as indi-
cated in para 2.07, the Las Bela subproject appears to have an imminent
subsurface drainage problem-the timing of which would depend upon the time
and extent of development and the degree that a water management program is
implemented. Expenditures for these extended subsurface drainage programs
would likely come during the post project period. The project would provide
monitoring of groundwater in these three potentially critical subprojects.
3.14    Surface Drainage.  The project would provide funding for improving
the existing surface drainage system in the Shahkot, 6-R, Warsak Lift and Las
Bela subprojects, which according to WAPDA and PIDs most urgently require
such improvements. The surface drainage system would provide an outlet to:
(a) drain excess storm rain water in a timely manner; and (b) dispose of
effluent from the subsurface drainage system for 6-R and lower Shahkot.
Priority for surface drain construction would be given to the SGW areas in
6-R and Shahkot. The project would provide about US$5.9 M (base cost) for
the surface drainage program including funds to acquire about 800 ac of
required lands. It is estimated that this level of funding would provide
about 20% of that required for comple'ting the entire surface drainage system.
The remaining work would be carried out during the post project period.
On-Farm Water Management (Estimated Base Cost US$19.6 M)
3.15    The project would provide technical staff from the Provincial Depart-
ment of Agriculture OFWM Directorates and Extension Service to aid farmers in
the layout of: (a) watercourse renovation; (b) farm irrigation and surface
drainage ditches; Cc) precision land-leveling (about 20,000 ac targeted for
project area); and (d) demonstration plot (one ac plot planned per water-
course renovated). In addition, this Provincial staff would give guidance to
farmers on applying and scheduling irrigation water to their fields. OEWM
Directorates land-leveling equipment would be made accessible to the farmers
on a rental basis. The project would provide materials for watercourse
renovation, transport office and surveying equipment, administration and
engineering, and related recurring costs for this component.
3.16    Watercourse Renovation.   The project would provide for renovating
about 1,050 watercourses, consisting of 530 in Punjab, 360 in Sind, 100 in
NWF, and 60 in Baluchistan Provinces. Except for the percentage of
cement-brick lining, this activity is modeled after that in the OFWM Project



-16-
(Cr. 1163-PAK). The cement-brick lining in the OFWM Project was limited to
15% in the FGW areas and 30% in SGW, whereas in CWMP the percentage lining In
FGW would remain generally the same t15%) but would be increased to about 40%
in SGW areas, and to 50% in Las Bela because of the high infiltration rates
of the soils (para. 2.07). Increased lining in the SCW areas would provide
additional water savings, which would be made available for crop production,
and reduce the drainable surplus. It is estimated that about 4.75 M ft
(about 900 mi) of watercourses would receive cement-brick lininf. The
remaining earthen sections of the communal watercourses would 1-a rebuilt with
clean compacted soil. This earthen portion would be completed prior to
installing the cement-brick lined section in each watercourse to be
renovated. Permanent outlets (pucca nuccas) would be installed (about one
for each 10 ac) at junctions and author±zed outlets. Also, the project would
provide about four culverts per watercourse renovated as well as a limited
number of buffalo baths. It is assumed that about 80% of the watercourses in
the Punjab and Sind subprojects would be renovated under the project. About
67% of the watercourses in Warsak Lift and Las Bela would be renovated, which
reflects the sizeable areas under command in these subprojects that are not
now receiving irrigation service. See Table 3.2 for summary on watercourses
to be renovated, along with the percentages and lengths to be lined.
3.17    The estimated saving from watercourse renovation varies from about
15% of the surface and public TW water delivered to the watercourse head in
FGW areas where 15% cement-brick lining would be installed to over 25% in
6-R with 40% lining and about 30% 'n Las Bela with 50% lining. It is
estimated that about 236,000 ac/ft or a little more than 18% of the publicly
generated water would be saved in the seven subprojects when these improve-
ments are completed. See Table 3.2 for summary of estimated water savings by
subprojects.

3.18    The length of the sakari khal (communal watercourse) in the
Sehra-Naulakhi and Warsak Lift subproject is about twice that for the area
commanded, as compared with Punjab's subprojects (para. 2.06). An effort
would be made with WUAs in these two subprojects to strive for desirable
redesign of the watercourse and chaks to achieve higher efficiency in water-
course deliveries. Assurances have been obtained from GOP and GOProviuces



-17-
that the following criteria would be used by field teams in setting
priorities for watercourse renovation (i.e., the same as for OFWM Project,
Cr. 1163-PAK):
(a) establishment of formally organized and registered WUAs (required
prior to installing permanent structures); and
(b) willingness of water users to improve their own watercourse
branches and field ditches and install OFWM practices (i.e. land
levelling, improved field layout, etc.) on their individual farms.
Project Management (Base Cost US$8.6 M)
3.19    Organization for Management.  The management function for each sub-
project would be carried out by a Provincial Policy Committee, Subproject
Management Office, 1/ and Subproject Coordinating Committee. Implementation
of the canal remodelling, drainage and OFWM components would be by the line
agencies, i.e. Provincial Departments of Irrigation and OFWM Directorates in
the Provincial Departments of Agriculture. A vastly broadened program of
responsibilities and activities is envisioned for the WUAs (paras 5.07 and
5.08). Details on institutional arrangements are contained in paras
5.01-5.09. The project would provide facilities, transport, office, radio
and computer equipment, administration and engineering, and related recurrent
costs for this component.
3.20    Whereas the technical provisions and implementation actions required
for the canal remodeling, drainage, and OF4M components described in paras
3.04 to 3.18 are well understood and based on years of experience in
Pakistan, the Project Management for CWMP should be viewed as a pilot under-
taking. As indicated earlier (paras 1.08, 1.15, 2.18 and 3.02), a major
constraint to achieving reasonable increases in irrigated agricultural
production in Pakistan is the fragmented institutional arrangements which
have proven inefficient in delivering water and non-water inputs to farmers
on a timely and assured basis. CWMP management organization is structured to
overcome these deficiencies based on the authority exercised at the
Secretarial level of the Provincial Governments through the Provincial Policy
Committee and managed at the subproject office with participation of line
agencies and farmers through their WUAs. This organization's structure, with
specific day to day management by the subproject officer, would be respon-
sible for policy and program guidance and inter agency coordination.
3.21    Since the Project Management organization is a preliminary attempt to
facilitate efficient irrigated agriculture in Pakistan, a significant invest-
ment is being made in COMP in form of technical assistance, training,
monitoring and evaluation that would not be envisioned in replicated sub-
project areas. A major objective of this project (para. 3.03) is the
development of a Provincial capability, based on the experiences of this
proiect, that could be redeployed during the post proiect period to other
areas carrying out similar programs.
1/ In Punjab Provinces, one project office would handle the management
function for the four subprojects (para 5.03).



-18-
3.22    Staff Training.  Training activities would focus early in the Project
on (a) subproject managers and their staff; (b) participating line agency and
extension personnel to provide skills needed to strengthen the farmer's role
as a WUA member and provide farmers with information needed for effective
water management; and (c) WUA officials. Later training efforts would
prlmarily be in the form of In-service training and seminars conducted with
assistance from expatriate expert advisors (see paras 5.21-5.22).
3.23    Technical Assistance.  The project would provide nine full-time
expatriate advisors (about 21 man/years) In two separate teams (estimated
at US$15,000 per man/month). 1/ One team would be located in Karachi to
assist in the planning implementation, operations and maintenance of the Sind
and Baluchistan subprojects. The other team would be based in Lahore to
provide similar assistance to the Punjab and NWFP subprojects.
3.24    In addition, the project would provide about 73 man/years of local
supervisory consultants (estimated cost at about US$2,200 per man/month). I/
See para 5.23 for description of program of work for the supervisory consult-
ants.
IV. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING AND PROCUREMENT
Project Costs
4.01    Total project cost over the five-year period (July 1984-June 1989)
is estimated to be Rs 1,105 M (US$81.9 M) with a foreign exchange component
of about 6Z. Estimates are based on early 1984 prices and include about
US$1.2 M in taxes and duties, but exclude expected farmer labor contributions
for minors, watercourses and field channel rehabilitation (estlmated at about
US$4.2 M). The cost of each subproject has been based on detalled quantities
included in the feasibility report prepared by WAPDA and on the following
prevailing rates in each Province (a) earthwork, and masonry structures for
items related to: (a) rehabilitating and remodeling of canals and drains;
(b) tubewell Installation (Punjab only) In SCARP areas; and (c) OFWM works.
Given the nature of the project, however, a great deal of flexibllity in
investment planning and implementation is necessary to introduce changes as
identified in the annual work plan to be prepared for each subproject (para
5.10). Therefore, and because project components are highly divisible,
physical contingencies have been estimated only for subsurface drainage and
equipment. Price contingencies are 28Z of base costs according to the
estimated annual Inflation rates given in the footnote to Table 4.1.
1/ Includes all costs, i.e., personal services, fees, overhead, direct,
support staff etc.

Financing
4.02    The proposed IDA credit of about SDR 43.7 M (US$46.5 M) would finance
almost 58% of total project cost, net of taxes and duties. The United States
Agency for International Development (USAID) is expected to extend a grant of
about US$25.0 M which would finance an additional 31% of total project costs,
net of taxes and duties. Farmers cash contribution would amount to about
US$1.1 M relating to the remodelling of watercourses. In addition, farmers
labor contribution to the remodelling of watercourses would amount to about
US$4.5 M.
4.03    Anticipatory qpproval has been given the project by the Minister of
Finance, as Chairman of ECNEC. Condition of credit effectiveness would
require (a) final approval of the PC-Is by ECNEC; (b) evidence that suffi-
cient funds for the first project fiscal year (1984/85) had been provided in
the respective ADPs; and (c) meeting all conditions precedent to the effec-
tiveness of the USAID agreement.
4.04    IDA would finance:  investigations and surveys; civil works relating
to canal rehabilitation and remodeling, and drainage components; vehicles,
radio communications, survey equipment, and office equipment and furniture,
local experts, and incremental field and project management staff. USAID
would finance: OFWM civil works; water management equipment; and expatriate
experts. See Table 4.2 for details on financing plan by expenditure
category.

difficulties in financing certain expenditures for project development, a
Civil Work Imprest Account at the Federal level (within the State Bank of
Pakistan) and sub-accounts at the Provincial level were established under the
OFWM Project (Cr. 1163-PAK) and OFWM component of Drainage IV Project
(Cr. 1375-PAl). A similar system is provided in this project, with an
Imprest Account at Federal level and subaccounts at Provincial level, to
cover all IDA-financed civil works contracts. However, several modifications
in operation are provided as follows: (a) IDA, as requested by
GOP/GOProvinces, would deposit and maintain a level of rupees in the imprest
account and subaccounts for a subsequent four-month construction period; and
Cb) GOProvinces would submit periodic withdrawal applications, which would
record the utilization of the credit allowances (see Annex 4 for Procedures
for Operating Civil Works Imprest Accounts). Assurances have been obtained
from GOP and GOProvinces that operation of the imprest accounts would be
satisfactory to IDA and establishment of these accounts is a condition of
credit effectiveness.
Procurement
4.06    Civil works, equipment and technical assistance would be procured for
the project. Procurement outlined in paras 4.07 to 4.10 relates solely to
IDA financed related items. Procurement procedures are summarized in Table
4.3.
4.07    Civil Works.  Because project civil works associated with the project
would be small, subject to the seasonal construction periods, and scattered
over a wide area, international competitive bidding (ICB) would not be prac-
tical.  Civil works associated with the canal rehabilitation and remodelling,
and drainage components would be carried out by: (a) local competitive
bidding (LCB); and (b) force account through use of PIDs equipment, personr-
nel, and facilities. There is need to revise existing PIDs's tender documents
to make them satisfactory to IDA. LCB contracts exceeding US$200,000 would
be sent to IDA for prior review. Force account unit rates would be reviewed
with IDA.
4.08    Equipment.  Transport (including motorcycles), communication and TW
equipment would be procured through ICB in accordance with IDA guidelines.
The Ministry of Water and Power would coordinate the procurement of such
equipment. Total estimated cost for such ICB procured equipment is about



-21-
US$1.3 M. Because of the relatively small amount of office and survey equip-
ment required in the four Provinces, these items would be procured following
Provincial procedures satisfactory to IDA whereby the concerned agency would
compare the prices from at least three independent suppliers. The aggregate
amount of such LCB procured equipment would not exceed the aggregate of
US$0.3 M.
4.09    Supervisory Consultants.  Appointment of suitably qualified local
supervisory consultants (estimated total cost of about US$1.8 M) would be in
accordance with principles and procedures described in the Guidelines for the
Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing
Agency, as published by the Bank (August 1981).
4.10    Assurances have been obtained from GOP and GOProvinces that LCB
procedures utilized in procurement of civil works and equipment, and ICB
procedures for procurement of equipment would be satisfactory to IDA. In
addition, assurance has been obtained from GOP that appointment of super-
visory consultants would be on terms, conditions and schedule satisfactory to
IDA.

Disbursement
4.11    IDA credit would be disbursed for:
(a) 95% of the cost of investigations and surveys;
(b) 95% of the cost of civil works related to canal rehabilitation
and remodelling and drainage components;



-22-
(c) 100% of the cost of the supervisory consultants;
(d) 100% of foreign expenditures on directly imported, or 100X of
the ex-factory price of domestically manufactured vehicles,
radio communication, survey, and furniture equipment, and 55%
of local expenditures (off-the-shelf); and
(e) 60% of cost of OFWM field teams and subproject management staffs.
4.12    Disbursements for works undertaken by force account and for small
contracts costing less than Rs 300,000 under item (b) would be made against
statement of expenditures; disbursement under item (a) and (e) would be made
under statement of expenditures; supporting documents would be retained by
the implementing agencies, for review by IDA. Disbursements for item under
(b) carried out by contractors for contracts costing Rs 300,000 or more and
for items under (c) and (d) would be fully documented. Reimbursement
applications for LCB contracts under (b) to be funded through the imprest
accounts would be accompanied by a statement of transaction on the imprest
subaccounts since the previous application, with the balance certified by the
State Bank of Pakistan. Based on information from implementing agencies,
subproject managers assisted by supervisory consultants would be responsible
for the initial preparation of IDA reimbursement applications which would be
submitted to the Ministry of Water and Power, which in turn would forward the
reimbursement applications to IDA for reimbursement. Reimbursement applica-
tions for technical assistance would be prepared by the Ministry of Water and
Power and submitted to IDA for reimbursement. It is anticipated that the
final IDA disbursement for the project would be completed by March 30, 1990,
about nine months after proiect completion. The disbursement schedule is
based on the disbursement profile of the On-Farm Water Management (Cr.
1163-PAK) project, which is the most comparable project with implementation
experience in Pakistan. Disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 1, Table 13.
Accounts and Audits
4.14    Implementing agencies would maintain separate project accounts and
subproject managers assisted by supervisory consultants would make internal
reviews and consolidate these accounts before submitting them to the Ministry
of Water and Power. The Ministry, assisted by supervisory consultants, would
consolidate the accounts of all the subproiects after which they would be
audited by independent accountants and submitted to IDA. The Audit Report
would include inter alia, a statement verifying that funds advanced by IDA to
the Imprest Account and disbursed against statement expenditure had been used
for the purpose for which they were provided. Assurances have been obtained
from GOP that (a) all implementing agencies would prepare and maintain
separate project accounts, (b) subproject managers and the Ministry would
prepare and maintain consolidated project accounts at the subproject and
national level respectively, (c) project account would be audited annually by
an independent auditor satisfactory to IDA, (d) copies of the unaudited
annual project account would be sent to IDA for review no later than six
months after the end of each fiscal year and copy of the auditor's report not
later than nine months after the end of each fiscal year, and (e) the
auditor's report would include, inter alia, a statement that the use of the
funds advanced by IDA for the imprest account and against statement of expen-
diture had been used for the purpose for which they were provided.

V. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
5.01    The Provincial governments, through line agencies in the Departments
of Irrigation and Agricultural, would be responsible for implementation and
operation of subprojects in their jurisdiction. For this project, the coor-
dination and implementation programs of these departments would be
strengthened with the establishment of a Provincial Policy Coordination
Committees 1/ (para. 5.02) and Offices of Subproject Management (para. 5.03).
Establishing these Provincial Policy Committees and Subproject Management
Offices are conditions of credit effectiveness. In addition, the Federal
Ministry of Water and Power would be responsible for inter-Provincial coor-
dination. (See Plate II--Project Organizational Chart).
Provincial Policy Committee
5.02    Provincial governments would  establish a Provincial Policy Commit-
tee, which would be chaired by the Additional Chief Secretary, Planning and
Development (P&D) Department. The Secretaries of Agriculture, Irrigation,
and Finance would be members of the Committee.  The major responsibilities of
the Provincial Policy Committees are: (a) formulating policies aimed to
realize full subproject benefits in the shortest possible time; (b) coor-
dinating participating agency input at the Provincial level and oversight at
the subproject level; (c) review/revise as appropriate, and adopt subproject
annual work plan (para 5.10); (d) program Provincial agencies resources in
line with adopted annual work plan; and (e) periodically review (at least
quarterly) the subproject status, progress in meeting target and agreements
and take required action to overcome deficiencies.
Subproject Management Offices
5.03    Since project management is viewed as a pilot undertaking (para
3.18), several approaches are envisaged at the subproject level. These
variations are designed to reflect Proviacial considerations and to gain
additional experience which could be useful for subsequent replicated
projects. However, unless stated otherwise, reference in this report to
subproject management offices and subproject managers shall include all such
variations. Punjab is the only Province with more than one subproject.
Hence in an effort to strengthen management and achieve greater efficiency in
personnel utilization, Punjab will establish one project office in Lahore to
carry out the management function for all four subprojects. This office will
be headed by a high level project director with required support staff. It
will be administratively assigned to the Provincial Department of Agricul-
ture, but will be responsible to and serve as secretariat for Punjab's
Provincial Policy Committee. In NWFP, Sind, and Baluchistan, the subproject
management offices would be located in the subproject and would be headed by
1/ Punjab's Provincial Coordination Committee established for the Fourth
Drainage Project (Cr. 1375-PAl) could serve the same role for CWMP.



-24-
a subproiect manager. Sind Province will have a small cell (two profession-
als) located in Karachi. It will be assigned to Sind's P&D and will serve a
coordinating and facilitating function. The subproject managers would be
responsible to the respective Provincial Policy Committee and would report
administratively to its chairman. A primary function of the subproject
managerc; would be to transform general policy goals specified by the Policy
Committee into specific objectives, defined as desired subproject area out-
puts at specific times, places, quantities and qualities. The second major
management function would be to plan, prioritize and schedule program ele-
ments which are expected to produce the output package specified in the
objectives. The monitoring and evaluation program (paras 5.14 to 5.18)
designed for each subproject would provide continuous information about how
well the project elements are doing. This information is essential to the
subproject manager and participation agency personnel so that they may adjust
program inputs, or "fine tune" the project efforts over time, by scheduling
delivery of water and non-water inputs in the most appropriate manner. In
addition to the management function listed above, the subproject management
offices would have the following specific responsibilities: (a) preparing
annual work plan for subproiect (para. 5.10) and gain adoption by Subproject
Coordinating Committee and Provincial Policy Committee; (b) prepare quarterly
and annual progress report; (c) prepare reimbursement applications from input
of line agencies with assistance of supervisory consultants; (d) develop
training program for suproject; and (e) carry out the water management unit's
function. The subproject management office would have two major operating
entities, i.e., Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Unit and Water Management
Unit.
5.04    Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Unit.  Principal staff respon-
sibility for the planning program and monitoring and evaluation would be
assigned to this unit. Continuous monitoring and evaluation would be carried
out by the unit with input and assistance of the participating agencies. See
paras. 5.14 to 5.18 for details on monitoring and evaluating program.
5.05    Water Management Unit.  A water management unit would be established
in each subproject management office to: Ca) collect and analyze data; (b)
analyze system distribution capabilities; (c) determine crop water require-
ments; and (d) aid farmers and irrigation officials in better matching crop-
ping systems and irrigation supplies. Functions of this unit would focus
on the following areas:
(a) improved scheduling of surface supplies within the physical
constraints of the system;
(b) timely and conjunctive use of TWs in FGW to better meet crop
water requirements, which would increase substantially the
marginal value of water;
(c) appropriate utilization of additional water resulting from
savings (estimated to be about 285,000 ac/ft annually from
project works) and further exploitation of FGW areas;
(d) improved reliability and certainty in water deliveries to
farmers;



-25-
(e) equitable distribution of water supplies to all farmers; and
(f) initiate pilot "warimetric" system (para 6.16).
The water management units will be provided with equipment including a small
computer, agro-climatic data station, flow measurement equipment, and soil
moisture measurenent equipment for each subproject.  Also, the project would
provide limited range radio communication equipment. Communications is
essential in providing for reliable coordination in distribution of irriga-
tion water supplies and collection of various agriculture data related to
QJMP. Where needed by the PIDs, and OFWM Directorates, the project would
provide for two-way radio sets for voice communications among field offices,
critical irrigation sites, and to a limited number of field staff. Except
for Punjab, the base stations for the communication equipment would be
located at the project management offices, whereas in Punjab, the base sta-
tion would be located in the subproject area.
Subproject Program Coordinating Committees
5.06    Each subproiect would have a Program Coordinating Committee, chaired
by the subproject manager. Membership would include representatives of the
Provincial Irrigation and Agriculture Departments, suppliers of non-water
inputs and credit, and representatives of local water user associations
MWUAs). Delivery of the total mix of water ansd non-water agricultural inputs
would necessarily emanate from the membership of the Committee, but such
delivery would be facilitated by the local Extension Agents who form the
connecting link between farmers and the various government and private sector
input suppliers. The timing of delivery, however, is most directly impacted
on the interaction between the subproject manager and the various members of
the subproject Program Coordinating Committee.
Water Users Associations (WUAs)
5.07    As a condition for receiving project assistance, WUAs would be estab-
lished for each chak and registered in the OFWM Directorate office in each
Province (paras 3.18).  In addition, informal federations 1/ of WUAs would be
formed to facilitate implementation of projects works at the minor and dis-
tributary canal levels. Initial efforts would focus on their providing labor
and cash cost-sharing for the OFWM component with a phased program to
increase their participation in the canal rehabilitation and remodelling
component and surface drainage subcomponent. To ensure adequate farmer
participation in civil works development decisions, line agencies (e.g.,
Provincial Irrigation Departments (PIDs) or On-Farm Water Management (OFM)
Directorates would seek the guidance of WUAs as to needed improvements and
obtain their concurrence prior to formulating detailed plans. OFWM Direc-
torate personnel would deal with a single WUA, whereas PIDs would normally
deal with a federation of WUAs. Over time, such farmer groups would be the
1/ In Sind and Baluchistan these are designated as distributory and canal
organizations of WUAs, whereas in Punjab and NWFP they will be called
together for consultation by the subproject manager.



-26-
primary contact point for extension workers to provide information on irriga-
tion and other matters, and to demonstrate how farmers in each Association
can work jointly to avail themselves of credit and other non-water input
deliveries through developing a larger group "demand" to attract suppliers.
Ultimately they could offer their produce to the market in like manner.
5.08    Each subproject would have a WUA organization made up of repre-
sentation from all WUAs. This organization would meet at least quarterly
with the subproject manager to ensure efficient implementation and operation
of subproject programs. Local extension agents, OFWM Directorate and PID
officials may meet with the council as ex-officio members. Assurances have
been obtained from GOP and GOProvinces during negotiations that formal WUAs
would be organized on individual chaks as a condition for farmers receiving
assistance under the OWFM component and WUAs would be consulted prior to and
during remodeling of canals.
Ministry of Water and Power
5.09    The Ministry of Water and Power would be responsible for consolidated
procurement of ICB equipment based upoa recommendations of GOProvinces and
coordinating: (a) inter Provincial matters; (b) appointment of local and
expatriate experts; (c) submission of disbursement application; (d) prepara-
tion of consolidated quarterly and annual progress report for project and
submit to GOProvinces, GOP, USAID and IDA within three months of end of
reporting period; (e) preparation of Project Completion Report and submit to
GOP, GOProvinces, USAID and IDA within six months of closing date for
project; (f) overseas training program based upon recommendations of
GOProvinces; and (g) preparation of the overall monitoring and evaluation
program for the project (para 5.14). The Ministry's staff would be supple-
mented by adding a Project Coordinator, assistant accountant, and support
staff, along with required equipment and related operating expenses.
Organizational Procedures for Implementing Civil Works
5.10    The purpose of project civil works is to remove physical constraints
to effective water management in subproject areas. To accomplish this, the
subproject management offices would be responsible for ensuring that priority
civil works are planned and implemented in a coordinated fashion. The proce-
dure outlined below would ensure effective budgetary control and flexibility
for implementation of priority activities in each subproject:
(a)  An annual work plan would be prepared by the subproject managers
by consolidating and coordinating the plans of the line agencies
within subproject areas. This would include the rationale for
proposed works; description of relationships between schemes;
description of prior planning efforts, including the role of
farmers, etc.; and economic justification. The subproject's
annual work plan would be reviewed by the appropriate Subproject
Program Coordination Committee and then processed through steps
(b) and (c) below. If consensus of the Committee cannot be
reached, differing views awould be attached to document.



-27-
(b) Assurances have been obtained from GOP and GOProvinces that
the annual work plan would be submitted to IDA and USAID for
comments by March 31 of each year for the following year's
program.
(c) The annual work plan for each subproject would be presented
to the Provincial Policy Committee for the consideration and
adoption of its members in developing the Provincial ADP.
(d) The subpro4ect manager would review conceptual scheme designs
proposed by line agencies to ensure conformance to the adopted
annual work plan.
(e) Coordination between various line agencies and WUAs during
construction and operation would be monitored by the subproject
management office.
To facilitate planning of civil works, water management activities, and input
utilization and output realization, the subproject elements would be imple-
mented by focusing on localized areas during specific time periods.
Operation aud Maintenance
5.11    Canal Rehabilitation and Remodeling, and Drainage Components.  O&M
responsibilities for installed project works for these components would be
vested in the respective PIDs. Assurances have been obtained from GOProvin-
ces that sufficient funding would be provided to the PID to ensure adequate
O&M of project related irrigation and drainage works. It is estimated that
the following annual levels of O&M funding would be required in FY89: Punjab
- Rs 3,890,000 (of which Rs 2,100,000 for drainage TWs); Sind - Rs 165,000,
NWFP - Rs 135,000; and Baluchistan - Rs 70,000.
5.12    OFWM Component (Civil Works).   WUAs would be responsible for the
O&M of renovated watercourses. Sanctions are provided in Provincial WUA
Ordinances to ensure maintenance of these facilities. In case of
non-compliance with the maintenance requirements, such maintenance would be
undertaken by either the WUA and/or OFEM Directorate and the costs assessed
by the Provincial Department of Revenue against the non-complying farmer(s)
in the form of land arrears.
5.13    Facilities, Vehicle and Equipment Repairs and Service.  O&M of
facilities, transport and other equipment would be the responsibility of the
Department to which such items provided by the project are assigned.
Monitoring and Evaluation
5.14    There would be two types of monitoring:  (a) project input, which
would monitor activities such as civil works, procurement, staff recruitment,
and implementation of crop development programs; and (b) project output,
which would monitor increased services and production. Assurance has been
obtained from GOP during negotiations that the Ministry, in cooperation with
Provincial officials and with assistance of expatriate experts, would prepare
an overall monitoring and evaluation program for the project and submit it to
USAID and IDA for comment by March 31, 1985.



-28-
5.15    Input Monitoring.  CW.P and its subproject components must demon-
strate accountability. This requires monitoring of inputs (physical and
financial). Such project monitoring would be the responsibility of the
subproject management office with input from the appropriate participating
agencies. For project inputs monitoring, each implementing agency would
submit quarterly and annual reports to the subproject managers (paras 5.04
and 5.10). Such reports would indicate both financial and physical progress
toward annual plan targets. Report formats would be uniform for aggregation
at the subproject level by the subproject management office and at the
project level by the Ministry.
5.16    Output Monitoring.  Project performance is essential to achievemoent
of project objectives. This performance would be measured in terms of out-
puts resulting from total project efforts to provide more timely, reliable,
and sufficient supplies of water and non-water agricultural inputs. Such
monitored outputs could be changes in water deliveries, cropping intensities,
crop yields, net farm incomes and improved social well-being. For project
outputs monitoring the subproject managers would report at least annually to
the Subproject Program Coordinating Committee and Provincial Policy Committee
on a set of selected indicators which would measure progress toward specific
objectives. Indicators to be used and report format would be developed in
conjunction with institutions such as the Punjab Economic Research Institute
and the social scientists on the expatriate technical assistance team.
5.17    Evaluation.  Continuous evaluation would be under the aegis of the
subproject management office in cooperation with participating agencies. In
the case of Punjab and Sind Provinces, personnel from the evaluation and
regional planning cells in Planning and Development Departments would be
assigned major evaluation responsibilities. This evaluation function
provides the key to continued performance improvement in the subproject areas
and the degree to which results are used to make adjustments in the delivery
of water and non-water inputs. The Provincial Policy Committees would also
evaluate the program periodically.
5.18    Assurance has been obtained from GOP that an intermediate overall
project evaluation would be carried out by a suitable, independent institu-
tion acceptable to IDA and USAID, 18 months after initiation of the CWM
Project.
Staff Training
5.19    Three short-term training activities important to initiating project
implementation are as follows:
(a)  A three week training course sponsored by the Ministry would
be held in Islamabad to provide project management training and
orientation for administrative staff in each of the seven sub-
project offices, the course would include the following subject
matter components: (i) general organizational and management;
(ii) program budgeting and scheduling; (iii) coordination;
(iv) personnel mansgement; and (v) general orientation to a
command area apprcach to irrigation management.



-29-
(b) Project orientation workshops of one week duration would be held
in each of the seven subproject management offices for officials
of participating agencies. It would be scheduled upon completion
of the three-week training course for project administrative
staff. The workshops would be directed by each subproject manager.
(c) Early in the life of the project, all extension personnel working
in or to be assigned to the seven subproiect areas would be given
a six-week training course in irrigation water management. These
classes would likely be held at the Training Institute in Lahore.
Lahore. The instruction would cover: (i) extension methods;
(ii) extension organization development and participation (iii)
irrigation water management and scheduling; (iv) agronomic
practices and cropping patterns; and (v) farm management. All
such training would be completed within the first year of the
project.
5.20    In addition to the three formalized training activities outlined
above, other in-service training activities would be scheduled throughout the
project period. For example, one such training activity needed early in the
life of the project is a workshop for the computer programmers to be assigned
to the subprojects so that they can incorporate needed water scheduling and
socio-economic data evaluation routines and software for their respective
subproject offices. Also specialized training would be scheduled for WUA
officials. It is envisioned that members of the expatriate team would make a
major contribution to these training activities.
Technical Assistance
5.21    Expatriate Consultants.  This technical assistance would consist of
two inter-disciplinary teams, one to be headquartered in Lahore to service
subproject management offices in Punjab and NWFP, and the other to be head-
quartered in Karachi to service subproiects in Sind and Baluchistan. The
team leader would oversee both field teams and be headquartered in Lahore.
About nine months after teams arrival in Pakistan, GOP, USAID, and IDA would
undertake a review of the expatriate expert program to determine if any
mid-course redirection is appropriate. Terms of reference for the expatriate
consultants are included in Annex5. The expatriate teams provided by USAID
for the proiect would involve about 252 man/months of service as follows:
Profession                          No.                Man/Months
Team Leader/Farm Mgt. Spec.           1                    36

Total                       9                    252
5.22    USAID would provide also additional technical assistance in support
of CWNP that is not be reflected in the project budget. This would include
assistance in the planning and design of the currently undeveloped irrigation



-30-
facilities in the Las Bela subproject, assistance in design of other civil
works when needed, and strengthening of planning and management capabilities.
This assistance would be provided through ongoing long-term technical assis-
tance contracts under the USAID Irrigation Systems Management and On-Farm
Water Management Projects.
5.23    Supervisory Consultants.   The project would provide about 877
man/months of local supervisory consultants plus supporting staff as follows:

The teams' Manager would be located in Islamabad or Lahore, whereas the
remaining professionals shall be divided somewhat equally into two teams.
One team would be stationed at Lahore and have duties related to the Punjab
and NWFP subprojects. The second team would be located in Karachi or
Hyderabad and be assigned to the Sind and Baluchistan subproiects.  The
supervisory consultants would be responsible to the subproject managers,
however, they would report to the Proiect Coordinator in the Ministry. The
team's maior responsibility would be to give direct assistance to the sub-
project managers in carrying out their responsibilities. Terms of Reference
of the supervisory consultants are included in Annex 5. Services to be
performed by these consultants include: (a) review plans and designs for
civil works to assure compliance with agreed criteria on specifications; (b)
spot check civil works during construction and check all completed works to
determine quantity of work completed and if quality meets PID specifications;
Cc) assist subproject managers and ministry in preparation of: (i) IDA
reimbursement applications; (ii) consolidated Quarterly and Annual Progress
Reports and Project Completion Report; and (iii) consolidated Annual Project
Work Plan.
Project Implementation Schedule
5.24    Project implementation would be scheduled over five years, FY85-89,
(see Annex 2 for Implementation Schedule). During the first year major
project activities would be: (a) establishing and training the project
management staff; (b) organizing WUAs and initiating the implementation of
the OFWM component; (c) procurement of equipment; (d) appointment of consult-
ants; and (e) preparation of plans and designs for the annual remodeling and
drainage components. Construction of civil works for the canal rehabilita-
tion and remodeling component and surface drainage subcomponent would be
initiated in the second year and would continue throughout the project
period.  Civi' works related to the subsurface drainage component would be
started in the third year. This schedule provides WAPDA and Punjab's PID
opportunity to fully coordinate the installation of subsurface works in the



-31-
6-R subproject with that being planned for the remainder of the
Fordwah-Sadiqia drainage area.
VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETING, PRICING, FARM INCOME AND COST RECOVERY
Agricultural Impact
6.01    General.  The intensified improvements adopted in each subproject
area would have a significant impact on crop production and farmers' income.
The boosted crop production at the project full development would be
attributed mainly to the increases in cropping intensities and yields. All
these increases would be enhanced by: (a) irrigation improvemants including
reliable scheduled deliveries, increased supply by reduction of water losses,
and equitable distribution between head and tail reaches; (b) elimination of
waterlogged condition and reduction of crop losses suffered from rain flood-
ing through improved drainage; (c) strengthened extension service and
delivery of non-water inputs; and (d) encouragement of farmers' participation
and improved institutional arrangement in prolect management.
6.02    Cropping Intensity.  Table 6.1 summarizes the annual cropping inten-
sities under present (P), future without project (W) and future with project
(W) conditions for the seven subproject areas. At present, the highest
intensity 170Z for Niazbeg is dominated by fodder crops due to its adjacency
to Lahore where a high demand for green fodder persists year round, Las Bela
has the lowest, 15% where irrigaticn was initiated through the completion of
Hub Dam and Bela Canal in early 1983.  The decreased intensities for Shahkot
and 6-R under future without project condition assumed that more land area
would become economically unproductive through a worsened waterlogging condi-
tion. The proposed intensity increases under future with project condition
are mainly based on the supply of additional irrigation water saved from
pre-project losses and the adoption of better water management practices. It
Is assumed that farmers would use about 70% of the saved water to expand
planting acreage and about 30% for yield Increasing practices (see Annex 6,
Table 2).

6.03    Cropping Pattern.  Changes in cropping pattern in each subproject
area are expected. The major trends for the change are: (a) water-consuming
crops such as rice and sugarcane would have the least increase; (b) cotton



-32-
acreage would increase in the range of 12-22% in areas where the environment
Is more suitable for its cultivation such as Pakpattan, 6-R and
Sehra-Naulakhi; (c) except for Las Bela, wheat, maize and other cereal crops
generally would have an increase of 10-30Z; (d) fodder crops would stlll
dominate in Niazbeg; and (e) fodder and vegetables would expand substantially
in Las Bela to meet the increasing demand by the closely located city of
Karachi.
6.04    Crop Yield and Production.  Major crops yield would be enhanced by
the integrated improvements in both water and non-water inputs. The assumed
yield increase for major crops in the seven subproject areas are: wheat
(35-50Z); rice (35-40%); cotton (30-40%); maize (30-35%); fodder (30-50%),
and sugarcane (25-35%). See Annex 6, Table 1 for more details on yields and
intensities. A combination of increased yield and cropping Intensity would
result in a substantially incremental production. An illustrative incremen-
tal crop production in the whole project area is summarized in Table 6.2.

Marketing and Pricing
6.05    Pakistan's marketing arrangements vary by commodity, and to a lesser
extent by Province. In general, subprojects are located close to relatively
sizeable towns where marketing and milling facilities are considered adequate
to handle the project's expected incremental inputs and outputs. Under the
Gover,ment's expansion program the existing foodgrain storage capacity is
being increased. In addition, it is expected that Water Users Assvciations
would, wherever required, initiate investments in this type of activity on
behalf of their farmers.
6.06   Currently, about 60% of Pakistan's wheat production is for on-farm
consumption. The remaining 40% is sold (directly or through middle.*en) to
Government procurement centers and private wholesalers/millers. Government
procured wheat is sold at the official price to authorized mllls fo- flour
sale through the subsidized ratlon system. To stabilize market prices
between harvests, the Government sells wheat to private mills at lower than
free market prices witb the condition that they sell flour at an agreed
price. To reduce regional disparities in open market prices arising from
local shortages, restrictions on the transportation of wheat between provin-
ces have been removed. Following two good harvests in FY81 and FY82,
Pakilstan has achieved self-sufficiency in wheat, and for the first time a
token 50,000 tons were exported. Based on the Sixth Five-Year Plan target of



-33-
a daily per capita consumption of 340 g of wheat, and the estimated popula-
tion growth rate, wheat consumption requirements would increase from 10.8
million tons in FY82 to about 12.7 million tons by FY88. Therefore project
increased production would find a ready market.
6.07    Currently, about 25-40% of the total cane production is sold to sugar
mills, while the balance, net of seed and chewing requirements, is absorbed
by cottage industries. Farmers within authorized mill zones were obliged by
law to sell 85% of their cane to sugar mills. However, following a nearly
30% increase in procurement prices in FY81, and depressed international
prices, large domestic stocks of sugar have formed *n Pakistan. Therefore,
in a manor policy change the Government announced the decontrol and deration-
ing of sugar on August 1, 1983. Unlimited quantities of sugar can now be
sold by the private sector, with the Government's role limited to maintaining
a reserve stock of about 200 thousand tons to maintain stable prices and to
supply "fair price shops" in Baluchistan and other remote areas. The retail
price of government sugar has been maintained at Rs 7.75 per kg., while the
internal open market price, which is unregulated, is about Rs 8.50 kg. While
export prospects are not bright due to low international prices and high cost
of production in Pakistan, incremental production is expected to be absorbed
by the increased domestic demand. Based on GOP target of a per capita
availability of 21 kg of unrefined and 11.5 kg of refined sugar per year,
cane production requirements would rise from 36.6 million tons in FY82 to
about 38 million tons in FY88.
6.08    Approximately 40-50% of Pakistan's paddy production is consumed on
farm, whereas about 85% of the marketable surplus, mainly Basmati quality,
is exported through the State-owned Rice Export Corporation of Pakistan.
Producers sell most of their paddy to husking mills, which are primarily
privately operated. Cotton is sold either directly or through an inter-
mediary to ginneries _ind mills. Ginned cotton is partly consumed domesti-
cally, with the remainder being exported by the Pakistan Export Corporation.
Due to weever infestation in year 1983, Pakistan is now importing some
cotton. Other project outputs would be absorbed through farm family consump-
tion and local and domestic urban markets. With anticipated increases in
real income, unexported project induced production should be absorbed readily
by the domestic market.
6.09    Most agricultural prices in Pakistan are influenced by GOP interven-
tion through import/export controls, taxes, consumer/producer subsidies and
fixed procurement prices, although such intervention is being substantially
reduced. In the spring of 1980, GOP announced a reorientation of its
agricultural price policies. These policies are a-med to reduce input sub-
sidies, to provide adequate incentives to producers through appropriate
output price adjustments and to transfer responsibility from the public to
the private sector for appropriate marketing arrangements. To ensure ade-
quate incentives to farmers and to counter the effects of increasing input
costs arising from the reduction and eventual removal of input subsidies, GOr
is, with the advice of the Agricultural Price Commission, making continuous
increases in the procurement or support prices of major crops. For kharif
1983, the price of Basmati and IRRI-6 (milled) rice has been increased by
2.3% and 3.8% respectively and that of seed cotton by 1.5%. Procurement
prices for the rabi 1983/84 wheat crop have yet to be announced. However,
the domestic price in FY83 was estimated to be quite close to the export



-34-
parity price; given the stagnation in international prices, no large increase
in such price is expected. To improve the marketing operations for input
distribution, GOP started a process of privatization and a gradual removal of
all input subsidies. To that effect prices of nitrogenous fertilizer were
increased by 15% in October 1982 and by a further 10% in June 1983. Despite
such increases, and after the setback due to the initial large increase in
1980, fertilizer offtake has regained its upward trend while distribution is
now largely done by the private sector. The distribution of pesticides is
entirely in the hands of the private sector in Punjab and Sind, and efforts
in this direction are being vigorously pursued in Baluchistan and NWFP. As a
result, subsidies for plant protection have been largely eliminated and while
some increases in pesticide prices have occurred, more efficient distribution
and increased coverage have been achieved.
6.10    The prices used for the project's financial analysis are summarized
in Annex 6, Table 3. They are expressed in early 1984 currency values and
are mainly based on the latest GOP procurement and support prices, informa-
tion provided by the Provincial Departments of Agriculture, information
compiled by IDA's latest economic mission, and the mission findings from
field visits.
Farm Models and Farm Incomes
6.11    The impact of improvements to be financed under the project would
vary by subproject and within subprojects depending upon: location with
respect to siting along distributaries, minors, and watercourses;
availability of agricultural inputs and services; quality and depth of
groundwater; and farm size and land tenure. Seven illustrative farm models
have been prepared to assess the financial benefits of the investments
proposed under the subprojects. Each farm model was selected to be repre-
sentative of each subproiect and was estimated based on present average farm
size, family size, typical cropping pattern, cultivation practices, input
usages and yields. The analysis was done by estimating the benefits of
savings in water losses resulting from canal and watercourse renovation and
taking into account all other investments proposed in each subproject, e.g.,
canal remodeling, surface and subsurface drainage, and improvements in serv-
ices and input distribution. Farm models are based on the agricultural
assumptions described in paras. 6.01 to 6.04. Based on the above assump-
tions, the returns expected to accrue to project benefited farmers are sum-
marized in Table 6.3.

6.12    In general, the farm models assume that farmers would repay about
20-25Z of the cost of materials for watercourse improvements in 10
semi-annual installments and that incremental O&X on renovated watercourses
would average about Rs 22/ac. Under such conditions, incremental net farm
income would tend to be moderate during the first five years of the project
and substantially thereafter. Incremental net farm income would range from
19% in Pakpattan to over 100% in Las Bela, with higher increases accruing to
farmers in areas where current cropping intensities are still low and a
substantial portion of the farmer family income is currently derived from
off-farm employment. Benefits accrued to farmers located at the tail of
minors and watercourses would generally be greater than those accrued to head
farmers. The above models illustrate the returns expected to accrue to
owner/operators. Project impact on tenants' income would vary depending on
tenancy arrangements but would generally range from one-half to two-thirds of
incremental benefits estimated to accrue to owner/operators. These increases
in income are considered to be adequate to induce farmers to contribute labor
to proiect works mainly to renovate and maintain watercourses and to remodel
and line minor canals. Detailed farm models are shown in Annex 6, Tables 4
to 10.
06M, Water Charges and Cost Recovery
6.13    O&M. While historically all improvements to the system, and more
recently a portion of OM costs, have been financed by GOP, inadequacy of OM
funds during the 70s caused a serious deterioration of the entire system.
Recognizing the need to prevent further deterioration of the canal system
O&M expenditures have increased significantly in the 1980's and today
generally meet or exceed the agreed 06K target established in ISRP
(Cr. 1239-PAK) (para 1.12). During negotiations, a working draft (April
1984) of the report, Funding Requirements for Adequate System Operation and
Maintenance - Pakistan as prepared by USAID consultants (para 1.12) was
presented to GOP, GOProvinces and IDA. GOP and GOProvinces agreed to send
their comments to IDA on this draft report so that followup discussions could
be held with IDA by June 30, 1984. Assurances were obtained from GOP and



-36-
GOProvinces that the Provinces would review annually the level of funds
required for O&M of the irrigation, surface dral-age and flood control
facilities and furnish to IDA such levels of funding, for review and comment,
not later than February 1 of each year for the following fiscal year.
6.14    Water Charges.  To provide adequate revenue for the proper main-
tenance of the system, it is the Government's objective to recover, as a
minimum, the entire O&M expenditures through water charges. Also, under
existing IDA assisted projects, Provinces are required to increase water
charges at intervals of not more than two years or make other financial
arrangements to achieve full cost recovery of O&M expenditures by the four
Provinces by FY92 or earlier (see para 1.13). Thus far, GOP and GOProvinces
are generally meeting the provisions of the above-mentioned covenants,
although during 1983 water charges accounted for only about 60% of O&M expen-
ditures. Through the period FY79-82, all Provinces increased water charges
by about 95%. Sind and Baluchistan further increased water charges in FY83
and Sind introduced a new drainage cess in FY84. Water charges were not
increased in FY84 primarily because of the introduction of Ushr, an Islamic
levy to be used by local authorities to benefit the needy. GOP and GOProvin-
cial officials take the position that since (a) the Ushr levy is assessed on
agricultural production, and (b) additional revenues generated (estimated at
about US$35.0 X through the 1983/84 rabi crop) would permit substitution of
revenues for O&M of the irrigation system, that this levy qualifies as "other
financlal arrangements" under the existing IDA agreements. Assurances have
been obtained from GOP and GOProvinces, that the Province would increase
water charges periodically, or make other financial arrangements, to cover an
increasing percentage of the cost of O&M of the irrigation facilities so that
by July 1, 1988 in Sind, July 1, 1990 in Punjab, July 1, 1991 in NWFP, and
July 1, 1992 in Baluchistan, the full cost of such O&M is recovered. Pur-
suant to this assurance, an understanding was reached with GOP and GOProvin-
ces that a 25% increase in water charges, or other appropriate financial
arrangements would be required by FY86.
6.15    Currently, water charges represent only about 6% of the per acre
income of crops (see Annex 6, Tables 4 to 10). Though rates vary substan-
tially among crops, this variation has little relationship to the consumptive
crop water requirements. The present water charges system tends to penalize
efficient water use by farmers and reinforces pressures to keep them low
because water charges levied on individual farmers have no direct relation-
ship to the amount of water actually delivered to him during any particular
season. Moreover, under current operating conditions, there is little
flexibility in adjusting irrigation water supplies to meet crop water
requirements. Water supplies through the entire system fluctuate in response
to variation in river flows and are subject to extreme curtailment or cut-off
of services when there is a canal breach due to poor maintenance or there is
a need for closing for annual emergency repairs. In such circumstances,
water rates have serious limitations as instruments for optimizing water
utilization. However, the investments under this project, and to some extent
those under the IRSP, should significantly reduce a nuAber of inefficiencies
in all irrigation subsystems.
6.16    To help remove the inequities of the current water charges system,
experimentation with a volumetric water charge system would be introduced
in a pilot area under the project. The proposed volumetric system (termed



-37-
hereafter as "warimetric" system) would be based on the fact that under the
warabandi rotation, each farmer receives water for a specified period of time
at a designated flow rate during each turn for water. Under the proposed
warimetric system each farmer would pay for water according to the length of
time he actually receives water, or more simply, according to the number of
irrigations he receives. Water rates would aim at full recovery of O&M
expenditures from beneficiaries. Because each irrigation is for a fixed time
and flow, this amounts to payment according to volume of water. This
warimetric system would be possible in subproject areas, since envisaged
improvements would result in a direct relationship between time of delivery
and volume of delivery for all farmers. Distributaries and minors serving
the subproject areas would be modernized under the project and they would be
operated with strengthened management which would help to ensure adequate
control and monitoring of irrigation supplies. Increased farmer involvement
would also facilitate introduction of a warimetric system. Based on the
existing warabandi groups or shareholder committees, WUAs would be formed to
participate more directly in local irrigation management matters; WUAs could,
for example, monitor and report canal flows at their watercourse outlet which
is essential for equitable operation of the warimetric system, maintain
direct reporting links to PID staffs on behalf of their members, and register
water deliveries to their members to be used in determining and/or
crosschecking the warimetric water charges. Detailed work plans for water
distribution and water charges made internally in a WUA(s) could be included
in the annual work plans to be prepared by the subproject managers. The Las
Bela subproject is one subarea where this system could be initiated. Also,
the conjunctive surface/groundwater subproiects (Shahkot and Sehra-Naulakhi)
would be other suitable areas to initiate the proposed warimetric system.
6.17    In line with the OF", Project (Cr. 1163-PAK), farmers under the
proiect would contribute all unskilled labor or about 25% of the total cost
of watercourse renovation. In addition, under the OFWM Project, farmers in
Punjab and Sind repay a portion of the cost of materials (20% and 25% respec-
tively, without interest) over five years. Estimates of farm income as a
result of CWM Project investments indicate however that farmers have the
financial ability to pay higher water charge rates and repay a higher propor-
tion of watercourse materials. However, it would be necessary to slightly
increase the amortization period. Also, to decrease the provincial burden on
canal rehabilitation and lining cost, the project would seek through WUAs and
WU federations, a contribution from farmers for a portion of the unskilled
labor for the earthen work. Assurances were obtained from Punjab, Sind, and
Baluchistan that a minimum of 20, 25, and 25% respectively of the cost of
materials for watercourse renovation in this subproiect would be recovered
from the farmers. Assurance was obtained from NWIFP that it would carry out a
review of cost recovery for such materials and submit by February 1, 1985 a
program for effecting appropriate cost recovery with a view of implementing
such program in a time-frame and manner mutually satisfactory to IDA and the
Province. Under the proposed OFWM II project, scheduled for IDA appraisal in
October 1984, a Province-wide review will be undertaken in all Provinces to
deternmine the appropriate level of cost recovery for OFWM materials.

VII. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
General
7.01    The project would raise agricultural production and farm income on
about 510,000 ac through the provision of a package of improved water manage-
ment activities, along with improved management in the supply of agricultural
non-water inputs and services. Project investments would save about 290,000
ac/ft of irrigation water per year through investments on canal remodeling
and watercourse improvements. The project would also improve irrigation
water supply through better water scheduling, and reduce crop and property
losses caused by high watertable and storm flooding, and improve deliveries
of non water inputs. These activities would result in increased agricultural
production mainly from increases in cropping intensities and yields. By
reducing imports of wheat and increasing exports of rice and cotton, the
project would improve GOP's balance of payments. The project would also
significantly increase employment opportunities of the rural population.
Employment and Income Effect
7.02    Because of increases in cropping intensities, and to a lesser degree
to increases in yields, the project is expected to result in additional
direct annual farm employment of about 18,000 man/days.  In addition, water-
course improvements and canal lining proposed under the project would require
farmer labor contribution of about 28,000 man/days during the five-year
construction period. As the construction activities would be undertaken
during slack labor periods, it is expected that about 80% of this labor
requirement would be supplied by family labor. The value added in agricul-
ture, plus the increases in input requirements should also generate indirect
additional employment opportunities for farm families with excess family
labor and for landless families.
7.03    Since all direct benefits of project workers would come from
increased farm productivity, the distribution of benefits would largely
follow the existing pattern of land ownership. The two-thirds of the
intended beneficiaries would be small farmers operating less than 12.5 ac,
with current estimated per capita income ranging from US$50 to US$150, com-
pared with an estimated rural poverty income level of US$150 (1981 estimate).
It is estimated that about one-fourth to one-third of the direct benefits
would accrue to these small farmers.
Benefits to the Economy and Economic Analysis
7.04    Considering incremental capital, recurrent costs and benefits valued
in border rupees and constant current values, the Pakistan economy is expectd
to realize net benefits from proiect investments of about Rs 1,107 M in
present worth (PW). 1/ The economy of Pakistan would realize an economic
1/ Discounted at 10% p.a., estimated to be the opportunity cost of capital
in Pakistan.



-39-
rate of return (ERR) from project investments, inclusive of physical contin-
gencies, of about 24%. In calculating the economic viability of the project,
the benefits generated by reduction in seepage losses, and those generated by
more reliable water deliveries and reduction of crop production losses, have
been considered. To analyze the economic viability of each subproject, the
ERR, PW and switching values of individual subprojects were calculated and
are shown in Annex 6, Table 10. ERRs for such subprojects range from 12%
(Las Bela) to 36% (Sehra-Naulakhi). The economic real flow for the total
project is presented in Annex 6, Table 11. The following outlines the prin-
cipal assumptions underlying the economic analysis:
(a) Benefits. Project benefits are estimated mainly on the basis of
increased irrigated cropped area and yields resulting from water
savings, reduced seepage losses and to a lesser extent on more
reliable water and non water input deliveries and reduction of
crop losses due to high watertables and storm flooding.
Additional benefits such as less water travel time, improved
operational efficiency and ease of management have not been
quantified or included in the economic analysis. 'roject
incremental production is based on crop yield and intensity
described in paras 6.01-6.04.
(b) Project Life and Phasing. The project would have an anticipated
life of 30 years including a five-year implementation period.
The earthen work improvements on watercourses would need to be
replaced after about 10 years, and tubewells for subsurface
drainage after about 12 years (Annex 6, Table 12). Farmers
in all subproiects are fully accustomed to irrigation, and
improvements in canals and watercourses are fully visible to
them. Particularly in sub-system and watercourse tail areas,
increases in water deliveries will be apparent as soon as
modernization works on canals and watercourses are completed.
Therefore, and based on the evaluation of the OFM project, build
up of increased intensities is estimated at 60%, 80%, 90Z, 95%,
and 100% in the first to fifth year following completion of civil
works in a particular area. Yield increases are estimated to
have a somewhat slower build up rate, e.g., 5%, 15%, 35%-, 75%,
88%, 97%, and 100% from the first to the eighth year in currently
waterlogged areas, and 10%, 30%, 53%, 75%, 90%, and 100% from
the first to the sixth year in all other areas. Full project
development would be attained by the year 2005.
(c)  Prices.  For internationally traded goods, prices were derived
from projected 1984-1995 world market prices expressed in
constant early 1984 currency values. Appropriate adjustments
were made for freight,, handling, processing and quality
differentials. Pakistan is expected to become self-sufficient in
wheat by mid-1980s, and a net exporter by the end of the decade.
Therefore, an import parity price for wheat is used through 1989
and an export parity price for 1990 and later years. Prices
for non-traded goods are based on domestic financial prices.
Nonr-traded goods were expressed in border rupees through
application of a Standard Conversi.on Factor (SCF) of 0.90.
To adjust for output foregone during the slack period, a 20%



-40-
discount has been applied to the wage market rate. Input and
output prices used in the economic analysis are summarized in
Annex 6, Table 3.
(d) Project Costs. All project costs, except 50Z of the cost of
technical assistance and training, are included in the analysis.
Due to the pilot nature of the project, a high level of technical
assistance and training has been included under the project which
would not be necessary under a second phase of the CWM project.
Earthen work in the modernized watercourse is expected to last
only ten years and pumps for the subsurface drainage 12 years,
therefore, economic costs include the required reinvestment costs
and incremental 0 and M cost during the project life. Adiustment
to production cost streams was made to reflect realistically the
staggered incurrence of costs and derivation of benefits in
agricultural activities.
Project Risk and Sensitivity
7.05    Risks relating to the proposed engineering and agronomic project
components are considered relatively small. Executing agencies have
experience in carrying out works proposed under the project while farmers in
all subproject areas but Las Bela are fully exposed to irrigated agriculture.
Moreover, expected cropping intensities and yields are currently observed in
some individual farmers' holdings within the subproject areas. Therefore, no
unusual risks are foreseen regarding the project's implementation. However,
its success would depend on the coordinated and timely execution of all
proiect components and on a substantial involvement of the Water Users
Association on project planning and implementation. The major risk for this
project relates to achieving an efficient project management organization.
The management system proposed (paras 3.19-3.21 and 5.01-5.10) is viewed as a
pilot undertaking in Pakistan. However, this system is designed to closely
monitor and provide quick feedback for early resolution of implementation
bottlenecks. This would minimize the risk related to lack of coordination in
implementing the various project components and at the same time facilitate
the distribution of water and non-water inputs. The project management risks
are considered acceptable, especially in light of the relatively high ERR
(24%) for the project.
7.06    Other project uncertainties are, however, the amount of water
actually saved due to canal and watercourse modernization, in particular the
farmers' response to the increased water supplies, and the inability of Water
Users Associations to adequately operate and maintain the watercourses
improved under the project. Sensitivity tests were made to assess the impact
of these risks should they materialize. These tests show that all the sub-
proiects can absorb a substantial amount of shock and still remain economi-
cally viable. Annex 6, Table 11 summarizes the switching values on each of
the subprojects. Although Las Bela subproject has the lowest ERR (12%) and
the highest risk, inclusion of this subproject recognizes the high priority
GOP gives to development schemes in Baluchistan, the nation's least developed
province. Also, because of its proximity to Karachi, this subproject would
supply needed fresh fruits and vegetables to this large market.

Environmental Impact
7.07    The only adverse environmental impact envisaged is the small quantity
(about 20 cusecs) of saline drainage from the Shahkot subproject which will
outfall into the Ravi river. The project surface drainage component would
minimize the length and extent of flooding and stagnated water. This would
diminish the habitat for mosquito breeding and thereby reduce the incidence
of malaria.

operated under the Command Water Management Project (CWMP). The Imprest
Account would be opened in the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) by the Minis-
try of Water and Power.
2.      The Ministry of Water and Power, through the Finance Division,
would authorize the Provincial Departments of Irrigation and Power (PID)

would be individually administered by the Secretary, PID. Payments from
the subaccount would be exclusively for civil works (contracts and
materials) required for canal remodeling and rehabilitation and drainage
under the project.
3.      After the effectiveness of the Credit and on receipt of a
withdrawal application from GOP, IDA would withdraw Rupees 4 million
equivalent from the credit account for deposit in the Imprest Account.
The Ministry of Water and Power would transfer the appropriate amount
(Punjab Rs 2.56 M; Sind Rs 0.84 M; NWFP Rs 0.32 M and Baluchistan
Rs 0.28 M) to each of the four subaccounts (PLA) under the advice of the
Provincial Planning & Development and Finance Departments. Thereafter,

further withdraw from the credit amount to deposit and maintain in the
Imprest Account a level for payment of civil work expenditures required
for a consecutive four-month period; provided that the amount of any
deposit, together with any amount still on deposit in the Imprest Account
as of the date of such request or est:mate, shall not exceed in the
aggregate Rupees forty million (Rs 40,000,000).
4.     Simultaneouslv, the Provincial Gov  onments would deposit their
initial share to each of their own subaccount (Punjab Rs 128,000; Sind Rs
42,000; NWFP Rs 16,000 and Baluchristan RS 14,000) and would subsequently
maintain an amount in Rupees equivalent to 5% of the amount standing in
the subaccounts.
5.      The Ministry of Water and Power would consolidate all withdrawal
applications from the PIDs and verified by the project Supervisory Con-
sultant and submit to IDA for the amount drawn from the subaccount within
one month of their withdrawal. These applications would serve to record

made into the Imprest Account. Each withdrawal application would be
supported by a statement from the State Bank of Pakistan showing disbur-
semnts made during the preceding month(s) and closing balance.
6.      All withdrawals from the subaccount (PLA) would be in accordance
with the procedures prescribed by the Provincial Governments for operation
of PLAs. Checks to withdraw funds from the subaccount would be signed by
the Secretaries, PIDs or by an appropriate officer designated by the
Provincial Government. A monthly statement of the subaccount would be
prepared by the PIDs reflecting all transaction during the month and would
be forwarded tc IDA through the Ministry of Water and Power. All docu-
ments substantiating any payment made from the subaccount would be
retained by the PIDs.
7.      If for any reason IDA should disallow or reduce a submitted claim,
the Provincial Government would be required to make up the amount in the
subaccount.
8.      All the subaccounts would be audited in accordance with Section
4.01 (c) of the project's Development Credit Agreement.
9.      No further deposit in the Imprest Account/PLA would be made when
the total amount withdrawn under civil wo-ks component has reached the
equivalent of SDR 23,868,000 (US$ 25.4 M).
