APPRAISAL OF A ROAD PROJECT
(Apapa Road)
Summary
i.        The Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has asked the
Bank for financial assistance in carrying out a road project which forms
part of a larger program designed to relieve traffic congestion in Lagos.
The project consists of the reconstruction to modern 4-lane express-
way standards of the existing 2-lane Ijora Causeway and the Apapa road that
lead to the port. The project also includes the services of consultants:
i) to support and supplement the Ministry supervisory team in the field;
(ii) for a survey of an alternative new route between the port of Apapa and
the hinterland; iii) for a study of the re-classification of federal
roads; and iv) for a review of feasibility studies, followed by final
engineering, of abaut 600 miles of high priority federal roads for future
reconstruction.
ii.       The tentative cost of the Bank project is estimated at s 9.5 million,
or US$26,6 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component equal to
the proposed loan of US$17.5 million. This cost is based on final engineer-
ing and design of the project, of which 80% represents structures (overpasses-
underpasses, ramps and elevated sections).
iii.      The project is part of an overall road program that is designed to
prevent the burgeoning traffic of about 28,000 vehicles per day on the
existing roads from strangling the economic life of the city. In addition
to the Bank project, the program consists of the construction of a second
bridge linking the Lagos island with the mainland, a project which will be
financed from a loan granted by the Federal Republic of Germany and for which
the contract has just been awarded, as well as the reconstruction to 4-lanes
of the adjacent Western Avenue and the Agege Motor road for which U.S. AID
financing is under consideration.
iv.       The design-standards of the project roads are those of a modern
h-lane freeway, with level-free crossings and service roads for local traffic
on each side, flanked by a cycle and pedestrian track.
v.        The Federal Ministry of Roads will be responsible for the execution
of the project and will undertake supervision of the work in the field, with
assistance from a reputable consulting firm that is to be engaged as part of
the project.
vi.       Because the construction work is concentrated in a small area and
consists mainly of structures of standardized design, the work will be
awarded as one unit-price contract, on the basis of international competitive
bidding among prequalified contractors. The size of the contract (US$20 million)
is expected to attract large international contractors, either singly or in
joint venture with foreign contractors already established in Nigeria.



- ii -
vii.      WJhile traffic in the Lagos area generally has increased by 12% p.a.
in the recent past, on the project roads, which now carry some 28,000
vehicles daily, the rate of growth has been even faster. For the period
up to 1970, however, much lower rates of increase have been assumed. On
this basis, it is expected at the opening of the new road it will carry
about 40.,000 vehicles per day and reach its full capacity shortly thereafter.
viii.     Road users' savings in form of reduced operating costs on the new
roads for the above traffic, discounted over an assumed 25-year life of the
project, yield an estimated return of 11% on the investment. The return
increases to 13%o if the cost of the time delays caused by the closing of the
railway gates on the road (14 times a day) is taken into consideration.
ix.       The project is technically sound and economically justified.   Its
execution is of great importance to the economy of the country. The project
is suitable for a Bank loan of US$17.5 million equivalent, with a term of
25 years including a 5-year period of grace.

APPRAISAL OF A ROAD PROJECT
(Apapa Road)
I. INTRODUMTION
1.        The Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has asked for
the Bank's financial assistance in carrying out a road project that consists
of the priority reconstruction of two roads in Lagos and the employment of
foreign consultants to assist in the supervision of the construction work
and for other services described below.
2.        The construction part of the project involves the reconstruction
of the present Ijora Causeway and Apapa Road to 4-lane standards with com-
plementary service roads, cycle tracks, level-free intersections, ramps and
elevated structures. The services of consultants are required, in addition
to assist in the supervision of the construction works, to carry out the
following three studies:
a) the need, timing, approximate alignment and cost of an alter-
native route from Apapa port to Ibadan together with a
review, including such supplementary investigations that may
be necessary, in order to determine the feasibility of
improving the existing federal roads between Lagos and Ibadan;
b) the criteria necessary to determine which roads should be
of federal responsibility, the roads likely to be affected
by the application of these criteria and the broad financial
implications involved;
c) the finalizing of feasibility studies, to be followed by
final engineering, of some 600 miles of road to be used as
the basis for future projects.
3.        The total cost of the project is estimated at t 9.5 million, or
US$26.6 million equivalent. A Bank loan of US$17.5 million is requested to
cover the foreign exchange element.
4.        While the loan would be the first for Federal roads in Nigeria, it
would be a continuation of Bank/IDA lending to that country's transport
sector. In 1958 a loan of US$28.0 million equivalent (193-UNI) was made for
the rehabilitation of the railway. This has been followed in recent years
by a loan of US$13.5 million equivalent for port improvements (326-UNI);
and IDA Credit (73-UNI) of US$15.5 million for roads in Northern Nigeria
that grew out of an earlier Bank Technical Assistance Project (US$125,000);
a Technical Assistance Project of US$375,000 equivalent in 1964 towards a
road feasibility survey in Eastern Nigeria. The Bank is also acting as
executing agent for a UN-Special Fund road feasibility survey in Western
Nigeria. A road project involving a loan of US$14.5 million equivalent for
the reconstruction of three roads in Western Nigeria has just been negotiated.
5.        The present project is based on information obtained from the
Federal Government by the appraisal and economic mission staff members that
visited Nigeria in April-June 1965.

II. BACKGROUND
6.        The problem of ever increasing traffic congestion in Lagos has been
studied over recent years by the Federal Government's Ministry of Works; the
U.K. Road Research Laboratory; a U.N. expert and the Lagos Traffic Advisory
Committee (which is composed of business, government and railway nominees).
Various traffic engineering measures and some minor construction works have
delayed the crisis, but the time has now come that major works need to be
built in order to prevent the growing volume of traffic from strangling the
economic life of the city.
7.        For many years traffic in the Lagos area has been growing around
12% p.a. While there is no evidence of a slow-down in the immediate future,
such a long term growth rate is unlikely. A long-term growth rate averaging
as low as 3.5% p.a. would result in a doubling of traffic on the project
roads, which now carry 28,000 vehicles per day, over the expected economic
life of the project. Since the present 2-lane roads are overloaded, additio-
nal increments of traffic winl only aggravate congestion and delays unless
remedial action is taken.
8.        To solve the problem, therefore, the Federal Ministry of Works has
prepared a plan consisting of the following items that come within its juris-
diction (local streets being the responsibility of Lagos Town Council and the
Lagos Executive Development Board) (see Map 1):
a) The construction of a second bridge linking Lagos island with
the mainland. Even with reversible lane operations at peak
traffic hours, long traffic jams and back-ups occur on the
existing bridge which was built in the 1920ts. The Federal
Republic of Germany has agreed to provide up to the equivalent
of US$15 million for the construction of the new bridge by a
German contractor. A contract was signed on August 12, 1965
and work is expected to commence not later than March 1, 1966.
Construction time will be 3½ years.
b)  (i)  The widening of the present Ijora Causeway between the
intersection leading to the 2nd Mainland Bridge and the
Apapa road. The existing causeway, which runs over a swampy
area that is being reclaimed solely for industrial and com-
mercial use, is badly deformed and overloaded with traffic
that backs up for over one mile during peak hours.
(ii) The widening of the present Apapa road, which is inade-
quate even for present traffic, over its entire length from
the port gates to Western Avenue (see below and Map. 1) to the
same standards as b(i) above - 4-lane divided highway, with
service roads and cycle tracks - together with an elevated
structure to cross the railway line leading into the port and
which would connect with the Ijora Causeway.



c) The widening of Western Avenue (2.7 miles), which joins the
Apapa road, and the Agege Motor road (2.6 miles), which is
a continuation of Western Avenue and leads to the hinterland
of Lagos. This part of the program has been the subject of
a feasibility study by engineering and financed by U.S. AID
which concluded that the project (estimated.at,US$3,0 millior)
is fully justified. Discussions between Nigeria and U.S. AID
are now taking place and a final decision as to AID's partici-
pation in the project is expected soon.
9.        From the foregoing it can be seen that two parts of this master
program of vital road improvements are covered (or likely to be covered) by
bilateral foreign assistance. The request to the Bank is to participate in
the financing of the Ijora Causeway and Apapa road improvements (paragraph 8b
(i) and (ii) above).
10.       Although the three parts are technically separate, each being
capable of its own separate justification, they are so closely inter-related
that they may be regarded as one large and integrated program designed to
avoid a complete breakdown in traffic movement in the Lagos area, Further
long range projects associated with the three irmediate projects are envisaged
but are not planned for execution within the near future. One is to extend
the present Western Avenue southlwards from Apapa road to the intersection
of the 2nd Mainland Bridge with the Ijora Causeway. The other is a circum-
ferential highway in Western Nigeria around the Federal Territory of Lagos.
The Regional Government anticipates the spread of Lagos' population even
further into Western Nigeria and has begun to set aside land in readiness
for future construction of a road. The first section of this route may pro-
bably be the additional access road to the port for which a study is provided
in the project. An even longer range project is the possibility of a third
bridge linking Apapa with Victoria Island, but no planning for this has been
started yet.
11.       The three immediate projects form part of the Federal Government's
current 1962-68 Development Plan, which provides for about I 68 million
(US$190 million equivalent) to be spent on roads and bridges out of a total
planned public sector investment of t 510 million. Of this 1 68 million,
about X 5 million is for projects being directly and currently financed by
the Government; some t 28 million for projects being carried out by deferred
payments schemes by contractors; about E 21 million for foreign-aided pro-
jects (including the project under consideration in this report) for which
commitments have been, or it is hoped will soon be, made. The balance is
towards the cost of projects for which financing is not yet available, but
for which feasibility studies and final engineering are provided for in the
project (see paragraph 24 below). The ultimate cost of these latter pro-
jects is estimated at X 14 million approximately. Because of the financing
delays and the construction periods involved, it is expected that only
B 55 million of the t 68 million program will be actually executed in 1962-68,
the remainder being carried over to the next period.



III. FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS
12.       The Federal Ministry of Works, which has its headquarters in Lagos,
is responsible for the construction and maintenance of all federal roads in
Nigeria. These, which are called Trunk Roads "A", are defined as roads
connecting the Federal and Regional capitals, the ports with their hinterlands
and Nigeria with her neighbors. This is a purely administrative classifica-
tion unrelated to economic importance, traffic density or type of construction.
13.       Trunk Roads "AA" are distributed throughout the Regions of the
Federation approximately as follows:
Miles
Western Nigeria                                610
Eastern Nigeria                                690
Northern Nigeria                             4.,070
Mid-West Nigeria                               100
Federal Territory (Lagos)                       20
Total              5,49o
14.       Although the maintenance of these federal roads within the Region
is the responsibility of the Federal Ministry of Works, the Ministries of
Works of the Regional Governments act as its executing agents, for which they
receive an agency fee of 15% of the actual amounts expended. Those sections
of the Trunk Roads "A" lying within the Federal Territory of Lagos are main-
tained directly by the Ministry itself with its own forces. The two roads
included in this project for reconstruction, therefore, will be maintained
by the Ministry itself.
15.       In addition to its responsibility for federal roads and bridges, the
Ministry is also concerned with buildings, airports and Lagos waterworks. The
Roads Division is headed by an experienced Nigerian engineer as Director with
an able Nigerian as his Deputy, The Division is divided into 5 sections, each
headed by senior engineers reporting to a chief engineer, as follows: planning
and design; construction and maintenance; research and soils laboratory;
mechanical and electrical for the upkeep of plant and equipment; and a Lagos
Works Section that is solely concerned with road construction and maintenance
in the Federal Territory of Lagos. The total number of established technical
positions in the Division is 165, of which 36 posts are vacant.
16.       The Ministry has no permanent field offices; construction work on
federal roads is supervised from headquarters staff assigned to each particu-
lar job.
17.       The planning and design section is fairly well staffed and includes
some expatriate engineers. The survey and design for the project roads and
structures has been done by the Ministry's staff. Last year, at the Bank's
request, the designs were checked by a foreign consulting firm and generally
found satisfactory.



18.       Although there has been a rapid process of "Nigerianizationt" in
the Ministry, its staff is competent, many having been trained abroad and
are familiar with the type of works proposed. Nevertheless, since a
major road construction effort such as that in the project has never been
attempted in Nigeria before, it has been agreed as a loan condition that
the services of a first rank firm of consulting engineers would be engaged
to assist, check and advise the Ministry's supervisory team (paragraph 21
below).
IV. THE PROJECT
A Description
19.       The project to be financed by the Bank consists of:
(A)   The reconstruction to 4-lane standards of the Ijora Causeway
(about 1.2 miles) and the Apapa Fbad (about 2.5 miles) together
with complementary service roads, cycle tracks, intersections,
ramps and elevated structures.
(B)   Consultants' services:
(a) to assist in the supervision of works under part A;
(b) (i) to review the work done to determine the feasibility of
improving the existing roads from Lagos to Ibadan, and to
carry out any supplementary investigations that may be
necessary in order to determine whether they are economi-
cally justified; and (ii) to carry out a study to determine
the feasibility and economic justification for constructing
an additional road from the port of Apapa to Ibadan, the
approximate alignment of such road, its cost, and the timing
of its construction, taking into account the results of the
review and of any investigations carried out under (i) above;
(c)  to carry out a study of the trunk road network in Nigeria
for the purpose of (i) establishing the technical and econcmic
criteria    to be applied in determining which roads should
be under federal jurisdiction; (ii) indicating the roads
likely to be affected by application of those criteria; and
(iii) indicating the broad financial implications of apply-
ing those criteria;
(d)  to review the work done to determine the feasibility of im-
proving about 600 miles of three federal roads, and to carry
out any supplementary investigations that may be necessary in
order to determine whether they are economically justified;



- 6 -
(e) to carry out the final engineering of any road or section
covered by paragraph (d) above, and of a section of about
20 miles of any road or proposed road covered by paragraph
(b) above, which the Bank agrees is economically justified.
20.        As brought out in paragraph 8 above, the Ijora Causeway and Apapa
road improvement and reconstruction works are part of a master program for
the alleviation of traffic congestion in the Lagos area. The present project
roads, built to 2-lane standards, carry some 28,000 vehicles per day. Traffic
congestion is acute, and accidents are a serious problem. The physical condi-
tion of the present roads is poor. The embankment of the Causeway has become
deformed through settlement and the pavement has cracked in places. The
Apapa road exhibits numerous base failures which are attributable to the
original low design and the heavy volume of traffic it now carries. On both
roads drainage facilities are almost non-existent. The carrying out of minor
repairs, which necessitate channelling the traffic into one lane, adds to the
general congestion.
21.        As pointed out in paragraph 18 above, the Ministry now has, or
expects to recruit, sufficient experienced engineers to carry out the routine
aspects of supervision of the construction works. However, because of the
magnitude of the works with their elevated structures, complex overpasses,
underpasses and ramps and because the difficult soil conditions in the area
may create special foundation problems, the Ministry will employ a first rank
consulting firm to supply 4-5 senior engineers to assist, check and advise
the Ministry's team.
22.        The project and the associated works on the 2nd Mainland Bridge
and Western Avenue/Agege Motor Road will solve many immediate traffic prob-
lems in Lagos, and in particular those of access to the port of Apapa. The
question of an additional access route from the port to its hinterland is
likely to arise, however, in the future as port traffic increases and its
facilities are extended. A study of the need, timing, approximate alignment
and cost of such a road has been made part of the project. Since this road
would have to join with one of the two existing federal roads leading from
Lagos to Ibadan, Nigeria's largest city, or with an additional new road
between these cities, the study also includes a review of the work already
done to determine the feasibility of either a new route or the improvement
of either of the existing roads.
23.        For the first 20 miles or so out of Lagos the most heavily used of
these roads crosses a large mangrove swamp area. The road's physical con-
dition is poor. Bridges in the section are single lane. The embankment is
generally too low and, as a result, sections of the road are overtopped and
damaged during the annual floods.  (In 1963 both roads and the railway were
breached, thus cutting Lagos off from the rest of the country for many days).
The alignment of the other road follows, in many places, a railway embankment
that was abandoned in the early 1900's, and has many dangerous curves.  Its
total length to Ibadan is about 30 miles longer than by the other route.



- 7 -
Since the need to improve road communications over the first 20 miles out of
Lagos is of high priority, the project provides for the necessary engineer-
ing either for the improvement of one of the existing routes to Ibadan or
for a new alignment. The solution arrived at would be tied into the addi.-
tional access route to the port of Apapa, after an economic investigation
by consultants (paragraph 25 below).
24.       A long-standing political and fiscal problem of road development
in Nigeria concerns the limits of Federal and Regional governmental respon-
sibility. With steady traffic increases on their low design standard roads,
the Regional Governments are being faced with demands for greater maintenance
expenditures and much greater capital expenditures for reconstruction and
'upgrading. Since some regional roads are now carrying traffic volumes in
excess of those on some sections of the Federal network, the Regional Govern-
ments are anxious to transfer responsibility for them to the Federal Govern-
ment. By contrast the Federal Government is responsible for some roads which
it considers are of purely regional significance and ought to be handed over
to the Regions. Both the Federal and Regional Governments would like some
independent expert advice: first, to establish appropriate economic and
technical criteria for the classification of federal roads; secondly, to
indicate, on the basis of these criteria, the roads likely to be classified
as Trunk Roads "AA"; and thirdly, to give some orders of magnitude as to the
financial implications involved. This last point is of significance in that
while road users throughout the Federation are now contributing about Z 16-
17 million annually to governmental revenues, the lion's share of gasoline
and diesel taxes goes to the Regions as a result of the present revenue
allocation system. In practice, a large part of these revenues is generated
on the Federal roads in each Region. The Federal Government retains only
some t 3.5 million, being made up of vehicle and driver's license fees col-
lected in Lagos and its share of gasoline and diesel taxes attributable to
fuel consumption in that city. Its annual expenditures on road maintenance
are some t 2 million. Recent capital expenditures on federal roads have been
around t 5 million annually. For the Federation as a whole, total road user
taxes exceed present annual capital and maintenance expenditures on roads.
25.       In order to start a pipeline of projects suitable for future foreign
financing as well as to fill part of the investment-resources gap in the
current (1962-68) Development Plan, the project provides for the review by
consultants of the feasibility of improvement works for about 600 miles of
road, and the completion of the engineering up to final design and prepara-
tion of bidding documents. These roads, which comprise that part of the
program under the Plan for which financing has not been assured (paragraph 11
above), together with one other road -Ibadan-Ife (52 miles) - that is in
urgent need of reconstruction but which is not included in the current Plan,
are as follows (Map 2):

l/ mission's rough estimate of the value of reconstruction work to bring
to 2-lane bituminous standards.
2/ relates only to construction cost of first 20 or so miles.
26.       The Bank understands that U.S. AID is thinking of financing a
feasibility study for the Port Harcourt-Aba road. This road, therefore, is
not included in the Bank project. For the other roads preliminary engineering
has been prepared to a certain extent by the Ministry of Works. The pro-
ject provides that this, together with the economic feasibility work already
done, will be reviewed by consultants and any supplementary studies necessary
to substantiate the feasibility of bringing the roads up to adequate 2-lane
bituminous surfaced standards will be carried out. At an estimated fee of
E 750 per mile for this review, any supplementary studies and for final
engineering the total cost would be E 450,000, or about US$1.25 million
equivalent, of which 70% or US$900,000 is the estimated foreign exchange com-
ponent. The release of funds for the final engineering of any particular
road or road section would be conditional on the Bank being satisfied as to
the economic justification brought out by the reviews.
B. Design Standards and Contract Terms
27.       The design standards adopted for the two roads to be constructed
under the project are based on modern freeway (motorway) standards, and are
satisfactory. The freeway will consist of a divided 4-lane highway, each
carriageway generally being 24 ft. wide with a median strip of 6 ft. Adja-
cent to the freeway on both sides will be 24 ft. wide service roads to carry
local traffic from nearby factories and business establishments. A 10-ft.
cycle and pedestrian track is added to each of the service roads.
28.       The Ijora Causeway will be a 4-lane main highway at ground level
between the intersection with the new bridge and the intersection with the
Apapa road, with a slight diversion of one service lane to overcome right-
of-way problems. From the Point road junction to the Malu road intersection
the Apapa road will be at ground level. Between Malu road and the Pressed
Metal Works intersection the whole road will be elevated, crossing the main
railway line at the Lily Pond. From the Pressed Metal Works intersection to
the junction with Western Avenue the road returns to ground level, but is
divided because of soil and right-of-way conditions (see Map).



- 9 -
29.       The service roads are a necessity not only for future traffic needs
but also from the construction point of view. The main highway mostly follows
the existing 2-lane Causeway and Apapa road, but adequate provision must be
made during the construction period for the daily volume of traffic moving
over the present roads. This will be done by building the service roads
first. Traffic will then be diverted to these roads so that work can be
carried out on the main highway.
30.       The contract conditions to be applied derive from the standard
British road works contract procedures and are acceptable to the Bank. The
contract form will be of the unit-price type based on given quantities.
C. Cost of the Project
31.       The final engineering of the earthwork and the structures involved
in the two roads is complete, and the quantities established, applied to
current unit prices, have provided reliable cost estimates for this part of
the works. The unit price figures check closely with the average figures
from tenders received for the 2nd Mainland bridge.
32.       The final cost figures as estimated by the Ministry for the cons-
truction of the two roads include a certain contingency for variations of
the quantities. To safeguard against higher unit prices than anticipated
and higher costs because' of unforseen foundation difficulties, a 20% con-
tingency has been added to the Ministry's basic cost estimate. A summary of
the total cost estimate of I 9.5 million or $26.6 million equivalent, of
which $17.5 million represents the foreign exchange cost, is as follows:
Cost of the Project
A.  Road construction:                          E'000             US$1000
1. Apapa Road
2.  Ijora Causeway
7,224
20% contingency                           1,444
Sub-total.                        8,668     24,300
B. Consultants' Services:
1.  Supervision - 50 months @ I 6,000         0,300
2. Alternative hinterland road study          0,030
3. Federal road classification study          0,040
4. Review of feasibility work and

Sub-total                         0,820      2,300
Total              9,488     26,600
Foreign exchange component
65% of construction cost = 65% of E 8.668 million = E 5.64 million
70% of consultants' fees = 70% of E 0.82 million = E 0.56 million
Total        = E 6.20 million
or US$17.5 million equivalent



- 10 -
33.       The foreign exchange component of the road works (including struc-
tures) has been estimated by the Ministry of Works at 65% of total cost.
This is the same as for the IDA financed road project in the Northern Region
and for the recently negotiated Bank project in the Western Region. For the
road works part of this jproject, the same percentage is reasonable (including
depreciation of equipment). While the foreign component in structural works
is usually lower than on road works, in this case large amounts of imported
high cost, high tensile reinforcing steel will be required for the prestressed
concrete structures, An average foreign exchange component of 65% for road
works and structures is, therefore, acceptable. The import of equipment,
bitumen and reinforcing steel is free of duty. The local cost component covers
labor, materials and other local charges.
D. Execution of the Project
34.       The greatest part (80%) of the cost of the construction works is
for structures (overpasses, ramps, elevated road sections, etc.) for which
elements such as beams, pillars, etc., are to be standard precast and pre-
stressed. This,together with the concentration of the structures into a
few locations, means that there would be advantages in execution, cost and
traffic control by keeping the work in a single contract.
35.       The contract will be awarded to a prequalified contractor on the
basis of international competitive bidding and in accordance with the Bank's
"Guidelines". Because of the size of the contract ($20 million) and the
specialized nature of the work, it is anticipated that very large international
contractors will be interested, either singly, or in a joint venture among
themselves, or with one or more of the foreign firms already established in
the country.
36.       It is expected that the work will need four dry seasons to com-
plete. Each contractor taking part in the bidding, however, will be re-
quested to supply an overall construction schedule with his offer.  The award-
ing of the contract will be made only after a close appraisal of the bids
received by the Ministry, in cooperation with the consultants chosen, and
review by the Bank.
E. Disbursement Schedule and Local Financing
37.       Over the expected four-year construction period, the disbursement
of funds would be approximately as follows:
1 million
Total      Foreign       Local
Year 1.                       2.10        1.4o         0.70
Year 2.                       3.20        2.10         1.10
Year 3.                       3.00        1.90         1.10
Year 4.                       1.20        o.80         0.40
E                        9.5o        6.20         3.30



38.       On this basis the Federal Government would be obliged to provide
about E 3.0 million in total over the remaining 3 years of the current six-
year Development Plan. While it already has large commitments for the current
road and bridges program under the Plan, the Ministry of Finance has indicated
that in view of the high priority it gives to the project the necessary
E 1 million or so required annually will be found.
V. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A. Background
39.       Lagos is Nigeria's second largest city, the largest port and main
commmercial and industrial activity in Africa's most populous country. The
present population of the four islands and the four towns on the mainland
that make up greater Lagos is about 675,000. About 25% of the people are
concentrated on the two square miles of Lagos island. As people move off
the island, either because of personal economic advancement or the slum clear-
ance schemes being carried out, the areas vacated are being converted to
offices, shops, etc. The effect is to lengthen and mechanize the journey
to work and to transfer part of the problem of road improvement to the main-
land.
40.       Lagos is the terminal point of the Western Branch of the Nigerian
Railway.  The city is also served by two main Trunk Roads "A" running to
Ibadan, a city of over 500,000 people and the capital of Western Nigeria.
The first section of one of the roads leads to the international airport at
Ikeja and then, some 15 miles farther on, connects with the newly recons-
tructed main route to Dahomey, Ibgo and Ghana.
41.       The port of Lagos has two general cargo wharf areas in addition
to specialized bulk handling facilities for petroleum products, vegetable
oils, coal and wheat. One, on the island of Lagos, is known as the Customs
Quays, the other and larger facility is on the opposite side of the harbor
at Apapa. There are no rail facilities at Customs Quays, all cargo being
transported by truck. These quays primarily handle import traffic destined
for Lagos island itself or for redistribution by merchants based there. The
question of closing them before 1970 is under active consideration in order
to avoid large rehabilitation expenditures and to maximize the use of the
Apapa facilities where 4 new berths are under construction with the help of
Bank Loan 326-UNI (US$13.5 million). A further Bank-financed extension of
Apapa Quays is under consideration.
42.       The tonnage of general cargo imports moving over the Apapa Quays
has increased from 345,000 tons in 1955/56 to 701,000 tons in 1964/65, a
rate equivalent to slightly over 8% p.a. Exports, in the same period,
increased at a rate just under 7% p.a. from 530,000 tons to 958,000 tons.
Of greater significance from the viewpoint of the project is the great in-
crease in the amounts of cargo handled by road transport serving the Apapa
Quays, as the following figures show:- (see Table 1).

1957-58                267         150      370            176
1959-60                243         270      451            222
1961-62                324         369      465            344
1964-65                176         525      474            484
43.       The uneven performance of the railway in clearing imports is partly
a reflection of its own special problems, partly a result of the general
improvement in efficiency and specialization of road transport, but more
important, is due to the growing development of import substitution by manu-
facturing industry in Nigeria. Consumer goods that formerly were imported
and moved up-country by rail are now being manufactured or assembled in the
Apapa area.  The raw materials, semi-processed goods or parts used are now
moved from the port by road with the final products being redistributed by
rail or road. The growing volume of imported capital goods required often
necessitates large specialized trucks or general trucking to places not served
by the railway. Other import goods moving by road are those for which the
door-to-door service, speed and lower handling costs of trucking makes it
the most economical transport medium.
44.       Because of the production location of the large volume of cocoa
and palm kernel exports they can be moved more economically from buying
centers to the port by road (Table 2). The tonnage of truck-hauled ground-
nuts and cotton seed for export has increased because of the railway's
inability to move them. In 1964-65 exceptionally large volumeb o6f these com-
modities arrived by road and added to the general and usual traffic conges-
tion on the Apapa road. At times up to 200 trucks, many with trailers, were
backed up hundreds of yards from the port gates. There was general confusion
as these vehicles maneuvered about trying to find anywhere to park off the
main carriageway.
B. The Project Roads
45.       About 1 million tons of import and export cargoes moved over the
Apapa Road in 1964-65. In addition, the roads are used by petroleum tank
trucks from the bulk oil terminal, large cement tank trucks destined for
the Kainji Dam site and elsewhere, and vehicles serving the vast prolifera-
tion of industries and businesses located along the roads.- These industries
and businesses include e.g. structural steel works; motor vehicle assembly
plants; soft drink factories; the largest brewery in Nigeria; industrial gas
plants; bakeries; margarine, metal furniture, paint and soap, etc. factories;
a large flour mill; two cement clinker grinding plants; cold storage and
processing facilities; motor vehicle distributors' storage yards and their
showrooms; office buildings; gasoline service stations; the yards and work-
shops of large road transporting firms, and a fire department station.



- 13 -
46.       The resulting traffic is an amalgam of small distribution vans,
large trucks (some carrying exceptionally heavy or wide loads), minibuses,
large omnibuses belonging to the Lagos Municipal Transport Service, private
cars taking people to and from work in the port, in offices and factories
and from the large growing residential area to the north of the Apapa road,
as well as pedestrians and cattle on the hoof. This noisy, colorful
kaleidoscope of traffic is held up about 14 times daily whilst trains enter
or leave the Apapa quays area.
47.       Although traffic concerned with the port area is estimated to be
only about 40% of-the total traffic on the roads, the persistent traffic
hold-ups have a particularly detrimental effect on port clearances, quite
apart from those suffered by the variety of other users, for the following
reasons:
(i) The extra time taken by trucks to travel between the quays
and the importers' warehouses means that fewer round trips
can be made. Since the port authorities rental charges are
punitive, and normally no allowance is made for road delays
as an excuse, to move their goods quickly business firms
are forced into either buying more trucks or larger trucks
which adds to the congestion.
(ii) These additional and/or larger trucks all try to report at
the commencement of work with the result that more trucks
than necessary mill around the port area. Instead of the
port delivery staff enjoying an even flow of work as trucks
return from their first and subsequent trips during the day
they are plagued with priority requests that put them into
invidious positions and affects efficient programmed handling.
(iii) The traffic position provides a ready-made excuse to importers
for any shortcomings in clearing their cargo and involves
the port authorities in time-consuming arguments as to whether
the real reasons for delay are inside or outside the port.
(iv) With the general rise in transport costs (and particularly
wage awards) in recent years these delays are becoming
increasingly onerous to the business community.
(v) Instead of the port being able to clear all cargo for road
movement in normal working hours, overtime working has been
resorted to. The Authority has made a concession of giving
delivery for two extra hours on normal working days as well
as over the weekends at no additional charge to the importer.
This concession, however, is not popular with importers as
it involves them in additional costs to keep their own stores
open, or is difficult to arrange if a bonded storekeeper has
to be in attendence.



(vi) While road delays to exports do not materially affect port
operations, in that goods are often loaded on board ship from
stock piles in the sheds and warehouses, the steadily increas-
ing volume of road arrivals means that the Port Authority
will have to increase the size of truck parking space in order
to provide for vehicles that have unloaded and are awaiting
their turn for return loads.
(vii) Apart from delays in the movement of cargo, there is a serious
question of time lost to the Port Authority's staff travelling
on the Apapa road to and from work. It is estimated that some
staff have one hour added to their working day unnecessarily
because of the road congestion. Considerable time is also
lost by managerial, government and business officers attending
meetings in the port.
48.       A further problem on the Apapa road is that of accidents.  In 1964,
for example, 13 fatal accidents, 91 personal injury accidents and 437 other
accidents (usually property damage) were reported. With traffic separation
and channellization and proper facilities for pedestrians and cyclists it is
expected that the accident rate can be reduced.
C. Future Trends
(i) Population
49.       According to an estimate by the Federal Office of Statistics,
Nigeria's population is expected to grow from about 55 million in 1963 to
around 95 million by 1985, or equivalent to 2.5% p.a., and the population
of Lagos to increase from 670,000 to about 1.9 million. The bulk of the
Lagos population growth is expected to be absorbed along Western Avenue, in
Apapa and by the expansion of the urban area into lWestern Nigeria.
(ii) Land Use
50.       About 1,000 acres of land are scheduled for reclamation in Apapa.
Much of this has already been done with 230 acres of land being set aside
solely for industrial development. At present, there are about 20,000 per-
sons living in a mile or so wide belt running immediately north of the Apapa
road. Using the Lagos Executive Development Board desirable density guide of
250 persons per acre (as compared with 2,000 per acre at present on Lagos
Island) it has been estimated that over 200,000 people may be eventually
settled within the immediate influence of the improved roads.
51.       Work is under way in developing the Iganmu industrial area, in the
northwest quadrant of the Apapa road and Western Avenue, to the extent of 163
acres. The only other available and scheduled land for industrial expansion
within Lagos itself is along the Apapa road and Ijora Causeway. Reclamation
alongside the Causeway has begun, but much remains for development. Future
workers will not live in the area and will require motor transportation to
their work.



- 15 -
(iii) Vehicle Licensing and Traffic
52.       Since 1958 total vehicle licenses in Nigeria have been increasing
at 12% p.a. (141% for private cars and 7.5% p.a. for commercial vehicles). By
1963, of the 65,o00 total vehicles licensed in the country some 13,000
vehicles were in Lagos (Table 3). The licensing of a vehicle in one Region
of Nigeria, however, does not necessarily mean that it will mainly operate in
that Region. For example, many of the vehicles registered in Western Nigeria
are in the suburbs of Lagos and are used primarily in this city.
53.       Oil company sources project the increase in commercial vehicles
between 1963-70 at 5% p.a. and private cars at 7.5% p.a. No projection has
been made for beyond 1970 nor has a breakdown of this total been made for
Lagos or the project road area specifically. The views of other analysts and
the Bank's own observations in similar circumstances suggest that these
national growth rates are reasonable, particularly for urban areas such as
Lagos. Applying these national growth rates, which are much lower than those
recently experienced on the project roads, to the existing traffic on the
Apapa road, gives the following estimates of average daily traffic in 1970,
when the construction works are expected to be completed.
Traffic on the Apapa Road (ADT)
1962      1964      1965      1970
(Aug.)    (July)    (Fe)b.
Private Cars        13,165    13,972    17,422    25,000
Commercial Cars,
Vans, etc.        3,767    3,938      41,934    6,300
Trucks               3,934    4,148      5,154     6,600
Buses                  382      413        514       650
Total         21,248   22,471     28,024    38,550
54.       The addition of a further 10,000 vehicles per day will create a
traffic load that is almost insupportable for the present rcads. In other
words, traffic conditions will continue to deteriorate until the project is
completed. The projection of trucking is in line with the Port Authority's
own estimate of the likely increase in traffic over the quays and the Bank's
economic mission estimates of import/export trends.
D. Benefits of the Project
55.       For the purpose of calculating the economic benefits no increase in
traffic after 1970 has been allowed for since it is assumed that the road is
likely to reach its capacity shortly thereafter. Since there is more danger
of inadequate transport capacity rather than of excess capacity, the study of
an alternative access route to the port is included in the project.



- 16 -
56.       The most important economic benefits from the project's construc-
tion works are reduced transport costs and time savings. On the basis of
Nigerian studies, which appear reasonable, it can be estimated that the
new roads will permit a reduction from 15.7 pence per vehicle mile to 11.7
pence per vehicle mile for the average vehicle unit - a proportionate saving
that compares well with that found, for example, for similar expressway pro-
jects financed by the Bank. These reductions reflect the increase in
average speed which the new highway will permit and the consequent lower
consumption of gasoline and oil, reduced clutch and brake wear, etc., and
lower cost for depreciation and drivers' wages. The total reduction in
operating costs in 1970 is estimated at about E 1 million. Discounted on
an annuity basis over an assumed 25-year life of the project these annual
savings are equivalent to a return of about 11% on the investment.
57.       The question of the value of time-saving to vehicle users can be
controversial, particularly in the context of developing countries. Detailed
analyses carried out by the U.S. AID consultants on Western Avenue, which
joins the Apapa road, show, however, that only 16.5% out of the 24,000 auto-
mobile trips sampled were for pleasure while 37% were going to and from work
with the remaining 46.5% being vehicles operated "on duty", i.e. in the course
of the individual's work or business, The average occupancy of cars going
to and from work was 2.90 persons, those being used "on duty" 3.05 and those
being used for personal or pleasure purposes 3.11 persons. The average
occupancy of trucks was 5.72 persons and of buses 24.22 passengers. The
existing delays, therefore, affect a large segment of the business community
and its employees. These are not included in the computation of the 11% return
above.
58.       No sophiscated analysis comparable to that employed, for example,
in Japan or Mexico has been used'in Nigeria to evaluate the costs of such
time delays. The planning section of the Ministry of Works, however, carried
out a study, with reasonable corrective factors for the Nigerian scene, which
showed that delays attributable to the closing of the railway gates on the
Apapa road 14 times daily could be valued at E 125,000 p.a., and that the
cost of other standing delays caused through traffic congestion could be put
at about E 640,000 p.a. Allowance for only the value of delays which are
caused at the railway crossing would increase the return on the project to
nearly 13%. This is an acceptable rate of return which excludes other bene-
fits such as a possible reduction in the accident rate, considerable in-
creases in comfort and convenience, and the important external economies
accruing to the Port Authority and business in general.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
59.       The proposed construction works in the project, as part of a
larger program     will help to relieve the severe traffic congestion in
greater Lagos,-and will provide for a continuous flow of about 40,000 vehi-
cles per day in one of Africa's largest and busiest ports. The project is
sound and adequately justified economically to meet the increasing traffic
demands of a growing industrial area and expanding port.



- 17 -
60.       The consultant services to be provided under the project (other
than those for assisting in the supervision of construction) are fundamental
to the evolution of sound highway planning in Nigeria and the preparation
of future projects.
61.       During the loan negotiations the Bank was informed that discussions
taking place between Nigeria and the U.S. AID on the financing of the Western
Avenue and the Agege Motor road, and that a final decision by U.S. AID could
be expected during the month of September. The negotiated loan documents
oblige the Nigerian Government to complete construction of the two roads not
later than December 31, 1970.
62.       The proposed project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$17.5 million equivalent. An appropriate term, given the construction
period and expected economic life of the construction works, would be 25
years including a 5-year period of grace.

eL  Commercial vehicles include all trucks and lorries, buses, tractors and special
purpose vehicles owned by Commerce, Government or Statutory Corporation.
b/  Private vehicles include all saloon cars and taxis, and light trucks owned by
private persons, missions and schools.
c/ The region in which a vehicle is registered is not necessarily that in which
it will operate.
1/ The fall in 1963 in truck licenses is partly a consequence of the political and
economic upsets in Western Nigeria. While total figures for 1964 were not
available, the figures for imports and new registrations suggest a return to
trend. The decline in Northern licenses is disguised by the greatly increased
use of larger trucks, many of which, on long hauls, operate with locally made
trailers attached. Based on import figures and recent replacement rates,the
mission estimates total vehicles in 1965 to be between 24-25,000.
