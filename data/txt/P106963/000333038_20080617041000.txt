                                 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

 1.              Tajikistan i s a small mountainous land-locked Central Asian coukry with
an economy that heavily depends, as a legacy o f the soviet economy, on exports o f cotton,
aluminum and hydroelectricity that are three rather environmentally sensitive sectors, as
well as on remittances from migrants living abroad'. The macroeconomic performance has
been impressive since the end of the recent civil war; the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
has been growing at an average rate o f 8.7 %2 in the last five years.    The country has a
population o f about 7 million in2007, with about 75% living in rural areas. It has a GDP
per capita o f $390, which is the lowest among the 15 former Soviet republics.            The
population has been growing at about 1.3% during 2002-2006 and the per capita income        --
at 5.9%.
2.               Environmental degradation and unsustainable use o f natural resources are
constraints to sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. With more than half o f
its territory situated above 3,000 meters, the country i s particularly vulnerable to natural
disasters. The country's economy further deeply suffered from both the disintegration o f
the Former Soviet Union in 1991 and the Civil War that began in 1992. Impoverished by
sudden shortages of fuel, income, and food, the population reverted to subsistence
practices, which put an extra burden on the natural resources and the environment o f the
country.
3.               The environmental challenges in the country, according to the recent
National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) are (i)land degradation, including
deforestation, degradation o f pasturelands, arable and irrigated lands; (ii)lack o f improved
drinking water and water quality deterioration; (iii)waste pollution from agriculture and
industry; (iv) deficiencies in sewerage system infrastructure and management; (v)
uncollected and untreated solid waste; (vi) environmental hazards and natural disasters
caused by floods and drought; (vii) energy supply; and (viii) lack o f environmental
education.
4.               While acknowledging that the problems o f unsustainable farming practices
continue to persist, today's most important environmental challenges in Tajikistan consist
o f dealing with natural disasters like floods and draught and as well as reducing the
incidence o f waterborne diseases and illnesses caused by urban and indoor air pollution,
and minimizing vulnerability o f rural population to natural disasters. These categories o f
environmental damages have an economic cost o f 4.8% o f gross domestic product (GDP),
and they primarily affect the poor. Future environmental challenges could result from
climate change that exacerbates existing environmental problems. Soil degradation due to,
irrational pastures management, and deforestation by indiscriminate felling o f trees
leading to the destruction o f critical watersheds and wildlife habitats. Efforts to mitigate
potential future environmental challenges would consequently need to control these
potential detrimental activities and their cumulative impacts. In addition, efforts would be
needed to prevent plundering and uncontrolled exploitation o f Tajikistan's land and water
resources, and to supporting reforms in key sectors like cotton, energy, and private sector
development that may have impacts on environment and natural resources.

5.               Tajikistan has responded to its environmental challenges by developing and
continuously strengthening the environmental management framework. Although the
country scffered from civil war and political instability for about a decade since
independence in 1992, policies and programs for environmental protection began to
emerge as early as 1997. The government has since developed and implementedvarious
programs for environmental protection. The analysis suggests that the key constraints in
environmental management in the country are not from the absence o f well defined
environmental policies but rather from inadequate legislation and bylawdguidelines to
implementspecific polices inparticular, weaknesses ininstitutional design, lack o f vertical
and horizontal coordination, lack o f capacity o f institutions, and insufficient funding. A
numberof national and local/provincial level agencies and different ministriesare involved
inthe environmental management. There exist opportunities for significant improvement
in environmental management through better coordination among the different agencies.
The analysis also suggests that policies currently followed do not provide economic
incentives for pollution reduction and more efficient use o f natural resources.
6.               The CEA found that the government has set norms for air and water
pollution, residual traces o f chemicals and biologically harmful microbes in food,
regulations regarding noise, vibration and magnetic fields, exceeding the threshold levels
results in administrative actions and financial sanctions. However, their implementation
remains unsatisfactory due mainly to weak institutions and lack o f vertical and horizontal
coordination. Although the government has enacted a number o f laws and proposals to
improve the state o f the environment, there is very limited state capacity for policy
development, regulation, and implementation.
CEA Objectives
7.               The significance o f natural resources inthe development process continues
to remain vastly underestimated in policy deliberations in Tajikistan. In part, this reflects
the absence of credible quantitative evidence of the economic effects o fenvironmental and
resource degradation and understanding o f the critical linkages between broader policy
reforms and their implications for environment and resource base. The objectives o f the
Tajikistan Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) are: (a) to deepen the understanding o f
the economic costs of the country's major environmental challenges; (b) to assess
institutional capacity within the country for sound environmental management; and (c) to
help strengthen institutions and governance to enhance environmentaloutcomes.
InstitutionalFramework
8.               Tajikistan faces a number o f environmental challenges. The environmental
degradation, including air and water pollution and their effects on environmental health,
problems in waste management, soil erosion and degradation, degradation o f rangelands,
and orchards, deforestation and loss o f biodiversity and natural disasters are highly visible
inthe country. There is a broadconsensus at the national and sub-national levels that there
i s an urgent needto address the environmental problems inthe country. Inorder to address
these issues the country requires effective environmental policies, laws and strong
institutions to implementthem.
9.               The constitution declares that the State must ensure a healthier environment
and guarantee an efficient use o f natural resources for the benefit o f the people o f
Tajikistan.   The environment protection law stipulates several types o f controls and
institutions to comply with at the state, ministerial, business and community levels. At the

                                                8

national level there i s an environmental block, the Department o f Nature Use and
Protection, chaired by a Deputy Minister under the Ministry o f Agriculture and Nature
Protection. The State Control Service o f Natural Resources and Environmental Protection
under the Department o f Nature Use and Protection is the national level agency for
environmental affairs inthe country.
10.             In addition to the SCSNREP, the Sanitary Inspection Service of the
Ministry of Health and Inspection Service on Mining Safety, the Ministry of Mines are
involved in environmental management. At the ministerial level, enforcement i s done by
different ministries and the state agencies; however with no effective coordination across
the ministries. In addition to the state level and ministerial level controls there is a
business level control that implies that every business has to observe the environmental
law. Although the government has set norms for air and water pollution, residual traces o f
chemicals and biologically harmful microbes in food, regulations regarding noise,
vibration and magnetic fields, exceeding the threshold levels results in administrative
actions and financial sanctions: their implementation remains unsatisfactory mainly due to
weak institutions to implement them and lack o f vertical and horizontal coordination,
across institutions.
11.             The analysis found that the binding constraints for improved environmental
performance in the country are: (i)weak institutional design (ii)lack o f coordination
among institutions; (iii)lack o f economic incentives for pollution reduction and
accountability; (iv) capacity limitations; (v) poor environmental governance and (v)
insufficient funding for environmental management. The solutions to these problems will
not arise from simply scaling up the institutions or increasing funding for environmental
management, but to require careful planning and coordination at all levels backed by legal
and regulatory mechanisms.
12.             Both federal and provincial governments share legislative authority and
responsibility for environmental management and efficient use o f natural resources. In
order to achieve better outcomes, institutions at all levels should have appropriate roles and
responsibilities.   At the national level the roles could include: (a) setting national
environmental policy and defining specific goals for environmental quality; (b) providing
resources, both technical and financial, and oversight for local/provincial environmental
authorities; (c) reporting and publishing data on progress in meeting the national
environmental objectives. The national environmental agency should have the mandate for
enforcement o f national laws and regulations and oversight on local/provincial
environmental agencies.
13.             While the national level agency sets the national policy, responsibilities o f
the provincial environmental authorities could include environmental clearance at the local
level, implementation and compliance as well as monitoring o f ambient environmental
quality standards. There i s also need for specific guidelines for national oversight o f the
provincial environmental authorities depending on the provincial laws and regulations for
enforcement, adequacy o f technical expertise, staff and resources.
14.             Tajikistan has a set o f economic incentives in the form o f charges and
payments for waste products generated and pollutant discharges in to air and water bodies.
The analysis however showed that the fees for waste collection are not sufficient to
stimulate reduction in wastes, development and adoption o f environment friendly
production technologies that reduce waste generation.         In the case o f air and water


                                             9

pollution, current system o f payments is not economically efficient as it does not provide
enough economic incentives to reduce emissions.              Automobile emissions constitute
another main source o f air pollution. The government charges an automobile tax that does
not promote fuel efficiency and emission reductions.
15.              In addition to prices and charges, the government has enforced quantity
restrictions on the amount o f wastes and pollutants that can be discharged into air and
water.    There are also quota restrictions on the quantity o f water, mineral and other
resources o f that could be used by individual business entities. However, the enforcement
o f these restrictions i s constrained by the available infrastructure for monitoring and
enforcement.
16.              One o f the most serious weaknesses o f Tajikistan's environmental
management framework is the lack o f capacity for environmental planning. A
misalignment between environmental priorities, institutional efforts, and resource
allocation i s largely due to: (a) the absence o f clearly identifiedpriorities, based on the cost
o f environmental degradation; (b) the absence o f an integrated system o f reliable data to
provide analytical support to the decision-making process; (c) the lack o f representation o f
vulnerable groups; and (d) the absence o f a formal mechanism for the allocation o f
financial and human resources, according to clearly defined environmental priories linked
to poverty alleviation and social priorities.
17.              Accountability and enforcement and monitoring capacity require urgent
improvement. Accountability i s diluted by: (a) the absence o f clear responsibilities and
capacities among agencies; and (b) the lack o f an effective voice for the poor, stemming
from the lack o f awareness and absence o f sound mechanisms for public participation.
Monitoring capacity i s constrained by a lack o f reliable time series data on the state o f the
environment and natural resources, the nonexistence o f a system o f results-focused
indicators o f environmental quality, and insufficient resources to ensure an adequate
institutional presence in the field. Finally, enforcement has been suboptimal mostly
because enforcement power ultimately rests inthe same ministries that are responsible for
sector development, but also because quality standards still need to be defined in many
areas.
18.              Major reforms are needed to address Tajikistan's institutional weaknesses
and respond to the country's most pressing environmental challenges. One o f the first
actions that the Government should consider developing i s a robust mechanism for setting
priorities, based on the following criteria: (a) the results o f the analysis o f the costs o f
environmental degradation; (b) the distributive impact o f the costs o f environmental
degradation; (c) the population's perceptions, gauged through the conduct o f surveys that
primarily target vulnerable groups; and (d) analysis o f the efficiency and effectiveness o f
environmental policies and o f alternative interventions to reduce the cost o f environmental
degradation.
RevisitingEnvironmentalPriorities
19.              A study was conducted as part o f the CEA to identify the environmental
problems that are associated with the most significant economic costs. This analysis
showed that the costs o f environmental damages are significant in Tajikistan accounting
for about 9.5% o f its GDP in 2006. The highest damage i s from land degradation,
including soil erosion and salinity, the cost o f which accounts for 3.7 % o f the GDP,
followed by natural disasters (1.6% o f GDP) and then costs due to inadequate water

                                               10

supply, sanitation and hygiene (1.5% o f GDP). The cost o f indoor air pollution and
associated health risk i s about 1% o f the GDP; rangeland degradation (0.7 % o f GDP) cost
o f urban outdoor air pollution (0.5 %), lead poisoning (0.2 %) and deforestation (0.2 %).
The above estimates show the urgency in reversing the course of environmental damages
inthe country for sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction.
20.             The analysis found that the land degradation is the principal environmental
problem in the country, the main causes o f which include irrigation-related land
degradation, in particular secondary salinity, water-logging and irrigation-related soil
erosion, soil erosion in rain-fed farmlands, degradation o f summer and winter pastures in
vast mountain areas, and other forms o f land degradation caused by natural disasters and
soil contamination. Although the principal cause o f natural resource losses i s degradation
of agricultural lands, it i s important to mention that all elements o f natural resource
degradation in Tajikistan are interrelated -- causality links often work both ways. Land
degradation eventually causes more land slides and mudflows especially in the sensitive
mountainous areas. Most affected by degradation are village-near pasture lands as well as
bush and tree vegetation. Common causes include ineffective land management and the
lack o f energy resources. Land degradation not only affects agricultural productivity,
biodiversity and wildlife, but also increases the likelihood o f natural hazards, that in turn
cause destruction to limited agricultural assets. The total annual loss, due to land
degradation in Tajikistan, is about 270 million TJS.
21.             The second major environmental damage is from fragile soil structure inthe
mountain area causing natural disasters by way o f mudflows and boulders sliding down the
hills. About 85% of Tajikistan's area is threatened with mudflows and 32% o f the area is
situated in the high mudflow risk zone. Anthropogenic activity, such as deforestation,
irrigation and land use practices, as well as improper grazing systems adoption on the
communnal property lands, increase frequency and magnitude o f floods, landslides,
avalanches, and storms, and intermitant droughts, the total costs o f which i s modestly
estimated to account for about 115 million TJS.
22.             InTajikistan only 93% ofurbanpopulation and 61% ofrural population has
access to improved source o f drinking water. The costs associated with inadequately
protected water supply, sanitation and hygiene include costs o f mortality and morbidity
from Diarrhea, Hepatitis A, Typhoid and Paratyphoid and averting expenditures associated
with household boiling of drinking water.         The cost of health impacts represents an
estimated 95 % o f total mean cost, and averting expenditures about 5 %. While rural areas
account for 70 % o f total cost, urban areas account for the rest 30 The estimated total cost
associated with inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene i s at about 110 Million
TJS.
23.             Indoor air pollution i s mainly due to use o f traditional fuels; acute
respiratory illness in children represents 40% o f cost; respiratory child mortality represents
34%; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality in adult females and ARI morbidity
inadult females represent 13% of cost each. Rural population bears 93% o f the total cost
o f indoor air pollution, reflecting much higher load on poor households with above average
number o f children under 5. The estimated total annual cost of indoor air pollution is at 74
million TJS
24.             Degradation o f rangelands i s due to desertification and denudation o f
vegetation from frequent drought and continuous overgrazing o f lands around the


                                              11

proximity o f the villages.    The communal nature soviet style farming system and the
tragedy o f the commons lead to improper grazing and degradation o f grazing lands.
Annual cost o f rangeland degradation i s estimated at 53 million TJS using two methods:
market value and foregone livestock income from fodder losses.
25.              The damages due to urban air pollution that constitute about 0.5% o f the
GDP are from deterioration in air quality as a result o f particulate matter mainly related to
air pollution from transportation. The mean estimated annual cost o f urban air pollution
due to P M is about 32 million TJS o f which about 88% of the cost is due to mortality, and
the remaining 12% is associated with morbidity. Measured interms of DALYs, mortality
represents 63% and morbidity 37%.
26.              The estimate o f costs associated with lead exposure is based on the loss o f
intelligence quotient and midmental retardation. The estimated annual cost associated with
lead exposure i s at 15 Million TJS. As there i s considerable uncertainty about the data on
lead levels in blood in urban population and rural population in Tajikistan, the estimates
presentedhere are only for the childrenunder 5 inurbanpopulation of the cities with more
than 100 thousand inhabitants.
27.               The costs o f deforestation include direct and indirect use values and non-
use values. The direct use values include costs associated with loss o f fruit trees and wood
lots as fuel-wood production, non-timber products, and tourism and recreation uses. The
nonuse values include option values and existence values. It may be noted that the forest
cover i s only about 3% o f the total geographical area and hence the marginal costs of
deforestation tends be higher inthe country.
28.              Among other environmental problems the Tajikistan Aluminum Plant
(TaAZ) accounts for about 60-70% of all emissions from stationary sources (2 1,899 tons,
or 68.75% o f the total in 2001). A 2002 study found TaAZ responsible for notable fluoride
water pollution inthe region.
29.              Management o f industrial, mining and municipal wastes remains on the
priority list o f environmental problems in Tajikistan. Wastes are mainly generated from
mining o f mineral resources, chemical and cotton production, uranium tailings, building
refuse and municipal wastes. Uncontrolled wastes disposal requires urgent development o f
modern methods to assess, document, and monitor solid waste disposals and processing
and investing inwastes disposal.
30.              The cost o f environmental degradation in Tajikistan is comparable with
other countries with similar income level. Studies o f the cost o f environmental degradation
conducted in Pakistan, a low income country in Asia, and several other low and lower-
middle countries inAsia, Africa and Latin America show that monetary value o f increased
morbidity, mortality and natural resources degradation typically lies from 4% to 10% o f
GDP, compared to 9.5% o f GDP inTajikistan.
31.              Climate change costs were not quantified in the report due to the lack o f
consistent scenarios o f negative impacts. On the qualitative level it i s proved that
increasing temperature and changing precipitation patterns are among the major reasons
for recent extreme weather events in Tajikistan. Changing climate leads to glaciers retreat,
water shortages, increased frequency and magnitude o f natural disasters, as well as alters
hydropower development and increases pressure on agriculture. Human health and
ecosystems will be affected in the long run. Further analysis is needed to estimate annual
losses due to climate change given current uncertainty o f the climate models.

                                               12

32.             The burdeno f these costs falls most heavily on vulnerable groups. The poor
are exposed to higher environmental risks than higher-income groups, and lack the
resources to mitigate those risks. Environmental health impacts often have more severe
repercussions on the poor than on the non-poor, because the latter tend to have more
resources to cope with such events, better access to health services, and better health in
general. Environmental impacts and natural disasters can also result in a loss o f income or
assets that is more detrimental for the livelihoods o f the poor than for those o f the non-
poor.
 Conclusions and recommendations
33.             The analysis revealed that there are opportunities for improving
environmental sector and its performance in the country. The cost of environmental
degradation reveals the focus areas for such an improvement. For the nearest future, major
focus should be on efficient land and water resource management, soil fertility and
moisture conservation which are o f critical importance for the productivity o f agriculture,
the prevention of human healthrisks, and energy security inTajikistan. Inlonger term, the
cost o f environmental degradation will be exacerbated by climate change. Also, the
priorities may be shifted overtime. Therefore, the improvement o f monitoring, information
systems, and forward looking risk analysis are essential. Due to multimedia and
multidisciplinary character o f the underlying problems, there i s a need for robust
interagency coordination. Along with strengthening o f SCSNREP other agencies may also
play an important role, for example: the State Committee for Emergency, the Water
Management Authorities, and the Ministry o f Energy          At the same time, mitigation of
environmental degradation costs should be closely linked with poverty alleviation strategy
o f Tajikistan (PRS).
34.             Immediate measures should include improvement o f land and cropping
system management techniques with appropriate irrigation infrastructure rehabilitation,
where it is viable. This is essential for sustaining and increasing the farm production and,
furthermore, reducing microbiological and chemical contamination o f surface and
groundwater. Appropriate crop diversification and production practices instead o f
continued monocropping practices enhances employment opportunities and i s an important
factor o f poverty alleviation in rural areas. Improved irrigation policy in combination with
improved land management practice will reduce vulnerability to natural disasters. Taking
into account specifics o f Tajikistan, access to potable water and alternative energy sources
like small hydropower will create highest value added with respect to mitigation of the
current and future environmental degradation cost. Also, small hydro and improved stoves
programs are important in reducing indoor air pollution related to solid fuels used for
cooking. These and other recommendations related to general improvement o f institutions
and management are summarized inthe table below.

would provide the largest benefits.

1.1      Economic performanceand environmentalchallenges

Tajikistan i s a small mountainous land locked Central Asian country with an economy that
heavily depends on exports o f cotton, aluminum and hydroelectricity-three              rather
environmentally sensitive sectors and remittances from migrants living abroad3. The
macroeconomic performance has beenimpressive since the end o f the recent civil war; the
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been growing at an average rate o f 8.7 %4 in the last
five years. The country has a population o f about 7 million in 2007, of which about 75%
live inrural areas and are dependent on agriculture. It has a per capita GDP o f $390 which
i s lowest among the 15 former Soviet republics. The population has beengrowing at about
1.3% during 2002-2006 and the percapita income at 5.9 %. Table 1.1 below presents the
summary o f the development indicators in Central Asian countries.

Social indicators are relatively strong in Tajikistan, even admitting existing data gaps and
inconsistencies, although the recent civil conflict might have affected the pace o f progress.
In2005, the life expectancy at birthwas at an average of 66 years. Literacy rates in2000
were as high as 100 % for males and 99 % for females. The net primary and secondary
school enrollment ratios in 2005 were 97 and 80 % respectively. Both infant and child
mortality rates declined over the period 1995 through 2005. The infant mortality rate and
child mortality rate in 2005 were 59 per 1000 live births and 71 per 1000 respectively. In
2005, about 59 % o f the population had access to improved potable water source, which
shows a marginal decline from 61 % in 1995. Access to improved sanitation also fell
marginally from 52 % in 1995 to 51 % in 2004. Although the prevalence of HIV i s less
than 0.1 %, recently there has been an increase in the incidence o f tuberculosis in the
country, increasing from 65 per 100,000 people in 1995 to 198 per 100,000 people in
2005.5

The country's program of structural and institutional reform centers on the following three
pillars (a) reform o f the public sector management, (b) development o f private sector and
attracting investments,and (c) development o f human potential.

Environmental degradation and unsustainable use o f natural resources including land and
water are clearly constraints to sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. With
more than half o f its territory situated above 3,000 meters, the country is particularly
vulnerable to natural disasters. The country's economy deeply suffered from both the
disintegration o f the Former Soviet Union in 1991 with the break down o f the centrally
commanded intricate system o f supply and services and the bitter Civil War that erupted
in 1992. Impoverished by sudden shortages of fuel, income, and food, the population
dependent on the soviet production system that abruptly came to a grinding halt lost their
source o f income, were forced to revert to subsistence practices, which put an extra burden
on the natural resources and the environment o f the country.

The environmental challenges in the country, according to the recent National
Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) are (i)land degradation, including deforestation,
degradation o f vast area o f winter and summer pasturelands and fruit and nuts tree
plantations in mountain areas, arable and irrigated lands; (ii)lack o f improved drinking
water and water quality deterioration; (iii)waste pollution from agriculture and industry;
(iv) deficiencies in sewerage system infrastructure and management; (v) uncollected and
untreated solid waste; (vi) environmental hazards and natural disasters like droughts and
floods; (vii) shortages inenergy supply; and (viii) lack o f environmental education.

The completion and approval of the NEAP in 2006 has brought much attention to the
environmental challenges faced by the country and resulted in a public debate. The recent
National Development Strategy 2015 and the Second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
also recognize the importance o f addressing environmental issues for growth and poverty
reduction. The momentum thus created by these developments provides a window o f
opportunity to review and improve environmental management and policies based on an
analysis o f the performance o f environmental institutions (since the creation o f the
Ministry)and the key environmentalchallenges that Tajikistan is facing. Such analysis will
help the environmental authorities develop policies and interventions that take advantage
of potential win-win opportunities, assess tradeoffs, and find the economic and social
balance between protecting and restoring a deteriorating environment and avoiding
unrealistic regulations that might hinder competitiveness and investment.

1.2. Rationale

The World Bank is supporting policy and institutional reforms in a number o f areas
through the Tajikistan Programmatic Development Policy Credit (PDPC) (Development
Policy Lending) operation. These are aligned with the first two pillars o f Tajikistan's
PRSP: to improve the environment for private sector development, and to improve overall
functioning o f the public sector and the delivery o f key public services. To promote
private sector development, the PDPC program will support measures to reduce the cost o f
doing business, promote transparency o f the privatization process, and assist with
regulatory and institutional reforms in key strategic sectors (aviation, cotton, and energy).
To improve the overall functioning of the public sector and improvements in the delivery
o f public services, the PDPC program will support public sector reforms aimed at

                                             17

improving public sector management, and the efficiency and effectiveness of public
spending. The program will also support reforms ineducation and health sector policies to
improve access, quality, and equity of services.

Under the new Operations Policy (OP/BP 8.60) on Development Policy Lending (DPL) it
i s now requiredthat the Bank determine whether specific country policies supported by the
operation are likely to have significant effects on the country's environment and natural
resources. For policies with likely significant effects, there should be an assessment of the
relevant analytic knowledge o f these effects and of the borrower's systems for reducing
adverse effects and enhancing positive effects associated with the specific policies being
supported. While Environmental Assessments (EAs) undertaken as a part of the Bank's
safeguards process are very project specific, the environmental review of a DPL i s
expected to be much broader, and aimed at building country capacity to mitigate broader
environmental effects resulting from policy reforms. There is much emphasis in the new
policy on undertaking upstream analytic work, such as Country Environmental Analyses
(CEAs) and Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEAS),especially in countries where
Bank is a major driver of the development agenda through DPLs.

Inthe case of Tajikistan, the Bank is supporting reforms inkey sectors like cotton, energy,
and private sector development that may have impacts on environment and natural
resources.    The Bank is also supporting Tajikistan in implementing a community
agriculture development program on watershed basis where Integrated models that enhance
agricultural productivity and address land degradation adapted to conditions prevalent in high
Mountain Regions of Tajikistan. The CPIA scores also indicate that the environmental
institutions are weak in the country. The Country Environmental Analysis is designed to
assess the environmental challenges inthe country, economy environment interactions and
status of environmental institutions and identify a phased approach to fill the gaps and
build capacity of these institutions.

1.3. Objectives

The significance of natural resources in the development process continues to remain
vastly underestimated inpolicy deliberations inTajikistan. Inpart this reflects the absence
of credible quantitative evidence on the economic effects of environmental and resource
degradationand understandingof the critical linkages between broader policy reforms and
their implications for environment and resource base. The objectives of the Tajikistan
Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) are:
         >  To deepen the understanding of the economic costs of country's major
            environmental challenges;
         >   To assess institutional capacity within the country for sound environmental
            management; and
         >  To help strengthen institutions and governance to enhance environmental
            outcomes.

The CEA will improve the analytic basis of indicators with respect to environmental issues
and thus enhance the short term and long term strategic goals of the PRSP. Inaddition to

                                             18

the Government of Tajikistan, the findings of the analysis are also expected to guide
support o f the Bank and other development partners to strengthencapacity in Tajikistan for
sound environmental management.

1.4. Key Issues

The CEA presents an in-depth analysis of critical environmental challenges and
institutional and implementation issues and propose specific recommendations with a
short- to medium-termfocus. The focus o f the environmental challenges i s on the natural
resources and factors o f production that underpin economic growth and include:
environmental health, the degradation o f arable land, the rangelands, and natural disasters.
More specifically, the key areas o f focus are:

Human Capital Losses Associated with Environmental Degradation
Using existing data sources and conventional measurement techniques the CEA assesses
the burden of disease due to environmental factors and computes the economic loss
associated with environmentally related mortality and morbidity. The analysis includes
(but not restricted to) losses resulting from: water-borne disease; poor sanitation; indoor air
pollution; outdoor air pollution and lead poisoning.

Soil Degradation
Agriculture remains Tajikistan's principle occupation and accounts for approximately 24
% of GDP in 2006. Only 6% o f the land area is arable; cotton is the most important crop.
There is abundant evidence o f stagnating yields and widespread degradation o f the soils on
which the agricultural sector depends, due to improper land use practices and adoption o f
monocropping, system. Salinity and water logging, both partly a consequence o f profligate
irrigation methods, and faulty drainage and heavy machnary usage, remain major threats to
the agricultural sector's productive potential. The CEA quantifies the economic loss
attributable to soil degradation (including salinity and water logging), as well as
consequences of sedimentation leading to silting up o f reservoirs reducing their capacities
and silting up o f canal and drainage systems and/or nutrient loss de to excewss water flow
and leaching..

RangelandDegradation
Natural pastures in Tajikistan occupy more than 3.5 million hectares. The rangelands are
an important economic resource that can be efficiently.harnessed for expanding and
sustaining livestock population, large pastoral communities and the country's increasingly
vulnerable biodiversity. Estimates suggest that much o f the poor capcacity and quality
rangeland i s threatened by poor stocking and improper management and restoration o f the
natural vegetation. InTajikistan, about 85% o f the pastureland has beenovergrazed around
the immediate vicinity o fthe villages leaving farthest pastur lands unutilized/underutilized,
so the potential profitability o f livestock operations is declining, and desertification is
increasing. The problem i s particularly widespread in valleys and near villages o f the
Khatlon and inthe Sughdregions. (NEAP 2006). The CEA quantifies the economic losses
o f unsustainable use o f the rangelands.




                                               19

Forest Resources
Wooded forests occupy a relatively small proportion o f the land area inTajikistan (some 3
%), but nevertheless play a vital role in the country's economy. Forests remain an
important source of fuel wood, grazing land, livelihood and government revenue. Forests
also provide multiple ecological-services such as water shed protection, soil protection,
biodiversity habitat and play a vital role in assuring eco-system resilience (Le. stability).
The reduction of wooded forest area and low tree density exacerbated the soil erosion and
mudflow causing natural disasters in 1992-1999. Since the 1970s, the area o f Tajikistan's
forestlands did not vary significantly, although the average wood stock has been reducing
and now it i s around 70% comparing to the former period. (Tajikistan 2002. State o f the
Environment Report). The CEA assesses the economic losses due to deforestation using
the available data.

Natural Disasters
Poorer green cover and vegetation and fragile soil structure o f the mountain area lead to
incidence o f dozens o f landslides, hundreds o f mudflows and avalanches in Tajikistan
annually. The processes o f deep soil erosion, gully formation, land slides, and deep
depressions characterize many areas. About 80% o f the reported natural disasters occur
within the Gissar-Alai mountain system. Also, some 85% of Tajikistan's area is threatened
with mudflows and rock boulders rolling down the fragile mountain area. About 32% o f
the valley area is situated in the high mudflow and boulder move risk zone.6 The CEA
focuses on 2-3 types of disasters directly related to anthropogenic activity (indiscriminate
felling o f forest trees and defective land use pattern o f agricultural practices) causing the
largest costs to society by way o f flooding and land slides. There i s therefore a very high
potential for reductions indisaster impacts.

Climate Change7
Temperature rise leads to glaciers melting that i s potentially disastrous to water supply in
Central Asia. It alters development o f major sectors o f the Tajikistan economy including
agriculture, water and electricity supply through deterioration in the river flows and
consequent hydropower potential reducing the irrigation potential inthe most affected river
basins. Valuable tugai ecosystem could degrade because o f shortage o f water resources,
reduction in vegetative cover leading to food shortages, increase in temperature, and
enhaced fire risks. Land degradation could exacerbate due to longer dry periods and higher
temperature in spring and summer. Adaptation policy suggests harmonized approach to
soil and water conservation int eh uppercatchment, efficient and rational water use
including potable water supply, effective irrigation and hydropower development.

1.5. Methodologyand Approach

The analytical framework for the study uses both primary and secondary data sources, and
i s based on three types o f analyses:

                                                  20

Cost of Environmental Degradation: A systematic exercise using state-of-the-art
methodology is undertaken to assess the roots and economic costs o f environmental
degradation. This will help the government and other stakeholders to rank environmental
concerns inTajikistan, and identify the sectoral sources from which these concerns stem.

Policy, Legislative and RegulatoryAnalysis: The CEA provides an analysis o f the laws,
policies and regulations applicable to the environment and sustainable development. This
includes stocktaking o f existing laws, policies and regulations as well as an assessment o f
their effectiveness and relevance to Tajikistan's current challenges and environmental
priorities. A gap analysis i s undertaken to determine legal, policy and regulatory areas that
need strengthening and provide suggestions as to the mechanisms for policy formulation,
policy goal setting and trade-offs, and cost-effective measures for achieving desired
outcomes.

Assessmentof Institutional Capacity, Incentivesand Constraints:Historically, the
institutional framework for environmental management inTajikistan has been inconsistent,
the policy framework has lacked an integrated approach, and implementation is also weak.
These problems have beencompounded by an extended period o fpolitical instability,
misplaced prioritizationunder the constrained budgetswhere environmental issues received
minimal attention from the government. The result has been an often changing and highly
centralized institutional and policy frameworks that suffer from institutional overlaps, lack
o f adequate resources and lack o f sectoral coordination.

The CEA assesses the environmental management capacity of public agencies at national
and sub-national levels. This i s based on review of existing capacity in terms o f plans,
processes and personnel for environmental management in key institutions. The review
specifically examines mechanisms and incentive structures for integrating environmental
priorities in economic and sector-wide programs such as presence of well-resourced
environmental units in key ministries, application o f economic instruments, and capacity
for environmental decision making and inclusively articulated participatory resource
management in municipalities and district assemblies. The CEA identifies gaps in
institutional capacity and recommends measures for restructuring and strengthening based
on stakeholder discussions and available best practice. This will be the basis for the
institutional reforms inthe PDPC (DPL).

Environmental Licenses and Permits: More specifically, the CEA also examines the
issue o f environmental licenses and permits in the context o f broader reforms inthe area o f
licenses and permits supported under the PDPC. The aim o f reducing the time to set up a
business can place undue pressures for environmental clearances, which in some cases
need time. The staffing in the environmental agencies is also assessed to meet with the
demands for a more timely delivery o f initial clearances and for the follow up monitoring.

Privatization: Privatizationof certain environmentally sensitive industries (such as cement
and aluminum) could have serious environmental implications if there i s no adequate
framework to deal with legacies o f past pollution. This inmany transition countries has in
fact ledto prolonged litigation with adverse impacts on the privatization process itself. The
CEA examines the current framework to deal with legacies o f past pollution or how to
build this into the privatization efforts. Experiences from other countries are drawn up to
recommend the legal framework so that mistakes of other countries are not repeated.

1.6. Structureof the Report

This report is arranged in seven sections. The first section develops the country context,
the key environmental challenges, the rationale, objective and methodology followed.
Section I1 provides the overall estimates o f social and economic costs o f environmental
damage in Tajikistan. Section I11 presents annual costs associated health losses linked to
environmental degradation, including inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene,
indoor/outdoor air pollution and exposure to lead. Estimates o f annual losses due to
degradation o f natural resources are presented in Section IV. They include land
degradation due to irrigation, secondary salinity, water logging and irrigation-related soil
erosion, soil erosion in rain fed farmlands, degradation o f pasture lands, deforestation and
related loss o f biodiversity, and losses due to natural disasters in the country. Costs o f
climate change and hydropower development problems are reflected in the same section.
An assessment of the existing institutions and the regulatory framework and the issues in
enforcement o f the policies and regulations i s presentedin Section V. The Section VI has
an account o f the organization structure and environmental governance inthe country. The
final section has the conclusions and policy recommendations.

11. Cost of Environmental Degradation

Environmental pollution, degradation o f natural resources, natural disasters, and
inadequate environmental services, such as improved water supply and sanitation, impose
costs to society in the form o f ill health, lost income, and increased poverty and
vulnerability. This section provides overall estimates o f social and economic costs o f
environmental damage inTajikistan.

The estimated total cost of environmental damage inthe country is about 690 Million TJS
per year (Table 2.1 and Figure 2.1), accounting for about 9.5 % of the GDP in 2006. The
costs were estimated for eight different damage categories. Among the eight categories o f
damages, costs of damages from land degradation, including soil erosion, loss o f fertility
and salinity was the highest, 39.3 % o f the total cost o f damages (3.7 % o f the GDP);
followed by cost o f natural disasters (115 Million TJS) and then damages due to
inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene (112 Million TJS). The cost o f damages
due to indoor air pollution was 74 MillionTJS; rangeland degradation 53 MillionTJS; cost
of urban outdoor air pollution 33 Million TJS and lead poisoning 17 Million TJS. The
smallest cost category i s for deforestation at 15 Million TJS. This however does not
account for loss o f wild berries, fruits, and nuts having high food value, medicinal plants,
inthe mountainous forest areadue to lack o fofficial data.

The analysis shows that environmental degradation causes significant damages to the
economy accounting for as high as 9.5 % o f the GDP o f which land degradation alone
accounts for 3.8 % (Figure 2.2) followed by cost o f natural disasters at 1.6 % o f the GDP.
The other cost categories are damages from inadequate water supply, sanitation and
hygiene (1.5% o f     the GDP); indoor air pollution (1%); urban air pollution including
outdoor air pollution cost from particulate matter and cost o f lead poisoning (0.7%). Land
degradation alone shares for 39 % o f the total cost o f environmental degradation in the
country followed by natural disasters (Figure 2.2). Lack o f adequate supply o f improved
water, sanitation and hygiene and indoor and urban air pollution together accounted about
35 % o f the total damages.

Inadditionto the mean estimates, "low" and "high" estimates ofannual costs are presented
inTable 2.1. The range for water supply, sanitation and hygiene is in large part associated
with uncertainties regarding estimates of diarrheal child mortality and morbidity. In the
case o f urban air pollution and natural disasters two different valuation techniques for
estimating the social cost o f mortality have been applied which yielded the "low" and
"high" estimates. The range for indoor air pollution i s mainly from the uncertainty about
the exposure level to indoor smoke from the use of fuel wood, and thus a range has been
applied for the level o f health risk. The range for agricultural soil degradation i s associated
with uncertainty of yield losses from salinity. The range for deforestation is associated
with the uncertainty of the use and non-use benefits o f forest and the range for lead
exposure is mainly related to the uncertainty o f loss o f lifetime income due to the loss o f
cognitive ability.

 A survey on the awareness of the public on environmental problems in Tajikistan showed
 that the general public considers land degradation, natural disasters and problems due to
 inadequate supply o f improved, sanitation and hygiene as the major environmental
 problems in the country (Table 2.1), receiving highest rankings.          These results are
 consistent with the study estimates of costs o f environmental damages presentedin Table
 2.2.

 The costs of damages associated with environmental health are distributed unevenlyacross
 the population. Figure 2.4 presents estimated costs per capita due to exposure of general
 population to environmental health risks. Losses due to outdoor air pollution and lead
 poisoning losses were estimated for the inhabitants o f the cities with population over 100
 thousand; costs o f inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene costs were estimated
 for the whole population of Tajikistan; and indoor air pollution costs were estimated for
 the households that use solid fuel for cooking (about 40 % of households). Outdoor urban
 air pollution has the highest cost on a per person basis followed by damages due to indoor
 air pollution. Among the estimated cost items, inadequate water supply and sanitation has
 the lowest cost on a percapita basis. However, when comparing these estimates it should
 be noted that the entire population o f Tajikistan is included in the estimation o f damages

                                              25

due to inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene. Inthe case of indoor air pollution
the estimate is based on about 40 % of all Tajikistan (households are considered to bear
indoor air pollution losses) but only 46 % o f urban population was analyzed for the
outdoor air pollution exposure.

The analysis shows that while almost all of the rural population is potentially experiencing
losses from inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene, as well as from indoor air
pollution, data on the proportion of urban population affected i s less reliable. Similarly
data on ambient air quality are available for only 46 % o f the urban population and the
analysis did not cover the remaining 54 % o f the urban population although they suffer
both from outdoor air pollution and inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene. The
poorer sections o f the population who live inbig cities and use solid fuel for cooking, seem
to be more affected by the environmental damages; those. A more detailed analysis would
be neededto estimate the distributional impacts of such damages.

The cost of environmental degradation in Tajikistan is comparable with other countries
with similar income level. Studies of the cost of environmental degradation conducted in
Pakistan, a low income country in Asia, and several low and lower-middle countries in
Asia, Africa and Latin America show that monetary value of increased morbidity,
mortality and natural resources degradationtypically lies from 4 to 10 per cent of GDP,
comparedto 9.5 % of GDP inTajikistan.

The situation looks even more consistent across different countries if one compares health
cost o f environmental degradation. In all the selected countries they vary among 3-4 % of
GDP. InTajikistan health cost o f environmental damage is at 3.25 % of GDP. It includes
costs of inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene, cost o f indoor and outdoor air pollution,
and health cost o f lead exposure.

111.EnvironmentalHealth Losses in Tajikistan

3.1. Urban Air Pollution

UNECE 2004 indicates that approximately 119,000 tons o f harmful substances were
emitted into the atmosphere in 2003. Industriesand energy utilities together accounted for
about 34,000 tons o f emissions, o f which Tajik aluminum plant alone accounted for about
22,000 tons. More recent estimates show that automobile emission is becoming a major
source of air pollution in the cities. This i s because o f the growing number o f registered
vehicles, the poor quality o f fuel and a large existing fleet of old motor vehicles (65% o f
the fleet is 8 to 30 years old) (UNECE, 2004)). In 2005, pollution from automobiles
contributed as much as 83% o f total atmospheric emissions or 170 thousand tons. This is
more than twice o f the emissions estimated in2000. Other sources of outdoor air pollution
are dust storms and burning o f waste products.

There is substantial research evidence from around the world that outdoor urban air
pollution has significant negative impacts on public health and results in premature deaths,
chronic bronchitis, and respiratory disorders. A comprehensive review o f such studies i s
provided in Ostro (2004) and Cohen (2004). The air pollutant that has shown the strongest
association with these health endpoints i s particulate matter (PM)*, and especially
particulates o f less than 10 microns indiameter (PM 10) or smaller.

The estimated cost of health effects from urban air pollution in this analysis is based on
Particulate Matter (PM) and lead exposure. This section first discusses cost o f exposure to
P M pollution. Lead exposure i s discussed inthe latter half o f the section.

ParticulateMatter

The mean estimated annual cost of urban air pollution due to P M is about 32 million TJS
o f which about 88 % o f the cost i s due to mortality, and the rest 12 % i s associated with
morbidity (Figure 3.1). Measured in terms o f DALYs, mortality represents 63 % and
morbidity 37 %.




 Also called as suspended particulates.

The focus o f this study is on the health effects o f fine particulates (PM10 and PM2.5).
Three main steps were followed to quantify the health impacts from air pollution. First, the
pollutants are identified and its ambient concentration measured. Second, the number o f
people exposed to the pollutant and its concentration is calculated. The third step then i s to
estimate the health impacts using data collected and based on epidemiological assessments.
Once the health impacts are quantified, the value o f this damage as a% o f GDP can be
estimated.

The present analysis covers only Dushanbe and Khujand, the two cities with population
over 100 thousand. Although urban population in the other smaller cities are also exposed
to ambient air pollution, due to the lack o f monitoring data and estimated concentrations
they were not included in the analysis. Total urban population exposed to air pollution i s
about 0.8 million or 46 % o f total Tajikistan population in2006.

Dushanbe is the capital of Tajikistan with a population o f about 0.65 million. It is located
inthe central part o fTajikistan onthe southern slope of Gissar mountainridge inthe valley
at the height o f about 800 metersabove sea level.

 State o f the Environment in Dushanbe Report, 2001 (CEROI, 2001) reports that in the
 1980s concentration o f TSP in the atmosphere was about 1.5-3 times the Maximum
Allowable Concentration (MAC), with emissions at about 0.15 mg/m3 per annum. The
average observed TSP concentration in 2001 was 2.2 times the M A C or about 0.3 mg/m3,
which indicates that the TSP concentration fell since the 1980s. (Also, it is estimated that
on average TSP concentration has more than halved since then (CEROI, 2001)). Then
applying default coefficient 0.5 for the PMlO fraction in TSP (Larson et al, 1999) annual
average PMlO concentration i s about 80 ug/m3. Using the econometric model developed
by the World Bank for the world cities with population above 100 thousand, we have
estimated the annual average PMlO concentration in Dushanbe at 59 ug/m3.' Similarly
using the World Bank model the estimated annual PMlO annual average concentration in
Khujandi s 84 ug/m3.

Usingthe information from Annex 3 about applicable concentration-response coefficients
that link annual average P M pollution with additional cardiopulmonary mortality and
various morbidity end-points (see Annex 3), the annual health effects o f ambient

                                                               30

 particulate air pollution in Tajikistan are presented in Table 3.1.1. Urban air particulate
 pollution i s estimated to cause around 420 premature deaths annually. Estimated new
 cases o f chronic bronchitis are about 230 per year.           Annual hospitalizations due to
 pollution are estimated at close to 630, and emergency room visits/outpatient
 hospitalizations at 12.5 thousand per year. Cases o f less severe health impacts are also
 presented in Table 3.1.1 In terms of annual DALYs lost, mortality accounts for an
 estimated 63 %, chronic bronchitis around 10 % o f the total, Restricted Activity Days
 (RADS)for 12%, and respiratory symptoms for 9 %.

 Estimated Cost of Health Impacts

 The estimated annual cost o f health damages due to urban air pollution is presented in
 Table 3.1.2. Cost o f mortality i s based on the Human Capital Approach (HCA) and the
 Value o f Statistical Life (VSL), ranges from 3 to 55 million TJS. The methodology i s
 discussed in annex 4.

 The measure o f the welfare cost o f morbidity is often based on the willingness-to-pay
 (WTP) to avoid or reduce the risk o f illness. It i s often found to be several times higher
 than the cost o f medical treatment and the value o f time losses (Cropper and Oates 1992),
 and reflect the value that individuals place on avoiding pain and discomfort. There are
 however not a sufficient number o f WTP studies from Central Asia. So the Cost-Of-
 Illness (COI) approach (mainly medical cost and value o f time losses) has been applied to
 estimate morbidity (see Annex 3 for explanation).

3.2 Lead

The problem o f lead pollution is quite serious in Tajikistan. The main reason is that
transportation sector contributes about 70 % o f air pollution (Dimitrov, 2004) and gasoline
i s still leaded. Another source o f lead pollution i s unregulated wastes incineration.

Emission from automobiles (transportation fleet) is the major contributor o f air pollution in
Tajikistan. There has been substantial decline in industrial production in the country since
1990s, which led to a change in the sources o f air pollution in favor of the automobiles.
Figure 3.2.1 presents composition o f air pollution from stationary and mobile sources in
2000 and 2005. It may be noted that in 2005 emissions from stationary sources (industry,
power plants, etc.) remain at the same lower level as in 2000, while emissions from the
transportation sector grew significantly in2000-2005 period.

The Environmental Agency. reported that annual increment o f the automobile fleet in
                          -         -
recent years has gone up at a rate o f around 20 % annually. Inparticular, in 2005 the total
number of vehicles was 164,000, which increased to 209,204 in2006 and then to 234,189
in the beginning of 2007 (Environmental Agency, Tajikistan 2007). The average age of
the automobile fleet is 10-15 years, most vehicles purchased in 1996-2000. The prevalence
o f low incomes leads to continuous ageing o f the automobile fleet, and which inturn leads
to increases in the volume o f emissions. Most o f automobile service stations do not have

Estimated annual lead emission i s 1 kg o f lead per vehicle. A vehicle using 1000 liters o f '
fuel on the average emits 200 kg o f carbon monoxide, 1 kg o f soot and solid pollutants and
200-400 grams o f lead and the average consumption o f fuel i s 10-12 liter per 1OOkm. Lead
content in imported gasoline i s not measured. Local experts hint that up to 60 % o f
gasoline i s imported illegally and without certification.

The estimated annual cost associated with lead exposure ranges from 14 to20 Million TJS
per year, with a mean o f 15 MillionTJS. This estimate is based on lead exposure from all
sources (leaded gasoline, industry and possible other sources such as water, soil, paint and
food) for the children under 5 living in cities with more than 100 thousand inhabitants,
totaling nearly 0.8 million people or about 50 % o f the urban population in Tajiki~tan.~
Because o f data limitations, only the most significant components o f total loss, burden o f
IQ (89%)andthecostofmildmentalretardation(MMR)(11%)couldbeestimated.
   loss
There is no information available on the current Blood Lead Levels (BLL) for the urban
population in Tajikistan. The estimated cost o f lead exposure i s therefore based on Blood
Lead BLL measurements in children in Central Asian countries and in Russia with similar
gasoline characteristics.

The methodology used to estimate environmental burden from lead exposure is described
in(Fewtrell et al, 2003). Since there were several studies available (see Annex 3), a single
weighted mean level o f lead in blood (BLL) was generated at 6.6 ug/dl in children and 4.0
ug/dl in adults. These average levels are close to the lowest threshold (Le., 5 ug/dl) for
health effects reported in the Annex 3. Nevertheless, part o f the population may have a
BLL well above this threshold. This is reflected inthe standard deviation reported by the
studies.

The adjusted BLL and the range instandard deviation are applied inthe model to estimate
population BLL. The result suggests that an estimated 60-62 % o f the children and 35-37
% o f the adults have BLL > 5 ug/dl and an estimated 1 % o f the children and no adults
have BLL > 20 ug/dl.



9This corresponds to the population for which the cost o f PM pollution was estimated.

Loss o f intelligence (IQ loss) has been identified as the most important impact o f BLL on
health (See Annex 3 for literature on health impacts of BLL). Following the assumption o f
a normal distributiono f I Q inthe population, the number o f children with MMR from lead
exposure i s estimated by multiplying the estimated number of children with elevated BLL
by the children share with IQ of 70-73.5 points. The estimated annual loss o f intelligence
from lead exposure i s presented in Table 3.2.2, totaling about 21 thousand IQ points and
120cases o fMMR.

The estimated population at risk o f MMR is summedfor different I Q bands (Annex 3) and
thenmultipliedby the regional MMRadjustment ratio, which is 1.53 for Euro B, the WHO
sub-region where Tajikistan i s part.

Other negative outcomes o f lead exposure (increased blood pressure, gastrointestinal
effects and anemia) were not quantified due to combination o f two factors: significant1Y

MMR is linked with the loss of 36.1 % (0.361 coefficient equal to disability weight for
DALYs loss estimation) o fDALYs and lifetimeincome. Although there is some indication
that MMR i s associated with lower life expectancy, additional evidence i s needed to
quantify this association (Pruss-Ustun et al., 2004). MMR-related lifetime income loss was
estimated as 2 million TJS.

I Q losses were also linked to the loss o f lifetime income. Cost o f I Q losses are estimated
based on expected lifetime income losses, assuming a 1.3-1.9 % decline in income for
every one point loss in I Q based on studies in the United States (Schwartz 1994 and

The DALYs lost due to MMR were estimated using DALYs tables o f the WHO
(www.who.int/evidence/nbd).Thus, the DALYs lost due to MMR is estimated at 1200.

We have presented above, a very conservative estimation of the cost o f health impacts o f
exposure to lead pollution. It may be noted that this estimate does not include MMR health
expenses (Le. doctor visits, medication cost and time losses o f care givers) and reduced life
expectancy due to MMR. Further, it doesn't include cost of other health effects related to
lead exposure such as elevated blood pressure, gastroenterological effects, and anemia. It
should also be noted that the estimated costs are only for the children under 5 inthe cities
with urbanpopulationmore than 100thousand inhabitants, and that the estimates are based
on BLL measurements from Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Russia. In the absence o f data,
there is a considerable uncertainty about BLL in the urban population as a whole and the
rural population in Tajikistan. Hence it i s necessary to undertake new studies o f BLL in
children and adults to provide a more accurate estimate o f health effects and their costs.

Analysis o f urban air pollution costs suggests that the focus should be on regulating PM,
and particularly on PM2.5, which i s most associated with health effects. Also, action
should be taken to examine the outstanding sources o f lead pollution, including lead in
gasoline and lead in water and food to develop a plan for the phase out o f all such
emissions where justified. The government should devote enough resources to ensure that
I&Mprogram is effective. The record in the past has not been good and this is an area
where cost effective reductions in emissions can be made. Other options to be considered
i s further introduction o f abatement technologies at major polluting industries (Tajik
Aluminum plant) and promoting establishment o f warning systems and emergency plans
for locations most vulnerable to catastrophic life-threatening pollution.

3.3. Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene

As UNECE, 2004 indicates, originally the quality of ground water, which is the major
source o f drinking water in Tajikistan, was very high. Over the years industrial pollution,
municipal discharges and agricultural pollution related to heavy pesticides use and lack o f
drainage on irrigated lands resulted in the substantial loss of water quality. However,

''This reflects a lower and upper bounds of estimated income losses. An annual discount rate of 3 percent
and a real increase in annual incomeof 2 percent is applied. A 0.5 percentagepoint income loss attributed to
a reducedlikelihoodo f labor force participationfrom a decline in IQnot included because o f inadequate
                                                                    i s

                                                     35

according to the to the latest Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey for Tajikistan, MICS 2005,
only 93 % o f urban population and 61 % of rural population has access to improved
source o f drinking water (piped water, public tap, borehole/ tubewell, protected well,
protected spring or rainwater). In GBAO and Khatlon Oblast only 52-55 % of population
has this access. As for sanitation, 97 % o f urban population and 92 % o f rural population
have access to improved sanitation (connected to public service or has a septic tank).

Inadequate quantity and quality o f potable water supply, sanitation facilities and practices,
and hygiene conditions are associated with various illnesses both in adults and children.
The major health effects o f inadequate water quality and quantity, sanitation facilities and
practices, and hygiene are diarrheal morbidity and mortality.l3 While diarrheal illness is
generally not as serious as some other waterborne illnesses, it i s more common and affects
a larger number o f people. WHO estimates that 90 YOo f diarrheal illness i s attributable to
these factors (WHO 2002).

Diarrhealmortality and morbidity

Basis for diarrheal mortality estimation is total child mortality. Tajikistan has in general
relatively highchild mortality, although the estimates are quite uncertain. According to the
latest Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey for Tajikistan, MICS 2005, mortality among
children under 5 i s 79 per 1000 live births (http://www.who.int/whosis/en/index.html).
Similar estimate o f child mortality in 2000 was 126 deaths for 1000 live births (MICS,
2000). The main reason for uncertainty and year-to-year variation in the estimates i s that
only 88 % o f birthsare registered(MICS, 2005).

Table 3.3.1 presents the estimated health effects from inadequate water, sanitation and
hygiene. Details o f the procedure are in the Annex 3. The estimates are based on the
background health data, taking into account the WHO estimate that 90 % o f diarrheal
illness is attributable to water, sanitation and hygiene. % o f diarrheal cases among children
under 5 is estimated from MICS, 2000, and inthe age group older than 5 is estimated from
% o f cases among children (MICS 2000) and the ratio of cases among children under-5to
the population above 5 years of age. The same method was applied to estimation of the
treated cases when only % o f treated cases among children under 5 was available from
MICS 2000. The latter ratio i s from the international sources discussed in the Baseline
Health Data section.

Although the share o f rural population in Tajikistan i s about 74 %, estimated number o f
cases o f diarrheal child mortality i s about 10 % higher because the share o f children inthe
population i s substantially higher in rural areas. The larger share o f children in the rural
population, low public awareness of the health benefits o f drinking boiled water and poor
access to energy are also determinants o f higher diarrheal illness in children inrural areas.
The estimated number o f cases o f diarrheal illness in children under-5 is about 3.5 times
higher inrural areas.

 DALYs lost from diarrheal illness (mortality and morbidity) is presented in Table 3.3.2
 (see Annex 3 for the details of the analysis). About 85 % of the DALYs are from diarrheal
 child mortality.




 Annual cost of diarrheal mortality and morbidity from inadequate water, sanitation and
 hygiene is estimated at 30 million TJS in urban areas and 72 million TJS in rural areas
 (Table 3.3.3). The cost of diarrhealchild mortality is based on the humancapitalapproach
 (HCA) discussed in the Annex 3.             The cost of morbidity includes the cost of illness
 (medical treatment, medicines, and value of lost time). About 30-35 % of these costs are
 associated with the value of time lost to illness (including care giving), and 65-70 % are
 from cost of treatment and medicines.




 Hepatitis A, Typhoid and Paratyphoid

 Number of recorded cases of hepatitis A and typhoid/paratyphoidin Tajikistan over the
 period 2000 to 2005 are presentedinTable 3.3.4. There were about 3122 cases of typhoid
 and 7834 hepatitis cases per year during the above period. The total estimated annual cost
 associatedwith hepatitisand typhoid is 4.2 million TJS (Table 3.3.5).

Averting Expenditures

In the presence of perceived health risks, people often take averting measures to avoid
these risks. Ifpeople perceive there i s a risk o f illness from the municipal water supply, or
from other sources o f water supply they use, some o f them are likely to purchase bottled
water for drinking purposes, or boil their water. These averting expenditures associated
with the purchase of bottled water and boiling the water account for the costs of health
risks. However, MICS 2005 reports that only less than 1% of population inTajikistan use
bottled water. Hence the averting expenditures associated with the purchase o f bottled
water have not been included in computation o f costs o f health risks. According to local
surveys, nearly 30 % o f households in Tajikistan boil their drinking water, either all the
time or sometimes (Box 3.3.1).             The estimated annual cost of boiling water for those
households i s 3-7 Million TJS per year.

Box 3.3.1: Boilingof Drinking Water in Tajikistan

Recent health survey of several districts of Dushanbe city done by one of the local primary health clinics has
shown that up to 30 % of city inhabitants boil their drinking water. The above %age is expected to grow with
increase in household income and level of education. Experts of sanitary-epidemiological units agree that
this number is not more than 30% inother cities and towns of the country.

The share of population that boils drinking water in rural area is also around 30 %. The 2006 household
survey in four jamoats of Kulob region (Ziraki, Zarbdor, Daganaand Kulob) show that only 25-30 % of rural
population boil drinking water. It increases to about 40-50 % among the quintile of the population that is
richest and the most educated. Traditionally, local people often boil water for tea depending on the seasons;
                               .
overall demand for hot drinks is lower in summer.However, very often people mix tea and raw water during
the day and this could affect the results o f the survey and lead to overestimation of the share o f population
that boils drinking water.

Table 3.3.6 presentsthe data usedto estimate the annual cost o f boiling drinking water. It
i s assumed that the average daily consumption o f drinking water per person i s 0.5-1-0liters
among households that use boiled water. Residential cost o f energy i s estimated based on
data from experts, using the average stove efficiency i s for natural gas and wood fuel.

The total estimated averting expenditures ranges from 3 to 7 million TJS (Table 3.3.7) per
year. This is about 5 % o f the total estimated annual cost associated with inadequate water
supply, sanitation and hygiene.

o f areas on benefit cost grounds as well on grounds o f benefiting the poor. For water
supply and sanitation, improvements in facilities in rural areas yield benefits in excess of
costs under most assumptions. In urban areas the focus should be on drinking water
monitoring and rehabilitationo f pipedwater supply and sewage systems. The programs are
justified on the grounds that the benefits are concentrated primarily among the poor.
Hygiene programs have estimated benefits far in excess o f costs and should receive the
highest priority. The same applies for programs to encourage disinfection o f drinking
water.

3.4. Indoor Air Pollution

WHO (2002b) estimates that 1.6 millionpeople die each year globally due to indoor smoke
from the household use o f traditional fuels. The most common o f such fuels are wood,
agricultural residues, animal dung, charcoal, and in some countries coal. The strongest
l i n k s between indoor smoke and health are for lower respiratory infections, Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and for cancer o f the respiratory system. O f all
the respiratory diseases associated with indoor smoke, lower respiratory infections account
for about 37.5 %, 22 % are COPD, and cancer o f the respiratory system account for about
1.5 % globally (WHO 2002b).

Indoor air pollution i s associated with use o f traditional fuels (mainly cotton stalks in
Tajikistan). About 50% o f rural population and 7% o f urban population use solid fuel for
cooking inTajikistan (MICS, 2005).

Desai et a1 (2004) provides a review o f research studies from around the world that have
assessed the magnitude o f health effects from indoor air pollution from solid fuels. The
odds ratios for acute respiratory illness (ARI) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) are presented in the Table 3.4.1. The ratios represent the risk o f illness for those
who are exposed to indoor air pollution compared to the risk for those who are not
exposed. The range of "low" to "high" ratios reflects the review by Desai et a1(2004), and
have in this section been applied to young children under the age o f five years (for ARI)

Table 3.4.1presentsthe estimatedhealtheffects from indoor air pollutionthat include ARI
mortality and morbidity among children under 5, COPD mortality and morbidity among
women over 30, and ARI morbidityamong womenover 30. Details of the procedure are in
the Annex 3. The estimates are based on the backgroundhealth data on ARI and COPD
prevalence available from MICS, 2005 and international sources (Annex 3), taking into
account odds ratios presented in Table 3.4.1. % of ARI cases among children under 5 is
estimated from MICS, 2005, and in the age group older than 5 is estimated from % of
cases among children (MICS 2005) and the ratio of cases among children under-5 to the
populationabove 5 years of age. The same methodwas appliedto estimationof the treated
cases when only % of treated cases among children under 5 was available from MICS
2005. The latter ratio is from the international sources discussed in the Baseline Health
Data Table (Annex 3).

About 13 % of the cost of morbidity related to indoor air pollution is associated with
COPD, and 87 % with ARI." Mortality due to COPD and ARI accounts for about 47 % of
the total cost, and morbidity about 53 %.

In order to estimate the cost of COPD mortality for adults, the Value of Statistical Life
(VSL) is used as the upper bound and HCA as the lower bound (Annex 3). Inthe case of
children, HCA is usedto estimatethe cost of mortality. The cost of morbidity includesthe
cost of illness (medical treatment and value of time lost due to illness). The estimated
healthimpactsof indoor pollutioninrural and urbanareas are presentedinTable 3.4.2.

 The estimated total annual cost o f indoor air pollution ranges from 50 to 98 million TJS
 with a mean cost at 74 million TJS (Tables 3.4.3). The total costs accounted for about 1 %
 o f GDP in 2006. As presentedin Figure 3.4.1, acute respiratory illness (ARI) in children
 represents 40 % of cost; respiratory child mortality represents 34 %; chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease (COPD) mortality in adult females and ARI morbidity in adult females
 represent 13 % o f cost each. Rural population bears 93 % o f the total cost of indoor air
 pollution.

  So ruralpoor are predominantly affected with indoor air pollution andbear major costs.

 Deteriorating situation with domestic energy use requires urgent measures for negative
 health impact mitigation. The interventions could include promotion o f cleaner fuels use
 in areas that predominantly use solid fuel for cooking, and implement actions to improve
 availability and access to solid fuel users in a safe and cost-effective manner. Development
 o f small hydro power stations also could be mentionedas a solution for meetingpopulation
 needs in the short term.       Consistent use o f improved stoves proved to be an effective
 approach given governmental support and promotion o f the program.
 3.5. Other Important Aspects Of EnvironmentalPollutionInTajikistan

 3.5.1 Tajikistan Aluminum plant

 The Tajik Aluminumplant (TaAZ) is the largest aluminum manufacturing plant in Central
 Asia. It i s located in Tursunzade (Khatlonskaya Oblast), in the south-western part o f
 Tajikistan. Its capacity i s about half billion tones o f aluminum per year and it consumes
 40% o f the country's electrical powert6. As these sources report, in 2001, TaAZ was
 operating at 25% capacity (producing 113,000 tons), down from 86.5% capacity in 1990
 (producing 450,000 tons, the closest it has come to full capacity utilization). The $210
 million earned in export revenues constituted 53% o f total export receipts for the year. In
 2002, TaAZ's output increased to 307,000 tons, and plans are for it to reach 346,000 tons
 annual output by 2005. Almost all o f its output i s exported. The plant directly employs
 12,000 to 14,000, and indirectly supports a community o f 100,000. Thus TaAZ operation
 i s linked to overstressed hydropower consumption in Tajikistan and adds to the already
 tensedrelations with neighboring countries.

 As UNECE, 2004 indicates the city o f Tursunzade where aluminum plant is located, is
 particularly affected by air pollution from stationary sources, which account for 75.7% o f
 total air pollution. The TaAZ accounts for about 60-70% o f all emissions from stationary
 sources (21,899 tons, or 68.75% o f the total in 2001 (UNECE, 2004, p.83). A 2002 study
 found it responsible for notable fluoride water pollution in the region. It also has been
 blamed repeatedly by the neighboring regions o f Uzbekistan for their serious ecological
 problems. This plant creates a dangerous ecological situation in Tursunzade and nearby
 territories, especially with its discharge o f fluoride compounds, but also other toxic
 pollutants (Table 3.5.1.1).

The box below presents results of one o f the recent studies on hydrogen fluoride pollution
inTursunzade region.

Box 3.5.1.1. Fluoride pollution in Tursunzade Region

Studies of this region'swater suppliesdiscovered that the content o f fluoridesexceeds PDK in surface waters
and underground waters (PDK = 1.5 milligram/liter). The content of fluoride in the surface waters of Jamoat
Karatag and Telman State Farm made up is 1.72k0.3 milligrams per liter and 2.00k03 milligrams per liter,
respectively. Analysis of samples of water from three different sources of water supplies situated in the
territoriesofthe Aluminum plant has shownthe following concentrations of toxic substances:
...       Fluoride:3.6k0.8and 7.1h1.4and 11.0+1.8 mg/l,
          Sulfates: 72,816,7 and 57,8*5,1 and 88,1k4,6 mg/l,
          HCO: 103*14 and 240k20, 140+12 mg/l.

Inhabitants of southern regions consume between three and four liters o f water daily during the summer
months. If a teenager (13-17 years old) drinks 3 liters of water containing3.5 mg o f fluoride, then in twenty
four hours he gets 1 mg of fluoride. An adult consuming four to five liters of water daily gets 1.4 -1-75 mg of
fluoride. As was mentioned above, the population of Republic gets 1.5 mg of fluoride daily through
foodstuffs, the biological effects of which equal 1.2 mg fluoride of drinking water. Consequently, the daily
consumptionof fluoride for teenagers makes up 2.2 mg, and for adults 2.6-3.0 mg, or 0.049 mg/kg o f weight
of body (accordingly). Although they intake a maximum quantity o f content of fluoride in foodstuffs,
neverthelessthe daily intake of fluoride by each inhabitant of Jamoat Karatag in Tursunzaderegionmakes up
approximately 2.8 mg. Among schoolchildren of 6-10 years of the region is observed that 55 o f 150 have
dental caries (37%).Among schoolchildren of 15-17years, 53 of 105 observedhave dental caries (54%).

The content of ion fluoride in samples taken from plants in our zones of research made up 6.5 to 12
milligrams/kilogram in Jamoat Karatagand. At Telman State Farm , it was from 7.8 to 16.3 mg/kg. The
content of fluoride in samples of soil also was more on the territory o f Jamoat (region) Karatagand made up
13 mg/kg.

The local populationis not aware about harmfuleffect of aluminum manufacturing on the environment and
on fluoride toxicity. The aim of the project was to improve health in the unflavored area of Tursunzade
region, where live 3,000 inhabitants (many of them are children less than 16 years old).

NGOs and concerned population, but also Government o f Uzbekistan attributes a lot of
negative health outcomes to environmental pollution from TaAZ. Air pollution would be
responsible for cardiopulmonary mortality and morbidity, as described in the urban air
pollution section. To capture these effects monitoring stations should be in operation in
Tursunzade and surrounding areas. Fluoride pollution o f drinking water i s also very
stressful for human health. The long list o f possible health outcomes would include lung
and bladder cancer, bone deformity, hypothyroidism, fluorosis, tooth decay, osteosclerosis
(hardening o f the bones), sinus trouble, perforation o f the nasal septum, chest pains,
coughs, thyroid disorders, anemia, dizziness, weakness, nausea, diarrhea,                         respiratory
disorders (sometimes termed "pot-line asthma'), hemorrhagic pulmonary edema (fluid
accumulation and swelling in the lungs), hypocalcaemia (a low blood calcium level),
hypomagnesaemia (deficiency o f magnesium in the blood) , cardiac arrhythmias, renal
failure, ventricular fibrillation,         serious damage to vegetation, respiratory, eye, skin

problems in animals. In some studies it has been found that there is a possibility that
fluoride can cross the placenta from the mother's blood to the developing fetus. Also,
there i s a possible increase in birth defects or lower IQ in children living in areas

withvery highlevels offluoride inthe drinkingwater17.
It is obvious that further research, including comprehensive epidemiologic studies are
needed to estimate direct impact from TaAZ on public health and ecosystems. TaAZ has
been proceeding with its equipment modernization to minimize negative impact, it has
succeeded in modernizing abatement pollution equipment for two production lines and
plans to modernizethe remainingproductionlines. FutureTaAZ development plans should
incorporate environmental concerns and minimize adverse impact on public health and
ecosystems.

3.5.2 Problems of Wastes Management

As Tajikistan 2002 State of the Environment Report estimates, over 22-25 million tonnes
of solid waste, 20 million cub.m of liquid industrial waste and 200 million tonnes of
mining waste are accumulatedin the republic. Total area of lands under waste dumps and
waste storage sites is 1,100hectares, of which miningwastes occupy 800 hectares of lands
and contribute 77% ofthe total waste accumulation. Managementof industrial, mining and
municipal wastes remains on the priority list of environmental problems in Tajikistan.
Wastes are mainly generated from mining of mineral resources, chemical and cotton
production,uraniumtailings, buildingrefuse and municipalwastes.

Industrialwaste

The industrial wastes in Tajikistan are generated by the building sector and chemical,
mining and metal and cotton industries. Major industrial waste generating industrial
enterprises are presentedinTable 3.5.2.1.

                                              45

There are about 400 sites that generate industrial wastes in the country. Of the total
industrial wastes generated mining sites that process 40 different types o f minerals
generate about 77 % o f all the industrial wastes. More than 200 million tons o f mineral
refuse i s accumulated in around 70 mines, o f which more than 23 million tons is
hazardous. Annually, 50 enterprises generate 1,000 tons o f galvanic toxic waste. The list o f
hazardous wastes generated in the country includes cobalt, arsenic, nickel, cadmium,
mercury, aluminum, lead and antimony. The hazardous wastes are usually dumped with
the rest of municipal refuse. These wastes are usually stored inthe territories ofenterprises
and then dumped in landfills that occupy over 300 ha. There are neither centralized
sanitary facilities for storage o f hazardous wastes nor special facilities for treatment or
secondary use o f hazardous wastes.

During the Soviet times Tajikistan used to be the main producer of uranium. Official
sources report about nine official sites for storage o f radioactive wastes that occupy 300 ha
with around 164 million tons o f radioactive mining ores and 180 ha (65 million tons) o f
radioactive tailings, mainly located in Sughd region and Faizabad district. These storage
facilities require urgent rehabilitation and impose substantial health risks to local
populations that live as close as 6 km away from the sites.

Municipalwaste management.

Annually up to 4-5 million cub. m o f municipal wastes are generated nationwide, o f which
1.2 million cub.m i s from in Dushanbe city. Most o f the waste is dumped at 70 legal
landfills that cover approximately 300 ha. The rest i s dumped at illegal landfills. Such
illegal landfills carry about 120 cub. m o f waste (no precise estimation i s available). Half
o f municipal waste is formed by kitchen refuse; the rest contains other components like
paper, plastics and resin, ceramics, glass, tree leaves and ash and about 7 % is medical
waste. There i s no waste sorting or treating facilities in the country. Existing communal
waste sites (both small transit in-city and permanent out-of-city dumps) are poorly
equipped resulting in toxic spills into water streams particularly after rain. There are no
mechanisms to control smell from the landfills, especially duringhot the weather.

Illegal burningo f leaves and other wastes, mainly to reduce the volume o f waste i s another
issue in the management o f wastes. The smell o f burning leaves and wastes can be felt
daily in all parts o f Dushanbe city. At least 60 large and numerous small waste burning
cases are registeredevery year. Since tree leaves absorb harmful elements, suchas lead and
other heavy metals, including up to 40 toxic harmful substances, burningleaves along with
plastic and other toxic elements pose a direct hazard to human health and further degrade
urban outdoor and indoor air quality. Local population and often workers o f municipal
services are not aware o f the health hazards o f burning wastes and practice burning on a
continuous basis.
The relationship between solid wastes and human health and ecosystems damages is
difficult to quantify. The most straightforward way i s to estimate the share o f particulates
and chemical pollution from waste burning. Also, health risk analysis methods could be
useful to pinpoint the pressure from leaking of cadmium, cobalt, nickel, chromium,
arsenic, and other elements from industrial wastes. However, modern monitoring
procedures should be applied. At present Tajikistan does not nave a capacity to facilitate
such an analysis.

                                               46

Uncontrolled wastes disposal requires urgent development o f modern methods to assess,
document, and monitor solid waste disposals and processing and investing ininfrastructure
necessary to protect the environment and the public from the most dangerous areas o f
uncollected solid waste and from accumulation in the most dangerous un-managed or
poorly-managed dumps.
Environmental health problems could be more effectively addressed by an independent
entity with clearly defined responsibilities for environmental health management. A
decentralized entity should be created within the Ministry o f Health to regulate emission o f
PM2.5, lead, toxic pollutants, and fuel quality to tackle air quality, and enforcing
bacteriological quality, persistent organic pollutants (POPS), volatile organic compounds
(VOCs), and heavy metals, among others, to deal with water contaminants that affect
human health.

IV. Natural Resources Damages inTajikistan

As World Bank, 2007 indicates, "Difficult livelihood conditions and land management
practices create high dependence and pressure on local natural resources, especially in the
mountain areas eventually resulting in degradation o f such lands". According to UNCCD,
2006 the, major categories o f land degradation in Tajikistan are similar to those in other
Central Asian countries. They include (1) soil erosion in rain fed farmlands, (2) pasture
and range land degradation, (3) degradation o f forests and bushes and related loss o f
biodiversity, (4) irrigation-related land degradation, in particular secondary salinity, water
logging and irrigation-related soil erosion, and (5) other forms o f land degradation as a
result o f natural disasters, soil contamination, etc. Land degradation eventually causes
more land slides and mudflows especially in the sensitive mountainous areas. Most
affected by degradation i s village-near pasture land as well as bush and tree vegetation.
Common causes are ineffective land management and lack o f alternate energy resources.
Land degradation not only affects agricultural productivity, biodiversity and wildlife, but
also increases the likelihood for natural hazards(Wor1d Bank, 2007).

Although the principal cause o f natural resource losses is degradation o f agricultural lands,
it is important to mention that all elements o f natural resource degradation inTajikistan are
interrelated and causality links often work both directions. In other words, part o f natural
resources losses could be attributed to irrational felling o f trees, irrational use o f pasture
and range lands leading to loss o f green cover, deforestation and agricultural land
degradation and vice versa. It i s very difficult to quantify these relations due to the lack o f
data. However, the analysis allowed estimating direct losses o f natural resources. Losses
due to degradation are estimated for croplands, rangelands, forests and natural disasters.
Losses to croplands include damages from soil salinity due to improper irrigation practices
and human-induced soil erosion. In the absence o f data on the annual increase in salinity
and eroded croplands and rangelands, the annual loss o f agricultural production (crop and
rangeland fodder) i s estimated based on accumulated degradation. This estimate may be
more or less than the net present value (NPV) o f annual production losses depending on
the rate of annual increase in degradation. Annual deforestation data are highly uncertain
and were estimated from secondary sources. Annual losses resulting from deforestation are
estimated as the NPV o f the value o f forest area lost. Losses from natural disasters are
estimated using 6-year average frequency o f negative events and the available point
estimation o f damages inmoney terms.

4.1. Costs to Crop Production
4.1.1. Soil Salinity

Soil salinity reduces the productivity o f agricultural lands and, if salinity levels exceed a
certain level the land becomes unfit for cultivation. According to the conventional welfare
economics, if agricultural markets are competitive, the economic costs o f salinity are the
losses inconsumer surplus (consumer willingness to pay above market price) and producer
surplus (profit) associated with the loss in productivity. The welfare losses include direct
losses when degraded lands become unfit for cultivation and reduced yield as the land
becomes saline or degraded. Inaddition to the above direct losses, there could also losses
from crop substitution to more saline-tolerant but less profitable crops and other indirect

 losses. Because of a lack of data, these losses are approximated by the value of "lost"
 output related to the salinity, with some simple adjustment for changes in cropping
 patterns.

 Total irrigated land in Tajikistan i s about 0.74 million hectares (Table 4.1.1.1). Nearly 16
 % of the irrigated land suffers from various degree of salinity and related problems (water
 logging and soil erosion).          Table 7.1.2 presents salinity levels of irrigated lands in
 Tajikistan. About 22 thousand hectares of lands with salinity more than 18 dS/m are
 cultivated. There is very little evidence on relationship between soil salinity and yield
 losses in Tajikistan. The single available literature i s on the relationship between soil
 salinity and yield losses in cotton (Bucknall, et al. 2003). According to Bucknall, et al., if
 salinity i s low then cotton yield loss i s 20-30 %; moderate salinity results in 40-60 %
 cotton yield loss, and high salinity results in above 80 % loss. We have used these data to
 estimate cotton yield losses due to salinity. In addition to the above results, data on soil
 salinity thresholds and yield effects of salinity from the international empirical literature
 (Table 4.1.1.3) are usedinthis analysis.18

Soil salinity results in changes in cropping pattern. There are no comprehensive data on
changes in cropping patterns in relation to specific levels of soil salinity in Tajikistan.
Hence to estimate the cost of salinity, it is assumed that more salt sensitive crops are
cultivated on the lands with lower salinity. If salinity were the only soil characteristic
affecting crop choices, optimal allocation would imply that the salt sensitive crops (from
pulses to vegetables inTable 4.1.1.4) are cultivated on the land that has salinity lower than
4 dS/m (see Table 4.1.1.3) while crops on more saline land are mainly wheat and cotton.

We consider two scenarios of cropping patterns on saline lands (Table 4.1.1.4). The first
scenario assumes that only cotton i s cultivated on the saline lands. The second scenario
assumes that cotton and wheat are cultivated on the saline lands, following the typical
average cropping pattern in Tajikistan. These cropping patterns, though are unlikely in
practice, representan upper and lower bound of the cost of salinity because of the different
market value and salinity tolerance of cotton and wheat.

The assumed cropping patterns on saline land correspond to a cropping intensity of 1 for
wheat and cotton for agricultural lands. This cropping intensity i s based on cropping
intensity reportedby the Ministry of Agriculture inTajikistan.

To estimate crop losses from salinity it i s necessary to estimate crop yields that would
realize inthe absence o f salinity. The following equations are solved for cotton and wheat
to estimate the crop yields ifthe soil i s not saline:




 where X is observed average yield; Xi i s yield on land with salinity leve1,i; a, b and c are
share of land with salinity 1evel"i"; and dj i s yield reduction on land with salinity 1evel"i"
which is estimated from the Table 4.1.1.3. Observed average yields, and estimatedyields
inthe absence of salinity andon severely saline landare presentedinTable 4.1.1.5.

Table 4.1.1.6 presents the estimated annual cost to agriculture o f soil salinity under
scenario 1 and 2. In order to estimate the costs, the salinity threshold values and yield
decline coefficients and the cropping patterns in Tables 4.1.1.3 and 4.1.1.4 were used. The
total quantities o f yield losses were then multipliedby local producer farm gate prices for
cotton and wheat to get the total losses. Farm gate prices in 2006 for seed cotton and
wheat were 1600 TJS and 700 TJS, respectively. The total annual cost o f crop loss from
salinity ranges from 105 to140 Million TJS with a mean cost o f 124 Million TJS. The
mean annual cost o f salinity i s about 1.8 % o f GDP in2006.

Soil salinity i s interrelated with water logging, soil erosion and nutrient losses. Lack o f
drainage on irrigated lands increases soil salinity and elevates water table. This reduces
yields, places a greater load on plowing and traction machinery and compacts the subsoil.
As a result o f such practices about 5 thousand hectares o f irrigated lands are not used every
year (Abdusaliamov. et al., 2000). If this land could be used for wheat or cotton
production, it could generate 8-16 million TJS annually, with mean o f 12 million TJS or
0.17 % o f GDP in2006.

Soil erosion also contributes to sedimentation o f dams inTajikistan.

Box 4.1.2.1 Dams in Tajikistan

As FA0 AQUASTAT country profile reports in 1994, there were 19 dams in Tajikistan: 5 in the Syr Darya
River basin and 14 in the Amu Darya River basin (7 on the Vakhsh River, 4 on the Pyandzh River and 3 on
the KafirniganRiver).Their total reservoir capacity is about 29 km3and the reservoir area is 934 km2.There
are nine large reservoirs (capacity more than 500 million m3each) with a total capacity of 25.34 km3and an
area of 690 km2.The largest reservoirs are: the Nurek on the Vakhsh River (10.5 km3),the Kayrakkumon the
Syr Darya River (4.16 km3),and the Lower Kafirniganon the KafirniganRiver (0.9 km3).

This inturn reduces the capacity o f dams and thus reduction in irrigation capacity. We do
not have reliable data on sedimentation o f dams and reduction in capacity o f dams in
Tajikistan. Hence estimates o f losses in crop reduction as a result o f sedimentation could
not be made. Abdusaliamov et al., 2000 report that sedimentation in Tajikistan results in
reduction in dam capacity that could additionally irrigate about 37 thousand hectares o f
land. The estimated loss o f revenue from wheat production on this land, which could
otherwise be irrigated in the absence o f sedimentation, i s about 42 million TJS or 0.6 % o f
GDP in2006.

Another problem associated with soil erosion i s the loss o f soil nutrients.Abdusaliamov et
al., 2000 report that annually about 1 million tomes o f major nutrients i s leached out from
the lands in Tajikistan, about 10 % o f which is leached out from the rain fed croplands
                                                     52

alone. Table 4.1.2.2 presents an estimate o f the amount o f fertilizers requiredto substitute
annual humus loss o f nutrientsthrough leaching.

The estimated cost of soil nutrients (in terms of N P K ) substitution is b ut 90 million

4.2. Cost of RangelandDegradation

The main causes o f rangeland degradation inTajikistan are irrational land use management
practices leading to denudation o f vegetation from rangelands and, exacerbated by
intermittent draughts has resulted in many pockets to desertification..                According to the
National Program for Combating Desertification (Abdusaliamov et al., 2000) degraded
rangelands constitute 96-100 % o f total rangelands in the country. Table 4.2.1 presents
data on the extent o f rangeland degradation inTajikistan.

 Two methods are used to estimate the cost o f rangeland degradation. The first method
 estimates the reduction in fodder production and i s then valued at the price o f fodder. The
 foregone livestock income due to the loss o f fodder as a result o f rangeland degradation
 based on livestock feed requirement is then used as an estimate o f the cost o f rangeland
 degradation inthe second method.

 Very limited data are available on rangeland fodder yields. Based on interviews with
 rangeland experts inTajikistan and data inTable 8.1 the current average yield i s estimated
 at 0.5-0.7 tons o f DM per hectare on degraded rangelands. This implies that the yield
 decline from cumulative degradation i s at least 0.6-0.7 tons per hectare.          Given the
 rangeland area o f 3.6 million hectares, the estimated total average loss due to cumulative
 degradation i s 1-1.4 million tons o f DM per year. At a fodder price o f 30-70 TJS per ton
 o f DM (per consultations with experts in Tajikistan), the loss as a result o f the reduced
 fodder production in60-SO million TJS per year average for a sustainable rangeland fodder
 utilization rate o f 40 or 60 %.

 The second method uses the reduction in livestock income as a result o f rangeland
 degradation. Relaible data needed to estimate foregone livestock income are presentedin
 Table 4.2.2. Total feed requirement in DM for the animal stock in Tajikistan is estimated
 at 5.3 million tons per year. The analysis showed that inthe absence o f the rangeland yield
 decline o f 1 million tons o f DM per year, o f which 40-60 % could be sustainably utilized,
 the rangelands could have supported an additional 20-30 % of current animal stock. Given
 that the total household net income from livestock is around 0.34 billion TJS per year
 (Hollinger, 2006), the loss in livestock income from rangeland degradation is about 22-51
 million TJS.

The recommendations below have a common origin, namely, deterioration o f soils in
Tajikistan due to irrational irrigation infrastructure management, lack o f drainage,
improper grazing practices, felling o f trees and cutting down the natral busheshegetations
causing deforestation on the mountain slopes and growing improper harnessing and use o f
water causing scarcity starting from civil conflicts period in the early 90ies. Given the
shortage o f Tajikistan's arable land area, it has come at a price: high levels o f denuded and
eroded lands and increasing salinity and water logging problems in irrigated valley areas
are increasingly common in Tajikistan. At the same time rigorous analysis would benefit
from improvement o f data. It i s vital to conduct new national inventories o f land use
pattern, degree o f soil erosion and high water table and salinity inflicted areas using the
supported by modern geospatial tools. Better data would allow better identification o f
problem areas and focus limited resources correspondingly. Although action has been
taken recently under CAWMPI9to strengthenthe Capacity o f Tajik Land Specailists inthe
use o f Geospacial tools.        The study results2' of the four watersheds under CAWMP
however provides the typical situation o f the vegetation cover and degradation risk classes
with a population of abot 550,000 people with a agricultural area of about 400,000 ha only
with an overall land area o f 36,000 km2area presenting the magnitude o f the problem in
Tajikistan. Further sections address necessary institutional and policy changes in the area
o f natural resources management inTajikistan. It i s important to ensure harmonized natural
resources management: land management should be coordinated with irrigation
rehabilitation and supported by comprehensive feasibility analysis o f soil conservation in
the vast area of pasture and range lands, in mountain areas and improvement o f irrigated
agricultural lands with investments in canal conveyance and drainage systems
rehabilitation.

4.3. Deforestation

The cost of deforestation and degradation of forests is the aggregate social loss associated
with degraded or deforested lands. These costs include, in theory, a wide range of local,


  The CAWMP project engagedthe The Centre for Development and Environment (CDE) ofthe Institute of
Geography, University of Bern (Switzerland) financing from the CTF, to work on the Capacity Building in
Use of GeospatialTools for Natural Resource Management (TA-PI05244-TAS).

   regional, national, and even global costs. Examples include direct losses like loss o f
   timber, fuel wood and non-timber products, recreation and tourism losses and indirect use
   losses (such as those associated with damages to ecosystem services, water supply and
   carbon sequestration), and non-use value loss associated with loss o f forests. This section
   examines each o f these categories o f losses with the available data. The losses associated
   with carbon sequestration have not been considered, except as noted inBox 4.3.2.

   Tajikistan's forest resources cover only about 3 % o f total land area. The total forest are in
   the country in 2004 is only about 401,000 hectares (UNECE, 2004). Although the Tajik
   Forestry Research Institute facilitated the F A 0 effort on the Global Forest Resource
   Assessment for Tajikistan in2005, the report has not provided any data on change inforest
   cover after 1990 (FRA 2005). This i s because forests in Tajikistan i s protected by law and
   only secondary cutting i s allowed, only about 6.5 cubic meters i s officially allowed to cut
   for wood fuel (UNECE, 2004). However, about 500-600 violations are reported annually
   and it i s estimated that allowed cut i s exceeded about 25%.*I


   Although the official documents do not provide evidence o f change in forest area due to
   deforestation in recent years, other documents suggest a more significant clearing o f
   forests. According to the First National Report on Biodiversity Conservation(2003), nearly
   6000 ha o f forested area with a total volume o f 10,000-15,000m3 are affected by illegal
   logging each year. Given the paucity o f reliable official statistics, the study used the above
   estimates to arrive at a lower bound on the losses due to deforestation and degradation o f
   forests. In addition to the above, SAVCOR's 2005 report to the World Bank estimates
   about 90,000 cubic meters o f illegal logging annually (equivalent o f 7000 hectares using
   about 13 cubic meters country average timber volume per hectare). This estimate is applied
   as an upper boundto estimate the losses due to annual deforestation.

   The UNECE, 2004 reports the following reasons for extensive illegal logging inTajikistan:

   8        Shortage o f fuel, especially during winter time;
*  8        Scarcity of wood for construction;
   8        High cost o f imported wood;
   8        Ignorance o f local communities o f legislative-statutory          acts and general
   preservation benefits.

   In the absence of official data on deforestation or forest degradation, the loss of forest
   value estimate i s highly uncertain. However, there are some attempts to estimate the value
   o f forest ecosystems for local population to support the establishment o f new conservation
   zones. For example, the GEF project for Dashtijum Biodiversity Conservation Project
   (DBCP) documented existence o f forests cover in almost all o f project area for the project
   (Box 4.3.1).

Box 4.3.1: Dashtijum Biodiversity Conservation Project (DBCP)

Project preparationactivity included a survey o f about 1280 households in the project area. These households
confirmed the significant dependence on nature resources: over the half of the households collect wild fruits
(58%) and herbs (52%); close to half of the households collect wild nuts, mainly walnuts and pistachio
(46%); and one of every 12 households collects mushrooms (8%). Around 17% of the households have
reported an average income of US$33 for 2002 and US$50 for 2003 from such economic activities. Only a
small %age of households (1.5%) reported nature products gathering as their main source of income.
Average annual income per household was $233-$333. Agriculture is the main economic activity of the
population and almost all households own land. Almost two third (65%) have reported that agriculture
activities are the main income source for their households. Due to climatic and geographical characteristics
of the region, the agricultural occupations are limited to livestock breeding, wheat production on small slope
land plots, and fruit gardening. Agriculture production is at the level of subsistence. The population is
experiencing serious problems with fuel supply and energy sources becauseof the lack of infrastructure and
organized trading system. About 86% o f households use collected wood for heating, averaging 5-7 cubic
meters per family, which covers less than 1/3 of the household needs (Source: MSP Project Brief: Tajikistan
Dashtijum Biodiversity ConservationProject 23).

There are about 1280 households in the project area and they annually collect about 7.5 thousand cubic
meters of wood. Taking into account that project area is about 80,000 hectares and average wood density in
Tajikistan is 13 cubic meters per hectare, they denude around 600 hectares annually, about 0.7 % of its area.
Note that this estimate is lower than the one based on the first National Report on Biodiversity Conservation
(2003), which suggests about 1.5 % of annual deforestationrate.

The major threats to forests in this area were identified as: uncontrolled hunting and
gathering o f rare plants, logging and intensivecattle grazing.

Deforestation has a number o f effects, both direct and indirect, and hence the cost o f
deforestation is very difficult to estimate. In addition to direct costs, deforestation may
contribute to increased frequency and severity o f flooding and landslides, and i s likely
contributing to agricultural land erosion problems. It i s also associated with impacts on
quality o f water resources. However, it i s practically very difficult to identify and estimate
these costs o f deforestation at the national level particularly in a country like Tajikistan
where there is very limited data and past literature on forestry and biodiversity effects.
Since data and background information are not available for Tajikistan we have used
estimates of values for the forests in other countries, applying a range o f values to reflect
the uncertainties ofusingthese values inTajikistan.

According to Fisher (2003) based on his study in Republic o f Kyrgyzstan (another Central
Asia country) some o f the reasons why it i s difficult to obtain reliable data on the
contribution o f forest products to household income are:

         There is likely to be systematic under-reporting o f income by the tenants
         themselves;
         Much o f household income i s in the forms o f subsistence goods and most o f the
         goods are bartered. Even nuts, which i s an important part o f cash income, i s
         sometimes bartered;
         Other benefits from forest plots (firewood, mushrooms and sale o f various fi-uits)
         are either non-cash benefits or are not recorded systematically;
         The value of access to arable fields and pastures access cannot easily be converted
         to cash equivalent;


                                                      57

     0  Nut harvests (and, to a lesser extent, fruit harvests) are extremely variable from
        seasonto season. As households do not usually record income, the data reported are
        from memory and hence not reliable;
     0  Market process vary considerably even within a particular season and between
        seasons and hence valuation i s very difficult.

The estimates in this analysis are based on the background studies by Pearce et a1 (2001)
and Lampietti and Dixon (1994).       Because o f the high degree o f uncertainty and data
problems, we present here average as well as high and low estimates. The high-end
estimates are based on the assumption that it i s possible to internalize all forest benefits
based on a forest "inventory" by the local community inthe short term, which obviously i s
an overestimation. The low-end estimates, on the other hand, are based on the possibility
that almost no forest benefits can be internalized because o f the absence o f market
infrastructure, roads, favorable public policy and highdiscount rates.

Important social forest values should be considered from a long-term perspective. The
present analysis considers only flows out o f sustainable wood fuel supply and non-timber
products collection. The financial flows from concessions and profit o f predatory logging
are not estimated. Although it i s generally accepted that in the short-term profits from
predatory logging are higher than from sustainable forest management, in the long term
with a real discount rate less than 20 %, sustainable management theoretically has a higher
net present value (Pearce et al, 1999). Pearce et a1 (1999) study debunks common
perceptions about higher profitability of predatory logging. In Tajikistan, all forests were
classified as category one which means that timber production i s not allowed anywhere.
Only secondary cuts for wood fuel are allowed in very limited amounts. So for the study
purposes, three components o f direct use forest value were estimated: non-timber products,
sustainable fuel wood production and ecotourism.

Sustainable fuel wood production is estimated by the governmental agency in Tajikistan
(UNECE, 2004). It i s estimated that about 6.5 thousand cubic meters o f fuel woods i s
produced annually over the total forest area in the country. Then for the deforested area
annual sustainable fuel wood losses would be 3-4 thousand TJS. Lampietti and Dixon's
estimates o f non-timber values in Central and South America ranges from US $9 to $10
per hectare. Using a value o f 9 TJS per hectare o f deforested land in Tajikistan the total
non-timber lost annually i s then 167-195 thousand TJS.

Another direct use value is ecotourism. Pearce et a1 (1999) estimates these values in the
range o f US $5-10 per hectare o f forest depending on the location specific character o f the
forests. Since tourism industry is very underdeveloped in Tajikistan, we use 0-10 TJS per
hectare as a range, and the corresponding upper limit on the annual loss o f tourism value o f
recreational forest is 217 thousand TJS.

The indirect use values o f forest include watershed protection, nutritional and
erosiodflood prevention, and waterhutrient recycling. Although there i s no definite
agreement in the literature about the magnitude o f the indirect forest value, Pearce et a1
(1999) presents a higher end estimate o f TJS 30 per hectare o f forest based on a review of
literature on values associated with forests. Applying this value to the annual forest losses
in Tajikistan gives an annual cost of 558-651 thousand TJS. In addition to the above


                                             58

indirect benefits, Pierce et a1 also gives an option value for forest associated with
bioprospecting (prospects o f new drugs to be developed in the future using rich forest
biodiversity). The option value associated with bioprospecting i s in the range o f TJS 0.01-
21 per hectare. Usingthe upper boundthe option value associated with bioprospecting lost
due to deforestation is 456 thousand TJS per year. We assign zero as the low-end estimate.
Pearce et a1 (1999) based on an extensive literature o f review has also estimated the
existence value o f forest associated with forest preservation at about TJS 13-27 per hectare.
This implies an annual loss o f existence values as a result of deforestation cost at around
242-586 thousand TJS.

As mentioned before, this analysis does not include the lost carbon storage values o f forest
as the carbon market price is uncertain at this point in time. Carbon markets are only
gradually emerging in the region and currently deforestation reduction i s not eligible for
any compensation. However, the situation could change in the near future. Then forest
values should be updated using carbon market prices and the eligible share o f the forest
that can be counted for carbon sequestration could be included inthe computation o f losses
due to deforestation (Box 4.3.2).

The estimated costs of deforestation from different cost categories in Tajikistan are
summarized in Table 4.3.1. NPV is the present value o f the stream o f costs from one year
o f deforestation. The direct use values, reflecting local private forest losses, include the
losses from non-timber products, fuel wood, tourism and recreation. Indirect use values
include watershed protection services values. Non-use values lost include bioprospecting
and existence values.

Taking into account only the direct and indirect use values o f forest, the mean cost (NPV)
o f annual deforestation o f 6-7 thousand hectares in Tajikistan i s estimated at about 15
million TJS (0.2 % o f GDP in 2006), with a range from 9-20 million TJS. It may be noted
that values associated with ecotourism, indirect use and non-use values approximated from
the literature account for about 88 % of the total annual cost of deforestation. Since the
indirect use and non-use values are highly uncertain the estimate o f the total cost should
also be usedwith caution.

 Box 4.3.2. Carbon storage value

 Carbon storage value of the forest is an indirect use value and it is quite an essential asset from a global
 climate perspective. An average biomass from 1 hectare of forest in Tajikistan is 14.5 tons2', or 7.2 tons of
 carbon per hectare23,as in (FRA, 2005). A carbon price at US $30 per ton C02, as at the European spot
 carbon market, implies a carbonvalue of aboutUS $780 per hectare. The carbonbenefit of forest is however
 not internalized at the current stage of the Kyoto Protocol negotiations. Ifthe international community would
 acknowledge an important role of forests in carbon storage in a post-Kyoto regime, then some mechanism
 could be initiated to provide compensationfor reductions in deforestation (Strukova, 2004). This mechanism
 is under intensivediscussionat the Conferences ofthe Partiesto the Climate Change Convention.

 Given 100 % protective status o f forests in Tajikistan, environmental regulation should
 concentrate on improved mapping, zoning and forest inventories to ensure better control o f
 illegal logging. At the same time, it i s important to promote cleaner energy sources for
 domestic use to reduce demand for fuel wood and establish clear land use regulation
 prohibiting improper use o f hillside lands for agricultural purposes. International
 cooperation should be the base for technical support for tree plantations, reforestation and
 agroforestry   .

 4.4. Natural Disasters

 Tajikistan i s annually afflicted by natural disasters such as droughts, floods, landslides,
 avalanches and storms. Severe earthquakes occur periodically. The total mean annual cost
 o f natural disasters is estimated at 115 million TJS, or 1.6 % o f GDP in2006.

 Box 4.4.1. DocumentedAnthropogenicReasons of Natural Disastersin Tajikistan

 The overpopulation of mountain areas and the improper selection of sites for economic activity, as well as
 use of technologies, cause the formation of man-made landslides, rock falls, and deep depressions, such as
 Shurab coal mines and other sites. The improper construction and exploitation of irrigation systems resulted
 in Zakhmatabad, Kamcha, and Sharora landslides, which caused the huge damage and death of many people.
 Building settlements in potentially dangerous landslide areas caused the destruction of the villages by huge
 landslides. Large reservoirs, like Nurek Reservoir, contribute to the local seismic activity, reinforcing the
 tectonic movements.

disasters


The State Statistical Agency o f Tajikistan is responsible for maintaining and reporting data
on natural disasters inthe country. The data on number and cost of damages from natural
disasters reported by the Statistical Agency are adopted inthis report to provide an order o f
magnitude o f the annual cost of natural disasters. The cost o f annually occurring disasters
i s based on annual averages for the 6-year period 2001-2006, for which data are available.

The total estimated annual cost of natural disasters is 115 Million TJS (Table 4.4.2). The
largest cost is associated with damages to housing followed by deaths, and then damages to
roads.

To address natural disaster problem, it i s necessary to develop an integrated response that
emphasizes prevention, vulnerability analysis, and risk assessment. A crucial element o f
the strategy would be the creation of a fund to provide incentives for local governments to
advance in the preparation and implementation o f prevention plans. Additional
nonstructural and structural measures that the Government should consider include
establishing as a national priority the reduction o f disaster risk and vulnerability, adoption
o f disaster prevention and risk assessment tools at all levels o f government, managing risks
in land use and urban planning, and diffusion of appropriate and safe construction
technologies. Mitigation o f natural disasters' impact should be an integral part of
adaptation to climate change strategy.

V. Climate Change and Hydro Power Potential

Climate change triggered by the rise in average temperature has became a global
environmental problem. In Tajikistan, the consequences o f global warming are mainly
observed in retreat o f mountain glaciers, increase in runoff and increase in the occurrence
o f natural disasters. Due to the peculiar geographic location, the glaciers o f Tajikistan
occupy up to 6% o f the country's territory and are regarded as the main glacial knot o f
Central Asia that regulate the climate o f the region and its river flow. Rivers o f Tajikistan
are considered as main sources of local power generation, irrigation and replenishing o f the
Aral Sea.

During the period o f 1961      -1990, the   mean temperature in the valleys increased by 0.7-1.2
Coand inthe mountains by 0.1-0.7 Co(First National Communication, 2002). The increase
in temperature in large cities was twice as high as 1.2 to1.9 Co due mainly to rapid
urbanization, infrastructure development and production growth. Models o f future climate
project that annual mean near surface temperature in Tajikistan will increase within the
interval o f 1.8-2.9"C by the year 2050. The projected rate of warming i s much greater then
the observed changes during the 20th century. Due to complexity of mountain landscape,
there is medium and low confidence in precipitation scenarios, where projection varies
from medium increase to some decrease. Major problem associated with temperature
change inTajikistan is glaciers retreat.


Box 5.1. Shrinking of Glaciers in Tajikistan

Pamir glaciers are shrinking because o f global warming, which jeopardizes the nation's water supply and
increases the number of natural disasters. Based on recent space photographs of the Russian Academy of
Sciences there are 5729 glaciers with the total area o f 7493.4 square meters and capacity of 660 Cub. Km. in
Pamir mountains. In Hissor-Alay mountains there are 3890 glaciers with the total area of 2327.8 square
meters and capacity of 135 Cub. Km. Experts argue that between 1957 and 1980 Hissor-Alay mountain
range lost 341.6 Sq. Km of ice or 15.6% of its total ice capacity and Pamir Mountains lost 773.3 Sq. Km or
10.5%o f their total ice capacity. Thus the Pamir-Alay range together lost 1114.9Sq. Km or 11.7%of its ice
volume. Smaller glaciers that comprise 80% of all glaciers melt more intensively than the larger ones. Since
1933, Fedchenko, the largest Pamir glacier shrank by at least 1 Km and continues to lose 16 m a year,
Skogatch glacier lost 98.8 mil. cub. m. Although several experts argue that these numbersare overestimated,
these are the most precise estimations available as glaciers were not closely monitored in recent years. On
average, glaciers that are located on the eastern side melt faster than those that are located on the northern
side ofthe mountains.

Since climate experts cannot give a precise scenario of melting of glaciers several alternative projections
should be considered. In the worst case scenario, if the average temperature will go up by another 1.5 C"
between now and 2050 one third of the total ice capacity can be lost and many small glaciers will disappear.
Zeravshan river affluent will change from ice-snow to snow-ice. Kofarnihon river will lose all glaciers.
Vaksh river will be affected to a smaller degree. The glaciation area o f the right bank of Surhob river will
shrink by up to 20 % and the ice area by 25-30 %. Kizilsu-Alai affluent will be less affected due to its
exposition to the northern site of mountains and onflow from Zaalai mountain (this slows down the melting
process). Muksu river basin glaciers will shrink by 10-20%. Obihingou river basin can lose up to third of its
volume. Glaciers of Western Pamir will lose up to 25% of their volume. Eastern Pamir glaciers will be less
affectedas they are locatedhigher than any other glaciers.

The First National Communication states that glaciers melting negatively affects different
local biodiversity on the mountain slopes. First National Communication, 2002 especially
i s citing potential damage to tugai ecosystem (flood plain) will degrade because o f
shortage o f water resources, increase o f temperature, and fire risk. Land degradation could
exacerbate due to longer dry periods and higher temperature in spring and summer.
Glaciers melting also alters development o f major sectors o f the economy including
agriculture, water and electricity supply through deterioration o f the irrigation potential,
reduction o f river flows and hydropower potential, especially concentrated in the most
affected river basins.

The expected temperature change evaporation will increase and irrigation systems would
need more water deliveredthrough irrigation. It is estimated that water needs for irrigation
o f basic agricultural crops will rise by 20-30% compared to present climate conditions. 20
% reduction o f irrigation water inthe vegetation period will cause the 15 % reduction o f
cotton yield, while a 50 % o f water supply deficit will result in 35 % cotton yield drop. At
the same time process o f dams sedimentation will accelerate. Since efficiency of irrigation
systems in Tajikistan is only 0.65, the impact could be a dramatic increase o f water
demand for irrigation (FirstNational Communication, 2002).

Irrigation potential i s has the same source as hydropower inTajikistan. About 90 % o f
power generating capacity inTajikistan i s hydroelectric (Library o f Congress. Country
Profile: Tajikistan, 2007, http://lcweb2. loc.8ov/frd/cs/profiles/Tai ikistan.pdf). About 70 %
o f the hydropower potential is concentrated along rivers Panj and Vakhsh (Table 5.1) that
could be potentially affected by climate change.

Although currently only 5 % o f hydropower is used, still most hydropower facilities are
located there (Nurek Power Station) and some new hydropower facilities have been
designed for construction on that river too (Rogun and Sangtuda Power Stations). Figure
5.1 below presents expected changes in annual river flow associated with climate change.
According to some projections, a constant increase o f temperature by 3-4C incomparison
with today's climate will dramatically shift the area and the volume of glaciers thereby
causing catastrophic decline o f water resources by 30% and more (First National
Communication, 2002).




                                                                        EmtnbuniollDf

Climate change also could affect hydropower engineeringthrough increased frequency o f
increased risk o f landslides and floods. Mountains occupy about 93 % o f the territory in
Tajkistan. High air temperatures lead to rapid snow melting and ice thawing thereby
creating conditions for formation o f glacial-born mudflows. Sometimes mudflows happen
as a result o f a glacial lake outburst formed by surging glaciers. There will be a necessity in
reconstruction, alteration o f the operation mode o f hydropower facilities, adapting in
agricultural policy to mitigate risk o f catastrophic events. First National Communication,
2002 reports that in 1991-2000, annual loses o f agricultural gross product from extreme
weather events totaled to 1/3 o f overall agricultural loss. Losses could be even higher in
the longer term with further temperatureincrease.

Deficient energy supply and extreme weather events could aggravate difficult living
conditions and lead to excess winter and natural disaster related deaths, as it happened in
2008. Industrieswill be affected too. As mentioned in section 3.5.1 Tajik Aluminum Plant
consumes about 40 % o f power generated in Tajikistan. Any interruptions o f energy supply

                                               66

alter aluminum production with significant adverse effects on fiscal revenues and balance
o f payments o f Tajikistan.

Climatic change would likely lead to further reduction o f available water resources for
population in Tajikistan. Already limited access to clean water (See section 3.3) could be
reduced further without adequate adaptation policy. Then in the longer term already
elevated diarrheal mortality and morbidity among children under five and older population
could rise further. Among other adverse effects of temperature increase WHO reports
(Campbell-Lendrum, D. and Woodruff R., 2007) additional cardiovascular diseases in
urban ares and increased area and numbers o f infectious and vector-born diseases. There
were studies inTajikistan that link malaria and temperature increase.

It is importantthat poor are the most vulnerable to adverse effects of climate change becausethey
do not have resources for coping and adequate adaptation.

There has been a positive movement in the recognition of the importance of climate change
adaptation strategy. Phase 2 o f the First National Communication o f the Republic o f
Tajikistan, 2003 studies the potential for mitigation and adaptation in Tajikistan.
Adaptation section especially concentrates on the water resources problems and
hydropower engineering strategy with regard to changing climatic conditions. This
document determines priorities and scope o f measures that could be taken by the Republic
of Tajikistan to adapt to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

This is clear from the incorporation o f these concepts in major documents on socio-
economic development could reduce vulnerability to existing negative weather events and
to the future climate impact. Yet, as a matter o f practice, the focus i s still on emergency
events and dealing with their immediate impacts, without a sufficiently integrated response
that emphasizes prevention, vulnerability analysis and risk assessment. Suggested

                                                 67

recommendations include highlighting disaster prevention and the reduction o f climate
change risk and vulnerability as a national priority. Such a move would also help
promoting a consistent unification o f climate change adaptation into socio-economic
development programs, designing coordinated water management - irrigation and power
generation plans, enhancing cross country coordination and electricity trade, as well as
incorporating risk assessment policies across the various ministries and functional areas,
from development planning to watershed management and hydro power projects. It i s
important to strengthen technical and organizational capacities, especially at the regional
and local levels, to manage risk reduction and organize the adequate response.

VI. Policiesand Institutions for EnvironmentalManagement

Tajikistan faces a number o f environmental challenges and environmental degradation i s
highly visible in the country -air and water pollution and their effects on environmental
health, problems in waste management, soil degradation, degradation o f rangelands,
deforestation and loss o f biodiversity and natural disasters. There i s a broad consensus at
the national and sub-national levels that there is an urgent need to address the
environmental problems in the country.       In order to address these issues the country
requires effective environmental policies, laws and strong institutions to implement them.
This section presents an assessment of the existing institutions and the regulatory
framework and the issues identifiedinenforcement o f the policies and regulations.

Harmonized land use pattern, soil and moisture conservation measures in mountain area,
with rational water management inthe irrigated agricultural valley lands are core issues of
environmental damage cost reduction. Inefficient irrigation practices with inadequate
drainage as well as poor land use cropping pattern approach results in low farm production
income level. Limited access to drinking water and deteriorating water supply and
sanitation infrastructure are major reasons o f increasing children mortality and morbidity.
Harmonized water management should also account for declining hydropower potential
and ensure resilience' o f development projects to climate change and adaptation needs.
Lack o f energy resources puts additional pressure on the poor in Tajikistan. Although
analysis of water management problems in Tajikistan i s constrained due to data gaps, cost
o f environmental degradation structure identifies clear priorities and areas for future policy
interventions.

The analysis suggests that the key constraints inenvironmental management inthe country
are not from the absence o f well defined environmental policies but rather inadequate
legislation and bylawdguidelines to implement specific polices in particular, weaknesses
in institutional design, lack of vertical and horizontal coordination, lack of capacity o f
institutions and insufficient funding. A number o f national and local/provincial level
agencies and different ministries are involved in the area o f environmental management.
There exist opportunities for significant improvement in environmental management
through better coordination among the different agencies. The analysis also suggests that
policies currently followed do not provide economic incentives for pollution reduction and
more efficient use o f natural resources.

6.1. Assessmentheviewof the policiesand programs for environmentalprotection
and natural resourceuse

Although the country suffered from civil war and political instability for about a decade
since independence in 1992, policies and programs for environmental protection began to
emerge as early as 1997. The government has since developed and implementedvarious
programs for environmental protection. The different government programs and action
plans formulated for protection of the environment and their progress are reviewedbelow:




                                             69

     a. State Environment Program for 1998-2008

Adopted by the government in 1997, this i s the first key policy document in the
environmental sector, and sets the basis for the broader set o f environmental policies. It
recognizes the importance o f a healthy and clean environment for sustainable economic
development and human survival. The program envisages participation o f government,
business, nongovernmental organizations and the general public in protecting and
improving the environment and to teach everyone about the importance o f sustainable use
o f natural resources. The state o f the environment in each oblast i s described in detail and
sets out the activities needed to restore or maintain an ecological balance or rectify a
particular environmental problem. It also lists immediate practical measures for preventing
land erosion, allocating land for highly productive crops, reforestation and protection o f
sensitive areas, restoration o f air and water quality and encouraging local industries to use
environment friendly raw materials and production techniques.

Inaddition to the list o f actions, the document identifies the nature o f each action, how it
should be implemented, the governmental bodies responsible for the activity and the time-
frames within which each activity should be completed. Each year since 1998, the
environmental agency (the former Ministry o f nature protection and then the State
Committee for Environmental Protection and Forestry, and now Ministry o f Agriculture
and Nature Protection) prepares annual progress reports. While there has been progress in
implementation o f some o f the actions envisaged, some others are often delayed by a year
or two, primarily because o f lack o f funds.

There has been some progress in implementation o f activities like expansion o f specially
protected territories- such areas now cover one fifth o f the country. Also, reforestation
efforts are showing encouraging results in the densely populated areas in the Hissor
Valley, in Dushanbe and its surroundings, and in Sughd oblast. However, there has been
little progress in provision o f improved water management and sewage treatment. For
example, the construction o f a biogas plant at the sewage collection facility in Khujand i s
less than 10% complete and was suspended midway, despite its obvious importance for the
Sughd oblast and downstream territories, mainly because o f lack o f funding from the
Sughd oblast environmental protection committee.

     b. State program on environmental education

The state program on environmental education adopted by the government in 1996
envisages conservation inuse o f natural resources, the importance o f recycling and gradual
transition to a closed-cycle production at all enterprises. The program calls for a system o f
continuous and universal environmental education giving emphasis on education for
managers o f enterprises that may have adverse impacts on the environment or who work in
the area of nature protection. However, the analysis undertaken for this study suggeststhat
the implementation of this program has beenvery weak from the Government side and has
not received adequate donor attention.

     c. National action program to combat desertification

In 2001, the Government appointed the chair of the State Committee for Land
Administration to coordinate the development o f a national action program to combat
                                               70

desertification. The program analyzed the extent o f desertification and soil degradation in
the country, their causes and consequences- environmental, economic and social -and
developed a strategy to combat desertification. The strategies include, inter alia,
monitoring the desertification process and creating an information system on
desertification problems, classifying the territories according to the degree o f soil
degradation, measures to combat erosion and soil degradation, drafting new legislations
and modifying existing legislation on the use o f natural resources, increasing the
participation o f the local population and non-governmental organizations and developing
social and economic instruments for action against desertification.

    d. National strategy and action plan on conservation and sustainable use of
         biodiversity

InSeptember 2003, the Government adopted the National Strategy and Action Plan on the
Conservation and Sustainable Use o f Biodiversity and established the National
Biodiversity and Biosafety Center to oversee its implementation. The Strategy and Action
Plan are intendedto provide the basis for sustainable development o f all biodiversity, from
genotypes o f plants and animals, communities and ecosystems, wild and cultivated plants
and domestic animals.

    e. Nationalaction plan for mitigationof climate change

The Government adopted the National Action Plan for the Mitigation o f Climate Change in
June 2003. The plan sets priorities and measures to address the problem o f climate change,
to develop capacity for further research and analysis o f the climate system, and to
strengtheninternational cooperation inthis area. The measures are meant to serve as a basis
for planning and decision-making at the state and sectoral levels.

    f. Nationalaction plan in environmentand health

The national action plan on environment and health has a mandate to provide information
on air and water pollution and to develop measures to reduce air and water pollution to meet
the WHO quality standards.

    g. Center for EnvironmentalPolicy and Information

The Center for Environmental Policy and Information was established in 2005 with
technical assistance from Asian Development Bank in order to develop capacity in
strategic planning and coordination o f environmental policy. The center's objectives are to
facilitate better integration o f environmental issues in strategic development plans o f
Tajikistan and creation o f a database to improve coordination within and across
departments and among the donors on environmental issues. The CEA study team found
that this center has not beenable to meet any o f its objectives so far.

     h. NationalEnvironmentAction Plan (NEAP)

The NEAP aspires to establish an effective system to monitor meteorological and
environmental data,      improve the quality o f meteorological services,         implement
international obligations related to the environment, inclding the national implementation
                                             71

plan (NIP) in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPS)and other
chemical pollutants like DichloroDiphenylTrichloroethane (DDT), to phase them out and
stopping their use, under pesticide usage. The Governement has resolved to develop a
forecasting system for natural disastersand and to assess climate pattern and climate
change. Following the NEAP, the National Development Strategy (NDS) and Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PRSP-2), laidout the following priorities for the environment sector:

        improvement of institutional potential to address environmental issues with the
        object of achieving environmental sustainability;
        development of institutional capacity to forecast natural disasters and effective
        management of natural disasters should they occur;
        enhancement of natural resource management, preservation of biodiversity and
        protection of ecosystems.

Inthe light of the above NDSPRSP-2 priorities and the problems inthe sector, the NAEP
has identified the following two priorities for the strengtheningenvironmental protection:

     a. Implementation of institutional reforms and improvement of legislative base and
         promotion of existing and new investment projects. This includes measures to
         optimize and strengthen the functions of potential agencies responsible for the
         development and implementation of policies and to reinforce the legislative for
         environmental activities.
     b. Promotion of existing and new investment projects in the area of environmental
         protection. The specific measures include investments to promote environmental
         sustainability and at preventing the release into the environment of hazardous
         substances that have a negative impact on public health and the natural
         environment with emphasis on key sectors like energy, industry, agriculture, eco-
         tourism, etc.

It should however be noted that although the environmental policies, plans, and strategies
in Tajikistan are rather well developed and documented, majority of laws lack
implementation mechanisms due to the limited interdepartmental coordination including
poor coordination across various line ministries and state agencies.

6.2 Constitutionalprovisions and laws regardingenvironment

Adopted in 1994 and amended in 1999 and then in2003, the Constitution declares that the
State undertakes to ensure a healthier environment and guarantees the efficient use of
natural resources for the benefit of the people of Tajikistan. Under the Constitution, land
and mineral resources, water, air, animals and plants, as well as other natural resources,
belong exclusively to the State. Although the Constitution declares that the State
acknowledge, respect and protect individual rights and freedoms and that the State bodies
and officials should grant access to information related to individual rights and interests, it
does not guarantee environmental safety or right for individuals to use natural resources,
including such essential ones as air, water and land. In order to enforce the constitutional
provisions the government has enacteda number of legislations regarding environment and
use of natural resources, which are reviewed below.



                                              72

     a. L a w on nature protection

The Law on nature protection was adopted in 1993 and later amended in 1996 to delineate
the environment-related powers o f various governmental bodies - the Government, the
then Ministry of Nature Protection and the local Khukumats (councils/municipalities). It
was again amended in2002 to preserve the uniquenesso f protected territories and to define
more precisely the guarantee o f a healthy and favorable environment to the general public.
The law stipulates protection o f the environment, sustainable use of natural resources and
minimization o f the impacts o f economic activities on the environment and natural
resources.    In order to implement the environmental policies, the law identifies the
applicable legal principles, the protected objects, the competencies and roles o f the
Government, the State Committee for Environmental Protection and Forestry, local
authorities, public organizations and individuals. It mandates a detailed ecological and
environmental impact assessment on any activity that could have a negative impact on the
environment.      Furthermore, it requires and outlines the procedure for developing
environmental quality standards.

Inits efforts to deal with environmental emergencies and natural disasters the law defines
environmental emergencies and disasters and prescribes the order o f actions in such
situations, defines the obligations o f officials and enterprises to prevent and eliminate the
consequences, as well as the liabilities o f the persons or organizations that caused damage
to the environment or otherwise violated the Law. The Law also laid provisions for
environmental education so as to create awareness among the public on environmental
issues and sustainable use o f natural resources.

     b. Law on Specially Protected Territories

The 2002 law on specially protected territories is designedto conserve the protected areas
like nature reserves and natural parks from overexploitation. The law requires all such
territories to be regarded as one system owned by the State and should be recorded in the
Cadastre o f Specially Protected Territories. Each type o f specially protected territory i s
subject to a different protection and use regime, for instance all activities are strictly
prohibited in nature reserves, while certain areas o f natural parks can be used for tourism
and other limited economic activities. The use o f protected territories i s subject to strict
environmental screening so as to ensure that such uses do not cause any ecological harm.

     c. Law on Radiation Safety

The 2003 law on radiation safety vested the Agency for Nuclear and Radiological Safety
with all aspects of radiological control. According to the above law, all activities related
nuclear and radiological applications, nuclear waste disposal and waste sites has to be
licensed by the above agency. The country has also ratified a number o f international
conventions inthis area, which were included into the system o f national legislation.

6.3 Environmental Policy Instruments

The 2002 amendment to the Law on Nature Protection sets out a numbero f instrumentsfor
environmental protection.    They include the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA),
market based economic incentives, quota on pollution and use o f natural resources,
                                               73

environmental education and environmental information system.

6.3.1 EnvironmentalImpact Assessment

In Tajikistan, Environmental Impact Assessment is a component of State Ecological
Expertise (SEE), as set out inthe 2002 amendments to the Law on Nature Protection and in
the Law on Ecological Expertise. The amendment requires that all new facilities and
activities that may have an impact on the environment be subject to EIA. Once
environmental impact assessment i s undertaken, it i s subject to mandatory review by the
State Ecological Expertise. The laws also require the Government to approve a list o f
activities and objects for which EIA is mandatory. The procedures for environmental
impact assessment were approved by the GoTR (as per Decree on 3.10.2006, JVc464). It
authorizes the State Ecological Expertise currently under the system o f State Control inthe
MinistryofAgriculture to be responsible to conduct such assessments.

The Environment Protection law envisages two types o f environmental impact assessments
- State Ecological Expertise (SEE) and Public Ecological Expertise (PEE).            The PEE
allows public with expertise and businesses to participate in the general process o f the
ecological assessment o f a project. While the SEE i s the pre-conditionto beginany type o f
activity, PEE i s binding only after its results are approved by the SEE, the official organ.
According to the 2003 law, the objective o f Ecological Expertise i s not only to prevent
negative environmental impact as a result o f the proposed activity but also to periodically
monitor environmental and anthropogenic impacts.

Both private individuals and public associations, who are permitted by their charters, can
initiate PEE. Such PEE may be initiated only after a formal application with the local
authority (Khukumat) and its approval. The State Environment and Nature Use Control
Service do the SEE. The SEE may attract leading scholars and qualified third-party
specialists to draft the SEE and review it.

According to the Sughd Oblast Department o f State Environment Control all the SEE
drafters must submit their requests to do an SEE at least before beginning o f new
construction for no land can be allotted for without positive response from Khukumat. The
final SEE draft needto be submittedbefore the business is allowed to actually run.An SEE
i s mandatory for reconstruction o f business although the number o f SEE requests for
reconstruction o f businesses i s less, as reconstruction i s usually less visible.

6.3.3 Economic incentivesand quantity restrictions

The economic instruments for pollution reduction include charges for waste disposal,
emission charges for pollutants discharged into water bodies, emission charges for air
pollutants and charges for use o f natural resources. In addition to the prices and charges,
the government has also imposed quantity restrictions on pollution discharges and use of
natural resources.

One o f the major environmental problems in the country is the management o f wastes.
The wastes from industries, both toxic and non-toxic, and solid domestic wastes are
collected and disposed by waste management services for which they receive a payment.
There i s a charge per unit o f waste disposed and the total payments are based on the

                                                74

quantity o f waste collected.

Inthe case of atmospheric emissions there are quotas and charges per unit o f emissions for
the different pollutants identified, the chargeable air pollutants cover 123 components. In
the case o f automobiles, the government charges an annual tax on vehicles, which is a
source o f revenue for oblasts, cities and rayons.       The State Inspectorate for Water
Resources and local (oblast, city and rayon) services dealing with water resources enforces
charges on pollution discharges into water bodies. There are also quotas and charges for
use o f water resources. Although the system o f charges exists for a long time, their low
level would not provide sufficient incentives for pollution reduction. The major benefit o f
this systemis creation of institutionalbackgroundfor environmentalprotection.

VII. EnvironmentalGovernance

7.1. Institutionaldesign: vertical and horizontalcoordination

The previous section reviewedthe government programs, action plans and the institutions
set up for protection o f the environment. This section takes a closer look as to whether
these programs and institutions are capable o f or have succeeded in addressing the key
environmental risks and concerns. The CEA found that the government has set norms for
air and water pollution, residual traces o f chemicals and biologically harmhl microbes in
food, regulations regarding noise, vibration and magnetic fields, exceeding the threshold
levels results     in administrative  actions and financial sanctions. However, their
implementation remains unsatisfactory due mainly to weak institutions to implement them
and lack o f coordination, vertical and horizontal, across institutions. Although the
government has enacted a number o f laws and proposals to improve the state o f the
environment there i s very limited state capacity for policy development, regulation, and
implementation.

The measures to improve coordination in implementation of environmental policies are
further outlined inthe Priority 1 and Priority 2 o f the recent NDS. Priority 1 o f the NDS
identifies implementation of institutional reform and improvement o f legal basis, among
others to bring environmental policy in compliance with the existing social and economic
realities. It further recommends optimization o f functions and capacity building o f the
organizations responsible for environmental policy implementation and guidelines to
ensure that funds allocated to environmental protection are not actually spent for other
purposes. The Priority 2 o f the NDS has proposals for new investment projects in
environmental protection to reduce emissions from agriculture, industry and energy
sectors. It also plans to develop ecological tourism inthe country.

The environment protection law stipulates several types of institutions to implement the
environmental regulation at the state, ministerial, businessand community levels. The state
level control is exercised by the State Control Service on Nature use and Protection in the
Ministry of Agriculture and Environment Protectionand by the Sanitary Inspection Service
o f the Ministry o f Health and Inspection on Mining Safety. At the ministerial level
enforcement is done by different ministries and the state agencies under them with no
effective coordination across the ministries. Organizational structure o f environmental
management inTajikistan i s describedinAnnex 4.

7.2 EnvironmentalGovernance

The government has enacted a number of legislations that set forth responsibility for
violation o f specific environmental laws. In particular, the Administrative Code o f 1998
establishes an administrative liability for businesses, their staff members and individuals
for violations related to negligence in land use for agriculture, water use or state ecological
expertise. The administration and enforcement o f the provisions o f the law are vested with
different agencies and/or administrative units so that administrative sanctions can be
applied by such agencies like administrative commissions o f hukumats, courts, inspectors



                                              76

o f the State Service, veterinary inspectors, and State Committee on Land Use. The
authorities o f these agencies are well explained inthe Code.

There are also controls at the business level. The business-levelcontrol impliesthat every
business has to observe the environmental laws. Both individuals and employees are
subject to administrative enforcement (fines).          The most common administrative
enforcement (fine) ranges from salaries for 10 months for individuals and up to salaries for
15 months inthe case o f employees.

However, in practice, both the ministerial and business-leveltypes o f controls are less than
effective because o f the strong economic interest inpromotion o f businesses which in some
cases overrides environmental concerns. Should a violation occur, neither a ministry, nor
business would suspend their activity inthat area, nor would they report to the State Service
or related state agencies. The state agencies, however, lack enough resources and technical
capacity to perform periodic monitoring o f the sites. There are also instances o f corruption
due to low salaries and morale ofthe staff.

The inspectors who are in charge of enforcing the regulation often lack enough resources
to perform inspections on a systematic basis. Usually, it takes the inspector over a year to
revisit a business with inspection to see if the remedial measures suggested based on
previous year's inspection are implementedor not. It i s only during this second visit that
an inspector could impose a fine for noncompliance if any.

An environment protection agency can suspend operation of an enterprise if it is found in
violation o f the codes. For instance, in 2003, in Sughd oblast local environment protection
committee suspended over 70 such enterprises.           Prosecutors investigate ecological
violations/citations and thus play an important role in environmental law enforcement.
Functions o f environment protection inspectorate do not duplicate functions attached to the
prosecutors rather they cooperate with each other. The citations are forwarded to local
police departments and prosecutors' offices for investigation, and then such case may turn
into a criminal violation.

The Criminal Code adopted in 1998 includes punishmentsfor violations of laws regarding
environmental safety, poaching, land degradation and pollution, protection o f subsoil
resources. The minimal fine for such violations i s up to 2000 minimal monthly salaries or
up to 8 years of imprisonment as maximum punishment.However, only 2 criminal cases
were initiated since 1998. Since both were related to military activity they were not taken
up incourts.

Inaddition to state agencies, public organizations or trade unions can exercise control o f a
state organ, a business or individual by reporting violations to law enforcement
organizations or local environmental committees.

The analysis conducted for this study found that although environmental laws and
regulations exist, they are complex and are outdated, most o f which could be traced back to
Soviet period. Such complex regulations and weak regulatory systems result in poor
environmental governance.      There has been much discussion on the use o f economic
instruments to stimulate environment friendly production systems in agriculture, industry
and other sectors, but there has not been much progress in actual implementation o f such
                                              77

policies. It may be noted that pollution reduction if any achieved may not be due to the
success in environmental governance and use o f economic incentives, but rather due to
closure o f enterprises and or cut-back inproduction.

The country has received both technical and financial support from international
organization for environmental protection. Tajikistan is a signatory to the UNconventions
and regional agreements regarding environment. The government has since then ratified
domestic environmental laws and regulations so as to conform to the frameworks o f these
international conventions and agreements.

The analysis shows that restructuring o f the Sate Committee for environmental protection
and its merger with the Ministry o f Agriculture has not improved its performance and
delivery o f environmental outcomes. The current SCSNREP i s working with outdated
norms and standards, inadequate legislative base for implementation and constitutional
base that bring chaos and misunderstandingat all levels. Further, it may be noted that the
Ministry o f Agriculture and Nature Protection has traditionally beenattaching low priority
to environmental protection.

The SCNREP under such a Ministry may not be able to effectively deliver better
outcomes. The agency does not have enough capacity, interms o f number o f inspectors, to
conduct regular inspections and enforce citations.         Hence, with limited number o f
inspectors, they concentrate on larger (more visible) businesses, or respond to specific
claims submitted by public (for instance reports on unauthorized garbage dumping, trees
felling, etc.). The scarcity o f inspectors and their work overload results in low number o f
reported violations (fines). Inspectors would not normally be able to impose fine or draw
up a report unless the violator is revisitedandprovedthat the violation was not repaired.

Local inspectors are well integrated into the departments o f state environment control. The
decisions on how to distribute responsibilities between officers on sites i s done at the local
level. This often results in inspectors running unauthorized inspections with a main
objective o f rent seeking. In some cases, the Service and the Departments run joint
inspections, normally, as requestedby the latter.

7.3 Licensingand Permitting

According to the 2002 amendment to the Law on Environment Protection all new
businesses that are expected to have an environmental impact need the State Ecological
expertise (SEE). An Environment impact assessment (EIA) i s a component o f the SEE and
the EIA has to be accepted by the environmental protection authorities. The government
has initiated compilation o f a list o f economic activities and facilities subject to these
guidelines. As regards the EIA procedure, guidelines on the limits of inspections,
consultations, access to information, decision making process, cooperation with NGOs and
other structures as they may comply with the Arhaus Convention and role o f courts have
not been finalized. The laws require public hearings on the list o f activities and the EIA
procedure itself that has not yet been done. The analysis found that licensing procedure is
not clearly defined inthe environmental law.

The license holders are granted permits to use a certain quantity of a particular resource at
a specified territory over a specified period o f time. Permits can be issued both to
                                              78

individuals (for types o f animals or plants) and entities (to use ground waters). There are
also permits for discharge o f wastes to industrial or agricultural entities. Such permits are
issued by relevant State Inspection agency (for instance water or air), or by local
departments. Permits allow discharge o f certain amount o f pollutant and are usually issued
for one year.

Individual and legal entities are eligible to become ecological experts who can conduct the
impact assessments. However, such entities need to be licensed as per the licensing
procedure adopted by the Tajik government in June 2003 by submittingtheir application to
obtain license from the State Environment Control Service.           License i s granted for a
successful bidder in 15 days and i s valid for 2 years with the option for extension. The
licensee may be subjected to inspection and review by State environment control
authorities to comply with the license requirements. License i s necessary to participate in
the EE procedure, hazardous wastes handling, industrial safety, ionized radiation,
production o f pesticides and other agrichemicals and their handling. As a rule, license i s
granted by a higher regulatory authority in the Ministry (Ministerial Committee) or other
authorized structure.

 7.4 Complianceand enforcementmechanisms

There are established standards for water and air quality, noise and vibration, magnetic
fields, and other physical pollutants. As regards food, the government has established food
quality standards with threshold limits on chemicals or biologically hazardous bacteria in
food. Violation o f the threshold limits results in administrative procedures and penalties
including financial sanctions.

Individual ministries establish environmental quality standards within its authority. For
instance, the Ministry o f Health has the authority to regulate levels o f noise, magnetic
fields and other physical factors. The former Ministry o f Environment had the authority to
regulate emission of pollutants into air and water and treatment and management o f wastes.
The 1998 Administrative Code sets liabilities for violation of environmental laws the
enforcement o f which i s entrusted to the respective ministrieshtate agency. The above
code sets liabilities on business entities, their staff and individuals for violations including
violation o f SEE expertise. Administrative sanctions for violations can be enforced by
administrative commissions o f Khukumats, courts, inspectors o f state service, vet
inspectors o f the Ministry o f Agriculture, Agency for Land Use, Geodesy and Cartography.

The most frequently practiced punishment i s a monetary fine - up to 10 monthly salaries
for individuals and up to 15 monthly salaries for employees. The fees and charges
collected for violations are deposited in an ecological fund. However, the number and
amount o f such fines and charges collected are very low because o f poor infrastructure to
enforce the laws. According to the Sughd department only about 10 % o f the violators
paid the fine in 2001, which increased to about 50 % recently in 2006. Such increase in
compliance i s because inspectors are reporting to the cases to departmental lawyers who in
turn take the cases to court. The courts in turn dispose the cases in 2-8 weeks.            The
Ecological Service may also suspend business activity o f the violator. In 2003, the local
environment protection committee in Sughd oblast suspended operation o f 70 business
entities.


                                              79

The 1998 Criminal Code describes crimes against ecological safety and environment;
industrial safety rules, poaching, land contamination, misuse o f subsoil resources. The
maximum fine can reach up to 2000 MMS and term of imprisonment up to 8 years. In
practice, only 2 such cases were considered for over the past 2 years. Lack o f vertical
coordination between Ecological Service and environmental agencies result in problems
when performing joint inspections. Another problem is weak staffing policy and financial
support in every inspectorate. Although the government has made a number o f bold steps
in the form of legislations, the institutional capacity currently in place is insufficient to
implementthe proposed initiatives.

The wastes from industries, both toxic and non-toxic, and solid domestic wastes are
collected and disposed by waste management services for which they receive a payment.
The payments are based on the quantity o f waste collected. Local (oblast, city and rayon)
committees for environment protection prescribe limits for disposal o f wastes for
enterprises, review and approve the settlement of payments (to be prepared by enterprises
and submittedto committees) and collect payments. The State Inspectorate for Land and
Wastes Disposal and local committees supervise (separately or jointly) the compliance o f
enterprises with ecological legislation and settlement o f all ecological payments.      The
inspectors have the power to impose penalties for violation o f the legislation on wastes
disposal (including the cases o f unauthorized scrap-heaping and disposal o f wastes).

Charges for disposal o f utility wastes are equivalent to their retail price. Such charges are
enforced to stimulate enterprises to seek markets for waste products or encourage
processing o f wastes by the enterprises themselves. The country has a very low capacity to
process wastes from industries. This i s the main reason for the absence o f a system for
collection and trading of wastes with the exception o f waste paper, which i s processed at
small-scale factories. The charges for the disposal waste paper ranges from 0.024 to 0.24
somoni per ton or cubic meters while the charges for disposal of waste products like ash,
rubber wastes, metallurgical sludge, non-toxic industrial wastes and solid domestic wastes
are about 0.12 somoni per cubic meters.

The revenue from payments receivedfor collection o f wastes is the main source o f funding
for the ecological funds in the country, in spite o f the low charges for waste disposal (on
the average about $0.04 per cubic meter for non-toxic industrialwastes). For example, the
Sughd oblast annually collects 223,000 somoni (of which 66% are payments for disposal
o f wastes within allowable limits and 34% for exceeding the limits). In aggregate they
make two-thirds o f total paymentsreceived by the ecological fund.

Cities establish their own charges for collection and disposal o f wastes. In large cities
where such services are offered there is at least one municipal agency responsible for
collection o f wastes. A typical example o f a large city is Khujand, the second biggest city
after Dushanbe.    Collection, transportation and disposal o f wastes in Khujand are the
responsibility o f the City o f Khujand Garbage Truck Depot under the Housing-and-
Communal Services Agency. The former fixes charges for collection based on its costs,
subject to approval by the City Housing-and-Communal Services Agency, Khukumat and
the City Anti-Monopoly Committee. Enterprises based within the city shall sign an
agreement for collection and disposal of wastes with the City o f Khujand Garbage Truck
Depot. The payments are based on de facto quantities of wastes collected. The City o f
KhujandGarbage Truck Depot has concluded an agreement o f collection o f street garbage

                                             80

and earth closet sewage also with the Khukumat. The cost o f this service i s borne by the
municipality. The revenue from collection charges i s the major source o f revenue (about
 80%) for the Truck Depot. Charges for disposal o f domestic garbage for the year 2004
was 3 somoni (less than US$l)per capita. However, only about 25 % o f households made
their payments promptly. The projected revenuefor the year 2004 from collection charges
was 1.05 million somoni, which would be sufficient to cover all costs incurred by the
agency, including costs for purchase o f updated machinery or starting a new landfill

The analysis however showed that the charges for waste collection and the other economic
incentives are not sufficient to stimulate reduction inwastes and development and adoption
o f environment friendly production technologies.

The State Inspectorate for Air Pollution Control and local (oblast, city and rayon)
environmental committees regulate atmospheric emissions in the country. The functions
o f the State Inspectorate are to fix the emission quotas for the different entities and the
emission charges for the set quotas and to collect the payments. The inspectors may
impose penalties for violations, if any, including the cases o f unauthorized discharges and
air outbursts due to industrial accidents or machinery breakage.

Though chargeable air pollutants cover 123 components, only a few o f them are tested and
included in payments. The local environmental coefficients are considered in estimating
the emission charges.      For example, local coefficients for the City o f Dushanbe are
estimated at 2, for Kurgan-Tube (an administrative centre o f Khatlon oblast) it is 1.7; the
coefficients for Khujand (an administrative centre o f Sughd oblast) and Tursunzade (the
site o f the Tajik Aluminum Plant) are 1.4 and 1.6 respectively.

The enforcement o f the emission charges however has a lot o f problems and limitations.
The air pollution charges, in principle, is based on annual actual quantities discharged.
However, since no enterprise (except for the Tajik Aluminum Plant) is equipped with
monitoring facilities such estimations cannot be made. Instead, the estimators take into
account the type and number o f operating machineries, the term o f their service and
availability o f gas-cleaning facilities. Then in order to fix the limits it i s assumed that an
enterprise shall be operating at full capacity. Since most o f the enterprises use only part o f
their capacity, it is natural that they should claim preferential tariffs. As a rule, such claims
are met.

The analysis found that the current system o f payments for air pollution is not
economically efficient, as it does not provide enough economic incentives to reduce
emissions. For example, in the entire Sughd oblast the local ecological fund in 2003
amounted to 8,775 somoni ($2,925). The Tajik Aluminum Plant whose share in Tajikistan
industrial production volume constitutes 40% annually pays only 12,500 somoni ( about $
4,000) in air pollution penalties while its exports revenues for the first half o f 2003
amounted to $200,000,000.

The state owned enterprises, particularly the electric utilities and heating companies, are
excluded from payment o f emission charges because o f their poor economic standing. The
inspectors in association with officers o f local ecological agencies may also agree on
preferential payment rates for these entities


                                               81

Another major source o f air pollution in the country i s the emission from automobiles and
the transportation sector. The government charges an annual tax on vehicles, which is a
source o f revenue for oblasts, cities and rayons. Neither the annual tax on vehicles nor the
transportation tariffs promote fuel efficiency and emission reductions from the automobiles
and inthe transportation sector.

The water resources inthe country are managedjointly by the State Inspectorate for Water
Resources and local (oblast, city and rayon) services. The local offices (oblast, city and
rayon) fix quotas for intake o f water and for discharge o f pollutants into water bodies and
collect the respective charges. The state inspectors verify the statements on the quantities
o f water intake, pollutions discharges and impose penalties for breach o f any agreements
including cases o f unauthorized water intakes, discharge o f pollutants including discharge
o f pollutants as a result o f industrial accidents or problems with machinery.

In cities the charges for water use supply and sewage charges are fixed and collected by
rayon water supply agency, which is an integral part o f housing-and-communal services
agencies. The tariffs are to be approved by the municipal housing-and-communal services
agency, the Khukumat and the local anti-monopoly committee. While household
consumers pay for water supply service, the Constitution does not allow for charges when
water is used as a resource. So till recently water used for irrigation purposes, which
accounted for 85% o f all water use, was not charged. However, now all farms, agricultural
and industrial entities are subject to payments for water supplied through the irrigation
systems.

In principle the households are supposed to pay for the volume of water consumed. But
since the water supply agencies do not have meters to measure the amount o f water
consumed it is estimated based on the number o f people living in each dwelling unit and
the average per capita consumption. Currently water tariff rates inthe country are so low
that it may not even cover the costs o f water meters. Further the low-income groups are
either exempted from payment of water tariffs or are given preferentialrates dependingon
their annual household income.

The current tariff structure for water and sewage i s so low that the revenues do not cover
the operating, let alone the maintenance costs. For instance the Dushanbe Water Supply
Agency (Dushanbe "Vodokanal") reports that the water consumption charges collected
from all types o f consumers constitute 63% o f its revenues and that it i s significantly less
than the operating and maintenance costs o f the water supply and sewage infrastructure.
The current tariff structures do not adequately reflect the value of water and do not
promote efficient use o f water resources for household consumption, irrigation and
industrial uses.

The system o f charges for discharge o f pollutants into water and their reporting are similar
to those applied for air pollution. The chargeable pollutants cover 197 chemical
compounds including 101 different kinds o f pesticides. An entity has to report to the State
Committee for Statistics and Agency for Water Disposal and Sewage Discharge the
quantity o f pollutants discharged into water bodies and into sewage. However, such data
on discharges and the charges collected are not available. The current system o f charges
for pollutant discharges does not promote economically efficient outcomes for pollution
reduction.

                                                 82

Poaching has been prohibited in the country and there are penalties for violation.
Penalties, especially for poaching species under extinction, are the highest o f all ecological
penalties. Inorder to determine the penalties, coefficients are established for each species.
The total penalty is calculated as the coefficient multiplied by the minimum monthly
remuneration (7 somoni per month). For example, the coefficient for a Pamir wild ram and
Bukhara mountain wild ram is estimated at 4,000 somoni, and the total penalty charged per
each ram i s equal to 28,000 somoni (or $9,300). Similarly, the coefficient for a snow
leopard, red wolf and Bukhara reindeer i s equal to 2,000 somoni and for a brown bear the
coefficient i s 1,000 somoni. The jaegers (huntsmen) are held responsible for preservation
o f species under threat o f extinction and imposing and collecting poaching penalties. The
collected penalties, by rule, are to be transferred to the local ecological Fund. However,
the accounts of such transfers of penalties collected, to the ecological fund are not
available.

Mining and use o f mineral resources require formal licenses. The Government issues
licenses for mineral resources such as oil, natural gas, metallic ores and precious stones;
the licenses for mining less valuable mineral resources (sand, clay and gravel) being the
responsibility o f Khukumats (local authorities). The license fees are estimated as a % o f
the value of the mined mineral. The fees vary from 1 to 5 % for ferrous metals and 2 to 4
% for building materials (gravel, sand and clay) to 4 to 8 % for non-ferrous metals and
precious stones. All fees collected are divided equally between state (government) and
local budgets.

Thus the main problems inenforcement are the problems with the institutional setup inthe
country and lack o f economic incentives to reduce pollutions. Although the government
has proposed a few economic incentives, lack o f institutions and laws and legislations to
implement them have prevented the implementation of the proposals.                  The main
constraints o f the environmental agencies are:

    o lack of enough resources to runinspections and guarantee compliance, quality staff
        and independence;
    o lack of clear and concise rules and procedures for inspections, including
        demarcation o f responsibilities at the central and local levels;
    o poor coordination at all levels and lack ofexchange o finformation among staff;
    o lack ofuniform qualifications, national standards, licensing structure and incentives
        for improving technical skills for inspectors.

7.5 Economic incentives for pollution reduction

It has been observed that some o f the initiatives for economic incentives are not supported
with laws and mechanisms to implement them.               One example is the case o f the
Environmental Insurance Fund. Although the law provides for such a fund, it was never
created. The law sets forth tax credits for the entities willing to use low-waste and no-
waste technologies regardless o f their form o f ownership and for entities involved in the
recycling or similar environment-friendly business. However, the Tax Code i s not
reformed to incorporate such provisions. Similarly although it has been proposed to
encourage commercial banks to advance low-rate loans to environment-conscious
businesses, such provisions have not beenmade inthe lendinglaws.


                                              83

The local authorities have not been successful in using additional economic stimuli to
encourage environment friendly business/production practices. Some documents mention
the need to use economic instruments for environment protection and expenses. The
National Strategy and Action Plan o f Nature Conservation and Rational Use of
Biodiversity approved by the Government in September 2003 i s another initiative to
promote economic instruments for sustainable use o f natural resources, in particular,
biodiversity protection including potential sources o f preferential financing for such
activities. The measures proposed under this initiative are tax incentives for activities .that
promote biodiversity protection-including those investments in roads and power
transmission lines, mechanism o f mandatory insurance o f technologies impacting
environment, better financing opportunities for investments that promote biodiversity
protection, and fees for traversing and visiting o f protected areas. The government, in
2001, developed a draft concept on Rational Use and Protection of Water, but has not
made significant progress with this initiative.

7.6 Fundingfor environmentalprotection

There has beena proposal to increase the allocations to the environmental sector to at least
5 % o f the total government expenditures by the year 2010. Another recommendation i s to
allocate a portion o f funds earmarked for privatization to environmental protection.
However, the share o f environmental expenditures in the total government expenditures
continues to be trivial and i s about 0.31 %.

Tajikistan receives environment related funding from both domestic and international
sources.      The domestic sources include budget and extra-budget allocations from
government and local budgets, and investments by state and private entities. In addition to
the above, the government investsinenvironment related projects jointly with international
organizations.     For instance in 2004 the Tajik government's share in the World Bank
Project to secure the Sarez Lake and to rehabilitate the water supply system in Dushanbe
city was 130,000 somoni. In addition to the direct funding for the environment, the state
budget also allocates funds to ecological agencies and other ministries, government
structures and local governments for ecological purposes. There is practically no
information in respect o f ecological expenditures. Although the total ecological funding,
including funding o f local departments, has been growing its share in the total budget still
remains at a low level, around 0.3 1 %.

The Ministry of Finance manages the accounts o f the Ecological Fund.24The ecological
agencies make proposals for investment and other activities with projected expenditures.
The Ministry o f Finance approves the proposals and expenditures prior to allocating the
funds. Beginning November 1998 all transfers to Ecological Funds are deposited on
accounts o f local government and ecological agencies. Local governments have their own
budgetsfor ecological funds (the expected revenuesand their expenditure per each item) to
be approved by Khukumats (local authorities).




24Until November 1998 the Ministry for Nature Protectionwas authorized to directly manageand allocate
funds. The Government has changed the system with a view to intensifying the supervisionof reporting on
financial operationsand disposalof funds for ecological purposes.

                                                    84

All revenues for ecological funds are raised in rayons and oblast cities. The revenues
raised are allocated on the following principle: 60% o f funds remain at rayon or city for
disposal; 30% are transferred to the oblast fund and the remaining 10% to the government
ecological fund. O f all funds transferred to ecological funds which have been raised in
rayons and cities and inDushanbe 60% remain at the disposal o f a rayon or a city and 40%
are transferred to the state ecological fund (of which 30% i s reserved for ecological activity
in the region which transferred such funds). All transfers are taxable at 10 %, the tax
revenuesbeingtransferred to the State Budget.

There i s no data on spending from the ecological funds at the national level. A review o f
the available accounts showed that the expenditures of ecological funds are not itemized.
However, there i s some limiteddata on individual regional funds. According to Dushanbe
and Sughd oblast departments 60 % o f the funds are allocated to fund specific ecological
projects and the remaining 40 % are usedto meet administrative and other needs o f local
committees. However, the current regulation does not specify the proportion o f
expenditures that should be allocated to ecological activities and for administrative
purposes.

Inthe year 2003, the city of Dushanbe Ecological Fund received 151,000 somoni which
was spent to purchase refuse containers for two districts in the city, finance programs o f
ecological training (sponsorship o f TV programs, publishing o f ecological newspaper),
plant young trees, purchase o f monitoring facilities and special shoes for inspectors, to
celebrate Environment Day (including ecological awards; purchase o f a vehicle for
inspectors; purchase o f office stationery). The Fund's monetary facilities were also used to
remunerate officers o f ecological traffic inspectorate who supervise and control exhaust
systems o f vehicles and disclose facts of illegal logging o f trees. In addition to the above
expenditures, 29 employees o f the Dushanbe department are remunerated out o f the
committee's budget (including eight employees o f four district committees).

7.7 Privatization and environmental governance

Although privatization inTajikistan can be traced back to 1991, it gained momentum only
in 1997 after the adoption of Law on Privatization of State Property. The above law
specified the general principles and terms and conditions for privatization o f state property
in the country.    It also provided guidelines on responsibilities o f different government
authorities to facilitate privatization and assignment o f revenues gained in consequence o f
privatization and provision of information to mass media. In order to further speed up
privatization the government adopted by-laws like the 1997 Regulation on Auctioning and
Tendering Objects o f Privatization, the 1998 Regulation on Privatizing Entities and the
1997 Decree on Objects not Subject to Privatization and Objects Subject to Privatization
upon the Government Decision (amendments).

In 2003, the Strategic Scheme of privatizing medium and large-scale entities and
restructuring natural monopolies (large-scale entities in particular) was approved by the
Government which replaced all previous legislations for privatization. The Strategic
Scheme that i s currently in effect, provided conditions for further promotion o f market
reforms and development o f the private sector, inflow of domestic and foreign investments
and increasing job opportunities with little pressure on the State Budget.


                                              85

There were some public entities that are not subject to Strategic Scheme for privatization.
Inthe case of such entities, the government has constituted a Task Forceconsistingofficers
o f appropriate ministries and government agencies, whose purpose ,is to analyze business
performance o f an entity and its competitiveness and to seek potential buyers thereof and
arrange auctions (tenders). The task force is entrusted with the responsibility for analysis
o f an entity's liabilities in respect o f environmental protection and collection o f relevant
information and documents like certificates, licenses, permits, materials o f legal cases
(proceedings) pertaining to entities using natural resources; disposal o f sewage; air, water
and soil pollution.

It may, however, be noted that the legislationdid not adequately address the environmental
impacts o f privatization.     Information as to how entities comply with environmental
regulation and the previous environmental liabilities if any are not given due consideration
inprivatizationlegislations. For instance, any outstanding liabilities to the Ecological Fund
are not considered inthe valuation o f the entity when it is beingappraised.

The State Committee for Management o f State Property set up in 1997 is responsible for
privatization o f state-owned entities. Besides supervisingthe process o f privatization, it has
been authorized to coordinate the activity o f ministries, state committees and local
governments in matters o f privatization o f both national and municipal property. It was
also authorized to take part in establishing exchanges and other structures dealing with
privatization and to promote the government policy in respect o f arranging investments.
The local (oblast, city and rayon) committees on management o f state-owned property are
responsible for privatization o f small- and medium-size entities within theirjurisdiction.

Although the Law on Privatization o f State-Owned Property guarantees transparency and
access to up-to-date information on privatization, it is neither easily accessible nor
available inpractice. The web site o f the State Committee on Management o f State-Owned
Property has information only until the first quarter o f 1999. So far privatization has not
brought expected results with many o f privatized entities.

There i s no information on the effects o f privatization on environment in the country; in
particular on investments made by privatized entities in improved production technologies,
rehabilitation o f gas-cleaning facilities or investment in modern equipment. According to
some o f ecological agencies in Sughd Oblast the newly privatized companies observe the
ecological legislation better than the state-owned entities including the payment of
ecological charges, ecological expertise charges and fulfillment o f inspectors' instructions
pertaining to improvement o f the ecological situation. Local ecological agencies are not
involved in the process o f privatization though they are authorized to inspect entities prior
to and after privatization.

The environmental/ecological agencies are not obliged to disclose to new owners any
information in respect o f the entities' outstanding ecological debts not covered in the
appraisal or the absence, if any, o f permits or certificates o f ecological expertise though
they can provide such information if requested. As a result new owners o f entities often
have to meet ecological claims the existence o f which has not been disclosed to them.
Pursuant to the Strategic Scheme for privatization there are privatized large entities and
natural monopolies whose products though economically essential are hazardous to the
environment. However, the legislation and existing practices do not guarantee that

                                                86

privatization o f those large entities and natural monopolies shall not cause harmful
environmental impacts.

Currently privatization in Tajikistan is coming to its final stage and the largest entities and
natural monopolies are scheduled for privatization and restructuring in four years. The
analysis undertaken for the study found that the state environmental agencies are not
involved inthe process o f privatization o f small, medium or large-scale entities. As a result
there is no system under which all ecological charges and liabilities of an entity being
privatized as well as liabilities o f a new owner thereof in respect o f improving the
ecological situation would be contractually specified.

7.8 Opportunitiesfor improvementin environmentalgovernance

Environmental governance suffers mainly due to lack o f efficient institutions, poor
coordination among them and inadequate economic incentives for improved environmental
performance. There are opportunities for improving environmental performance in the
country, some o f which are outlined below:

       Transparency in receipts and allocation o f funds- the accounts o f the funds do not
       provide details o f the receipts from the different entities, NGOs and public at large.
       The accounts do not provide details spending for different activities as well. Better
       transparency in receipts and expenditures are needed for improved planning and
       prospects for funding inthe future;
       Need for economic incentives for more efficient use o f resources: the current
       system o f tariffs does not promote economic efficiency intheir use. An example is
       the tariff structure for water.    Although the law on nature protection proposes
       different tax incentives for environment friendly economic activities, their
       implementation i s constrained by lack o f appropriate by-laws. For example, the
       Tax Code does not provide for reduced tax rates for companies which invest in
       ecologically acceptable technologies although the law on nature protection
       proposes such incentives;
       The current system o f pollution charges does not provide enough incentives for
       pollution reduction. Under the current system o f pollution charges it is cheaper to
       pay charges and penalties than investing in pollution reduction; important
       components o f air pollution (PMIO, PM2.5) are not regulated.
       There is a needto improve the infrastructure for monitoring and emissions and fix
       liabilities on the polluters. The facilities currently available are not sufficient to
       enforce the pollution charges;
       Provision o f adequate and timely information on environmental performance, with
       effective legal mechanisms and management tools concentrating more on pollution
       prevention rather than clean-up;
       Effective legal systems and norms to monitor and enforce laws and regulations
       regardingpollution from manufacturing industries;
       Measures to preventuncontrolled use o f natural resources resultingindepletion and
       degradation. For instance, the existing land use practices do not consider the actual
       resource capacities, productivity and spatial diversity which in turn results in
       degradation;



                                              87

 . Development of an effective system of waste management (collection, disposaland
   recycling) system and improving effective environmental monitoring, particularly
    near waste management sites and landfills;
9. Development of legal system to protect biological and landscape diversity and
    development of better database on biodiversity inthe country;
10. Reforms in setting Maximum Permissible Discharge of hazardous wastes for each
   pollutant (mostly into water bodies) or source based on environmental standards
   that are realistic from economical and technical perspective;
11. There are opportunities for better coordination of different stakeholders to achieve
    improved environmental performance. Preconditions for better involvement of
   private sector and the civil society in sustainable development and protection of the
   environment should be created .

VIII. Conclusionsand Recommendations

This section first presents a summary of the estimated costs of environmental damages in
the country. It then presentsa case for strengtheninginstitutions and to promote economic
incentives for pollution reduction and efficient use o f resources.

Costs of EnvironmentalDamage
The analysis showed that costs o f environmental damages are significant in Tajikistan
accounting for about 9.5 % o f its GDP in 2006.            The highest damage is from land
degradation, including soil erosion and salinity, the cost o f which accounts for 3.7 % o f the
GDP, followed by natural disasters (1.6 % o f GDP) and then costs due to inadequate water
supply, sanitation and hygiene (1.5 % of GDP). The cost o f indoor air pollution and
associated health risk i s about 1 % o f the GDP; rangeland degradation (0.7 % o f GDP) cost
o f urban outdoor air pollution (0.5 %), lead poisoning (0.2 %) and deforestation (0.2 %).
The above estimates show the urgency in reversing the course of environmental damages
inthe country for sustainable economic growthand poverty reduction.

The analysis found that land degradation is the principal environmental problem in the
country the main causes o f which are irrigation-related land degradation, in particular
secondary salinity, water-logging and irrigation-related soil erosion, soil erosion in rain-fed
farmlands, degradation o f pastures and forests and related loss o f biodiversity and other
forms o f land degradation as a result o f natural disasters and soil contamination.

The second major environmental damage is from periodical natural disasters such as
floods, landslides, avalanches, and storms, and severe earthquakes the total costs o f which
accounts for about 1.6 % o f the GDP. The costs associated with inadequate water supply,
sanitation and hygiene include costs o f mortality and morbidity from Diarrhea, Hepatitis
A, Typhoid and Paratyphoid and averting expenditures associated with household boiling
o f drinking water. Indoor air pollution i s mainly due to use o f traditional fuels (mainly
cotton stalks); acute respiratory illness in children represents 40 % o f cost; respiratory
child mortality represents 34 %; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality in adult
females and ARI morbidity in adult females represent 13 % o f cost each. Rural population
bears 93 % o f the total cost o f indoor air pollution.

Degradation o f rangelands is due to improper land use practices, denudation o f vegetation
becasue o f indiscriminate grazing practices exacerbated by intermittent draughts leading to
desertification. The communal nature o f farming and the tragedy o f the commons lead to
overgrazing and degradation o f grazing lands. The damages due to urban air pollution that
constitute about 0.5 % o f the GDP are from deterioration in air quality as a result o f
particulate matter.

Estimate o f costs associated with lead exposure i s based on the loss o f intelligence quotient
and mid mental retardation. As there i s considerable uncertainty about the data on lead
levels in blood in urban population as a whole (and the rural population) in Tajikistan, the
estimates presentedhere are only for the children under 5 in urban population o f the cities
with more than 100 thousand inhabitants. It does not include MMR health expenses
(doctor visits, medication cost and time losses o f care givers), reduced life expectancy due
to MMR and health effects related to lead exposure such as elevated blood pressure,

                                                89

gastroenterological effects, and anemia. The costs o f deforestation include direct and
indirect use values and non-use values. The direct use values include costs associated with
fuel-wood production, non-timber products and tourism and recreation uses. The nonuse
values include option values and existence values. It may be noted that forest cover only
about 3 % o f the total geographical area and hence the marginal costs o f deforestation
tends be higher inthe country.

Climate change costs were not quantified in the report due to the lack o f consistent
scenarios o f negative impacts. On the qualitative level it is proved that increasing
temperature and changing precipitation patterns are major reasons for recent extreme
weather events in Tajikistan. Changing climate leads to glaciers retreat, water shortages,
increase frequency and magnitude o f natural disasters, alters hydropower development and
increases pressure on agriculture. Human health and ecosystems will be affected in the
long run. Further analysis i s needed to estimate annual losses due to climate change given
current uncertainty o f the climate models.

Institutionsand EnvironmentalGovernance
The constitution declares that the State undertakes to ensure a healthier environment and
guarantee the efficient use o f natural resources for the benefit o f the people o f Tajikistan.
The environment protection law stipulates several types o f controls and institutions to
comply with at the state, ministerial, business and community levels. At the national level
there is an environmental block, the Department o fNature Use and Protection, chaired by a
Deputy Minister under the Ministry o f Agriculture and Nature Protection.                       The State
Control Service o f Natural Resources and Environmental Protection under the Department
o f Nature Use and Protection i s the national level agency for environmental affairs in the
country.25

Inaddition to the SCSNREP, the Sanitary Inspection Service of the Ministry of Health and
Inspection Service on Mining Safety by the Ministry o f Mines are involved in
environmental management. At the ministerial level enforcement is done by different line
ministries and the state agencies under them with no effective coordination across the line
ministries. In addition to the state level and ministerial level controls there is a business
level control that implies that every business has to observe the environmental law.
Although the government has set norms for air and water pollution, residual traces o f
chemicals and biologically harmful microbes in food, regulations regarding noise, vibration
and magnetic fields- exceeding the threshold levels results in administrative actions and
financial sanctions-their implementation remains unsatisfactory due mainly to weak
institutions to implement them and lack o f coordination, vertical and horizontal, across
institutions.

Strengthening institutions and defining specijk roles
The preceding analysis found that the binding constraints for improved environmental
performance in the country are: (i)weak institutional design (ii)lack o f coordination


25The other agencies under the Departmentof NatureUse and Protectionare Agency on Hydrometeorology
and Anti-hail service, Agency on Forestryand Hunting, Tajik Scientific Research Institute of Nature Use and
Forestry, Scientific-ResearchCenter on Water ResourcesProtection, Scientific-ResearchLaboratory on
Nature Protection, State Departmenton specially protectedareas "Tajik National Park", Scientific-
ProductionCenter "Tabiat" and the State Enterprise, "Saidu Sayokhat".

                                                    90

among institutions; (iii)lack o f economic incentives for pollution reduction and
accountability; (iv) capacity limitations; (v) poor environmental governance and (v)
insufficient funding for environmental management. The solutions to these problems will
not arise from simply scaling up the institutions and or funding for environmental
management, but require careful planning and coordination at all levels backed by legal
and regulatory mechanisms.

Both federal and provincial governments share concurrent legislative authority and
responsibility for environmental management and efficient use o f natural resources. In
order to achieve better outcomes, institutions at all levels should have appropriate roles and
responsibilities.  At the national level the roles could include: (a) Setting national
environmental policy and defining specific goals for environmental quality; (b) providing
resources, both technical and financial, and oversight for local/provincial environmental
authorities; (c) reporting and publishing data on progress in meeting the national
environmental objectives. The national environmental agency should have the mandate for
enforcement o f national laws and regulations and oversight on local/provincial
environmentalagencies.

While the national level agency sets the national policy, responsibilities o f the provincial
environmental authorities could include environmental clearance at the local level,
implementation and compliance as well as monitoring o f ambient environmental quality
standards. There i s also need for specific guidelines for federal oversight o f the provincial
environmental authorities depending on the provincial laws and regulations for
enforcement, adequacy o f technical expertise, staff and resources.

Institutional coordinationfor better environmental outcomes
The SCSNREP is responsible for the coordination o f environmental management at all
levels and across ministries. However, the preceding analysis shows poor coordination,
both along vertical and horizontal levels. The poor coordination results in problems with
inspections and enforcement o f set standards and charges. Although the government
enacted a number o f laws and proposals to improve the state o f the environment there is
very limited state capacity for policy development and implementation.

Economic incentives
Tajikistan has a set o f economic incentives in the form o f charges and payments for waste
products generated and pollutant discharges in to air and water bodies.           The analysis
however showed that the charges for waste collection are not sufficient to stimulate
reduction in wastes and development and adoption o f environment friendly production
technologies that reduce waste generation. In the case o f air and water pollution, current
system o f payments is not economically efficient as it does not provide enough economic
incentives to reduce emissions. Automobile emissions constitute another main source o f
air pollution. The government charges an automobile tax that does not promote fuel
efficiency and emission reductions.
Quantity restrictions

Inaddition to prices and charges, the government has enforced quantity restrictions on the
amount o f wastes and pollutants that can be discharged into air and water. There are also

used by individual business entities. However, the enforcement o f these restrictions is
constrained by the available infrastructure for monitoring and enforcement.

Recommendations

The analysis revealed that there are opportunities for improving environmental sector and
its performance in the country. The cost o f environmental degradation reveals the focus
areas for such an improvement. For the nearest future, major focus should be on water
resources management, which has critical importance for the productivity of agriculture,
the prevention of human healthrisks, andenergy security inTajikistan. Inlonger term, the
cost o f environmental degradation will be exacerbated by climate change. Also, the
priorities may be shifted overtime. Therefore, the improvement o f monitoring, information
systems, and forward looking risk analysis are essential. Due to multimedia and
multidisciplinary character o f the underlying problems, there is a need for robust
interagency coordination. Along with strengthening o f SCSNREP other agencies may also
play an important role, for example: the State Committee for Emergency, the Water
Management Authorities, and the Ministry o f Energy         At the same time, mitigation o f
environmental degradation costs should be closely linked with poverty alleviation strategy
o f Tajikistan (PRS).

Immediate measures should include improvement o f appropriate soil and water
conservation coupled with efficient irrigation water manangement practices through
improvement o f the canal and drainage infrastructure where it i s viable. This i s essential
for sustaining and increasing the farm production both in mountain areas and valley lands
Furthermore, reducing chemical contamination o f surface and groundwater also i s an
equally important aspect. Rangeland and pasture land improvement i s important to
enhance the income levels o f the farming communities in the mountain area. Improved
irrigation water use policy in combination with improved land management practice o f the
rainfed lands will reduce vulnerability to natural disasters. Taking into account specifics o f
Tajikistan, access to potable water and alternative energy sources like small hydropower
will create highest value added with respect to mitigation o f the current and future
environmental degradation cost. Also, small hydro and improved stoves programs are
important in reducing indoor air pollution related to solid fuels used for cooking. These
and other recommendations related to general improvement o f institutions and
management are summarized inthe table below.

In the longer term it is important to develop coordinated water management - irrigation
and power generation plans, enhancing cross country coordination and electricity trade, as
well as incorporating risk assessment policies across the various ministries and functional
areas, from development planning to watershed management and hydro power projects. At
the same time there is a need for follow-up work to do a more detailed analysis on which
policies and investmentswould provide the largest benefits.

Annex 1. L a w on Nature Protection

The Tajikistan Law on Nature Protection warrants the polluter to pay for the damages based on
the national principle "he who pollutes shall pay". The polluters shall be charged for industrial
waste and disposal thereof within and beyond the allowable pollution limits. In the case o f
natural resources the guiding principle i s "he who uses shall pay" whereby the users o f natural
resources shall pay for the right to utilize resources within the established limits and beyond the
limits. The Law specifies the following economic instrumentsfor environmental protection and
natural resource management:

        Payments for use o f natural resources;
        Payments for disposal o f pollutants;
        Payments for elimination o f waste and other kinds o f pollutants;
        Preferential o f tax and interest rates for entities usingpure technologies;
        Penalties for damage inflicted on the environment and human health and compensation to
        those affected;
        Additional taxation o f entities whose activity is hazardous to the environment.

The Law also allows local governments to use any other economic incentives for environmental
protection.

The Law provides for three sources o f funding activities aimed at environmental protection:
government and local budgets; government and local funds o f nature protection; voluntary
contributions o f physical and legal persons. The nature protection funds have been established
for the purpose o f funding environmental protection and to provide compensation for damages
inflicted to nature. In addition to the government fmds and voluntary contributions the charges
for use o f natural resources; disposal and elimination o f waste and pollutants; penalties for
violation o f the ecological legislation; voluntary contributions also contribute to the
environmental fund.

The Government determines the amounts of payments, methods o f their estimation and
collection, penalties and charges for the use o f natural resources and environmental pollution;
besides it prescribes the procedure o f establishing ecological funds and o f the disposal o f their
funds. In Tajikistan all kinds of charges including those payable for environmental pollution
beyond the established limits are called payments; the term "penalty" is used exclusively for an
individual liability inaccordance with OSCE terminology nomenclature and includes all kinds o f
payments chargeable to companies and individuals for pollutions beyond the established limits.
The term "pollution charges" means payments for environmental pollution (including waste
disposal) within the established limits; "payment for services" means payments for services
rendered such as water supply; "charges" are payments for licenses and permits. All payments,
charges and penalties shall be indexedin accordance with inflation rates.

Inorder to implementthe Law on Nature Protectionthe government has passeda a few decrees
and regulations, which together developed the following framework:




                                                   102

        The procedure o f charging payments for environmental pollution, pollution disposal and
their margins as approved by the Council of Ministers in 1993 and subsequent instructions
prescribe a practical guide on use o f economic instruments;
        The guiding document on nature protection "Methodological Instructions on Collection
o f Charges for Environmental Pollution'' (PA-01-93) specifies a procedure and methods o f
calculating various payments and charges for environmental pollution. The 2001 additions and
amendments thereto prescribe new tariffs payments for waste disposal and elimination thereof
and details other payments, collections and compensation for environmental damage with due
regard for inflation rates as provided for in Law on Environmental Protection. The documents
aforementioned were issued by the then Ministry o f Nature Protection and approved by the
Ministry o f Economics and Commerce and the Ministry o f Finance.
        The 1998 Regulation on Government and Local Funds for Nature Protectionspecifies the
sources o f funding, allocates the payments received to local and government Funds and outlines
the purposes oftheir disposal.

The Law on Nature Protection determines economical instruments for air pollution control
including the sources o f funding thereof as well as charges for air pollution (withinand beyond
established limits). The Law on Management o f Production Waste specifies that the waste
management payments depend on the volume o f wastes and their toxicity category. Both Laws
are complemented with GuidingDocument RD-01-03 (see above), which regulates the payment
procedure.

 The Law on Natural Resources contains provisions pertaining to payments for geological
prospecting and mining o f mineral resources. The precise procedure o f collecting payments i s
provided in regulations on the amount, manner and terms o f collecting payments for disposal o f
natural resources and inRegulations on licensing the right to use such resources.

The Water Code contains provisions of charges for disposal o f pollutants in water bodies and
compensation for damage to water resources. The water users who are engaged in socially
beneficial activity aimed at rational disposal and protection o f water resources are remunerated
according to the procedure o f awarding premiums. Such activities includethe development and
implementation o f technologies for economical disposal o f wastes into water resources,
advanced technologies f sewage purification, construction o f water purification facilities, closed
water supply systems and implementation o f processes preventingthe accumulation o f sewage.
There are no special national or local funds for payment o f premiums for such activity although
the additional investments may be needed to initiate such environment friendly activities. The
money therefore is supposed to be provided by entities which i s possible only in the event that
the activity aforesaid has allowedthem to make sufficient savings.

                     people of the importance of rational use of resources
                     and best ways to doing it. The program provides a
                     detailed description of the environment and its
                     ecological problems, set forth a number of types of

 Annex 3. Methodologyfor Health Cost Estimation

 1.ParticulateMatter Pollution

 Research in the United States in the 1990s and most recently by Pope et a1 (2002) provides
 strong evidence that it is even smaller particulates (PM 2.5) that have the largest health effects.
 The gaseous pollutants (S02, NOx, CO, and ozone) are generally not thought to be as damaging
 as fine particulates. However, SO2 and NOx may have important health consequences because
 they can react with other substances inthe atmosphereto form particulates.

 Dose Response Coefficients

 Inorder to estimate the health impacts, we have usedrecent work by Ostro (1994), Abbey et a1
 (1995) and Pope et al (2002). Ostro (1994) and Abbey et a1 (1995) have used dose response
 coefficients to analyze the morbidity effects and provides estimates of dose response of P M
 (PM10) to chronic bronchitis. A survey o f the current status of worldwide research shows that
 the risk ratios or dose response Coefficients from Pope et a1 (2002) are likely to be the best
 available evidence of the mortality effects of ambient particulate pollution (PM 2.5). These
 coefficients were applied by the WHO in the World Health Report 2002, which provided a
 global estimate of the health effects of environmental risk factors. The mortality and morbidity
 coefficients from the above studies are presentedinTable A.3.1.

 coefficients.

 Pope et a1 (2002) provide the most comprehensive and detailed research study to date on the
 relationship between air pollution and mortality.             The study confirms and strengthens the
 evidence of the long-term mortality effects of particulate pollution found by Pope et a1 (1995)
 and Dockery et a1 (1993). Pope et a1 (2002) utilized ambient air quality data from metropolitan
 areas across the United States for the two periods 1979-83 and 1999-2000, and information on
 certified causes of mortality of adults from the American Cancer Society (ACS) database over a
period of 16 years. The ACS database has individual specific information for more than 1
million adults that were obtainedthrough questionnaires. The study could therefore control for a
 large set of factors that may also affect variations in mortality rates across metropolitan areas,




                                                       117

such as age, smoking behavior, education, marital status, body weight, occupational risk factors,
and dietary indices.

 The study found a statistically significant relationship between levels o f P M 2.5 and mortality
rates, controlling for all the factors discussed above. All-cause mortality was found to increase
by 4-6 % for every 10 ug/m3increase inP M 2.5. The increase in cardiopulmonary mortality was
6-9 %, and 8-14 % for lung cancer. No statistically significant relationship was found between
levels o f P M 2.5 and all other causes o f mortality (Table A.3.2).

The share o f cardiopulmonary and lung cancer deaths in total mortality varies sometimes
substantially across countries. It may therefore reasonably be expected that the risk ratios for
cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality provide more reliable estimates o f mortality from
P M 2.5 than the risk ratio for all-cause mortality when the risk ratios are applied to countries
other than the United States. The former two risk ratios are therefore used in this report. The
mortality coefficient in Table A.3.1 i s a combination o f the cardiopulmonary and lung cancer
mortality risk ratios inTable A.3.2.




Reproduced from Pope et a1(2002).

In order to use the mortality coefficients in Table 3.1.2 to estimate mortality from urban air
pollution in the Tajik cities, baseline data on total annual cardiopulmonary and lung cancer
deaths are required. For Dushanbe and Khujand, data on estimates o f total urban death were
obtained from the UNstatistical data (5.6 per 1000)27.Inaddition to the above data, estimates o f
mortality due to cardiopulmonary and lung cancer from the Ministry o f Health combined with
WHO data by the cause o f deaths were also used. Data from the above two sources showed an
average rate o f 56 % o f total deaths due to cardiopulmonary and lung cancer. Inorder to estimate
the mortality effects, a threshold level of 7.5 ug/m3o fP M2.5 has beenapplied, below which it is
assumed there are no mortality effects. The World Health Report 2002 (WHO) also used this
procedure. No threshold level has beenapplied for morbidity.

An estimate of annual incidence o f Chronic Bronchitis (CB) is requiredinorder to apply the CB
coefficient in Table A.3.1. In the absence o f data on CB incidence for Tajikistan, we have used
the rate from WHO (2001) and Shibuya et a1 (2001) for the Euro B region of WHO of which
Tajikistan is part of. It has therefore not beenpossible to use city specific CB incidence rates.

Other morbidity health endpoints considered are hospital admissions o f patients with respiratory
problems, emergency room visits (or hospital out-patient visits), restricted activity days, lower
respiratory infections in children, and respiratory symptoms. The coefficients are expressed as

 cases per 100,000 in the absence o f incidence data for Tajikistan, though it would be preferable
 to have incidence data and use coefficients that reflect %age change in incidence. Increases in
 asthma attacks among asthmatics have also been related to air pollution in many studies. But
 such data are on the %age o f the population that is asthmatic and frequencies o f asthma attacks
 are not readily available for Tajikistan.

 The health effects o f air pollution are converted to disability adjusted life years (DALYs) to
 facilitate a comparison to health effects from other environmental risk factors. DALYs per 10
 thousand cases o f various health end-points are presentedinTable A.3.3.

 Table A.3.4 presents the disability weights and average duration o f illness used in this report to
 calculate the DALYs as presented in Table A.3.5. The weights for Lower Respiratory Illness
 (LRI) and Chronic Bronchitis (CB) are average disability weights.28 Disability weights for the
 other morbidity end-points are not readily available, and are estimates by Larsen (2004a) based
 on weights for other comparable illnesses.29 Average duration o f CB i s estimated based on age '
 distribution in Tajikistan and age-specific CB incidence in Shibuya et a1 (2001). Years lost to
 premature mortality from air pollution is estimated from age-specific mortality data for
 cardiopulmonary and lung cancer deaths, and have been discounted at 3 % per year. Average
 duration o f illness for the other health end-points i s from Larsen (2004a).

The total annual costs were computed from the total cost per case (Table A.3.5) and the number
o f estimated cases. For morbidity the cost o f illness alone has been estimated. In the case o f
respiratory symptoms, the estimated cost per occurrence i s zero and hence the total annual
estimated cost due to respiratory symptoms inTable A.3.5 i s zero.

The baseline data that were used to estimate the cost per case of illness is presented in Table'
A.3.6. The opportunity cost o f time lost because o f illness for adults i s estimated based on urban
wages. The average urban wage in Tajikistan i s about 120 TJS per month. In the case of both
income earning and non-income earning individuals, 75 % o f the average urban wage rate has
been imputed as the opportunity cost o f time lost due to illness. In the case o f non-income

There is very little information about the frequency o f doctor visits, emergency visits and
hospitalization for CB patients in developing countries. However, Schulman et a1 (2001) and
Niederman et a1 (1999) provide some information on frequency o f doctor visits, emergency visits
and hospitalization for CB patients inUnited States and Europe.30 Inthe absence o f specific data
on Tajikistan, results from the above studies have been applied to Tajikistan. Estimated lost
workdays per year are based on frequency o f estimated medical treatment plus an additional 7
days for each hospitalization and one extra day for each doctor and emergency visits. These
days are added together to reflect the total time needed for recovery from illness.

To estimate the cost o f a new case o f CB, the medical cost and value o f time losses have been
discounted over 20 year duration o f illness. An annual real increase o f 2 % in medical cost and
value o f time lost has been applied to reflect an average expected increase in annual labor
productivity and real wages. The costs are discounted at 3 % per year, a rate commonly applied
by WHO for health effects.

2. Lead Exposure

We do not have data on the concentration o f lead in the atmosphere. However, according to
experts there the lead concentration exceeds safe limits and results in substantial health impacts.
There are also significant accumulations o f lead insoil and water already that could have impacts
on health. The figure A.3.1 presentsthe major sources for lead exposure. The main indicator o f
lead exposure effect is the level o f lead in the blood. WHO (Fewtrell et al, 2003) recommends
that lead concentration in blood (BLL) i s the best indicator to analyze the health impacts o f
exposure to lead pollution as lead from different exposure pathways accumulates in blood. Table
A.3.7 presents a summary o f health effects o f lead.

We do not have data on lead levels in blood in Tajikistan. So data from countries in NIS with
same specifications for lead in gasoline are used. They are Uzbekistan(Semenov& Mutalova,
2004); and Kazakhstan (Kaul, 2000)), in Central Asia and Russia (Rubin et al, 2002). The above
studies showedthat these countries with identical specifications of gasoline have elevatedlevels
of lead in blood among children (see studies mentioned above). The study in Russia further
identifiedleadedgasolineas the mainsource o f leadexposure, ifstationaryindustrial sources are
not locatedinthe city. The table belowpresents major results o fthe studies:

 The above studies showed that inRussia when 23 % of childrenhad elevated lead blood levels,
 whereas only 6 % of children in Uzbekistan had this condition. In order to estimate the cost of
 healtheffects due to lead pollution, the effects on childreninmajor cities with population above
 100,000 inhabitants alone are considered. In the absence of data on lead blood level among
 adults no analysis could be conducted for lead exposure in this population group. There are
 about 0.8 million people inthese cities and about 100thousandchildrenunder 5 years old. Inthe
 case of younger children lead can cause significant neurological deficit, characterized by
 reduction inIQ, as it i s indicatedintable A.3.7.

 Since there were several studies available (Table A.3.8), a single weighted mean level of lead in
 blood (BLL) was generatedby multiplyingthe sample sizes by the natural logarithm of the mean
 BLL for different samples.

 Inorder to quantify the damages from lead exposure, the log-normal distribution of BLL inthe
 population was obtained using the function LOGNORMDIST inthe Excel spreadsheet provided
 by WHO and the results are presentedin Table 3.2.4. 1- LOGNORMDIST gives the proportion
 of the population above a given interval of BLL. This step was repeated for each BLL interval
 above a given value (5 ug/dL, 10 ug/dL, 15 ug/dL, 20 ug/dL, >20 ug/dL, 260 ug/dL, 270 ug/dL,
 280 ug/dL). As in Fewtrell et al, 2003 it is assumed that IQ losses take place during the first 5
 years of a child's life.

 As presented in Fewtrell et al., 2003 the loss of IQ points is quantified by assuming a linear
 dose-response relationship and a loss of 1.3 IQ points per 5ug/dL (Figure A.3.2).

The next step is to convert IQ loss into mild mental retardation(MMR). We estimate incidence
of MMR per 1000 children in the age range 0-4 years old. For this the number of childrenwith
IG loss in each BLL interval estimatedabove is multiplied by the %age of the populationin the
IQ interval.MMR occurs when the IQbelow 70 points but above 50 points (Fewtrell L. et al,
                                                            i s
2003). Followingthe assumptionof normaldistributionof IQ across the population, it is possible
to estimate the population in IQ intervals that would be at risk of MMR, as presented at the
FigureA.3.3 below:

                                                                      level

IQ  (4)                         70-73.50              1.59


The estimated population at risk o f MMR is summed for different I Q bands (table A.3.10) and
then multiplied by the regional MMR adjustment ratio, which is 1.53 for Euro B, the WHO
subregion which includes Tajikistan. Estimated incidence o f MMR due to lead exposure in the
age group 0-4 years old i s at 119 annual cases.

Studies have found an average loss o f 1.3 IQ points per 5 ug/dl BLL in children. Fewtrell et a1
(2003) apply a lower threshold o f 5 ug/dl BLL below which no I Q loss occurs, and an upper
threshold o f 20 ug/dl BLL above which no further IQ losses are expected (Le., a loss of about 3.5
IQ points for BLL > 20 ug/dl). For some children an I Q loss will cause Mild Mental Retardation
(MMR),occurring at an IQ of 50-70 points. Thus children with an IQ of 70.5-73.5 points are at
risk of MMR from lead exposure. It is assumedthat IQ lossestakes place duringthe first 5 years
o f a child's life.

3. Inadeauate Water SuDply, SanitationAnd Hygiene

Esrey et a1 (1991) provides a comprehensive review o f studies documenting this relationship for
diseases such as schistosomiasis (bilharzia), intestinal worms, diarrhea, etc.          Fewtrell and
Colford (2004) provide a meta-analysis o f studies o f water supply, sanitation and hygiene that
updates the findings on diarrheal illness by Esrey et a1 (1991). Water, sanitation and hygiene
factors also influence child mortality. Esrey et a1 (1991) find in their review o f studies that the
median reduction in child mortality from improved water and sanitation i s 55 %. Shi (1999)
provides econometric estimates o f the impact o f potable water and sewerage connection on child
mortality using a data set for about 90 cities around the world. Literacy and education level are
also found to be important determinants o f parental protection o f child health against
environmental risk factors. Esrey and Habicht (1988) reports from a study in Malaysia that
maternal literacy reduces child mortality by about 50 % in the absence o f adequate sanitation, but
only by 5 % in the presence o f good sanitation facilities. Literacy i s also found to reduce child
mortality by 40 % ifpipedwater i s present, suggesting that literate mothers take better advantage
o f water availability for hygiene purposes to protect child health.             Findings from the
Demographic and Health Surveys from around further confirm the role o f literacy in child
mortality reduction. Rutstein (2000) provides a multivariate regression analysis o f infant and
child mortality in developing countries using Demographic and Health Survey data from 56
countries from 1986-98. The study finds a significant relationship between infant and child
mortality rates and piped water supply, flush toilet, maternal education, access to electricity,
medical services, Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT), vaccination, dirt floor in household
dwelling, fertility rates, and malnutrition.      Similarly, Larsen (2003) provides a regression
analysis o f child mortality using national data for the year 2000 from 84 developing countries
representing 95 % o f the total population in the developing world. A statistically significant
relationship between child mortality and access to improved water supply, safe sanitation, and
female literacy i s confirmed.

Baseline health data for estimating the health impacts o f inadequate water supply, sanitation and
hygiene are presented in Table A.3.11,         Data from Medical Statistics Centre o f the Health
Ministry indicates that 12-14 % of child mortality was due to intestinaldiseases in2004. This is
usedas a range for diarrheal mortality estimation.

Inthe case o fdiarrheal morbidity, it is very difficult or practically impossibleto identify all cases
o f diarrhea as a substantial share o f cases i s not treated or does not require treatment at health
facilities, and therefore are never recorded.      Further, those cases that are treated by private
doctors or clinics are often not reported to public health authorities. Household surveys therefore
provide the most reliable indicator o f total cases o f diarrheal illness. Most household surveys,
however, contain only information on diarrheal illness in children. Moreover, the surveys only
reflect diarrheal prevalence at the time o f the survey. As there i s often highvariation in diarrheal
prevalence across seasons o f the year, extrapolation to an annual average will result in either an
over- or underestimate o f total annual cases and correcting this bias i s often difficult without
knowledge o f seasonalvariations.

MICS 2005 also provides data on diarrheal prevalence in children under the age o f five years. It
reports a diarrheal prevalence (preceding two weeks) rate o f 18.6 % in urban areas and 21.5 % in



                                                  127

rural areas. This rate is used to estimate the number o f annual cases per child under-5, and then
the total annual cases inall children under-5. The procedure applied is to multiply the two-week
prevalence rate by 52/2.5 to arrive at an approximation o f the number o f annual cases o f per
child. The prevalence rate i s not multipliedby 26 two-week periods (Le. 52/2), but multipliedby
52/2.5 for the following reason: The average duration o f diarrheal illness i s assumed to be 3-4
days. This implies that the two-week prevalence captures a quarter o f the diarrheal prevalence in
the week prior to and a quarter inthe week after the two-week prevalence period.

Since MICS does not (nor does any other household survey inTajikistan) provide information on
diarrheal illness in the population above 5 years o f age, estimations from other countries were
used. The study therefore used data on cases o f diarrheal illness for several years based on
reported information from health care facilities (Larsen, 2004a,b).                 This database provides an
indication o f the annual incidence o f diarrhea per child relative to annual incidence for the rest o f
the population. An analysis o f the database suggests that diarrheal incidence in the population
above 5 years o f age is 1/5tho f incidence in children under 5 years. It should be noted however
that the database contains information on cases o f diarrhea treated at health facilities. Ingeneral,
the %age o f cases o f diarrhea that are treated at health facilities i s higher among young children
than older children and adults.

Sometimes diarrheal illness requires hospitalization. However, there are no available centralized
records in Tajikistan that provide data on the annual number o f diarrheal hospitalizations. So the
number o f hospital admissions due to diarrhea was estimated using information on
hospitalizationrates provided inBaschieri and Falkingham (2007). Hospitalization rate o f 0.2 per
cent was applied to all cases o f diarrhea estimated from the MICS 2000 to equal the figure on
total number o f hospitalizations due to intestinal diseases.

Table A.3.11 also has DALYs per cases o f diarrheal illness, which are used to estimate the
number of DALYs lost because of inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene.                            The
disability weight for diarrheal morbidity i s 0.119 for children under-5 and 0.086 for the rest o f
the population, and the duration o f illness is assumedto be the same (Le., 3-4 days). However,
the DALYsper 100 thousand cases o f diarrheal illness are much higher for the populationover 5
years o f age. This i s because DALY calculations involve age weighting that attaches a low
weight to young children and a higher weight to adults that corresponds to physical and mental
development stages.31 For diarrheal child mortality the number o f DALYs lost is 34. This
reflects an annual discount rate o f 3 % o f life years lost.

Baseline data used for the estimation o f the cost o f morbidity are presentedin Table A.3.12. %
o f diarrheal cases in the age group older than 5 years treated at medical facilities i s estimated
from % o f treated cases among children (MICS 2000) and international experience (Larsen
2004a,b).      Cost o f medical services reflects the cost o f estimated private health care (WHO-
CHOICE). This i s a better indication o f the economic cost o f health services than public services
that are subsidized in Tajikistan.

The value o f time lost for adults is imputed based on urban and rural wages. The analysis used
75 % o f the urban and rural wages in Tajikistan as the imputed value for both income earning
and non-income earning adults. It may be noted here that the non-income earning adults are
engaged ina household function that has value and they also have an opportunity to join the paid
labor force.32

4. Indoor Air Pollution

There are two main steps inquantifying the health effects ofindoor air pollution. The first step is
to estimate the number o f people or households exposed to pollution from solid fuels, and
measure the extent o f pollution, or concentration. The second step i s to quantify the health
impacts from the exposure based on epidemiological assessments. Once the health impacts are
quantified, the value o f this damage can be estimated.

We have used the MICS 2005 data on household use o f fuels for cooking.                          The data indicate
that around 8 % o f urban and 49 % o f rural households usedfuel wood for cooking in2005.

Desai et a1 (2004) provides a review o f research studies around the world that have assessed the
magnitude o f health effects o f indoor air pollution from solid fuels. The odds ratios for ARI and
COPD are presentedin Table 5.1. The odds ratios representthe risk o f illness for those who are
exposed to indoor air pollution compared to the risk for those who are not exposed. The exact
odds ratio depends on several factors such as concentration level o f pollution in the indoor
environment and the amount o f time individuals are exposed to the pollution. A range o f "low"
to "high" ratios is therefore presented inTable 5.1 that reflects the review by Desai et a1(2004).

Studies around the world have also found linkages betweenindoor air pollution from traditional
fuels and increased prevalence o f tuberculosis and asthma. It i s also likely that indoor air
pollution from such fuels can cause an increase in ischemic heart disease and other
cardiopulmonary disorders. As discussed inthe section on urban air pollution, Pope et a1 (2002)
and others have found that the largest effect o f urban fine particulate pollution on mortality i s for
the cardiopulmonary disease group. As indoor smoke from traditional fuels is high in fine
particulates, the effect on these diseases might be substantial. More research i s however required
inorder to draw a definite conclusionabout the linkage and magnitude o feffect.

The odds ratios inTable A.3.13 have inthis report been applied to young children under the age
o f five years (for ARI) and adult females (for ARI and COPD) to estimate the increase in
mortality and morbidity associated with indoor air pollution.33 It i s these population groups who
suffer the most from indoor air pollution. This i s because they spend much more o f their time at
home, and/or more time cooking than older children and adult males.


                                                                             Odds Ratios (OR:
                                                                                  "Low"         "High"

To estimate the health effects o f indoor air pollution from the odds ratios in Table A.3.13,
baseline data for ARI and COPD need to be established. These data are presented in Table

33 Although Desai et a1 (2004) present odd ratios for lung cancer, this effect o f pollution i s not estimated in this
report. This is becausethe incidenceof lungcancer among ruralwomen is generally very low. The number of cases
in ruralTajikistan associated with indoor air pollution is therefore likely to be minimal.

  A.3.14, along with unit figures for disability adjusted life years (DALYs) lost to illness and
  mortality. Data on COPD mortality and especially incidence o f morbidity, according to
  international disease classifications, are not readily available for Tajikistan. Regional estimates
  from WHO (2001) and Shibuya et a1 (2001) for the Euro B region are therefore used.34

  The national average o f two-week prevalence rate of ARI in children under 5 years from the
  MICS 2005 was used to estimate total annual cases of ARI in children under-5. The procedure
  applied i s to multiply the two-week prevalence rate by 52/3 to arrive at an approximation o f the
  annual cases o f ARI per child3'.

  The MICS does not (nor does any other household survey in Tajikistan) provide information on
  ARI inadults. So international evidence on annual incidence of ARI per child relative to annual
  incidence per adult (Larson, 2004a,b) was used. An analysis o f the database suggests that ARI
  incidence in population over 5 years i s about 1/5'h o f the incidence in children less than 5 years
  o f age. ARI mortality in children under 5 years i s 17-20 % o f total estimated child mortality
  (Health Ministry, UNICEF). Table 5.2 also presents DALY per cases o f ARI and COPD, which
  are used to estimate the number o f DALYs lost because of indoor air pollution. The disability
  weight for ARI morbidity is the same for children and adults (0.28), and the duration o f illness is
  also assumed to be the same (7 days). The DALYs per 100 thousand cases o f ARI i s however
 much higher for adults. This i s because DALY calculations involve age weighting that attaches
 a low weight to young children, and a higher weight to adults, that corresponds to physical and
  mental development stages.36 For ARI child mortality the number o f DALYs lost is 34. This
  reflects an annual discount rate o f 3 % o f life years lost.

COPD morbidity and mortality.

EstimatedHealthImpacts

Annual new cases of ARI and COPD morbidity and mortality (Di) from fuel wood smoke were
estimatedfrom the following equation:



where DiBis baseline cases of illness or mortality, i(estimated from the baseline data in Table
5.3), and PAR is given by:

PAR =PP*(OR-1)/(PP*(OR-1)+1)                        (2)

where PP is the %age of populationexposedto fuel wood smoke (8 % ofurbanand 49 % ofrural
householdsaccordingto MICS 2006), and OR i s the odds ratios (or relative risk ratios) presented
inTable 5.1.

Treatment costs are estimatedbased on costs of healthcare services offered by the private sector
as these are likely to better reflect the true economic costs. % of ARI cases in the age group
older than 5 years treated at medical facilities is estimated from % of treated cases among
children (MICS 2005) and the ratio of treated cases among children under-5 to treated cases
amongthe populationabove 5 years of age. The latter ratio is from the international estimations
discussedinthe BaselineHealthData section.

The time lost inthe case of adults is valued at 75 % of average hourly wages. There is very little
informationabout the frequency of doctor visits, emergencyvisits and hospitalizationfor COPD
patients inthe developingcountries. Since such data are not available for Tajikistan, data derived
from Schulmanet a1(2001) and Niedermanet a1 (1999) on United States and Europe are used in
this study. Estimated lost workdays per year is based on frequency of estimated medical
treatment, an additional 7 days for each hospitalization and one extra day for each doctor and
emergencyvisit. These days are added to reflecttime neededfor recovery from illness.

To estimate the cost of a new case of COPD, the medical cost and value of time losses are
discounted over 20 year duration of illness. An annual real increase of 2 % in medicalcost and

 value of time has been applied to reflect an average expected increase in annual labor
 productivity and real wages. The costs are then discounted at 3 % per year, a rate commonly
 usedby WHO for health effects.

 Baseline data used to estimate the cost of morbidity are presented in Table A.3.15. The
 treatment costs are based on costs of private sector health care services, as these are likely to
 better reflect economic cost. Cost of mortality is discussedbellow. Inorder to estimate the % of
 ARI cases inthe age group older than 5 years, treated at medical facilities, the % of treated cases
 among children obtained from MICS, 2005 are combined with international experience. The
 time lost due to illness in the case of adults i s valued at 75 % of average of hourly wage for
 urban and rural workers. The rationale for such valuation of time is discussed in the previous
 sections.

6. Valuation of MortaliQ

Two distinct methods o f valuation o f mortality are commonly used to estimate the social cost o f
premature death: the Human Capital Approach (HCA) and the Value o f Statistical Life (VSL).
Although both the approaches are being used, the VSL approach i s more common in the last
couple o f decades. Inthis report, the H C A has been applied as a lower bound and VSL approach
as the higher bound in estimating the cost o f adult mortality. However in the case o f child
mortality, the H C A has beenused.

HumanCapitalApproach

The HCA is based on the economic contribution o f an individual to society over the lifetime o f
the individual and death results inan economic loss that is approximated by the loss of all future
income o f the individual. Future income i s discounted to reflect its value at the time o f death.
The discount rate commonly applied is the rate o f time preference. Thus the social cost o f
mortality, according to the HCA, i s the discounted future income o f an individual at the time o f
death. Ifthe risk o f death, or mortality risk, i s evenly distributed across income groups, average
expected future income i s applied to calculate the social cost o f death. Mathematically, the
present value o f fiiture income is expressed as follows:


PV, (I)=   cI,(1
            r=n     +g)'  /(1+r)l                      (1)
            i=k



where PVo (I)s present value of future income (I) year 0 (year o f death), g is annual growth
                 i                                     in
inreal income, and r is the discount rate (rate of time preference). As can be seen from (l),    the
equation allows for income to start from year k, and ending inyear n. Inthe case o f children, we
may have i (20, 65}, assuming the lifetime income on average starts at age 20 and ends at
               E
retirement at age 65. An annual growth of real income and the discount rate used inthis study
are 2 % and 3 % respectively.

Several important issues are often raised regarding the HCA. The first issue is regarding the
application o f this valuation approach to individuals who do not participate in the economic
activities, Le., to individuals, such as the elderly, family members taking care o f the home, and
children who do not earn an income. One may think o f an extension o f the H C A that recognizes
the value o f non-paid household work at the same rate as the average income earner, or at a rate
equal to the cost o f hiring a household helper. Inthis case, the H C A can be applied to the death
o f non-income earners and children (whether or not children will become income earners or take
care o f the home duringtheir adult life). Inthe case o f the elderly, the H C A would not assign an
economic value to old individuals that have either retired from the workforce or do not make
significant contributions to household work. This obviously i s a serious shortcoming o f the
HCA approach.

The second issue regarding the HCA is that the social cost ofmortality is limitedto the economic
contribution o f an individual or value o f household work ifthe individual takes care o f the home.
Alternative approaches to the valuation o f mortality, or social cost o f mortality, have therefore
been developed and increasingly been applied in the past couple o f decades. These approaches

employ a concept or measure called VSL, which nowadays is muchmore widely used in public
policy thanthe HCA approach.

The estimated cost of mortality in Tajikistan based on HCA, using Eq. 1 is presented in Table
A.3.16. Average annualincome i s approximatedby GDP per capita, at about 1050 TJS per year.

Value of StatisticalLife

While the HCA involves valuation of the death of an individual, VSL is based on valuation of
mortality risk. Everyone in society is constantly facing a certain risk of dying. Examples of
such risks are occupational fatality risk, risk of traffic accident fatality, and environmental
mortality risks. It has been observed that individuals adjust their behavior and decisions in
relation to such risks. For instance, individuals demand a higher wage (a wage premium) for a
job that involves a higher than average occupational risk of fatal accident, individuals may
purchase safety equipment to reduce the risk of death, and/or individuals and families may be
willing to pay a premium or higher rent for properties (land and buildings) ina cleaner and less
pollutedneighborhoodor city.

Hence by observing individuals' choices and willingness to pay for reducing mortality risk (or
minimum amounts that individuals require to accept a higher mortality risk), it is possible to
measure or estimate the value to society of reducingmortalityrisk, or, equivalently, measure the
social cost of a particular mortality risk. For instance, it may be observed that a certain health
hazard has a mortality risk of 1/10,000. This means that one individual dies every year (on
average) for every 10,000 individuals because of that particularhealthhazard. Ifeach individual
on average is willing to pay 10TJS per year for eliminatingthis mortalityrisk, then every 10,000
individuals are collectively willing to pay 100 thousand TJS per year for eliminating the
mortality risk. This is the VSL for eliminating the mortality risk. Mathematically it can be
expressed as:



where WTPAve is the average willingness-to-pay (TJS per year) per individual for reducing the
mortality risk of magnitude R. In the illustration above, R=1/10.000 (or R=O.OOOl)           and
WTPAve= 10 TJS. Thus, if 10 individualsdie each year from the healthrisk illustratedabove, the
cost to society i s 10* VSL = 10*100 thousandTJS = 1 million TJS.

                                               136

The main two approaches to estimate the VSL are revealed preference and stated preference
analyzes. Most of the studies that use revealed preferences are hedonic wage studies, which
estimate labor market wage differentials associated with differences in occupational mortality
risk. The stated preference studies use Contingent Valuation Methods (CVM), which estimates
Willingness-To-Pay(WTP) of individualsfor mortalityrisk reduction.

Mrozek and Taylor (2002) provide a meta-analysisof VSL estimates from labor market studies
from around the world. They identify a "best-practice" sample and control for industry
characteristics other than occupational mortality risk that also affects inter-industry wage
differentials. The study concludes that a lower estimate for VSL of USD 2 million can be
reasonably inferred from labor market studies when "best-practice" assumptions are used. It
should however be noted that the VSL range inferred by Mrozek and Taylor (2002) is
substantially lower than average VSL estimated in some other meta-analyses where the mean
VSL is as high as US $6 million. As a higher bound for VSL a mean estimate of VSL meta
analysis from of USD 5.4 million was applied. The latest meta analysis of VSL estimates is by
Kochi et a1 (2006) utilizing the empirical Bayes pooling method to combine and compare
estimates ofthe VSL data from 40 selectedstudiespublishedbetween 1974 and 2002, containing
197 VSL estimates.

BenefitTransfer

There are no studies on VSL in Tajikistan. The overwhelming majority of VSL studies have
been conducted in countries with substantially higher income level than in Tajikistan. Hence
VSL estimates from these countries haveto be adjustedto suit the conditions inTajikistan. One
commonly used approach in benefit transfer is to use income elasticities.            39Viscusi and Aldi
(2002) estimate an income elasticity of VSL inthe range of 0.5-0.6 from a large sample of VSL
studies. The range in income elasticity is however influenced by three unusually high estimates
o f VSL from labor market data from one state inIndia. Leaving out these three studies provides
an incomeelasticity of about 0.80.

However, the most appropriate income elasticity to use for low-income countries, such as
Tajikistan, remains uncertain as the income level in Tajikistan falls far outside the range of
income inthe sample of countries from which the income elasticities of VSL is estimated in the
empirical literature. A prudent approachmight be to apply an elasticity of 1.O in order to reduce
the risk of overstatingthe cost of mortalityinTajikistan.

Table A.3.17 presents the VSL for Tajikistan from benefit transfer based on the range of VSL
reported by Mrozek and Taylor (2002) as the lower bound, and Kochi et a1 (2006) as the upper
bound, and an incomeelasticity of 1.O.        These figures are substantiallyhigher than the ones from
the HCA, especially for adult mortality due to urban air pollution and indoor air pollution. A
comparisonis presentedinTable A.3.18.

Annex 4, Institutionaldesign of environmentalmanagementsystem in
Tajikistan

The environment protection law stipulates several types o f controls and institutions to implement
the environmental provisions at the state, ministerial, business and community levels. The state
level control i s exercised by the State Control Service on Nature use and Protection in the
Ministry of Agriculture and Environment Protection and by the Sanitary Inspection Service of
the Ministry of Health and Inspectionon MiningSafety. At the ministerial level enforcement is
done by different line ministries and the state agencies under them with no effective coordination
across the line ministries. In addition to the state level and ministerial level controls there i s a
businesslevel control, which impliesthat every business has to observe the environmental law.

Pursuant to Article 12 o f the Tajik Constitution "On the Government o f Republic o f Tajikistan"
and Decree of the President dated November 30, 2006 the then agency responsible for
environmental affairs, State Committee on Environment Protection and Forestry (SCEPF) was
dismissed and its functions were assigned to the Ministry of Agriculture and Nature Protection.
The government through its decree on December 28, 2006 created the State Control Service of
Natural Resources and Environmental Protection (SCSNREP) under the Ministry o f Agriculture
and Nature Protection (MANP)40. The newly reconstituted MANP has the Department o f Nature
Use and Protection, chaired by a Deputy Minister. The different agencies under the DNUP are
SCSNREP, Agency on Hydrometeorology and Anti-hail service, Agency on Forestry and
Hunting, Tajik Scientific Research Institute of Nature Use and Forestry, Scientific-Research
Center on Water Resources Protection, Scientific-Research Laboratory on Nature Protection,
State Department on specially protected areas "Tajik National Park", Scientific-Production
Center "Tabiat" and the State Enterprise, "Saidu Sayokhat".                   The organizational setup o f the
environment block in the MANP i s presented in Chart 1.                       The organizational chart o f the
SCSNREP i s presented inChart 2

The role of the national government is to approve regulations of the ministries and state
committees, define their structures and to be responsible for their coordination and international
cooperation for enforcement o f environmental laws. In order to achieve these, the government i s
expected to undertake the following specific functions: (1) formulate unified state policy on the
use o f natural resources, environment protection and environmental safety, (2) adopt measures to
provide rights to residents for a healthy environment and environmental safety, (3) coordinate
activities o f the state environmental protection agencies, state and intergovernmental
environmental programs aimed at prevention o f natural and manmade disasters and their
mitigation, and (4) implement control over nature protectionand use o f natural resources.




40EarlierMinistry of Agriculturewas limited in its functions in environment protection.The most important
functions were import and export control,control o f agriproductsproduction, processingand stocking, o f wastes and
equipment to manage final products and environmental safety in general. The Ministry was also responsible for
quarantine of plants and animals, coordinationof studies in land use, applicationo f chemical fertilizers.The
Ministry had no right to enforce administrative sanctions for violations of environment protectionlaw as they were
applied by the specialized inspectorateand the Ministry could only refer to that inspectorate.. As regards
quarantine,the Ministry had had its own State Inspection service to enforce quarantine of plants and State Veterinary
Inspection the veterinary quarantine requirements

The mission of the State Control Service o f Natural Resources and Environment Protection
(SCSNREP) Agency is environmental protection and sustainable use o f natural resources and to
ensure effective interdepartmental coordination. The SCSNREP i s entrusted with the following
functions :

        define national policies for environmental protection, research on sustainable use o f
        natural resources, mitigation o f effects o f global climate change;
       prepare and publishinformation bulletins and bi-annual reports on environment;
        draft environmental laws and standards and develop a framework for sustainable use o f
        natural resources;
        issue individual permits for the use o f specific types o f resources and overseeing their
        compliance and revocation incase o f violations;
        develop a system o f economic instruments to stimulate sustainable use o f natural
       resources;
        establish limits on the use o f certaintypes of strategic natural resources;
       manage the special (off-the-budget) ecological fund.

The Service is entitled to: (1) obtain required environmental information from other
governmental services; (2) request reports related to the environment from other governmental
agencies and issue mandatory decrees; (3) suspend or limit economic activities which violates
environmental law; (4) prohibit import or transit o f hazardous cargo in case o f violations o f
environmental law; (5)       prohibit projects whose implementation violates environmental
requirements.

The SCSNREP has its own laboratory and expertise needed to conduct the following four
specialized inspections:

   0    State Water Inspectionin regard to the water resources inthe country;
   0    State Inspection o f Animals and Plants to ensure safe use and protection o f plants and
       animals;
        State Inspection o f Land and Wastes so as to facilitate sustainable use o f lands and
       optimal waste management practices;).
   0   State Air Inspectionfor the implementation o f ambient air quality standards;

The Inspectionofficers o fthe SCSNREP have rightto:

   0   access any business or other facility with the purpose o f inspection o f relevant
       documents, performance o f water treatment facility and controlling devices;
       issue mandatory instructions to mitigate ecological consequences;
   0   enforce administrative sanctions and request environment authorities to initiate criminal
       cases against violators, and sue them incivil courts for damage done;
   0   suspend or terminate business operations hazardous to environment or public health.

The inspection officers can operate independently but are limited by their powers as defined by
law (Administrative Code, Environment protection law).
