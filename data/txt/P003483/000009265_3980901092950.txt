INTEGRATED REGIONAL IHEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
CREDIT 2009-CHA
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Integrated Regional Health
Development Project in China, for which Credit 2009-CHA in the amount of SDR 39.4 million
(US$52 million equivalent) was approved on September 14, 1989 and made effective on January
19, 1990. The credit was closed on December 31, 1997. It was fully disbursed; the last
disbursement took place on June 5, 1998.
The ICR was prepared by Janet Hohnen (Task Manager) in the Population, Health and
Nutrition Sector Unit of the East Asia and Pacific Region, based on a draft prepared by
consultant David Dunlop. It was reviewed by Maria Macdonald (Principal Population Specialist)
on behalf of Maureen Law, Sector Manager EASHN, and by Yukon Huang, Country Director,
China. The Borrower's contribution is inc]uded as Annex A. to the report.
Preparation of this ICR was initiated during discussions between the Bank and the
Ministry of Health in December 1996. A Project Completion Workshop was held in Beijing in
April 1998; a summary of the workshop is in Annex C. The ICR is based on materials in the
project file, including extensive summary and analysis prepared by the Borrower and the project
teams, and comments by members of Bank task teams.

IMPLEMENTATI0N COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
INTEGRATED REGIONAL HEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
CREDIT 2009-CHA
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    The Integrated Regional Health Development Project was the World Bank's third health
sector project in China. It was identified and prepared at a time of increasing awareness of
changes in the disease pattern and age structure of China's population. During this period of
very rapid economic growth, investment in health facilities and technology was rising rapidly in
an uncontrolled manner and at the same time funding of essential public health and rural services
was declining. There were coexistent wastage and shortage of health resources and growing
disparities in access to services and in health status. The Bank's sector study, China: Long Term
Issues and Options in the Health Transition (1992), provided compelling evidence and analysis
of these trends which became the rationale for this project and greatly influenced the project
design and the strong support for the project at all levels of government.
2.    The project was identified in May 1986 and approved by the Board on May 2, 1989. The
credit of US$52 million equivalent becarne effective on January 19, 1990. It was supplemented
by a technical assistance grant of US$700,000 from the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP).
Project Objectives
3.    The main objective of the project was to experiment with new ways to improve capability
for planning and delivery of health services by establishing three health regions, each comprising
a medium sized city and its associated suburban and rural areas. The project would assist the
Government by establishing policy criteria and systems for financing investment in the regions
and associated investment in the provincial capitals.
4.    To accomplish this broad objective, the project included nine components for the regional
and provincial levels: (a) health planning, management and reform; (b) disease prevention and
surveillance; (c) health education; (d) maternal and child health services; (e) emergency services;
(f) hospital services; (g) rehabilitation services; (h) medical education and training; and (i)
equipment management and maintenance. The national level component would strengthen



iii
institutional capacity of the Ministry of Health (MOH) in project management and technical
support and assist national policy development.
Implementation and Results
5.    The central project objective of testing a new approach and new methods for health
planning and resource allocation was achieved beyond expectations. Not only has regional
health planning (RHP) been successfully implemented and institutionalized in the three project
areas, but the experience has been widely disseminated to other cities and provinces in China and
RHP has been adopted by the State Development and Planning Commission and the State
Council as a key strategy for health sector development. RHP has also become the mandatory
basis for urban health finance reform. The project also made highly satisfactory progress on
many technical and programmatic initiatives in the components for specific health services.
6.    After a slow start in project implementation related to delayed compliance with financing
agreements, fluctuating economic conditions, constraints on the funding of central level activities
and lack of experience with Bank requirements and procedures, implementation was fully
satisfactory in all components and all project areas. Legal covenants were all met and the credit
was fully disbursed. Major factors in this successful implementation were the limited geographic
scope of the project, clear policy guidelines for each component, stability of project leadership
from identification to project closing, continuous active engagement of government leaders,
regularity and continuity of Bank supervision, and the effective strategy of policy development
adopted by MOH on the basis of the project's results.
7.    The process of annual progress review and approval of plans and budgets allowed
flexibility to adjust project activities according to experience. A two year extension of the project
period consolidated the project's achievements, increased the sustainability of project impact and
greatly assisted the successful adoption of RHP as a national health strategy.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
8.    With wide dissemination of RHP and its inclusion as a strategy of national health policy,
the impact of the central experiment of the project is highly likely to be sustained. The RHP
structure and systems introduced in the three project regions have been fully incorporated into
the health bureaus, and project provinces have made commitments to continue the full range of
activities initiated under the project. The main challenge for full realization of RHP is to include
health facilities operated by state owned enterprises and the growing private sector in the
planning process. The main risk to sustainability will be availability of recurrent funding for
essential public health functions and to ensure access for the poor. With the growing capacity to
use local information to monitor health expenditures and recent policies protecting the share of
government budgets allocated to health, prospects in this regard are hopeful, but not certain.
9.    The project has influenced the design of subsequent health sector projects in China,
particularly the Basic Health Services Project (Health VIII), which adapted the RHP approach for



iv
poor rural counties, and will incorporate clear policy guidelines, a strong monitoring framework
and the annual review and planning mechanism for adjusting project implementation.
10.   The project is an early and successful example of a lending operation with the central
objective of assisting health sector reform. Such operations have since become an important
element of the Bank's health sector strategy. This project experience is therefore relevant for
other countries pursuing health sector reform. From this project the following lessons were
learned:
Project Design
(a)    Successful project design depends on adequate sector analysis. In this project,
timely presentation of relevant, high quality sector work persuaded key government
officials of the importance and feasibility of the project's basic concept and strategy.
(b)    Complex, experimental projects can be successfully implemented in a limited
geographic area, given sufficient allocation to engage and build capacity for higher level
technical and management support. This is an alternative scenario to projects with a
narrow content focus but wide geogyraphic coverage.
(c)   It is feasible, with good design, leadership mobilization and local ownership, to
use a project to drive policy reform. This is an alternative scenario to the stress on
adequate policy environment as a pre-requisite for project success. In an uncertain or
evolving policy environment, project investments can provide a strong incentive for
important reform decisions which would otherwise be very difficult.
Project Management and Implementation
(d)   Flexibility in resource allocation and activity scheduling, associated with clear
policy guidelines and a rigorous annual review, are key strategies for successful sector
improvement projects, and contribute to sustainable management capacity.
(e)    Continuity of personnel allows for greater management flexibility as parties
increase trust in each others' capacity.
(f)    Dialogue should begin early concerning continuity and sustainability issues, so
that annual plans can be adjusted to maximize chances of long term impact.
(g)   The Bank's role in supervision should change with growing borrower experience
and capacity, moving from hands-on, detailed demonstration of supervision to back up
and support to the borrower, and assistance with dialogue on policy and sustainability;
but supervision frequency should not be reduced.



v
(h)   Decentralization of the special account facility, financial information and other
progress data in the project areas can streamline both implementation and monitoring and
build management capacity.
(i)    The need for an extension of the project implementation period, where
development objectives remain valid, should not be interpreted as a deficiency of either
project design or implementation. It is an opportunity for consolidation of achievement
and dissemination of experience. In this project, the two year extension was a critical
factor in the policy impact as well as technical progress.
Health Development
(j)    The Government's high level commitment to health policy reform  and its
attention to the project experience enabled the project to contribute to national policy and
strategy for decentralizing health planning and improving resource allocation.
(k)   To contribute successfully to policy development, all levels of government should
have a stake in the process of testing and analyzing the results of project initiatives.
Involvement of influential professional groups assists this process, providing an
alternative and supplement to Govermment for discussion and dissemination of project
results and policy implications.



CHINA
INTEGRATED REGIONAL HEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
CREDIT 2009-CHA
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
1.    The objective of the project was to experiment with new ways to improve the capability
for planning and delivery of health services for a defined population by establishing three health
regions (one in each of three provinces), each comprising a medium sized city and its associated
suburban and rural areas. The project would assist the Government by establishing policy criteria
and systems for financing investments in the regions and supporting investment in the provincial
capitals.
2.    To accomplish this broad objective, the project included nine components for the regional
and provincial levels: (a) health planning, management and reform; (b) disease prevention and
surveillance; (c) health education; (d) maternal and child health (MCH) services; (e) emergency
services; (f) hospital services; (g) rehabilitation services; (h) medical education and training; and
(i) equipment management and maintenance. Each component was designed to test ways of
improving service delivery and management at the regional level and below; most components
included supporting activities at provincial level (see Tables 6a and 6b for the project budget and
costs by component). There was a national level component to strengthen the capacity of MOH
to guide, assess and disseminate the project experience and to address related national policy
issues. The project would provide experience to MOH and the provinces in using policy
guidance, rather than direct budgetary control, to influence health sector development at regional
level.
3.    The three regions selected were Jinhua in Zhejiang Province, Baoji in Shaanxi Province
and Jiujiang in Jiangxi Province. The regions were of comparable population size (3-4 million)
but with different levels and patterns of economic activity. They were representative of over 200
medium sized cities or prefectures in which a large proportion of China's population live. The
region, so defined, comes under the jurisdiction of one local government, with the advantages of
being small enough to understand and monitor the full range of health and program problems
while large enough to make meaningful adjustments in resource allocation. The administrative
linkage of rural hinterland with urban resources also made it feasible to address the rural-urban
imbalance in access and service quality. Thus, if found to be effective, a "regional" health
development strategy might provide a springboard for achieving in a single program many of the
national government's policy objectives. During project preparation a health plan was agreed for
each region and a policy guideline was prepared for each component. Project investments were
designed to assist the regions to implement their overall plans, in accordance with the guidelines,



2
through an annual review and planning exercise, which involved the use of a detailed set of
monitoring indicators.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
4.    The main project objective of testing a new approach and new tools for health planning
and resource allocation was achieved beyond expectations. Not only has regional health
planning (RHP) been successfully implemented and institutionalized in the three project areas,
but the experience has been widely disseminated to other cities and provinces and RHP has been
adopted as national policy by the State Development and Planning Commission (SDPC) and the
State Council.
5.    The project also made good progress on technical and programmatic initiatives in the
other specific components, in which the regions and MOH introduced and tested a large range of
new ideas and conducted small studies. Many of these initiatives were successful within the
project period. Others were not, especially those beginning from a low level of capacity or
awareness, or in unfavorable financial circumstances; however, valuable lessons were learned
from this experience. Overall each component met its objectives with respect to rationalizing
and upgrading of physical facilities, human resource development, improved networking and
efficiency of urban services and enhanced linkages between levels for supervision and referral.
Annex A provides the Borrower's summary of achievements under each component and Tables
Sa and 5b list the main studies undertaken and the guidelines and manuals produced under each
component.
6.    Highlights of achievements in each component include:
Component A: Full demonstration of the value, feasibility and procedures of regional
planning for health resource allocation; establishment of an information management and
processing capability to support local decision making and monitoring of progress.
Control of expansion of high level health facilities. Pioneered regular total health
expenditure surveys.
Component B: A strengthened, integrated approach to disease control, with enhanced
surveillance and analytic capability, incorporating both infectious and non-communicable
disease (NCD). Renewed focus and funding for infectious disease control programs.
Component C: Improved professional capacity in health education; a planning process to
link health education to the key health problems and control initiatives; conduct of a large
intervention study in smoking prevention in school students which was presented at the
1997 World Conference on Tobacco and Health.
Component D: Capability to survey and monitor maternal and child health in the region.
Demonstrated reductions in infant and maternal deaths, increased prenatal care and



3
institutional delivery, and improvements in quality of care and health worker skills with
emphasis on rural counties.
Component E: Set up pre-hospital and hospital emergency service networks. Upgraded
blood transfusion services.
Component F: Controlled expansion in urban hospital beds, through relocation and
amalgamation of facilities. Controlled purchase and operation of high level equipment
with improved access through hospital networks. Upgraded rural township and county
hospitals. Enhanced national capability in hospital design and construction. Upgraded
hospital management capacity; reduced hospital infection rates; expanded hospital roles
into community outreach, home care and prevention.
Component G: Introduced modem concepts of physical rehabilitation and established
rehabilitation units staffed by qujalified professionals as a part of hospital services.
Piloted community based rehabilitation. Broadened access to services and support for the
mentally ill and their families.
Component H: Upgraded health training facilities. Accelerated curriculum reform, with
wider choice of subjects; introcluced community placements and flexible learning
programs. Commenced general practitioner training.
Component I:  Established professional capacity and networks for procurement,
evaluation, management, repair and maintenance of hospital equipment.
C. IMPLEMENTATION RECORI) AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
7.    All project components were ful].y implemented in all project areas. The pace and
success of implementation varied among regions and components, but overall the expectations of
all parties were met and in many areas were exceeded. This successful implementation can be
attributed to the foresight and courage of MOH, provincial and regional officials in undertaking
the project; the clear guidelines prepared for each component; capable and continuous support of
the project areas by the higher levels; and timely identification and addressing of problems. The
main factors affecting implementation are discussed below.
8.    Changes in the Economic Environment. The project's start coincided with a two year
period of relatively low economic growth in China, in 1989 and 1990, when real GDP/capita
grew at about 2.5% rather than about 10°/, in the years before and after this period. Following
this there was a period of high inflation, leading to higher prices, especially for construction
materials. All these factors affected the availability of counterpart funds.
9.    Funding Arrangements. The Bank, the Government of China, and the project provinces
signed agreements before project effectiveness on use of the IDA credit and the bearing of the
foreign exchange risk. However, problems with implementing these agreements persisted until



4
November 1992, and contributed to early implementation delay, especially in Jiangxi province '/.
The onlending arrangements, with all repayment responsibility taken by the provinces and
regions, also constrained central level project management and reduced the opportunities for
national level capacity building. These constraints were relieved to some extent by a technical
assistance grant of US$700,000 from UNDP and by a currency devaluation which provided
discretionary local funds, some of which were made available to the central level.
10.   Table 6(c) shows that expenditure of Bank funds was greater than expected, with a lower
counterpart contribution than projected, differences attributable to the currency devaluation. Two
of the regions used these extra funds to improve investment in rural hospitals, which they
considered had been given inadequate attention in the original project design.
11.   Project Supervision and Monitoring. The supervision plan of two joint Bank-MOH
missions each year, with at least one field visit and an annual review of progress and approval of
plans, was carried out throughout the implementation period. In the early years, the detailed
review was conducted by Bank team members, with the MOH team in a supplementary role.
Following the mid-term review (MTR) in 1993, MOH took prime responsibility for review of
progress and plans, and presented their findings and recommendations to the Bank team. This
change helped to strengthen the management and monitoring capabilities of both national and
provincial staff and made better use of their practical project experience. The Bank's role then
was to back up MOH and help improve technical and managerial capacity of MOH line
departments and the provincial and regional health bureaus.
12.   Based on the arrangements made at appraisal, the project areas reported regularly
reported on an extensive range of quantitative indicators for the socioeconomic environment and
for each component. Following the MTR, there was a review of the value of these indicators and
their use in management and planning. Proposals were made to include qualitative measures to
monitor the critical steps and processes of the RHP experiment and institutional reforn. These
were not adopted; however, the final project reports of each area include descriptions and
analysis of these processes. Project managers regarded the monitoring system as an integral part
of RHP, and incorporated much of it into the ongoing health information system. Although
some of the indicators were found not to be useful, the experience of collecting the data and
reviewing its usefulness was itself an important part of the RHP experiment.
13.   Extension of the Project Period. The first two years of implementation were slower than
projected in the SAR, partly due to the financial and economic difficulties mentioned above, and
partly to optimistic scheduling in the project design. Additional factors were the lack of
experience of the project provinces and regions with Bank procedures and requirements, and the
The RMB devalued from 3.72 RMB/US$ at the time of the appraisal mission in December 1988, to 5.7.5 RMB/US$ in 1992, or
by nearly 54.5% during this period. By late 1996, the rate was 8.28 RMB/US$. These changes would have had the effect
of greatly increasing the local currency repayments required from the provinces.



5
extra time required to finalize the major hospital mergers, closures and networks which had been
agreed in the regional health plans. The need for an extension of the project implementation
period was foreshadowed during the MTR in May 1993, and in 1995 a two year extension was
approved. This extension compensated for delays in the early stages of the project, provided
added incentive to solve difficult hospital construction issues, allowed consolidation of early
gains in all components, and helped to foster the national evaluation and dissemination of the
RHP, as well as experience in many other initiatives.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
14.    With the wide dissemination of RHP, and its inclusion as a central strategy in the
Decisions of the Central Committee of t.he Chinese Communist Party and the State Council on
Health Reform and Development of January 1997, the impact of the central experiment of the
project in regional health planning and management is most likely to be sustained and will
provide a strong basis for institutional change within the sector in coming years. The three
project provinces have made commitments to continue the full range of activities initiated under
the project, and Zhejiang Province has established an Office of Regional Health Planning within
its Planning Commission.
15.    However, recent improvements in health policy have come after a large decline in public
funding of essential health programs over the last 15 years, especially for prevention and rural
primary health care. Program viability across project areas and components will undoubtedly be
variable 2/. Project components with revenue generating potential, such as health education and
equipment management, may be able to earn income from the equipment and skills acquired
during the project. The latter may be suitable for privatization, entering into contracts with
public facilities. Other important components such as disease surveillance and MCH services
may face financial difficulties unless they maintain a high priority with local governments. The
sustainability of rehabilitation services will depend on the extent to which they are covered by
health insurance. With rapid changes in health manpower needs in China, the future of some
medical training institutions is uncertain, although they are increasingly supported through
private students.
2 World Bank, China: Issues and Options for Health Financing, Report No. 15278. (Washington D.C.: World Bank, August 12,
1996). In two project regions, Jiujiang and Baoj i, estimates of real per capita total and government health expenditures are
available from the project reports for the periods 1989-1995 and 1988-1996, respectively. The two regions show
increases in both indices, but they have very different levels of per capita expenditure rates of increase. For Jiujiang,
government per capita health expenditures are well above 50 RMB throughout the period, and with steady increase
throughout the 1989-95 period, such that government health expenditures per capita doubled. For Baoji, per capita total
and government health expenditures increased for the period as a whole by about 30%, but declined after 1991. The actual
level of government health expenditure in Baoji is estimated to be only 2 RMB per person per year, a level well below that
indicated for Jiujiang.

E. BANK PERFORMANCE
16.   According to senior project staff, the World Bank's sector studies, including The Health
Sector in China, 1984, and China: Long Term Issues and Options in the Health Transition, 1992,
which began during project preparation, provided influential data on key sectoral issues and
policy options for the design of the project. The Bank's team collaborated with the Government
to identify and prepare the project to test RHP and a number of other health sector
improvements. The Bank team developed the policy guidelines for each component which were
fornally published by MOH and became Annex 2 of the project staff appraisal report (SAR).
These guidelines were a constant authoritative reference for project implementation and were
widely cited by project officials as critical to the project's successful implementation.
17.   The Bank maintained its twice-yearly supervision schedule throughout project
implementation, with continuity from a small group of technical consultants on the task team for
much of that period. As described above, the more collaborative approach adopted after the
MTR was appreciated by government staff and improved cooperation between the Bank and the
Government. The Bank fulfilled its responsibilities for the MTR and the project extension in a
timely manner with the cooperation of officials of the project areas, MOH and MOF.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
18.   Overall Borrower performance was highly satisfactory during both project preparation
and implementation. This was largely due to the competence and stability of project directors in
MOH and in the project areas, several of whom were involved in the project for ten years. There
was also a strong commitment to the project by managers in the line departments of MOH, and
key technical institutions, and strong project management by the Foreign Loan Office of MOH.
The establishment of a special account for each project province with the central special account
managed by MOH greatly facilitated the monitoring of expenditures and disbursement progress
by project managers. The fluctuating economic conditions, staff changes in core government
agencies at different levels, and the complexity of the project posed major challenges to the
Borrower, which were generally competently addressed. The project was somewhat constrained
by the limited funding available for central level support, particularly for Component B, Disease
Surveillance and Control. Technical development was also constrained by organizational delays
and bureaucratic difficulties in the processing of foreign travel and training and use of foreign
technical support. These difficulties are found in Bank supported operations in many sectors in
China. Overall the staff of MOH and related technical institutions made full use of available
opportunities to supervise, monitor and support the project, and to analyze and disseminate
project experience. Progress reporting and covenant compliance were fully satisfactory.
19.   A notable aspect of Borrower performance was the way in which the unfolding
experience of the project in RHP was made available to an increasingly broad and influential
audience, both locally and nationally. One instrument for this was the Regional Health
Development Association, formed on the initiative of MOH, which, with some project support,
grew to include over 25 cities, several provinces, and experts from related academic institutions.



7
This network of Government and academic staff also provided leadership in advocacy on RHP to
the State Development and Planning Commission, and the policy analysis required for RHP to be
adopted by the State Council.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
20.   The outcome of the project is highly satisfactory. This assessment is based on the
outstanding achievement of the project's core objective - to test and demonstrate a new approach
to health sector planning and resource allocation, Regional Health Planning. The key outcome of
the project has been the dissemination and institutionalization of RHP, and its inclusion as in the
Decision Paper on Health Development issued by the State Council in January 1997. Two
former project directors are now members of the National Task Force on RHP.
21.   The outcomes of the other components are also considered fully satisfactory. The project
was able to make progress on many technical and programmatic issues involved in these
components. The regions and MOH used the project to test new ideas in each topic area. Table
5. summarizes the main studies, guidelines and manuals completed for each component. Annex
C records the main achievements and rernaining challenges of the project, as discussed at the
Project Completion Workshop in April 1998.
22.   The experience of the project also contributed to improved technical and management
capacity of MOH, nationai experts and the provincial and regional health bureaus.
H. FUTURE OPERATION
23.   The essential infrastructure of the project with respect to RHP has been incorporated into
the regional and provincial Bureaus of Health, including information systems and coordination
arrangements. The Regional Health Committee of each region will continue to function,
possibly with some revisions in membership and terms of references. The policy environment at
all levels is firmly supportive of an impcortant continued role for RHP. Financially, the 1997
Health Policy Decisions would favor increased public funding for essential health programs, but
variations can be expected according to local economic circumstances and the reform
momentum, including the increasing role of the private sector. For the subsector components, all
of which were selected for their growing importance in the China health program, the project's
emphasis on rationalization of facilities and institutions, professional training, networking and
collaboration, and greater use of local information in planning, suggest that most project
initiatives will continue, albeit with further evolution and modification.
24.   The project has influenced the design and implementation of subsequent health
development projects in China. The planning approach and package of subsector components
were adopted for the Basic Health Services Project (Health VIII) which was approved by the
Board in May 1998. The project has also consolidated the model for the role of MOH in



8
implementation of subsequent projects, including central coordination, education, institutional
strengthening and operational research.
25.   Finally, the project has demonstrated the valuable role the Bank can play in assisting the
Government to test or pilot new reforms in a limited area, as part of policy development. In
China, the health sector currently faces several important policy challenges, most notably in
health financing reform and the reform of services and programs to meet the needs of the older
people, people with chronic disease and disability, and the urban poor. Experimental projects
tackling any of these issues in a comprehensive manner could be important areas for further
Bank-Borrower collaboration, either through the new smaller loan packages and/or in association
with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) whose focus is on private health providers.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
26.   This project is an early and successful example of a lending operation with the central
objective of assisting health sector reform. Such operations have since become an important
element of the Bank's health sector strategy in many areas of the world. The project experience
is therefore relevant for other countries pursuing health sector reform. The key lessons from this
project can be grouped into three categories: project design; management; and contribution to
health development.
Project Design
(a)    Successful project design depends on adequate sector analysis. In this project,
timely presentation of relevant, high quality sector work persuaded key government
officials of the importance and feasibility of the project's basic concept and strategy.
(b)   Complex, experimental projects can be successfully implemented in a limited
geographic area, given sufficient allocation to engage and build capacity for higher level
technical and management support. This is an alternative scenario to projects with a
narrow content focus but wide geographic coverage.
(c)   It is feasible, with good design, leadership mobilization and local ownership, to
use a project to drive policy reform. This is an alternative scenario to the stress on
adequate policy environment as a pre-requisite for project success. In an uncertain or
evolving policy environment, project investments can provide a strong incentive for
important reform decisions which would otherwise be very difficult.
Project Management and Implementation
(d)   Flexibility in resource allocation and activity scheduling, associated with clear
policy guidelines and a rigorous annual review, are key strategies for successful sector
improvement projects, and contribute to sustainable management capacity.



9
(e)    Continuity of personnel allows for greater management flexibility as parties
increase trust in each others' capacity.
(f)    Dialogue should begin early on continuity and sustainability issues, so that annual
plans can be adjusted to maximize chances of long term impact.
(g)   The Bank's role in supervision should change with growing borrower experience
and capacity, moving from hands-on, detailed demonstration of supervision to back up
and support to the borrower, ancl assistance with dialogue on policy and sustainability;
but supervision frequency should not be reduced.
(h)    Decentralization of the special account facility, financial information and other
progress data in the project areas can streamline both implementation and monitoring and
build management capacity.
(i)    The need for an extension of project implementation period, where development
objectives remain valid, should not be interpreted as a deficiency of either project design
or implementation.  It is an opportunity for consolidation of achievement and
dissemination of experience. In this project the two year extension was a critical factor in
the policy impact as well as technical progress.
Health Development
()    The Government's high level commitment to health policy reform  and its
attention to the project experience enabled the project to contribute to national policy and
strategy for dccentralizing health planning and resource allocation.
(k)   TIo contributc succcssfLilly to policy developnmenit, all levels of govertinment should
have a stake in the process of testing and analyzing the results of project initiatives.
Involvemient ol influential prolessional groups assists this process, providing an
alternative and supplCmCllt to Governmncnt lor discussioni and dissemination of project
results and policy implications.

BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE ICR
1.     Project Background
China had been facing new challenges in the health sector brought about by changes of disease
pattern and population age structure. On the one hand, the incidence of acute and chronic infectious
diseases, which are the main diseases needing in-patient care, is still high, although there has been a large
decrease in mortality. On the other hand, the risk of non-communicable disease (NCD) is increasing
quickly. Malignant tumor, stroke and coronary arterial diseases are the top-ranked death causes for
elders, and accidental injuries and poisoning for youth. Besides, the trend of aging in China is very rapid
which increases health needs. The disease burden for society is becoming heavier day by day.
At the same time, due to influences caused by the traditional planned economy, Chinese health
sector development could not break out of its pattern of low economic efficiency with tendency to
increase the number and size of health institutions. Health institutions were established according to the
authorities' administrative area (horizontal line) and also sector administration relationships (vertical
line). Thus, in a regional area, health institutions with similar function are duplicated. The health
investment formula of paying much more attention to urban than rural areas, curative rather than
preventive services and hardware rather than software, has not been adjusted fully. Cost-benefit and
efficiency requirements of health services are not satisfied. Shortage and waste of health resources exist
in parallel.
2.     Project Objectives, Design and Organization
The main health aim of the project is to work out an integrated regional health plan on the basis
of health care needs, through coordination between social sectors and all participants of society, and to set
up a health resource plan in a package of 9 components: (a) health management and reform; (b) disease
surveillance and prevention; (c) health edtucation; (d) maternal and child health care; (e) emergency
services; (f) hospital services; (g) rehabilitation; and (i) equipment management and maintenance. This
would improve health investment structure and benefits and health services utilization, and try to
formulate a new pattern of regional health development in order to provide relevant experience for
dissemination all over the country.
Baoji/Shaanxi, Jiujiang/Jiangxi and Jinhua/Zhejiang are selected as trial regions to implement an
integrated regional health plan. Shaanxi, Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces respectively ensured that
provincial health institutions will would carry out supplementary activities to provide staff training and
technical assistance, and conduct field visits and applied research
The project activities of central level are carried out by the line departments of Ministry of Health
(MOH) and central health institutions under MOH. Those institutions are also responsible to review and
ratify the annual project implementation plan and budget of project provinces and prefectures, ensure
project activities are in line with project guidelines and principles, and evaluate project outcomes based
on project objectives and standards. Meanvhile, policy research on regional health planning will be
carried out in the project provinces and prefectures so as to establish effective and cost-effective methods
to plan health resources allocation.

3.    Key Project Activities and Achievements
Provincial and Regional Activities
Component A: Health Management and Reform
(1)    Each of the 3 project prefectures set up a "Health Committee", which makes decisions for the
key issues of the health sector. Each of the 3 project provinces set up a "Project Leading Group," located
at the provincial health bureau.
(2)    Project management offices and consultant groups were set up at both provincial and prefecture
level.  Those offices worked out and implemented project management regulations and working
procedures.
(3)    Medical insurance for employees in municipal areas was reformed. Jiujiang was one of first two
pilot cities for the medical insurance reform across the country. Jinhua was listed in the second group of
pilot cities to carry out the reform.
(4)    Carried out a vast amount of activity to meet the requirements of primary health care in rural
areas.
(5)    Established and improved health information systems. Total health expenditure survey was
conducted continuously from the beginning of project implementation in the three project prefectures.
Many special surveys and routine health data collection were completed.
(6)    The concept of regional health planning (RHP) was publicized. The experiences of the three
project prefectures on RHP were disseminated fully. All the project prefectures and provinces were
active key tnembers of Regional Health Development Association which pushed the RHP forward across
the country.
(7)    A great number of health management staff were trained and updated in many different channels
and forms.
Component B: Disease Surveillance and Prevention
(1)    Established Disease Surveillance Points (DSPs) to monitor target populations yearly on births,
deaths, infectious diseases and non-communicable disease (NCD).
(2)    Strengthened prevention and control of common acute infectious diseases in project areas. For
TB control, treatment with short course intermittent regimens and full supervision were implemented.
Baoji also conducted selenium-deficiency disease control.
(3)    Cornmunity hypertension screening and intervention pilots were conducted in Baoji and Jinhua
cities.
(4)    Strengthened the Epidemic Prevention Station (EPS) through hardware construction and
improved service capability. EPS expanded its service function in the area of NCD control.



23                                   ANNEX A
(5)    The supporting health institutions at provincial level provided staff training, technical assistance,
quality control, etc. in the area of disease surveillance and prevention for the prefectures.
Component C: Health Education
(1)    Fully improved two provincial health education institutes on the civil works, equipment and
professional capacity.
(2)    Set up and perfected health education network in three prefectures.
(3)    Health education norms for other sectors were worked out and put into practice.
(4)    For susceptible population of students, farmers and etc., health education activities on EPI
(immunization) and NCD control were conducted. Those activities included students anti-smoking
survey, 900 millions farmers health behavior program, etc.
(5)    Reinforced anti-smoking movement.  A  series of anti-smoking activities were conducted
including: a students anti-smoking intervention study, smoke-free public areas and non-smoking
institutions, such as health facilities and sclhools.
(6)    Carried out a great amount of health education activities through mass media, including
newspapers, broadcasting and TV program.
Component D: Maternal and Chiild Health Care

Key Achievements
(1)    The distribution and allocation of health resources had been adjusted according to regional health
plan of the prefectures which promotes balanIced health development. Health services establishment had



26                                 ANNEX A
been improved. Comprehensive capability of health services delivery is enhanced. Health condition of
the residents in the areas is promoted.
(2)    Old planning and investment model which focuses on volume and size of health institutions is
changed. New health planning and investment model has been set up which focuses on population health
and health needs.
(3)    A set of management methods on organizational structures, management procedures and
regulations which are comparatively suitable for RHP design and implementation had been set up.
(4)    A series of health services and interventions including pre-hospital medical emergency,
community based medical rehabilitation, general practice, health promotion, etc. which accords with
cost-benefit principles had been introduced into those areas. Some advanced techniques including total
health expenditure, development of health education materials, etc. had been learned.
(5)   In practice, a group of professionals in the area of health management and medicine had been
trained and updated.
(6)    The supporting institutions at central and provincial level not only played a great role in project
implementation in the prefectures, but also enhanced management and services capability themselves.
(7)    Disseminated and distributed Health III experiences and RHP concepts to non-project areas.
Promoted leaders at all levels to pay attention to RHP and finally adopt RHP into national health policy.
4.    Project Sustainability
(1)   In 1997, RHP was confirmed as national health policy in the authorized document of "Central
Committee of CPC and State Council's Decisions on Health Reform and Development", which stated
that: "implementing RHP is an important method for the govemment to adjust and control health
development." Inclusion in this document creates a beneficial environment for project sustainability.
MOH has adopted RHP as one of three priority health reforms.
(2)    All three project prefectures have made decision to keep the "Health Committee" in the long
term, and to adjust and supplement the committee members so as to bring improve its function; this
ensures RHP sustainability in the organizational structure.
(3)    Through the health investment during the project period, original weak components or task areas
such as DSPs, health education, MCH, pre-hospital emergency care, health information management, etc.
have developed well. They have had a better resource base and working background, and increased the
capability of self-development.  In practice, the leaders and health managers have recognized the
importance of those tasks to promote people's health and played a role in the area of increasing
cost-benefit of health investment. They have strengthened management and increased investment.
(4)    All three project provinces have actively carried out the distribution and dissemination of RHP
experiences, expanded pilot spots to implement RHP, adjusted current health resources and trained
managers with RHP theory and method. However, because implementing RHP will involve adjustment
of many other social sectors and irstitutions, there still are a lot difficulties to overcome.



27                                  ANNEX A
(5)    With the development of Chinese economy and society and push of medical insurance reform,
the government will increase health investment for priority health interventions which meet cost-benefit
principles. But for thoroughly improving the poor investment in the area of public health, health
education, community health services, etc., there still are problems.
5.     Project Management Issues
(1)    To pay attention to the preparation before launching the project, define project objectives
accurately, promote awareness of the project significance continuously, work out the project guidelines
and principles timely. Those project guidelines not only absorbed advanced international experience, but
also were suitable for the domestic practicavl situation as a whole.
(2)    To set up management regulation and working procedures to ensure the project operated
normally. In the course of the working out those management regulation, norms and method, the project
managers should pay attention to both the international requirements and the domestic practical situation.
(3)    Carefully deal with project supervision. The supervision could be divided into fixed and routine.
Routine supervision is much more important for the project to solve problems occurred. The supervision
also could be both Bank side and domest]ic. With the gradual improvement of domestic management
capability, the domestic supervision shouldl be increased in place of the Bank side supervision. In order
to evaluate the project effectiveness and ensure approaching project objectives, a set of evaluation
indicators should be set up and data collection should be conducted yearly. Management review of
annual project plan and budget had been carried into execution.
(4)    A steady team of project managers should be shaped, who are interested in the project, with a
sense of responsibility and familiar with the project management procedures. During the ten years from
project preparation to completion, the maijn project managers and staff had not been changed, which
ensures the project management continuity
(5)    Strive for the support and understanding from stakeholders such as governors and concerned
departments of planning, finance, etc. The communication and understanding for the project issues could
be strengthened through project management meetings, workshops and coordination meetings.
6.     Lessons Learned
(1)    Implementing RHP should be government action.  Through strengthening the government
leadership role, the organizational structures, policies and budget for this task should be settled down and
coordination between the sectors should be clone well so as to make the RHP an action of all society.
(2)    RHP is an advanced concept and planning method for health development which is suitable for
the current situation in China. RHP is beneficial to solve the problems of health resources lack and waste
which exist in parallel during Chinese healtlh development. RHP is an effective method to distribute and
allocate health resources rationally and enhance their utilization rate.
(3)    Implementing RHP should aim to meet the objectives of improving people's health and change
the traditional model which focuses on increasing health institutions and staff and expanding health
services volume. While increasing governmental investment, improvement of health services efficiency
and quality should be emphasized, current potential health resources should be developed. Through
carrying out health development strategy inl balance, the weaker health services areas including rural



28                                 ANNEX A
health, preventive medicine, health education and community health services should be strengthened
further and comprehensive health services delivery capability should be improved.
(4)   It's imperative to have supporting institutions at central and provincial level which are convenient
for the prefectures to find support for policy, management and supervision, personnel training and
technical assistance. This is important ensure the implementation of RHP. Meanwhile, the management
and professional capability of MOH, provincial health departments and the central and provincial
institutions concerned had been enhanced greatly.
(5)   Implementing RHP requires continually developing the leaders (stakeholders) and training of
health management staff. A team of health management with a sense of responsibility should be set up
and kept stable. All kinds of supporting policies concerned and management norms, method and
regulation for implementing RHP should be established and perfected gradually.

ICR MISSION'S AIDE MEMOIRE
CHINA: RURAL HEALTH AND PREVENTIVE MEDICINE PROJECT
AND
INTEGRATED REGIONAL HEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    From April 13 to May 2, 1998, a Wiorld Bank consultant, Mr. David Dunlop, visited Beijing to
review progress on two projects, the Rural Health and Preventive Medicine Project (Health II) and the
Integrated Regional Health Development Project (Health III), and to collect information for the
preparation of the Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) of these projects. Work for the Health II
project was coordinated by Mr. Jagadish Upadhyay for the World Bank and by Mr. Yang Hongwei for
the Ministry of Health (MOH), following the final supervision mission of the project's vaccine
production component conducted by Mr. Herbert Boehm, Mr. John Gilmartin (Bank consultants) and
MOH officials in April, 1998. The mission met with officials from the MOH immunization program, the
Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (CAPM) and the Beijing Drug Control Institute.
2.    For the Health III project, the mission's work was coordinated by Dr. Janet Hohnen, for World
Bank, and Dr. Duan Mingyue for MOH, following a consultation by Dr. Vivian Lin with MOH officials
during April. A Health III project review workshop was held in Beijing from April 27-30, when project
directors and staff from all the project areas presented and discussed the main findings of their
comprehensive final project reports. Staff from the Foreign Loan Office and the Department of Finance
and Planning of MOH, from CAPM and the National Health Education Institute also contributed to the
workshop.
3.    The mission wishes to express its appireciation for the cooperation and courtesy received from the
Government in carrying out its work, and to acknowledge the high standard of reports received, and the

PROJECT COMPLETION WORKSHOP
Beijing, April 27-29, 1998
Summary of Discussions
Introduction. The Project Completion Workshop for the Integrated Regional Health
Development Project (Health III) was organized by the Foreign Loan Office of the Ministry of
Health (MOH), for the purpose of a finial joint review of the outcomes, lessons and remaining
challenges of the Project. It was attended by project directors and team members from the three
provinces and regions, staff of MOH and affiliated technical institutions and World Bank
representatives. At the workshop the project teams also provided to the Bank the final written
summary reports for each project area and a central summary. The-full list of participants is in
Attachment A. This report summarizes the main issues and conclusions identified by the project
teams for each component.
Component A. Health Management aird Reform
The Government learned the rationale for regional health planning (RHP) through the
Bank's sector study: Long Term Issues and Options in the Health Transition (1992), which
analyzed trends in the main health problems and in health sector resource allocation. The sector
study team made two important points: (a) health development will increasingly become the
responsibility of regional (city or prefecture) governments; and (b) there is a coexistence of
resource shortage with waste and duplication; therefore RHP is needed.
Accomplishments and Effects
1.    RHP has been widely disseminated beyond the project areas. Project guidelines have
been a key reference and new national guidelines are being prepared.
2.    RHP has become national policy, in large part due to the project. Minister Zhang
Wengkang, the new Minister of Health, has listed RHP as an important priority for the
health sector.
3.    RHP initiated better coordination between provincial, city and local health services.
4.    The project developed strong capacity in health planning and project management,
through very stable project teams. At least half of the meeting participants had worked
for the project for over ten years, and many had been with the project for over five years.
5.    Rationalization of health facilities is having two effects: (a) pushing excess trained staff
to community level; and (b) seeking new roles for middle-sized hospitals owned by urban
districts. They will need to provide more outreach, rehabilitation and community
services.



32                               ANNEX C
Challenges
How to increase coverage of health facilities by RHP. RHP reforms do not cover all
major health facilities and services in the regions. Some important groups are not yet
accountable to the region's govemment or health committee with respect to health
investment: especially state owned enterprise (SOE) health services, private clinics and
private practitioners. To improve resource use, RHP needs to include these subsectors.
The new national guidelines should address this issue.
2.     How to adjust the use of public funds, taking into account private expenditures. Private
investment in health facilities could alter public recurrent financing priorities away from
national health policy objectives.
3.     How to ensure adequate financing of the recurrent costs of public health services. This
remains a problem throughout the country, particularly for preventive and promotive
health services and essential health care for the poor, which cannot be funded from user
charges.
Component B. Disease Prevention and Surveillance
Accomplishments
I1.    In general the group considered Component B to have been very successful, by
providing:
a.    an integrated strategy of disease control.
b.    improved policy environment for pubic health work.
c.    training in planning, implementation and evaluation of disease control.
d.     needed investment in physical facilities, equipment and vehicles.
e.    central level support in planning, monitoring, training, supervision and technical
advice.
2.     Outcomes for communicable (infectious) disease control:
a.    there were major big disease outbreaks during the project, which was attributed
to: health networking, health education and sanitation improvements.
b.    immunization coverage is very high.
c.    improved rural sanitation and water supply, especially in Baoji region.
d.     TB control was very successful, with reduction of prevalence and new cases;
introduced computerization of monitoring records; used the WHO recommended
short course treatment and strategy of: incentives to health worker for case
finding; treatment free to the patient; agreement signed with township hospital,
supervisor checks record, payment made on completion of treatment.
3.    For non-communicable disease (NCD):
a.    introduced a new  systematic approach to NCD  control, based on WHO
principles, integrating primary and secondary prevention with health education.
b.    intervention studies on NCD risk factors, smoking and salt intake.
c.     gained experience in case finding, community survey and data analysis.
d.    increased understanding of problems of injury, including traffic, suicide, falls,
poisoning.



33                              ANNEX C
4.    Endemic disease:  conducted, control programs for Kashin Beck disease, iodine
deficiency disorders and fluoros is.
5.    Disease surveillance was improved by enlarging the network of disease surveillance
points (DSPs), introducing morbidity (illness) as well as death reporting, and by
computerizing the information system.
The main deficiency which the group identified was inadequacy of the central support
program; the central level technical support was of good quality, but opportunities for
greater progress were lost because of central financial constraints.
Challenges
1.    For the DSP network: (a) feasibility and financing of the networks; some DSPs are not
receiving adequate funding to remain active, especially in rural areas, but this is the best
data the government can get on health problems and trends; (b) availability of technical
support and training from centrail level to provinces on disease surveillance; and (c) how
to improve morbidity reporting.
2.    For TB control:  (a) maintaining public funding for this successful, cost-effective
program. (Jiujiang and Jinhua reported ongoing government commitment for TB
control); and (b) effective retreatment of old cases which were poorly managed in the
past, and which may be drug resistant now.
Component C: Health Education
Accomplishments
1.    General capacity building, including:
a.    Established a functioning organization and framework for the health education
program within the project areas.
b.    Upgraded health education equipment and facilities.
c.    Professional training, through university courses and placements.
d.    Established annual planning process, to link the health education work program
to the main health concerns and initiatives.
e.    Supported the National PFatriotic Health Campaign Committee.
2.    Examples of specific achievements:
a.    Health education for EPI.
b.    Improved school health education, especially Jinhua and Jiujiang where all
schools were covered.
c.    Tetanus immunization  campaign  - Jinhua achieved  85%  coverage of
reproductive age women; virtually eliminated deaths due to neonatal tetanus.
d.    Smoke-free public areas.
3.    Major two year intervention study on smoking control in school students.



34                               ANNEX C
Challenges and Priorities
1.    How to ensure recurrent funding for health education.  Some project areas have
government budgets for health education, others not clear. It is expected that health
education entities will finance some of the recurrent budget from outside sources.
2.     How to strengthen central government leadership and professional development.
3.     How to consolidate use of modern communication and marketing methods.
4.    Priority topics for the future: infectious disease, hypertension, injury control, and health
of old people.
Component D: Maternal and Child Health Services
Accomplishments
1.    Established a method for practical, high quality surveys of maternal and child health, and
conducted baseline and follow up surveys.
2.    Maternal and infant deaths declined during the project period in all regions; for example
in Baoji maternal mortality ratio was reduced by half.
Challenges and Priorities
1 .    The project did not solve the well recognized problem of very high maternal mortality in
remote and mountainous areas. This is related to underlying financial issues and family
awareness, in the face of transport and communication difficulties and poor quality of
local services. Hospitals may charge RMB 300 for delivery which is annual income for
very poor families. Hospital delivery rates remain low.
2.    Public funding of the recurrent MCH budget is still insufficient. (It increased from 7-
17% of the health budget in Jinhua during the project, less in other areas.) Poor, rural
counties receive no funding from higher level for this service.
Component E: Emergency Services
Accomplishments
1.    Established 3 level network of pre-hospital and hospital emergency services, including
hotline with #120 and radio contacts. Adequate facilities and equipment; teams have
professional training and supervision.
2.    Increased public awareness of first aid, service availability and utilization of emergency
services over the project period.
3.    Established modern central blood bank facilities in the project areas (and in 10 additional
cities in Jiangxi province.)



35                              ANNEX C
4.    More cities outside the project areas are developing emergency services.
Challenges and Priorities
Although government and commnunity leaders appreciate this service, and there is general
consensus about its importance, several issues remain about the long term development:
1.    How to continue improvement to service usage and coordination.
2.    How to extend risk sharing or insurance for financing emergency services.
3.    How to improve work status and stability of the pre-hospital emergency staff.
4.    How to improve voluntary blood donations (still as low as 2% in some areas), and reduce
dependence on paid donors which are often disqualified because of existing disease.
Component F: Hospital Services
Accomplishments
1I    For physical facilities, which use over 40% of the project investment, major gains were:
a.    Controlled expansion cf hospital beds and development of new facilities,
rationalized location olf hospital facilities according to the needs of the
population, e.g., Jiujiang reduced from 6-3 large hospitals at city level, and from
10,344 beds for 3.95m pop. to 10,200 beds for 4.3 million population pop. This
achievement of amalgamation of major units was unprecedented in China, and
was achieved through project support of upgrading facilities and an extension of
the project period to allow completion of the negotiations. It is now considered a
national case study.
b.    Centralized the high level equipment and specialized diagnostic services in a
central hospital networked to others, with extended hours, improved quality and
cost containment.
c.    Improved rural and lower level facilities; greatly reduced the proportion of
substandard rural hospitals.
2.    Hospital management and service provision improved, including:
a.    broader hospital roles, including community services, outreach, prevention and
rehabilitation.
b.    successful infection control programs.
c.    cost control and new management systems.
Challenges and Priorities
1.    (as mentioned under Component A) How to extend planning control private and SOE
facilities (in Baoji 47% of hospitall beds actually belong to SOE facilities).
2.    How to reduce cost of care, length of stay.



36                             ANNEX C
3.    How to improve investment and service quality at primary care level.
Component G: Medical Rehabilitation
This component started from a very weak base compared with other components. There
was very little exposure to modern medical rehabilitation in China, yet the major increase in
health problems is in chronic disease and injury. In this project"the seed was planted, and began
to grow."
Accomplishments
1.    The key achievement was the introduction of the concept of medical rehabilitation, the
training of a core of professionals in rehabilitation and establishment of a modem
rehabilitation unit in a central hospital in each city.
2.    Raised awareness among leaders and health professional of the principles and methods of
medical rehabilitation, and the benefits in independence and productivity of patients.
3.    Exposure to medical rehabilitation in Hongkong and other countries through visits and
TA.
4.    Piloting of Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR)
Challenges and Priorities
1.    How to improve leadership awareness.
2.    How to coordinate and finance rehabilitation services, especially in rural areas.
3.    How to link effectively with community organizations.
Component H: Medical Education and Training
Accomplishments
1.    Greatly improved teaching facilities and student and staff accommodation.
2.    Introduced and reinforced curriculum reform, including more problem orientation, more
community placements, choice in subjects and courses. Introduced general practitioner,
nurse and technician training, improved assessment methods. Jiujiang school won a
national award for its curriculum.
3.    Introduced standards of service, including case management protocols.
4.    Improved the standard of the health workforce; for example, Baoji made a major effort
under the project to upgrade rural health workers, and improve county health schools;
Jinhua made a major effort in general practitioner training.



37                              ANNEX C
Challenges
Progress was uneven in the project areas, which face the same challenges as the whole
country in medical education. Those identified by the workshop participants include:
1.    How to adjust the different categories of workers trained. There is less need for mid
level workers, more need for college level training; but even these may be in excess, as
urban services are rationalized.
2.    How to strengthen and disseminate the teaching reforms, especially in community work
and GP training.
3.    How to increase the quantity and quality of retraining for the existing workforce.
4.    How to finance recurrent expenses, and further investment in teaching resources.
Component I: Equipment Management
Accomplishments
This component provided a rational approach to improving capacity and procedures for
management of the very rapidly increasing investment in medical equipment in China's health
sector, including project financed equipment.   However, the component faced major
organizational and financial difficulties as well as shortage of skills and experience even among
high level institutions, due to such rapid growth in the sector and the complexity of choices in the
market. Achievements included:
I.    Establishment of a professionally staffed and equipped equipment maintenance and
management facility in each project area. In two provinces these cover the whole
province.
2.    Adoption and dissemination of management systems and principles for medical
equipment at different levels.
3.    Rationalized procurement of high level equipment; greatly increased the utilization and
efficiency of equipment use.
4.    Improved bio-engineering and equipment management courses at top level universities.
5.    Improved methods, criteria and standards for assessment, installation and commissioning
of major equipment.
6.    Introduced the concept of appropriate technology for specific functions and local
situation.
Challenges and Priorities
1.    How to increase technical skills in this field to meet the need, and to avoid expensive
procurement mistakes.



38                             ANNEX C
2.    How to improve maintenance of large equipment items, and institutionalize preventive
