MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR AN INTEGRATED REGIONAL HEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.      I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
credit of $52.0 million equivalent (SDR 39.4 million) to the People's Republic
of China to help finance an Integrated Regional Health Development Project. The
proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity.
2.      Background.  Childhood immunization programs, accessible primary health
care, better sanitation and nutrition, and control of many infectious diseases
have contributed to remarkable improvements in health status. Life expectancy
has increased from an estimated 35 years in 1949 to 69 years in 1986, a figure
closer to the average of 76 years for industrialized countries than to the 61
years estimated for low and middle-income countries. A Bank study in 1984, Ihe
Health Sector in China (No. 4664), examined the policies and programs which have
led to China's achievements.
3.      As a direct consequence of its public health successes, China is now
facing disease patterns typical of more developed countries. Infectious
diseases have declined in significance as a cause of death, although they remain
a leading cause of morbidity. Heart disease, stroke, cancer and injury
accounted for 63 percent of mortality in China in 1986. These higher rates of
chronic disease are attributable in part to the population's increasing exposure
to risk factors such as smoking, dietary change, environmental and workplace
hazards. In addition, longer life expectancy, success in family planning and
the resulting increase in the proportion of adults in China's total population
have increased demand for health services among the middle-aged and elderly.
These demographic and epidemiological trends present a new challenge for health
planners in China to develop affordable but effective policies for chronic
disease care and prevention while addressing the lingering problems of
infectious disease.
4.      The Government's current health policy objectives are: (a) to strengthen
and consolidate health services through improving management of health
institutions; (b) to promote prevention and health maintenance by strengthening
disease prevention, surveillance, occupational health and maternal education and
by integrating prevention programs with basic health care services; (c) to
strengthen the training and increase the numbers of middle-level health
professionals by targeting enrollment to under-served areas and by expanding
curricula and improving education and training courses; and (d) to reform the
health service financing system by adjusting prices, implementing insurance
schemes and undertaking other changes to control costs and encourage efficient
delivery and use of health services.
5.      Project formulation.  A Bank study on China's health sector, now nearing
completion, looks prospectively at China's changing epidemiological pattern and
the need to realign strategic planning in health infrastructure. technology,
manpower and finances. Work on this report has proceeded in parallel with the
proposed project, and many of the policies and approaches to health services
that would be implemented under the project stem from the conclusions therein.



- 2 -
Experience from other countries facing epidemiological shifts similar to China's
suggested that a regional approach had many strengths. The overall trend in
China toward decentralization implied that the project should center on the role
of provincial and local governments, at the same time supporting the leadership
role of the MOPH in establishing health policy and providing technical guidance.
Broad sectoral issues--of medical technology, management efficiency and
effectiveness, institutional coordination, human resource development and
changes in pricing and payment of health services brought about through economic
reform--suggested the project should address the need for integrated planning
and improvements in services across a variety of institutions and types of
health care.
6.      Rationale  for IDA Involvement.  The Bank Group's strategy for assistance
to China in the health sector is to help the MOPH and its counterpart bursaus at
the provincial level to bring about the reforms needed in policy and
institutional structures to address the changing health needs of China's
population. The proposed operation would introduce approaches that experiment
with translating the Government's health policy objectives into program
initiatives in a small number of regions which could eventually serve as models
for development of health systems in other parts of China.   The Association
would bring to the project the experience of its staff and that of international
and national planners and managers to improve health planning methodology, to
design policies to reduce inefficiencies in health services, and to focus
attention on future trends and their implications for health care. Initial
assistance in these areas was provided to MOPH and the participating project
areas during project preparation.
7.      Prolect Concent and ObJectives.  Combining features of a traditional
project loan and sectoral investment, the proposed project is aimed toward
providing a systematic framework for integrating health services in a given
region, introducing new approaches to health policy and planning, and improving
the delivery and evaluation of health services. The framework is established
through detailed policy guidelines to stimulate and direct local decision-making
and a system of regional health planning with emphasis on annual reassessment
and budgeting in light of experience. The Policy Guidelines stress the need to
set priorities for health investments and programs, formulate reforms and
incentives to reduce waste and mismanagement, develop institutions capable of
sustaining improvements in service delivery, and monitor progress and outcomes
of efforts to improve the quality of health services. Regional health planning
under the project would move beyond the current approach of amalgamating upward
the budgets and proposals of various health units without a strategic
perspective, toward an approach that is analytically based and integrates the
objectives and roles of health-related institutions of different levels, both
within and outside the formal health sector.
8.      Project Description.  Preparation of the proposed project culminated in
the drafting of indicative, five-year regional health plans and design of
supporting components at the provincial level for three project regions. The
project comprises the establishment of health regions at Jinhua (Zhejiang
province), Jiujiang (Jiangxi province), and Baoji (Shaanxi province) to
experiment with new ways to improve capability for planning and delivery of
health services by establishing policy criteria and systems for financing
investments in the regions and supporting investments in the provincial
capitals. The regional and provincial project components are: (a) health
planning, management and reform; (b) disease prevention and surveillance; (c)
health education; (d) maternal and child health services; (e) emergency



-3.
services; (f) hospital services; (g) rehabilitation; (h) medical education and
training; and (i) equipment management.  Medical education, health educatiou and
emergency service investments at the provincial level will receive additional
support beyond that needed to just support the project region, in order that
provincial capabilities in these key areas will be improved. Appraisal of the
project was based on the overall soundness of the indicative five-year plans,
their compliance with the Policy Guidelines, the apparent commitment and
capacity of the regions to sustain regional health planning and the specific
budgets for the first year of the plans (1989). As appropriate to each
component, the project would support construction, purchase of equipment and
vehicles, technical assistance, training, incremental operating costs for new
and expanded programs of health services, maintenance and additionally required
staff. (Detailed project costs are in Schedule A).
9.      A national component would strengthen management capabilities of the
MOPH through policy evaluation, development and dissemination of cost-effective
strategies and technical guidance in each of the project components. The
specific objectives would be to enable MOPH: a) to provide leadership, policy
and technical support to the regions and provinces in experimentation and reform
of health service planning and delivery in the implementing regions; b) to
review and approve the annual plan and budget proposals from each region and
province and to supervise implementation of the project; c) to undertake studies
and policy research on health system development issues for the three provinces
and regions; and d) to distill and disseminate the experience during
implementation of the five-year regional plans, with a view toward policies and
practical, cost-effective approaches that could be replicated across the project
regions and in other areas of the country. The total cost of the project is
estimated at $113,0 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
$15.7 million (14%). Costs eligible for financing under the Credit and incurred
after January 1, 1989 would be retroactively financed up to 10% of the credit
amount. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in China are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7632-CHA
dated April 11, 1989, is also attached.
10.     Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following actions:
(a) the provinces will make available to their respective regions part of the
proceeds of the credit for carrying out the project on terms and conditions
acceptable to the Association; (b) the Provincial Project Offices would be
maintained throughout project implementation with appropriate functions and
staffing; (c) the Government would maintain the World Bank Loan Off'ce within
MOPH throughout the project implementation period with appropriate functions and
staffing; (d) the Government and the Association shall annually prior to the
beginning of each of China's fiscal years exchange views on the progress
achieved in carrying out the Policy Guidelines, the Regional Health Plans and
the provincial components under the project; the Government shall ensure that
during it's fiscal year disbursements by each of the implementing regions and
the provinces out of the proceeds of the Credit will be made only after the
broad parameters of such fiscal year's program and budget under each of the
regional health plans and provincial components shall have been reviewed and
found to be generally acceptable by both MOPH and the Association. Conditions
for credit effectiveness would include signing of Project Implementation
Arrangements between MOPH, the provinces and the regions with terms and
conditions acceptable to the Association.

11.     Bsnefits.  The programs and investments unde- the project would improve
the quality of health services available to an estimated 10-12 million people in
the three project regions and provincial capitals. Officials in the regions and
provinces would gain experience in new approaches to health planning, budgeting
and coordination. Experience at the regional level with implementing policy
reforms to strengthen health sector management would encourage better use of
scarce resources and increased responsiveness to local needs and should provide
many lessons relevant to the replication of approaches in other parts of China.
At the national level, the project would strengthen the capability of MOPH to
formulate and use polizy guidelines, rather than direct budgetary con_rol, tc
influence development of the health sector at the regional level. A wide range
of health institutions and government health bureaus would develop capacity to
design and conduct chronic disease preventior. programs, increase efficiency in
management and develop better coordinated systems for delivery of health
services. In addition, the project would help to improve the relevance of
medical education and training to priority needs for health care in China. Most
importantly, China would gain experience with the use of health regions as an
approach to the problems facing future development of the health sector.
12.     Risks.  The main risk of the project is that it will take some time for
planning and finance agencies and for other sectors to understand and adequately
support health sector reforms at the local levels. However, based on the
experience of the project preparation during the last year, there is little
doubt about the MOPH's commitment to carry out an experimental project of this
kind, and local level interest and support for new approaches to health
programs. Complexity of the issues and bureaucratic inertia, however, may
result in gradual change in strategies, including some which may take longer
than the project life to materialize fully. Regular, joint supervision by the
MOPH and by IDA will be important to ensuring continuous domestic and external
monitoring, evaluation and reformulation of project activities in the context of
the annual reviews of the regional health plans.
13.     Reconmepdatio .  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

than the original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
