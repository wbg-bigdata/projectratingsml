REPCRT AND RECCM4lNDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND A PROPOSED CREDIT
T3 THE REPUBLIC OF' LIBERIA
FOR A SE-COND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan for the equivalent of US$3.0 miUion and a proposed development
credit for the equivalent of US$2.6 million to the Republic of Liberia
for a second highway project. The loan would have a term of 25 years,
including five years of grace, with interest at 7 1/4 percent per annum.
The development credit would be on standard IDA terms.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report on the current economic position and prospects of
Liberia (AW-25b), dated June 1, 1971, was distributed to the Executive
Directors. A Bank economic mission visited Liberia in March 1973 and
is currently writing its report, which is expected to be ready in July.
The following assessment incorporates its preliminary findings. Country
data are given in Annex I.
3.        The main features of Liberia's economy are the foreign invest-
ment enclaves of iron ore mining, rubber plantations and tinber concessions
prospering alongside a largely underdeveloped rural economy of subsistence
farmers. The per capita GDP of about $250 1/, of which a substantial portion
is repatriated abroad or retained in the enclave sector, obscures the real
extent of poverty in the country (per capita GNP = US$200). Distribution
of national income is very uriequal1 and the roughly 70 percent of the
population engaged in traditional agriculture has an average per capita
income ranging from $55 to $80.
4.        While economic growth (GNP) in the second half of the l96O0s
was just under 4 percent annually in real terms, it slowed down
to 1.3 percent in 1971 and then picked up to 4.5 percent again in 1972.
The slowdown in 1971 was largely due to a mild recession in the world
iron ore market (iron ore accounts for about 71 percent of total exports)
and continued weakening of export prices for rubber. However, the situation
improved in 1972 as European demand for iron ore increased and rubber
prices showed some improvement towards the end of the year. The adverse
external developments weakened the budgetary situation in 1971. In
December that year, the Government negotiated an IMF Standby Arrangement
!/ Liberia's national accounts series were substantially revised by the
recent economic mission.



-2-
for 4 million SDR's. The budgetary situation improved in 1972 partly
due to substantial cuts in expenditures, and there was no need to draw
on the Standby. Budgetary revenues are estimated tlo have risen to about
$78 million in 1972, about 11 percent above the previous year's level,
due partly to increased excise taxes, maritime revenues and close to
$4 million in extraordinary nonrecurring revenues. The budgetary current
surplus rose from $20.1 million in 1971 to $22.8 million in 1972--i.e. from
about 4.8 percent to 5.1 percent of GDP.
5.        Despite weakened international demand for its key export
commodities, Liberia's foreign trade surplus averaged about $65 million
in the past two years. This trade surplus is more than offset by
sizeable factor payments abroad. These have amounted in recent years
to about $80-90 million annually and consist largely of returns on
investments by foreign concessionaires. Merchandise exports increased
by about 8.8 percent in 1972 (compared to 5 percent in 1971) partly due
to an improvement in the iron ore market, but also due to the continued
increase in the proportion of processed iron exported from Liberia. There
are no official balance of payments estimates for Liberia, but net public
and private capital inflows appear to more than offset the deficit on
current account.
6.        Development outside the enclave sector in the past has been
hampered by the absence of sectoral investment programs, weak project
preparation characterized by "ad hoc" decisions at a ministerial level,
limited savings and inefficient public administration. However, the new
administration of President W.R. Tolbert, which formally took office in
January 1972, is committed to take steps to remedy     these deficiencies.
The Government is anxious to strengthen the entire planning mechanism and
has requested Bank advice and financing for technical assistance needs
for this purpose.   This request is now being discussed with UNDP. As_a step
toward'sa long-term development program, the Bank's economic mission, in
preparing'its final report, will outline a suggested public investment'--
program for the next five-year period.
7.        The Tolbert administration has made agriculture its first
development priority and has stressed the importance of an integrated
rural development approach so that benefits can be spread more widely.
The Government is also emphasizing the need for greater efficiency in
public administration.  A Civil Service Commission has been set up to
look into the establishment of an organized civil service system (salaries,
merit promotion, pension schemes, etc.)   and a newly established    '
Public Administration Institute, financed by USAID, will provide training
for middle and higher level civil servants. A reflection of the Government's
desire to improve the tax structure was the passing of a number of tax
measures in the first months of 1973. The regressive impact of the tax
system was somewhat lessened through a reduction of the tax burden on
low income families. An improvement in tax structure also took place through
t1te shifting of business taxes from a profits to a more enforceable gross
receipts basis.  Although the immediate revenue yield of the new measures
is modest, in the long run the revenue effect may be considerable.



-3-
8.        Another positive development is that the Government has
begun to strengthen its machinery for examining and reviewing concession
agreements. The Government has just completed the renegotiation of
its agreement with the major concessionaire, the LAMC0 iron ore mining
company, and has as a result achieved a significant increase in revenues.
A review of other concession agreements (iron ore, rubber and the increasingly
important forest sector) will follow. Revenue from concessions amounted
to about 25 percent of total government revenue. This contrasts with
the share of concessions in the economy--more than 40 percent of value
added (GDP) comes from the enclave sector and 85 percent of merchandise
exports.  The Government is rightly concerned not only with obtaining
additional revenue, but also with raising the domestic value added,
e.g. through local processing of wood instead of timber exports.
9.        Since 1970 foreign loans and grants have financed 70 percent
of total government development expenditure.  Disbursements of external
capital assistance averaged about $4 million annually, almost all for
infrastructure projects. In addition, technical assistance grants, mostly
from the United States, averaged about $10 million a year. These amounts
represent a considerable reduction compared to the 1965-69 period when
capital assistance averaged $13 million annually and technical assistance
$12 million annually.
10.       Public external debt outstanding at the end of 1972 was estimated
at $150 million. About 65 percent is owed to the United States (mostly
loans from USAID), 11 percent to Germany, 9 percent to IBRD and 14 percent
to suppliers (mostly Italian). In the last two years, debt service has
absorbed about 12.5 percent of export earnings net of factor payments and
about 22 percent of current government revenues. The level of debt
service is mainly a legacy from the past since the Government contracted
large numbers of suppliers' credits in the 1960's.
11.       Liberia's GNP may be expected to grow at an average annual rate
of about 4.5 percent in real terms in the next several years. This compares
with a projected population growth rate of 3 percent based on the latest
completed population survey. Prospects for rubber exports now seem a
little better. A recent Bank study indicated that rubber prices are likely
to stabilize at about 194/lb., considerably above the level in recent
years, by the mid-1970s. While the outlook for iron ore in the international
market is moderately good, Liberia will face increased competition from
Australia, Brazil and other countries; whose iron ore deposits are of a higher
grade. Over the longer run, therefore, Liberia's resources for economic growth
will depend, to an increasing extent, on the ability of the Government
to formulate and to implement sound development programs outside the
traditional enclave sectors. These programs themselves are essential if
Liberia is to improve the living standard of its people.
12.       Current_expenditure levels for health and education, maintenance
programs, anA.government salaries are inadequate; this will be
a constraint   on Liberia's potential public saving performance. With
reasonable success in efforts to mobilize public savings, budgetary
sources (current surpluses less debt amortizations) are estimated to



- 4 -
finance almost 30 percent of projected public investment over the next
five years. The United States, and to a lesser extent Germany, are
expected to continue to be major providers of external capital assistance
over the next few years. The Government is keen to broaden the base
for foreign assistance, and last October held a multilateral aid meeting
in Monrovia for the transport sector, attended by three multilateral and
seven bilateral aid agencies (para. 22 below). Over the past five years,
23 percent of the capital aid received on a disbursement basis (amounting
to a total of $40.0 million) has come from the Bank Group; 69 percent
from the United States, and 8 percent from other sources.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN LIBERIA
13.       The Bank has made six loans for projects in Liberia totalling
$21 million and the Association has made two credits totalling $8.4
million. IFC, which helped establish the Liberian Bank for Industrial
Development and Investment (LBIBD[) in 1965, has subscribed 25 percent
($250,000) of its share capital of $1 million.  The Bank's loans have
been for roads, port expansion, power and LBIDI; the credits are for
education and agriculture. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans, IDA credits and -FC investments as of March 31, 1973, and notes
on the execution of on-going projects.
14.       The first Bank Group lending operation was a $3.25 million loan
in 1964 for a road project (Loan 368-LBR). Engineering carried out by
the then Department of Public Works and Utilities was inadequate and
extensive redesigning was required. The Government requested a supplementary
loan of US$1 million, which was approved in 1965 (Loan 368-LBR amended).
Project execution on this and subsequent lending operations have been
generally satisfactory. The agriculture and education projects (Credits
305 and 306 respectively), both approved in FY 1972, signified a shift
in Bank Group lending strategy. Previous lending had gone almost ex-
clusively into infrastructure, and Liberia prior to that had been a
Bank-only country. While c otinuous support for infrastructure investment
will still be required -- particularly in transport, where urgent priority
needs remain -- more emphasis will be given to agriculture and education
in Bank/IDA lending operations in the future. Both of these sectors have
high priority in the Government's economic program. Because of inadequate
local capacity to prepare and implement development projects in the
agriculture and education sectors, technical studies and training are
important features of both projects in these areas. UNDP does not have
adequate funds to satisfy Liberia's technical assistance needs. And,
therefore, the Government has turned to the Bank Group for added help.
Besides providing technical assistance for specific sectoral purposes
through its projects, the Bank Group, at Government's request, has prepared



-5-
a report on development planning which calls for strengthening planning
through infusions of some further technical assistance. The recent
economic mission reviewed these recommendations with Government. Some
financial assistance for a planning team may be required as soon as the
Government has finalized its course of action in this area.
15.       In the next two years, we plan to propose funding for the first
of two rural development projects emerging from the studies provided for
under the FY 1972 agriculture Credit. A second education project is also
envisaged, as well as additional financial assistance to help meet further
urgent priorities in the road system. So long as the Government persists
in its efforts to improve economic performance, continued Bank Group
lending, on a blend basis, would appear to be justified. Liberia's rich
resources, being developed biy foreign private capital, provide the base
for long-term economic growth and should make an increasing contribution
to the resources available for development of the backward areas of the
country, provided there are improved yields from renegotiated concession
agreements. Since the overall level of Liberia's external indebtedness
is still relatively moderate in relation to foreign exchange earnings
-- despite the debt servicing burden on the budget -- the country is
in a position to assume some lending on Bank terms. On the other hand,
further IDA assistance should be considered on the grounds of the
Government's resolve to improve economic policies, the widespread poverty
in the country (particularly outside the enclave areas) and the time
required before budgetary constraints arising from high debt servicing
requirements can be overcome.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN LIBERIA
16.       Liberia depends almost entirely on roads for the internal transport
of goods and passengers. Yet, there is only one mile of road for every
10 square miles of land area -- one of the lowest such ratios in West
Africa. Moreover, much of this mileage (more than 50 percent) consists of
unsurfacea dry weather roads. Some areas are isolated and unable to
realize their full development potential. Because of this dependence on
roads, and because the existing road network needs improved maintenance,
upgrading and extension to potentially productive agricultural areas in
the interior, the Government continues to place high priority on road
development.
17.       The transport system includes about 4,200 miles of roads, 300
miles of privately owned railways, four seaports and five airports of
which two provide international services. The railways are owned by the
mining companies and haul almost nothing but iron ore. The seaports handle
about 22.5 million tons of cargo each year, of which about 90 percent is
iron ore. International air transport, particularly to and from other
West African countries, has increased by about 5 percent annually over
the past five years.



- 6 -
10.       The Liberian road network has been developed over the last two
decades with technical aid from the United States Bureau of Public Roads,
with early financial aid from the U.S. Export-Import Bank and suppliers'
credits. More recently, the USAID, the Federal Republic of Germany and
the Bank have also contributed to development of the road network. Apart from
the Bank's earlier highway loans, referred to in paragraph 14 above, the
Bank has also assisted the transport sector with a loan of $3.6 million
(617-LBR) approved in 1969 for development of the port of Monrovia.
19.       Liberia's priority needs in the transport sector, as identified
by recent studies, are (a) to alleviate growing congestion in and around
the Monrovia port -- a prime center of economic activity; (b) to upgrade
key primary roads and to renovate or extend secondary and feeder roads
into those rural areas where the Government's agricultural development
activities are or will be centered; (c) to establish an effective highway
maintenance operation within the Ministry of Public Works, which has
paramount responsibility in this sector. The latter is especially
important given the deterioration of existing roads and the inadequacy or
disrepair of highway maintenance equipment. These shortcomings resulted
largely from the past failure of the Government to institute an effective
highway maintenance system. The Government recognizes these needs and
is determined to deal with ther..
20.       Expenditures for highway administration and maintenance are
financed from the general budget. Over the 1968-72 period, annual
recurrent expenditures for road maintenance and for salaries in the
Ministry of Public Works increased from $1.2 million to $1.9 million,
or by about an average of 12 percent annually. The allocation for
maintenance operations alone rose by about 7.5 percent annually to almost
$1.0 million. Still, this effort is not enough to keep the network in
adequate condition.  The Governmenu realizes this and has indicated
that it is prepared to increase appropriations for maintenance operations.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
21.       A report entitled, "Liberia, Appraisal of a Second Highway
Project", dated May 1973 and numbered 103a-LBR, is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors. A loan/credit and project summary
is provided in Annex III.
22.       This project originated from two feasibility studies.   One on
highway organization and maintenance, financed by the UNDP with the Bank
as Executing Agency, was done by SAUTI Consultants of Italy in 1971; the
other was a report on the Monrovia Port access roads done by Stanley
Consultants of the United States and financed under a 1969 Bank port
loan (617-LBR). These studies provided the basis for a proposed Five-Year
Hignway Maintenance and Development Program (1973-77) prepared by the



-7-
Government with Bank assistance. The Program was the subject of a
highway aid coordination meeting in Monrovia on October 23-25, 1972,
attended by representatives of multilateral organizations and bilateral
donors.  The project proposed here was discussed at that meeting and
was appraised immediately afterwards by a Bank mission. Negotiations
with the Government delegation, headed by the Assistant Minister of
Finance for Fiscal Affairs, Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, took place on
April 18-26.
23.       The proposed second highway project, including several elements
to be financed by other agencies, forms an important component of the Five-
Year Program. This component consists of:
Part I. Items to be financed by the Bank/IDA:
(a) Upgrading of the Monrovia Bypass (8.4 mi.),
which serves the port of Monrovia, including
detailed engineering, construction of a
two-lane paved road and supervision of
construction;
(b) Technical assistance over a four-year period
Ci) to help reorganize the Ministry of Public
Works, with particular emphasis on improving its
capacity to adequately maintain roads and
equipment; and (ii) to carry out a special study
to promote the Liberian construction industry,
particularly for road works;
(c) Preinvestment studies, including:
i. Detailed engineering for:
- Key Monrovia port access ruads (the
United Nations Drive and a new two-lane
bridge);
- Totota-Ganta road (85 mi.), if a feasibility
study just completed by the British ODA
and now being analyzed, indicates that
upgrading is warranted;
ii. Completion of the feasibility study and
- preparation of detailed engineering for the
Paynesville-Robertsfield-Totota road (70 mi.);



- 8 -
iii. A feasibility study for the 15 mile
Monrovia-Mount Coffee Dam road leading
to a central water supply plant;
(d) Equipment for workshops
as required for highway maintenance operations.
Part II. Items to be financed by the United States Agency
for International Development:
Highway maintenance equipment and spare parts.
This will include new road maintenance equipment,
including an initial stock ot spare parts; spare
parts for reconditioning existing US-manufactured
equipment (about 85 percent of the fleet); radio
communication sets and traffic counters.
Part III. Items to be financed by the Federal Republic of
Germany:
Training of personnel to operate, maintain and repair
the fleet of highway maintenance equipment and to maintain
roads.
Part IV. Item to be financed by United Nations Development
Program:
A program coordinator, appointed to Ministry of
Public Works and reporting to the Minister, to
coordinate the various project components, and to
advise Government on overall implementation of both
this project and other aspects of the Five-Year
Highway Maintenance and Development Program.
Cost and Financing
24.       The total capital cost of the project, including the portions to
be financed by other agencies, is estimated at US$14.1 million, oI which
about $11.9 million is foreign exchange costs, representing about 84
percent of total capital cost, or 87 percent of the cost net of taxes.
Proposed Bank/IDA participation of US$5.6 million ($2.6 million IDA;
$3.0 million Bank) wil1 cover the foreign exchange costs of Part I, or about
39 percent of the total project cost.  Of this amount, about $50,000 would
finance retroactively the detailed engineering for the Monrovia Bypass.
The USAID has concluded an agreement with the Government to finance the
foreign cost of Part II, and certain local cost requirements, totalling



-9-
$4.4 million. The Federal Repub]ic of Germany will finance Part III,
or about $1.9 million equivalent. It has already made an initial commit-
ment to finance the costs of an expanded training program, involving
the equivalent of about US$700,000. An additional amount of about US$1.2
million equivalent will be required in mid-1974 to complete the total
training program. It is expected that the German Government will favorably
consider a request by the Liberian Government to provide this assistance.
The UNDP will provide about $0.1 million for the Program Coordinator.
25.       The Government will finance the remaining local costs of the
project, about US$2.1 million equivalent. In addition, the Government
will have to allocate funds to meet the recurrent costs of road maintenance
which will increase over the project period from about $2.0 million in
1973 to about.$2.9 million in 1977. These annual allocations are required
to assure adequate maintenance and regular renewal of equipment. The
amount proposed represents about 4.5 percent of the Government's total
annual expenditures in 1973 and appears to be reasonable. These various
costs have been discussed with, and accepted by, the Government.
Implementation
26.       The Ministry of Public Works will be basically responsible for
executing the project. The Program Coordinator (see part IV of project
description, para. 23) will play a central role, however, in coordinating
the various aspects of the project, in working with consultants and in
ensuring that other features of the Five-Year Highway Maintenance and
Development Program are properly implemented. Success of this proposed
project will depend greatly on close cooperation between the Government,
the Bank Group, the USAID and the German Government. Thus, the Program
Coordinator, who already has been recruited and approved by the Government,
the Bank and other participating agencies, will be crucial to the entire
effort. Several teams of consultants will assist in carrying out the
project and will be responsible for reorganization of the Ministry of
Public Works; training of staff; procuring highway maintenance equipment
and spare parts; preinvestment studies and supervision of the Monrovia
Bypass construction.  The consultants for reorganization, preinvestment
studies, construction supervision and the study of the construction
industry will be selected by the Government in agreement with the Bank/IDA.
Signing of Consultants' contracts for technical assistance for reorganization
and for detailed engineering for the Monrovia Bypass, will be conditions
for effectiveness of the Loan/Credit.
Procurement and Disbursement
27.       The Monrovia Bypass will be upgraded under unit price contracts
awarded on the Basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank Guidelines. Workshop facilities will most likely be built
by local contractors under unit price contracts awarded on the basis
of competitive bidding or by the forces of the Ministry of Public
Works. Workshop equipment will be procured on the basis of international



-10-
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. Highway
maintenance equipment and spare parts for reconditioning existing
equipment will be procured and delivered in accordance with USAID pro-
cedures. Special Bank Group assistance will be provided for a study
aimed at identifying appropriate measures to strengthen the Liberian
construction industry in order to increase--to the extent economically
feasible--its participation in construction, maintenance and repair works,
in particular for roads. This study will be carried out during the
execution of detailed engineering for the Monrovia By-pass.
28.       Disbursements from the loan/credit will be made for:   (a)
the foreign exchange component of the total cost of consulting services
for technical assistance, for construction, supervision and for pre-
investment studies and for the study of the Liberian construction
industry; (b) the CIF cost (Monrovia) of equipment imported for remodeling
and equipping workshops; (c) 66 percent of total expenditures (equal to
the estimated foreign component) under the construction contracts for
upgrading the Monrovia Bypass. Disbursements will be made first from
the Credit account, and then from the Loan.
Justification
29.       This project is designed to help the Government meet high
priority needs in the transport sector--an effective road maintenance
system and improved access to the port of Monrovia from important
agricultural areas. Tuie achievement of better maintenance would result
in a more durable and lasting road network, thereby reducing transport
costs. Under the most likely estimates of inputs, the maintenance
program proposed as part of this project would yield an economic return
of 30 percent. Even under the worst possible assumptions regarding
traffic volumes, vehicle operating costs and capital costs, the economic
return would be 16 percent. A sensitivity analysis shows the economic
return on the upgrading of the Monrovia Bypass to be 42 percent under
the most probable estimates of inputs.
30.       Implementation of the highway maintenance program will help
improve the overall skill level in the MPW. The total MPW work force
will remain about the same; however, upgrading of the Monrovia Bypass is
expected to create direct employment for about 150-200 laborers over
the 18 months construction period.

C.  PiZOJL.CTS INi EXI)CUTION
Loan 14o. 617 - Port Development
1.        This port project involved dredging the approaches and an area
within the Monrovia port to accormmodate bulk ore carriers and tankers;
provision of twc tugs and a pilot launch, as well as additional buoying
aJnd lighting of the navigable channels; consultants' services for feasibility
;tudies for the development of road approaches to the port.   Project execution
has been satisfactory.   The Bank has agreed, in principle, to the Government's
request that  funds still undisbursed be used to help finance an
overall study of port development needs in Liberia, which was stipulated
in the project.  Al supervision mission visited Liberia in January, 1973 and,
at Jovernment's request, has drafted terms of reference for the port develop-
mient study.
Locin llos. 684 and 778 - Power
2.        The loans to the Public Utilities Authority (PUA) have helped
finance the expansion of the Mount Coflee hydroelectric nlant; the installation
of two gas tulrbines at the Bushrod (Monrovia) plant; procurement and erection
of 42 miles of overhead lines in M4onrovia and 54 miles in outlying areas;
establishment of a new substation and related facilities. While project
executior has been satisfactory, PUA cannot complete payments on the Bank-
funded items.   There have been cost overruns mainly due to international
currency fluctuations and the purchase of larger generators than originally
anticinated. A request from the Government for a supplementary loan of $2.7
million is now being reviewed. Meanwhile, PUA has intensified its efforts
to improve its arrears T)osition and the Government has passed legislation
designed to reorganize the PUA into a more efficient operation.
Credit No. 305 - Education
3.        The education credit will help finance construction of, and provide
ecuipment for, t-o new multila-teral high schools in the north and the east,
each ofiering a wide curriculum in agriculture, mechanics and academic
,uhject ; construction of and equipment for a new college of agriculture
and forestry; expansion of a rural teacher training institute and construction
of an adjacent demonstration school; technical assistance and fellowships
for manpower and education planning, technical teacher training, secondary
education and project implementation. Some delay was encountered last year
in obtaining recuisite excatriate staff for the project unit and the original
effectiveness date had to be postponed. This problem has been overcome and
the credit is effective.
Oredit No. 306 - Agriculture
4.        The agriculture credit includes feasibility studies and preparation
of detailed investment proposals for two integrated rural development projects
-- one in Upper Lofa county in ncrthern Liberia; the other in Bong county in

the central region; a physical survey and detailed study of the Liberian-
owned rubber industry; a pilot rubber scheme to provide Liberian rubber
farmers with credits to rehabilitate untapped or poorly tapped rubber;
improving rice research; reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture and
training for Liberians to prepare investment projects. Effectiveness of
this credit also had to be postponed because of difficulties in obtaining
necessary staff for the project unit. A project manager was designated in
January, 1973 but left after a month because of irreconcilable differences
with the Ministry of Agriculture. A replacement is now being sought.
Loan No. 839 - Development Finance Company
5.          This loan will help finance foreign exchange costs of industrial
projects to be financed by LBIDI in 1972 and 1973.  The loan is effective.
