MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA
FOR THE FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for SDR 15.5 million
(US$19.9 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit
would be issued on standard IDA terms with 40 years' maturity and would help
to finance a forest sector development project. The project would be
cofinanced by the Finnish International Development Agency (FINNIDA) which
would provide a grant of US$2.8 million equivalent.
2.       Background.  In 1988, the forestry sector in Sri Lanka contributed
about RS 4.7 billion to the country's economy, or 4.21 of GDP. Industrial
processing of timber and paper products contributes an additional Re 1.4
billion. Forestry employs about 170,00 people and forestry products are the
country's major source of energy, accounting for about 71? of total energy
consumption and 94? of the energy used in households. However, the forest
land area of Sri Lanka has been shrinking over the last 25 years, primarily
due to the clearing of land for agricultural development. Illicit felling and
shifting cultivation have also contributed to the reduction of forests. Most
of the natural forests havy been logged over, and their stocking has been
reduced to a level which allows recovery to be achieved only by resting and
replanting. Over the last 50 years, the Forest Department has established
about 150,000 ha of plantations to expand the productive resource base.
However, most of these plantations, until recently, have not been tended or
managed. IDA's involvement in the sector since 1979 has brought a new
dynamism to Sri Lanka's forestry sector by starting forest inventories,
bringing most of the plantations and selected natural forest under management,
training staff, strengthening the institutional framework, and most
importantly providing considerable assistance to the Government in the
formulation of a Forestry Master Plan to guide the long-term development of
the sector. As a result of the ongoing IDA-led support, Sri Lanka now has an
up-to-date resource data base, a comprehensive sector development plan, and an
integrated sector investment program in forestry. This experience is now
being used to formulate forestry projects in Bangladesh, Korea and Nepal
3.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA conducted a Forestry Sector
Review in 1979 and identified a development course for the forestry sector of
Sri Lanka. It initiated the first phase of this development by providing
support through the ongoing Forest Resources Development Project (Cr. 1317-CE)
which became effective in 1983. Since then, a Forestry Master Plan has been
prepared, a Five-Year Investment Program has been formulated, the education of
professional foresters has started, and steps have been taken to introduce
modern forest management practices. IDA is thus in a sound position to
continue to lead the external support efforts needed to translate these plans
into action. Continuation of IDA support to the forestry sector through this
follow-up project would help channel assistance from other Donors and Aid
Agencies into the sector more effectively. Finally, given IDA's involvement



-2-
would ensure that the development undertaken is consistent with strict
environmental protection principles.
4.       Protect ObLectives.  The proposed project is designed to support the
implementation of a five-year time slice (1990-1994) of the Forestry Master
Plan. The main objective of the project is to improve the performance of the
forestry sector in line with the economic, social, and environmental
expectations of the Government throughs (a) the intensive management of all
plantations and natural forests; (b) the establishment of an environmental
management aystenl; tc) expansion of the resource base by establishing new
plantations; (d) expanding and augmenting professional and technical education
and training; and Ce) strengthening of the institutional base.
5.       Protect Descriltion.  The proposed project will be implemented under
the umbrella of the Ministry of Lands, Irrigation and Mahaweli Development by
the Forest Department, the State Timber Corporation, and the University of Sri
Jayewardenepura over a period of five years. The Forest Planning Unit of the
Ministry of Lands, Irrigation and Mahaweli Development will coordinate project
implementation. The project objectives would be achieved by support fors
(a) a FPorest Manaaement comoonent to enable the Forest Department to map and
complete inventories and forest management plans for 35,000 ha of young
plantations and about 100,000 ha of natural forests and carry out indicative
inventory of about 500,000 ha of natural forest in the Dry Zone. Under this
component the Forest Department, in coordination with the State Timber
Corporation, will also carry out a silvicultural treatment program for the
existing 60,000 ha of established ptmntations and 40,COO ha of natural
forests; (b) an Environmental Manazement comoonent to establish a capability
within the Forest Department to formulate and enforce environmental protection
standards to ensure protection and preservation of the environment and
biodiversity within the forest estate; and (c) a Plantation Establishment
comDonent to enable the Forest Department to expand the productive and
protective forest resource base by establishing and tending about 17,900 ha of
new plantations; (d) an Educatlon and Training comuonent to enable the
expansion of professional forestry education facilities in the University of
Sri Jayewardenapura and the technical forestry training facilities of the
Forestry School of Nuwara Elia; and (e) an Institutional Sunport component to
enhance the capabilities of the Forestry Planning Unit to coordinate forestry
sector institutions and to plan and monitor the development of the sector,
equip the Forest Department and the State Timber Corporation with an up-to-
date and functional information system, and provide infrastructure and
mobility for efficient program implementation. Implementation of the project
would require a technical assistance program consisting of 347 months of
international consulting expertise and 138 months local expertise. About 502
of the technical assistance input will be utilized for education and training
purposes, which would create benefits far beyond the five-year period of the
project. The remaining technical assistance inputs should be considered
modest in view of the anticipated modernization of the sector.
6.       The project cost is estimated at US$31.4 million, with a foreign
exchange component of US$12.4 million (39S). This includes an investment cost
of US$24.9 million (79?) and an incremental operating cost of US$6.4 (20X).
IDA would finance US$19.9 million (63S of total costs), includin; US$18.1
million of the investment cost and US$1.8 million of the incremental recurrent



-3-
cost. FINNIDA would provide US$2.8 million of grant financing for the
investment cosz of the technical education component, excluding civii works
and the investment cost of the program for the Forestry Planning Unit. The
total external financing of the project would be US$22.7 million (782 of total
cost, excluding taxes and duties). The Overseas Development Administration of
the United Kingdom (ODA) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
indicated that they would be willing to provide grant financing for certain
activities included in the project. However, scope and the extent of this
financing have yet to be determined. The Government is also pursuing possible
cofinancing from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). If the
Government of Sri Lanka reaches agreement on this cofinancing the IDA Credit
would be reduced by the amount applicable to the related activities. A
breakdown of costs and financing is shown in Schedule A. Amounts ana methods
of procurement and disbursement are shown in Schedule B. A time table of key
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Sri Lanka are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map, IBRD 21471, is attached.
The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7699-CE, dated May 17, 1989, is. being
distributed separately.
7.       ARreed Actions.  The Government of Sri Lanka has agreed on the
following actionss (a) to undertake all forestry operations according to
forest management plans; (b) to carry out a study to assess the future
direction of the Forestry MSc course and discuss it with IDA; (c) to maintain
a Forestry Planning Unit; (d) to establish separate profit centers for STC's
logging, sawmilling, wood treatment, and furniture manufacturing operations;
(e) to undertake a study to explore possibilities for privatizing STC's
sawmill operations; (f) to maintain separate project accounts; (g) to audit
Statement of Expenditures annually; (h) to maintain the Interministerial
Forestry Master Plan Steering Committee; (i) to reorganize the Forestry
Department's headquarters and expand its field organization; (j) to establish
an Environmental Management Division within the Forest Department
organization; (k) to maintain the University Coordinating Committee; (1) to
establish all forest plantations on lands formally allocated for forestry
purposes; and (m) to undertake a mid-term review of the project and discuss
the findings with IDA.
8.       Conditions of Credit Effectiveness are that:  (a) the Government has
made arrangements satisfactory to IDA for commitment of the FINNIDA financing;
(b) project coordinators for the Forest Department, State Timber Corporation,
and University of Sri Jayewardenepura have been appointed and are in position;
(c) the technical assistance team has been appointed; and (d) STC's log sale
prices have been deregulated.
9.       Benefits.  Through the project modern and economically and
scientifically sound forestry practices would be introduced in Sri Lanka.
These practices would increase the production of wood, provide greater
protection to the environment, and create employment opportunities for the
rural population. Altogether they would allow the country to meet most or all
of its requirement for wood and wood products over the long term. The various
physical components of the project have directly quantifiable benefits, mainly
increased wood production, which give an internal economic rate of return of
28X.



-4.
10.      Risks.  Possible risks include a delay by the Forest Department in
establishing the required organizational structure and enforcing the standards
for the forest management. However, to minimize this risk the project
provides for a fomal and well structured link between the Department and the
Ministry through the Forestry Planning Unit, which will closely monitor
project implementation. In addition the technical asesstance program provided
by the project is designed to eliminate all technical hesitations by the
Department. While direct project risks should be minimized, the ongoing
political disturbances may delay the start-up of some operations and cou:
prevent targets from being reac.ed at certain locations. This risk is
minimized by using conservative targets for these localities in the early
years of the project. Therefore even if political problems continue at
present level and at the present locations neither the economic viability nor
the development impact of the project will be reduced significantly.
11.      Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.

La    The status of the projects listed in Part A is described in a separate
report on all Bank IDA-financed projects in execution, which is updated
twice yearly and circulated to the Executive Directors on April 3o and
October 31.
Lb    As credits are denominated in SDRs (since IDA Replenishment VI),
undisbursed SDR credit balances are converted to dollars At the current
exchange rate between the dollar and the SDR. In some cases, therefore,
the uncisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount greater than the
original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
