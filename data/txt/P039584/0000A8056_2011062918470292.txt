                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has achieved its objectives despite having been traversed the difficult Argentine crisis of 2001/2002.

                         The metro line A is fully rehabilitated, although some connexions in the signaling system will be finalized, these do not affect the functionality of the line. In fact, line A has increased
                         its patronage despite the rolling stock not being renewed by the concessionaire.

                         The support given to the metro concessionaire at the beginning of the project meant that the government complied with its obligations according to the concession agreement,
                         contributing to the stable continuity of the concession.

                         The project has been extremely successful in improving safety and transport integration through the construction of a major transfer center in Moreno, facilitation transfer from the bus

                         system to rail. In addition, to 12 road/rail underpasses that have improved traffic crossings at major rail road intersections.

                         The Additional Finance of this loan helped enhance the above results, but also expanded them through the improvement of urban environment around more than thirty suburban
                         railway stations. The effect has been significant in the access to the station and the upgrading of the urban environment. The full impact of these intervention is being assessed in an
                         ex-post study.

                         Additionally, the project has been very successful in developing a battery of data and instrument for transport planning in the Buenos Aires region supported and maintained by thirty
                         well trained young professionals. This will be the basis of the planning team in the future metropolitan Transport Agency.

                         Finally, the project has managed to support and develop, in some cases, in other Metropolitan Areas transport planning and urban transport support projects with a comon vision .
                         The Metropolitan Areas include Rosario, Posadas, Cordoba, Mendoza and Tucum.
