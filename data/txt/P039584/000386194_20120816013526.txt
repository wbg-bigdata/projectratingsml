1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

Context at Appraisal

1.      The macroeconomic context: calm between crises. The project was appraised in October
1996, six years after Argentina adopted the Convertibility Plan, an economic program which had
brought a period of economic growth and macroeconomic stability to Argentina‟s economy. From
extreme hyperinflation and widespread instability in 1990, the country was in the midst of a period of
stable growth. While this period brought economic growth, sharp decline in inflation and reduced
poverty, the stability did not last long. By the end of the 1990s, the combination of a fixed exchange
rate, capital inflows, high fiscal spending and borrowing, appreciation of the currency due to internal
and external factors and the resulting loss of competitiveness led to a prolonged recession with high
unemployment, which ended up with the severe crisis in 2001. Real GDP declined by 18.4 percent
between 1998 and 2002. This volatile and fundamentally changing macroeconomic landscape – with the
project being appraised in a period of calm between two severe financial crises – framed the constraints
and possibilities of this project.

2.      Buenos Aires was and remains the most important urban center in Argentina. The project
was located primarily in the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires (AMBA), the center of the main
economic, commercial and industrial activities of the country. The AMBA consists of the federal capital
and 42 other municipalities, covering an area of over 16,000 km². At the time of project approval, some
of the suburban municipalities were growing at a rate of 17 percent per year. In 2007, 38 percent of
Argentina‟s population (approximately 13 million people) was concentrated in the AMBA.

3.      By the early 1990s the public transport system in the AMBA had deteriorated to a crisis
state. Although the greater Buenos Aires had one of the most extensive public transport networks in the
world – including 840 km of suburban rail (carrying 1.5 million passengers daily) operating across the
metropolitan area, 42 km of subway operating within the city of Buenos Aires (carrying 1 million
passengers a day) and an extensive bus network operating 15,000 buses (carrying 7.5 million
passengers) – years of under investment had taken their toll from the 1970s onwards. While the number
of private cars had been increasing, the deterioration of the subway and suburban rail services led to
sharp declines in the number of people using public transportation. Between 1970 and 1991, as the
population of the metropolitan area rose from 8.4 to 10.9 million people, both the subway and the
suburban railways lost nearly half their ridership. Due to the sharp increase in automobile traffic in the
city of Buenos Aires and corresponding rising air pollution and traffic accidents, the National Congress
announced a state of traffic emergency for the city of Buenos Aires in 1994 and created a special
committee comprised of representatives of the Transport Secretariat and the Municipality of Buenos
Aires. Consequently, strengthening public transportation became a crucial priority in reducing the social
costs generated by travel delays, traffic accidents, fuel consumption and health problems from air
pollution. It was also clear that the subway and suburban railways had a strong potential for alleviating
many traffic-related problems in the AMBA.

4.       Private concessions were a key element of the Government’s infrastructure and transport
sector strategy. In 1989 the Government passed the State Reform and Public Enterprise Restructuring
Law 23696 (Ley Reforma del Estado) which laid the foundation for a major reform program in the
public sector. It declared “subject to privatization? many public enterprises and services, which among
others included surface and underground railway services which were operating at substantial losses. By


                                                    1
1996, Argentina had gone further than almost any developing country in privatizing infrastructure
services. The Bank was largely supportive of this strategy and, with World Bank Group assistance, ten
infrastructure sub-sectors were restructured and privatized during 1992-95. Privatizations included
obligations for private investments that improved service to customers and turned loss-making state
agencies into well managed profitable firms. Nevertheless, developing transparent, workable regulatory
frameworks to facilitate private financing and management of infrastructure services at sub-national
levels was still a challenge.

5.      In the transport sector, the Argentine Government decided in 1991 to concession both
Ferrocarriles Argentinos (the inter-urban and suburban passenger rail system) and the
Subterraneos de Buenos Aires (the subway) to private operators. The privatization program
included six inter-urban rail packages and seven suburban packages in the AMBA – which included the
subway system. The privatization of a railway system of this magnitude was unprecedented, more so
since five of the seven concessions offered to transform the subsidy into an operating fee payment later
on in the concession.

6.      A concession package was awarded to Metrovías in January 1994 which involved the
rehabilitation and operation, over a period of 20 years, of the subway network and the Urquiza
suburban railway which connects with it2. The rehabilitation of Line A of the subway network was
left out of the concession process due to legal problems and this Line was to be rehabilitated on the
Government‟s account. This Project therefore consisted of the investments necessary for the
Government to meet that obligation. If the investment were not to be made, the entire concession would
be at risk. Although most of the much-needed investment in infrastructure was expected to be made by
the concessionaire, the process still left a considerable amount of public investment to be made. 3 The
appraisal analysis reflected an assessment that without investment, Line A would collapse within a
period of 5 years (as discussed later – this turned out to be prophetic) leading to significantly inferior
outcomes for users (who would have to travel on buses adding to already congested roads) and non-
users (especially all current users of the corridor).

7.      By May 1995, almost the entire passenger rail system of the AMBA was operated by the
private sector. The initial results were encouraging and were largely attributed to improved service
quality and lower levels of fare evasion. In 1996 the suburban passenger volumes were 95 percent above
the level of 1993, and subway ridership had increased by 37 percent. Traffic gains were also fostered by
improvements in service reliability and security, particularly at stations. One key aspect of this
privatization was that consumers did not have to pay higher prices for this quality improvement.
Supervision of the concession was managed by the Federal Government through a specialized oversight
agency, the Comisión Nacional de Regulación del Transport de Argentina (CNRT). Both the
supervision and the concession were operating as envisioned.

8.      The complex multi-jurisdictional administrative framework is a key institutional challenge
for the sector in AMBA. One of the sources of inefficiency in the AMBA transport system was the lack
2
  The suburban Urquiza line was part of the subway concession package for technical reasons. Both systems shared the same track gauge
which differed from the rest of the network.
3
  The Government defined a minimum level of service to be provided by the concessionaire, and a fare structure for each line.
Concessionaires had therefore a strong incentive to exceed these service standards in order to claim a fare increase. A key design feature in
concessioning the suburban railways and the subway was that a monthly payment would be made to the successful bidder for each service
corridor over the terms of the concession contract. Moreover, the Government defined a plan of investments (track renewal, rolling stock,
signaling, telecommunications, electric systems, shops, etc) to be implemented in each line concessioned.


                                                                      2
of coordination and planning among the various jurisdictions and among the agencies responsible for
road management and public transport provision. Transportation in the AMBA was subject to the
regulatory and fiscal policies of the national, provincial and municipal governments. The AMBA
comprises the Municipality of Buenos Aires and 42 other municipalities in the Province of Buenos
Aires, which shared responsibilities for transport provision with some executive agencies of the National
Government. The lack of coordination among the several different actors responsible for urban/suburban
transport in Buenos Aires led to overlapping responsibilities, contradictions, poor decisions and areas for
which no one was responsible. A key challenge was to therefore support an effective planning and
implementation of traffic management, coordination of road traffic and public transport policy
implementation, and to support efforts to deal with the safety and environmental problems associated
with metropolitan transport.


1.1     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators:

9.      The original PDOs and key indicators (as approved in the PAD in April 1997) were:

PDO1. To support the private-public partnership in improving the service quality and coverage of mass
transit;
     On-time performance of Urquiza-line > 98%.
     Number of train cancellations < 2% of planned.
     Subway/Urquiza ridership up by the contractual amounts (defined in the concession agreement).
     Subway-Urquiza car-km increases as governed by the concession agreement.
     Subway service interruptions down to the levels specified in the concession agreement.

PDO2 To support the infrastructure improvements defined in the concession agreement between the
Government and the private sector; through
    Successful disbursement of the Loan related to Line A and Metrovías concession.

PDO3. To assist in improving the conditions of traffic safety and environmental quality; through
   Decrease in the suburban railway related number of fatalities by 25 percent.
   Start monitoring of air pollution in the city of BA.

PDO4. To help in developing an integrated urban transport (road and rail) system for the AMBA;
through
     Conversion of the UEP into a formal planning and management agency4.
     Conversion of the Steering Committee 5 into a permanent body responsible for metropolitan
       transport policy.
     Increased professional capacity in planning agency.
     Defined increase in the use of public transport by car-owning population (to be established in the
       transport study).



4
  It was intended to be a planning and management agency for all urban areas in Argentina.
5
  At appraisal the Government expected to create an inter agency steering committee, with a view to strengthen metropolitan
transport planning on a permanent basis, and to become the permanent body responsible for transport policy.


                                                             3
         Defined increase in transfers between public transport modes (to be established by the transport
          study).

1.2       Revised PDO and Key Indicators

10.    An additional development objective was added to scale up the project following the
Additional Financing Loan:

PDO5. To help in developing integrated urban transport strategies in Argentina‟s largest Metropolitan
Areas? in order to expand the development impact of the project to other cities in Argentina (other than
the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area). The Key Indicator for the PDO was the adoption of consistent and
coherent urban transport strategies in such cities as Rosario, Cordoba, Posadas, Tucuman and Mendoza.

1.3       Main Beneficiaries

11.     The beneficiaries were: (i) the system users, residents of the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area,
particularly the low-income population who live in the suburban area and who rely on public transport
and who benefit from a safer and upgraded rail system; (ii) all of the stakeholders in the private-public
concession agreements including passengers, government and the operators to be both supported and
strengthened as a result of this project; and (iii) the non-users of the system, all residents of the AMBA
benefit from the improved governance, the safety and environmental enhancements to be facilitated by
the project. A positive environmental impact was expected through the reduction of fossil fuel
consumption and motor-vehicle related emissions, the introduction of an air pollution monitoring system
and the reduction in road congestion with consequent improvement in air quality and noise pollution.

12.    The additional financing brought a fifth additional development objective to adopt consistent
and coherent urban transport strategies in five cities of the interior. Therefore, urban residents from other
metropolitan areas were relevant beneficiaries as well.

1.5       Original Components:

13.  The project was comprised of the following project components as per the Project Appraisal
Document and Loan Agreement (December 10, 1997):

Component 1.Buenos Aires Subway Infrastructure Improvement (US$134 million): Finance the rail
equipment and infrastructure which are critical for the upgrading of public transport services. This
component had two key subcomponents. The first was to finance $50m of $142.6m in payments due by
the Government to the concessionaire of the subway in the 1997-1999 period as part of the concession
agreement to partially finance investments in the rehabilitation of the subway system. The other was to
finance the rehabilitation of the publicly operated Subway Linea A – tracks, stations, communications,
signaling and electric systems – also an obligation of the Argentine government under the terms of the
concession agreement for the rest of the subway system;

Component 2. Urban Transport System Integration (US$18 million): Promote the integration of the
transport‟s system by upgrading transfer stations among rail lines, building better transfer facilities
between rail and road-based transport, and generally improving road access to rail stations. This



                                                     4
component included the construction of transfer stations at select key sites and accessibility
enhancements to a number of suburban rail stations;

Component 3. Traffic Safety Enhancement and Environmental Monitoring (US$32 million): Improve
traffic safety and environmental conditions through the construction of grade separations at high-volume
road/rail crossings, the enhancement of controls at road-rail grade crossings, the development of a
complementary program of road safety actions, and the introduction of systematic air pollution
monitoring; and

Component 4. Institutional Strengthening (US$16 million): Strengthen the institutional framework
which would ensure the continued operation of an economically and environmentally sustainable
transport system in the metropolitan area. This component included a number of technical studies and
investments to support the development of a core planning agency that could become the kernel for an
eventual metropolitan transport authority for the AMBA6.

1.6        Revised Components:

14.     Components were revised when the World Bank Board approved the additional financing
loan (see below). During the crisis, US$50m of the loan were diverted to finance the health and
nutrition components of Argentina‟s social emergency program. 7 Consequently the following activities
were cancelled: (i) environmental monitoring; and (ii) two of the three planned transfer centers. This
project was not alone. Other infrastructure projects in the Argentina portfolio were also restructured to
attend to the emergency. This decision was fully endorsed by the project and country team. The
Additional Financing Loan later allowed for the increase in funding levels in the original components in
order to cover financing gaps caused by a combination of inflation and the aforementioned reallocation,
and to reinstate some of the activities cancelled during the crisis. Furthermore, additional sites were
added for access (as part of Component 2) and grade-separations (as part of Component 3).

Component 5. Planning in cities of the interior. One additional component was added, which focused
on the planning of studies in a selection of cities in the interior of the country.

1.7        Other significant changes:

15.    Extensions of closing date. The closing date of the original project was extended on three
occasions. In 2002 the closing date was extended for 2 years as part of restructuring the project after the
2001 crisis (see paragraph 26). Subsequently, in mid-2005 (with more than $150m of the $200m loan
disbursed) recognizing that the project was performing at a high level and despite the difficult context, a
one year extension of the closing date (to December 2006) was granted to accommodate delays in the
execution of two contracts due to complicated technical issues (in Linea A) and consultation-related
delays in a grade-crossing contract. Throughout 2005 and 2006, implementation progress (IP) was
excellent and IP was rated Highly Satisfactory. A final 6 month extension of the closing date through
June 30, 2007 was approved in November 2006 primarily to enable the completion of the complex Line
1 contracts.

    The core (formal) planning agency refers to PLATAMBA
7
    This component was rated Satisfactory in ISRs throughout project implementation.


                                                              5
16.      Additional financing. A three year Additional Financing Loan was approved by the Board on
March 27, 2007 for US$100 million aimed to finance costs associated with: (i) covering the financing
gap derived from the reallocation of loan resources during the crisis (paragraphs 14 and 15), and to
cover unanticipated higher costs for civil works; (ii) financing implementation of modified project
activities as part of a partial project restructuring, including new technical assistance to cities other than
Buenos Aires to prioritize and design urban transport projects; and (iii) financing the implementation of
additional activities to scale up the project‟s impact and development effectiveness, including 6
additional road/rail separated crossings in the AMBA.

17.     Extension to the additional financing. By May 2009, the PDOs were largely on track. Outputs
and disbursements of the Additional Financing Loan were also on track. However, some implementation
delays were registered in 2009 due to a combination of internal procurement procedures which extended
beyond the scope of the PIU and some delays related to getting consensus with communities on designs
for grade crossings. The closing date for the Additional Financing was extended for one year from June
2010 to June 2011 to accommodate these delays.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry:

18.     The project was prepared within a context of the Bank‟s ongoing dialogue with the Borrower and
fully aligned with the World Bank Group‟s Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the Board on May
4, 1995 which sought to: (a) consolidate and deepen structural reforms; (b) reduce poverty and develop
human resources; and (c) rebuild the greatly deteriorated infrastructure base. These priorities were all
immediately relevant to the urban transport sector, and the project directly addressed these objectives by
supporting reforms in the AMBA‟s urban transport sector and by financing the rehabilitation of long-
neglected transport infrastructure.

19.      An innovative and comprehensive approach. While there was no recent history of Bank
investments in Argentina‟s urban transport sector, in many ways the project design epitomized best
practice in the manner it reflected the lessons and learning from other sectoral interventions in the
region. The focus on supporting rehabilitating and upgrading existing urban rail services built on a
successful history of similar interventions in Brazil, where a very successful high impact set of
investments in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro were showcasing the potential for high returns from
rehabilitation of existing urban rail infrastructure. In addition, the project complemented an ongoing
structural transformation in the sector oriented around concessions by supporting Government to fulfill
its related investment commitments.

20.     Strong focus on institutions and capacity building. The project‟s strong focus on capacity
building and institutional strengthening also reflected the lessons from sectoral experience in the region.
Bank experience across the region and elsewhere had indicated the need for continuous and long-term
engagement to build capacity, support the development of planning tools and institutionalize the
planning process. The project‟s strong focus on these elements – financing a series of tools, studies and
training programs to support planning – is best practice and has been a transformational feature of the
Bank‟s intervention.




                                                      6
21.      Risks. No formal risk framework was in place at the time the original project was appraised.
While the PAD highlighted a range of risks, mostly associated with investment projects – namely time
and cost overruns – the risk of a financial crisis and extreme macroeconomic instability was not
anticipated or highlighted. In light of what actually transpired, the value of a formal risk assessment
framework that would systematically incorporate broader country and sectoral issues (such as today‟s
Operational Risk Assessment Framework instrument) is clear. However, the project team was not alone
in failing to anticipate the worst crisis in Argentina‟s history. At appraisal Argentina was considered an
international showcase for its ability to put an earlier decade of macroeconomic instability behind it, and
there were few inklings of what lay ahead. In addition, both the original project as well as the AF Loan
could perhaps have been more sensitive to the risk that the institutional objectives of having a fully
established multijurisdictional transport planning agency in place would depend largely on the political
process, outside the Project‟s scope.

22.     Adequate and extensive participatory process. The project design included an extensive focus
on consultation and participation. It should be noted that, in this respect, this project was a leader in the
pioneering of many participatory practices that have since been institutionalized across the Bank, but at
the time were not mandatory and reflected global good practice. The planning process for Component
Two – which dealt with upgrade of stations and rail crossings, was thoroughly participatory in nature.
Rather than selling pre-selected subprojects, consultations conceived the possibility of public rejection
of individual subprojects and their replacement by others. Project preparation included environmental
screening for proposed road crossings, a more in-depth Environmental Assessment and the design of a
Community Consultation Methodology. A detailed Resettlement Policy Framework for cases of
displacement by the grade separation subprojects was formulated, with clear rules for the minimization
of disturbance and for full compensation in case of damage. Further details of the consultation process
can be found in Section 2.4 under Safeguards Compliance.

23.     Quality Assurance Group (QAG) Assessments. The project was assessed by three different
QAG panels during its lifetime. A Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA1) rated the soundness of project
design, the appropriateness of the project and the strength of Borrower ownership all as Satisfactory.
Realism and quality of the Project Implementation Plan was rated Highly Satisfactory. A separate
Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA5) also determined that the project was ready for
implementation. Finally, a Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio-1 (QALP-1) in 2008 assessed the
additional financing and found it to be the correct choice of instrument that appropriately responded to
factors such as good performance of the project and responsiveness to client needs. This assessment
found that the project specifically addressed identified sector issues, and arrangements to deal with
country risks; that policy constraints were addressed within the timeframe; and that institutional,
environmental, social and financial aspects adequately built on the original project. However, this
assessment identified that the outcomes expected from PDO 4 (to help in developing an integrated urban
transport system for the AMBA) which related to institutional change were somewhat ambitious given
the progress thus far and expected actions outlined in the AF.

2.2    Implementation:

24.     Good progress before the crisis. The project became effective on March 18, 1998, 10 months
after signing, once the project implementation unit (PIU) was established. Project implementation
commenced and accelerated between late 1998 and the beginning of 2000, by which time US$74m (or
37%) of the original loan had been disbursed The Project‟s Development Objective (DO) and


                                                     7
Implementation Progress (IP) ratings were classified as Satisfactory from the time of Board Approval
(May 1997) up until December 2000. By early 2000, most of the civil works contracts and other
measures were well underway prior to the onset of the crisis.

25.     The project was severely affected by the recession starting in 2000. In 2000 budget pressures
quickly mounted and the Government budget allocation for the year was only 22% of the amount needed
(US$19.6m of US$90m) to carry out scheduled works. Track renewal and station rehabilitation contracts
came to a standstill. All crossing schemes were stopped. The Greater Buenos Aires Urban Transport
Study was rescinded after months of disputes between the Consultants and the Transport Secretariat.
Amidst this, the Mid-term Review of the Project took place in November 2000. While several options
to restructure and restart the project were discussed, no agreement was reached, and the DO and IP were
downgraded to Unsatisfactory in late 2000.

26.     The crisis. In 2001, the budget allocation for this project was eliminated altogether, and all
project components were brought to a standstill. The country found itself in desperate need of liquidity,
and all investment implementation came to halt. Economic growth was negative for three consecutive
years. In December 2001, Argentina suspended payments on its external debt and restricted deposit
withdrawals. In January 2002, the country abandoned its peg to the U.S. Dollar. Reflecting
continuing uncertainty over financial conditions, interest rates continued to rise and the currency
depreciated significantly against the U.S. Dollar. This crisis led to frequent changes in political
leadership which led to paralysis at the political and leadership level. In this period starting late 2000,
though several alternatives were discussed to allow elements of the project to proceed - including as part
of an Argentina Portfolio Review in November 2001 - none of these attempts succeeded until late
2002.

27.      Restructuring. On October 16 2002, the project was finally restructured. As part of the
restructuring US$50m of the loan was reallocated to other programs (see paragraphs 14 and 15). The
Restructuring reflected an agreement on an Implementation Plan and a Procurement Plan going forward.
It also included the first extension of the project, for 2 years (from December 31, 2003 to December 31,
2005) in order to complete the stalled works. Implementation regained strength after this restructuring,
particularly after May 2003 when the incoming Administration assigned a high priority to completing
the Project and resolving issues which had previously paralyzed its execution (such as contract
renegotiation – see paragraph 34). The project was upgraded to Satisfactory status for both IP and DO in
May 2004 reflecting improvements in performance and stable political commitment. The key
institutional and policy issues advanced under this project would be carried over under the Argentina
Urban Transport in Metropolitan Areas PTUMA-APL (P095485) that was approved by the Board on
October 20, 2009. The PTUMA APL picked up the metropolitan coordination agenda and the Federal
Government agreed to make the creation of the metropolitan agency a trigger for PTUMA APL 2.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

28.     M&E System Design. The M&E system of the original project was appropriately designed to
measure the achievement of the development objectives of the original design through a combination of
output indicators and outcome indicators. These indicators were appropriate. The project development
objectives were relevant to the situation of urban transport in Buenos Aires at the time. However, with
the exception of indicators that related to compliance with the concession agreements, no baseline
values of the indicators were provided at the time – this was not unusual for that time (there was no


                                                    8
mandatory Results Framework in place at the time of Board Approval of the original Project). Due to
the delays in project implementation, the Bank Team relied mostly on output indicators to assess
progress.

2.4      Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance:

29.    Safeguards Policies at Preparation. The project was appropriately designated as an
Environmental Category “B?. Two Safeguards policies were triggered under the original loan:
Environmental Assessment (OP4.01) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP4.12). A third Safeguards policy
was triggered upon the approval of the Additional Financing Loan, Physical Cultural Resources 8
(OP4.11). An Environmental and Social Management Manual (ESMM) prepared at appraisal of the
Additional Financing Loan provided adequate and detailed prevention, mitigation and compensation
measures to address the potential impacts identified during sub-project preparation, implementation and
operation. In the case of Subway Line A, special measures were prepared to address the potential
impacts on stations that had been declared historical heritage. A Resettlement Policy Framework was
prepared at appraisal stage and was part of the ESMM.

30.     Safeguards Policies at Implementation. Safeguards compliance was rated Satisfactory
throughout the entire implementation of the project with a brief downgrade to Moderately Satisfactory in
2008. This was due to the fact that it was not possible to carry out one of the railway underpasses due to
a discussion with a few members of the community over potential water flow problems and the similarly
long period and large amount of resources allocated to additional environmental and hydrological
studies. This experience highlights the challenges of developing and implementing projects which, even
though they may have significant overall merit and societal value, cause disruption to a few. With the
exception of this experience, there were no significant issues related to safeguards policies during
implementation.

31.     Consultations were carried out appropriately and in accordance with Bank policy. Social
development issues were incorporated into project design and implementation at every level. A Social
Development Specialist in the Bank‟s Country Office worked closely with the local communities to
protect the safety of the people where road bridges over the railway were proposed to be constructed as
part of the project. The Bank Team used the railway safety issue to encourage participation of the local
communities in the project.

32.     The use of such consultation was evidenced on how the project handled a specific case of
compensation in the AMBA. In 2004, a letter was received by the Bank from a group of citizens living
in the vicinity of the project (Ituzaingó) who voiced concerns regarding the availability of information,
the environmental management plan and the level of the compensations paid to mitigate negative
impacts. The Municipality explained the measures which were being taken to address these issues (many
beyond than what was required by the Bank) and agreed to publish an advertisement in the local press to
inform citizens that claims were being answered on a daily basis at the Municipality and to keep the
community informed as the works progressed. The explanations provided by both the PIU and the
Municipality were handled properly, and this process was monitored carefully. Complaints were
8
 During the implementation of Line A rehabilitation, there was recognition that the old subway line was a form of valuable
cultural heritage, and it was treated as such. The project was pioneering in the manner with which it dealt with a metro line as
heritage (among other measures it is possible to ride in restored old 19th century trains on weekends (see paragraph 52) and
when the AF was appraised, it triggered OP4.11 on account of this component. This OP only came into effect in 2006.


                                                               9
analyzed and assessed in accordance with the social framework in place for the project. 9 It is important
to note that most initial consultations took place several years prior to the full execution of the project
(due to the standstill which resulted from the crisis). This experience highlights the continuous nature of
consultations needed to ensure that the process is truly participatory from beginning to end.

33.    Procurement arrangements were generally well designed and supervised. Procurement
arrangements for the project approved in 1997 were appropriate. The project showcased an unusual level
of innovation in the application of Bank procurement guidelines. Metrovías, a private company selected
through a competitive process was allowed to use its own commercial procurement procedures for some
contracts financed by the Bank: as part of Component 1 loan proceeds were used to finance Government
payments towards investments to be made by the concessionaire, and the concessionaire used its own
procurement rules to complete the investments. The Bank made payments against indicators of output.

34.     After the crisis, the Bank played a constructive and significant role in supporting a difficult price
renegotiation process for contracts let before the crisis. On the flip side, a procurement assessment was
undertaken for the period between April and October 2007 in response to significant delays in
procurement processes linked to administrative bottlenecks regarding Government processes outside of
the PIU which required multiple, repetitive approvals. A Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR)
of the Argentina Portfolio took place in June 2009 whereby delays in procurement processes were
identified as a cross-cutting issue affecting portfolio implementation in the country as a whole. This
procurement delay was also flagged in the QALP-1 in 2008. The need to bid or re-bid some lots under
Component A and to advance some of the works under Component B also represented a challenge for
their completion by the closing date of the project. In 2009, due to delays in procurement processes, the
IP rating was slightly downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory and despite the preparation of an Action
Plan, the rating remained Moderately Satisfactory until the project closing date.

35.     Financial Management (FM) aspects were in compliance with Bank policy. The initial Highly
Satisfactory progress was brought to a standstill during the 2000-2003 economic crisis, getting back on
track once the project regained its pace of implementation. In the period between 2003 and 2007, the
PIU was issued qualified opinions and numerous recurring observations relating to internal control
weaknesses and delays in the full implementation of the UEPEX, thereby creating opportunities for
accounting entries and assignation errors. However, the Bank assessment found these errors not to be
material, and the FM assessment of the AF in 2007 determined the overall financial management risk to
be modest. However, in 2009 the FM assessment of the UEP performance was downgraded to
Moderately Satisfactory due to lack in rigor in some tasks. The PIU complied with the Action Plan
agreed to in order to improve FM performance. Overall, the PIU and FM arrangements, with few staff
rotations, remained effective and functional during the 13 year implementation span.


2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase:



9
 The Esteban Echeverria underpass EIA (subproject of Component B) underwent consultations and several months later
some neighbors presented criticisms of the EIA, the subproject‟s location (impact on a public park space) and the
consultation process. The Bank agreed that the EIA needed improvement and the PIU ensured all processes were carried out
adequately and criticisms of the EIA were evaluated. Ultimately this subcomponent was cancelled in large part because no
satisfactory solution could be found agreeable to all stakeholders.


                                                           10
36.     All the major works financed by the project have been successfully completed and are in
operation. Line A has been successfully rehabilitated and reflects a major upgrade and one of the most
significant investments in the quality of public transport in Buenos Aires during this period. The grade-
separated crossings and improvements have been completed (in a few cases works were completed after
the closing date of the AF loan – in those cases some were partially financed by PTUMA, but in all
cases supervision of the works continued), inaugurated and are now successfully in operation.

37.     One of the most significant and lasting impacts of the project has been the enhancement in the
technical capacity for planning and policy analysis. The combination of a very successful set of studies,
tools and capacity building efforts (see below) has created two complementary units – one with a high
capacity for executing works and the other with an impressive ability to support planning and policy
development (the PLATAMBA office set up and initially supported by the project).

38.     While the Bank continues to support what remains a rich agenda with significant investment
needs and complicated policy/institutional aspects with a new project (PTUMA) – it is worth
highlighting the important role that the PLATAMBA office is playing. This office – now staffed by
approximately 30 trained transport professionals (trained as part of the Additional Financing Loan) is the
Federal Government‟s primary support for transport issues both in the AMBA and in the rest of the
country. This is the office that is implementing the ambitious and thus-far very successful electronic
fare card project (SUBE) which is seen as the vehicle for future reforms in the sector.

39.     Nevertheless, there are at least three major issues that need to be highlighted in the context of
future sustainability of urban transport in the AMBA:

         (i)      the need to establish a metropolitan transport authority with some statutory power to
                  facilitate inter-jurisdictional concerns. In this respect the PLATAMBA office set up as
                  part of the Project and supported by the project is expected to be the kernel for such an
                  agency;
         (ii)     address the issue of operator subsidies, which were instituted after the crisis to keep
                  transport costs low but now need to be dismantled10. The current Federal Government
                  (which has financed these subsidies since the crisis) has recently stated that dismantling
                  this system of subsidies (which also extended to water and energy sectors) is now a near
                  term priority. The challenge will be to dismantle this system in a manner that minimizes
                  social disruption, provides support to the most vulnerable users, reinforces efficiency and
                  service incentives for operators (who now recover close to three quarters of their revenue
                  from subsidies) and frees up funds urgently needed for infrastructure investments. The
                  instruments financed by PTUBA have established the analytical foundation for
                  forthcoming urban transport subsidy reform; and
10
   The subsidies were a result of the Government‟s strategy to keep fares affordable in the aftermath of the crisis within the
structure of the concessions that regulated the operations of the urban transport system. While the low fares were
undoubtedly a helpful element of the social safety net in the immediate aftermath of the crisis, the policy affected the
incentives for efficiency in the concession agreements. In the subsequent years, the low fares became politically difficult to
address and the aggregate level of subsidies kept rising. The PTUBA Additional Financing Project Paper flagged the subsidy
as an important emerging concern for the sector, but noted that the issue was still too politically sensitive to be discussed. At
the time the new operation PTUMA was appraised, the issue was already considered critical to sector sustainability and was
discussed at length in the PAD. Due to the very political and sensitive nature of the debate, Bank support in this context was
focused on creating the technical tools – data, models, surveys – that would help government effectively design and
implement reforms of the subsidy regime once the political economy facilitated it.


                                                               11
         (iii)   the future of the concessions. The concessions for both the subway and suburban rail
                 systems were renegotiated after the crisis, but are still in place and will only start
                 terminating in 2016. Though no definite statements have been made for post-concession
                 management arrangements, future sustainability will require the development of a robust
                 regulatory and management regime that has the incentives for careful and efficient
                 management and can facilitate new investments in the system. At this point in time, there
                 would be value in a comprehensive assessment of the concession experience with a
                 forward-looking view for future arrangements.11

40.     These are all difficult long-term problems that are inherently political in nature. While outside
agencies such as the Bank, with the technical/investment support that it can provide, can support
building blocks to help policy makers design solutions, lasting solutions to these issues lie ultimately at
the political and governmental level.


3.       Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation:
41.    The objectives remained relevant according to the Bank’s priorities in Argentina. Urban
mobility and a focus on public transport through improved infrastructure as a means to support multiple
goals of urban congestion, air pollution, greenhouse gas pollutants and provide mobility and access for
the low-income passengers has remained a core element of the Bank‟s sectoral strategy.

42.     The PDO remained valid throughout the life of the project and did not require adjustment to
accommodate changing Government priorities in response to a shifting macroeconomic context. Despite
the standstill during the crisis, the Borrower remained committed to the PDOs of the project. A fifth
PDO was added at the time of approval of the Additional Financing Loan which required that planning
studies similar to those being undertaken in the AMBA be expanded to other Metropolitan areas in the
country.

43.     The Project Design also remained relevant. It allowed the advancement of a significant and
complicated policy agenda around a targeted set of investments. As a result the design remained relevant
in the face of significant deterioration of the macroeconomic and fiscal environment.

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives:
44.     The achievement of the overall PDOs is considered Moderately Satisfactory based on the fact
that out of the five indicators, three have been generally achieved and two have been partially achieved.
A detailed assessment of outcomes and outputs related to all five PDOs can be found in Annex 2.
Briefly,

        Assessment of PDOs achievement resulted from measuring attainment of PDOs against the
         outcome indicators defined in the project’s result framework an d project outputs, with one

11
  The project had few dealings with the concession beyond supporting the Government‟s share of the capital works in the
initial years of implementation. The project was not designed for/did not envision a close supervision of the concession
agreements. The CNRT, a federal government agency was responsible for controlling and regulating the concessions prior to
Bank‟s involvement. Institutions for supervision of the concessions were assessed at appraisal and deemed to be reasonably
effective.


                                                            12
          exception (the case of PDO3). In the case of PDO3 (assist in improving the conditions of traffic
          safety and environmental quality) the outcomes and outputs specified in the PAD (which have
          been attained) have been supplemented with an assessment of difficult-to-measure aspects of the
          environmental quality impacts of the improvements in intermodal and station access.

         Successful completion of works led to completion of outputs and subsequently the
          attainment of outcomes in the case of PDO1 (support the private-public partnership in
          improving the service quality and coverage of mass transit), PDO 2 (support the infrastructure
          improvements defined in the concession agreement between the Government and the private
          sector) and PDO3. In the case of PDO1, the impacts of the project are very substantial and
          significant – Annex 2 presents evidence that without this project the service quality and coverage
          of mass transit in Buenos Aires would have seriously deteriorated. However, some of the
          performance outcomes (mainly those related to demand targets) on the rail system were not met
          – in general system wide ridership (on elements of the system affected by the project and those
          outside it) fell considerably at the time of the 2001 crisis and has not yet fully recovered. There
          were delays in the implementation of Line A – in part due to the crisis and in part due to
          technical complexities. Although these delays did not materially affect benefits12 outcomes for
          PDO1 are considered only partially achieved in light of the mixed performance data. Successful
          and timely completion of works implemented by the concessionaire, lead to timely disbursement
          of the related Bank loan component and PDO2 is judged to be fully achieved. In the case of
          PDO3 the targeted safety outcomes were achieved with the completion of the grade-crossing
          outputs, and the investments in public transport transfer and access facilities materially improved
          the environmental quality of the public transport system in the AMBA. PDO 3 was considered
          achieved.

         The capacity building and institutional change outcomes targeted in PDO 4 (help in
          developing an integrated urban transport system for the AMBA) were only partially
          achieved. Specifically, the project contributed to significant enhancements in capacity both for
          implementation of works and technical planning. However, the goal of creating a permanent
          body responsible for metropolitan transport policy was not achieved – and has become a part of
          the agenda for the ongoing PTUMA project (see para 39).

         Planning and project-related studies under PDO5 have been completed or are close to
          completion in the cities outside Buenos Aires. The city of Rosario, in particular has adopted a
          comprehensive sustainable transport strategy. In the other cities, work is progressing adequately
          and is being supported by the ongoing project (PTUMA). Though there has been some delay,
          progress is satisfactory and there is no reason to believe that the minor delays will have any
          material impact on attainment of the objective. The PDO is considered achieved.

Please refer to Annex 2 for detailed individual discussion and assessment of each PDO.

3.3       Efficiency:


12
  The works were completed while Line A was still functioning (though as is discussed in Annex 2, the timing of the project
was opportune – the old electric systems broke down just as the new systems came on-line and any further delay in the Line
A works would have had significantly negative impact).


                                                            13
45.     At the time of appraisal, an economic analysis was conducted to assess the rehabilitation of Line
A and the initially selected grade-separated crossings. In the case of Line A, the analysis conducted a
cost-benefit analysis of the entire concession process (under the assumption that without the Line A
rehabilitation – which was already a Government commitment in the concession process- the entire
process would be at risk) as well as a stand-alone assessment of the Line A rehabilitation by itself. The
analysis suggested large economic benefits (NPV >US$340m under a variety of scenarios) for the Line
A rehabilitation by itself and significant additional benefits related to preserving the concession. For the
purposes of the ICR, the cost-effectiveness of the Line A rehabilitation as a stand-alone project are
simulated, incorporating the increased costs and delays in implementation. The benefits are assumed to
remain unchanged from appraisal. This is a conservative/realistic assumption because key variables
driving the benefit calculations (the assumption regarding the timing of the collapse of the original
infrastructure – which did indeed collapse approximately 5 years after the project commenced, and
levels of traffic in 2010 are about the same as at appraisal) have been realized. The analysis suggests
that although the delays and cost increases lowered the efficiency of the Line A investments to a certain
extent, the investments remain efficient with NPV‟s over US$300m.

46.     In the case of the grade-separated crossings, each crossing was justified on the basis of a
standardized economic analysis conducted as part of the feasibility analysis on an ongoing analysis. In
general the costs of the crossings and traffic volumes were in-line with the costs estimated during the
feasibility study. Additionally, the data on safety outcomes clearly indicate the high impact of these
relatively small investments. The efficiency of these crossings is rated adequate/Satisfactory.


3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
47.     Of the five indicators, three have been considered achieved and two as partially achieved.
Although the project was completed with adequate efficiency, there was considerable implementation
delay in achieving the results. The original loan was initially expected to be completed by 2003 but was
actually completed only in 2007. While this is not in itself unusual for large infrastructure projects in
any circumstances and less–so given the magnitude of Argentina‟s recession and economic crisis in the
midst of the project, IEG guidelines suggest that the delays could call for a reduction in overall project
rating.

48.    This rating is based on the combination of the project relevance, achievement of the objectives
and the achieved project efficiency.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts:

(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

49.    Although no surveys were conducted to document on specific poverty, gender or social
development impacts, the main beneficiaries of the project were low-income households on the urban
periphery that benefited from integration and safer transport service into the city.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening:




                                                    14
50.    One project focus was to strengthen the Government‟s role in partnering with the private sector,
made more important by the onset of the crisis. The Bank focused on sustainability in institutions,
working on strengthening technical capacity in planning and its expansion through training. The Bank
also worked steadily to develop consensus on a metropolitan transport authority and engaged in a
dialogue on how to address non-viability of subsidies. The perspectives of a follow-on PTUBA (which
developed into the PTUMA project) provided a sufficiently long-term framework for sustainability.

51.      During project implementation, the PIU trained 30 young professionals of the Transport
Secretariat in the area of transport and project management which was also a major achievement. As
implementation of the PTUMA project takes place, these young professionals will strengthen their
experience in this area and will contribute to the consolidation of rational transport planning in
Argentina. Indeed, 50 percent of the staff at the PIU is made up of the young professionals trained
under PTUBA. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the capacity building program, these young
professionals have become the leaders in the different areas required for such an agency to develop and
strengthen. One example can be seen in the training of a young professional in the transport modeling
field, such expertise was non-existent in Government prior to this project.


(c)      Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

52.    There are several positive outcomes related to project activities that are not fully accounted for
under the results framework and two in particular are worth highlighting:

             a. The role the project played in the Government‟s crisis recovery strategy, supportin g
                critical investments, generating local jobs and injecting liquidity into the economy.

             b. The cultural heritage value created in the Line A rehabilitation. The recognition that an
                early 20th century subway line could have cultural heritage value was first recognized by
                elements of Argentine civil society; but the project reacted to this recognition in a very
                commendable manner that created significant value. Working with civil society groups, a
                conservation plan was identified and implemented for elements of the old line –
                particularly the coaches. Today it is still possible to ride on restored train cars dated from
                1913 on Line A on weekends. This subway line, both modern and traditional, is now an
                integral element of the identity of the city of Buenos Aires.

             c. The project has an additional important attribute: the manner in which the Project
                facilitated an effective response to the needs of the post-crisis economic environment. In
                2003, as Argentina was looking to get back on its feet, the urgent need was to inject
                liquidity and jobs into the economy. The project played a material role in supporting this
                process – and was unusually flexible in its ability to respond appropriately to a crisis
                scenario. The grade crossings and works around stations in particular could be prepared
                and implemented quickly, and they were able to support important infrastructure needs
                while generating critically needed short-term local employment.13

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Significant
53.     As discussed above, the development outcomes of the project have been achieved satisfactorily.
All of the investments financed by the project are now operating in a satisfactory manner. The urban rail
concession has survived despite the economic crisis. The improvements in the suburban rail system, in
the form of station improvements, the Moreno transfer station and the crossings, have significantly
contributed to improving the quality of suburban rail in the AMBA. That said, as discussed in Section
2.5, some key issues need to be addressed to ensure long-term sustainability of Buenos Aires‟s public
transport system. Given the concerns related to inter-jurisdictional coordination and the challenges
ahead related to dismantling the public transport subsidy regime in a non-disruptive manner, the risk to
development outcome is rated as Significant.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry:

Rating: Satisfactory
54.     The project was well prepared and Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry was rated
satisfactory. The rationale for this assessment is summarized below:

55.     The project was rated satisfactory for well designed and well prepared. The QAG Quality at
Entry Assessment (QEA1) rated the appropriateness of the project and strength of Borrower‟s ownership
as satisfactory. This rating was supported at the Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA5). The
Realism and quality of the Project Implementation Plan was rated Highly Satisfactory by QEA1 and the
QSA5 agreed that the project was ready for implementation. Indeed, the QSA5 argues that the problems
encountered during implementation could not have been identified at entry.

The manner in which the Project pioneered participatory techniques before a formal Safeguards driven
mandatory regime was in place is commendable. Equally commendable and innovative is the manner in
which the Bank supported the Metrovías concession – financing activities procured by a competitively
chosen concessionaire using their own procurement methods.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies):

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Team did a moderately satisfactory job as evidenced by actions such as:

56.    Timely and frequent supervision missions during the implementation stage accompanied by
timely communication between the project Team and Bank Management (as evidenced by 33
Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) filed in the 1997-2011 period). Once the project came
to a halt, the Team downgraded the project to problem status in a timely fashion and sought senior
management‟s assistance in dealing with it in the context of the overall portfolio problems experienced
within Argentina. The attention of the supervision effort was very well focused on resolving the budget
problem which was stalling implementation. Various meetings were held between the Bank and high


                                                   16
level officials from the Federal Government and Buenos Aires City to resolve key issues. There seemed
to be strong “buy-in? at the meetings but unfortunately no actions were carried out later by the
Government due to the political and economic context. The Task Team showed patience and persistence
in trying to get the Government parties to comply with their commitments. Most actions agreed to in the
MTR were not carried out due to the country‟s worsening economic crisis. The Bank Team effectively
used the Portfolio Improvement Program (PIP) to elevate the project implementation issues into the
Bank-Argentina country dialogue and to press for a solution to the budget problem at the highest levels.

57.    The Bank carried out prompt and sound identification and assessment of implementation
problems as well as provision of high-quality advice and solutions to the Borrower to address the
implementation problems.

58.      The proactive, flexible and responsive nature of the Bank‟s supervision, especially during the
2000-2003 project standstill was particularly important. Team continuity, careful attention and support
from management, responsiveness to technical issues, thorough and cautious approach to governance
and risks, the continued focus on sustainability and long term objectives were all factors which
contributed to successful implementation and supervision. The evidence suggests that in the aftermath of
the crisis, the Bank team stayed engaged, flexible and proactive. It is to the credit of all parties
concerned, the Bank team, the Government and the implementing agency, that as soon as political
stability returned to Argentina after the crisis, the project restarted implementation and indeed played a
critical role in supporting both the economy and the transport system of greater Buenos Aires to weather
the crisis.

59.    Depth of country and sector knowledge allowed the Team to weather the project even in an
extraordinarily adverse fiscal environment. The Bank was consistently guided by the simple but
appropriate vision of the improvements in mass transport efficiency and security, including through
expanding the dialogue on subsidy policies.

60.    The Country Management Unit (CMU) actively supported the Team with communications with
relevant ministries and helped secure the agreement of the Government to the Team‟s proposal to
increase the financing percentage.

61.   Timely and diligent attention to fiduciary and safeguards issues through the project
implementation period took place.

62.     QALP1 – 2008 – Quality of Implementation stated the appropriate management focus on long-
term development goals and sector vision and the continuity of management and persistent commitment
to sector development objectives.

63.     QAG Assessment: The Bank‟s efforts were recognized during the Quality of Supervision
Assessment (QSA5) by QAG. It was acknowledged that the project encountered extremely difficult
implementation problems exacerbated by poor public sector management and continuous changes to
project management. The Bank worked throughout the fiscal and economic crisis to keep the project on
track by seeking innovative and flexible solutions to deal with the inability and unwillingness of the
Government to allocate even minimal funds for project implementation. The assessment ranked “Focus
on Development Effectiveness? as Highly Satisfactory; the “Supervision of Fiduciary/Safeguards




                                                   17
aspects? as Satisfactory; the “Adequacy of Supervision Inputs and Processes? as Highly Satisfactory;
and “Realism of Project Performance Ratings? as Satisfactory.

64.     Nevertheless, it can be argued that the team had several opportunities to revise certain
weaknesses in the project‟s results framework, for example: (i) add baseline data missing in 3 out of 13
indicators, (ii) update progress on system performance indicators, and (iii) add specific indicators for
PDO5. In addition, the Additional Finance provided a good opportunity for these revisions yet they were
not carried out.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

65.     Despite an overall satisfactory quality of entry, an evident shortcoming in the second half of the
project implementation span was the team‟s missed opportunities to carry out multiple restructurings in
order to revise the results framework. For these reasons the rating is revised downwards to Moderately
Satisfactory.


5.2    Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

66.    In terms of design, the project was well aligned with Government‟s key priorities of the
concession process and related public-sector investments in the transport system, and reflected a
comprehensive view towards improving the performance of the sector.

67.     In terms of implementation, the Government offered strong and consistent support to most
elements of the project implementation except for the period immediately before and after the crisis.
Given the circumstances, this is not unreasonable. Nevertheless, implementation progress post-2004
was in great part affected by procurement internal procedures from 2009 until project closure in June
2011 which extended beyond the scope of the Implementing Agency. These delays were identified in
2009 as a cross-cutting issue affecting portfolio implementation. In addition, there were significant
delays in effectiveness for both loans, which is assessed as a systemic issue across the Argentina
portfolio.


(b) Implementing Agency Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory

68.     The consistent Satisfactory ratings during the first three quarters of the project for safeguards,
procurement and financial management clearly indicate the consistent and high quality performance of
the UEP during the early years. Implementation pace and quality were also consistently high except for
the period immediately before and after the crisis (when issues were outside the control of the UEP).


                                                   18
The UEP did a good job in helping to resuscitate the project after the new administration offered
political support starting May 2003. This required a combination of political tact, commitment and
persistence that is particularly worth noting.


69.      The PIU was able to coordinate and monitor all activities related to the project. It also
established and implemented a permanent system to link project activities with municipalities and
concessionaires. In addition, it took the necessary actions to ensure compliance with Bank requirements
in all aspects of the project, prepared periodic reports to the Bank as required and managed all project
accounting activities, including special account, disbursements and auditing reports. The focus of the
project on sector planning, institutional architecture and subsidy required a high expertise and
institutional capacity which was fairly constrained. This was adequately strengthened under the project ‟s
young professional program which required significant effort and commitment on the PIU side.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

70.     The overall Borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory, based on the combined
performance of Government and the Implementing Agency. While the consequences of Argentina‟s
major economic crisis led to the stalling of implementation for 3 years, the Federal Government and the
Buenos Aires authorities continued to hold to the project development objectives and provided the
momentum for additional financing, increasing the proportion of counterpart funding. The Government
demonstrated commitment to the PDOs by increased Government financing, and the focus on long-term
development goals. The post-crisis scenario was very positive, with strong disbursements and a strong
determination to catch up and implement the project, evidenced by the demand for the Additional
Financing Loan. Nevertheless, despite periods of strong commitment and an overall satisfactory rating
for safeguards in particular, the procurement and financial management constraints reported from 2009
onwards led to the downgrade to moderately satisfactory not only for both FM and procurement but also
for the overall implementation progress rating. Given that the downgrade was caused by issues that were
primarily outside the control of the UEP, the implementing agency performance is kept as Satisfactory
while the Government performance at Moderately Satisfactory.14

6.      Lessons Learned
The following lessons emerge from the analysis of the project done in this ICR
71.     Importance of flexibility in project design in view of unexpected outcomes. The PTUBA
project illustrates why it is critical to introduce flexibility in the design of a project so that in an event of
a crisis the project can survive and support a government recovery strategy. The flexibility in the
PTUBA project stemmed from a sound understanding that the project had to accompany heavy
infrastructure components with numerous small scale works. Immediately after the crisis the relatively
small scale works resulted in a quick way to respond to a post-crises economic environment by injecting
liquidity and local jobs into the economy.


14
  In line with IEG Guidelines, the difference in rating between Government (MS) and Implementing Agency (S) brings the
overall Bororwer performance rating to Moderately Satisfactory.


                                                          19
72.     Design of additional finance instrument, with its maximum three year period, in countries
with consistent delays in loan effectiveness might need reconsideration . Such loans still need to
traverse the same bureaucratic procedures in country as a regular SIL. One option may be to consider a
longer term for the AF instrument – though this project was one of the first AFs extending beyond three
years – more experience with AF has led to other similar experience. Alternatively a separate follow-on
operation could have been considered.

73.      Institutional integration agendas are difficult, political and time-consuming. Metropolitan
Transport Agencies are highly political and it remains a challenge to support such ambitious institutional
agendas within the constraints of the Bank‟s instruments for investment loans. A lesson learned for
transport operations is to more explicitly recognize the limitations of project implementers and overall
Bank instruments to catalyze such complex institutional reform. Additional lessons learned from
PTUBA are twofold: first, even in the absence of political will to lock-in multijurisdictional agreements,
the creation and collection of data and planning tools can be a valuable foundation for future planning
coordination; and second even though at appraisal the political environment might seem beneficial for
institutional change, project design should conservatively assess the risk of drastic political changes.

74.     Capacity building. Consolidation of transport reforms cannot be sustained without building
capacity for future generations of transport leaders. In the case of Argentina, there has been a virtual
absence of academic programs in educational institutions to develop a pool of professionally qualified
manpower for undertaking such urban transport planning. The existent educational curriculum was
tightly compartmentalized along academic disciplines, with no interdisciplinary programs in existence.
These limited the availability of skills that could conceptualize urban mobility in a comprehensive
manner. PTUBA illustrates how this challenge can be tackled effectively and sustained over time in
Bank projects.

75.     Transformative complementary approaches in urban transport. Other lessons that are
confirmed with the implementation of PTUBA are: that small scale accessibility projects can
significantly improve the mobility of public transit users, that public consultations can have a significant
impact in project design and community ownership, and that rational transport planning is paramount for
efficiency of resource allocation which can only be assessed when information is available.

76.     Importance of continuous consultation. As mentioned in the consultation section of this ICR,
participatory process need not only take place at appraisal or at the onset of a project. Lessons from this
project show that projects can benefit from consultations carried out continuously throughout project
implementation.

77.    Client-focused application of the Bank’s procurement policy can add a lot of value. The
innovative manner in which the Bank‟s procurement guidelines were adapted to the actual situation of
the Metrovías context was exceptional. The experience indicates the possibility for, and value created
by the Bank focusing its Procurement Guidelines to the actual needs and circumstances of the client,
adapting them pragmatically to the situation on the ground, all of which can allow the Bank to engage
and contribute to broader reform agendas.

Annex 2. Outcomes by PDO and Outputs by Component

PDO 1. To support the private-public partnership in improving the service quality and coverage of mass
transit; Partially achieved

78.     PDO 1 indicators were designed to quantify the impact of the specific infrastructure
improvements. Given the focus of the project on supporting investments in the subway 15 the ideal
indicators would probably focus only on the subway. 16 In terms of the subway, the available data
suggests that while all of the output indicators have indeed been met, the achievements in terms of
outcomes show mixed results. Most of the supply-oriented performance targets have been met (increases
in car-km, reliability), though the demand-side targets have not been met. This has little to do with the
project – ridership across the Buenos Aires public transport system fell by over 10 percent at the time of
the 2001 crisis and in many cases ridership levels have not yet returned to pre-crisis levels.

79.     However, the most important measure of the impact of the project had to do with rehabilitation
of Line A. The key output related to this PDO was the rehabilitation of subway Line A, which was fully
completed, though with delays. These impressive works – completed while the subway was still
operating – saved Line A from certain decay: in 2007, at a time when the new electrical systems for Line
A were in testing and weeks away from commissioning, the existing antique electrical systems collapsed
(Figure 1a and 1b show pictures of the old and new systems). In addition, it is worth highlighting that
Line A is a part of the city‟s historical heritage. It is the oldest line in the network with antique systems.
Its renovation necessitated substantial expert care and dedication since the major engineering required
attention to facilities (electric and signaling networks) that are no longer in use anywhere in the world. –

   Line A of the subway as well as the Bank support to Metriovías concession explicitly supported investments on the subway
system, though the Metrovíasa concession covers both the subway and Urquiza and therefore the results indicator covered
both.

   Data available for the Urquiza line suggests that key indicators were met: on-time arrivals of the Urquiza line was
maintained at 98% and the number of train cancellations was at 1% (less than the 2% planned). Ridership decreased in the
Urquiza line by 5.84% over the twelve year period (from 25.58 million in 1998 to 22.86 million in 2010) but this is not out-
of-line with overall trends in the economy and system ridership as a result of the crisis.

     80.     In order to respond to this crisis, testing and commissioning for the new systems was accelerated
     over the weekend – and the systems were successfully commissioned without any systems delays or
     adverse impacts to the public. In the absence of the project – there is no doubt that Line A would have
     stopped functioning at that time for an extended period until the antiquated electrical systems could have
     been restored in some manner. The level of disruption to the city would have been significant and the
     economic analysis for the Line A investment presented in the PAD provides some sense of the impact:
     high levels of delay and unacceptable levels of on-road congestion as passengers would have had to
     transfer to buses traveling on the surface. That the counterfactual (of not rehabilitating Line A) was
     nearly realized helps to focus on the significant impact of the project in terms of service quality and
     coverage of mass transit. Indeed, a case could be made that the DO related to improving the service
     quality and coverage of mass transit has been fully achieved given the significant impact of the Line A
     improvements which were made in a very difficult economic environment –but a partially achieved
     rating has been chosen given the delays (the delays were partly due to the crisis and partly due to
     procurement and complex technical implementation issues) and the mixed performance data.

81.   PDO 2. To support the infrastructure improvements defined in the concession agreement
between the Government and the private sector; Fully achieved

82.     PDO 2 indicators were designed to reflect successful completion of capital investments
envisioned as part of the concession –the disbursements of the Loan proceeds in a timely manner
would reflect that the Argentine Government had paid its share of the payments to the concessionaire as
required and that the concessionaire had completed the required investments as agreed (since Bank
payments were made only once investments were complete). This indicator was extremely ambitious –
and required completion and coordination of activities between the concessionaire, the Argentine Gand
the Bank (non-trivial coordination given the innovative use of the concessionaire‟s own procurement
processes for the works). In terms of outputs, the key output related to this PDO was the support
provided to the metro concessionaire in the period 1997-1999. The Bank support for this component
required a high level of innovation unusual in the general context of the Bank‟s procurement systems.
Consequently, this PDO was achieved on time by 1999 – by which time the loan had disbursed US$50m
towards payments to Metrovías for the period 1997-1999; the Government had paid all its obligations to
Metrovías during this period; and Metrovías had fully completed its investment obligations for this
period.

83.    Bank support for privatization was a relatively new approach at the time the project was
approved. There was little experience that was directly relevant to the project. What was understood
from significant experience from the urban transport sector in Brazil and the overall transport sector in
Argentina was that supporting governments in guaranteeing availability of counterpart funds for meeting
concession agreements is crucial to ensure concession sustainability and to reach project outcomes. That
this ambitious indicator was fully achieved is a testimony to the success of this objective.

84.     Finally, it is clear that PDO1 and PDO2 were very interlinked. The lack of a functioning Line A,
would have caused the entire transport system to collapse, and would have put the concession at high
risk. Line A is one out of 6 lines in the subway system and accounts for approximately 20% of the metro
trips in the system. It also runs central to the City of Buenos Aires and connects to the historic
downtown.

85.   PDO 3. To assist in improving the conditions of traffic safety and environmental quality;
Achieved

86.     By any measure, the project was successful in improving safety and environmental quality
in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area. In terms of project outputs, the project achieved (i)
construction of 12 grade-separated crossings prioritized to improve safety; (ii) construction of a major
transfer center in Moreno; and (iii) improvements in the access facilities around more than 25 stations.
Although some outputs were temporarily dropped, such as the air quality studies, the other transfer
stations and the automatic barriers, in the aftermath of the crisis (devaluation, US$50m of the loan
diverted, costs increasing over time), the most relevant ones were picked up and completed as resources
became available.

87.     The impact of the grade-separated crossings on safety can be measured concretely in terms
of quantifiable indicators. The PAD listed a 25 percent decrease in fatalities on the suburban rail
system. During the same period, actual casualties declined from 5 in 1998 to zero in 2010. Moreover
the numbers of events in which people were injured (either by being struck by a train or by falling off
from the trains decreased dramatically from 1,017 in 1998 to 80 in 2010. Finally, the number of injured
people decreased significantly from 638 in 1998 to 79 in 2010, representing a significant decrease.
Moreover, the number of accidents (being run-over by a train) decreased from 15 at appraisal (and 24
one year after appraisal) to 9 in 2010 and the number of injured passengers being run over by a train
went from 15 in 1998 to 1 in 2010. All these indicators together – perhaps more so than any single
indicator of fatalities17 - clearly indicate the significant impact of the grade-crossings on the safety and
the highly satisfactory impact of this subcomponent. The grade-crossings were significantly more
expensive to construct than estimated at appraisal, and were prioritized over automatic barriers. The
results suggest that this was an appropriate prioritization.

88.     Despite significant improvements on safety in the railway and subway lines financed by this
project, (the most unsafe crossings were selected by this project), it is important to acknowledge the
recent accidents which took place in the Once station of the Sarmiento Line. These accidents are a
reflection of the lack of investments in certain pockets of the suburban railway system.

89.     The impact of improvements in urban environmental quality is a multi-dimensional
attribute which remains difficult to measure with any small set of indicators. Certainly, the
indicator in the PAD – that air pollution monitoring in BA is started which would not in itself

17
  Annual system-wide fatalities are not always perfect indicators: fatalities are relatively rare events – with high variance
such that even single events (such as a collision between a train and a bus at an at-grade crossing) can cause many deaths that
can skew a fatality measure.


                                                              27
satisfactorily explain the impact of investments such as transfer centers and enhancements to access
around stations. These investments improve the environmental quality of the public transport
experience – by improving the environmental quality inter alia the safety, the security, the waste
management, the air pollution of access and transfer facilities – improving convenience, comfort,
security and ultimately quality of life. As it was, the environmental monitoring component was
cancelled as part of the mid-term review though the outcome indicator related to air quality monitoring
was indeed met: the city started monitoring air quality in 2009 after the most severe elements of the
economic crisis had receded. In addition, the investments in the Moreno transfer station and the station
access improvements have had a transformative impact which needs to be recognized (see Figures 2a,2b
and 2c). The transfer center in Moreno is an emblematic investment that not only significantly enhanced
safety and environmental quality in the station area but transformed the Moreno municipality. The
municipality used this intervention, which was one of the most significant public investments in the
Municipality in many years, as an opportunity to facilitate a significant upgrade of the blighted urban
downtown – complementing the transfer station investment with investments in adjacent public
facilities, zoning changes and business attraction.

90.     The improvements around stations – street lights, paving access facilities and
improvements to bus stations at suburban rail stations across the AMBA – were simple but no less
transformative. These small investments transformed the quality of access to stations: the street
lighting, investments in greenery and paving transformed potentially dangerous locations into attractive
urban environments where the community came together. Access was improved for all passengers but
particularly so for vulnerable populations: the lighting and presence of the community enhanced safety
and convenience for women; the improvements in the urban design made the facilities accessible for the
disabled population; children in the community got access to (often rare) public space. For these and
other reasons (these small scale projects could be quickly implemented immediately injecting money
and jobs into the local economy), these station improvements were quickly recognized as one of the
most important contributions of PTUBA.

91.     The station improvement program was expanded substantially as part of the Additional
Financing loan: scaled up from 3-5 stations in the original loan to over 25 by closing date and is
now a key element of the Bank’s urban transport strategy. Furthermore this program has been
expanded again in the new ongoing project (PTUMA Ln 77940-AR) and may ultimately finance up to
80 station improvements in total. This is likely the first Bank project that makes the link between
transport and urban development and its impact on passenger accessibility. Indeed, station improvement
has become a significant goal in terms of smart growth and transit oriented development. The approach
of these improvements is now being replicated in other projects across the LCR transport portfolio
including a PHRD18-financed project in Lima, Peru that focuses on mainstreaming accessibility for the
disabled by enhancing the environmental quality of access to mass transit stations. It is regrettable that
no adequate „outcome‟ indicators can be identified (not at appraisal and not at this time) to appropriately
reflect the multi-faceted impacts of these simple but critical station improvements. Indeed, if such an
indicator (set of indicators) could be identified and would have been mentioned in the PAD, this

 subcomponent would undoubtedly be considered exemplary.                        However, even given the available
 indicators, this subcomponent is considered achieved.

     Partially achieved.

 93. The project was successful in developing a series of tools and data that are instrumental for
     sustainable integrated rational long-term transport planning in the Buenos Aires region. In
     terms of outputs, the AMBA O-D surveys and transport study commissioned as part of the original
     project were cancelled due to contractual issues which could not be settled. The studies then
     commenced as part of the Additional Financing Loan. In response to lessons from the original
     study, the process has now been divided into a series of studies, some of which were completed
     during the Additional Financing Loan and others which are continuing under the ongoing loan. This
     approach makes for a longer study period – completing all the studies will likely involve 4 or 5
     different procurements and the entire process will likely take more than 8 years – but yields much
     higher quality and more useful results. In terms of outcomes, the project has also had a significant
     impact.

 94. The technical element of the project management unit (the UEP) has become a formal
     planning and management agency called PLATAMBA. The PLATAMBA – now staffed by
     approximately 30 trained transport professionals (trained as part of the Additional Financing Loan
     see below) is the Federal Government‟s primary support for transport issues both in the AMBA and
     in the rest of the country. This is the office that is implementing the ambitious and thus-far very
     successful electronic fare card project (SUBE)19 which is seen as the vehicle for future reforms in the

    SUBE (Sistema Unico de Boleto Elctronico) is a smart personalized fare card which can be used in all forms of public

 under the PTUMA loan. The SUBE registers the origin, transfers involved, and the destination of every trip, and provides
 real time data on who is using the system, match it with its socioeconomic characteristics. The SUBE is providing an
 analytical basis for subsidy reform schemes and is the tool by which the GoA will be able to implement it. SUBE has the

    sector, and the most significant multijurisdictional project taken-on in the transport sector in
    Argentina since the concessioning of the railways.

95. The project has also has had a significant capacity building impact. The project financed a
    flagship 18 month full-time comprehensive training program on urban transport for
    approximately 30 young professionals from the Transport Secretariat. These young
    professionals were trained by a group of faculty, including from the globally most well regarded
    graduate programs in the field across a wide range of technical and policy analysis and are currently
    supporting the Ministry during a 3-year period of post-training support. These young professionals
    will very likely form the core technical capacity in the sector in Argentina in the coming years. The
    program itself is being institutionalized and converted into a formal Master‟s degree program,
    supported by the follow-up Bank-financed project.

96. This achievement notwithstanding, some of the impact indicators targeted in the original
    project were not reached. Most importantly, despite the project‟s support to create a formal
    planning agency including its capacity for proper technical transport investment planning, the
    envisioned permanent multi-jurisdictional body was not created. Perhaps the project was too
    ambitious with regards to this target. The creation of a metropolitan agency is a highly political
    endeavor beyond the outputs of this project. Though creation of effective metropolitan transport
    agencies remains a critical element of the Bank‟s agenda across the region and elsewhere, in practice
    this has been a goal difficult to reach anywhere. Effective regional agencies have started becoming
    common in OECD settings only in the last two decades – and it is likely that the process to create
    effective agencies will take time. Nevertheless, it is worth highlighting that PLATAMBA is an
    adequate, fully staffed formal planning agency, which still requires decisions made at the policy
    level to reach multijurisdictional status, Two indicators were to be defined based on the results of the
    transport study, however, since the transport study was not completed at the time of the original
    loan, the indicators could not be quantified.20

97. It is important to note that the wording of PDO4 was not well aligned with the expected outputs and
    outcomes in the results framework, and fell short in articulating all institutional and capacity
    building achievements under it. Nevertheless, this PDO is still considered partially achieved.

   However, the indicators aimed to measure increases in public transport share of trips presumably as a result of enhanced
competitiveness of public transport; and an increase in the number of transfers, presumably a reflection of the higher
environmental quality of transfers. While the data do not exist to comment on whether the project directly resulted in a
material increase in public transport share or public transport transfers, the project undoubtedly increased the competitiveness
of public transport.

   In 1991, proposals were formulated to create a multi-jurisdictional entity to facilitate joint planning, regulation and control
of urban transport in the AMBA. Based on an agreement signed by the Mayor of Buenos Aires and the Minister of Economy,
a working group called Apoyo a la Creación de la Autoridad de Transporte del Area Metropolitana (Pre-ATAM) was created
to define and develop an autonomous Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (ATAM). The political environment, however,
was such that the bill to create the ATAM failed to be passed by the Argentine Congress. The Pre-ATAM by default assumed
some of the functions of the proposed ATAM, although with a much more limited mandate, and grew into a widely respected
entity of transport specialists. In 1996 it was converted into a Transport Planning Unit (TUAMBA) under the Ministry of
Economy and Public Works and Services (SOPyT) and through the Project Implementing Agency (UEP) became the
executing agency of the technical assistance component of the project

   Nevertheless, the creation of a multijurisdictional permanent body responsible for metropolitan transport policy remains a
key priority for the Government, and has been passed-on as one of four components of PTUMA project.

     99. Although no further indicators were established at the time of the approval of the Additional
         Financing Loan, the project supported and developed transport planning and urban transport projects
         with a common vision in other Metropolitan Areas – Rosario, Mendoza, Cordoba, Tucuman and
         Posadas. The achievement of this project in spearheading rational planning processes through
         extensive data collection, the preparation of transport models and subsequent consultation and
         definition of transport long term plans, can be considered a success. Although the timing to complete
         this rational planning process in the cities of the interior was underestimated at design, the fact that
         cities such as Rosario have already completed their long term plan, and that Cordoba, Posadas,
         Tucuman and Mendoza are well advanced in the process, are a sign that all will get there in the
         coming months. The success of this project and the continuation and expansion of these rational
         planning activities would become crucial in the preparation of the Urban Transport Project for
         Metropolitan Areas in Argentina (PTUMA) (P095485). In addition, the UEP has become the single
         agency within the GoA that can provide support in the preparation and supervision of planning tools
         including household transport surveys, transport for step models and integrated transport plans.

100. At the time of appraisal, an economic analysis was conducted to assess the rehabilitation of Line
A and the initially selected grade-separated crossings. In the case of Line A, the analysis conducted a
cost-benefit analysis of the entire concession process (under the assumption that without the Line A
rehabilitation – which was already a Government commitment in the concession process- the entire
process would be at risk) as well as a stand-alone assessment of the Line A rehabilitation by itself. The
analysis suggested large economic benefits (NPV >US$340m under a variety of scenarios) for the Line
A rehabilitation by itself and significant additional benefits related to preserving the concession. For the
purposes of the ICR, the cost-effectiveness of the Line A rehabilitation as a stand-alone project are
simulated, incorporating the increased costs and delays in implementation. The benefits are assumed to
remain unchanged from appraisal. This is a conservative/realistic assumption because key variables
driving the benefit calculations (the assumption regarding the timing of the collapse of the original
infrastructure – which did indeed collapse approximately 5 years after the project commenced, and
levels of traffic in 2010 are about the same as at appraisal) have been realized. The analysis suggests
that although the delays and cost increases lowered the efficiency of the Line A investments to a certain
extent, the investments remain efficient with NPV‟s over US$300m.

101. In the case of the grade-separated crossings, each crossing was justified on the basis of a
    standardized economic analysis conducted as part of the feasibility analysis on an ongoing analysis.
    In general the costs of the crossings and traffic volumes were in-line with the costs estimated during
    the feasibility study. Additionally, the data on safety outcomes clearly indicate the high impact of
    these relatively small investments. The efficiency of these crossings is rated adequate/Satisfactory.

                                                  Preface

This is a summary of the evaluation report of the project and works carried out following the execution
of Loans 4163-AR and 7442-AR.

The total cost of the original project was US$400 million, of which 50% was financed by the National
Government and the remaining 50% by IBRD through the Loan 4163-AR. This loan was approved
following Decree No. 1281/97 and signed on December 10, 1997. The Loan is closed as of the second
semester of 2012.

Due to positive results and for reasons external to the project, some activities were not able to be
completed and the IBRD approved an Additional Financing to the original loan.

The Additional Financing Loan allowed not only for the objectives of the project to be met but enabled
the carrying out of additional studies with the aim to expand acquired knowledge of the sector to
enhance the implementation of transport policy. The Additional Financing Loan in the amount of
US$100 million from the IBRD (Loan 7442-AR) and US$32.8 million from the National Treasury,
bringing total financing cost to US$132.8 million, contributed to finance costs related to (i) covering a
financing gap following the reallocation of resources to the social emergency program in 2002; (ii)
financing the execution of activities of the project modified as part of project restructuring; and (iii)
financing the execution of additional activities to expand the impact of the project and the effectiveness
of its development. The Loan was closed as of June 2011.

Among the project components, the following objectives were sought:

   1. Improvement of Road Safety.
       Works: grade separations – to reduce the number of accidents, reduce travel time, improve
         environmental quality, improve service reliability of the railway system in the Conurbano
         Bonaerense.
       Studies: improvement in grade separations, improve the system of barriers of at grade
         separations in the metropolitan area.

    2. Urban Transport System Integration.
Promote the integration in passenger transport through building the necessary infrastructure for transfers
between different modes of transport, train, buses, cars and bicycles. Revitalize the main areas of
railway stations, including:
                a. Transfer centers – used by a large number of passengers and which required
                    significant investment in infrastructure.
                b. Improvements in transfer areas to allow for improved transfer between modes of
                    transport, requiring moderate investments in infrastructure.


                                                     39
                  c. Improvements in the surroundings of the station which require fewer investments in
                     infrastructure.

     3. Improvements in Subway system. Modernization of Line A of the city of Buenos Aires.

     4. Urban Transport Planning for the AMBA. Preparation of studies related to Transport Planning in
        the AMBA.

COMPONENT A – Transport Integration

The overall objective of the project was the improvement in the mobility and safety conditions of the
population of the metropolitan area, particularly the low-income population. This would be done
through the planning, development and implementation of solutions to mitigate the main issues
regarding surface transportation affecting safety, costs, quality of urban living and the environment.

The lack of investments and planning had led to the deterioration of the railway system as well as the
surrounding area of railway stations, which turned into pockets of insecurity, poor use of public space all
of which are aggravated by significant disorder in general mobility and overall neglect. This project
contributed to the improvements in the surrounding areas of railway stations in the AMBA.

Improvements in the surroundings of railway stations in the AMBA.
This component aimed to: improve the capacity, efficiency, accessibility and service quality of
transport; to preserve public infrastructure; to increase property value in these zones; and to improve the
model of the city and of the landscape in the surroundings of the stations.

These works were geared towards the lower-income population who require modal transfers and
facilitated access to stations, whether for pedestrians, those with limited mobility or arriving on a bus,
car and bicycle. These works aimed to improve road safety.

Through a number of actions which included reconstruction of pedestrian sidewalks and surrounding
parks; paving of surrounding streets, especially those with deteriorated pavements; replacement of
shelters at station stops; ramps for disabled passengers; bike paths and racks; horizontal demarcation of
pedestrian paths and vertical signaling; lighting; pedestrian crossings; surrounding recreational area for
children, the project responded to the growing demand for public transportation, improving modal
integration in crucial centers of almost every municipality.

COMPONENT B – Traffic Safety / Grade separations

This component comprised of approximately 7 grade separations.23 The objective was to facilitate traffic
over the railway lines, improving the reliability and operation of the railroad, reducing traffic congestion
and accidents.

COMPONENT C – Line A Subway


23
  A total of 12 grade separations were completed by project closing date – a revised list of grade separations was received
from the Borrower in March 2012.


                                                             40
The signaling contract was fully executed and the works were completed. The replacement of galvanic
insulated joints, which had been carried out under the sub-contract were cancelled since the technical
requirements exceeded Metrovías‟ scope of contract. The supervision of the civil works was completed
as of June 2011. Ridership for Line A grew steadily since 2006.

COMPONENT D – Institutional Strengthening

This component aimed to strengthen the institutional side of the transport sector with the primary
objective of attaining continuous operation of a sustainable transport system in economic terms and in
environmental quality terms in the AMBA and in metropolitan cities of the interior. This component
included studies, technical assistance capacity building activities.

Technical Assistance and Studies in Transport Planning
This sub-component consisted of activities related to strengthening the capacity of transport planning in
the AMBA and in the formulation of an AMBA Transport Plan. 3 Consultancy contracts awarded for the
origin-destination survey for trips carried out in the AMBA were completed by June 2010, despite
numerous delays in two of the contracts. Most of the final reports are currently under revision. In
February 2009 a contract was signed which included the purchase, installation, implementation and
maintenance of automatic devices for transit data collection in the AMBA for a period of 18 months. In
March 2010, this contract was amended to include an additional 7 permanent counting posts using new
technology. The contract was finalized in December 2010.

Project Development Studies
            An ex-post impact evaluation study was undertaken to verify if all the works were carried
              out according to plan, including for economic evaluation, consultations with communities
              and environmental impact study. The new methodology for evaluation for the PTUBA
              project was applied, using real costs for works and the Internal Rate of Return for each of
              the evaluated projects. A baseline was defined which allows to evaluate the project and
              define the parameters which serve for future ex-post evaluations of future works. The
              contract was completed.
            An ex-post evaluation for the works carried out for Line A is under preparation, with the
              terms of reference being drafted and a call for proposals being launched to carry out this
              study for works completed in Line A.
            A study on the relationship between the national state and the cities of the interior on
              urban planning and urban transport seeks to quantify federal spending, analyze social,
              environmental, urban, economic, financial and institutional impacts as well as possible
              alternative scenarios with action plans for policy reformulation. This contract was
              completed in 2010.

Development of the Metropolitan Transport Agency
This component aimed to develop a Metropolitan Transport Agency for the AMBA. There was a clear
need for strengthening capacity in the fields of planning and urban transport regulation. The Capacity-
building Program in Planning, Regulation and Public Administration in Metropolitan Urban Transport
was launched. This program consisted in the training of 27 young professionals in public administration
of metropolitan urban transport. The professionals came from different fields, forming a
multidisciplinary group of economists, engineers, architects, geographers, political scientists, lawyers,


                                                   41
social scientists and industrial designers, among others. The curriculum focused on all aspects related to
planning, regulation and public administration in urban transport, especially transport systems, economy
of transport, transport planning, project formulation and evaluation, technology, geographical
information systems, legal, institutional and regulatory aspects, design and transit. This program was
completed and the young professionals are currently being incorporated into specific positions within
PLATAMBA and PTUBA.

To complement the above-mentioned program, a consultancy was carried out to provide technical
assistance to the SOPyT in the preparation, implementation and supervision of the capacity-building
program targeting young professionals and Government employees in charge of transport planning and
management. From 2008-2010, consultants assisted PLATAMBA in all areas inherent to the
development, execution and supervision of the project.

Studies and Technical Assistance to Provincial Cities
The PTUBA project financed a number of studies in Argentinean cities with metropolitan areas with the
aim to provide technical assistance and institutional strengthening to help these cities formulate
comprehensive planning strategies in urban planning, carry out studies on pre-investment and other
studies related to the transport sector to improve public transport systems. The cities of Rosario,
Córdoba, Posadas, Mendoza and Tucumán are participating in this component, whereby planning tools
to strengthen the administrative units in these cities are being developed which include the preparation
of surveys and modeling using information systems. The data collected and the tools developed will
allow for a more comprehensive urban transport management system. In addition, these studies will
define and analyze priority investments for projects in these cities.
     City of Córdoba: O-D Survey was completed in 2009. As of June 2011, reports on the modeling
        step were received and approved by PTUBA. Contract has been finalized.
     City of Rosario: The final report was received following the 2008 Mobility study for the
        metropolitan area of Rosario. This report has formed the basis of management of statistical data
        as a planning tool for other cities to use in the medium-term.
     City of Tucumán: contract for study is pending the submission of mobility survey.
     City of Posadas: Final report and contract have been finalized. A user satisfaction survey on the
        metropolitan integrated transport (SIT) was carried out between March 2008-May 2010 with a
        sample of 1,000 cases. The purpose of this survey was to investigate the user‟s overall
        perception, including the quality of SIT and to identify the most important issues related to the
        choice of using the SIT.
City of Mendoza: Study was completed which included study of modeling of transport system;
population and territory; spatial issues, public urban transport information, traffic and environmental
conditions, O-D household surveys. Contract and study were finalized.
