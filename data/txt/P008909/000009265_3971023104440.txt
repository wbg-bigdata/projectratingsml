PREFACE
This report reviews the performance under the Eleventh and Twelfth
industrial credit loans extended by the Bank to Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi
A.S. (TSKB). Loan 1078-TU for $65.0 million was signed on January 22, 1975
and was fully disbursed by June 30, 1980 after an eighteen months' extension
of the original closing date. Loan 1430-TU for $74.0 million was signed on
June 6, 1977 and was fully disbursed by December 31, 1981 after a six months'
extension of the original closing date.
The attached Project Completion Report was prepared by Bank staff
with the full cooperation of TSKB which provided most of the data and other
factual inputs during a supervision mission to Istanbul in May 1982. Comments
received from the Borrower are reproduced as Annexes 11 and 12.
The project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TURKEY - TURKIYE SINAI KALKINMA BANKASI A.S. (TSKB)
(LoANS 1078 AND 1430-TU)
HIGHLIGHTS
The major objectives of Loans 1078-TU (Eleventh) and 1430-TU
(Twelfth) were to direct TSKB's investment towards the Less Developed Regions
(LDRs) and Small and Medium Labor Intensive (SMLI) industries and to diversify
TSKB's local and foreign resource mobilization. Specific requirements were
incorporated in the Loan Agreement setting targets with a view to achieving
these objectives (para 2.04).
The objectives set for LDR and SMLI investment were achieved. Mainly
through its promotional efforts, TSKB increased substantially its overall
financing of projects in the LDRs during the five years 1975-78 and met or
exceeded the targets set for this sector under the two loans (para 2.05 and
2.11). TSKB exceeded the targets set for S1MLI investment by 20% for foreign
exchange investment but was about 20% short of the target set for local funds
(para 2.05 and 2.12). Bank requirements for investment in LDR and SNLI
projects brought about a major change in TSKB investment policy. In
retrospect, however, the agreed targets provided for too high a proportion of
TSKB's investment to be diverted in a short period of time into areas where,
at the time, TSKB and the Bank had limited experience of the problems
involved. This policy has exacerbated TSKB's arrears problems and weakened
its financial structure (paras 5.03 and 5.04).
TSKB implemented a series of actions to improve its mobilization of
funds from the international capital markets. The results of these efforts
fell short of the target set due to factors outside the control of TSKB (paras
2.05 and 2.06). Most major banks involved in Eurocurrency lending had either
committed their quotas for Turkey or felt uneasy about Turkey's extensive
short-term borrowing. The requirements in the Loan Agreements were
appropriate and the exercise was well worth the effort in exposing TSKB to
international capital markets; in addition to the funds secured during
1975-78, TSKB secured additional foreign exchange resources in later years
from the contacts made during this period. Full realization of the benefits
of TSKB's efforts to broaden its foreign exchange resources should be achieved
when Turkey's credit rating has been re-established.
The progress made in domestic resource mobilization was varied.
About 75% of the targets for bonds issue and capital funds were achieved under
loan 1078-TU and 80% of the bond issue and 345% of the targeted capital
increase were achieved under Loan 1430-TU but with a delay of six months. The
performance on co-financing with commercial banks was very satisfactory with
TSKB achieving about 230% of target (paras 2.05 and 2.07).



v
The lessons for future operations derived for the review of these
projects are: (i) the Bank should intensify its efforts to develop with the
Government a comprehensive strategy to integrate economic and project work
(para 2.08); and (ii) major changes in DFCs' investment policies should be
gradually introduced (para 5.04).



PROJECT COMIPLETION REPORT
TURKEY - TURKIYE SINAI KALKINMA BANKASI A.S. (TSKB)
(LOANS 1078 AND 1430-TU)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     TSKB was established in 1950 as a development finance company by a
group of Turkish commercial banks and insurance companies with the objective
of providing long-term financing for private sector manufacturing projects.
The Bank took a very active role in the formation of TSKB and has been closely
associated with its development since then, except for a break from 1954 to
1961. The Bank Group has been a major source of funds for TSKB (15 credits
and loans, totalling $532 million), the latest loan approved by the Bank to
TSKB being in February 1982. IFC has also been associated with TSKB's
development both as an investor and co-financier and at present holds 3Z of
TSKB's equity.
1.02     In addition to financing Turkish industrial projects through TSKB,
the Bank has made loans to Sinai Yatirim Kalkinma Bankasi (SYKE), another
private sector investment bank, and Devlet Yatirim Bankasi (DYB), a public
sector investment bank providing long-term finance for public sector
companies. The Bank has also made direct loans for large, publicly-controlled
manufacturing projects for steel, pulp and paper, fertilizer and textiles.
1.03     This project completion report (PCR) reviews the performance under
two Bank loans, Loan 1078-TI] approved in January 1975 and Loan 1430-TU
approved in May 1977, and is the third report covering the Bank's operations
with TSKB 1/. The Bank's operations in the industrial sector, including loans
to TSKB, have been reviewed by the Operations Evaluation Department in its
report entitled "Sector Operations Review: Industries and DFC's Programs in
Turkey" 2/. This PCR is based on detailed sub-project data provided by TSKB
together with their written comments on the loans' objectives.
The EconomY
1.04     During the period 1975 to 1981 when these two loans were being
utilized for investment, there was a gradual deterioration in Turkey's
economic conditions and in the investment climate. This was reflected in the
overall rate of investment which declined from 25Z of GDP in the mid-1970s to
20Z in 1981. Private sector manufacturing investment by 1981 was estimated by
the State Planning Organization (SPO) at 40Z of the levels reached several
years earlier. Growth momentum, which had been maintained at more than 7Z for

-2-
the first four years of the Third Plan (1973-1979) through rapid reserve
decumulation and heavy short-term borrowing, came to a halt in mid-1977. This
resulted in a sharp deterioration in creditworthiness, and the beginning of an
economic crisis that included a severe foreign exchange shortage which was
exacerbated by the rise in oil prices in 1979/80. Capacity utilization
estimated by the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce at about 80% in 1976 had dropped
to about 51X by 1980 because of shortages of imported raw materials and
spares, growing social unrest and strikes which in 1980 forced factory
shutdowns of 5-6 months in some industries.
1.05     The major policy reform package of January 1980 announced a shift to
greater reliance on market forces, on enhanced role for the private sector and
the need for export expansion. Together with subsequent implementing actions,
it provided for stabilization measures needed to place Turkey on a sounder
long-term growth path. These measures had severe consequences for investments
under construction or recently completed, however. By the end of 1979, the
Turkish Lira had depreciated more than 30Z vis-a-vis the US dollar and by more
than 20% vis-a-vis Turkey's major trading partners since the last major
devaluation in 1971. The January 1980 reform package corrected for this with
a major devaluation together with a policy to maintain a realistic exchange
rate. The exchange rate has been regularly adjusted since 1980 to take
account of domestic inflation which reached 107% during 1980, 37% in 1981 and
25% in 1982 as measured by the Wholesale Price Index. Firms which had
borrowed in foreign exchange faced substantial increase in debt service as a
result. Stabilization measures also included IMF-agreed ceilings on domestic
credit creation and the freeing of interest rates which by early 1981 had
become substantially positive in real terms. These measures were beginning to
succeed in curbing inflation by the end of 1980 but at the price of
contraction of local demand. As a result, average capacity utilization in
manufacturing remained low despite the ending of social unrest after September
1980, and the increasing availability of foreign exchange. Firms with
investment projects under construction found it increasingly difficult to
generate the necessary cash flow to service existing debt, provide working
capital and meet cost overruns, and TL credit was not available to meet their
requirements. Many projects were delayed as a result, further worsening the
firms' financial difficulties.
1.06     In summary, the economic crisis together with the measures taken to
correct that crisis and the concurrent social and labor unrest created serious
problems for investors. Project completions were widely delayed as a result
of strikes and lack of access to foreign exchange in the period 1977-80 with
resulting cost overruns during this period of high inflation. The
difficulties in securing local loan funds or equity exacerbated the problems.
Once underway, projects found themselves burdened with excessive, long-term
debt, high costs of short-term financing (except for preferential industries),
and limited earning power due to the collapse of the domestic market.
Private Sector Industry
1.07     In Turkey, the public sector predominates in large capital-intensive
ventures such as steel, petrochemicals, fertilizers, pulp and paper and
cement. The private sector, on the other hand, is dominant mostly in light



-3-
and non-process industries, i.e. fabricated metals, electrical and mechanical
machinery, glassware, rubber and plastic, wood products, food processing,
textiles and clothing, and is for the most part represented by small and
mediunrscale enterprises. The private sector accounts for about 40Z of total
manufacturing investment, 68Z of value added, 64% of employment in the
organized sector and 85X of manufactured exports.
1.08     Industrialization in Turkey traditionally has been viewed as an
instrument for achieving high rates of economic growth and greater
self-sufficiency. Until 1980, objectives such as export promotion and
employment generation were given less weight as these were viewed as the
natural outcome of a rapid industrialization effort. Private investment was
encouraged with generous incentives combined with high levels of protection
from imports. The protection system, composed of quotas (abolished in 1981)
import licensing and tariffs and reinforced up to 1980 by persistently
overvalued exchange rates, has led to inefficiencies in the private sector.
It has also been heavily biased against exports by (a) making domestic markets
more profitable than exports; (b) preventing the exploitation of economies of
scale; and (c) raising import prices through the protection of inefficient
supplying iudustries. This resulted in an extremely low growth of
manufactured exports of about 3% per annum during 1970-77. Total exports
constituted only 6% of GDP in 1978 compared to a 20% average for 55 middle
income developing countries. The comprehensive program instituted in January
1980 placed greater emphasis on the private sector to stimulate growth and
exports and stressed the role of market forces. The pattern of development in
the past made it extremely difficult for the private manufacturing sector to
adjust to the new policy initiatives.
Financial Setting
1.09     Strict control over the entire structure of interest rates was an
important facet of Turkey's monetary policy for many years. In general,
ceilings on interest rates were set below market equilibrium rates. There was
a significant fall in the demand for money in the second half of the 1970s
associated with a decline in real terms of bank credits from 1977 to 1980.
The decline was particularly noticeable in credit to the private sector which
fell from 58X of total credits in 1975 to 50X in 1980. The public sector was
financed mainly by the Central Bank, while the private sector was mainly
dependent on private commerc ial and development banks.  Commercial banks were
required to allocate 20% of their credit in the form of term-credit but a
substantial part of these funds was allocated to firms associated with the
banks. Private development banks are not allowed to accept deposits from the
public and so are dependent on equity contribution, commercial banks loans and
bond sales for local resources. The transaction tax on inter-bank
transactions and until 1980 the ceiling on interest rates made it unprofitable
for development banks to utilize loans and bond sales during the latter half
of the 1970s. This severely limited local funds available to development
banks, made it difficult for them to provide a complete financial package for
their clients and concentrated their lending on foreign exchange resources.
The security market is extremely limited in size and most private firms'
investments, therefore, are financed out of the entrepreneurs' own resources
or by short-term borrowing from the commercial banks which is rolled over on
maturity. TSKB's evolution in this environment is analysea in paragraph 2.07.

II. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE LOANS
2.01     In the early 1970s, given the growing importance of private sector
manufacturing in Turkey and the major issues that were to be addressed, an
intensive review of TSKB's past performance and future role was underway
between the Bank and TSKB which culminated in a special Bank Study in 1974.
This Study found that TSKB had unquestionably met most of the objectives which
were prominent in the minds of the those who established and supported the
institution in the past.  It had succeeded in establishing itself as a strong
professional inscitution, consistently profitable and well regarded by the
industrial and financial community. Its profitability, however, owed a good
deal to its privileged position as a purveyor of foreign exchange provided by
specialized agencies. TSKB's budiness was fairly representative of private
investment as a whole, with relatively heavy concentration in textile and
non-metallic minerals and roughly following the prevailing geographical
distribution. TSKB had succeeded in establishing a reputation for financial
soundness and technical compe:tence that met or exceeded the hoped for
standards of its sponsors. It: had introduced the diacipline of project
appraisal into the decision-making process for longer term investment and
built up a strong staff of engineers, financial analysts and economists.
2.02     The Study further evaluated TSKB's performance against key criteria
for development banks which placed emphasis on (i} acceptable economic
standards; (ii) promotion of "difficult" projects; and (iii) resource
mobilization through the development of domestic financial markets. Based on
this criteria, the Study found that TSIB's performance was mixed. About 502
of TSKB's projects met reasonable economic standarda, 25Z were probably
worthwhile uses of Turkey's economic resources and the balance appeared
distinctly doubtful in retrospect. TSKB's performance in promoting
"difficult" projects, such as projects in backward regions of Turkey,
export-oriented projects and projects put forward by less well established
firms was not easy to assess as the actual achievement was limited, but it was
difficult to evaluate whether this was due to unfavorable conditions beyond
TSKB's control or to a lack of full commitment on TSKB's part. In addition,
despite repeated encouragement from the Government and the Bank Group, TSKB
accomplished little in the way of geographical diversification until a system
of incentives was established. TSKB's contribution to capital market
development, while substantial, was nevertheless found to be short of what
might have been hoped for in establishing the initial groundwork for an
effective capital market. The fundamental changes required to develop a
capital market, however, were outside TSKB's control as they required major
changes in Government policy on interest rates and taxes (para. 1.09).
2.03     Resulting from discussion between the Bank and TSKB in the early
1970s and the recomnendation of the above Study, a new strategy for TSKB
evolved which broadened TSKB's role as a development bank. This new role put
emphasis on (i) the economic evaluation of projects; (ii) strengthening the
promotioral role for "difficult" projects; (iii) decentralization of
investments into the less developed regions (LDR); (iv) expanding investment
in small-to-medium-sized labor-intensive industries (SHLI); and 'v)
diversification of its mobilization of foreign exchange and domestic funds.



-5-
2.04     Implementation of the revised strategy was initiated under two
previous Bank loans made in the early seventies with emphasis on economic
evaluation of projects and strengthening of TSKB's promotional role. Loan
1078-TU (Eleventh) and 1430-TU (Twelfth) put emphasis on directing investment
towards projects in the LDR and SMLI projects and the diversification of
TSKB's resource mobilization. With this general objective in view, specific
requirements were agreed with TSKB and incorporated in the Loan Agreements.
These requirements limited TSKB's investments in the developed regions and set
targets for investment in LDR and SMLI and for resource mobilization. The
specific agreement reached with TSKB during negotiations of the loans were as
follows:
Loan 1078-TU
(i) To limit the amount of the loan used to finance each sub-project and
investment in areas other than underdeveloped areas to $1 million
equivalent plus 30% of the estimated foreign currency cost of the
Investment Project in excess of such amount (Loan Agreement, Section
3.02).
Cii) To take steps to (a) raise foreign currency resources in the
international capital markets; and (b) raise Lira resources in the
domestic capital market (Loan Agreement, Section 4.08). This
objective was further elaborated in a Supplemental Letter whereby
TSKB agreed (a) to raise in the international capital markets foreign
currency resources equivalent to $25 million already authorized by
the Government and all such other foreign currency resoures as
required to cover the foreign exchange costs of projects financed by
TSKB and estimated at $100 million; (b) to mobilize at least TL 1,100
million in the domestic market through issuance of bonds and
increasing TSKB's equity (60%), and commitments from commercial banks
(40Z).
(iii) To allocate about 50% of all of TSKB's resources to projects in the
underdeveloped regions cf Turkey in 1975 and 1976 (change made in
TSKB's Policy Statement).
Loan 1430-TU
(i)  SMLI Investment sub-projects to be financed out of the proceeds of
the Bank loan should exceed in total $15 million (Loan Agreement,
Section 2.02 (c)).
(ii) To allocate for lending to investment in SMLI projects in 1977 and
1978 not less than the following amounts: (a) $30 million equivalent
in foreign exchange (including sub-loans totalling at least $15
million); and (b) TL 500 million in domestic currency (Side Letter).
(iii) To allocate in 1977 and 1978; (a) at least 40% of its total resources
to less developed regions (LMDR); and (b) not more than 25% of its
total resources to the eight most developed provinces (the financing
of SMLI sub-projects to be included in this ceiling) (Side Letter).

million of Bank loan; and (b) TL 500 million in domestic
currency.
Actual: Approvals for SMLI sub-projects were $36 million in
foreign currency, including $12.8 million of Bank loan,
and TL 404 million in domestic currency.
2.06     Mobilization of Foreign Exchange.  In 1975-76, TSKB implemented a
series of actions to improve its mobilization of funds from the international
capital markets by approaching 22 commercial banks, 6 of which eventually
participated in the IFC syndication for $50 million. The limited success of
these efforts, $50 million compared to the $125 million target, underlines the
difficulties encountered. The mobilization program was hampered by the
overall shortage of long-term finauce during that period and the fact that
most major banks involved in Eurocurrency lending had either committed their
quotas for Turkey or felt uneasy about Turkey's extensive short-term
borrowings. During the fol-lowing two years 1977-78, TSKB mobilized $63
million compared to the target of $50 million. The overall foreign exchange
mobilization efforts, however, were disappointing as an IFC syndication and an
expected European Investment Bank (EIB) loan did not materialize for reasons
outside TSKB's control. Other resource mobilization efforts in the Middle
East were also unsuccessful despite repeated visits to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia
by TSKB's management. While the immediate results of these mobilization
efforts were disappointing due to the continuing deterioration of the Turkish
economy, the exercise did result in establishing contacts between TSKB's
senior staff and the international capital market which have been maintained
since. These contacts have resulted in TSKB's securing additional foreign
exchange resources in later years in the form of export credit lines and the
administration by TSKB of the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) line of equity
for Turkey. Full realization of TSKB's efforts during this period to broaden
its foreign exchange resources should be achieved when Turkey's credit rating
has been reestablished.
2.07     Mobilization of Domestic Resources.  The progress made on domestic
resource mobilization was also varied. About 75% of the targets for bonds and
capital funds were achieved in 1975-76. The performance on co-financing with
commercial banks was very satisfactory with TSKB achieving about 230X of
target. In the following two-year period, TSKB achieved 80% of the bond issue
target and 345% of the targeted capital increase but with a delay of six
months. The problems for TSKB in mobilization of domestic resources had been



-8-
a matter of concern during previous years and was particularly discussed
during the two negotiations. TSKB's main problem resulted from Government
control of interest rates. Domestic lending rates were set at 14Z in 1974
rising to 2O0 in 1979. These rates were 4-5% below the floating Lira rate
which TSKB had to pay on bonds during the period. The Government, however,
agreed to undertake a study of the financial sector in 1976 which was
completed in 1978. The targets set under the two loans and the previous Bank
loan for mobilization of local resources were stopgap measures which required
TSKB to subsidize local currency loans from its spread on foreign exchange
loans of 2-1/2%. During the period the net yield on TSKB's bonds became
increasingly uncompetitive compared to time deposits and Government bonds and
so TSKB had problems in meeting the targets agreed with the Bank under these
two loans. In addition, there was a limit to the amount of subsidy TSKB could
afford on local funds from its spread on foreign exchange, particularly as
TSKB was endeavoring to tap the international market where satisfactory
financial results were essential for successful entry. TSKB's limited access
to domestic resources was throughout the seventies the major issue affecting
its role and financial stability. It increased its vulnerability to the
foreign exchange risk borne by its clients, it prevented TSKB from "packaging"
properly financial plans for its projects and meeting its clients' needs for
working capital and equity funds. Lack of local currency has been one of the
serious problems facing TSKB in its efforts to rehabilitate its clients during
the last three years. This issue is currently under review with TSKB and the
authorities in the context of the Bank's Financial Sector Survey of November
1982.
2.08     During the 1970s the Turkish financial sector had fundamental
structural problems involving a financial system dominated by a commercial
banking sector which was small in size relative to GNP and Turkey's stage of
development and an extensive complex system of Government intervention in the
allocation of credit to sectors combined with Government controlled interest
rates. A review of the sector was undertaken by the Bank in conjunction with
the 1974 economic report and by a Government study completed in 1978 (para.
2.07). These reports, however, appear to have had very limited impact on the
country's strategy and policies or on the Bank's operations and the same
sector problems, except for exchange rate policy and negative interest
rates 1/, were identified during the Bank's Financial Sector Study in 1982.
The Bank did review the level of interest rates with the Government
representatives during negotiations with TSKB but no progress was made as the
Government did not consider it appropriate to discuss basic financial sector
policy in the context of loans to a private sector institution. Given the
importance that the financial sector organization played in the Government's
policy of directing low cost finance to the State Economic Enterprises and
other priority sectors, any change would have involved a major policy decision
from the Government. A dialogue with the Government at the macro level might
have been more appropriate instead of at the project level. The lack of
progress during the period 1974-80 in addressing the problems identified in
1/ A major change in the exchange rate and interest rate policies were
implemented in early 1981.

the financial sector illustrates the necessity for the Bank to develop with
the Government a comprehensive strategy to integrate economic and project work.
2.09     Project Promotion.  In 1972, an understanding was reached whereby
TSKB would set aside 25% of its spread on Bank sub-loans to finance project
promotion to identify and develop "new style" projects such as SMLI projects
and projects in LDRs. This arrangement was continued under the Eleventh and
Twelfth loans with 1% of the spread allocated for this purpose. TSKB
restructured its organization in 1974, established branch offices and set
quantitative targets for industrial investment to be promoted in the regions
to support its operations in LDRs. Promotional activities involved project
identification through priority sub-sector review (Annex 1), with branch
offices endeavoring to interest investors in project proposals; or
alternatively, feeding back tentative project ideas of investors to TSKB's new
Research Department for further development. Projects identified and promoted
in 1975 and 1976 accounted for over 25% and 33%, respectively, of TSKB's loan
and equity approval during the two years. A large majority of these projects
were located in the LDRs. A list of the projects promoted by TSKB during
1975-78 is in Annex 2. TSKB also assisted these inexperienced investors in
the selection of equipment and provided technical know-how and management
assistance to overcome implementation problems. In cases where TSKB
participated in the equity financing of these projects, their staff were
represented on the Board and provided management and technical assistance in
addition to their responsibilities as directors.
2.10     TSKB also gave high priority to financing projects of new enterprises
sponsored by widely-owned shareholders' groups. A substantial number of the
projects financed were located in LDRs and were funded by migrant workers
returning from abroad.  About 30% of TSKB's financing during the four years
1975-78 was provided to companies with a wide shareholder base.
2.11     Investment in LDRs.  Through its promotional efforts, TSKB raised its
overall financing of projects in the LDRs 1/ from about 10 of approvals in
1973 to 52% for the two years 1975-76, thus exceeding the 502 understanding
reached with the Bank. About 59% of the Bank loan (1078-TU) was also invested
in projects based in the LDRs. In 1977-78, TSKB allocated 39% of its total
resource to LDRs 2/ and 22% to the most developed provinces. The balance of
39% was invested in the semi-developed regions (Annex 3). Thus, due in large
part to its promotional efforts, TSKB met or exceeded the targets for
investment in LDRs set under the two loans.
2.12     Investment in SMLI.  During the four years 1973-76, TSKB's
investments in SMLI projects (defined as those with fixed assets of less than
TL 35 million and maximum investment per job of $17,000) averaged $12 million
covering about 30 projects per year. TSKB exceeded the target set under
11 Based on SPO definition of LDRs.
2/ The definition of LDR was refined and limited under loan 1430-TU and a
second group of semi-developed regions introduced.



- 10 -
Loan 1430-TU for SMLI by 20% for foreign exchange irnvestment (including $15
million of Bank funds) but fell about 20% short of the target for local
funds. Geographical location, investment costs and job created by SMLI
projects are in Annex 4. Thirty-two of the projects financed were in the
least developed areas and a further 20 in the semi-developed regions. New
projects accounted for 70 of the 85 projects assisted, while 15 were for
extension of existing facilities. The average investment per job in these
projects amounted to TL 281,400 (US$14,468).
2.13     During the second half of the seventies, in response to the Bank's
requirements, TSKB continued to make substantial progress in expanding its
role as a development bank through project promotion, and increased investment
in LDRs and SNLls. Towards the end of the decade, the Turkish economic crisis
developed and portfolio arrears became a serious problem for TSKB. The
problem was exacerbated by TSKB's expanded operation in the LDRs and SMLIs. A
strategy of gradually uaoving TSKB's investment into these sectors would in
retrospect have been more prudent (para 5.04).
III. SUB-PROJECTS FINANCED
3.01     A wide distribution of-projects by sector, borrowers and regions was
achieved under the two loans (Annexes 5 and 6).
Loan 1078-TU
3.02     Financing for 45 projects was provided under this $65 million line of
credit. The major sector investment was made in the forestry processing
industry with an aggregate investment of about $17 million or 26% of the
loan. This was followed by the electrical machinery sector with $10 million
or 16% of the loan. The balance of $21.5 million or 33% of the loan was
invested in 12 industrial sectors. About 15% of the Bank loan was invested in
export oriented projects, 35% in projects promoted by companies with a wide
shareholder base and 0.5% in SMLI projects. The regional 1/ distribution of
investments was as follows:
North West                42%
Central                   24X
South West                17%
East                      17%
100%
1/ The North West region comprises the four most developed provinces of
Istanbul, Sakarya, Kocaeli and Bursa; the remaining provinces are
classified as semi-developed regions.
The Central region comprises three most developed provinces of Ankara,
Adana and Icel; the remaining provinces are classified as less developed
regions.
The South West region comprises one most developed province of Izmir and
the remaining provinces are classified as semi-developed regions.
The entire East region is classified as less developed.



- 11 -
Loan 1430-TU
3.03     Financing was provided for 63 projects from this US$74 million line
of credit. About 242 of the loan ($17.5 million) was invested in the textile
sector followed by 11% for electrical machinery and 10% each for machinery and
transport vehicles. About 10% of the loan ($7.3 million) was invested in
export oriented projects, 18% ($13.4 million) in SZILI projects and 30% ($22.0
million) in projects promoted by firms with a wide shareholder base. The
regional distribution of investments was as follows:
North West                52%
Central                   21%
South West                16%
East                      11I
100%l
3.04     TSKB provided about 40% and 37% of the total funds required to
finance the projects under loans 1078-Tf and 1430-TU respectively. The number
of jobs created for the projects as of the end of 1981 was about 17,000,
compared to the appraisal estimate of about 20,000.  During the period when
the projects financed under these loans were being constructed the economic
position in Turkey deteriorated and inflation increased rapidly (para 1.04 -
1.06). This difficult economic environment affected the projects. Project
implementation was delayed on average by about 12 months compared to appraisal
estimates. These delays were due to labor strikes, shortage of funds (caused
by inflation and delays) and inexperienced management in charge of projects in
LDRs and SMLI projects. Capacity utilization by the end of 1981 was on
average 52% compared to a projected utilization of about 82%. This percentage
utilization for new projects, however, compares favorably with an overall
industrial capacity utilization of about 57% in 1981 and the fact that on
average project construction was delayed 12 months. In addition, actual
project cost exceeded projected cost by about 115%. Part of this cost overrun
is due to using average rates for conversion of foreign exchange to Lira.
However, the major part is due to the unprecedented inflation exacerbated by
delays in project completion.
3.05     Thirteen of the 108 projects financed under the Bank loan were not
completed in 1982 and one completed project was closed down. Five of the 108
projects were promoted by TSKB, eight are owaed by companies with a wide based
shareholding and nine are located in the less developed East and Central
regions. The major problems associated with these projects are difficulties
in securing additional equity and working capital to meet cost overruns caused
by the high level of inflation. In addition these companies did not have
access to commercial banks funds, as banks give priority in allocation of
funds to companies with whom they have had long-term relations. The
shareholders, many of whom are returned migrant workers, are unable to provide
the necessary funds. These companies also suffered from a lack of experienced
managers and found it difficult to attract and retain qualified managers to
assist in resolving their problems. Due to the widespread arrears problem
(paras 5.03 - 5.04), TSKB is also experiencing difficulties in providing these
projects with the intensive assistance necessary to complete and get projects
operating profitably.



- 12 -
3.06     Most of the sub-projects showed satisfactory projected economic rates
of return (ERR). An analysis of the ERR, calculated at appraisal, on the 54
sub-projects for which economic rates of return are shown (Annex 5) is as
follows:
Number of Projects           Economic Rate of Return
6                         less than 15%
35               less than 15% but more than 30%
13                        more than 30%
All sub-projects had a projected ERR greater than 10%.  Given the difficult
economic conditions prevailing in Turkey since 1979, it is doubtful if many of
the sub-projects have yet reached their full economic potential.
IV. OPERATIONS
Management and Organization
4.01     During the five year period 1975-79, the major change in TSKB's
management was the retirement in 1976 of the General Manager Mr. Resid Egeli,
who had been associated with TSKB for 24 years. Under his able leadership the
institution developed as one of the leading development finance institutions.
He was succeeded by Mr. Ozhan Eroguz, the present General Manager. No other
changes in top management took place during the period. During 1980, about 45
of TSKB's experienced staff (or 30% of professional staff) retired prior to
enactment of a national law which reduced substantially the gratuity payable
on retirement. This resulted in a decline of TSKB's former high level of
technical efficiency and made it difficult for TSKB to adjust to the new
economic environment. TSKB's inability to maintain the real salaries of its
staff also resulted in a drop in morale and some loss of staff because of
increasing competition from other private sector companies. Adjustments in
the Tax Law enacted at the end of 1980 has substantially resolved the salary
problem.
4.02     In order to achieve a better distribution of TSKB's operations and to
give greater emphasis to the regional character of its operations, TSKB
implemented a management reorganization in January 1978 . The four operating
Departments were consolidated into three area Departments (Western, Central
and Eastern Anatolia), each under the supervision of one Assistant General
Manager. Under this reorganization, the Planning and Budget Department, which
was established in 1975, prepared annual lending and investment programs and a
monitoring system based on the area organization. This reorganization proved
generally satisfactory in the initial year but with the rapid deterioration in
the economic situation in 1979 and the parallel deterioration in TSKB's
portfolio and the resulting changing investment pattern, TSKB's regional
organization structure proved inadequate. To resolve these problems, TSKB
decentralized its organization in November 1979. Further organizational
changes were implemented in January 1982 to strengthen TSKB's monitoring of
its portfolio and to provide assistance in financial restructuring to
borrowers with serious problems.



- 13 -
Operations
4.03     TSKB's approvals, commitments and disbursements from 1974 to 1978 are
shown in Annex 7. Total approvals and commitments increased from TL 1.0
billion and TLO.6 billion respectively in 1974- to TL 2.7 billion and TL2.0
billion by 1978. Foreign currency loans continue to be the principal part of
TSKB's operations, accounting, on an average, for about 75% of its total
approvals followed by local currency loans accounting for a further 14% and
equity investments for 11%. Both approvals and commitments in 1978 did not
exceed significantly the 1977 levels, which signifies a reduction in real
terms over the previous year. Foreign loan approvals for 1978 amounted to
US$83.7 million compared to US$95.5 million in 1977, i.e. a reduction of about
12% over the previous year.
4.04     The growth rate in 1976-77 and the reduction in 1978 reflects in
general the state of the economy but was strongly influenced by two other
factors: TSKB's availability of resources; and TSKB's targets for regional
investment and investment in SMLIs. The lack of foreign exchange funds in
1974 resulted in a 50% decrease in foreign exchange commitments in that year
compared to 1973. Only after receiving funds under Loan 1078-TU in 1975, was
TSKB able to-increase its foreign exchange loan commitments over the 1973.
level. A similar situation occurred in 1976 before the funds from Loan
1430-TU became available in 1977. The shortfall was caused as TSKB was unable
to raise the projected foreign exchange (para 2.05). The regional and SNLI
targets also affected TSKB's commitment level as there was a strong demand in
1977-78 for projects in the developed regions but TSKB was constrained by the
targets in meeting this demand. Of the 30 applications for new loans,
estimated at $65 million, rejected by TSKB in Western Anatolia during the
first 9 months of 1978, about $21 million were rejected because of their
location, and $26 million rejected because the companies were closely owned or
well established enterprises.
4.05     TSKB's increased assistance to projects in the less developed regions
and those promoted by widely-owned new enterprises is reflected in the
incre. se in the number of equity investments. Commitments for equity
investments increased from 14 in 1974 to an average of 28 per year during
1976-78. The average size of equity investments, which had reached TL 12.2
million in 1976, declined thereafter to about TL 6-8 million. The absence of
any marked increase in total volume of equity investments is attributed to the
fact that an increasing proportion of the investments were made in projects in
the less developed regions, which are smaller than those in the developed
regions. TSKB has played an important role in providing and mobilizing equity
funds for projects in these areas in recent years.
4.06     Textiles, food processing, machinery manufacture and forestry
products were the principal industrial sectors for TSKB's operations,
accounting respectively for 15.5%, 12.4%, 10.7% and 9.8% of TSKB's commitments
during 1975-1978 . The rest of TSKB's approvals were well distributed over
other sub-sectors with none of them accounting for more than 10% of the
approvals for the period. The largest subsectors in TSKB's total outstanding



- 14 -
loans and equity investments as of December 31, 1977, were as follows: 19.9%
in textiles, 14.2% in food and beverages, 8.3% in chemicals, 7.1% each in
metal products and forestry products.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01     The forecast accounts and audited accounts for TSKB for 1975-81 are
in Annexes 8 to 10. TSKB's net profit as a percentage of average net worth
increased from about 20% during 1975-77 to about 25% during 1978-80 and to 45%
in 1981. The increase in earning during 1978-80 resulted from the increased
level of operations and a Government decision increasing the interest rates
and TSKB's spread. Further improvements in TSKB's spread were effected in
1981.  Under the historical accounting system, TSKB's results were very
successful during the period. Net profit after tax increased from about TL 83
million in 1975 to TL 612 million in 1980 and TL 1,490 million in 1981.
During the 1975-80 period, TSKB's investment portfolio increased fourteen-fold
to TL 57,528 million.
5.02     Most of these increase were, however, the result of higher inflation
during the period (para 1.05). In US$ equivalent terms, TSKB net profits
increased from about $6.0 million in 1975 to $8.0 million in 1980 and $11.0
million in 1981. The portfolio increased in US dollars equivalent by about
one and a half times to $430 million during 1975-80. The increase in
portfolio in lira terms resulted from the terms of TSKB's onlending which
require that sub-borrowers carry the full foreign exchauge risk, with loans
being automatically revalued after each devaluation. In spite of TSKB's
profitability during the 1975-81 (para 5.01), a substantial erosion of TSKB
net equity in real terms occurred during this period due to inflation. The
insidious effects of inflation on TSKB net value are best illustrated by the
fact that TSKB was unable to maintain the Bank's 10.1 debt equity requirement
on its long term borrowing to finance a portfolio that increased one and a
half fold in US dollar equivalent, even though shareholders contributions to
new equity during the period was abut TL 2,800 million or fifteen times the
1975 paid-in share capital.
Portfolio Arrears
5.03     TSKB has a serious problem with arrears.  This problem first caused
concern in 1977. The situation continued to deteriorate through the 1980's.
The percentage portfolio affected by arrears increased from about 20% in 1977
to 28% in 1981 but fell marginally to 25% at the end of 1982. Arrears of more
than 3 months increased from 3% of total portfolio in 1977 to about 16% in
1981 and 20% at the end of 1982. The major cause of arrears has been the
deteriorating national economic situation, with the resulting inflation and
devaluation raising the foreign exchange exposure to unmanageable proportions,
substantial additional requirements for working capital, inability of project
promoters to mobilize additional finance, low capacity utilization and labor
unrest. TSKB's mangement resources have been over-extended in dealing with
companies in arrears. The Bank intensified its supervision efforts to assist
TSKB in dealing with this p- blem. As mentioned earlier, a reorganization of



- 15 -
TSKB was implemented in January 1982 with emphasis on dealing with the arrears
problems and a substantial financing package to enable TSKB to assist clients,
particularly those affected by the foreign exchange risk, has been established
by the Government and TSKB's shareholders in conjunction with the Bank-
financed Export-Oriented Industries Project (Report No. 3655-TU dated January
29, 1982).
5.04     TSKB's position during this difficult period was exacerbated as a
result of the major change in investment strategy introduced in the early
seventies. The projects in the less-developed regions, broadly owned or
"workers" companies and SMLI projects were affected more by the adverse
economic conditions than projects financed by well-established groups in the
developed area, due to the former's limited ability to raise additional
finance and inexperienced management. A review of TSKB's portfolio shows that
66% of the loans in Eastern Anatolia (least-developed region) and 70% of SHLI
sub-projects were in arrears. Analysis of Bank financed sub-projects also
confirms this point. While the major problem affecting TSKB's portfolio was
caused by the unprecedented economic and political crisis in Turkey of the
late-1970's which could not be anticipated at the time of appraisal of Loans
1078-TU and 1430-TU " this problem was exacerbated by the rapid diversification
of TSKB's investments into regional development and SMLI sub-projects. In
retrospect, the target of 50% investment in LDRs under Loan 1078-TU and 40% in
LDRs and not more than 25% and $30 million in SMLI projects under Loan 1430-TU
(para 2.04) involved investing too high a proportion of TSKB's investment in
areas where, at the time, TSKB and the Bank had little experience of the
problems involved. A strategy of gradually moving into this new field while
maintaining the major part of TSKB's portfolio in traditional investment would
have been more prudent, particularly as TSKB is a private sector company and
must maintain a strong portfolio to maintain the confidence of its
shareholders.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
6.01     The Bank's major objectives under Loans Nos. 1078-TU and 1430-TU were
(i) diversification of TSKB's sources of local and foreign funds with a view
to expanding the financial resources available to the private sector; and (ii)
directing investment towards LDR and SNLI projects to reduce the regional
disparities which were increasing at that time. These two objectives were
identified as priority areas in the Bank's economic work, particularly in the
1974 Economic Study.
6.02     The Economic Study reviewed in depth the problem of the Turkish
financial system including the lack of development of financial assets outside
the banking system, Government control of interest rates, the effects of the
transaction tax on inter-bank lending, Government allocation of credit and the
nonr-existence of a securities market. With the exception of Government
control of interest rates, which were freed in 1980, the financial sector in
Turkey continues to suffer from the problems identified in the 1973 economic
review. The Bank did review the interest rates policy issues with the
Government in conjunction with the TSKB loans but no progress was made in
resolving this matter. The review of the financial sector undertaken by the



- 16 -
Bank during the 1974 Economic Study and the Government in 1978 had little
impact in terms of institutional and policy changes and the conditions created
under the loans were stopgap measures dealing only with TSKB's immediate
problems. The lack of progress made during the period 1974-80 in addressing
the problems identified in the 1974 Economic Study as major obstacles to the
development of the financial sector in Turkey, illustrates the necessity for
the Bank to develop with the Government a strategy to integrate Bank sector
and project work and perhaps to identify more clearly than it had done during
this period the policy actions resulting from such a strategy.
6.03     The Bank's requirement for investment in LDR and SMLI projects did
ensure a major change in TSKB's investment policy. Export promotion, however,
was not identified as a priority area in the early 1970s as during the three
years 1971-73, a very substantial improvement in Turkey's current account
deficit was achieved due to a rapid increase in workers' remittances, tourist
receipts and exports resulting from the devaluation of the Lira in 1971.
Turkey"s' dcbt service in 1972 had fallen to 10% of exports compared to 24% in
1965. In retrospect, however, one could challenge perhaps this lack of
concern for exports, which might have been an item of higher priority in the
seventies than regional development.
6.04     TSKB implemented a series of actions to improve its mobilization of
funds from the international capital markets as required under the Loan
Agreements. Substantial progress was made in this area but the results
achieved were nevertheless disappointing as TSKB's efforts were negated by the
continuing deterioration of the Turkish economy. The loan requirements were
appropriate and the exercise was well worth the efforts expended in exposing
TSKB to international capital markets; in addition to the funds secured during
1975-78, TSKB secured additional foreign exchange rsources in later years in
the form of credit lines and export credits from the contacts made during this
exercise. Full realization of the benefits of TSKB's efforts under these
loans to broaden its foreign exchange resources should be achieved when
Turkey's credit rating has been reestablished.
6.05     The progress made in domestic resource mobilization was not
satisfactory. TSKB was unable to meet the bond issue targets due to the
negative spread. This was in part due to Government control of local interest
rates which remained in effect until the economic reforms introduced in 1980.
Performance on co-financing with commercial banks and in increasing TSKB's
capital was well in excess of the targets. Nevertheless, a broader approach
to resolving the Turkish financial sector problems might have been more
appropriate instead of stopgap measures to deal with TSKB's immediate
problems. The economic and political climate, however, do not appear to have
been appropriate for basic changes in the financial sector, and loans to TSKB,
a private sector institution, were not perhaps the ideal vehicle to negotiate
changes in financial policies with implications for public sector institutions.
6.06     TSKB's performance in meeting the investment targets under the two
loans for regional development and SMLI projects was very satisfactory. In
retrospect, however, the agreed targets provided for too high a proportion of



- 17 -
TSKB's investment to be diverted in a short period of time into areas where,
at the time, TSKB and the Bank had limited experience of the problems
involved. This major change in strategy has exacerbated TSKB's arrears
problem and weakened its financial structure. The exercise, however, has
resulted in substantial diversification of industries, which will provide a
base for further regional development when the current economic difficulties
have been resolved.
