REPORT AID RECONMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED ELEVENTH LOAN TO
TURKIYE SINAI KALKINMA BANIKASI A.S.
WITH GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
1.        I submit the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed
loan to Turkive Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi A.S. (TSKB) with the Guarantee of the
Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of US$65 million to help finance lend-
ing for industry. Amortization would conform substantially to the aggregate
of the amortization schedules applicable to the specific investment projects
financed out of the proceeds of the loan. The interest rate would be 8 per-
cent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report (316a-TU) entitled "The Economic Development of Turkey"
in five volumes dated April 22, 1974 was distributed to the Executive
Directors. An economic updating mission visited Turkey in November 1974 and
its report is currently being prepared. Country data sheets are attached
as Annex I.
3.        Following a decade of stability in Turkey, student disturbances and
unrest among workers appeared in 1970, accompanied by party disagreements,
and in March 1971 the armed forces obtained the resignation of the Government
and called for the formation of an "above-party" and reformist Government.
After a succession of short-term Governments, martial law was ended and in
October 1973 parliamentary elections were held. In a shift to the left of
center, the Republican People's Party (RPP) won a plurality and formed a
coalition government in January 1974 with the National Salvation Party. How-
ever, underlying differences in the basic orientation of the two parties,
coupled with disagreement over policy towards Cyprus, led to the collapse of
the coalition in mid-September. After two months, during which none of the
major parties were able to form a government, a new cabinet made up largely
of technicians and non-party Senators and headed by a neutral prime minister
was formed in mid-November 1974. While this Government failed to win par-
liamentary backing, it remains in power as a caretaker regime pending the
outcome of further efforts to resolve the political crisis.
4.        Growth in gross national product in the last decade was high and
continuous, averaging about 6.9 percent per year in the period 1962-72, with
industry, power, transport and construction the main growth sectors. This re-
flected the development strategy during the first and second five-year plans
(1963-72), which gave highest priority to industrialization. In 1972 GNP in-
creased by 7.6 percent, but growth dropped to only 5.5 percent in 1973, mainly
due to a decrease in agricultural production as a result of poor weather con-
ditions. Transport, communications and private sector services also recorded
low growth rates, although this was offset in part by high growth rates in



industry, trade and financial services. For 1974, preliminary estimates by
the government indicate a higher growth rate of around 8 percent.
5.        The balance of paymnents situation was characterized in 1967-70 by
increasing trade deficits, and a strict system of import controls which led
to shortages of essential imports and, consequently, to under-utilization of
production capacity. To alleviate balance of payments pressures, the official
exchange rate was changed in August 1970 from TL 9 to TL 15 per US$ and re-
vised to TL 14 in December 1971. The 1970 devaluation, together with associated
stabilization measures, rising world demand and prices and a rapid rise in
workers' remittances (from $140 amillion in 1969 to $740 million in 1972) helped
to improve the situation dramatically. This improvement continued in 1973,
with an inflow of $1.2 billion in workers remittances, and with exports in-
creasing by 49 percent and imports by 34 percent. The overall result in 1973
was a surplus in the current accounit and a gross increase in reserves over 1972
of $700 million.  The balance of payments position remained strong throughout
most of 19;4, with workers remittances increasing by 25 percent during the first
nine months of 1974 compared with the same period in 1973. But it has come
under increasing pressure during the fourth quarter, as the inflow of workers
re,mittances slowed down, accompanied by a widening trade gap which will approach
$2 billion by the end of 1974. Gross reserves, which stood at $2.2 billion in
August have declined to $1.8 billion in mid-November 1974. In May 1974, the
lira was revalued vis-a-vis the dollar to TL 13.50 per US$ while its previous
parity vis-a-vis other currencies was maintained. In September 1974, the
exchange rate per US$ was readjusted to TL 13.85.
6.        The budgetary situation in the last decade was dominated by the rela-
tively rapid growth of public expenditures. Tax revenues also grew rapidly,
but the increase was more than offset by the rise in current expenditures
and transfers.   As a result, the overall budget deficit increased and the
Treasury had growing recourse to the Central Bank for short-term advances and
other short-term borrowing. In 1972 and 1973, Central Bank financing of the
Treasury was reduced considerablv as a result of a strict control of current
expenditures and a sharp increase in the sale of Government bonds, but this
situation appears to have been reversed in 1974, because of a large increase
in expenditures, including funds for the Cvprus operation.
7.        While State Economic Enterprises (SEEs) have had consistently low
profits, necessitating increasing budgetary transfers to meet current and
investment needs, there are sharp differences among them, with railways and
coal being the major losers and manufacturing showing improving profits.
Reform of the SEEs - in organization, mranagement, executive and labor skills,
and pricing policies - remains cruciai, especially to prepare Turkish industry
ior competition from the EEC. Prices of SEE products were raised in 1971
and again in early 1974 to improve their financial situation. Measures agreed
upon in connection with Loan 893-TU have begun to lead to improvement in the
financial situation of the railways, and those in connection with Loan 957-TU
provide for establishment of a paper mill on a sound commercial basis.



-3-
8.        Inflationary pressures have been high in recent years, with whole-
sale prices increasing by 20 percent during 1973 and 17 percent from December
1973 to October 1974. However, the rate of price increases appears to have
slowed down somewhat in the second half of 1974. The inflation has been
fueled in large part by a growth in domestic liquidity which has averaged about
25 percent per year during 1970-72 and even higher since then. Other con-
tributing factors have included increased workers remittances, increases in
agricultural support prices, an increase in the minimum wage, and deficit
financing by the Central Bank. To ease this inflationary pressure, policy
should be directed towards restricting domestic liquidity without discouraging
investment and growth. While the Government has recently raised interest rates
to encourage private savings and term lending, additional revisions in the
lending rates would be advisable in view of the high inflation rate.
9.        Development strategy has emphasized the growth of output and labor
productivity rather than employment. As a result, the labor surplus, in-
cluding the estimated labor surplus in agriculture, rose from about 1 million
in 1962 to 1.6 million in 1972, i.e. about 10 percent of the labor force.
Emigration has so far greatly eased the pressure on employment. Between
1965 and 1972, net emigration amounted to about 400,000 and was expected to
be about 70,000 per year during the Third Plan period (1973-77). The Third
Plan continues the emphasis on investment in capital-intensive industries
and projects a growth in non-agricultural labor surplus by another 300,000
by 1977. With the added effect of a slowdown in Europe on employment of
Turkish workers (paragraph 13), unemployment should be a major concern of
economic policy. Speedy implementation of land reform and integrated rural
development programs would help to dampen migration from rural to urban areas.
In addition, labor intensive methods need special emphasis in the choice of
projects. However, even with these measures and faster growth than planned
in construction and services, urban unemployment is likelv to remain a serious
problem.
10.       The prospects for continued high economic growth are good.    The
Third Plan constitutes the first phase of a long-term strategy for the period
1973-95, the ultimate objective of which is to raise Turkish standards of living
to those of Italy in 1970 through rapid industrialization and decreasing
dependence on external resources. The Third Plan targets are an 8 percent
GDP growth rate, a 12.7 percent fixed investment growth rate, a marginal na-
tional savings ratio of 38 percent (compared with about 18 percent in the
Second Plan), commodity imports and export growth of 9.4 percent and 7.1 per-
cent respectively and a decline in gross inflows of official external assistance
to $130 million in 1977 (compared with over $300 million in 1972). Workers'
remittances are estimated in the Plan at $600 million at constant 1971 prices
in 1977.
11.       A detailed analysis of these targets is presented in the basic
economic report. The general conclusion is that, though the prospects for
a growth rate of 7 percent are good, the Plan projections seem to underes-
timate the difficulty of raising the savings level and balancing the external
accounts at a reduced level of external assistance.



- 4 -
12.       The Plan anticipates that two-thirds of the increase in national
savings will come from the public sector through large increases in both tax
revenues and in surpluses of the State Economic Enterprises (SEE's). Given
the past performance of SEEs and delays in implementing a general reform,
the expected rapid growth in their surpluses does not appear feasible. It
will also be difficult to raise tax revenues to the extent implied by the
Plan, but there is scope for a smaller increase if vigorous policies are
pursued, e.g., further improvements in tax administration and effective col-
lection now under way, widening the tax net to cover agricultural incomes,
increases in the rates of property taxation, introduction of a value-added
tax and liberalization of imports to offset tax losses due to import substi-
tution and reductions of custom duties under the EEC agreement. The problem
of domestic resource mobilization by the public sector is therefore likely
to remain a constraint in the growth of public investment, and, apart from
improved SEE performance, higher external borrowing and policies to increase
long-term domestic borrowing from the private sector would be necessary to
achieve the ambitious investment targets.
13.       On the external side, commodity imports and exports in 1973 were
above the level projected for 1977. Workers' remittances in 1972 were already
higher than the 1977 target and have continued to grow, although their future
was made uncertain by the decision of the Federal German Government in November
1973 to temporarily prohibit further entry of foreign workers from non-EEC
countries because of the consequences of the energy crisis. It remains to be
seen what course this policy will take over the longer run. Although exports,
particularly of industrial commodities, have shown continued growth in cur-
rent US dollars, they have actually declined in volume during 1974 as compared
to 1973. This has been due largely to increased domestic demand for exporta-
ble goods and the rise in prices of Turkish goods in the world market.
14.       At the end of 1973, total external debt outstanding and disbursed
was $2.8 billion, of which all but 3 percent is public or publicly guaranteed.
The share of the Bank Group in total debt outstanding was 12.1 percent in 1973
and is expected to rise. The average terms of new credits have been hardening
in recent years and this trend is expected to continue. Of the total gross
official external assistance of about $411 million in 1972, the Consortium
members provided an estimated $260 million. Of this about $105 million came
from the United State and $38 million from West Germany. As a result of in-
creased remittances and other foreign exchange earnings, and successive debt
reschedulings and other arrangements for debt relief, the debt service ratio
fell considerably from 24 percent in 1964 to 8.6 percent in 1973. and is
likely to remain at about this latter level in the medium-term. Ilowever, in
view of the uncertainties surrounding remittances and oil prices, Turkey should
continue to exercise great care in its external debt management, including
restraint in its resort to suppliers' credit financing.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
15.       During the lengthy period of chronic balance of payments difficul-
ties before the 1970 stabilization program and devaluation of the Turkish
lira, Bank lending was only intermittent. Since then, rapid improvement in
the balance of payments and in creditworthiness has made possible a large
increase and continuity in Bank/IDA lending, which in FY71, FY72, FY73 and
FY74 amounted to $114.0, $173.3, $175.0 and $228.0 million respectively.
In these four years nineteen lending operations were carried out, of which
five were in agriculture, six in industry (including DFCs), four in power
and the rest in urban development, transportation, and vocational education.
Agriculture accounted for 20 percent of the funds lent, industry and DFCs
over 30 percent and power about 20 percent. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of November 30,
1974, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects. Implementation of
projects in the private sector has been satisfactory; on the other hand,
projects in the public sector have been seriously affected by political insta-
bility and resulting administrative problems, and disbursements have been
much slower than expected. A comprehensive review of the problems besetting
these projects was undertaken with the Ecevit Government and will be resumed
as soon as conditions permit.
16.       In view of the sustained improvement in the balance of payments
situation, no further IDA lending is contemplated. Bank lending is mainly
directed in support of Turkish efforts to improve: (a) lagging public sector
saving through financial and management reform of the State Economic Enter-
prises( SEEs); (b) distribution of income and living standards in an economy
entering its second decade of roughly 7 percent yearly growth, through more
attention to employment in investment projects, more concerted rural develop-
ment efforts, and better urban planning; and (c) long-term capacity to earn
foreign exchange through diversification, especially promotion of industrial
exports and tourism.
17.       While the focus of Bank lending is on supporting the institutional
and structural changes noted above, continuation of recent levels of lending
is also important in view of the increase in projected capital import re-
quirements. As discussed in Part I, Turkey's Third Plan goals of an 8
percent growth rate and increasing competitiveness with the EEC in prepara-
tion for eventual full membership require further import liberalization
and higher external borrowing in the near term. Under contemplated lending,
the shares of IBRD/IDA in total debt outstanding and in total debt service
are likely to remain under 20 percent and 25 percent respectively through
the 1970's.
18.       In supporting the broad objectives of improved SEE performance,
better distribution of welfare, and diversification of external earning ca-
pacity outlined in paragraph 16 above, it is planned to continue concentrat-
ing the bulk of Bank lending (a) in industry (including mining and DFCs),



- 6 -
where financial and management strengthening of SEEs is the key task, and
(b) in agriculture, where rural development, employment, and institution
building are the main focus. This core of the program will be supplemented
by repeater loans for railways and selected loans for power (which also cen-
ter on financial reform of state enterprises), follow-up lending for urban
development in Istanbul and possibly in Izmir in support of the second ob-
jective, and by lending in tourism. Bank lending has thus far been geograph-
ically focused mainly in the Istanbul region, with emphasis on urban devel-
opment and industrial finance, and in the Cukurova region around Adana on
the southern coast, with emphasis on power, irrigation and fruit and vege-
tables. This pattern is likely to broaden in pursuit of the second objective,
with wider lending in the Anatolian plateau and eastern Turkey in response
to the Government's effort to widen the geographic base of development, dis-
courage too rapid urban migration, and improve the distribution of income.
The proposed loan would further encourage TSKB to broaden its private sources
of capital and to step up its efforts to finance private investment in the
poorer regions of Turkey.
19.       With regard to public sector reforms, past Bank lending for power
over the course of several years helped bring about a comprehensive reorgan-
ization of the power sector including the creation of the Turkish Electricity
Authority (TEK). The recent Bank loan for the Elbistan project (1023-TU)
continues Bank support for TEK's long-term reform objectives and establishes
a working relationship with the Turkish Coal Authority (TKI) in the coal
mining sector. A further loan to TEK for transmission lines as a follow-up
to Loans 763-TU and 1023-TU is being prepared for FY 1975. A second loan to
IGSAS (Istanbul Fertilizer Company) is also being prepared for FY 1975 to help
finance an enlargement of the project financed under Loan 845-TU (cfr. Annex
II, page 6). The Antalya Forest Loan (957-TU) aims to strengthen the State
Pulp and Paper Enterprise (SEKA) in its overall investment planning as well
as to promote effective financial management in the new mill subsidiary at
Antalya. In addition, the industrial credit loan to the State Investment
Bank (DYB) (1024-TU), the Government's main lending institution for public
sector enterprises, aims to strengthen DYB's role in financing small- and
medium-sized SEE industrial projects. The Bank is also involved in the mo-
dernization of the Railways (893-TU) and in the iron and steel industry with
its loan for Erdemir Steel Expansion (817-TU).
20.       The Bank's main effort in support of the objective of better income
distribution is the twin strategy of promoting rural alternatives to urban
migration and improving urban development. As a beginning in rural develop-
ment, the Bank approved a credit in FY72 for the Second Livestock Project,
which focuses on fodder cropping and breeding, raising and fattening of
animals in Eastern and Central Anatolia. For FY75 the Government is preparing
an integrated Rural Development Project in rainfed areas of central Turkey and
for FY76 a project for agricultural credit and agro-industries which is plan-
ned to include a component for supervised farm credit. The Forestry part of
the Antalya Forest Utilization Project should also make a significant contri-
bution to rural employment through expanded cutting, reforestation and af-
forestation. Future lending for forest village development is also contem-
plated. In urban development the Bank lent for Istanbul Water Supply and
Urban Studies in 1Y72 and for Istanbul power distribution in FY73. An urban



- 7 -
transport bus project is being prepared for FY75 or early FY76; and further
infrastructure lending in support of better planning and coordination of
development in Greater Istanbul and possibly in other cities is anticipated,
should the institutional objectives underpinning earlier projects in Istanbul
be satisfactorily attained.
21.       The objective of diversification of capacity to earn foreign ex-
change has been supported in the past with the Fruit and Vegetables project,
which is aimed mainly at production and processing for export to Europe. The
proposed project, while focused heavily on investment in Turkey's underdevelop-
ed areas, will also enable TSKB to continue its encouragement of investment
in export industries. For the future, the agro-industries component of the
Agricultural Credit Project will be export-oriented, and the Government is
preparing a Tourism Infrastructure Project on the Mediterranean coast west of
Antalya.
22.       As a result of some leveling off of bilateral aid, the European In-
vestment Bank (EIB) has become, along with the Bank, Turkey's major source of
external finance on noncommercial terms. The Bank has developed informal
cooperation with EIB in the past, for example, in related but not formally
parallel lending in FY 1973 to the Turkish Railways and to TSKB. Both the
Antalya Forest Utilization Loan and the loan for the Elbistan Lignite Power
Project represent further steps toward formal joint financing with EIB, and
we anticipate continued close association in other future large-scale projects
as appropriate. The Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) has also become an
important source for financing on non-commercial terms and is closely associat-
ed with several Bank projects, especially Elbistan for which it is a major
co-financer, and in lending to TSKB.
23.       The Railways and Antalya Forest Utilization Project also exemplify
the Bank's continuing collaboration with UNDP. In both projects UNDP financed
the feasibility study undertaken with the help of outside consultants, for
which the Bank acted as executing agency. In addition, UNDP is financing
further railway technical assistance studies which form an integral part of
the implementation of the project. In 1973 UNDP financed a study of forest
industries in the Marmara region of Turkey to help define a larger study
recommended for inclusion in the Antalya Forest Utilization Project. The
Bank is also collaborating with the UNDP in the preparation of the tourism
project, with UNDP and FAO in the preparation of the Rural Development Project
noted above, and cooperation is anticipated on other projects in the future.
24.       IFC has been active in Turkey, having participated in investments
for nylon yarn, pulp and paper, glass, aluminum, steel pipe, and tourism.
Total commitments so far amount to about $71 million. IFC is currently in-
vestigating new investment opportunities in various sectors, including tex-
tiles, and synthetic fibers.



- 8 -
PART III - INDUSTRY IN TURKEY
25.       Turkish industry has grown rapidly during the past 15 years, aver-
aging 10.5 percent per year during the First Plan (1963-1967), 9.8 percent
during the Second Plan (1968-1972), and an estimated 15 percent in 1973. The
First, Second and Third Five Year Plans have all aimed at rapid industrializa-
tion as the basis for sustained economic growth, to absorb surplus manpower
and to reduce the need for foreign aid. The investment priorities in the
Second Plan were chemicals and petroleum refining, steel and other metals,
mechanical and electrical equipment and consumer goods. The Third Plan places
a comparatively greater emphasis on investment goods. The long-term aim is to
accelerate the transformation of Turkey's industrial structure in preparation
for full association with the EEC in 1995. Under the Plan this means estab-
lishing intermediate and investment goods industries in the shortest possible
time to permit the application of advanced technology, the development of a
more diversified industrial structure, and the production of a wide range of
industrial exports.
26.       Although traditional consumer goods industries remain important,
modern industries such as basic metals, metal products, machinery, chemicals
and petroleum products now constitute over 40 percent of manufacturing produc-
tion. Along with the growing sophistication and diversity of the sector,
industry has absorbed a growing portion of the nation's resources as the num-
ber and size of the projects have increased in both the State and private
sectors. The share of manufacturing in total gross investment rose from 24
percent in 1962 to near 30 percent in 1972. However, the growth of output
and investment in industry has been accompanied by a high capital-output ratio
and a slow growth of employment. Employment in industry increased to about
11 percent of total employment in 1972 compared to 8 percent in 1962.
27.       Modern Turkey has developed as a mixed economy since the early days
of the Republic and the State Economic Enterprises (SEE's) have become the
principal mechanism for managing public sector economic activity. In the
productive sector, SEE's dominate electricity, petroleum refining, steel,
nitrogen, paper, rail and air transport, shipping and communications, and
play an important role in textiles, cement, coal, sugar, machinery, and
chemicals. SEE's are also important in finance, and hybrid organizations
like Etibank in mining and Sumerbank in textiles, ceramics, etc., act as
holding companies and as lenders for their operating subsidiary "establish-
ments". The Agricultural Bank and the State Investment Bank (DYB) are SEE's
created to finance SEE investments generally in agriculture and industry.
While the primary purpose of SEE's is production and finance, they have
also been charged with various social goals such as development of backward
regiors, absorption of manpower, and maintenance of price stability, which
have tended to become a hidden financial burden. Although some have shown
good operational results, their overall financial performance has been poor.
28.       About 40 percent of the value added in manufacturing industry
comes from the public sector, which has a virtual monopoly in steel, petro-
leum refining, fertilizers, petro-chemicals, pulp and paper. It has also ac-
counted for about 55 percent of industrial investment during 1963-72. As a



-9-
general rule, the public sector enters fields considered of vital importance
or where the private sector is unwilling to invest, either because of shortage
of financing capacity or because of low financial return.
29.       In the private sector, high rates of protection coupled with invest-
ment incentives have encouraged investment in food, textiles, chemicals,
cement, non-metallic products, metals, machinery and vehicles. In current
prices, private industrial investment increased from TL 6.5 billion in 1972
to an estimated TL 10.9 billion in 1973, or about 65 percent of total invest-
nient, whereas public investment in manufacturing remained constant.
30.       About two-thirds of private fixed investment in manufacturing is
financed by internally generated funds of the companies and the unorganized
money market. Long-term loans from TSKB and the Industrial Development and
Credit Bank (SYKB) account for 10-12 percent, foreign direct investment and
suppliers' credits 10-15 percent, commercial banks 6-8 percent, and corporate
bonds 3-5 percent. In 1973, TSKB's disbursements corresponded to about 9
percent of the total of private fixed investments, and TSKB provided about 18
percent of the financing for private investment using foreign exchange.
31.       Apart from Government bonds, whose market is confined largely to
social security organizations and other financial institutions which are re-
quired to hold them, the only long-term fixed interest financial instrument
available in Turkey is the corporate bond. This is a relatively new instru-
ment which began to be significant in 1968 when TSKB took the lead in guaran-
teeing such bonds. Nevertheless, the corporate bond market remains fairly
thin and TSKB itself only began to issue bonds in 1973. Growth of this market
has been impeded by the attractiveness of Government bonds (they are tax-free
and redeemable at par after one-year), the ceiling on interest rates, the
worsening of inflation and tight money policy. As a result, the public has
shifted to higher yielding securities or shares in holding companies and other
companies. Nevertheless, the market for corporate stock also remains limited,
with most of the capital of joint stock companies still controlled by families
or by a small number of shareholders, and most new capital is still being
raised from existing owners. In December 1974 the interest rate paid on bonds
was increased from 15 to 18 percent, a step which will improve the attractive-
ness of bonds to investors. The need for other measures to stimulate the
mobilization of long-term capital in the capital market is widely recognized
and legislation has been under consideration by the Government for some time.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.       A detailed description of the proposed project is;'iven in the
report entitled "Appraisal of Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi, A.S., Turkey;
Report No. 529a-TU, dated December 20, 1974, which is being distributed sepa-
rately. A Loan and Project Summary is attached as Annex III.
33.       The proposed project was appraised during a mission to Turkey in
May and June 1974. Negotiations took place in Washington in November. The



- 10 -
Government was represented by Mr. Muammer Akinci, Chief Counselor for Finan-
cial and Economic Affairs of the Turkish Embassy and TSKB by Mr. Ozhan Eroguz,
Senior Assistant General Manager.

34.       Established in 1950, TSKB is the oldest client among the Develop-
ment Finance Companies associated with the Bank Group. It is also one of the
first clients of IFC which became a shareholder in 1963. From its founding
to March 31, 1974, TSKB obtained about TL 5.0 billion (about $352 million)
for financing of Turkish industry, of which 80.6 percent was in foreign ex-
change. Six Bank Loans and four IDA Credits together with one IFC loan and
four IFC investments contributed $180 million in foreign exchange or 51 percent
of TSKB's overall resources in this period. The current Bank Loan (873-TU) is
now almost fully committed. TSKB is an efficient development finance company
with an extremely competent appraisal staff and no internal managerial prob-
lems. Its major contribution to Turkey's industrial development effort has
been its role in channeling funds to private industry on the basis of a care-
ful appraisal process.
Capital Structure and Finances
35.       As of March 31, 1974, TSKB's total assets amounted to TL 3.4 billion
(about $242.0 million), of which the loan and equity portfolios represented
81 percent and 5 percent respectively and liquid funds 8 percent. The Govern-
ment has been the principal source of domestic resources, having provided
eight loans representing about 51 percent of local currency resources outstand-
ing. Since a share capital increase in 1972, there has been no major change
in the structure of ownership. The ownership is broadly representative of the
Turkish financial community: -The major commercial bank, Turkiye Is Bankasi,
is the largest shareholder, holding 20.8 percent of the shares; eleven other
Turkish private institutions own an additional 39.1 percent. Foreign insti-
tutions, of which IFC is the most important, own 10.8 percent. In addition
to the Bank Group, which accounts for 64 percent of TSKB's outstanding foreign
debt, foreign exchange funds have been provided by the European Investment
Bank (18 percent), Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (14 percent) and USAID (4
percent).
36.       TSKB's profits and overall financial standing remain excellent.
Its 1973 profits after taxes and provisions were 42 percent above 1972 and
yielded 21 percent of average net worth as compared with 18 percent in 1972.
TSKB also paid a 15 percent dividend in 1972 and 1973, which was about 44
percent of its net profit for each year.
Operating Policies and Procedures
37.       TSKB's policy guidelines set limits for exposure in its loans and
investments, restrict the use of foreign exchange to imports, and provide
for analysis of the merits and feasibility of projects. Since 1968, TSKB has
been making assessments of the economic impact of its projects and in 1970
it began employing effective rate-of-protection calculations. Beginning in



January 1974, TSKU has been calculating the economic rate of return on all
new or expansion projects of relatively large size.
38.       Until the early 1970's 80 percent of TSKB's lending was concentrated
in the Marmara region around Istanbul. However, in the last two years, the
geographical distribution has been broadened and TSKB has assumed a more active
developmental role. With support from the Bank's last loan, a Promotion
Program in the underdeveloped regions was launched. In October 1973 new
policy guidelines were laid down. These guidelines focus on the following:
the promotion of investment in less developed regions and assistance in project
identification, preparation and financing; the analysis of project related
sector and sub-sector development and preparation of investment estimates for
these sectors; and the extension of the lending program to include tourism
and services. Lending to the underdeveloped regions increased significantly
in 1974, and TSKB is planning to allocate about 50 percent of its total lend-
ing in the underdeveloped regions in the next two years. TSKB has also under-
taken to allocate not less than 50 percent of the proceeds of the loan to
finance projects in these areas.
Management and Organization
39.       In line with these new policy guidelines, TSKB's organizational
structure underwent a major change at the beginning of 1974, when operations
were divided into four regions--northwestern, southwestern, central and
eastern Anatolia--, with each region headed by a departmental manager respons-
ible for planning and investment program execution. To reinforce this struc-
ture, TSKB now has four regional branch offices. TSKB's main Istanbul office
has also been strengthened with the establishment of three new assistant
general manager positions to supervise resources, accounting and disbursements;
research; and loans and investment. TSKB's staff is capable and experienced,
with staff turnover at a low level. At present the staff totals 265, includ-
ing 38 managers and 78 professionals.
40.       TSKB's nine-member Board of Directors is active; it meets twice a
month and considers all applications above $50,000 equivalent. Although the
Board is still generally conservative in its orientation, it has fully sup-
ported the management's efforts to redirect operations more toward the under-
developed regions of the country, to accept the risks inherent in more active
participation in development, and to seek to raise a larger share of TSKB's
resources in the capital markets.
Lending Operations and Finances
41.       TSKB'p foreign exchange lending in the past few years has increased
substantially, with its lendirin for 1973 on a commitment basis more than four
times the level of 1971. Nevertheless, because of difficulties in adequately
replenishing its resources (para. 47), TSKB's volume of business dropped
sharply during the first 8 months of 1974 compared with 1973. Foreign cur-
rency loan commitments in January-August 1974 amounted to $28.8 million com-
pared with $59.3 million for the entire year 1973, a decline of 27 percent
on an annual basis. Local currency loan commitments showed a much sharper



- 12 -
drop of 55 percent, with commitments falling from TL 155.6 million in 1973 to
TL 46.8 million in the first eight months of 1974. Equity investments re-
mained at about the same level with 50.8 million for all of 1973 and TL 53.6
million for the period January-August 1974.
42.       Before the Government raised the permissible ceiling on interest
rates from 12 to 14 percent effective October 1, 1974, both foreign and local
currency loans were lent at the maximum rate of 12 percent, which meant that
after a 25 percent tax TSKB's borrowers were paying 15 percent. With the
change in interest rates, this cost is now over 17 percent. Borrowers also
assume the foreign exchange risk on foreign currency loans.   Average terms are
about 6 to 7 vears on Turkish lira loans and 9 to 12 years on foreign currency
loans. The average size of the loans has continued to increase, rising from
TL 4.8 million in 1970 to TL 11.7 million in 1973. The lending portfolio is
well diversified among various industries.
43.       As of December 31, 1972, the total principal and interest in arrears
over three months stood at TL 145.1 million or some 7.7 percent of the loan
portfolio. By March 31, 1974, the total outstanding for over three months had
increased to TL 276.2 million or about 10 percent of the loan portfolio.
Nevertheless, although the arrears situation has gradually worsened during
the past two years, TSKB's portfolio remains sound as loans in arrears are
well covered by collateral and provisions for losses are adequate. The rigid-
ity of the interest rate is a contributing factor in loan delinquency since
TSKB, like othler financial institutions, cannot charge penalty rates on new
loans because it is already lending at the maximum allowable rate of interest.
44.       TSKB also makes direct investments in the industrial sector, al-
though its equity participation represents only about six percent of its
total portfolio. TSKB plans to expand its equity investments, particularly
in the underdeveloped regions where its participation acts as a strong in-
ducement to other potential shareholders. In September 1973 the maximum
limit of its equity investment was raised from TI. 175 million to the level
of its paid-in share canital and reserves which amounted to TL 376 million
as of December 31, 1973. In addition to its equity investments, TSKB has
also undertaken a program of joint financing with commercial banks and ex-
pects to expand such operations considerably over the next two years.
Projected Operations and Resource Mobilization
45.       Over the next five years (1975-1979) TSKB expects to reach an over-
all commitment level of TL 16.0 billion which is more than four times the
level of the previous five-year period.   To meet this projected level of
lending and investment, an estimated TL 11.9 billion ($850 million) ih foreign
exchange and 4.1 billion in Turkish lira would be required. Of the total for-
eign exchange requirement, an estimated $300 million would be needed for the
period September 1974 to December 1976. The available or anticipated re-
sources to meet this need include new loans from EIB and iKfW totalling $36
million which became effective in the second half of 1974. In addition, TSKB
will apply for further loans from KfW and EIB for the period 1975 to 1976
hind hopes thiey will total about $66 million.  This leaves an overall foreign



- 13 -
exchlange gap of about US$200 million equivalent for the September 1974 to
December 1976 period.   The proposed Bank loan would cover less than a third
of this gap up to the end of 1976, thus requiring TSKB to amplify considerably
its foreign resource mobilization eflcrts.
46.        TSKB's local currency commitments for the September 1974 to Decem-
ber 1976 period are expected to reach TL 1.5 billion. This amount would be
obtained in part from internal cash generation (estimated at TL 825 million
for the period) and by increases in share capital (TL 125 million). The re-
naining lira resource gap will be met by additional bond issues which TSKB
has undertaken to float, at a negative spread if necessary, during the next
two years (TL 200 million in 1975 and TL 350 million in 1976).
47.       A major obstacle TSKB faces in raising funds on the domestic market
is the 14 percent ceiling on lending rates set by the Government which is
below the effective cost of medium- and long-term funds in Turkey. Because
of this TSKB has had to borrow local currency at a negative spread, this being
offset by large positive spreads on other borrowing. While this is an accept-
nble temporary solution, it is not a viable long-term answer to TSKB's resource
problem. If further changes in the lending rate are not forthcoming in sub-
sequent years, TSKB's profitability would decline below optimum levels. How-
ever, during the next two years, TSKB's continued borrowing at a negative
spread will reduce, but not seriously affect its overall profitability.
48.        In recognition of this problem, TSKB, as recorded in Section 4.08 of
the Loan Agreement, has agreed to mobilize resources in both the domestic and
foreign capital markets. For the period 1975-76, TSKB has indicated its in-
tention to endeavor to raise TL 1,100 million in the domestic market, of which
at least 60 percent would be obtained through bond issues and share capital
contributions, and substantial amounts of foreign exchange in the international
capital market, assuming circumstances permit, in addition to $25 million
already authorized by the Government.
Spread on Relending Borrowed Funds
49.       As agreed with the Bank under the previous loan, TSKB has been
assigning 25 percent of the 4-3/4 percent spread to a Special Promotional
Account for the underdeveloped regions. Although delays have occurred in
making use of these funds, the program is now underwav and will become an
increasingly important resource for project identification and other develop-
ment tasks in the underdeveloped regions. The funds allocated under the last
loan for the promotional funds are sufficient to meet the needs of the program
for the coming two years and tihe proposed loan does not provide for further
contributions to the promotional accour.t.   With the -ncrease ir. len.ding rate
to 14 percent, however, the spread earned on Bank funds will increase to 6
percent. To conform to the spread earned on resources obtained from KfW and
FIB, agreement has been reached to limit TSKB's net spread under the proposed
Bank loan to 2-1/2 percent with the balance to be paid to the Government as
a guarantee fee.

Financial Covenants
50.       The proposed loan will have the usual terms for DFC operations in-
cluding the standard commitment charge. Since it is expected that the aver-
age size of the subprojects in the underdeveloped regions will be smaller
than in the developed areas, and since Bank funds will be used to finance
only part of the foreign exchange needs for projects in the developed regions,
no change is needed in the present free limit of US$1 million. The Loan
Agreemient provides that TSKB will be able to use 30 percent of the proposed
loan amount to finance projects below the free limit. The debt/equity ratio
as defined in the Loan Agreement will increase from 4.4:1 in 1974 to 6.4:1 in
1976 and lo 9.7:1 in 1979. Because the quality of TSKB's portfolio is sound
and covered by good guarantees, with losses adequately provided for, TSKB's
present debt equity limit of 5 to 1 should be raised to 6 to 1. To avoid
exceeding this limit by 1976, however, TSKB is prepared to increase its share
capital in 1976 rather than 1977 as presently scheduled, and, if needed, to
consider additional measures in consultation with the Bank.
Economaic Benefits
51.       In recent years TSKB has increased its support of export-oriented
projects and this trend is expected to continue. Actual exports of its
borrowers increased from about $45 million in 1971 to $112 million in 1973.
The number of new jobs created each year by TSKB-financed projects has also
increased from an average of 3,500 to 4,000 during 1970 and 1971; to 7,000 in
1972 and 7,300 in 1973.
52.       TSKB is an effective and important institution which has contributed
substantially to the growth of private industry in Turkey and is now strength-
ening its role in the underdeveloped areas of Turkey. It has demonstrated its
ability to use capital effectively.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.       The draft Loan Agreement between TSKB and the Bank, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and the Bank, the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles
of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed separately to the Executive Directors. The draft agree-
ments conform to the normal pattern for loans for development finance com-
panies.
54.       1 am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
55.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Loan
and Guarantee Agreements.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -/
Ln. and Cr. Nos. 587/143 Second Seyhan Irrigation Project: US$12 million
Loan and US$12 million Credit of February 20. 1969. Closing Date: June 30,
1975.
Work on Stage II of the Seyhan Irrigation Project is being perform-
ed in a satisfactory manner and no serious problems are being encountered.
There has been a slight delay in progress due (i) to the need to terminate
and readvertise several small civil works contracts due to issuance of a
Government decree to protect contractors from financial distress from inflat-
ing costs on contracts with no price escalation provisions; and (ii) delays
in on-farm development caused by the failure of farmers to make lands avail-
able because of interference with production of high value cotton crops. The
Government has not yet granted permission for the use of loan/credit funds
available for technical training or project personnel. Government has been
urged to take action on this matter so a decision can be reached to either
reserve the allocated funds for the purpose intended or, cancel that portion
of the loan/credit allotment.
Cr. No. 236 First Livestock Project: US$4.5 million credit of February 22,
1971. Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
Implementation of this project was delayed initially by difficul-
ties encountered by the Turkish authorities in fulfilling sorne of the effect-
iveness conditions under the Credit Agreement and by administrative problems
in hiring the necessary staff for the project unit. These delays were large-
ly due to the absence, following a reorganization of the Turkish Government
administration in March 1971, of an effective coordinating link between the
various ministries concerned with the project and between the Government and
the Bank Group. Steps have been taken to correct this deficiency and progress
on the project is now satisfactory.
Ln. No. 748 Education Project: US$13.5 million loan of June 9. 1971.
Closing Date: September 30, 1976.
The execution of the project is about two years behind schedule due
to the initial unwillingness of the Ministry of Education to provide the
project unit with adequate qualified staff and authority commensurate with
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project executions.

assigned responsibility. However, a significant change of attitude has re-
cently taken place in the Ministry. A new project director and deputy direc-
tor have now been appointed, other protracted vacancies have been filled, and
long standing problems concerning the appointment of technical assistance
specialists are in the process of being resolved. The procurement of equipment
(the major component of the project) is also now proceeding satisfactorily.
However, the preparation of training programs for the Management Training In-
stitute and the selection of fellowship candidates and staff remains in
abeyance pending enactment of long delayed legislation authorizing establish-
ment of the Institute. Revised cost estimates are being prepared by the
Project Unit but preliminary indications suggest cost overruns of about 65
percent above appraisal estimates. Except for commitment charges, no funds
have yet been disbursed, however, disbursements are expected to increase
significantly by the second half of FY75.
Ln. and Cr. Nos. 762/257 Fruit and Vegetable Export Project: US$10 million
Loan and US$15 million Credit of June 22, 1971. Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
This project was delayed by difficulties in meeting some of the
effectiveness conditions by the due date. Progress with 3 of 5 major project
components is satisfactory (refrigerated trucks, ferry boats, marketing
facilities). A new extension approach has been initiated to increase fruit
and vegetable production, the fourth component. The fifth, the agricultural
credit survey, is not likely to produce meaningful results, and other arrange-
ments have been made to prepare an agricultural credit project for Bank fi-
nancing.
Ln. No. 763 TEK Power Transmission Project: US$24 million loan of June 22,
1971. Closing Date: March 31, 1975.
Implementation of this project has been delayed by shortage of
staff. First contracts were awarded early in 1972 and work is now progress-
ing according to the revised schedule. Problems in meeting the financial
covenants were considered in connection with the Elbistan project which in-
corporates revised procedures.
Ln. No. 775 Fourth Cukurova Power Project: US$7 million loan of June 30, 1971.
Closing Date: March 31, 1975.
The project should be completed by the end of 1974 despite delays
in the supply of steel for substation structures. There has been an overall
increase of 33 percent in the cost of the Project due in part to increased
costs of some equipment. The beneficiary Cukurova E.A.S. is also facing a
serious shortage of cash stemming partly from the impact of increased fuel
oil costs and the company is presently reviewing this problem with the Govern-
ment.



ANNEX II

Cr. No. 281 Irrigation Rehabilitation Project: US$18 million credit of
January 25, 1972. Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
Civil works are well underway after a slow start. On-farm develop-
ment is progressing with the receipt of part of the new equipment, but is
still lagging behind schedule and will necessitate an extension of the credit
closing date. Appointment of consultants for the Extension Service and
Topraksu has not yet taken place because the Government has not authorized
Topraksu and/or the Extension Service to enter into contracts for more than
one year.
Ln. No. 817 Steel Mill Expansion Project: US$76 million loan of April 28,
1972. Closing Date: December 1976.
This project is about a year and a half behind schedule due to
delays in beginning procurement and ineffective management. Further signifi-
cant delays are expected unless immediate steps are taken by the Government
to install effective project management, obtain critically needed foreign
consultants, and realign the division of responsibility between the Board
and senior management. These problems have been discussed with the company
and Government during the past 18 months, and the most recent detailed recom-
mendations and a specific timetable for concrete action were sent to the Mi-
nister of Finance in September. The authorities had not yet taken specific
action by mid December, probably because of the change in Government.
Ln. No. 844 Istanbul Water Supply Project: US$37 million loan of June 30,
1972. Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
The amount of water now produced for Istanbul has increased by
48 percent since 1971 but shortages persist, particularly on the European
side. Project progress is about one year behind appraisal estimates, but
better progress is expected now that necessary consultants have been engaged.
Organizational changes are required soon, particularly since it appears that
the Istanbul Water Administration (ISI) is to become the regional water supply
and wastewater authority.
Cr. No. 324 Istanbul Urban Development Project: US$2.3 million credit of
June 30, 1972. Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
Four consultant groups started work between November 1973 and
February 1974. Work on the Wastewater and the Bus/Traffic Engineering and
Control Projects is proceeding satisfactorily. The Wholesale Market Complex
has been delayed due to questions about site suitability. The Urban and
Transport studies are proceeding with minor difficulties.

Ln. No. 845 IGSAS (Istanbul Fertilizer Company) Project: US$24 million loan
of June 30, 1972. Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
This loan was declared effective on October 6, 1972. Following
early delays in procurement, physical progress is now proceeding satisfactor-
ily, although it does not appear likely that a present 5-month delay in the
planned schedule can be made up due to extended deliveries of equipment in
short supply on the world market. Worldwide inflation and shortages have
increased costs by about $30 million, and an enlargement of the project ap-
proved by the Bank on October 11, 1973 raised the total financing gap to $48
million. The Government had informed the Bank of arrangements being taken to
finance the cost overrun, and the local currency cost of the enlargement of
the project. It has requested an $18 million loani to finance the foreign
exchange cost of the enlargement of the project.
Cr. No. 330 Second Livestock Project: US$16 million credit of September 28,
1972. Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
There has been delays in setting up the project's organization
mainly because of lack of action on the project's personnel budget. Steps
have recently been taken which it is hoped will improve this situation.
Ln. No. 873-TU TSKB (Industrial Development Bank of Turkey): US$40 million
Loan of December 28, 1972. Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Since the first Bank loan was made in 1950, a satisfactory rela-
tionship has been developed with TSKB whose standard of appraisal work is
consistently high.   The present loan to TSKB has been almost fully committed
and when completely disbursed will bring Bank lending to TSKB to $168 million.
Ln. and Cr. Nos. 883/360 TU, Ceyhan Aslantas Multipurpose Project: US$44
million loan and US$30 million credit of March 22, 1973. Closing Date:
December 31, 1981.
The loan/credit was made effective as of March 20, 1974. Construc-
tion underway thus far includes the access road to the camp site at Aslantas
dam, campsite buildings and some irrigation and drainage works on the left
bank of the Seyhan river. Energoproject has been appointed as engineering
consultant for the Aslantas Dam and Power plant. Contracts for on-farm
development equipment have been awarded. Because Topraksu and the Ministry
of Agriculture are not permitted to enter into international contracts they
cannot employ consultants for on-farm development and extension. The Govern-
ment has been urged to take immediate action to correct the situation.
Ln. No. 892 Istanbul Power Distribution Project: US$14.0 million loan of
May 25, 1973. Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
After a one year delay due primarily to the failure to hire consult-
ants, progress is now being made in developing regional engineering designs



ANNEX II
Page 7 of 8
and in carrying out a management study of the company. In addition, trans-
portation consultants started work in mid-July and consultants for the study
of gas generation and distribution are due to be selected shortly. The proj-
ect still has problems in terms of finance and manpower but there are signs
of improvement. The cost of the project is expected to increase as a result
of system growth and price escalation and the date for completion of the
project is now set for mid-1977, beyond the present closing date.
Ln. No. 893-TU Turkish State Railways: US$47 million loan of May 25, 1973.
Closing Date: September 30, 1976.
After initial delays, procurement of track material and other Bank-
financed items is now progressing satisfactorily. TCDD's locomotive produc-
tion is considerably behind schedule and, unless the remedial measures being
taken resolve production problems, this may adversely affect the project in
the long-run. In addition the track renewal program is proceeding slower
than planned, although the Railways expect more rapid progress in the next
year. Several provisions of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements, including
required increases in passenger tariffs, have not been carried out as sche-
duled and the Bank has informed the Guarantor and the Borrower that appraisal
of a second loan to the Railways, planned for FY 1975, will have to be post-
poned until the current difficulties in implementation of the present loan
are resolved.
Ln. No. 957-TU Antalya Forestry Project: US$40 million loan of January 28,
1974. Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Although the conditions of effectiveness have now been met, the
date for effectiveness for this loan has been extended for a fourth time to
the end of February, 1975, to allow the Government additional time to resolve
the question of plant site location. If no agreement is reached by that time,
however, the Government may consider cancelling the Loan to avoid paying com-
mitment charges since the search for an alternative site could delay the proj-
ect by a further 12 to 18 months. Implementation of the project is also being
delayed by difficulties in the hiring of consultants for forestry development
and studies.
Ln. No. 1023 Elbistan Lignite Mine and Power Project: US$148 million loan
of June 28, 1974. Closing Date: July 30, 1982.
This loan to the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) and the Turkish
Coal Authority (TKI) is to help finance the development of an open-cast
lignite mine in east central Turkey and the construction of an adjacent
lignite-burning 1200 megawatt power station and associated transmission lines.
Date for effectiveness of this loan, originally November 1, 1974, has been
postponed to March 31, 1975, to enable the Government to establish new elec-
tricity tariffs scheduled to be implemented by no later than March 15, 1975.

Ln. No. 1024-TU DYB (State Investment Bank of Turkey): US$40 million loan of
June 28, 1974. Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The loan was declared effective by September 30, 1974 as specified
in the Loan Agreement.
Technical Assistance Project - Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK): US$1.9
million grant of August 20, 1967.
Technical assistance contracts covering the second phase of the
work were terminated in November-December 1972. Achievement, though short
of target in some respects, is generally satisfactory and TEK now has a much
improved accounting, budgeting and financial reporting system. Reorganiza-
tion of TEK based on the consultants' report concerning organization structure
is underway. Contracts for the last phase of the work have been signed and
details of the final training program are being agreed upon.
