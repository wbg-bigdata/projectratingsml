APPRAISAL OF
TURKIYE SINAI KALKINMA BANKASI A.S.
TURKEY
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi A.S. (TSKB), the first private devel-
opment finance company which the Bank Group helped to establish, has made a
major contribution to the industrial development of Turkey. It has effective-
ly channelled sizeable local and foreign currency funds to the private indus-
trial sector, on the basis of a careful and sophisticated appraisal process.
It has already made a great impact on the industries which are concentrated
in and around the industrial centers of Istanbul, Izmir and Adana. TSKB has
shown continuous growth, at times in a difficult environment, during its 24-
year history. At the end of March 1974, TSKB's total assets had reached LT
3.4 billion, with its loan and equity portfolio amounting to LT 2.9 billion.
TSKB has an experienced management team and a competent staff.
ii.       During the First Economic Plan period (1963-67), TSKB financed an
average of 10.9% of the private manufacturing investment each year, but its
contribution declined to 8.6% during 1968-73, mainly due to limited resources,
especially lira funds. In 1968, TSKB started to guarantee bonds issued by
industrial enterprises. This has contributed, in some measure, to a broaden-
ing of the corporate bond market in Turkey.
iii.      Since the last Bank loan to TSKB (873-TU) was signed in 1972, TSKB
has taken further steps toward achieving geographical diversification of its
operations in line with the Government policy of reducing the geographical im-
balance in income and employment opportunities. It has opened two additional
branch offices - one in Eastern Anatolia and one on the Black Sea. TSKB's
Board approved new policy guidelines with a view to intensifying its activities
in those regions, and broadening its scope of work nationwide. In January
1974, TSKB was reorganized. Four Regional Departments were set up each having
the responsibility for planning and executing TSKB's investment programs in
the respective regions. As agreed upon with the Bank, TSKB earmarked 25% of
its gross spread on the proceeds of the loan to finance its promotional pro-
gram in the underdeveloped regions. While TSKB has taken a little longer
than expected to reorient and reorganize itself for diversifying its activities,
progress during the first half of 1974 has been impressive. Having gained
momentum, its promotional work in the underdeveloped regions is expected to
accelerate.
iv.       TSKB's portfolio is sound.  However, under the present tight credit
situation, TSKB has encountered mounting difficulties in loan collections:
some companies have liquidity problems; also, because of the rigid interest
ceiling, TSKB is unable to charge any penalty interest on delinquent loans
and a number of its clients are taking advantage of this and delaying repay-
ment. TSKB is tightening its collection procedures and hopes that the arrears
can be reduced considerably.



- ii -
v.        TSKB's financial performance has been good.  After paying a 15%
dividend, it has been able to retain more than half of its earnings. Trading
of TSKB's shares both in the Securities Exchange and over the counter has been
inactive and the average price was at 150% of par value in 1973.
vi.       As in the past, TSKB's volume of business will primarily be a func-
tion of available resources, particularly as regards lira lending. TSKB ex-
pects to mobilize, up to December 1976, around US$300 million equivalent in
foreign exchange and about LT 1.3 billion in lira.  Based on these resource
forecasts, TSKB expects to reach a commitment level of LT 1.4 billion in 1974,
LT 2.2 billion in 1975 and LT 2.8 billion in 1976.  Its anticipated foreign
exchange loans from Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau and the European Invest-
ment Bank are likely to total about US$100 million, leaving about US$200
million to be raised from other sources (including IBRD) during the same
period. TSKB obtained Government permission in September, 1974 to raise
$25 million in the international capital markets and expects to raise an
additional $100 million from the same market sources during 1975-76. With
respect to TSKB's local currency requirements, it is assumed that it would
be able to finance the projected lending and equity investments with self-
generated cash flow, together with additional share capital and bond issues
of LT 200 million in 1975 and LT 335 million in 1976. These projections are
conservative, compared with potential demand.
vii.      TSKB remains a suitable and creditworthy borrower for Bank funds.
The prospects for expanding its volume of business are good, and its role in
developing and financing projects in the underdeveloped regions will be in-
creasing. It is recommended that the Bank make a loan to TSKB in the amount
of US$65 million equivalent, which would enable TSKB to meet approximately
one-third of its foreign exchange resource gap in the two-year period ending
December 31, 1976. TSKB needs to borrow continually in the international
capital markets to meet its remaining resource gap. Under the present mar-
ket conditions, IFC's assistance in organizing a consortium for lending to
TSKB will be very useful.
viii.     The terms of the loan should be those normally applied to loans to
development finance companies, including the standard commitment charge.
ix.       Although the interest rate ceilings on lending were revised by the
Government in October 1974 and the ceiling on corporate bonds was raised in
December 1974, it is still not possible for TSKB to raise funds in the domes-
tic capital markets at a positive spread. The Bank should continue its dia-
logue with the Government concerning the need to allow sufficient flexibility
in the lending rates charged by financial institutions so as to reduce the
negative spread on domestic borrowing.



APPRAISAL OF
TURKIYE SINAI KALKINMA BANKASI A.S.
TURKEY
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi A.S. (TSKB, Industrial Development
Bank of Turkey) was established in 1950. It is the oldest client among the
development finance companies (dfcs) associated with the Bank Group, and has
received six loans and four credits, totalling US$168 million. IFC became a
shareholder in 1963, and presently holds 10.8% of TSKB's share capital. A
loan of US$10 million was made to TSKB in 1973 by IFC together with the
Industrial Bank of Japan.
1.02      This report appraises TSKB for a new loan.  It focuses on TSKB's
overall performance and new developments since the previous Bank loan was
made in December 1972. Because of the Bank's familiarity with TSKB, history
and description are kept to a minimum. A detailed review of the economy of
Turkey can be found in "The Economic Development of Turkey", 316a-TU, dated
April 22, 1974. The present report is primarily based on the findings of the
appraisal mission to TSKB in May-June 1974, composed of Messrs. Edgar Su,
Hans Griesshaber and Philippe Lietard.
II. THE ENVIRONMENT
A. The Economy
2.01      The Turkishi economy has grown at a high rate in recent years.  GNl
in real terms increased by 10.7% in 1971, 7.6% in 1972, 5.5% in 1973 and an
estimated 8.1% in 1974. A low growth in 1973 was caused by severe drought.
Lxpansion was particularly rapid in the industrial sector, where annual growth
averaged 11.5% during the four-year period.  Other sectors recording high
growth rates in 1973 included trade, construction, transport and communication.
Fixed investment rose in real terms by 14%o in 1973 and an estimated 16% in 1974.
2.02      This favorable development was mainly due to a large increase in
domestic demand, stimulated by high levels of investment, workers' remittances
and exports--including industrial exports. In 1973, workers' remittances
increased by 58%, reaching US$1.2 billion, while total exports expanded at a
rate of 49%. Althougii tilis trend has continued in 1974, the growthi rates
appear to be muchi lower than in 1973. Workers' remittances are expected to
be around 71.5 biilion, only 262. growth over the previous year, and exports
around $1.7 billion, only 29% increase over the 1973 level. The rise in ex-
ports was due to price increases--export volume actually declined during 1974.
(It should be noted, however, that exports still play a minor role in Turkey's
economy--about US$1.3 billion or 6% of GNP in 1973.)



2.03      Imports also grew rapidly, resulting in a widening of the foreign
trade deficit. Imports grew by 33% in 1973 but are projected to grow by about
70% in 1974, resulting in a large trade deficit in 1974. However, due to the
large workers' remittances and tourism earnings in 1973 the current account
balance showed a positive amount and in 1974 it is projected to show a small
negative amount. Foreign exchange reserves reached an all time high of $2.3
billion in March 1974 compared with $1.4 billion in 1972, but this level was
expected to decline by about $400 million by the end of 1974.
2.04      Growth in demand, however, has been more rapid than growth in out-
put. As a result, the rate of inflation increased sharply to about 20% in
1973, and continued at a high rate in 1974. To take the pressure off domestic
demand, the Government liberalized imports of certain foodstuffs and consumer
goods. At the same time, it curbed the export of machinery and some essential
raw materials (e.g. cotton yarn, cement, logs). In addition, the Government
set up a Price Control Board which must approve all proposed price increases
by industrial firms. In May 1974, the lira was revalued against the dollar
by 4%Z, the new exchange rate being US$1 - LT 13.50. In September 1974, the
exchange rate was changed again, this time to US$1 = LT 13.85.
2.05      In the monetary sector, the Central Bank increased reserve require-
ents twice during 1973, from 20% to finally 30%, and suspended its rediscount
facilities to commercial banks until April 1974. Furthermore, the new Gov-
ernment restricted the approval of suppliers' credits. Commercial banks have
fulfilled the requirement that 10% of their portfolio should be in the form
of medium-term loans to industry, leaving little scope for fresh funds from
this source. These developments and a reduction in budgetary deficits have
resulted in a tightening of the money supply in 1974 to an extent unprecedent-
ed during the last few years. With a view to enabling the banking sector to
mobilize savings more effectively, the Government increased the interest
rate ceiling on demand and time deposits by 1/2-2%, effective as of Octo-
ber 1, 1974, and allowed the rate on deposits of more than two years to
be determined by the banks and depositors. At the same time, the ceiling
rate on short-term loans was increased from 10.5% to 11.5%' and that on
medium- and long-terni loans from 12% to 14%. The ceiling rate on corporate
bond issues was subsequently increased from 15%' to 18,%.
B. The Industrial Sector
2.06      Industrial growth has been impressive.  Value added in industry
grew at an average of 9.8% annually during the Second Plan (1968-72) and an
estimated 15% in 1973. The share of industry in GDP rose from about 20% in
1968 to 23% in 1973. More spectacular has been the rise of industrial invest-
ment in the private sector. Private fixed capital formation in manufacturing
increased in real terms by 8.7% in 1971, 21% in 1972, and an estimated 41% in
1973. In current prices, private industrial investment increased from LT 6.5
billion in 1972 to an estimated LT 10.9 billion in 1973, whereas public in-
vestment in mLanufacturing stagnated in 1973 at a level of LT 5.9 billion 1/.
1/   The share of the State Investment Bank (DYB) in financing public indus-
trial investment increased, however, by 15% in 1973.



2.07      The acceleration of private investment in the industrial sector was
stimulated by relatively high protection 1/ and generous incentives (Annex 1).
As an associate member of EEC, Turkey agreed to eliminate customs duties over
12 years for a list of goods amounting to about 55% of total imports from EEC
and consisting largely of raw and intermediate materials. For the remaining
list of goods, which includes most industrial products, tariffs wil be elimi-
nated over a period of 22 years (beginning 1970), so that the effect on Turkish
industry will be small in the short run.
C. Financial Community
2.08      Industrial Finance.  TSKB was the only institutional source of
medium- and long-term finance for private industrial investment until 1963,
when the Industrial Investment and Credit Bank (SYKB) was established by,
six major private commercial banks. SYKB provides primarily medium-term
finance to meet working capital needs.  In recent years, an increasing por-
tion of its resources has been used for investment credit, though compared
with TSKB it plays only a limited role, especially as a source of foreign
exchange (obtained from USAID).
2.09      Resource mobilization for the development of private investment
in industry has continued to be a major problem, which has been aggravated
since 1973 by the sharp rise of inflation. TSKB will find it more difficult
to meet demands for its funds unless it is allowed to have access to suffi-
cient resources both in the domestic and the international markets and to re-
lend such resources at interest rates which can cover their costs. Further
discussions on TSKB's resource problem are in paras. 4.07-4.09 and 5.01-5.05.
2.10      A major part of private investment in manufacturing is financed
by increase in equity. The financing pattern for private fixed investment
in industry has roughly the following structure: internal resources and un-
organized money market 65%, long-term loans from TSKB and SYKb 10-12%, for-
eign direct investment and suppliers' credits 10-15%, commercial banks 6-8%,
and corporate bonds 3-5%.
2.11      In 1973, TSKB's disbursements corresponded to about 9% of the total
private fixed industrial investment of some LT 11 billion in that year, and
this share has tended to drop slightly over time from a level of over 10%
during 1963-1968. As a source of foreign exchange, TSKB is more prominent,
its share amounting to 18% in 1973 with a high of 21% in 1970.
1/   In 1972 the average import taxes and duties amounted to approximately
40% of import value.



-4-
2.12      Institutional Arrangements.  Maximum interest rates have been fixed
by the Government both for credits and deposits. For medium- and long-term
loans in domestic as well as foreign currency, the interest rate ceiling, which
had been 12% since the lira devaluation in 1970, was increased to 14% as of
October 1, 1974 (see Annex 2 for information on the cost of capital to industry
after the increase). On the other hand, in tapping local resources, financial
institutions (and corporations) may now pay up to 18% interest on bond issues.
Costs rise to 18.7% if all expenses related to bond issues are included, re-
sulting in a minimum negative spread of 4.7%. The net yield (after withholding
tax of 20%) to bond buyers amounts to 14.4%. This is still not considered a
very attractive yield to the general public, but TSKB expects to be able to
place a very substantial volume of its bonds with institutional investors.
2.13      Since inter-bank transactions are subject to a transaction tax of
25%, the costs of any borrowings by TSKB from the banking system would also
be higher than the new maximum lending rate of 14%.
2.14      Borrowings from commercial sources abroad are subject to a 20%. with-
holding tax and 3% fiscal equilibrium tax. Depending on the conditions pre-
vailing on the international capital markets, these taxes at times must be
absorbed by the Turkish borrowing institution. At the present high interest
level abroad and given the lending rate ceiling, it may not be possible for
TSKB to maintain a significant positive spread.
2.15      The Capital Market.  Apart from Government bonds, the only long-
term, fixed interest financial instrument available in Turkey is corporate
bonds. TSKB took a lead in guaranteeing bonds in 1968 and the following few
years when it was recognized that this new market would only be successful
in attracting capital if corporate bonds were guaranteed by prestigious fi-
nancial institutions.
2.16      The total value of annual issues of corporate bonds has grown
rapidly since 1968, reaching LT 560 million in 1973 and LT 282 million dur-
ing the first five months of 1974. The market, however, is still fairly thin.
TSKB started to issue bonds itself (at the previous maximum interest rate of
15%), with an issue of LT 50 million (9% of the value of total issues) in
1973 and LT 50 million in April 1974. Another LT 100 million will be issued
by TSKB by the end of 1974, in line with the understanding reached for the 1973
Bank loan.
2.17      The share of bond issues guaranteed by TSKB, other banks and hold-
ing companies has declined noticeably since 1968. While in 1968, virtually
all bond issues were guaranteed, the share of guaranteed bonds dropped to 68%
in 1973 and 57% in the first five months of 1974 in terms of value, with a
similar development in terms of number of issues. This is apparently due to
a growing public confidence in the large and well established corporations
making use of the bond market as well as to the high guaranteeing and under-
writing costs to the borrower.



- 5-
2.18      Government bonds yield an interest of only 11%, but have the advan-
tage that interest payments are tax-free.  Government bonds further enjoy a
captive market with banks and social security organizations. In 1972, long-
term Government bonds issued totalled about LT 4 billion, the bulk of which
was issued by the public sector dfc, DYB.
2.19      The market for corporate stock is not yet well developed.  Most of
the capital of joint stock companies is controlled by families or by a small
number of shareholders. Fresh capital is usually raised from existing owners.
TSKB, which attempts to revolve its equity portfolio, was the main supply of
private corporate stock for individual savers until 1973.
2.20      The situation changed when the bond market started to suffer from
the tight money policy and the rising inflation. In view of the interest
ceiling on bonds, the public shifted to higher yielding securities, i.e. shares
in holding companies and others. In the first five months of 1974, share issues
offered to the public exceeded LT 1.2 billion. Not all issues, however, could
be sold, the successful issues amounting to about two-thirds of total issues
in terms of value.
D. The Development Plan (1973-77) and Prospects
2.21      Major Goals.  Like its predecessors, the Third Plan places heavy
emphasis on industrialization, particularly on the promotion of intermediate
and capital goods industries. A restrictive attitude is taken with respect
to foreign direct investment, which would be allowed only when it provides
new technology. 1/ The Plan assigns a substantial role to the private sec-
tor within a gradually less protected environment, as the country moves to-
ward full membership in the EEC. To narrow the regional imbalances, the
Plan proposes the development of 36 provinces and 50 districts identified
as the poorest ones (see map, Annex 3), mainly through modernization of
agricultural production, expanded public investment, and promotion of
private investment.
2.22      The Plan provides for a GNP growth of 8% annually.  Industry is
expected to grow at 11.3% per annum, raising its share in GDP from the present
23% to 27% by 1977. Total investment is projected to grow at a target rate of
12.7% per annum and private investment at 12.1%, with the share of public in-
vestment in the total rising from 52% in 1972 to 56% in 1977. The basic prin-
ciple in investment policy set out in the Plan is that the State will undertake
high priority investments (mostly those introducing new technology or providing
substantial external economies) in areas where, because of long gestation pe-
riods, high capital requirements, or high risks, the private sector does not
venture, even when provided with reasonable inducements. On the other hand,
the Plan specifies that State Economic Enterprises (SEEs) will not invest in
new activities where the private sector has been successful.
1/   In 1973, foreign investment amounted to US$83 million or 10% of private
industrial investment.



- 6 -
2.23      The Plan continues to emphasize the growth of output and labor pro-
ductivity rather than employment. As a result, the labor surplus, including
underemployment in agriculture (estimated at 11 to 12% of the labor force in
1973) will further increase. This trend is aggravated by the recent ban on
emigration of workers to Germany.
2.24      Exports are projected to grow at 10% annually and industrial exports
at 21%. But in the light of recent experience indicating a growth in indus-
trial exports of more than 90% in 1973, exports of manufactures probably will
increase faster. The major increases in industrial exports are expected in
textiles, processed forest products, petrochemicals, leather products, elec-
trical machinery, and non-ferrous metals.
2.25      Prospects.  On the whole, the targets of the Third Plan are realis-
tic. But there are several snags. The supply of power has not kept pace with
the fast growing demand. Even with the additional capacities expected, the
system will be strained until 1978. The shortage of skilled labor and man-
agerial staff could also become a constraint in the fulfillment of the Plan's
industrial targets. Also, the need to contain the increasing inflationary
pressure may necessitate restrictive monetary and fiscal policies on public
and private investment. The comfortable foreign exchange position affords the
Government flexibility in combating inflation. However, the rise in oil prices
may increase Turkey's net oil import bill by US$300 million in 1974 alone.
Furthermore, the German ban on additional immigration may slow down exchange
earnings from this source. Finally, the financing of the Plan's ambitious
public investment program will require fiscal reforms and a substantial im-
provement in the financial performance of the SEEs, which is difficult to
achieve.
2.26      The coalition Government formed in January 1974 did not change the
overall growth targets of the Development Plan. The Government did not define
its policy towards the private industrial sector, aside from placing high
priority on correcting regional disparities.  Lately the issue of investment
incentives has in principle been limited to industrial projects in the less
developed regions. Moreover, the Ministry of Industry is in the process of
establishing a Research and Planning Department with a view to identifying
investment opportunities for medium-sized projects. For their financing,
it is intended to mobilize savings of returning migrant workers and funds
from compensation for Government expropriation of land in Eastern Anatolia in
connection with the construction of the Keban Dam. Furthermore, in April 1974,
the Central Bank started rediscounting industrial bills (up to five years),
again under a new scheme which is expected to help ease the tight credit sit-
uation. An amount of LT 1.5 billion has been earmarked for 1974. The com-
mercial banks and dfcs can utilize the rediscount facilities, withi the former
limited to their total equity and no limit for the latter. The Central Bank
rediscounts the bills up to 50% for projects located in less developed regions
and 30% for those in developed regions. In the short run, this would make it
possible for TSLB to roll over part of its portfolio.

III. TSKB'S STRUCTURE
A. Ownership and Control
3.01      Shareholders.  Since TSKB's share capital increase in 1972, there
has been no major change in the ownership structure. A list of TSKB's share-
holders is in Annex 4. Turkiye Is Bankasi remains the largest shareholder,
holding 20.8% of the total. The five registered foreign shareholders hold
13.3% of the total. IFC is the second biggest shareholder with 10.8% of the
total.
3.02      Board.  A list of Board members is shown in Annex 5.  In March 1974,
Mr. Ferid Basmaci, Chairman of the Board since February 1969, resigned and
Mr. Selahattin Karahan, General M4anager of Turkiye Is Bankasi, was elected as
the new Chairman.  He is considered to be a highly competent banker.  The terms
of all Board members will expire in MIarch 1975.
B. Management and Staff
3.03      With a view to broadening its scope of activities, particularly in
less developed areas, TSKB's organizational structure underwent a major change
on January 1, 1974. TSKB's organization chart is attached as Annex 6.
3.04      The new structure establishes four Regions:  (1) Northwestern
Anatolia, (2) Southwestern Anatolia, (3) Central Anatolia, and (4) Eastern
Anatolia. Their geographical boundaries are shown in Annex 3. Each Regional
Department is headed by a Department Manager, under whom two Project Managers
supervise the financial analysts. The Regional Department Managers are re-
sponsible for planning and executing TSKB's investment programs in their re-
spective areas. The engineers and economists are grouped separately in the
Engineering and Research Departments, and are assigned temporarily to the
Regions for appraisal or end-use work. Most of the other departments have
remained unchanged. Experience in the first half of 1974 indicates that the
reorganization had been effective and beneficial, but it is too early for a
full assessment (see para 3.11).
3.05      In May 1974, three new Assistant General Managers were appointed
to exercise supervision over (1) Resources, Accounting and Disbursements;
(2) Research; and (3) Loans and Investments, respectively. Mr. Eroguz was
promoted to Senior Assistant General Manager, having broad responsibilities
in the new management structure. Mr. R. Egeli, who has been associated with
TSKB since its founding, continues to serve as the General Manager. With the
participation of the three new Assistant General Managers in high-level dis-
cussions on policy and operational matters, the decision-making process of the
management team is expected to be strengthened and accelerated. To reinforce
the regionalization work, TSKB has opened two new regional branches in addition
to the existing branches in Adana and Izmir: in Elazig (March 1973) and Samsun



- 8 -
(February 1974). At present, the staff strength of the regional branch offices
is inadequate. Based on the needs of each branch office, additional staff
should be assigned on a permanent basis. TSKB is reviewing the need, and will
take the necessary action to strengthen its branch offices.
3.06      TSKB has a staff of about 265, of whom 38 are managers, 78 "pro-
fessionals", 92 administrative and clerical staff, and 57 general services
personnel. This represents an increase of 18% over the staff strength at the
end of 1972. The recent organizational and personnel changes are expected to
boost morale and keep the staff turnover at its past low level. TSKB has built
up a highly competent staff, with a degree of professionalism that many other
dfcs have yet to attain. The relatively high level of TSKB's administrative
expenses (1.4% of average total assets in 1973) is partly explained by the
competitive salaries paid to its staff members.
C. Policies and Procedures
3.07      Policy  Statement.  TSKB's Statement of Policies is in Annex 7.
TSKB operates almost exclusively in the industrial sector. Until recently, it
has interpreted its policy limits conservatively. It accepts applications
above US$50,000 for foreign currency loans and above LT 200,000 for local
currency loans and gives careful consideration to economic merits as well as
the financial soundness and profitability of the projects it finances. On
September 21, 1973, TSKB's Board amended the Policy Resolution adopted in
March 1963, and stated that TSKB's maximum equity investments could be in-
creased from the previously established LT 175 million up to its paid-in
share capital and reserves (LT 376 million as of March 31, 1974).
3.08      A major change since last appraisal was the adoption on October 19,
1973 of the new Operational Policies, which resulted in the reorganization
described in paragraph 3.04. The new policy guidelines focus mainly on: (a)
the promotion of investments in less developed areas of Turkey, and assistance
to potential entrepreneurs in project identification, preparation, and financ-
ing (including joint financing); (b) the close follow-up of sector and sub-
sector developments and the making of investment estimates for these sectors;
and (c) a broadening of TSKB's scope of financing to include tourism and serv-
ices. Further elaborations of these policy guidelines were approved by TSKB's
Board on June 7, 1974, assigning priority in TSKB's resource allocation to
industrial investment in the underdeveloped regions, and limiting its lending
operations in the developed areas to enterprises which have no other means
of securing resources domestically or abroad.
3.09      TSKB has expressed firmly to the Bank, both before and during nego-
tiations, its objective of allocating, during 1975-1976, as much of its re-
sources in the less developed regions as that invested in the developed re-
gions. A formal policy resolution to this effect was adopted by TSKB's
Board on December 12, 1974 (Annex 7).



- 9 -
3.10      Relations with Government.  TSKB's relations with the Government
center on contacts with the State Planning Organization (SPO), the Ministry
of Industry and Technology, and the Ministry of Finance. SPO is closely in-
volved with overall industrial investment in the public and private sectors.
The Ministry of Industry and Technology's approval is required for incentives
available for industrial projects. TSKB's assistance in securing the incen-
tives for its clients has not been necessary, since the sponsors of industrial
projects have been able to obtain it directly. In the future, TSKB's role is
expected to increase with regard to the projects identified and/or designed by
its promotional staff in underdeveloped regions.
3.11      Project Appraisal.  Since the reorganization in January 1974,
appraisal teams have been constituted for each project, under the supervi-
sion of the Project Manager of the relevant Region. Each team consists of
one engineer from the Engineering Department, one economist from the Research
Department, and one financial analyst from the Regional Department. Under the
old structure, all appraisal staff belonged to one department, called "Project
Appraisal Department." The efficiency of the decentralization of team work
has not yet been clearly demonstrated, but is being closely watched by the
management. Moreover, the recent series of promotions left a vacuum at the
working team level, which may affect the efficiency and quality of work until
new staff are recruited and corrective steps are taken.
3.12      The quality of project appraisal remains high.  TSKB makes in-depth
assessments of the economic, marketing, technical and financial aspects of
the projects; technology, type of equipment, financial plan and economic vi-
ability are carefully checked by the relevant team members. In January 1974,
TSKB started to calculate the economic rate of return on all new projects,
and on large expansion projects. This replaced the calculation of effective
rate of protection which TSKB had been using in evaluating the economic merit
of its projects for the past three years (see paras 4.17-4.21). TSKB helpF
entrepreneurs to overcome problems encountered in loan application, planning,
implementation and operation of the projects. In the past, TSKB has not
focussed on the employment effects of its projects, since most of them are
in industrialized regions and are capital intensive. As TSKB moves to the
underdeveloped areas, it should try to consider this factor.
3.13      Rapid increases in prices of imported machinery and in local con-
struction costs have resulted in frequent cost overruns. TSKB's appraisal
takes into account recent price trends in its cost estimates. But contin-
gencies are often inadequate. Given the present inflationary situation, this
matter deserves more attention by TSKB than in the past.
3.14      Procurement and Disbursement.  TSKB's procedures for guiding and
controlling procurement by its clients seem appropriate and contribute to
the overall quality of TSKB projects. In many cases, TSKB provides sponsors
with information on the best sources of procurement, which has resulted in
significant savings. Overall, disbursement procedures are satisfactory.



- 10 -
3.15      Project Supervision.  The Follow-Up Department under the old set-
up had been considered a useful tool to TSKB's management, and its end-use
reports were an important source of information about TSKB's clients and
operations. As a result of the recent reorganization, the Follow-Up Depart-
ment has been dismantled and the responsibility for end-use work distributed
among the four Regional Departments. The end-use procedures followed by TSKB
during the past eight years are being revised. TSKB will attempt to collect
additional information from its clients to facilitate its future sector studies.
While the reorganization was taking effect, TSKB's end-use work appeared to be
weakened. TSKB's management has recognized this and is making a great effort
to put the end-use system on a sounder and more efficient basis. Preliminary
plans are satisfactory but the Bank will continue to press TSKB in the direc-
tion of a thorough supervision of its clients.
D. Promotion and Research Program
3.16      Under the last Bank loan, TSKB undertook to strengthen its promo-
tional efforts in the less developed regions. Progress was slow at first but
gained momentum after TSKB's reorganization in January 1974. As agreed upon
with the Bank, TSKB has been assigning 25% of the spread on the last Bank loan
to a Special Promotion Account to finance its promotional activities. As of
July 31, 1974, approximately LT 3 million had been allocated to the Account,
against which LT 700,000 had been committed and LT 312,000 disbursed. This
has been used to finance pre-investment studies, special research and sub-
sector studies. For 1974 as a whole, TSKB expects to spend LT 1.6 million
under the Special Promotion Account, to identify 15 to 20 new projects which
require pre-feasibility studies, most of which are under preparation.
3.17      TSKB is continuing to expand its promotional operations in the under-
developed regions of Turkey. The comprehensive 1974-1977 promotion program
consists of sector studies, research on various subjects including agriculturai
wastes, and feasibility studies on agro-based and other types of projects.
Arrangements for the studies and research are under way, and foreign consultants
will be engaged when local expertise is unavailable. According to TSKB's es-
timates, promotional expenditures will amount to about LT 29 million (US$2.1
million equivalent) in the four-years 1974-1977. The allocation provided under
the last Bank loan would amount to $1.76 million during the same period, and
TSKB can cover the balance from its ordinary administrative funds. The Bank
will review TSKB's promotion program and its funding from time to time.
IV. TSKB'S OPERATIONS
A. Summary
4.01      A summary of operations for 1970-1973 and the first three months
of 1974 is given in Annex 8. TSKB's overall operations reached a record peak
in 1973, but declined sharply in the first quarter of 1974. Since local cur-
rency resources could not be replenished, TSKB decided to stop all its lira
lending in the developed regions toward the end of 1973.



- 11 -
4.02      TSKB's total commitments in 1973 including bond guarantees (para
5.03) amounted to LT 1.1 billion, representing an increase of 64% over 1972
and 198% over 1971. The commitments amounted to LT 172.1 million equivalent
in the first quarter of 1974, representing a decline of 36% on an annual basis.
Lira lending reached the lowest level in many years. In the period from
January 1, 1973 through March 31, 1974, foreign currency loans represented the
bulk of the commitments (78.2%) while local currency loans accounted for 13.1%
of the total. Equity investments and guarantee of bond issues accounted for
4.5% and 4.2% of the total operations, respectively. Disbursements reached
LT 979.2 million in 1973, a record level, but in the first quarter of 1974,
total amount disbursed corresponded to only 20% of the total disbursements in
1973.  Tentative data on TSKB's operations for the first eight months showed
that the declining trend continued. The foreign currency loan commitments
in January-August 1974 amounted to $28.8 million, compared with $59.3 million
for the entire year 1973, a decline of 27% on an annual basis. Local currency
loan commitments dropped more sharply, 55%, from LT 155.6 million in 1973 to
LT 46.8 million in the first eight months of 1974. Equity investments amounted
to LT 53.6 million, which approximated the level reached during the entire year
1973.
B. Lending Operations
4.03      TSKB's foreign exchange lending reached LT 830 million on commit-
ment basis in 1973, which was more than twice the level for 1972 and four
times the level for 1971.  Local currency loans, however, amounting to LT
155.6 million in 1973, declined to 17% from the previous year. Lending
operations for the first three months of 1974 show an even further decline.
4.04      Analyses of the characteristics of loans approved in terms of type
of industry, size and geographical distribution are included in Annexes 9,
10 and 11. The following facts are significant:
(a)  TSKB's lending operations in 1973 and the first quarter of 1974
were well diversified among various industries. From January
1970 to March 1974, the four largest beneficiaries of TSKB's
loans were the textile industry (34%), the chemical industry
(14%), the food and beverage industry (10%), and metal products
(7%). Twenty-one other industrial categories received less
than 5% of TSKB's total financing.
(b)  The average size of TSKB's loans approved continued to increase,
from LT 4.8 million in 1970 to LT 11.7 million in 1973, partly
due to the rapid growth in size of the industrial projects im-
plemented by the private sector. Only 18% of all loans were
under LT 5 million in 1973, compared with 27.7% in 1970. This
is partly attributable to the fact that industrial firms are
now able to obtain some foreign exchange from Government
allocations for replacement of worn-out equipment, instead of
relying entirely on TSKB for foreign exchange financing, as
was the case in previous years.



- 12 -
(c)  In 1973, 70% of TSKB's loans were for financing of expansion
or modernization projects, compared with 37% in 1971 and 1972.
Conversely, 31% of TSKB's loans were extended to 40 new companies
or existing clients for initiating new products, compared with
an average of 63% in 1971 and 1972. While the future trend is
not accurately predictable, it is clear that the number of new
companies and new projects will increase as the promotion pro-
gram is accelerated.
(d)  Concentration of investments in the Marmara Sea region, includ-
ing Istanbul, had been a characteristic of TSKB's business in
past years; this has been changing gradually. Loans approved
in the Marmara Sea region accounted for 85% of the total in
1970, and 64% in 1973.
4.05      The 1974 Annual Program prepared by SPO includes a list of provinces
or districts designated as "underdeveloped", the remaining part of Turkey being
considered as "developed." The definition is based on a composite index of
social and economic development. Moreover, four provinces (Edirne, Elazig,
Gaziantep and Malatya), though "developed," will continue to be regarded as
"underdeveloped" provinces for the applications for incentives to be submitted
before the end of 1976. The map of Turkey in Annex 3 shows the underdeveloped
areas of Turkey as defined by SPO. Though geographical distribution does not
exactly coincide with the four TSKB regions, TSKB Regions III and IV (Central
and Eastern Anatolia) are largely less developed.
4.06      In 1972, 14% of commitments of loans and equity participations were
in regions considered by SPO as underdeveloped or eligible for incentives.
In. 1973, the share of TSKB's involvement in the underdeveloped regions dropped
to 9.7% due to its financing of a number of large projects in the developed
regions. In the first quarter of 1974, the situation changed radically: 32%
of loans and equity participations already committed were in the underdeveloped
areas, and this percentage is estimated to reach 47% for the entire year of
1974; TSKB's share in the total cost of the projects is higher in the under-
developed than in the developed areas--47.4X0 versus 27.4%; 51% of the projects
financed by TSKB in underdeveloped areas are in the food or textile sectors.
C. Interest Rate
4.07      TSKB has always charged the maximum interest rate on long-term lend-
ing allowed by the Turkish Government. From November 1970 through September
1974, TSKB charged interest at 12% p.a. on both foreign and local currency
loans. On October 1, 1974, TSKB increased its lending rate to 14%, following
the Government's new decree on interest rates. TSKB's sub-borrowers of foreign
currency funds have been assuming the foreign exchange risk and this arrange-
ment is not likely to change in the near future. While the regulated interest
rate on long-term loans in Turkey has always been below the equilibrium market
rate, the subsidy element in TSKB's lending rate on foreign currency loans,
which constituted 78% of its overall lending operations during 1970-1973, is



- 13 -
substantially smaller than the subsidization implied in its local currency
lending. TSKB has been allowed to maintain a spread of 4-1/2% on the subordi-
nated loan from the Government and a 2-1/2% spread on funds from the European
Investment Bank (EIB), Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW), and the United
States Agency for International Development (USAID).  The Government has set
no limit on the spread on Bank funds.  In view of the large spread on the
last Bank loan (4-3/4%), TSKB and the Bank had agreed that TSKB would set
aside 25% of the spread on loan for promotional expenses, and that TSKB would
float domestic bond issues of LT 200 million at negative spreads in 1973-1974.
As a result, TSKB's spread on all its resources has been reduced from 3.9% to
around 3.6%. Taking into account all new loans obtained in 1974, the average
spread is around 3.2%.
4.08      Impact of New Rate on Lira Borrowing.- TSKB has been unable to
raise sufficient lira funds to meet the investment demand (paras 2.12, 2.16
and 5.03). The increase in TSKB's lending rate from 12% to 14% in October
enhanced TSKB's ability to support higher cost of floating lira bonds. On
the other hand, the recent increase from 15% to 18% for domestic bond issues
should have a positive effect. This still involves, however, a negative
spread on lira transactions. While TSKB agreed to issue bonds at a negative
spread during 1973 and 1974 as one of the conditions of the last Bank loan,
this was a stop-gap measure. Bank loans should not become a means of subsidizing
TSKB's floating of lira bonds at negative spreads. The net spread accruing
to TSKB under the proposed Bank loan will be limited to 2-1/2% and the balance
(3-1/2%) will be paid to the Government as guarantee fee. Should TSKB continue
to incur losses in raising funds by bond issues, the average spread on all
resources in use must nevertheless continue to be a "reasonable" one, without
over-reliance on one particular source of funds, such as Bank loans. An
"average-spread" formula can be justified if there are no excessive distortions
between borrowing and lending rates. TSKB is planning to raise bond issues
for about LT 535 million in 1975 and 1976 and is hopeful that the Government
will make further changes in its lending rate possible. Until this happens,
however, TSKB will continue to incur a negative spread in relending the pro-
ceeds of its lira bond issues.
4.09      Impact of New Rate on Foreign Exchange Borrowing.  On foreign ex-
change loans extended against resources from EIB and KfW, TSKB's spread was
not affected by the change in lending rate because it has been allowed to
earn a fixed net spread of 2-1/2%. And, since a very small balance was left
in the last Bank loan when the new interest rate of 14% was put into effect,
TSKB's additional gain on Bank funds is negligible. With respect to funds
to be raised in the international capital markets, the cost is now so high
that TSKB may only be able to borrow in these markets at a zero spread or at
a negligible positive spread, given the lending rate ceiling of 1b%.
As detailed in para 6.06, TSKB would in any event have to seek foreign exchange
financing from as yet unidentified sources to meet part of the financing de-
mand over the next two years. In September 1974, the Government gave TSKB
permission to raise $25 million equivalent in the international capital
markets, subject to the Government's agreement on terms and conditions.
IFC has been asked by TSKB to organize a consortium with financial institu-
tions to raise the above amount. Finding lenders willing to make relatively



- 14 -
long-term loans at a fixed interest rate is extremely difficult. TSKB may
therefore have to accept loans at a floating rate, to some limited extent.
This imposes a risk upon TSKB, given the interest rate ceiling fixed by the
Government. However, the risk is acceptable at least for the period of the
proposed loan since the amount of borrowing in foreign capital markets would
be relatively limited. Still, it is far from an ideal solution and it would
be desirable to have a different arrangement for the long term. During the
next two years, TSKB will endeavor to raise an additional $100 million in the
international capital markets. Should the average total cost of the new
foreign resources raised in international capital markets exceed the current
ceiling rate for lending (14%), it would further erode TSKB's profitability.
Thus, continued close consultation between TSKB, the Government and the Bank
on this matter is imperative.
D. Equity Investments
4.13      In 1973, TSKB committed equity investments in five new companies
and exercised its preemptive rights in five existing companies for a total of
LT 50.8 million compared with LT 41.2 million in 1972. In the first quarter
of 1974, the commitment was in two new companies and one old client for a
total LT 5.8 million. As of March 31, 1974, TSKB's equity portfolio amounted
to LT 169.1 million of shares in 34 firms.
4.14      In 1973, TSKB sold all its shares in three companies and some of
its shares in another one, totalling LT 44.9 million, at an average 169.7%
of par value. The total capital gain was LT 18.4 million. During the first
quarter of 1974, no share sales have taken place.
4.15      TSKB's equity portfolio is not as diversified as its loan port-
folio: the metal industry accounts for the biggest part of the total (42.0%).
The construction materials industry and the plastics industry are second and
third, with 12.3% and 12.0% of its portfolio, respectively. TSKB's equity in-
vestment in the textile industry is low (less than 1%) compared with the per-
centage in its loan portfolio (33.6%).
4.16      One factor limiting equity purchases is the lira resources situation.
Another one is a result of industrial companies' preference for financing in-
vestments by raising funds from family members. TSKB intends to expand its
equity investments. In the underdeveloped regions, TSKB's equity participa-
tion has a strong promotional impact, since people who have investible funds
are usually hesitant to subscribe shares, especially those of a new firm, until
they see TSKB participating. Therefore, TSKB plans to play a leading role in
helping new projects to raise equity capital in the underdeveloped regions.
E. Economic Impact
4.17      A thorough review of the economic impact of TSKB's operations was
made by a Special Study Mission in late 1972, using a sample of 23 projects in
various sub-sectors. Based on actual project results rather than estimates



- 15 -
made in the course of TSKB's own appraisals, the quality of these projects was
measured by economic rates of return calculations using international prices
for all traded and potentially traded goods. The economic rates of return
derived in this way for projects in operation in 1971 ranged from negative
(4 projects) to almost 50% (2 projects). The median value was 14%. The
weighted mean was somewhat lower, at about 10%. Any attempt to group these
results into performance categories is bound to be somewhat arbitrary. How-
ever, the economic viability of the six projects with returns of 2% or less
is doubtful. These account for just over 40% of total fixed investment in
the sample of 23 projects.
4.18      There was clearly some room for improvement in appraisal techniques.
Since 1970, TSKB had been calculating effective rates of protection as part
of its appraisal process. Since the major reason for discrepancies between
financial and economic performance of projects in Turkey seems to be the high
and variable protection accorded industrial output, the effective rate of
protection calculation has proved a helpful screening device. Starting
January 1974, TSKB has further strengthened its economic appraisal by calculat-
ing the economic rates of return of the projects. During the first quarter
of 1974, thirteen projects were evaluated by this method. Eleven projects
have economic rates of return ranging from 11% to 39% and the remaining two
projects have rates of 44% and 65%, respectively.                   X
4.19      Since the devaluation of the lira in August 1970, TSKB has financed
an increasing proportion of export-oriented projects, mainly sponsored by
the established clients. Projected annual net foreign exchange savings or
earnings of projects financed by TSKB during 1972 and 1973 amounted to $46.6
million equivalent. These projects belong to various sectors producing
textiles, leather, food products, machinery and metals.
4.20      Actual exports by TSKB's borrowers increased from $45.5 million in
1971 to $69.3 million in 1972 and to $112.2 million in 1973, registering an
average annual growth of 57% compared with the average of 76% for all exports
of industrial products during 1972-73.
4.21      In 1973, some 7,300 new jobs were created by projects financed by
TSKB, compared with 7,000 in 1972, and an average of 3,500-4,000 annually
during previous years. The average investment per job created amounted to
LT 310,000 equivalent per job in 1973, compared with LT 260,000 equivalent
in 1972 and an average of LT 210,000-280,000 equivalent per job the years
before. In real terms, the average costs per job remained stable.
V. TSKBB'S FINANCIAL SITUATION
A. Resource Position
5.01      Summary.  Annex 12 presents TSKB's resource position as of March 31,
1974, and describes the sources of funds. Since its founding in 1950, TSKB
has raised resources totalling LT 5 billion, with equity constituting 8.2%,



- 16 -
local currency loans 11.2%, and foreign currency loans 80.6% of the total.
The Bank Group has provided 51% of TSKB's overall resources. As of March 31,
1974, net funds raised by TSKB were as follows:
Funds                                        LT million       Percentage
Equity                                            411.7            11.3
Borrowings
Local Currency                               529.1            14.5
Foreign Currency                           2,712.7            74.2
Total Funds Available                           3,653.5           100.0%
5.02      Local Currency Resources.  The Government remains the principal
source of domestic resources. As of March 31, 1974, eight loans from the
Government totalling LT 479.1 million were still outstanding, representing
soie 51% of local currency resources outstanding. The share capital in-
crease, approved in 1972, has been completely paid in by the shareholders.
5.03      In 1973 and in the first part of 1974, resource mobilization in
local currency was difficult and remained limited. In an informal under-
standing with the Bank in December 1972, TSKB would endeavor to mobilize
at least LT 350 million from the market either in direct bond issues or in
guaranteed bonds during 1973 and 1974. It was understood that TSKB would
float its own bonds for LT 200 million at a negative spread. In 1973, TSKB
issued TL 50 million in bonds which were fully subscribed. In 1974, the
Board authorized the issue of another LT 150 million, of which LT 50 million
was issued in April 1974. Altogether, as of the end of M4ay 1974, TSKB had
issued bonds totalling LT 100 million and guaranteed bonds for a total of
LT 67.8 million. However, TSKB plans to execute its entire bond issue and
guarantee program by the end of 1974 and thereby meet the target.
5.04      Joint Financing with Commercial Banks.  To supplement resources
needed by its clients, TSKB has initiated a program of joint financing with
commercial banks. Under this program, TSKB appraises a project and presents
its appraisal report to various commercial banks interested in covering part
of the investments. During 1973, TSKB appraised 13 projects for joint fi-
nancing. However, many of the commercial banks which were expected to partici-
pate were unable to do so because of the tight credit situation (see para.
2.05). Consequently, only four projects benefited from this program. Five
companies had to float bonds with TSKB's guarantee, three projects were re-
ferred to IFC for financing, and the remaining project purchased Government
foreign exchange to finance its equipment imports. TSKB is continuing its
dialogue with the commercial banks with a view to accelerating and expanding
the program when the credit situation improves.



- 17 -
5.05      Foreign Currency Resources.  When the last Bank loan of $40 million
was extended to TSKB in December 1972, TSKB was expecting to raise funds from
the following sources during 1973-74:
Source of Funds                            US$ million
EIB (two loans)                                 30
KfW (two loans)                                 16
International Capital Markets                  32
Since then, TSKB has received one loan each from EIB and KFW amounting to 15
million units of account ($18 million) and DM 25 million ($9.6 million), re-
spectively. In addition, IFC in conjunction with the Industrial Bank of Japan
extended a loan of $10 million, which paved the way for TSKB to raise funds
independently in the international capital markets. Since the beginning of
1974, however, in the light of the increased cost of capital in the interna-
tional markets, the Government has not encouraged TSKB's efforts in this
direction. As of August 30, 1974, TSKB's foreign exchange commitments have
exceeded the available resources by approximately $10 million. TSKB expects
further loans from KfW (DM 30 million or $12 million) and EIB (20 million
units of account or $24 million) to become effective in the second half of
1974, and has obtained Government permission to raise $25 million in the in-
ternational capital markets.
B. Quality of Portfolio
5.06      General.  As of March 31, 1974, TSKB had a total portfolio of about
LT 3 billion, broken down as follows:
LT million         %
Equity Participation                         169.1             5.7
Local Currency Loans                         564.5            19.2
Foreign Currency Loans                     2,214.8            75.1
Total Portfolio                       2,948.4          100.0
This represents an increase of 44.5% since December 31, 1972.  The outstand-
ing loan portfolio by industry and the equity portfolio as of March 31, 1974
are given in Annexes 13 and 14, respectively. Generally, TSKB's portfolio is
well diversified and sound.
5.07      Loans in  Arrears.  Annex 15 shows the arrears situation for the
period 1970 through March 31, 1974. As of December 1972, the total out-
standing amount of principal on which there were arrears over three months
was LT 145.1 million and represented some 7.7% of the loan portfolio.



- 18 -
5.08      In 1973 and 1974, the situation gradually worsened and as of
March 31, 1974, the total outstanding amount of principal on which there were
arrears over three months was LT 276.2 million, about 10% of the loan portfolio.
5.09      Total arrears as of March 31, 1974 reached LT 104.2 million, including
LT 55.9 million of principal arrears, and LT 48.3 million of interest arrears.
The main explanation for the rate of delinquent loans is related to the rigidity
of the interest rate structure in Turkey. Since TSKB has been charging the
legal ceiling rate on its loans, any penalty interest on late payments is
illegal; this advantageous situation, given the comparatively low cost of
money lent by TSKB, is intentionally utilized by clients (a) to delay repay-
ments, and (b) to use the money for working capital purposes.
5.10      The mission has discussed this problem with TSKB's management, and
has been assured that adequate steps will be taken to tighten the control
over collections.
5.11      Provisions for possible losses on loans amounted to LT 23.1 million
as of March 31, 1974, compared with LT 27.1 million as of December 31, 1972.
At the end of each year, TSKB's management reviews the portfolio closely. At
the end of 1973, TSKB's management felt no need to increase the provisions.
Since almost all of TSKB's loans are well secured, the provisions can be
considered adequate. This judgment is confirmed by the auditors.
5.12      Equity  Investments.  Of the 34 companies in which TSKB has invested,
as of March 31, 1974, eight were under construction, four were operating at
a loss, and two were in liquidation. Adequate provisions and guarantees have
been made for possible losses.
5.13      Among the 20 companies which were operating profitably, 17 paid
dividends in 1973. TSKB's dividend yield on its dividend-earning investments
was 23.5% and the overall dividend yield on the entire portfolio was 9.9%.
The average book value of TSKB's equity portfolio as of March 31, 1974 was
162% of par value. TSKB has made loans to 26 of the 34 companies, totalling
LT 535.4 million as of March 31, 1974, or 24.2% of its loan portfolio.
C. Financial Performance and Position
5.14      Audited income statements and balance sheets for 1970-1973 and
provisional figures as of March 31, 1974 are in Annexes 16 and 17.
5.15      Income Statements - Profitability.  TSKB's earning performance,
which historically has been good, improved further in 1973. Profits after
tax and provision in 1973 (LT 72.3 million) were 42% higher than in 1972
and yielded 21% of the average net worth, compared with 18% in 1972.
5.16      Administrative expenses have increased rapidly in recent years (27%
in 1973), mainly due to the salary bill increase. However, as a percentage
of average total assets, administrative expenses decreased from 1.6% in 1971
to 1.4% in 1973.



- 19 -
5.17      TSKB paid a 15% dividend in 1972 and 1973, amounting each year to
about 44% of net profit. The dividend yield on the average market price of
TSKB's shares was 10% in 1973, compared with 6% in 1972.
5.18       Balance Sheets - Financial Position.  TSKB's total assets increased
by 40% in 1973, due mainly to the increase in loan portfolio. As of March 31,
1974, total assets amounted to LT 3.4 billion. The loan and equity portfolios
represented 81% and 5% of the total assets, respectively, and the total liquid
funds amounted to LT 0.27 billion, or 8% of the total assets. The long-term
borrowings were 80% of the total liabilities and amounted to 7.3 times net
worth as of March 31, 1974.
5.19       The debt/equity ratio calculated according to the definition in the
last Loan Agreement with the Bank was 4:1 at the end of 1973, against the
maximum limit of 5:1. The book value of a TSKB share was 195% of par as of
December 31, 1973.
VI. TSKB'S PROSPECTS
A. The Environment
6.01      There was a slight slowdown in investment in the private sector
during 1974, caused in part-by a reduction in available credit as a result of
restrictive policies adopted to combat inflation, and in part by price in-
creases for imported capital goods and construction materials. At the same
time, these higher import prices together with the increased cost of petroleum
and a reduction in the volume of Turkey's exports, have put the balance of
payments under increasing pressure. The external side is further clouded by
reduced prospects of maintaining the high level of foreign exchange remittances
by Turkish workers abroad, especially if the recessionary tendencies now
evident in Western Europe become stronger.
6.02      Political developments during the past year have also led to some
uncertainty and hesitation in the private sector. Business appears to have
been affected in part by uncertainty as to the nature of the economic policies
towards the private sector of the coalition government headed by Prime Minister
Ecevit, which took office in January 1974. The collapse of the coalition in
mid-September, 1974, and the subsequent difficulties in forming a new govern-
ment, despite pressing economic and foreign policy issues, have contributed
to further uncertainty.
6.03      Nevertheless, the overall prospects for investment and business in
the private sector remain reasonably good, provided a solution to the political
difficulties emerges in the near future and steps are taken to deal with urgent
economic problems. In addition, the reactivation of rediscount facilities as
well as the relaxing of reserve requirements with the Central Bank at the end
of August 1974, and the increase in corporate bond ceiling rate from 15% to
18% in mid-December, 1974, should ease some of the difficulties of financing



- 20 -
industrial investment which business experienced in the first half of 1974.
In light of these developments, private investment in manufacturing can be
expected to grow at the rate of some 15-20% a year in real terms during the
next two years.
B. TSKB's Strategy and Forecast of Resources and Operations
6.04      Over nearly a decade, TSKB has been operating under one major con-
straint:  it has not had enough resources to meet demand from private entre-
preneurs, both for domestic and foreign procurements. If TSKB had the re-
sources, it could probably, as a minimum, maintain its recent share in financ-
ing, i.e. 18% of imports for private fixed investment in the manufacturing
sector and about 9% of local currency investment. Private investment in
manufacturing is expected to grow over the next two years (para. 6.03). Demand
for TSKB financing will likely remain high and will continue to grow at a
rapid pace. TSKB can look to substantial growth in its operations, both in
local currency and foreign exchange, without impairing project standards. As
before, TSKB's projections over the next two or three years are likely to
remain a function of resources.
TSKB's Strategy for 1975-1976
6.05      TSKB in consultation with the Bank, has formulated a strategy with a
view to accelerating its resource mobilization and strengthening its opera-
tions for the next two years. An outline of the strategy is included in
Annex 17 a.
Forecast of Resources
6.06      TSKB expects to mobilize, during the period September 1974-December
1976, LT 4.1 billion (about $300 million equivalent) in foreign exchange and
about LT 1.5 billion in local currency (including retained earnings). The
underlying assumptions are summarized and analyzed below:
(a) Foreign exchange: As of August 31, 1974, TSKB had overcommitted
approximately $10 million. For the remaining four months of 1974,
TSKB's foreign currency loan commitments amount to approximately
$46 million. Two new loans from EIB and KfW totalling $36 million,
together with the resources ($25 million) to be raised in the
international capital markets for which Government permission
has been obtained, will be used against these commitments. As
of the end of 1974, the uncommitted balance of foreign currency
funds will be around $5 million. During 1975-1976, TSKB's
foreign currency commitments are estimated to be $247 million.
TSKB hopes to receive three loans from KfW amounting to $36
million, and two loans from EIB amounting to $30 million. It
has also obtained the Government's permission, in principle,
to raise $100 million in the international capital markets,
subject to terms and conditions being acceptable. To raise



- 21 -
such a sizeable amount in the foreign markets, IFC's further
assistance will probably be needed and solicited. All poten-
tial foreign exchange mentioned would add up to $171 million,
and the net foreign exchange resource gap will be of the order
of $76 million. The proposed Bank loan of $65 million will
enable TSKB to close most of the resource gap.
(b)  Local currency:  The uncommitted balance of local funds avail-
able as of August 31, 1974 was around LT 5 million. By the
end of 1976, TSKB expects to increase its share capital by
LT 125 million and to generate cash from its operations for
about LT 825 million. TSKB expects its local currency loan
and equity commitments during September 1974 - December 1976
to reach LT 1,480 million. The resource gap in local currency
will have to be filled by additional bond issues. During loan
negotiations, TSKB indicated that it will endeavor to mobilize.
LT 1,100 million in 1975-1976 through bond issues, share capital
increases and joint financing with commercial banks. At least
60% of the above will be in the form of bond issues and share
capital contributions.
Forecast of Operations
6.07      Based on the above resource forecasts until the end of 1976, which
have been extended through 1979, TSKB expects to reach an overall commitment
level of LT 16.8 billion during 1975-79 (Annex 18). Given this projected
volume of business, TSKB's contribution to private fixed investment, on
disbursement basis, would average 9.3% for the next two years. TSKB's share
in the foreign exchange component of the fixed investment would be 16.5%. The
yearly rate of increase in loan commitments shows a decline from 30.2% in
1976 to 13.1% in 1979 for foreign currency loans and from 29.7% in 1976 to
14.9% in 1979 for local currency loans. Equity investments are expected to
rise at an average of 20% per year and reach LT 149.3 million in 1979, compared
with LT 50.8 million in 1973.
6.08      Projected Geographical Distribution of Operations.  TSKB tentatively
estimates the share of its commitments of loans and equity in the underdevel-
oped areas of Turkey 1/ to reach 40% of TSKB's overall operations in 1975
and 60% in 1976, amounting to LT 0.8 billion and LT 1.6 billion, respectively.
This represents the maximum possible given the industrial context of these
areas and the fact that the pipeline of the projects eligible for TSKB financ-
ing is still limited.
6.09      Utilization of the Proposed Loan.  TSKB is determined to expand its
promotional activities and lending and equity investments in the underdeveloped
regions in line with the Government policy, so as to reduce the regional
1/   As defined by SPO in the 1974 Annual Program (see Map in Annex 3).



- 22 -
imbalance in income and employment opportunities. As TSKB increases its
activity in the underdeveloped regions, more resources need to be allocated
for projects in these regions. In line with this objective, at least 50% of
the proposed Bank loan will be used to finance investments in the underdevelop-
ed regions. This target will enable the Bank to perform a useful monitoring
role at this stage by reviewing a reasonable number of sub-projects to be
financed by TSKB and further encourage TSKB to maintain and accelerate the
progress achieved in the past two years in developing projects in the under-
developed regions.
6.10      TSKB plans to withhold financing of any projects in the developed
regions whose sponsors have access to other sources of funds. For the projects
in the developed regions which qualify for TSKB's financing, the Bank should
encourag2 TSKB to finance them jointly with other institutions in Turkey and
abroad. Therefore, the Bank recommends that the proposed Bank loan be used
to finance only a part of the foreign exchange costs of large-size projects in
the developed regions. It was agreed that the Bank's participation should be
limited to US$1 million plus 30% of the foreign exchange cost over and above
this amount. Under this formula, for a project requiring US$5 million foreign
exchange, TSKB's contribution would be a maximum of US$2.2 million, or 44%
of the total requirement.
6.11      Following the above criteria, the average size of TSKB sub-projects
financed with Bank funds is not likely to increase, and may even decrease.
In order to enable the Bank to review a sufficient number of TSKB's sub-proj-
ects, the present free limit of US$1 million should remain unchanged under
the proposed Bank loan. As in the last loan, the aggregate free limit should
not exceed 30% of the loan amount.
C. Projected Financial Situation
6.12      Projected Profitability.  Projected income statements for the years
1974-1979 are included in Annex 19. Assumptions for the projections are in
Annex 22. With these assumptions, TSKB's overall spread will be around 3.2%
in 1975 and drop to an average of 1.9% in 1976-1979.
6.13      TSKB's profits after tax are expected to grow from LT 86.6 million
in 1974 to LT 144.7 million in 1979. Unless the lending rate ceiling is
raised,the rate of return on average net worth would decrease from 21.5% in
1974 to 16.9% in 1975 and then to 14.2% in 1979. Administrative expenses
are forecast to decrease from 1.6% of average total assets in 1974 to 1.1%
in 1979. TSKB proposes to increase its share capital in 1975, 1977 and 1979
by LT 125 million each time. The dividend pay-out ratio will fluctuate
between 37.5% and 58.3%. On the basis of the projected dividend policy,
the book value of a TSKB share will fluctuate between 192% and 222% of par
value.



- 23 -
6.14       Financial Position.  Projected balance sheets through 1979 (Annex 20)
show an increase in TSKB's total assets from LT 4.1 billion at the end of 1974
to LT 15 billion at the end of 1979. TSKB's total portfolio is forecast to
increase from LT 3.5 billion in 1974 (86% of total assets) to LT 14.5 billion
in 1979 (96% of total assets). Long-term debt will grow from LT 3.3 billion
in 1974 to LT 14.0 billion in 1979. The long-term debt to equity ratio (in-
cluding guarantees) is projected to fluctuate between 8.0;1 and 12.7:1. The
debt/equity ratio as defined in the Loan Agreement will increase from 4.4:1
in 1974 to 6.4:1 in 1976 and to 9.7:1 in 1979, this being due to the fact that
TSKB will rely mainly on additional borrowings to meet its demand. TSKB's
continuing good record of operations should permit raising of its debt limit,
as now defined, to six times equity. Since this limit will be exceeded by the
end of 1976, TSKB is prepared to increase its share capital in 1976 instead of
1977 as originally scheduled. Should a 6:1 debt/equity limitation still be
in jeopardy, the alternatives are (a) TSKB's curtailing its expected opera-
tions, or (b) the Bank's considering whether a more liberal debt/equity limit-
ation would be justified.
6.15       Reserves and provisions for possible losses will grow from LT 271.8
million at the end of 1974 (7.2% of TSKB's portfolio and guarantees) to LT
691.1 million in 1979 (4.7% of portfolio and guarantees).
6.16      Projected cash flow statements for the period September-December
1974 and the entire years 1975 through 1979 are in Annex 21. The average
debt service coverage will be 1.14 times in 1975-1979, and interest coverage
is forecast to be 1.33 times, which are adequate.
VII. THE PROPOSED LOAN - OBJECTIVES AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      The success of Turkish economic plans in sparking off a rapid
growth in the private industrial sector has been impressive. Since the
First Five-Year Plan started in 1963, there has been a conscious shift in
emphasis towards investment in Turkey's manufacturing industries. The
primary economic policy is how to preserve this new dynamism in the economy
and focus more on reducing the geographical imbalance in income and employ-
ment opportunities. There is also a strong recognition of the need for
greater integration with the world economy and the need for Turkish business-
men to meet the challenge of external competition. An important input for
achieving this will be an adequate supply of medium- and long-term capital,
in local currency and foreign exchange, to assure the implementation of
industrial projects in developed and underdeveloped regions. TSKB has been
an effective intermediary to channel long-term funds to viable projects in
the past. Its developmental role in the future is expected to enlarge since
it is now geared for deeper involvement in developing and financing projects
in the underdeveloped regions. In this context, the loan to TSKB for finan-
cing the imports of capital goods needed by industries is justified. How-
ever, we should continue to encourage TSKB to achieve more diversification
in its resource mobilization. Therefore, in order to induce TSKB to mobilize
resources outside the Bank, KfW and EIB, a Bank loan of $65 million is recom-
mended, leaving approximately $135 million to be raised from other sources.



- 24 -
7.02      However, it should be clear that TSKB cannot meet its role in
financing meritorious development projects without access to adequate re-
sources which can be raised at a positive spread. A further change in
Turkey's interest rate regulations is not a realistic recommendation for
this loan; the Bank should continue to have a dialogue with the Government
in this respect.
VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS AND UNDERSTANDINGS REACHED
8.01      TSKB, despite the previously noted imperfections in Turkey's in-
terest rate regime, and the consequences thereof for TSKB's role as an effec-
tive mobilizer of resources, continues to be a suitable and creditworthy
borrower of the Bank. It is expected to continue to play an important role
in financing private industry in Turkey, having financed about 9% of totai
private industrial investments and about 18% of imported equipment needed by
the private sector from 1967 through 1973. TSKB deserves the Bank's con-
tinued support, especially in view of its resolution to vigorously promote
industrial development in the underdeveloped regions. A Bank loan to TSKB
in the amount of US$65 million, covering approximately one third of TSKB's
foreign exchange resource gap over the next two years, is appropriate. Under
TSKB's adopted policy of concentrating on investments in the underdeveloped
regions of Turkey, about 60% of all its resources will be allocated to projects
in such regions in 1975 and 1976. Moreover, TSKB will use at least 50% of
the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan for financing projects located in these
regions.
8.02      The terms of the loan should be those normally applied to loans to
dfcs, including the standard commitment charge. TSKB's continuing good record
of operations should permit the raising of its debt/equity ratio from 5:1 to
6:1 (para 6.14).
8.03      During loan negotiations, the following agreements were reached:
(a)  TSKB's net spread on the proposed Bank loan will be limited
to 2-1/2% with the balance to be paid to the Government as
guarantee fee (para 4.08);
(b)  TSKB will limit the use of the proceeds of the Bank loan, in
financing the foreign exchange requirements of projects lo-
cated in the developed regions, to $1 million plus 30% of
the foreign exchange cost of each project over and above
this amount (para 6.10).
8.04      In addition to the above, the following informal understanding
was reached: TSKB will endeavor to raise in international capital markets
an estimatet $100 million equivalent (in addition to the $25 million already



- 25 -
authorized by the Government) during 1975 and 1976. For local currency
resources, TSKB will mobilize at least LT 1,100 million through (i) issuance
of bonds, (ii) expansion of share capital, and (iii) joint operations with
commercial banks. At least 60% of the above lira resources to be mobilized
will be in the form of bond issues and share capital contributions. For
raising resources in the international capital markets, TSKB is seeking IFC's
assistance (para 6.06).

TURKIYE SINAI KAIKINMA BANKASI A.S.
Incentives Applied to Investments in Manufacturing Sector
1.  Exemption From Customs Duties:
According to the Government Decree of 6/12585 dated 10.28.1969
investments which satisfy the conditions given below are exempted from all
customs duties. The conditions are:
- The investment should enable the production of goods which would be
competitive in world markets.
- The investment should be set up with a capacity comparable to
those in developed countries.
- The investment should introduce a new production technology.
2. Customs Tax Deferment:
The taxes that are defered are the customs tax, production tax
on imports, municipality share on customs and quay duty. Stam,p duty is not
defered. According to the 1974 General Promotion Table, the taxes are paid
in minimum 2, maximum 5 yearly installments varying according to the sector.
In the GPT if a sector is eligible for both customs duty exemption and customs
tax deferment   the final choice would be made by the Ministry of Industry and
Technology.
3. Income and Corporation Tax Rebate on Investments:
The basic rebate is equal to 30% of the equity capital. It increases
to 40% for agricultural projects and 50% for investments in underdeveloped
areas which are included in the list published in the annual programs of deve-
lopment plans. According to the Income and Corporation Tax laws, accrued
income and corporation taxes are not paid in the first 5 years of the opera-
tions till the total accrued tax amount reaches 30 - 50 % (according to the
type of operation) of the equity capital.
4. Medium Term Investment Loan and Interest Subsidy:
According to the government decree 7/5822 dated 3.1.1973 the commercial
banks will extend medium term loans for the duration of 5 years, at 12% rate of
interest if supplied by the banks' own resources. In this case borrowers in
priority sectors are elegible for a Government interest subsidy at a rate of 6%
from the Selective Credit Fund. The rate of interest subsidy for projects in
underveloped areas is 7%.



Annex 1
Page 2
The banks may apply to the Central Bank for discount. For export-
oriented   investment projects, ship building and ship-yard projects, the
maximum rate of interest to be applied is 10.5% if the credit is met by Central
Bank resources.   In this case the rate of interest subsidy is 4.5% and 5.5%
for projects in underdeveloped areas.
5. Private Foreign Capital:
In the 1974 Annual Programme authorization of private foreign capital
is listed as an incentive for the first time in the General Promotion Table.
According to the decree 7/5399 which is published in The Official
Gazette dated January 3, 1974, the Ministry of Finance is authorized to
give permissions for private foreign capital. -Only the sectors which are
listed in the GPT are permitted to benefit from this incentive.   The amount of
credit to be obtained may not exceed 60% of the total investment. This ratio
is8O% for projects in underdeveloped areas. For shipbuilding the ratio is 95%
and 90% for imported vessels.
The term of credit may not be less than 2 years.
The rate of interest may not be more than 1 above the interest rate
applicable in the Euro-Market at the time of procurement of the credit.
If the rate of interest of the private foreign capital is less than
12% (the maximum rate applied to credits in Turkey) then the difference of
interests is collected by the Central Bank.
6.  Exemption from Construction Tax:
According to Article 67 of the Law No. 1318 published in the
Official Gazette of August 10, 1970, construction of plants is exempted from
construction tax. This is a general incentive; so it is not listed as an
incentive in the General Promotion Table.

TURKIYE SINAI KALKINMA BANKASI A.S.
Statements of Policies
I.        Statement of Operational Policies Adopted in June 1950
lo        The Industrial Bank is a private institution which, though it will
consider the Government's plans for the national economy, will make decisions
on the basis of what is best for the health and activity of private enter-
prises.
2.        The factor of primary importance in the Industrial Bank is not its
financial resources but the technical services through which its financial
aid will be made effective.
3.        The Bank should have a first-class technical staff whose head and
nucleus must be sought abroad. It will make investments only after full
examination of applications by this staff.
4.        In selecting enterprises to be financed, the Bank will observe the
following criteria:
a. Production of goods of benefit to the Turkish economy;
b. Soundness of the enterprise;
c. Quick realization and profitability of the enterprise; and
d. Desirability of geographical distribution of investment.
5.        The Bank will keep its interest rate as low as possible consistent
with the payment of its dividends and the accumulation of necessary reserves.
It may also charge a percentage of the profits of the financed enterprise in
return for the services of its technical staff.
6.        The Bank's financing may be in the form of loans, participations,
or both; the last is preferable in appropriate circumstances. Wherever
possible, the client should provide at least 50 per cent of his capital.
7.        The Bank will lend foreign exchange only for imports of equipment.
In order to make best use of its foreign exchange, it should seek, insofar
as possible, to apply for use of the Government's own foreign exchange re-
sources.
8.        The Bank will obtain adequate security on its loans; require the
keeping of adequate records and the use of sound accounting procedures; and
obtain rights of inspection and audit and, in the event of faulty management,
of intervention in the enterprises it finances.
9.        The Bank will seek to sell its participations to the widest public
and at the earliest moment practicable0



Annex 7
Page 2
lO.       The Bank will seek to interest foreign capital in investment in
Turkey.
11.       The Bank should use its influence in trying to improve government
administration relating to business so as to better the working conditions
and so the confidence of all private enterprise.
II.        Policy Resolution No. 642/6 Adopted on January 5, 1963 and Amended
on October 28, 1966 (Resolution No. 8h8/1) and on September 21, 1973
Resolution No. 1097/1).
1.        For the purpose of avoiding unnecessary duplications of investment
in the public and private sectors the Bank wiU keep regular and continuous
contact with the State Planning Organization through the Economic Research
Department.
2.        In order to ensure a widespread distribution of its investment
risks the Bank will follow the following policies:
(a) Not more than l5% of the Bank's equity and outstanding balance
at any time of the Government Loan, dated F-bruary 18, 1966, shall be commi-
tted to one single real person or corporate body for investment in the form
of a loan, capital participation or under any other form.
(b) No participation shall be taken in the capital of one single
company in an amount exceeding in the aggregate 5% of the Bank's equity and
outstanding balance at any time of the Government Loan, dated February 18,
1966.
(c) The Bank shall not purchase the shares of any company corre-
sponding to more than 25% of its subscribed capital; provided, however, that
the purchase of the shares corresponding to 50% of the shares already sub-
scribed for by the Bank in the event that the new shares to be issued by any
company cannot be sold when the Bank acts as an underwriter shall constitute
an exception to the provision of this paragraph.
(d) The total of the Bank's equity investments shall not exceed its
paid-in share capital and reserves.
(e) The Bank will try to find partners such as IFC or similar in-
vestors to participate in the financing of large manufacturing projects to be
realized by private sector.
The provisions of b, c, and d, do not apply to shares received in
exchange for debit in a liquidation or reorganization or to conversion of
debt into shares necessary to protect the Bank's interests.
This resolution will not be amended without the prior consent of
IDA.
3.        The economic criteria to be applied on investment loans is amended
as follows:
Priority shall be given to projects which:
(a) have a positive influence on the balance of payments of Turkey,



Annex 7
Page 3
(b) have a high ratio or value added to investment, or
(c) promise reduction in costs and selling prices and/or
improvement in the quality of products, or
(d) are of importance from the standpoint of the realization
of the production targets set forth in the Development Plan.
III.       Policy Resolution No. 890/6 Adopted on July 27, 1967
1.         Considering that loans under the level of TL 250,000 are not
profitable with the exception of certain maturities, that such loans uselessly
keep busy the technical services of this bank and consequently delay the
investigation of products which are more useful for the country's economy, to
take effect as from the date of this resolution:
(a) Except for the additional loans required by the projects which
have been financed by this bank and which are at the stage of construction
and for such regions whose development is envisaged within the framework of
the plan targets and strategy, requests for loans made from other regions in
foreign exchange and/or Turkish lira below the level of TL 250,000 shall
hot to be taken into consideration;
(b) No lcaanLs belcw the level of $50,000 shall be approved from
the loans obtain from such external sources as the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, the International Development Association,
The European Investment Bank and the United States Agency for International
Development with the exception of the additional loans necessary for the
cowpLeticn of the projects which have been financed from these sources;
(c) No minimum limit shall be fixed for the foreign exchange
allocations against payment of counterpart in cases where such limit may
interrupt the operation of the existing plants, whereas, applications for
foreign exchange allocations, against payment of counterpart for a new
investment, which are lower than $25,000 shall not be taken into consideration;
(d) The lending from the Thrkish lira resources of the counterpart
in Turkish liras of foreign exchange allocations to be made from the quota in
amounts higher than $50,000 to the extent that the foreign resources would not
permit a loan shall be restricted to such cases where the insufficient financial
resources of the entrepreneur would make such lending necessary and compelling.
IV.        Policy Resolution No. 905/2 z*pt-ted November 9, 1967 =zending
the 1963 Resolution on Economic Criteria to be applied in Investigating
Applications for financing
1.         In order to avoid the creation of idle capacity in the economy and
hence, a waste of capital, priority be given to projects with high rates of
using the productive capacity.



Annex 7
Page 4
2.         Efforts be made for ensuring a harmony  with the annual programs of
the Development Plan in the outlines of the distribution of our resources
among the branches of industry.
3.         In the processing of the projects, the cost of the finished products
which would be calculated at the rate of exchange as applied by the State
Planning Organization in project evaluation be compared with the world prices
and priority be given to those projects which show an export potential, which
can survive without protective measures, and which can compete with the
minimum protection, respectively.
V.         OperationPolicies Resolution No. 10991 Adopted on October73
1.         In the light of the conditions changing in parallel with the economic
and industrial development of Turkey, the main policies and the operational
principles of Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi A.S. have been determined as
follows:
(a) The Bank, in its investment activities, shall not limit itself
to the requests to be made but rather exert efforts in creating the demand
for such investments.
(b) The Bank shall continue to engage in development banking and
investment banking activities at the same time.
(c) The Bank shall promote investments in the under-developed regions,
ensure such investments, develop the concept of project preparation and encourage
the emergence of new entrepreneurs in all the regions of the country.
(d) The Bank shall engage in medium or long-term financial opera-
tions in accordance with the normal market conditions concerning the invest-
ments within its operation field and play the role of financing leader and
financial intermediary for projects requiring joint financing.
(e)  The Bank shall be in steady collaboration with the domestic and
foreign institutions which are related to its objectives and activities and
shall try to secure the maximum amount of assistance from these institutions
in order to realize its objectives.
(f)  The Bank shall get closely acquainted with the institutions
related to its activities and with the pctential entrepreneurs.
(g) The Bank shall guide and assist the entrepreneurs in project
preparation and development, and, during the realization of the projects which
it has approved and when necessary, shall act as joint entrepreneur.
(h) The Bank shall, when necessary, contact the entrepreneurs during
the preparation stage of the projects, extend the project appraisal activities
over the project preparation period so that when the preparation stage
terminates most of the project appraisal results will be available and the
period for the financing decision shall be cut down to a minimum in order not
to inconvenience the entrepreneurs.



Annex 7
Page 5
(i) The Bank shall closely follow the developments in the sectors
and sub-sectors with which it has relations and, as a result of these studies,
make investment estimates for these sectors.
(j) The Bank shall interpret the concept of private industry in
its broad sense so as to include the tourism and services sectors and shall,
when necessary, modify its statatesto include the objectives concerning them.
(k) The Bank shall every year determine its objectives for the
next year, plan the necessary activities to achieve these objectives and
prepare thesein the form of annual programs. The first experimental program
will be prepared for 19740
VI.        Policy Elaboration Adopted on June 7, 1974
1.         The Bank finances those investments which conform with the targets
of the Plan, and which are implemented by enterprises that do not have the means
and possibilities of securing all of the resources from the local and foreign
capital markets.
2.         In the allocation of its resources, the Bank gives priority to the
implementation of industrial investments in the underdeveloped regions and to
the implementation of new projects.
3.         The Bank provides assistance in preparing projects, promotes already
identified projects and, if necessary, participates in the share capital of
projects in underdeveloped regions.
4.         The Bank undertakes sector studies on regional and provincial basis
with the aim of identifying industrial investment opportunities in the under-
developed regions. It designs projects whenever such research indicates
investment opportunities or provides assistance for designing such projects.
5.         The Bank renders the necessary services in order to get potential
investors interested in ideintified projects, to form corporations, and to
secure the participation of additional shareholders. For the implementation
of industrial investments in the underdeveloped regions, the Bank participates
in the share capital up to 25% in addition to loans extended. The purpose for
the Bank's participation is to:
(a) inspire confidence in the regional community so as to secure
their participation in the investment and to act as a coordinator,
(b) complement initially insufficient capital resources,
(c) provide technical and administrative support and extend advice
during the initial pre-operational and operational period, and
(d) sell its shareholdings in the market after the investment is
implemented and a reasonable return on investment is attained.
6.         When the conditions allow, the Bank acts jointly with other financial
institutions to secure the financing of the project.



Annex 7

VII.      Policy Resolution No. 1128/2 Adopted on December 12, 1974
1.        Taking into consideration the objectives of Turkey's economic and
social development as formulated in our Five-Year Plans, TSKB will pursue
policies which will contribute (a) to the competitiveness and export targets
of Turkish industry, (b) to a balanced distribution of investments over the
country, and (c) to spreading the benefits of industrial development over a
wide section of the population.
2.        Since TSKB's resources are limited compared with the overall
financial requirements of Turkish indlustry, in the implementation of the
above policies, its basic principle will be to direct its resources to those
projects which have most need for TSKB's support.
3.        In accordance mith the above-mentioned policies:
(a)  TSKB will carry on its project services as an activity with
a wide scope, ranging from basic research and preparation of feasibility
studies to promotion and implementation of projects,
(b) For the purpose of achieving a balanced distribution of its
loans and investments between regions (as defined in TSKB's administrative
structure) TSKB will prepare annual programs with lending and investment
targets for each region. Within the targets set for each region, priority
will be given to projects in the under-developed areas and effort will be
made to increase the share of TSKB's lending and investment in such area.s.
In this context TSKB defines  under-developed areas as those provinces which
are outside the wcoll-developed parts of the Marmare region, as well as the
relatively developed centers such as Izmir and Adana..
4.       In the implementation of the above policies, sources of finance
outside TSKB, for projects under consideration will be taken into account,
such alternative sources being banks and capital markets at home and abroad.

TSKB's STRATEGY, 1975-1976
(An Outline)
During the next two years (1975-1976), TSKB will pursue the
following strategy in accelerating its resource mobilization and strengthening
its operations:
1.        Resouce Mobilization
TSKB will accelerate its efforts towards resource mobilization, with
a view to playing a more significant role in providing finince to the private
sector. This has been hindered in the past by the regulated interest rate and
by the Government's reluctance to permit TSKB to raise funds in the inter-
national capital markets. TSKB will continue its efforts in seeking Government
authorization to charge a rate high enough to cover its cost so thatt it will
be able to issue more bonds in the domestic market. Government permission is
also required to enable TSKB to maximize its borrowing in international capital
markets. TSKB also expects to receive IFC's assistance in its resource mobili-
zation in these markets.
Apart from loans from international lending institutions and foreign
Government sources, TSKB has undertaken to raise $125 million in the international
capital markets and to mobilize at least LT 1,100 million in domestic resources
through issuance of bonds, expansion of share capital and joint financing with
commercial banks during 1975-1976. At least 60% of the above lira resources to
be mobilized will be in the form of bond issues and share capital increases.
2.        Project Promotion and Resource Allocation
TSKB will continue to expand its promotion program for identifying
and developing projects especially in the under-developed regions of Turkey, in
line -w.ith the current Five-Year Economic Plan. This will include research on
materials, sector and sub-sector studies, pre-project surveys and feasibility
studies. To carry out the work, local and foreign consultants will be employed,
and headquarters and branch office staff will be further strengthened. Close
coordination will be maintained with private and public research institutes,
and Government agencies involved in industrial planning and investments, such
as the State Planning Organization and Ministry of Industry and Technology.
TSKB has prepared a budget for the promotion program for the next ten
years totalling US$6.6 million equivalent.  The expenditures for 1975-1976 ara
estimated at US$1,163,000 which will be disbursed against the Special Promotion
Fknd allocated under the 1973 Bank loan.
In the allocation of its resources, TSKB's Board has passed a resolution
that will give priority to the implementation of industrial p;ojects in the under-
developed regions and to the implementation of new projects. More support will
be; given to thoseenterprises that do not have the means of securing all their



ANNEX 17a
Page 2
resources from the local and foreign capital markets. While the investments
in under-developed regions will increase, TSKB's involvement in developed
regions is expected to be reduced. In line with TSKB's Annual Program for
1975 and tentative estimates for 1976, approximately 50% of all its resources
will be allocated to projects in the under-developed regions in 1975 and 1976.
TSKB will use at least 50% of the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan for
financing projects located in such regions. This would result in a total
commitment of LT 2.4 billion ($170 million equivalent) in under-developed
regions in the same period.
