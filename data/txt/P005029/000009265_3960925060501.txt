PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EGYPT
THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1069-ECT)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Third Education
Project in Egypt, for which Credit 1069-EGT, approved on October 7, 1980
provided SDR 30.3 million (US$40.1 million equivalent) for a project
estimated to cost US$56.93 million. The project was closed two and a half
years later than anticipated on December 31, 1987, and cost US$48.96
million equivalent.   Disbursements continued until October 14, 1988, at
which time SDR 0.16 million was cancelled.
The PCR covers the main points of implementation experience,
paying special attention to the technical assistance (TA) component. It is
based on a report prepared by UNESCO following a completion mission to
Egypt in February 1986 (undertaken prematurely) and subsequently updated in
May and October 1988 by IDA staff based on the findings of a mission and
data collection in March 1988.   Although no PCR was prepared by the
Borrower as had been agreed in Section 3.04 of the Credit Agreement, UNESCO
and IDA missions enjoyed full cooperation of Egyptian authorities.   The
Basic Data Sheet of this PCR includes information not available when the
PCR was prepared, but the differences with the text are minor and do not
affect the assessment of the project.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and its agencies for comment in
August 1989. No comments were received.

upgrading: (i) manpower and skilled worker training; (ii) university education in
agricultural and health sciences; (iii) agriculture workerlfarmer training; and (iv)
university and secondary school teaching skills; and by strengthening the management
capabilities of relevant ministries and institutions (para. 1.02).
Implementation Experience
3.          The bulk of the project was completed as designed, although with major
delays. Some of the completed new training centers were delayed by over 4 years
compared with SAR estimates. Delays were caused by tardiness in site selection and
acquisition, lack of local funds at the appropriate time for payment to contractors,
and slow implementation by poorly organized, Government-operated construction
agencies.   In contrast, private contractors (when appropriate funds were made
available) often completed construction work in advance of the contracted date.
As a result, at project completion only about 60% of the new buildings proposed at
appraisal had been completed, although a further 30% are scheduled for completion
in FY 1990.   Upgrading of existing training centers was more successfully
implemented and about 90% completed (para. 2.01, 2.03 and 2.12).
4.          Technical assistance, a large component of the project, was successfully
implemented and greatly contributed to the attainment of project objectives albeit
at more than twice the originally estimated cost (paras. 2.17-2.34).
Results
5.          As a result of the project, curricula have been revised (para. 2.31),
teaching methods improved (para. 2.30) and more frequent objective assessment
techniques introduced (para. 2.32). This has resulted in an improvement in the
quality of education and training provided by the project institutions due to the
better preparation of teachers and instructors and improvement in curricula and
equipment. In addition there has been a significant increase in the quantity and
quality of skilled and semi-skilled workers produced (paras. 4.08, 4.11, 4.14, and
4.16).

6.          Development and continuation of linkages between overseas educational
institutions and project agencies in Egypt were an important and effective feature
of the project (para. 2.34). This greatly assisted the close integration of two
complementary inputs, namely expatriate expert service and local counterpart
development (para. 2.19).
Sustainability
7.          Sustainability of some components of the project (e.g., at Assuit and
Cairo Universities) may be at risk unless ways are found to increase the recruitment
and retention of laboratory and equipment technicians. This problem is not likely
to be resolved unless employment conditions and remuneration of such technicians
are improved.   Another factor which may effect sustainability of the learning
resource center for medical education at C.U. is the lack of full-time academic
staff (para. 4.23 and 6.04).
Findings and Lessons
8.          The lessons to be learned from the experience of this project include
the following:
(a)   Flexibility in the interpretation and implementation of expert services
enabled the TA component to be closely geared to the requirements of
the project at different stages of development (paras. 2.22, 6.08);
(b)   Attention to training for management aspects of the project at an early
stage was beneficial (paras. 2.27, 6.08);
(c)   The technique of awarding TA to a single coordinating agency which in
turn sub-contracted to specific institutions (rather than recruitment
of experts on an individual basis) proved to be effective, ensuring
coordination and monitoring of the involved institutions and providing
back-up for the experts (paras. 2.20, 6.08);
(d)   Frequent monitoring of and subsequent adjustment to the TA program were
essential and successful features of the project; future projects should
have this element built in from the commencement and include post-
completion evaluation to assess whether job performance has changed as
a result of training (paras. 2.22, 2.27, 6.08);
(e) Failure to complete civil works on timc resulted in serious delays in
project implementation, in future projects greater attention will need
to be given to the timely implementation of the building program (para.
6.05);
(f)   Procurement of equipment was often implemented in advance of completion
of civil works; this resulted in some equipment not being utilized for
some considerable time, while being badly stored with consequent
deterioration of very expensive machinery (para. 6.07);
(g) Procurement of equipment was effectively implemented when a specialist
agency was contracted for purchase, delivery and installation (para.
2.01).

II. Project Implementation
Overview
2.01        The project was in the main successfully implemented and the
majority of the original SAR objectives achieved. The project was originally
scheduled to be completed in four years but took seven. The closing date was
postponed three times from June 30, 1985 to December 31, 1987. Construction
of some training centers was delayed by over four years compared with SAR
estimates mainly because of delays in site selection and acquisition, and lack
of local funds at the appropriate time for payment to contractors. Another
factor was the slow implementation of construction contracts by poorly-
organized, Government-operated construction agencies. This performance
contrasted sharply with that of private construction contractors, who often
completed the work in advance of the contracted date. At project completion
about 60% of the new buildings proposed at appraisal had been completed and
about 90% of the project's existing buildings had been upgraded. A further
30% of the proposed new training centers (TCs) are scheduled for completion in
1989/90. About 70% of the equipment proposed has been installed and is
operational. About 20% of the equipment is in store awaiting completion of
the physical facilities, and about 10% is being utilized in existing TCs prior
to transfer to the new TCs. The procurement of equipment before completion of
civil works is not to be recommended as it has resulted in deterioration and
damage during storage. Initial problems arose in the procurement of equipment
due to the difficulties in specifications and procurement processes. One
implementing agency (MOSA) contracted IIO to provide an equipment procurement
service including installation and start up. This was extremely efficient and
resulted in considerable savings to MOSA. Technical assistance, a large
component of the project, was successfully implemented and greatly contributed
to the attainment of project objectives.1
Proiect Management
2.02        The project (covering three ministries and two universities) was
complex, but each project agency was assigned responsibility for its own
project implementation which proved to be an effective arrangement. It also
enabled IDA staff to liaise directly with project staff in each agency,
thereby simplifying the communications and implementation processes. Capable
and well qualified staff were appointed within the project implementation
units and good relationships were maintained with IDA staff throughout the
project. The overall performance of jlroject Implementation Units' (PIUs)
staff was good and in two agencies benefited from experience gained during
implementation of the two previous IDA credits (681-EGT and 868-EGT).
Although project objectives were achieved, there were some early
implementation problems related too'equipment procurement and technical
assistance contracts, which were later resolved.
1 Details of implementation progress by agency and category are given in
Annexes 1, 2, and 3.



- 4-
Implementation in Project Agencies
2.03        Ministry of Industry and Mineral Resources.  As appraised, the
project provided for construction, furniture and equipment and related TA for
five Vocational Training Centers (VTCs), six mobile units and two industrial
management training centers. Provision was also made for equipment and TA for
11 existing VTCs. Physical implementation has been slow compared with the SAR
estimate, which foresaw completion in August 1984, but the centers are
operating at full capacity in temporary facilities. Of the five new VTCs,
construction of one was completed in 1988, another two are scheduled for
completion in 1989, and a fourth will be completed in 1990. Construction of
the fifth center, originally scheduled to be built at Minia has not yet
commenced because of a decision to change its location to Samaloot.
2.04        All equipment for the 11 VTCs has been delivrered and made
operational in temporary quarters with the exception of -that required for the
Mining Training Center, which is in storage. The centers are functioning at
full capacity with an annual output of about 1,300, as foreseen at appraisal.
A US$0.7 million contract for the purchase of six mobile units has been signed
but the goods have not yet been delivered.
2.05        Construction of the industrial management training renter in Cairo
has been completed. The center is fully equipped and is functioning at full
capacity, as foreseen at appraisal. Construction of the other industrial
management training center, located in Alexandria, has been delayed due to
site acquisition problems. As an interim measure the staff of this center are
conducting training courses in existing training facilities. The combined
annual output of the management training centers in FY87 was approximately
1,100, or close to the SAR estimate of 1,200.
2.06        Ministry of Azriculture.  As appraised this component consisted of
construction of 3 Multi-Purpose and Management Training Centers (MMTC), 1
Poultry Farmer Training Center (PFTC), and 8 Mobile Farmer Training Units
(MFTUs). In addition, equipment and related TA was to be provided to the
above institutions and to a National Veterinary Extension Training Center
(NVETC), 2 Farm Mechanization Training Centers (FMTC), and one Information
Reproduction Center (IRC).
2.07        The three new multi-purpose and management training centers
(MTTCs) provided by the project were constructed, furnished and equipped and
are fully operational. The total output in 1987 from the three MTTCs was only
804 compared with the SAR estimate of 5,000. The shortfall is a result of:
(a) delay in construction of the centers and consequent lack of time for the
cr aters to become established; (b) originally estimated annual attendance of
about 3,200 farmers, which is not likely to start until 1990; and (c) overly
optimistic SAR estimates.
2.08        The new PFTC at Ismalia was completed in 1987 and has been
equipped to enable commencement of training courses in late 1988. The delay
in completion was due to a change in location from Cairo to Ismalia.



2.09        All equipment for the NVETC has been installed and is being
utilized effectively. Training courses for veterinary doctors have been
implemented, with an output in 1987 of 152, which corresponds closely to the
SAR estimate of 150. Female doctors comprised about 15X of this output.
2.10        Equipment for the two FMTCs (at Barrage and Seds) has been
installed and is in use, the combined annual output of trainees is about
1,000, as estimated in the SAR. The farm mechanization program has also been
supported by the purchase of 5 Mobile Training units (not 8 as envisaged at
appraisal).
2.11        The IRC has been completed and equipped mainly as a training
center for the transfer of new technology. This role is extremely important
but differs from that foreseen at appraisal in 1980, which was the preparation
and printing of audio-visual aids and education materials. Courses are
scheduled to commence in late 1988 and will include training in protective
agriculture, modern techniques for land reclamation (by irrigation and use of
greenhouses) and computerized information and management systems.
2.12        Ministry of Social Affairs.  The project provided equipment and
technical assistance for 15 existing handicrafts skills training centers, five
skills training centers for the handicapped and one instructor training center
for women. The procurement of equipment was initially handled by MOSA with
consequent problems. Because of claims by recipient institutions, that items
in the first two contracts were either missing or not to specification, MOSA
decided to confiscate bid bonds, valued at about 5X of the contract amounts
under these contracts. Despite protracted negotiations in which the Bank has
played a mediator role, some of these early contract problems still remain
unresolved. Because of these problems, MOSA decided to hire EQUIPRO, the ILO
procurement department, to organize the remainder of the equipment
procurement.  The use of EQUIPRO greatly facilita'-i the bidding process,
equipment supply and installation. Equipment costs (US$5.8 million) remain
close to appraisal estimates (US$5.6 million). Installation of the equipment
is 85% completed; the remainder is being stored pending completion of the
training centers at Luxor and Aswan.
2.13        The annual output of trainees from MOSA's training centers is
about 1,300 and rising, which compares well with the appraisal estimate of
1,500. The instructor training institute for women has been equipped and
courses are being implemented. Because of shortages of candidates, annual
output of qualified women instructors is only about 10, compared with a SAR
estimate of 50. This is expected to increase as recruitment to the course has
increased from 21 in 1984 to 38 in 1986. However, there is still a high
failure rate of about 50X, which needs to be improved.
2.14        Assiut University.  The project at appraisal made provision for
equipment and technical assistance to help the University develop its
secondary teacher training programs in mathematics and science. All equipment
foreseen at appraisal plus some essential additional equipment has been
received and installed. SDR 3.22 million was disbursed on equipment which is
1.13 million (57X) in excess of the appraisal estimate.



- 6 -
2.15        For the most part the staff have been trained in the use of
equipment. In some cases maintenance problems have been encountered with
respect to sophisticated equipment. In the long term maintenance may pose a
serious problem for the University, particularly because of attrition of
staff, trained in maintenance by the equipment manufacturers.
2.16        Cairo University.  All equipment received has been installed and
is being used as planned in conducting the University's teaching and research
programs. Customs clearance of equipment caused delays but this was
eventually sorted out by PIU management.
Technical Assistance
2.17        The TA provided under the Project, which comprised expatriate
expert services and fellowship programs for local counterpart staff and for
technical staff of the five participating project agencies, was a key factor
in achieving the overall project objectives as mentioned in Chapter I. In
summary, !I the objectives of TA were to develop and improve:
(a)   secondary teacher training in science and mathematics; university
teaching and instruction methodology; and the use and maintenance
of instructional equipment;
(b)   artisan, technical and handicraft skills training;
(c)   farmer training; agricultural extension teacher/instructor
training methodology;
(d)   industrial and management training;
2.18        To achieve these objectives, 257.5 man-months of expert services
and 1,451 man-months of fellowships were utilized. This compares to appraisal
estimates of 258 man-months of expert services and 1,125 man-months of
fellowships. The actual expenditure on technical assistance (US$8.0
million)!' exceeded the SAR estimate of US$5.3 million by US$2.7 million or
52%. The reasons for this are: (i) an increase by 326 man-months of
fellowships over appraisal estimates, which accounts for about US$1.1 million;
and (ii) conservative cost estimates made at appraisal, which were about
US$2,250 per man-. nth for fellowships and US$8,100 per man-month for expert
services. Actual unit costs were about US$3,300 per man-month of fellowship
and about US$12,100 per man-month of specialist services. The increased unit
cost of fellowships was due to the unusually large number of short-duration
training courses, mainly conducted overseas, which not only increased

expenditure on travel but also resulted in higher expenses for logistic
support provided by the host training institutions. The high unit cost for
specialist services is attributed to the multi sub-contracting arrangements
(between Cairo University and universities/institutions in the UK and USA)
which resulted in high overhead charges and administrative costs.
2.19        The design for the provision of TA focussed on the integration of
two complementary inputs, namely expatriate expert services and local
counterpart development. The concerned project agencies identified key areas
where shortages of trained local staff were likely to be crucial to the
implementation of the project and specified detailed TA requirements to
overcome these deficiencies. In the implementation of TA, provision of
experts was always complemented by fellowship training programs for local
staff who would be responsible for project training, and/or implementation.
After completion of the fellowship training, counterpart development continued
under the guidance of experts, who were usually from the same institution
which had provided the fellowship training. This arrangement had a
reinforcing effect on the development of local staff as it allowed continuity
of training in the Egyptian environment for the fellows and provided
opportunity for follow-up by the experts to ensure that the objectives of the
training program were achieved and practiced. The participation of two
expatriate experts in the early design and planning stages of the training
programs for the Faculty of Agriculture of Cairo University were of great
benefit and enabled two very successful training workshops to be organized for
a total of 63 faculty staff, thus achieving a "multiplier" effect. In another
aspect of the design of TA, emphasis was placed on the training of counterpart
staff in procurement, installation and maintenance of equipment and teaching
aids, and on the design and space requirements for workshops, laboratories and
other educational facilities.
Expert Services
2.20        The TORs for expatriate experts were prepared by the participating
project agencies in collaboration with overseas institutions, either directly
or through international or bilateral organizations with offices in Cairo, as
was the case with ILO and the British Council. Visits were made by senior
staff from the participating agencies to the collaborating institutions
overseas to discuss, negotiate and finalize the TORs. This process was much
facilitated in those instances where continuing frequent discussions could be
held in Egypt with the concerned parties (e.g., ILO, British Council) and IDA
supervision missions. The TORs not only defined the qualifications and
experience required of each expert, but also the specific objectives to be
achieved by the experts in a given time frame. In the case of the MOIMR, the
invitation for TA proposals included details of the fellowship program, which
facilitated the selection of experts who had connection with fellowship
training institutions abroad. This enabled the overseas institutions to
prepare individual training programs to match the needs of each participant,
but related to the overall requirements of the Ministry's training program in
Egypt.



- 8 -
2.21        Hiring of experts was in the main carried out using international
or bilateral agencies as intermediaries, a method found to be very effective.
The consultancy teams for the review of programs of study of the CU Faculty of
Agriculture (14 experts) and for the MOIMR mining training project (17
experts) were hired through the British Council. Similarly, the three experts
who assisted in the training of counsellors, instructors and training center
managers for MOSA were provided by the ILO. Assiut University and MOA
obtained the services of short-term experts by direct negotiations.
2.22        During implementation, appropriate changes were made to some job
descriptions, which enabled expert assistance to be more closely geared to the
requirements of the project at different stages of development. For instance,
an initial study of manpower requirements for the mining component (MOIMR) was
made by two experts. After a review of the resulting manpower development
plan, the Government decided to substantially increase expert services and
fellowship provision for this component. In addition, this study enabled
industry to have a direct input into formulation of training programs
according to their needs.
2.23        The provision of a full-time Chief Technical Adviser (CTA) to the
MOIMR to assist in managing mining training component was very beneficial.
The writing of training programs was left to experts located at the mining
training center, while the CTA, based in Cairo, focused on management of
expert services and liaison with the MOIMR. This facilitated smooth
implementation and was very cost-effective, particularly since the mining
trainer center is located a long distance from Cairo.
2.24        Linking payments to consultancy firms according to an agreed
program of achievements was instrumental in keeping TA implementation on time
schedule and maintaining standards. In this connection, more objective
measuring instruments need to be developed to measure performance of experts
during TA implementation.
Fellowship Training
2.25        Under the fellowship program a total of 1,451 man-months were
utilized in providing counterpart training for: (i) educational management,
administration and planning (CU); (ii) technical subject upgrading (CU); (iii)
science teaching methodology (AU); (iv) industrial management (MOIMR); (v)
artisan skills trainers (MOSA); and (vi) specialization in agriculture (MOA).
2.26        Staff selected for training were chosen from a spread of
participating institutions, from different areas of the country, and in the
case of the Universities to give a spread of subject disciplines within
different faculties. A balance was also achieved between senior and junior
members of staff, so that development could occur at all levels within the
institutions.
2.27        Early attention was given to provision of training in the
management and administration of training centers. Periodic monitoring of
fellows performance was carried out and training programs modified



- 9 -
accordingly, although no direct financial provision for this function had been
included in the project. Some of the early training provLded for staff of the
Universities was solely concerned with subject upgrading but as the project
progressed, the original objective for improvement of teaching performance was
realized as the later fellowships concentrated on training in teaching
methodology, curriculum development and methods of assessment.
2.28        The nature of the courses provided varied from highly structured,
formal programs to individualized training courses with a high content of
'hands-on" experience. This enabled both the individual requirements of
fellows and training objectives to be satisfied in most cases.
2.29        At Cairo University (CU), the success of the training was
evidenced by the introduction of improved methods of teaching, better
curricula and more objective assessment of student performance. For instance,
the use of audio-visual aids has increased and more AVA material is being
produced by faculty staff. The practical teaching elements of the courses
offered at CU has increased by the introduction of more clinical practice in
the courses in the Faculty of Medicine and the use of field studies in
science.
2.30        In teaching methodology, emphasis has changed, with a move away
from teacher centered activity to greater student participation and the use of
discussion and small group techniques.
2.31        Some curricula have been revised and advantage was taken of this
opportunity to write the curriculum in an objective format. Faculty staff
have become more sensitive to the needs of industry and have modified courses
to accommodate these suggestions. In pharmacy a new course has been developed
to raise the skill level of graduates. Curricula have also been revised in
the light of results from students' pre-tests, which had illustrated gaps in
prior knowledge.
2.32        There has also been a significant improvement in student
assessment techniques. For example, rating scales have been introduced for
appraisal of clinical performance in the Medical Faculty of Cairo University.
Also examination questions are being prepared to test the course objectives
and not solely content. The use of objective test items to evaluate student
performance has increased. More frequent evaluations are being carried out
than previously to provide students with feedback on their performance and to
improve curriculum and teaching methodology.
2.33        In the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) the nature of the fellowship
training program changed during the project, initially being more
theoretically oriented but since 1983 having a greater emphasis on practical
skills, related to operation and maintenance of equipment in ten different
categories and on skills related to production of greenhouse crops and
irrigation techniques. The use of audio visual teaching materials in the
training of agricultural workers has increased as a result of the training.
Many of the fellows on return to the MOA are initially being used in

management and operational functions but it is intended to utilize them for
more direct training functions in the future.
Institutional Linkages
2.34        Development of linkages between overseas educational institutions
and project agencies in Egypt was an important feature of the project, and
provided reinforcement and continuation of contact after project completion.
Linkages have been established with various institutions in the United Kingdom
and United States. In the case of CU, several faculty members have returned
to link institutions to pursue further studies; there has also been
collaboration in research studies and teaching development. Similarly,
faculty members from the collaborating institutions have visited Egypt to
conduct training workshops and seminars. It is believed that the exchange of
expertise and the working relationships, now firmly established between the
project agencies and the various overseas educational/training institutions
and consulting agencies will provide the basis for continued development of
the training programs in the future.
Covenants
2.35        The Credit Agreement (Section 3.02) included a covenant that the
Borrower shall enter into agreement with qualified institutions for the
provisicn of consultants, specialists and fellowship programs. This covenant
was fully met.
III. Cost and Disbursements
Project Costs
3.01        The total actual project cost is estimated at US$ 48.97 million
which is US$ 7.0 million, or 12 percent below the original estimate of US$
56.9 million. This reduction is almost entirely due to fluctuations of the
SDR: US$ exchange rate, which changed from SDR 1   US$1.323 at appraisal to a
calculated average of SDR 1 - US$1.094 during the period 1981 - 1988. During
this period, this change reduced the value of the Development Credit in US$
terms from US$40.1 million at appraisal to an average of US$33.1 million.
This decrease in credit value was offset by about US$6.0 million lower than
estimated equipment cost (US$28.7 million), which was largely caused by delays
by the MOI in procuring the equipment. Table 3.1 summarizes the estimated and
actual cost by component and by category of expenditure in terms of SDRs and
US$ equivalents.

3.02        Due to changing government priorities, there were some changes in
the objectives for the TA category of expenditure, which resulted in a larger
fellowship program than that envisaged at appraisal (para. 2.17). This
factor, together with higher than estimated unit costs of technical assistance
(para 2.17), caused an over expenditure by SDR 3.15 million on technical
assistance. To compensate for these effects, the credit was reallocated
between the various components and categories on August 1, 1986. The original
SDR allocations and reallocations are shown in Table 3.2

IV. PROJECT OUTCOMES
Overall
4.01        Apart from delays in attainment of all project objectives in two
components; (Mining TC (PVTD) and PFTC (MOA)), the project, as a whole,
achieved its objectives. The problem with the Mining TC was that equipment
procurement and installation was delayed and that, as a result instructors
could not be trained on this particular equipment. Due to involved procedures
in the MOI, procurement of most of the mining equipment was seriously delayed
and this equipment will only be installed just prior to disbursement closure.
This delay has resulted in incomplete training programs for instructors
concerned with new curricula in practical subjects.
4.02        Another constra'nt to the achievement of some objectives has been
the tardiness in implementation of the civil works component particularly in
MOI. The equipment for the incomplete VTCs of the PVTD has been utilized in



- 15 .
existing centers with a corresponding increase in the number of trainees and a
partial satisfaction of component objectives.
4.03        The achievement of project objectives in the various implementing
agencies is discussed below.
PVTD
4.04        In spite of serious delays in completing the construction of new
VTCs, the PVTD has benefitted greatly from the project. The annual output of
trainees from the upgraded project VTCs has increased by about 26X from 1608
(1984) to 2030 (1987). In 1989 due to commencement of courses in 3 of the 5
new TCs, enrollment of trainees will increase by about 500. Two further VTCs
are scheduled to commence training courses in 1990 and 1991 respectively with
a further increase in enrollment of about 330. Due to delays in completion of
the new VTCs, equipment procured for the centers has, in some cases, been
utilized on a temporary basis in non-project VTCs, which has resulted in an
enhanced standard of training in those VTCs.
4.05        A comprehensive study was conducted to assess the training needs
of various industries which resulted in new trade courses being prepared for a
wide range of industries. The quality of courses was improved by:
(a)   extensive curriculum revision,
(b)   introduction of modular courses
(c)   production and use of new teaching materials both for the training
of instructors and for use on trade training courses.
(d)   using modern equipment, computers and teaching aids.
4.06        The project also assisted in the improvement of the training in
non-project VTCs through the dissemination of new teaching methods and
curricula from project institutions to non-project institutions. This formed
a basis for the more effective use of aid from other donors e.g. US AID and
British Council.
4.07        The management of the PVTD became more efficient by the use of a
computerized management information system, which helped by monitoring project
achievements and disseminating good training concepts and practices throughout
the PVTD training network.
4.08        The project increased the efficiency of the trade training system
by training the regional PVTD managers. This resulted in greater
collaboration between the PVTD and the Consultative Training Courncil
established in each Region, and to a greater involvement of industry in the
training process. Better-quality educational and training opportunities have
become available to the less populated areas (e.g. Qena and Damietta) as a
result of the upgrading of 11 VTCs, and this will be further increased with
the completion of the new VTCs in 1989/90.



- 16 -
4.09        The training of local Egyptiatn experts both by fellowship training
and counterpart training enabled them to participate fully in the project.
MOSA
4.10        MOSA's objective to improve the quality of training provided by
its VTCs, training centers for the handicapped and Instructor training center
for women has largelv been met. The management of the TCs has improved due to
training in management techi.iques given to 78 directors and administrators.
Instructor training has improved following overseas training for 23
instructors and in-country training for an additional 73.
4.11        The annual output of trainees from the 13 project VTCs has
increased and is currently about 1,300 compared with the SAR estimate of
1,500. Although there has been a general increase in the number of trainees in
all MOSA VTCs, the 13 project institutions showed a much greater increase in
output (40%) compared with the 31 non-project VTCs (13%).
4.12        Equity has been enhanced by providing a women's instructor
training center, the annual output of which has increased from 22 in 1983/84
to 49 in 1986/87, very close to SAR estimate of 50. Training opportunities
for handicapped persons have increased, and the quality of training has been
enhanced with special equipment for blind and deaf persons. The annual output
of these special centers has increased by about 170.
MOA
4.13        Implementation of this component faced severe constraints due to
several changes of executing agency and management personnel.   The executing
agercy was initially the General Department of Training (GDT) then moved to
the Farm Mechanization Authority and finally transferred to the Under
Secretary of State for Technical Affairs and Ministerial Office. This last
change reflected the need for the development of protected agriculture and
agricultural research both of which are implemented by the Ministerial Office.
Accordingly, the objectives of the component were modified, after consultation
with IDA, to more closely match the changing priorities of Egyptian
agricultural policies.
4.14        The training capacity of the GDT has increased 125% as a
consequence of the project. Three MMTCs and one PFTC have been built and
equipped, and additional equipment has been provided to one VETC and three
TCs. To support these centers 21 instructors have been trained. The number
of training courses has been increased by 30 and an increased output of about
1,100 trainees per annum has been produced as a result of the project.
4.15        Equity considerations have been met by providing training courses
in districts remote from Cairo (e.g. Sohag, in Upper Egypt and Bebbais in East
Egypt). More remote areas are being provided with training opportunities by
means of mobile farmer training units. Five of these MFTUs were found to be
sufficient to cover the training needs of these remote areas compared with the



- 17 -
SAR estimate of 8 units. The MTFUs have been delivered and equipped, and
instructors have been trained under the fellowship program. Training courses,
conducted by tht. MTFUs, are due to commence in late 1988.
4.16        The project has succeeded in introducing higler quality programs
of training to the project TCs, and these have now spread throughout the GDT.
Quality enhancement was achieved by using more sophisticated methods of
training (e.g. learning by doing, use of case studies, greater emphasis on
practical work and use of learning aids in lectures) in contrast with the
previous programs which mainly consisted of lectures. These methodological
changes were achieved as the result of extensive fellowship training programs
and well-directed expatriate expert assistance.
4.17        Due to the change in priorities in the Mechanization Department
and concentration on protected agriculture and controlled growing
environments, training in greenhouse techniques became very important.
Accordingly, the TA and equipment specifications were changed in 1985/86 to
meet these new objectives and as a result two extensions were made to the
original TA agreement.
4.18        Courses are being run in the TCs for:
(a)   operation and maintenance of farm equipment, including
driving courses
(b)   agricultural technicians including administration and finance
(c)   management development
(d)   extension worker skills
(e)   nursery operators.
The numbers trained increased from 1,234 in 1985/86 to 2,347 in 1986/87, the
last complete year for which statistics are available. These numbers will
further increase when the PFTC and greenhouse TCs become operational in 1988.
The trainees produced by the various TCs are utilizing the skills developed to
increase farm productivity particularly where new techniques are being
involved (e.g. mechanization and greenhouse technology) and also for
maintenance of equipment.
Assuit University
4.19        This component involved the upgrading of the quality of teaching
in the schools of science and education at two different campuses (Assiut and
Sohag) of the university. As a result of the project the quantity and range
of teaching equipment has been extended and more modern techniques are being
used in the laboratories. In particular the use of computers as a teaching
aid is a direct result of the project.

4.20        The teaching of both theory and practical subjects has been
enhanced as a result of the fellowship program (48 lecturers for 188
man/months) with an American college, and the exchange between the two
universities has continued to be a source of strength to A.U. Both scientific
and pedagogical subject matter has been upgraded, and students are being
better motivated. Curricula have been revised and teaching techniques
improved. The class sizes for laboratories have been reduced slightly to
permit better practical teaching (staff student ratio 1:12)
Cairo University
4.21        The main objective of this component was to improve university
teaching by providing:
(a)   a university-wide in-service staff development program
(b)   a learning resource center to support health teaching and
(c)   enhanced undergraduate teaching facilities in agricultural
subjects.
These objectives in the main were met by the project.
4.22        As a result of the project the in-service staff development
program was extended in 1985 from 230 to 285 participants per annum. The
program is of three weeks duration and provides training in ed.' ational
techniques, curriculum development, evaluation, and foreign languages. The
quality of the in-service training has improved because (a) there is a better
provision of equipment and (b) the teachers of the course have benefitted from
an extensive fellowship program for training in educational techniques and
evaluation (50 staff members from different faculties for a total of 70
man/months). In addition five staff members were trained in educational
techniques to masters degree level. The overseas training was reinforced by
visiting lecturers from abroad, who assisted in counterpart training and in
delivering the courses at Cairo University.
4.23        A learning resource center for medical education has been
established and is providing staff training through workshops, seminars and
conferences. This training has resulted in (a) better methods of teaching (b)
changes in curricula (c) better assessment of students (d) awareness of the
need to change education to match the needs of the community. The center
develops medical education programs in various media (e.g. video tape-slide
and audio). It also provides a consultancy service for other medical schools
in Egypt as well as a comprehensive library of teaching aids for health
subjects. The center is directed by one part-time staff member and supported
by five technical staff and six administrators. The sustainability of this
center may be at risk unless more full-time academic staff are appointed.
4.24        The project also enabled the Faculty of Agriculture to update its
equipment mainly for undergraduate courses but also for research. The



- 19 -
equipment proved to be useful in introducing students to advanced techniques
in agriculture. Curricula have been modernized to include some of these
latest techniques and consultancies have been established to provide
analytical services to private and government agencies. There is, however, a
problem with regard to provision of suitably-qualified technical staff to
maintain and operate the equipment. Qualified staff are usually not available
at the salaries offered by the Government, and maintenance contracts with
suppliers are too expensive to be financed from the recurrent budget. Within
these limitations the project has been extremely successful in achieving the
SAR objectives. Another factor which has contributed to the improvement in
the quality of teaching has been the planned 12% decrease in the staff/student
ratio, which was achieved through a deliberate reduction in the total number
of enrolled students (from 4,093 in 1983/84 to 3,593 in 1986/87).
V. IDA and Borrower Performance
IDA Performance
5.01        The staffing, timing and frequency of IDA supervision missions
were satisfactory with 14 supervision missions in the period November 1980 to
November 1987, for a total of 39 staff weeks. Technical advice provided by
the supervision, preparation and appraisal missions to the participating
agencies enhanced the capacity for project formulation and implementation. In
addition, extensive in-country supervision was carried out by the
participating TA agencies such as Boston University, ILO, and the British
Council.
Borrower Performance
5.02        Considering the very complex nature of the project. the in-country
management was reasonable (para. 2.02). However, there were some problems
(particularly in the MOIMR) with the preparation of equipment lists and with
the bidding procedures. These procedures have now been modified and it is
anticipated that future procurement will proceed more rapidly. There were
also problems with site acquisition and uncertainty as regards site locations.
This caused considerable delays in the completion of civil works and resulted
in equipment delivery in advance of construction completion. This was very
undesirable as it necessitated equipment storage under adverse conditions,
which caused equipment deterioration and damage prior to utilization. The
management of the TA was in the main very successfully executed. Any problems
which arose were due to either (a) non-completion of training facilities on
due date, or (b) non-procurement of equipment required for TA implementation.
MOSA's use of EQUIPRO as its equipment procurement agency greatly simplified
the in-country management problems associated with procurement on this scale.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
6.01        The project was in the main successfully implemented and the
original SAR objectives achieved. This success, as with the two previous
education projects (Credits 681-EGT and 868-EGT), was due to the particularly
effective and large TA component, as evidenced by:
(a) improvement in teaching methodology, such as increased use of
teaching aids, utilization of clinical and field studies to
reinforce the learning, use of stiudent-centered teaching
approaches and group teaching methods;
(b) more extensive use of modern equipment in practical teaching,
especially in the universities;
(c) introduction of in-service micro-teaching sessions for junior
academic staff;
(d) development of courses more closely related to the needs of
industry and introducing the concepts of behavioral change; and
(e) improved techniques for assessing student achievement using rating
scales and objective testing methods.
6.02        The success of TA was due to a number of factors:
(a) TA was in general undertaken as a comprehensive package, including
experts and fellowships, and implemented by a single agency;
(b) Government and consultancy agencies jointly participated in the
formulation of terms of reference for experts;
(c) expert services were fully integrated with the fellowship program,
and candidates for fellowship studies were carefully selected;
(d) fellowship programs were designed specifically to meet the
individual requirements of the institution or the fellows;
(e) institutional links were established between institutions in Egypt
and those providing training and/or expert services overseas
(twinning arrangements);
(f) early attention was given to the problems of management and
administration of training facilities in Egypt;
(g) payments for expert services were linked to achievement of
objectives;
(h) counterparts trained in overseas institutions usually continued
this training in-country under the guidance of visiting experts,
usually from the same institution;



- 21 -
(i) a manpower planning exercise conducted in the MOIMR, before
deciding on the provision of expert services or fellowship
training programs resulted in improved TA design;
(j) a full time Chief Technical Adviser (mining engineering component)
was appointed and was concerned solely with project management and
coordination, but not with the details of specialist training
programs; and
(k) Egyptian officers of bilateral and multilateral aid agencies
continuously provided project support.
6.03        Due to some delay in the commencement of training programs and
completion of TCs it is still too early to fully assess the impact of the
project. It would be advantageous to make a more comprehensive assessment in
about five years. However, as one of the on-going projects (Loan 2264-EGT)
has PVTD training as a component, it will be possible during supervision to at
least assess the longer cerm impact in that agency.
6.04        One of the problems which has not been resolved during project
implementation is the recruitment and retention of laboratory and equipment
technicians. In both AU and CU this was seen as a major problem in connection
with the operation and maintenance of advanced technological equipment. The
technicians trained by the equipment suppliers under the credit provisions are
now being offered better positions in alternative employment and are leaving
the university. This problem is not likely to be resolved unless employment
conditions and remuneration for such technicians are improved.
6.05        The difficulties and delays experienced in the construction
program for TCs have resulted in many training activities being carried out in
existing premises with consequent overcrowding of facilities. In future
projects greater attention will need to be given to the timely implementation
of the building program.
6.06        Due to the delay in civil works completion, a large quantity of
equipment has been stored awaiting the commissioning of the TCs. This has
been most undesirable as it has resulted in deterioration and damage to
equipment. In future it would be desirable to delay procurement of equipment
until the facilities in which it is to be installed are within six months of
completion.
Lessons Learned
6.07        With respect to hardware, the following lessons can be drawn:
(a)   Procurement of equipment should not be implemented in advance of
completion of civil works, as this may result in equipment
standing idle, stored in inadequate storage facilities with
consequent deterioration of expensive machinery;



- 22 -
(b)   Procurement problems of inexperienc.d borrowers may be minimized
by the hiring of specialist procurement agencies for the purchase,
delivery and installation of equipment;
6.08        The lessons learned from the successful implementation of TA can
be summarized as follows:
(a)   TA is particularly successful when it is provided as a
comprehensive package which includes both experts and fellowships
and which is implemented by a single consultancy agency.
(b)   Linking local institutions with similar institutions abroad
(twinning arrangements) can be very effective and should be
fostered.
(c)   Frequent feedback and monitoring of TA, which were an essential
and successful feature of this project; should be applied to
future projects and should include a post-completion evaluation to
assess whether job performance has changed as a result of
training.
(d)   Flexibility in the provision of TA allowing changes to be made
during project implementation according to the developing
requirements of the project enables a more efficient use of both
fellowships and expert services.
(e)   Early attention to TA management and administration is critical to
overall project success. The utilization of a full-time Chief
Technical Adviser in the MOIMR as an adviser to the local project
manager was in particular instrumental in achieving objectives of
the mining training component.
(f)   Participation of both Government and consultancy agencies in the
formulation of well-developed terms of reference, as in this
project, leads to a more relevant and efficient utilization of
expert and fellowship time and to better project implementation.
6.09        Although the TA component was successful in achieving project
objectives, the following paragraphs indicate how further improvement could be
attained:
(a)   English language proficiency of Egyptian trainees was variable and
in some overseas training the lack of English language ability
decreased the effectiveness of the learning process. Adequate
foreign language training should be built into project design.
(b)   There was a tendency to reduce the duration of training in order
to increase the number of fellowships. Care needs to be exercised
to ensure that the duration of training is sufficient to permit
the full attainment of the training objectives. There was also a
tendency in some implementing agencies to substitute fellowship



- 23 -
training for expert services, which reduced the effectiveness of
in-country counterpart training.
(c)   Ideally, fellowship training and expert participation should
precede equipment specification and installation, so that local
counterparts can contribute to the preparation of detailed
equipment lists relevant to curriculum needs. However, this is
difficult to integrate into project design and needs careful
consideration well upstream in the project.
(d)   In some instances, there was inadequate preparation of fellowship
participants in terms of expected outcomes of their training
programs, relationship of training to the project, personal
agendas and general reading requirements. This aspect of pre-
fellowship briefing is important to ensure successful outcomes of
training programs.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Summary of TA as Provided
Ministry of Industry and Mineral Resources (MOIMR)
1.          International expert services provided by the project through the
British Council and a private company based in England, comprised 89 man-
months for 17 experts and 35 man-months for 9 experts respectively, giving a
total of 124 man-months for 26 experts. In addition, the firm also provided
three-month training for four directors on a Rro bono basis.
2.          At appraisal, only one mining expert was foreseen; however, this
was later revised to include six mining trade experts through the transfer of
funds from the equipment category. Twenty-one man-months of TA were utilized
to develop a curriculum for the mining engineers. Hence a total of 145 man-
months of expert services were utilized instead of the SAR estimate of 56 man-
months.
3.          The expert service input was implemented satisfactorily.  The
selection criteria included careful evaluation of the experts' CV;
professional background and work experience of expert (academic versus on-the-
job training); experts' understanding of the project (MOIMR objectives); and
the cost of the consultant service.
Ministry of Agriculture (MOA)
4.          The original technical assistance agreement signed June 28, 1982,
provided 173 man-months of fellowship and 66 man-months of expert assistance.
On September 3, 1985, at the request of the MOA, the TA agreement
was amended to include a further 90 man-months of fellowship and 36 man-months
of expert assistance, and in October 12, 1986 the agreement was modified
further to provide for a total of 339 man-months of fellowships and 136 man-
months of experts services. In the event the final utilization was as
follows:

6.          The differences in this distribution and that envisaged in the SAR
were due to changing priorities for development within the MOA which resulted
in the MOA proposing a number of changes to the Association including the use
of the remaining TA in the contract for training of local staff in farm
mechanization to which the Association agreed (February 1985). At the same
time the MOA gave assurances that any outstanding technical assistance
required for the MTTCs at Ismalia, Belbeis and Sohag and the veterinary center
at Sers El-Layan will be provided through bilateral or other sources.
7.          In general the TA input encountered some problems of
implementation which caused delays leading to changes in the project sub-
component in the final phase. It seems that there was an apparent
dissatisfaction with the choice of international experts and lack of
determined follow through regarding the fellowship program on the part of the
MOA. However, due to its design, the project was flexible enough to permit
rectifying the situation with a m!nor extension of the implementation period.
Another problem was the reluctance of the MOA to use experts preferring to
send their own staff for overseas fellowship. This is reflected in the
distribution of TA between fellowships and experts as shown below.

Ministry of Social Affairs (MOSA)
8.          The technical assistance program was implemented by the ILO under
a contract signed with the MOSA on April 16, 1981 involving 147 man-months of
fellowship and 16 man-months of expert services. Twenty-two fellows completed
their four months training at the Vocational Training Branch of the ILO in the
Turin Training Center in July 1982. In May 1985, a revised second contract
was signed with the ILO compri8ing 24 m4n-months of expert services which
would be used to organize in-country training for the training for the
training and managing staff of three departments of the MOSA including social
rehabilitation (50) vocational training (100), and social defense (36).
9.          The services of four international and three national experts were
contracted and in-country training was given as below:
(i)   Instructor courses:  Four courses each for a duration of
three weeks were completed and 75 instructors trained.

(ii)    Manager courses:  Three courses were conducted in Cairo with
a total of 55 participants. A similar course was held in
Alexandria with 21 participants.
(iii)    Sgecial courses for the Social and HandicaDned DeDartment:
A bonus for Directors (20) and specialists (30 were held in
Cairo in 1986.
10.         Cairo University implemented its TA program efficiently and
effectively by signing separate agreements and contracts with six different
institutions. In all, about 319 professors, senior and junior lecturers and
researchers participated in the project fellowship program and the services of
20 international experts were utilized at a cost of SDR 1,887,403 or about 92X
above appraisal estimates. Although some of this increase was a result of
depreciation of the SDR value versus the US$. There was also a real increase
in the TA provided as shown in table below.
11.         The successful implementation of the TA input was largely
attributed to a number of international factors. Fi:st and foremost was the
ability to clearly identify the kind of expertise a d specialized training
required by the receiving institution. Cairo Univ rsity took an active part
in drafting the terms of reference of the experts and developing detailed
training program guidelines which formed the bases of discussion and
negotiations leading to final agreement. The international institutions
concerned were also obliged to provide detailed and systematic information on
the experts and the proposed training courses as a result of CU's stated
needs. This interactive process enabled CU to select the most qualified and
suitable experts for the task at hand as well as the type and most of the cost
effective training programs for its fellows. Among the problems encountered
by fellowship participants was the inability to follow courses in English. In
certain cases it was necessary to organize remedial courses in English.
12.         With respect to expert services, in a number of cases the target
to be achieved as a result of the input were quantifiable and the successful
attainment of these targets became a condition for the continuation or
implementation of the following phase. This kind of an agreement encouraged
both parties concerned to stand by their respective obligations.
Assiut University (AU)
13.         As regards TA, about 188 man-months of fellowships involving 48
teaching staff of the University has been utilized at a cost of SDR 366,740
or about 1% above SAR estimate. This cost also includes 0.5 man-months of
expert services.

14.         A contract with an American college was signed in August 1981
which initially comprised 205 man-months of fellowship at a cost of US$
375,000. It was later scaled down to the present level. The previous
involvement of this college in the development of Ain Shams University was
also a factor in its selection. The fellowship program was found to be
flexible allowing for adjustment to enable focussing on particular interest
and activities, such as increased visits to secondary schools which were not
foreseen in the original plan. These types of changes were often preceded by
intensive discussions with World Bank officials and in particular with the
staff concerned at the American College.
