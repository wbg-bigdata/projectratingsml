PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA-FERTILIZER INDUSTRY CREDIT
(CREDIT 598-IN)
PREFACE
1.        The Association approved a credit of US$105.0 million equivalent
(Credit 598-IN) on December 31, 1975 to the Government of India (GOI) to
assist India's fertilizer industry to modernize its existing production
facilities, eliminate bottlenecks in prodtuction, improve pollution control
systems, and install energy-efficient equipment. Under the Credit,
thirty-six subprojects have been implemented by 13 subborrowers in the
public, private and joint sectors, accounting for 65% of India's fertilizer
manufactiprers. The Credit was onlent to beneficiaries, partly through the
Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) with funds earmarked. In
addition, GOI sponsored three fertilizer industry related studies under
technical assistance.
2.        The Project was designed as a pilot project of a new type of
program lending which is tailored for a specific industry with a number of
firm subproject components. As compared with traditional program or sector
loans whose subproject contents were selected and implemented under the
initiative of governments, the Project was designed to enable the
Association to establish direct relationships with subproject executing
entities. Therefore, all the subprojects under the Project were appraised
individually by the Association mission during appraisal, and included in
the Project scope as firm components. In the course of Project implementa-
tion, however, the original concept of the Project proved to be difficult
to manage, as most of the subprojects were dropped and had to be replaced
by others with similar objectives. Out of nineteen original subprojects,
nine were dropped and replaced by twenty-six new subprojects. Against this
background, this Project Completion Report (PCR) has been prepared partly
following the line used in preparing the PCR for Development Finance
Corporation (DFC) projects within the basic framework used for normal
industrial projects.
3.        In accordance with the revised project performance reporting
procedures this report has been read in the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion
Report was sent to the Borrower for comments; however, none were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA-FERTILIZER INDUSTRY CREDIT
(CREDIT 598-IN)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        In mid-1970, India's fertilizer industry operated at a level of
capacity utilization below 60%, mainly due to bottlenecks in ntilities
supply, the use of old technology and process design faults. The Project
was aimed at assisting India to remove the various obstacles to efficient
operation of the fertilizer industry. The subprojects implemented under
the Project include plant modifications, establishment of additional
storage facilities, installation of captive powvr and energy saving
equipment, and improvement of pollution control and testing facilities
(paras. 1.01, 2.04-2.08).
2,        The Project achieved most of its original objectives
successfully. Rehabilitation/debottlenecking subprojects have contributed
to an overall increase in capacity utilization at most of the existing
production facilities, as anticipated at appraisal. After the Project,
capacity utilization of the subproject entities, except for three companies
which suffered from other unanticipated bottlenecks such as region-wide
electricity interruptions, has increased substantially. The industry-wide
capacity utilization has reached 74% for nitrogenous plants and 89% for
phosphatic plants by 1984/85 as compared with the low level of helow 60% in
the mid-1970s (para. 3.01).
3.        Besides the improvement in capacity utilization, the Project also
contributed to the upgrading of the industry's management efficiency and
financial situation. Following IDA's recommendation, the giant public
sector company, Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCI), which had been
operating several large scale fertilizer plants throughout India with
inadequate management controls, was restructured into five smaller and
more manageable regional corporations. Also, fertilizer prices which
stayed at an extremely low level in the mid-1970s, not sufficient for even
efficient fertilizer manufacturers to generate positive cash flow, were
substantially raised to allow efficient fertilizer manufacturers to become
financially sound. The retention price formula, which was Introduced in
1977 at IDA's recommendation, was designed to enable efficient operators to
realize a 12% after tax return on investments (paras. 7.03-7.04).
4.        Even though the Project has ultimately achieved most of its
original objectives, it encountered considerable difficulties in
implementation. The Project scope changed substantially several times:
nine subprojects in the original subproject list of 19 were dropped and
replaced by 26 other subprojects; the Project was completed 52 months
behind original schedule; and a portion of the credit (US$3.1 million out
of US$105 million) had to be cancelled because GOI could not prepare in
time the needed replacement subprojects (paras. 3.11-3.13).

5.        From the problems experienced in Project implementation, three
major valuable lessons have been learned. One lesson was that a project
involving various types of small subprojects by a number of entities should
be coordinated by a central unit within the country charged with the
responsibility for monitoring and coordinating the Project, preferably at
the government level. Even though this was envisaged in the Project, it
was not put into effect. The other lesson was that the Project should have
been designed to include a smaller number of relatively large subprojects
if the original approach were to be workable. Another lesson was that a
project involving a number of subproject entities requires a good progress
and completion reporting system using a etandardized format and content.
Due to the inefficient reporting system, the Ministry of Chemical Industry
could not consolidate the subproject data and prepare its draft Project
Completion Report (PCR) (paras. 8.01-8.04).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA-FERTILIZER INDUSTRY CREDIT
(CREDIT 598-IN)
I, INTR0DUCTION
1.01      The dramatic fertilizer price increase in the early 1970s hit
fertilizer importing countries, including India, presenting a major threat
to the exploitation of the full potential of high yielding varieties, and
thus the food self-sufficiency programs of these countries. In 1974/75
India was importing 48% of its total nitrogen (N) fertilizer requirements,
52% of its phosphate (P) consumption, and 100% of potash (K) requirements.
Fertilizer imports had been far bigger than previously expected mainly
because actual domestic production had fallen short of expectations due to
low capacity utilization of installed fertilizer capacity. Major reasons
for the low capacity utilization were: (i) use of old technologies; (ii)
process design faults; (iii) shortage of electric power and other
utilities; (iv) shortage of raw materials; (v) management/labor problems;
(vi) financing gaps; and (vii) technical limitations. Because of these
constraints, the target of reducing its dependence on imports down to 30%
during the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1974/75-1978/79) appeared difficult to
achieve.
1.02       Against this background, India prepared an investment program in
collaboration with the Association aimed at expansion of its domestic
fertilizer production base by enhancing the capacity utilization of
existing facilities through rehabilitation/debottlenecking. At GOI's
request, IDA provided assistance to implement the program. Under the
Project thirty-five subprojects have been implemriated to modernize
technology, eliminate bottlenecks, improve efficiency of energy use and
reduce the level of polluting effluents. The Project was initiated in
September 1974, appraised in April 1975, approved by the Board in November
1975, and completed in April 1984, 52 months behind schedule.
II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A.   Project Origin, Preparation, Appraisal, Approval and Credit
Effectiveness
2.01      Since 1967 the Association had been involved in the Indian
fertilizer sector by financing the establishment of several grassroot
fertilizer production facilities in India. To meet the increasing needs of
the agriculture sector, GOI initiated a program in 1974 to expand domestic
fertilizer production under the Fifth Five-Year Plan. The program
consisted of two parts: (i) expansion of grassroot fertilizer production
capacities; and (ii) improvement of capacity utilization of existing plants
which then were operating at below 60% of their designed capacities. In
September 1974, GOI reviewed the possibility of Bank Group assistance in



- 2 -
implementing the latter part of the program in a meeting with a Bank
mission then visiting India, and subsequently requested an IDA credit of
US$105 million for its financing. Following an identification mission in
November 1974 to assist in the preparation of subprojects to be implemented
under the Project, a preappraisal mission visited India in January 1975,
agreed with GOI on the project scope, capital cost estimates, and IDA
role. The Project was appraised in April/May 1975. The IDA Credit was
negotiated and approved by the Board of the Association in November 1975.
It became effective on March 1, 1976.
2.02      The subprojects in the original list of the Project were selected
after detailed discussions with the concerned fertilizer companies and
review with GOI to ensure their quick implementation. However, the
subproject approval procedures within the companies and in the Government
took a long time. In the process, almost half of the original subprojects
were dropped and replaced with others having similar objectives. Because
of substantial delays in the start of implementation, a Problem Project
Brief was prepared in March 1977 delineating the problems facing the
Project. The contents of subprojects were revised several times in order
to substitute problem subprojects with new ones. As a result, the
completion date of the Project which was originally set for December
31, 1979 was postponed three times, The cumulative delay in Project
implementation was 52 months.
2.03      The Credit was made to GOI on standard IDA terms.  About
two-thirds of the Credit (US$67.0 million equivalent) was onlent by GOI
directly to public sector companies; and the remaining one-third (US$33.3
million equivalent) onlent to private sector companies through the
I.ndustrial Development Bank of India (IDBI). The balance of Credit
proceeds (US$2.2 million equivalent) was sold by the Borrower to two
companies at the prevailing exchange rates.
B.  Project Description and Objectives
2.04      The objectives of the Credit were to:  (i) assist in removing
various limitations facing the Indian fertilizer industry and thereby
raise production in the existing facilities from the then industry-wide
average level of less than 60% to about 80-90% capacity utilization; (ii)
help several companies install pollution control facilities consistent with
the agreed environmental standards; and (iii) provide technical assistance
to facilitate fertilizer sector planning at the Government level.
2.05      Project components were selected after reviewing the needs of the
Indian fertilizer industry with the Ministry of Petroleum and Chemicals
(MPC) and the fertilizer producing companies. Nineteen original
subprojects were selected to be carried out by nine companies; three
fertilizer sector studies were included to help GOI in its sector planning.
2.06      The original subprojects under the Project, and their respective
sponsors and objectives are summarized below:

Although the Project was originally to include nineteen firm subproject
components appraised individually as normal industrial projects, the
companies decided not to proceed with several of them and they were
replaced by a number of smaller subprojects with similar objectives. Out
of the nineteen original subprojects1/, nine subprojects were dropped
and replaced by twenty-six others.
1/   Three studies under technical assistance are excluded hereafter unless
otherwise indicated when subprojects are mentioned.



2.08      There were three major reasons for the cancellation of 9 of the
original subprojects. First, four original subprojects were dropped due to
government decisions. Three planned flourine recovery subprojects were
dropped by the sponsors (GSFC, SPIC, CFL) in light of the GOI decision that
these subprojects should be based on commercially unproven Indian
technology rather than the internationally-available and proven
technology. The HPCL's refinery debottlenecking subproject was dropped in
view of the proposed new Mathura refinery which was to be established in
the same marketing area. Second, financial constraints led to the
cancellation of a chlorine/soda ash subproject sponsored by SPIC.  This
sub-project was subsequently implemented without Bank Group financing. As
its financial situation improved, SPIC implemented three other smaller
subprojects later. Third, two other companies voluntarily decided not to
proceed with their subprojects for technical and economic reasons. Ammonia
process control (MIC) and boiler (FCI) were cancelled voluntarily by the
subproject entities. Replacement subprojects were provided, reviewed and
accepted by the Association.
D. Subprojects Characteristics
2.09      The thirty-nine subprojects implemented are grouped into four
main categories: (i) fertilizer capacity expansion and process efficiency
improvements including plant modification/rehabilitation and additional
storage of intermediate product; (ii) capture power and utilities; (iii)
pollution control and testing equipment; and (iv) fertilizer related
studies. The table below compares the original subprojects with the ones
actually implemented.

Due to the major scope change, a comparison of the actual costs for the
whole project with the appraisal estimates is not meaningful. Overall
Project costs were lower than appraisal estimates by 29%, mainly due to
cancellation of subprojects which would have required higher local cost
components. The actual capital costs for most of the original subprojects,
which accounted for about 62% of the total project costs, were slightly
lower than appraisal estimates as shown in Annex 2-2. The actual costs for
the 10 original subprojects which were implemented were US$104.3 million,
about 7.2% lower than the appraisal estimate of US$112.4 million. The main
reason for cost underrun for these components was the rapid devaluation of
local currency during their implementation, resulting in the reduction of
local costs in U.S. dollar terms.
2.11      Actual capital costs for the whole Project are compared with the
appraisal estimates by type of subprojects in the table below.

Actual proportions of Project costs for each type of subproject changed
significantly from the appraisal estimates, reflecting the major changes in
the scope of the Project. The portion of fertilizer capacity expansion and

process efficiency improvement subprojects substantially increased to
account for 81% of the total Project capital costs as compared to an
appraisal estimate of 62%.
F.   Credit Allocation
2.12      The proceeds of the Credit were originally allocated to twenty-
two subprojects (including the three sector related studies sponsored by
the Department of Agriculture (DOA)) to be carried out by fourteen
executing agencies. As the Project scope changed, the Credit prn'eeds were
reallocated to thirty-nine subprojects accordingly. As FCI, the single
largest original sub-borrower, was reorganized into five smaller companies,
the proceeds were reallocated. The following table summarizes the
allocation of the Credit at appraisal and the actual results.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A.   Achievement of Project Objectives
3.01      Although completion of the Project was delayed and the agreed
Project scope was substantially revised, the Project achieved its original
objectives to a large extent. All the subprojects, except for three
nitrogenous fertilizer plants which are currently faced with unexpected
constraints (FCI, HFC and SAIL), resulted in increased capacity utilization
of the existing facilities, efficient energy consumption, and environmental
protection. FCI, HFC and SAIL could also have fully achieved their
objectives if there had not been unexpected interruptions such as power
shortage in their respective regions. As a result of the implementation of
the subprojects, the industry-wide capacity utilization has increased from



- 10 -
the level of below 60% in the early 1970s to the current level of 74% in
nitrogen and 89X in phosphates. Increases in capacity utilization after
the Project for major beneficiaries of the Credit are depicted below:

a/ Capacity utilization before the subproject was launched.
D/ Average capacity utilization for four years after the Project.
-/ Capacity expansion was undertaken during Project implementation.
d/ Due to region-wide electricity interruptions, the facillities have not
been able to fully exploit their capacities.
e/ HFC has been faced with shortage of feedstock.
3.02      In addition to increases in capacity utilization, another major
achievement was reduction of materials consumption per ton of output.
Conversion to cheaper and more economical feedstock and installation of
cost-saving equipment entailed reduction in raw materials consumption and
other inputs per unit of production. Given the shortage of fertilizers in
India the savings in raw materials were directly utilized to increase
fertilizer production.
B. Project Management
3.03      The subprojects under the Project were implemented and managed by
each sponsor with minimum coordination of centralized project management
at the Government level. At each company level, most of the technology-
oriented subprojects were carried out by reputed engineering firms on a
turnkey or semi-turnkey basis, limiting the need for local management.



- 11 -
Worldwide reputed foreign firms were more actively involved In the techno-
logy-intensive subprojects such as plant rehabilitation/debottlenecking.
3.04      Most of the original subprojects underwent delays in initiation
of their implementaion due to delayed project initiation, government
approvals, financial difficulties, or technical arguments, resulting in the
cancellation of several subprojects. In accordance with GOI's responsibi-
lities stipulated in the Credit Agreement, the Ministry of Petroleum and
Chemicals (MPC) was supposed to monitor the implementation of the
subprojects, provide assistance to the subborrowers in obtelning necessary
Government approvals, and coordinate with other related ministries,
including the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA). However, in the
absence of effective project monitoring at the Government level, i.e.,
centralized project management, Project implementation was poorly monitored
and coordinated, thus leading to substantial delays in Project completion
and material changes in Project scope.
C. Technical Assistance and TraininRg
3.05      Three fertilizer sector related studies were sponsored by the
Department: of Agriculture (bOA) and undertaken by local research institutes
under the Project. These are: (i) Fertilizer Demand Projections Study
carried out by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER);
(ii) Fertilizer Transportation Study by the Railway Investigation Transport
Engineering Services (RITES); and the Fertilizer Storage Study undertaken
by the Administrative Staff College of India (ASC). The results of these
studies were subsequently, used by the Government in drawing up fertilizer
sector development stratekgies.
3.06      Local technical staff monitored the implementation of
subprojects, even the ones implemented by foreign contractors on a turnkey
and semi-turnkey basis. After the mechanical completion, the contractors
trained the local staff. PDIL also undertook training sessions for the use
of testing equipment procured centrally by PDIL for the subproject
sponsors.
D.   Use and Performance of Engineering Contractors and Consultants
3.07      Wherever local expertise was not available, foreign consultants
were used in the implementation of subprojects, particularly for
revamping/modernizing of the older facilities which required specialized
technology. Generally, contracts involving foreign participation fell to
the original designers of the plants. These foreign firms implemented some
of the subprojects on a turnkey basis and provided consultancy services for
several other subprojects which were carried out mainly by in-house
technical personnel of the subproject sponsors. The quality of technology
provided by these firms was satisfactory and has not caused any issues with
the subproject sponsors.
3.08      Local engineering firms also participated in the implementation
of subprojects wherever proper local expertise existed. Apart from local
contractors which were mainly charged with installation and construction,



- 12 -
some local engineering firms obtained turnkey contracts for several
subprojects. The quality of local engineering firms was also
satisfactory. For example, PDIL implemented NLC's feedstock conversion
subproject successfully and timely on a turnkey basis.
E. Transfer of Technology
3.09      Local firms, including subproject sponsors, directly managed the
implementation of subprojects as far as local technology permitted with
technical assistance from foreign consultants. In the course of Project
implementation, local firms easily obtained necessary technology because
foreign consultants, most of whom were the original designers of the
plants, were competing for the rapidly growing market in India. While with
the turnkey contracts, particularly in the case of rehabilitation/debottle-
necking subprojects, the transfer of engineering technology had been
limited, the experience obtained from these subprojects has, on the whole,
been substantial and has been well utilized for the improvement of other
plants with similar problems not included in the Project.
F.   Procurement and Performance of Suppliers
3.10      Procurement for the subprojects was carried out following the
Bank's procurement guidelines with no significant problems impacting on
project implementation.' Due to the nature of the subprojects, the average
size of the bid packages was relatively small and the share of proprietary
items not appropriate for international competitive bidding (ICB) was
somewhat large. Where appropriate, components of some subprojects were
awarded to contractors, both foreign and local, on a turnkey basis
following ICB procedures. Adequate international competition and good
response to bid invitations were available under ICB and contracts were
awarded to technically acceptable suppliers at competitive prices and with
appropriate local preference. On an overall basis the suppliers and the
contractors performed satisfactorily delivering technically satisfactory
products on time.
G.   Implementation Schedule
3.11      At appraisal all the subprojects were expected to be completed by
December 31, 1979. However, only five subprojects out of the nineteen
original subprojects, excluding the three study components, were completed
within the original target date. While other subprojects were delayed,
nine subprojects were finally cancelled and replaced by substitute
subprojects later. The overall Project was completed in April 1984, 52
months behind schedule.
3.12      The delay in Project implementation was caused mainly by delays
in sub-project preparation and the long time taken for Government approvals
due to the lack of coordination among related ministries. Since various
government approvals from different authorities were required for
subprojects to be initiated, central coordination at the Government level
was essential for their timely implementation. While delays in approvals
for some subprojects were identified at the beginning of Project



- 13 -
limplementation, the lack of coordination among related ministries which had
different authorities in decision-making resulted in delays in subproject
initiation and ultimately the cancellation of several original sub-
projects.  The approvals for the subprojects were considered with the same
detailed procedures that govern larger investments but not with the same
urgency.
3.13      The slow decision making process in GOI was also the main cause
of delay in replacing the dropped subprojects. Following the cancellation
of several projects, GOI could not agree on substitute projects promptly.
Even the implementation of substitute subprojects was delayed from the
planned schedule due to delays in government approvals. The Association
appraisal Fmission underestimated these institutional constraints facing
Project imiplementation.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A. Commissioning and Start-up
4.01      None of the subprojects were faced with major technical problems
in commissioning and start up. Rehabilitation/debottlenecking subprojects
had direct impact on the performance of the concerned plants. These
subprojects as well as captive power/utility components contributed to
enhancing capacity utilization by eliminating interruptions. New energy
efficiency equipment installed under the Project also improved operational
efficiency by saving inputs consumption per unit of production.
B. Production and Capacity Utilization
4.02      The beneficiaries generally achieved levels of production as
anticipated at appraisal or higher except for the few instances where other
unforeseen constraints limited production. The table in the next page
summarizes the fertilizer production level of the major beneficiaries over
the last four years.

Interruptions in power supply as well as mechanical problems prevented FCI
from fully taking advantage of additional ammonia storage facility at
Sindri carried out under the Project. SAIL achieved a satisfactory level
of capacity utilization at 662 in the first year after the commissioning of
the naphtha reformer subproject which enabled it to convert feedstock from
coke oven gas (COG) to naphtha. However, overall power shortages
prevailing in the region prevented it from realizing the benefits of the
subproject. Also, HFC could not derive full benefits from the subprojects
due to the continuing poor quality of power supply as well as shortage of
feedstock. Measures now being implemented would improve power supply and
enable them to achieve satisfactory operational performance.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A. Financial Rate of Return
5.01     In November 1977, GOI introduced a system of ex-factory
'ricing-retention price formula-which would ensure a reasonable financial
Late of return for fertilizer manufacturers under conditions of efficient
operations (The retentiin price formula is explained in detail in Annex
5-1). The formula sets the price at levels which would enable fertilizer
manufacturers, operating at 80% capacity and at a reasonable level of input



- 15 -
consumption, to generate sufficient cash to cover production costs and a
12% after tax return on capital employed.
5.02      At the time of Project appraisal in 1975, fertilizer prices were
set at levels sometimes insufficient to cover production costs. Therefore,
the IDA Credit Agreement,included a covenant, requiring G0X to take action
to ensure that ex-factory prices, under conditions of efficient operation,
would be sufficient to cover production costs, service debt, and earn a
reasonable return on invested capital.
5.03      Under the retention price formula, fertilizer manufacturers are
guaranteed to earn approximately 10% financial internal rate of return
(FRR) on new investments at 80% capacity utilization. As shown in Annex
5-2, FRRs for subprojects implemented in plants which operated at a
capacity higher than 80%, therefore, are estimated at 10% or above,
Conversely, FRRs for subproject carried out by FCI, SAIL and HFC, which
have achieved low capacity utili!ation, are estimated to be below this
level.
B. Financial Performance
5.04      The introduction of the new pricing system improved the benefici-
aries' financial situation. Until the introduction of the retention price
formula, the relative prices between fertilizers and inputs (both of them
were far below economic prices) did not allow even efficient fertilizer
manufacturers to generate profits. Because of the poor financial
situation, most beneficiaries could not carry out plant improvements
without funds from outside sources. The introduction of the retention
price system combined with an increase in capacity utilization improved the
financial standing of all the beneficiaries. A representative summary of
the recent financial performance of selected beneficiaries (3 public sector
companies, 1 private sector company, and 1 joint sector company) over the
past four years is given in the table on the following page (See Annex 5-3
for details).

illustrated in the case of FCI. Among the 13 subproject sponsors, three
companies (FCI, HFC and SAIL) fell into this category.
VI. SECTORAL AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
A.   Economic Rates of Return
6.01       Based on updated assumptions on capital costs and capacity
utilization, economic rates of return have been calculated for subprojects
whose benefits are quantifiable, ranging from 11.6X to 100. Incremental
benefits and costs take into account the recent operational performance of
the plants. Except for those carried out by HFC and SAIL which have been
operating at capacities substantially below the levels anticipated at
appraisal, updated ERRs are close to appraisal estimates. A comparison of
ERRs between appraisal estimates and actuals is given in Annex 5-2.
B.   Stability of Fertilizer Supply
6.02       Historical supply and demand of fertilizers over the past 25
years are given in Annex 6-1 and summarized in the table below:

Consumption of all fertilizers increased from 305,000 tyn in 1959/60 to 8.2
million tyn in 1984/85 at an average annual growth rate of about 14e00%.
Over the saae period, local production of fertilizers increased at a faster
pace (average annual growth rate of 15.6%). Therefore, import requirements
as percentage of total fertilizers declined from 58% in 1959/60 to 36% in
1984/85.
6.03      The Project enhanced the domestic fertilizer production base
substantially and improved the stability of fertilizer supply for
agriculture.  During 1979/80-1984/85 period, the growth rate of domestic
fertilizer production outpaced that of consumption more rapidly than
previous years mainly because subprojects carried out under the Project
came on stream during the period, substantially raising production levels
of existing facilities.
C. Environmental Aspects
6.04      Most of the subprojects, which have aimed at better plant
performance directly and indirectly, contributed to improving the
environmental situation of the beneficiaries. The beneficiaries installed
pollution testing and control equipment and trained the plant personnel on
their use, thus improving the environment quality of the plants; new
product storage systems reduced the potential of future environmental
problems; new waste recovery units and energy efficient equipment helped to
reduce the level of pollutants and so did retrofitting of old plants.
VII. ASSOCIATION PERFORMANCE
7.01      The Association had financed several grassroot fertilizer
projects until it recognized that the same priority should also be given to
modernization of existing fertilizer production facilities whose capacity
utilization remained low. Once this need was identified, the Association
moved quickly to provide assistance to GOI in implementing appropriate
measures. During Project implementation, the Association's supervision
missions detected various problems causing delays in the initiation of
subproject implementation, and conveyed recommendations promptly in order
to expedite the decision of the Government. Particularly whenever Project
scope needed revision to replace some of the original subprojects, the
Association processed it quickly to enable them to be implemented on time.
7.02      During Credit negotiations, GOI had agreed to implement three
fertilizer industry related studies   which would provide the basis for
fertilizer industry development planning. These studies were:
(i) fertilizer demand projection; (ii) fertilizer transportation study; and
(iii) study on fertilizer storage. All the studies were undertaken by
local research institutions. The Association had reviewed with the
Department of Agriculture (DOA), the study sponsor, the scope of studies,
and followed up the studies. The findings of the studies contributed to
the betterment of GOI's fertilizer sector planning as well as to the



- 19 -
formulation of Bank Group lending strategies.  A 12-member steering
advisory committee in DOA supervised these studies.
7.03      At the recommendation of the IDA project team, the giant public
sector company, Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCI), which had operated
seven large scale fertilizer plants scattered throughout India, was
restructured into five smaller and more manageable regional corporations,
namely: (i) Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCI); (ii) Hindustan
Fertilizer Corporation (HFC); (iii) Rashtriya Chemicals Fertilizer (RCF);
(iv) National Fertilizer Limited (NFL); and (v) Planning and Development
India Ltd. (PDIL). FCI, with plants in diverse regions, was poorly managed
due to lack of effective centralized management and coordination, slow
decision making process, and difficulties in corporate planning. Recogniz-
ing this management problem from the inception of the project work, the IDA
project team had recommended reorganization of FCI into several smaller
regional companies of manageable sizes. The reorganization was formally
announced in late 1977 and took effect in late 1979. it has been generally
acknowledged that the reorganization has fully served the purpose.
7.04      As mentioned in para 5.02, IDA recommended to GOI to revise its
fertilizer pricing mechanism, and consequently the retention price formula
was introduced in 1977.  In the mid-1970s, ex-factory fertilizer prices
were maintained low to subsidize agriculture. At times, fertilizer prices
were set at levels which did not allow even efficient manufacturers to
cover production costs. Therefore, IDA recommended to GOI to consider a
pricing mechanism which could ensure a reasonable rate of return on
investments for efficient operators. This retention price mechanism
improved not only the financial viability of fertilizer manufacturers but
also operating efficiency. The retention price formula penalizes low
capacity utilization as well as high input consumption.
VIII. LESSONS LEARNED
8.01      Although the Project was ultimately implemented and achieved most
of the original objectives successfully, several lessons have been learned
from the problems the Project encountered during implementation. These
problems caused a substantial change in Project scope as well as a 52-month
delay in Project completion.
8.02      One important lesson was that a project involving a number of
different types of subprojects should be designed to provide for a strong
central coordination unit to undertake the responsibility for coordinating
and implementing the subprojects. Particularly in countries where the
decision making process is scattered and diverse, coordination at the
Government level is key to successful implementation of projects. In fact,
delays in Project implementation and changes in Project scope were mainly
due to lack of coordination among concerned Government authorities which
provide various approvals for subprojects in terms of scope, technology,
economic viability, local fund allocations, and other aspects. The lack of
coordination also made it difficult to determine alternative subprojects



- 20 -
timely for IDA consideration. If similar problems are anticipated for a
future project, Government approval requirements and procedures should be
closely assessed during appraisal, and, if necessary, practical assurances
from the Governments should be obtained before the signing of loan (credit)
agreement. These assurances also need to be supported by a responsible
project coordination unit which is obligated to monitor, coordinate, and
expedite the implementation of subprojects, particularly for sector/program
credits with numerous smaller subprojects in countries with diversified
decision making process.
8.03      The other important lesson learned from the Project was that the
original concept of the Project could have worked out quite well if the
Project had concentrated on a more limited number of relatively large
subprojects. Throughout the implementation of the Project, it was almost
impossible for the IDA project team to effectively maintain relationships
with numerous subproject sponsors for the supervision of their respective
components. Where a number of small subprojects are implemented under one
project scope, frequent scope changes cannot be avoided. As nine original
subprojects were dropped and replaced by 26 new subprojects, tremendous
additional efforts had to be made by the IDA project team to follow up
these changes. For a project with similar configuration, a typical sector
loan appears more appropriate to handle. In this case, greater authority
could be given to borrowers in implementing the overall program including
the selection of subprojects based on agreed guidelines. Frequent revision
of the legal documents also could be avoided.
8.04      Another lesson learned from the Project was that well established
progress reporting should be incorporated in designing a project with a
number of project sponsors, possibly by standardizing of the reporting
format and contents. While direct project progress reporting by project
sponsors is generally preferred as a means of maintaining direct
communication with the beneficiaries, unstructured reporting from numerous
beneficiaries makes it difficult to monitor individual subprojects
systematically. Due to the lax description of reporting requirements, the
progress reports submitted by the subproject sponsors differed to a large
extent in terms of contents and details of subproject progress. Some
reports did not even contain project related information at all. As a
consequence, the supervision of the Project was not satisfactory, and the
preparation of Project Completion Report (PCR) was delayed. Besides, the
Borrower could not prepare its own PCR despite the specific guidance
provided by the IDA project team well in advance of the completion of the
Project in August 1982 and repeated request thereafter. Supervision
workload could have been reduced tremendously if a good progress reporting
system had been designed.

the formula enunciated by the Marathe Committee in November 1977. The
calculations are made for pricing periods for 3 years as follows:
(i)    Share capital employed in urea production.
(ii) + Retained Earnings.
(iii) - Capital employed outside the business and accumulated
surplus cash.
(iv)  - Equity employed in line of business (a minimum level is
maintained at paid-in share capital).
(v)    29.4% return on capital employed.
(vi) + Variable and fixed production costs at 80% capacity
utilization related to fertilizer production, with
depreciation as provided in the company balance sheet.
(vii) + Interest on short and long-term debt associated with urea
production.  In each successive block of 3 years, interest
on long and short-term debt are considered equal to those
of the middle year.
(viii)  - Ex-factory revenue to producer.
(ix) = Production volume of fertilizer at 80% capacity
utilization.
(x) = Unit Retention Price allowed.
2.        While operating cost changes are reflected immediately, other
parameters like capital employed and interest charges are only reassessed
in intervals of three years. Fixed assets are not revalued each year, but
recorded at historical costs.
