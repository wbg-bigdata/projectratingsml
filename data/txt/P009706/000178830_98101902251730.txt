TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS Oii A PROPOS;ED
CREDIT TO TIIE GOVEPN'MENT OF INDIA FOP A
FERTILIZER INDUSTRY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Government of India (GOI) in an amount equiva-
lent to US$105 million on standard IDA terms to help finance increased
fertilizer production from existing plants in India.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report, "Economic Situation and1 Prospects of India'
(691a-It' dated May 1, 1975), was distributed to the Lxecutive Directors on
May 20, 1975. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        India is exceptional among the Bank Group's member countries for
its size and diversity. While India's economic policies and performance
have their shortcomings, the sheer magnitude of the task facing the Gov-
ernment must be recognized; the country is divided into more than 20 states
with a population of some 600 million and over 60 languages. The country's
poverty and inadequate domestic savings, together with a net transfer of
external resources averaging in recent years only about US$1 per head per
annum, have imposed sharp limitations on the rate of growth. Account must
be taken, also, of the uncertainties imposed by the erratic availability
of water. A bad monsoon, which is inevitable from time to time, has a
pervasive influence over the entire economy and wipes out the results of
years of efforts. Thus, the annual growth of national income has averaged
a modest 4% during the past 25 years, but only about 1% during the last
four years (1971/72-1974/75), which have included two consecutive monsoon
failures -- i.e., an actual decline in per capita terms.
4.        Since independence, progress has been impressive on many fronts,
bhut disappointing on others, and has all too often fallen short of Incia's
massive needs. The growth of the socio-economic infrastructure (transport,
education, health services, etc.) has been spectacular, but has often been
achieved at high cost and has yielded results of variable quality.    Mtany
inidustrial and agricultural investment schemes have been highly successful,
but others have taken excessively long to be completed and have operated
well below full capacity. In some regions of the country, growth and
structural change have been rapid and compare favorably with developments
in many other parts of the world, but in 6ther regions there has been star.-
nation and possibly even decline.   Despite these improvements and although
the distribution of income in India is relatively even by comparison with
moost developing countries, there has been little impact upon the living



standards of the vast masses of the urban anid rura_ population.   The Covern-
ment has become increasin,lv concerned about the plight of the lower income
strata, which - conservati vely measured - consist of some 200 million people
with incomes of less than LIS$60 per head per year, and has initiated in
recent years a variety of programs specifically designed to alleviate
poverty.
5.        The structure oa the econo;my has been slow to change. Agriculture
remains the dominant sectcr, accounting 'or some 45% of national product in
the early 1970s compared with around 49% twenty years previously. The share
of output contributed by the industrial sector has increased only slowly and,
since the late 1960s, has remained approximately constant at a level of 23%.
There has, however, been a shift in the composition of industrial production,
with consumer, intermediate, and capital goods now contributing about one
third each, compared with an overwhelming preponderance of consumer goods
production 25 years ago.
6.        Despite the slow pace of change and despite the undeniable magni-
tude of the problems confronting her, India has the potential in a number
of important fields to mount a development effort which has a reasonable
chance of success in the longer run. In agriculture, as discussed in the
economic report of May 1975, the particular opportunities of substantial
promise for improving the food situation over the next decade are:
a.   Rejuvenation of the Green Revolution in wheat which
has taken place in recent years in the Northwest
and to a lesser extent in Bihar and West Bengal,
but which has been losing momentum since about
1970. This is the result of deficiencies which
can be corrected -- most importantly seed deteriora-
tion and lagging irrigation development.
b.   Better use of the vast potentials that have been
created by surface irrigation through more expedi-
tious project completion and complementary land
and on-farm improvements to ensure better manage-
ment and higher productivity of water.
c.   Acceleration of groundwater development, especially
in the Eastern regions, which are figuratively de-
scribed as "floating on water,'" where the untapped
potential is large and where consequently there are
large opportunities for multiple cropping, better
water management and greater crop security.
d.   Promotion of increased production of monsoon rice,
based on improved varieties which as yet have had
only modest success but which are expected, on



- 3 -
the basis of current researchi, to open the way
Lo mTch greater productivity over India's vast
rain-fed rice producing areas during the next
few years.
e.   Pursuit of the promising, although somewhat less
definite, potential for greater productivity in
drvland cultivation and for extensive introduction
of higher-yielding varieties of coarse grains.
Because of the difficulties likely to be encountered in the effective devel-
opment of these potentials, their realization is likely to follow uneven time
patterns, probably coming in bursts of expanded production as in the case
of the Green Revolution. And, along with administrative concentration and
effectiveness, they.will all require provision of the supplies and services,
especially fertilizer and power for irrigation, which are essential comple-
ments of the necessary technical and environmental changes.
7.        Greater agricultural success would also make an important contribu-
tion to India's perenially difficult balance of payments situation, which is
frequently aggravated by the need for large food imports. From the balance
of payments viewpoint, another essential ingredient for a resumption of
modest growth is sustained export volume growth at considerably higher rates
than have been achieved historically. In view of the composition of Indian
exports, the momentum for such growth would have to be provided primarily
by the rapid expansion of industrial exports which, in addition to easing
the foreign exchange constraint, would act as an important stimulant to
industrial growth -- notably absent since the mid-sixties. In the field
of energy, too, there is considerable potential in the development of
recently discovered oil resources and in the continued expansion of coal
production.
8.        It is hard, however, to conceive of the timely and effective
exploitation of these various potentials unless administrative capabili-
ties, which are overtaxed and diffused in an attempt to guide and control
most economic activities, are focused on these areas. The requirement for
industrial export stimulation would appear to be more generous and expedi-
tious incentives, sufficiently attractive and reliable to induce domestic
producers to venture into the competitive pressures of world markets.
Finally, realization of India's potential will undoubtedly also require
a considerable infusion of external assistance, both to ease the payments
constraints and to supplement the limited domestic resources available for
development.
9.        While there is thus potentiai for resuming the ilnterrupted process
of growth, there remains the formidable obstacle of the short-run difficulties
facing India.  Last year began with deficient winter rains and a poor spring
harvest, with one of the worst Governmient wheat procurement experiences on
record, with a prospective balance of payments deficit of US$2.5 billion or
twice as much as in the preceding year, with inflation running at an annual



rate of 30% and a fiscal situ aci,Ln s eirig ly out of harnd. a .d wiLh :e,
energy and material shortages and litclu prosTact. for al eviatirn   i i I Jn ;,u r
imports within the severe constra:ints of th.e balance o( payments.  E  :as
hardly surprising in this situaton that adiustrtent to irr-redlate siificult,-cs
was the prime economic preoccupaLion.   Growuth hz.d necessarily to ta"'c a secolid
place to short-run exigencies in the emphasis or economic policy in this
first year of the Fifth Five--Year Plan period.
10.       Monetary expansion, which bad been ranning at a rate of 15, in
1973/74, was reduced through tight credit restrictions.  Tne burden of
these restrictions was borne largely by private and Government commercial
activities, without a significant reduction in the rate of increase in net
bank financing of the Government Budget. To this curtailment of credit to
the commercial sector, there was added thie deflationary influence arising
from a massive trade deficit; as a result, the rate of monetary expansion
in 1974/75 was reduced to about 6%, or less than half that of the previous
year. This, in combination with some improvements in physical supply,
relieved the upward pressure on prices, and there was even a small price
reduction in the second half of the fiscal year. With continuing tight
monetary policies, prospects are for price stability this year.
11.       The food problem was probably the single most threatening element
on the economic scene last year. A poor harvest and low procurement in the
spring was only the start of agricultural adversities. Next was failure
of the mid-year monsoon in many key agricultural areas and a monsoon (kharif)
crop which fell below that of 1973 by about 5 million tons. The result was
a severe shortage of domestic foodgrains for the public distribution system,
with availabilities only about half of an austere level of requirements. A
real food crisis was averted, however, by imports of more than 6 million tons
of foodgrains during the year ending in March 1975; this was almost twice as
much as the imports of 1973/74.   With these imporrs and with relative en.pha-
sis on food distribution in the cities rather than the countryside, where
supply conditions were presumed to be not quite so unmanageable, the threat-
ening food situation was weathered, although not without hunger and priva-
tion for a great many of the rural poor who were unable to afford much of
what food was available.
12.       The oil situation was managed, although at double the cost for a
marginally lower import level, by curbs on consumption and by substitution.
Motor spirits were heavily taxed to reduce consumption by about 20%; factories
and power plants were converted from fuel oil to coal w1herever possible
and supplies of fuel oil were reduced by more than 15%; coal production,
after years of stagnation, was increased by about 13%, and, after a poor
start, transport managed to keep up with the additional coal in spite of
serious labor troubles on the railways. There was also some improvemenL ill
the operation of the deficient power system tihrough special efforts to raise
the low capacity utilization of thermal plarts and by a more systematic allo-
cation of available power, with special priority for requiresients of a,ri-
cultural irrigation and fertilizer production. Power shortage has remiainod,
nevertheless, a severe constraint on the economies of many regions. Among



other critical shortages, the supply situation eased in the course of Ehe
year, especially for fertilizer, steel and non-ferrous metals. The fer-
tilizer situation was brought into better balance by a combination of
substantial imports and some lag in demand attributable largely to poor
weather and sharply increased prices. Steel and other metal supplies
also improved during the year, with some increase in domestic production
in the case of steel and also because of price resistance and uncertainty
in a sluggish industrial situation.
13.       Last year's balance of payments turned out to be manageable in
spite of a 47% jump in the import bill. Economies in import volume helped.
More importantly, there was also an increase of 28% in the value of exports.
The main payments support, however, was an increase of about US$1 billion
in external financing, made up of large drawings on the International Mone-
tary Fund including the Fund's Oil Facility, larger aid from the India
Consortium including the World Bank Group, oil purchases on credit, a
million tons of wheat on loan from the USSR, and additional food aid from
several other countries. With all this, in 1974/75 India had to draw on
its gross reserves (US$1,416 million as of March 31, 1974) by only about
US$50 million, but external debt service requirements in the medium term
were increased, as were obligations to the IMF.
14.       This year (1975/76) the economic situation, though still very
difficult, has started much more favorably than last year. With an excellent
spring (rabi) crop, and a favorable summer monsoon, foodgrain production is
confidently predicted to achieve a record of over 110 million tons. Inflation
continues to be tightly curbed, and the wholesale price index for July 1975
was actually 2.1% lower than a year earlier. With good rains and greatly
increased coal production, the power situation has improved, and the Govern-
ment's expectation is of 20% growth in power generation over the year. However,
although the performance of several public industries has improved consider-
ably, demand, particularly for consumer goods, continues to stagnate, and
the Government's target of 5-6% growth is unlikely to be achieved. Industrial
growth of 3-4% now appears much more likely.
15.       Exports in terms of rupees rose by 15% in the first six months of
1975/76 over the corresponding period of 1974/75. This rise reflects both
the effects of exchange depreciation and significant volume increases.
Despite a continued good export performance, the trade deficit is likely to
be as much as US$1.8 billion, compared with about US$1.7 billion last year,
and hardly any trade deficit at all in 1972/73, which was before India's
terms of trade worsened. Adding to the 1975/76 trade deficit another US$800
million of payments on external obligations, and taking account also of
probable net invisible receipts, this year's overall balance of payments
deficit seems likely to come to about US$2.4 billion, or about the same
level as last year. These enormous deficits persist in any reasonable
calculation of minimum import requirements of fuel, food, fertilizer and
other essentials, for which further compression seems hardly feasible,
especially with the expected pick-up of the economy.



16.       Fortunately, nearly half of this year's prospective deficit
(about US$1,155 million) can be covered from gross disbursements of
previously committed foreign aid, including just over a billion dollars
of Consortium aid about evenly divided between bilateral and World Bank
Group sources. Eastern Europe is expected to provide perhaps US$100 mil-
lion, which is down considerably from last year in the absence of further
food assistance from the USSR. India has already drawn US$240 million
from this year's Oil Facility, and can reasonably expect about US$570 mil-
lion from disbursements out of Consortium pledges made in June. This leaves
US$600 million to be financed from other sources, including an inevitable
drawdown of foreign exchange reserves, which stood at US$1,392 million at
August 31, 1975.
17.       To highlight the crucial variables in India's longer-term pay-
ments outlook, the May 1975 economic report contains some projections, for
the 10 years following 1975/76, illustrating India's debt management prob-
lem. Broadly speaking, the conclusion which emerges is that a modest in-
crease in India's import capability - an average of 5.2% per annum after
allowing for inflation - could he achieved, provided: (a) new aid commit-
ments in real terms (including IMF facilities and the aid provided by oil
producers) remain approximately at 1974/75 levels, (b) India's exports
attain an average volume growth of about 8% between 1976/77 and 1985/86,
and (c) the bulk of new aid continues to be provided on concessional
terms. Given the above assumptions, the debt service ratio (expressed as
a percentage of export earnings) would rise from about 19% in 1974/75 to
23% in 1979/80 and then decline slowly. India's external public debt out-
standing and disbursed on tarch 31, 1974, stood at US$10.2 billion.
18.       A considerably improved export performance, which will require
policy measures to improve incentives, is crucial to a successful develop-
ment effort.   To the degree that exports fall short of the 8% growth target,
India would not be able to increase her borrowing to meet a larger balance
of payments deficit; the result would be slower growth throughout the eco-
nomy. Against this background, it is encouraging that the Government is
showing an increased determination to exploit India's export potential.
Many measures have been announced that will make exports both more profit-
able and easier to produce. For example, priority is being given to ex-
porters' need for scarce raw materials; exporters will be protected against
rises in the price of steel that occur after the signing of contracts; pro-
duction for export beyond authorized capacity will be permitted automati-
cally; cash assistance rates will be increased to take fixed costs into
account; and import replenishment licenses will be liberalized.
PART II - BANK GROVP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
19.       Since 1949, the Bank Group has made 44 loans and 75 development
credits to India totaling US$1,436 million and US$3,635 million (both net
of cancellation), respectively. Of these amounts, US$715 million has been



repaid, and US$1,559 million was still und-sbursed as of October 3i, 29;.
Annex II contains a summary statement of d.sbursements as of October 3,
1975, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
20.       Since 1957, IFC has made 14 commitments in India totaling US$,'.;
million, of which US$9.6 million has been repaid, US$7.6 million sold a2',1
US$6.9 million cancelled. Of the balance of US$27.7 million, US$21.2 mil-
lion represents loans and US$6.5 million equity.   A summary statement of 1FC
operations as of October 31, 1975, is also included in Annex II (page 2).
21.       In recent years, the emphasis of Bank Group lending has been on
agriculture. The Bank Group has been particularly active°in supporting
minor irrigation and other on-farm investments through agricultural credit
operations. Major irrigation, marketing, seed development, and dairying are
other agricultural activities supported by the Bank Group. Also, the Bank
Group has been active in financing the expansion of output in the fertilizer
sector and, through its sizeable assistance to development finance institu-
tions, in a wide range of geographically scattered medium- and small-scale
industrial enterprises.   IDA financing of industrial raw materials and com-
ponents for selected priority sectors has been instrumental in facilitating
better capacity utilization in industry. The Bank Group has also been active
in supporting infrastructure development for power, telecommunications, and
railways. Family planning, education, water supply development, and urban
investments have also received Bank Group support in recent years.
22.       The direction of assistance under the Bank/IDA program has been
consistent with India's needs and the Government's priorities. The emphasis
of the program on agriculture, industry, power, and transport remains highly
relevant. Projects designed to foster agricultural production through the
provision of essential inputs such as credit for on-farm investments, command
area development of existing irrigation schemes, and seed production form
an important aspect of the Bank Group's program for the next years. Special
emphasis will be given to projects benefitting small farmers. Lending in
support of infrastructure and industrial investments will focus on energy-
related projects. Repeater credits for power and railways have high priority
in this context, and discussions are under way with the Government in an effort
to identify and prepare projects specifically designed to facilitate coal
transport. Lending for fertilizer projects, which has been an important
feature in recent years, is expected to continue to occupy a prominent place
in the future progcam.
23.       The need for a substantial net transfer of external resources
in support of India's economy has been a recurrent theme of Bank economic
reports and of the discussions within the India Consortium. The need for
readily usable foreign exchange assistance is especially pressing at a time
when output and investment have to be adjusted to a radically different
price situation. Consequently, Bank Group lending for critical industrial
raw materials and components continues to be an essential element within
the overall program of assistance. As in the past, Bank Group assistance



for projects in India shouLd include, as a?propriate, .he finaicnng 04f
local expenditures. India imports relatively few capital goods because
of the capacity of the domestic capital goods industry.    The niport com-
ponent of projects tends to be especially low in such high-priority areas
as agriculture, education, and family planning. For the Banlk Group to be
able to make an appropriate contribution to the financing of projects i n
these sectors, it is important to cover a proportion of local expenditures.
24.       Of the external assistance received bv India, the proportion coa-
tributed by the Bank Group has grown significantly. In 1969/70, the Banic
Group accounted for 34% of total commitments, 13% of gross disbursements,
and 12% of net disbursements as compared with an estimated 35%, 28% and 42%,
respectively, in 1973/74, and the contribution of the Bank Group is expected
to continue growing. Whereas on March 31, 1974, the Bank Group's share of
India's outstanding externatl public debt was 23%, by 1979 it is likely to
account for about 25%. Because Bank Group assistance to India is predomi-
nantly in the form of IDA credits, debt service to the Bank Group will rise
slowly. In 1974/75, about 14% of India's total debt service payments were
to the Bank Group.
PART III - THE FERTILI7ER SECTOR
25.       Increased fertilizer production is an essential element in India's
program to increase agricultural production. Approximately 23% of total
Plan expenditure has been devoted to agriculture in the past six years,
with priority being given to accelerating the spread of modern technology
through increasing the availability of inputs such as improved seeds, irri-
gation, credit and fertilizers. The output of foodgrains, particularly the
high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice, is largely a function of the fer-
tilizer application rate. It is estimated that, under present conditions in
India, the application of one nutrient ton of fertilizer yields an average
incremental production of five to seven tons of grain. Thus, shortfalls in
the supply of fertilizer, wlhether imported or produced domestically, have
consequences of the utmost gravity for essential food supplies.
26.       Needless to say, increased supplies of fertilizer alone are not the
sole answer to greater agricultural production in India. Appropriate policy
measures and the availability of other inputs -- water, seeds, pesticides,
research, extension services, credit, and appropriate pricing and distribu-
tion systems -- are essential to improved agricultural productivity. Even
for fertilizer alone, there are a number of critical policy and institutional
issues -- including industry organization, pricing and credit systems,
infrastructure, feedstock supply and prices, distribution systems, and
educational and support programs to encourage fertilizer use by small
farmers and non-users -- which must be resolved to realize the full poten-
tial of this input. Since the fertilizer sector developed into a signifi-
cant economic factor only recently, it is not surprising that a number of
governmental institutions are involved, that decision-making is dispersed,



and that coordination of policies and prog,raus is less than coraplee.  P-z-
duction is under the auspices of the Ministry of Petroleumi and Cheiica',a
imports under the auspices of the 1{inerals and Metals Trading Corpora,ion;
distribution and use under the auspices of the Ministry of Agriculture. In
an effort to improve the present situation, the Government has agreed to
undertake a study, including a ten-year forecast to be updated annually, of
fertilizer demand in India and has indicated its intention to establish a
high-level authority which will adv'se on and coordinate poLicie-i affectiiqLn
fertilizer production and use. The Government has also a;,reed to tJ.
measures to improve the management and operations of public-: Sector fcztili:mr
enterprises; one possibility being examined would involve ,-X-ae    6ie'et<
of authority and responsibility to iindividual units (Sections 4.02, 4.0` a;,U
4.05 of Development Credit Agreement).
27.       Consumption of fertilizers in India has increased at an avera:e,
annual rate of about 17% over the past two decades, but it still re-mains
very low relative to usage in other countries.   In 1974/7', it stood at
2.74 million nutrient tons, viftually the same as in the two previous
years. This stagnation in consumption is attributable to scarcity, steep
price increases, inadequate credit, drought, and the introduction of a nui-
ber of very restrictive administrative measures to deal with the shortage
situation which prevailed in 1972-74. IHowever, with many of these restrai;ilt:
on consumption now removed, the Bank staff estimates that fertilizer use will
reach 5.4 million nutrient tons by 1978/79 and 8.7 million tons by 1983/84,
if appropriate policies are maintained. These projections are highly tentLa-
tive; more reliable estimates should be developed through the 10-year demand
forecast mentioned above.
28.       Although domestic production has grown at an average annual rate
of 16% since 1953/54, and reached a level of 1.5 million tons in 1974/75,
it supplies less than 60% of consumption. The level of capacity utiliza-
tion is low, reaching only some 60% of the installed capacity of 2.6 mil-
lion tons in 1974/75. The reasons for this include power shortages and
fluctuations and the fact that design deficiencies and aging equipment
make the effective capacity in several plants less than the rated capa-
city. Lack of raw materials, management/labor problems, and other infra-
structure scarcities also contribute to low operating levels. Moreover,
projects tunder construction suffer from serious delays in commissioning,
particularly because of procurement and start-up difficulties, financial
constraints, and delays in the supply of equipment and construction serv-
ices.
29.       To meet the anticipated demand by the end of the decade, an ambi-
tious investment program is currently being implemented. The program in-
cludes 16 ongoing projects and five proposed new projects. Most of the
capacity additions from this program will come on stream during 1977-79
and would raise installed capacity to 6.7 million nutrient tons by the
end of 1979. These targets, which would approach self-sufficiency in
nitrogenous fertilizer and provide close to 85% of projected phosphate
consumption, are reasonable, although there is a risk that projects may



be delayed, given the 1 r;   ca- o; 0.      s.   :c  _c_ a         -
tion capability.  The investr:enL prof5ra:a.>: i  in g te m.  rn 0
schemes being implemented and those in the proposed projecc, -s est.ac.-
to cost USS4,095 million, of wl-hich; USSi,475 r.l:ioin is fore-ign exc-aa>-se.
The Government has agreed to furnish to the Association L-rogress repo-:.s on
its provision of funds for all on-going public sector fertijizer proj'cts
twice a year (Section 4.01 of Develop-mient Credit Agreerient).
30.       Even if the ambitious prociuction targets are attained, fer.._  zer
itdports -- including potash, which is not produced domestically -- are e.\-
pected, on the basis of the tentative demand projections mentioned above,
to amount to 1.0 - 1.2 million nutrient tons annually througih 1980/31.   The
total foreign exchange cost of fertilizer consumption, including both fin-
islhed products and raw materials, is expected to be about USSi billion a
year at the end of this decade. however, the foreign exchange cost per
nutrient ton consumed is projected to decline from US*210 in 1976/77 to
USS160 in 1979/80, as domestic production supplies an increasing propor-
tion of total requirements.
31.       With the exception of three new projects which are coal-basec.d,
all of India's existing and planned fertilizer plants are based primarily
on petroleum products, including naphtha and fuel oil, or domestic natural
gas. In the long run, coal may become the preferred feedstock for produc-
tion of nitrogenous fertilizers in India, given her sizeable coal deposits
and the impact of recent increases in petroleum prices on the economics of
fertilizer production. Expansion of fertilizer capacity in the near future,
howqever, is expected to be based on heavy fuel oil or naphtha, because of
constraints on coal production, more inmecdiate economic utilization of
additional coal output as a substitute for petroleum products in power
generation and other industrial uses, and the desirability of taking advan-
tage of anticipated progress in the techinology of coal-based ammonia svn-
tlhesis.  Thus, for at least the next two or three years India shoui(i pursue
the rapid implementation of projects based on petroleuim feedstocks whic-l1 are
already at an advanced stage of preparation, while preparing for coal-based
pioduction when both coal supplies and suitable technology are available.
32.       The Bank Grou) has been actively supporting the fertilizer industry
in India for some time.   IDA has made five credits, for the Fertilizers and
Clhemicals, Travancore Ltd. (FACT) plant in Cochin and for the Gorakphur,
;iangal, Trombay and Sindri Units of the Fertilizer Corporation of India
(FCI).  These projects have all aimed at a balanced expansion of capacity
wlhile at the same time removing bottlenecks to the efficient utilization
of existing capacity. WIork on the FCI projects is proceeding satisfac-
torily, and the Gorakhpur plant is scheduled to be comm.issioned at the
encd of 1975.  The Cocliin II project, whicht was approved in July 1971, was
envisaged as a follow-up to Cochin I, a rajor amrmonia/urea complex financed
bv a bilateral credit, wlich was expected to commence operations in mid-1971.
lowever, labor and management difficulties and problemis in the implementa-
tion of Cochin I have lecd to delays in Cochin II, wlhich is about two years



behind schedule.   Procurement for Cochin I-- ihas, however, nJw bee-_ V>_uaiiv
coriipleted and substantial disbursemerts made. A Bank loan was signled in
January 1975 for a new plant to be constructed by the Indian Farmers Fer-
tilizer Cooperative, Ltd. (IFFCO), but implementation has been delayeu as
a result of a change in feedstock from fuel oil to naphtha. IFC has par-
ticipated in two private sector fertilizer projects: Indian Explosives
Ltd. and Zuari Agro-Cliemicals Ltd., both of which are now in operation.
Fertilizer raw material imports have been included in the Industrial Im-
ports program for India.
PART IV - TIE PROJECT
33.       The proposed project was appraised by missions which visited India
in January and in April/May 1975.   The appraisal report (No. 928-II7, dated
Nlovember 24, 1975) is being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
Negotiations were held in Washington in viovember, 1975. The Government of
India and the Fertilizer Corporation of India were represented by Mr. V.N.
Rajagopalan of the Ministry of Finanice and Mr. S. Veuikataraman of the Ministry
of Petroleum and Chemicals, and the Industrial Development Bank of India by
Mr. K.D. Dudhmal, Manager, Projects. Attached as Annex III is a credit and
project summary.
Project Description
34.       The proposed project is concentrated entirely on improving the
utilization of existing fertilizer production capacity in India. Together
witlh other modernization schemes now being implementedi, it would allow pro-
duction in existing facilities to be raised from the present industry-wide
average of about 60% of capacity to 85-90%' by 1979, tlhereby increasing
returns on prior investment. The credit would assist ten fertilizer plants
in removing production bottlenecks, improving pollution control and increas-
ing the production of industrial chemicals.    It would also assist in increas-
ing the capacity of one refinery to produce petroleum feedstock for the fer-
tilizer industry. In terms of incremental production, the project would
increase fertilizer output by 253,000 metric tons per year (TPY) of nutri-
ents, raising production in the ten plants by an average of 13% of their
combined capacity.
35.       The project would involve three public sector firms, including FCI,
the largest fertilizer producer in India and one of the largest in the world,
and the largest single beneficiary of the credit.    FCI would install captive
power generation at two of its plants (GorakhpUr and Durgapur) and add a new
steam generation unit at another (Trombay). The project also includes ammo-
nia tank wagons and storage facilities, and pollution control and testing
equipment for FCI.   The portion of the credit allocated for FCI (US$36 million)
would be onlent by the Government for 15 years, including 4 years' grace,
at an effectivr interest rate of 10-1/4%.



36.       The allocations for zae ohler- two pli 1.c secz:or com.pani3 -Xv
million for Aeyveli and US$144.5 -,-illion for the Rourkela fertilizer ;;anL
of the Ilindustan Steel Corporation -- would be maGe available by GC6! as equity
investment. These sub-projects would involvc conversion from lignice an.c
coke oven gas, respectively, to petroleum feed-.tock, which is expected to
increase capacity utilization in both cases from about 50%O to 90%.
37.       The project wouldI also assist chree fertilizer plants and one re-
finery jointly owned by the public and private sectors. Modernization of
the ammonia and urea facilities of Mfadras Fertilizers (to which TTS1 rillion
of the proposed credit is allocated) and of the ammonia and phosphoric acid
facilities of the Gujarat State Fertilizer Corporation (GSFC) are expected
to lead to a 6% and 10% increase in their respective capacity utilization.
A unit to convert excess ammonia to soda ash and ammoniurm chloride would
be installed at the Southern Petro-Chemical Industries (SPIC) plant in Tamil
Nadu.  In addition, GSFC and SPIC would implement sub-projects to reduce
pollution through the recovery of fluorine and its conversion to cryolite,
wliich is used in aluminum manufacture. These two companies account for
US$8 million and US$13 million, respectively, of the allocation of the Droposed
credit.  The reactivation of idle equipment, addition of some new equipment,
and the expansion of utilities at the Hindustan Petroleum refinery in Bombay
(US$3 million of the proposed credit) would exoand its refining capacity from
3.5 million TPY to 6.0 million TPY of crude oil, which would add sufficient
petroleum feedstock for about five large ammonia plants.
38.       Finally two private sector companies would be included in the proj-
ect. Coromandel Fertilizers in Andhra Pradesh (US$3 million) would install
power generation facilities, leading to a 7% increase in capacity utilization;
this company would also add facilities for fluorine recovery and conversion
to aluminum fluoride. Zuari Agro Chemicals (Goa) (US$4 million) would
modernize its ammonia unit, thereby increasing capacity by 10%, and would
reduce the pollution content of the effluents from its urea plant.
39.       Madras Fertilizers and Coromandel would be able to purchase their
portion of the foreign exchange made available under the credit withi their
own rupee resources. SPIC, GSFC, Zuari and 7lindustan Petroleum would require
credit, and the proceeds of the credit allocated for them would be on-lent to
the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) for 15 years, including 4 years'
grace, at 8-1/2%, interest.  IDBI would, in turn, on-lenl to the four benefi-
ciaries for up to 15 years, including not more than 4 years' grace, at not
less than 10-1/4% interest.
40.       The technical assistance componenit of' the proposed project (US$1
million) would be used to finance the fertilizer demand study and 10-year
forecast mentioned above and the foreign exchange cost of technical studies
on the plant modernization sub-projects. The Governraeiit has also agreed to
complete a study of the long-term transport requirements for fertilizer raw
materials and products by June 30, 1976 (Section 4.04 of Development Credit
Agreement).



Project Costs and Financing
41.       The total project cost is estimated at US&.239 million (including
US$14 million in interest during construction and US$10 million In worling
capital), of which an estimated US$92 million is foreign exchange.    A b-eak-
down of the estimated capital costs is included in Annex III. Since the
project will take advantage of existing infrastructure and complementary
equipment, its capital cost is low relative .o that of a new factory.    Taking
the fertilizer production facilities alone, the capital cost per nutrient
ton of incremental output is about US$650, compared to US$1,050 for a new
plant in India.   The capital cost estimate is based on prices prevailing in
early 1975; it includes provision for physical contingencies of 10% of the
base cost estimate and for price escalation of 18%' of the base cost estimate
and the physical contingencies.
42.       In addition to the IDA credit, the proposed project would be
financed with about US$100.3 million in equity from the enterprises and the
Government and US$33.4 million in long-term loans from Indian financial
institutions and the Government.
Procurement and Disbursement
43.       All equipment and materials financed by the credit would be pro-
cured through international competitive bidding except for up to US$20 mil-
lion for proprietary equipment, items in limited supply which are critical
for the timely completion of the project, and items costing US$100,000 or
less, all of which would be procured through international shopping following
approval by IDA of the items and suppliers involved. Indian equipment sup-
pliers competing under international competitive bidding would be granted a
preference margin of 15% or the current rate of import duty, whichever is less.
It is estimated that about 70% of the value of equipment contracts likely
to be won by Indian bidders will be local currency costs; in that case, the
credit would finance local currency expenditures of about US$25 million.
44.       The proposed credit would be disbursed against the cost of imported
equipment, materials and spare parts (US$62 million), the ex-factory cost of
equipment and services expected to be won by Indian suppliers through inter-
national competition (US$35 million), the foreign exchange cost of technical
assistance, license fees and design engineering (US$7.5 million), and the
initial cost of the long-term fertilizer demand forecast to be undertaken by
Indian consultants (US$0.5 million).
Justification
45.       By removing production bottlenecks and permitting India better to
utilize lher industrial potential, the project represents a significant step
.toward an efficiently operating fertilizer industry.   The project would add
253,000 TPY of nutrients (N and P205), save 31,000 TPY of raw materials,



provide 74,000 TPY of industrial C;c:U-rclC, and acdd 2.5 nzlou .".  o1crud:
oil refining capacity.  Its incremer.~a_ ou- put of fertilizer WGli-U :i  ;
increase India's foodgrain production by about 1.5 million tons annuiba  ,
The financial rate of return for the 17 components whose henel^its nave b;en
quantified (excluding the Zuari anti-pollu-ion sub-project, the pollu;-on
control and testing equipment for FCI, and technical assistance) ranle2i , n
14% to over 60%. Taking the cost and benefit streams of the 17 sub-p.-ojects
together yields a composite financial rate of return for the project c,' 26/'.
46.       The composite economic rate of return for the project, based on
the 17 components with quantifiable benefits, is 32% (ranging from 18% to
over 60%. for individual components), based u,pon a projected 1973 f.o.b.
price of urea of US$160 per ton (in constant 1975 dollars). The economic
value of the additional fertilizer output alone is about US$117 million
annually, and the annual net economic benefit about US$84 million. About
20Z of the project cost i-s for in-plant power generation. While there are
economies of scale in public power generation, power shortages and voltage
fluctuations are expected to continue for some time. These shortages and
fluctuations are harmful to fertilizer equipment and reduce capacity utili-
zation. The steam requirements for power generation are integrated with
the overall steam production of the fertilizer plant, which reduces the
actual cost of in-plant power generation. Although it may not be an optimal
long-term solution, the f'act that capacity utilization is increased at
relatively low cost makes in-plant power generation an economically viable
solution in the medium term.

reasonably well. Details on the execution of individual projects are
below. The level of disbursements was US$480.3 million in FY75 or ,.;5-,
of Bank Group conmnitments to India in that year.  The undisbursed pipeline
of US$1,559.0 million as of October 31, [975, corresponds rouglhly Lo
commitments over the preceding two-year period and reflects the leadtir:e
which would be expected given the mix of fast and slow-disbursing proj ects
in the India program.

This loan to the Tarai Development Corporation is to assist in
the development of seeds of high-yielding varieties. The Corporation is
working efficiently and hias developed a reputation for excellent seed
quality.  Seed production is meeting targets.   Expansion of an existing
processing plant has been completed. Two other plants are being consider-
ably expanded. Bids have recently been cleared for orders to be placed for
the equipment necessary to complete the expansion program. Bids have also
been cleared for special drilling rigs to complete the land development cor-
ponent of the project.

Cr. No. 176     Kadana Irri&ation ProTact; US$35.ulilion cred t of
February 9, 1970; Effective Date:    Juy 29, 1970; Closini
Date: September 30, 1976
This project will finance in part the construction of Kadana Dam
on the Mahi River and the expansion of the irrigated area below the dam. The
project also includes field channel construction, land-leveling, drainage
works and roads, and a program to support agricultural development. The
project will be completed about two years behind schedule because of delays
in dam construction. The agricultural components of the project are also
behind schedule. Some of the delays in implementation occurred at the
start of the project before major investments were made. These will not
affect the economic justification of the project. Further delays have
occurred as a result of building materials shortages. The Government
intervened and made adequate quantities of building materials available.
In spite of an additional delay in the procurement of a large batching
plant, the dam is still expected to be cornpleted in July 1977, which is
in accordance with the revised schedule.
Cr. No. 268     Pochampad Irrigation Project; US$39.0 million credit of
August 23, 1971; Effective Date: tNovember 15, 1971;
Closing Date: March 31, 1977
The project will assist the agricultural development on the right
bank of the Godavari River by providing perennial irrigation to some 100,000
ha. It includes the construction of Pochampad Dam, a concrete-lined main
canal, distributary canals, field channels, drains and roads. Until mid-
1973, overall performance on the project was satisfactory with construction
and disbursements from the IDA credit progressing ahead of schedule. For
two years, acute shortages of construction materials, especially explosives.
for the canal excavation, hampered progress. As a result, construction of
the main canals has fallen about one year behind schedule, which is likely
to delay the introduction of irrigation to over 40% of the project area.
Since the end of 1974, all material shortages have been removed and progress
has been satisfactory. Construction of the dam is ahead of schedule. Land
development, however, is haphazard and increasingly lagging behind water
availability in the project area. Government is aware of the inadequacy of
the operation for land development and has requested IDA financing for a
Command Area Development Project, to be implemented by a Central Authority
for all farmers in need of land development. This project was appraised in
August 1975, as a rnajor component of the proposed Andhra Pradesh Composite
Irrigation and CAD Project, which is scheduled for Board presentation early
in calendar year 1976.

Apart from the Ptnjab project, which consists of mechanization
equipment only, all the above agricultural credit projects are similar in



structure, being designed to provide long- and medium-term credit to fai-
ers through credit institutions for such on-farm investments as imported
tractors, minor irrigation and land-leveling. Disbursement of these
credits started slowly. So far as the minor irrigation components were
concerned, the main difficulties stemmed from the institutional require-
ments, in particular the introduction of changes in lending criteria and
lending terms and the strengthening of institutions responsible for assess-
ing groundwater availability. These constraints have been overcome and dis-
bursements are on schedule. Tractor procurement was delayed following changes
in both the supply and demand situations after the projects were originally
appraised, which prompted GOI to request that indigenous as well as imported
models should be eligible for IDA financing under these credits. The Execu-
tive Directors approved this request in December 1973 and those credits which
have tractor components have been amended accordingly, Tractor procurement
is proceeding satisfactorily. Credit 540 is a continuation nationwide of
the previous program of agricultural credit projects, which were confined
to individual states. ARC will continue to act as the financial intermedi-
ary for refinancing agricultural credit.
Cr. No. 267    Wheat Storage Project; US$5.0 million credit of August 23, 1971;
Effective Date: November 14, 1972; Closing Date: September 30,
1978
This project originally consisted of construction of ten 10,000-
ton capacity godowns and ten 20,000-ton silo units, engineering and consult-
ing services and an All-India Grain Storage Study. However, a July 1974
feasibility study for silos indicated that due to substantial cost increases,
particularly in steel, cement and other materials, the cost of constructing
silos, which represented the bulk of total project costs, would be about
double the original estimates. Also, because the increase in demand for
foodgrains in India has exceeded the increase in foodgrains supply, the
use of silos for buffer stock storage has shifted to their use as bulk
grain receiving, seasonal storage and dispatch facilities. The Food
Corporation of India (FCI), SIDA and IDA have thus agreed on a redesign
of the s410 component that would provide about half the original 200,000
tons of silo storage in five units and, in addition, two to four bulk grain
receiving stations and would also avoid an overrun in project cost. The
economic rate of return of this revised component is about 15%, slightly
more than half the return estimated at the time of original appraisal. In
order to allow sufficient time to complete construction and disbursements
of the silo program, the project closing date has been extended by three
years. The FCI has completed a contract for construction of the silo
foundations at two sites. A tender has been offered for foundations at
three sites. Tenders have been cleared for a part of the equipment. The
godown component has been fully disbursed. In addition, the All-India Grain
Storage Study is progressing and the staff training program has been planned
in detail and is to be implemented soon. Project implementation is now pro-
gressing satisfactorily.



Cr. No. 456    Himachal Pradesh A-ppl'e Processing and Marketing Pro ect
US$$13 million credit of January 22, 1974; Effective Date:
September 26, 1974; Closing Date:   December 31, 1978
This project was designed to promote the development of apple
processing and marketing in Himachal Pradesh, and comprises roads, cold
storage, juice processing, and marketing facilities. The project has
encountered initial delays due to managerial and technical problems, and
implementation has fallen behind schedule. A recent supervision mission
has recommended remedial action, including certain project revisions to
bring it in line with managerial and technical capabilities. Although
the project would be scaled down in some respects, project cost would not
be altered, since there has been a substantial escalation in prices of
equipment since appraisal.   Disbursements should be completed by the pres-
ent closing date. Government's agreement to the mission's recommendations
is currently being sought.
Cr. No. 403     Telecommunications V Project; US$80.0 million credit of
June 25, 1973; Effective Date: July 30, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1976
Disbursements have been delayed mainly because of delays in mate-
rial supply from both local and external sources. Delays in local supply
were due to labor problems affecting one of the principal suppliers and
imports were delayed due to longer than anticipated leadtime required.
Revised disbursement schedules for these two credits are now expected to
be met.
Cr. No. 242    Power Transmission II Project; US$75.0 million credit of

Cr. No. 377    Power Transmission III Project; US$85.0 million credit
of May 9, 1973; Effective Date: October 10, 1973; Closing
Date:  September 30, 1977
Power Transmission II, which is a continuation of the project
financed by Loan 416-IN, was designed to assist in financing the purchase
of equipment and materials required to develop a power transmission program
in nine states under the Fourth Five-Year Plan. Initial delays occurred
because of problems associated with preparing bid documents suitable for
international bidding and the analysis of the very large number of bids
involved, but all contract awards have now been made. As a consequence
of the delays, however, the closing date of the credit had to be postponed
accordingly. For Power Transmission III, virtually all equipment has now
been ordered, and there are likely to be substantial cost overruns.

Ln. No. 1079    IFFCO Fertilizer Project; US$109 million loan of January 24,
1975; Effective Date: April 28, 1975; Closing Date:
March 31, 1979
The Cochin Fertilizer Project is intended to help finance the
expansion of fertilizer manufacturing facilities at Cochin. The project
is now proceeding about 24 months behind schedule, mainly because of pro-
curement delavs, slow progress on civil works, and shortages of steel and
cement. Procurement problems have been largely overcome, and most of the
equipment is either at the site or at the Cochin port. Another factor which
has contributed to the delay has been technical problems in the commission-
ing of the Cochin I plant, which has required a disproportionate amount of
management attention. Credit No. 481 contains funds for a Plant Operations
Improvement Program which will be used in part to overcome these problems;
the use of these funds has been identified on a plant-by-plant basis and
procurement has been initiated. The Gorakhpur project is expected to be
commissioned late in 1975. Engineering work, procurement and site construc-
tion for the Nangal Fertilizer Project are proceeding satisfactorily, but the
project faces substantial cost over-runs due to increases in equipment prices.
Progress on the Trunbay IV project has been good although project completion
may be delayed by about four months because of longer than expected delivery
times for critical equipment. Engineering design and procurement for the
Sindri project are proceeding on schedule. The IFFCO project has been
delayed by about six months as a result of a change in feedstock from fuel
oil to naphtha.

Cr. No. 378    Karnataka Wholesale Agricultural Markets Project; US$8.0 imJ --
lion credit of May 9, 1973; Effective Date: September 7, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
These projects were designed to help with establishment of whole-
sale markets in a number of towns in Bihar and Karrnataka. Progress under
the projects has generally been satisfactory.   IMarkets construction in
Bihar was delayed due to legal challenges arising out of the state's acqui-
sition of land for market sites; however, these difficulties have been satis-
factorily resolved and construction of the first ten markets is well advanced,
Market construction in Karnataka is expected to be on schedule.
Cr. No. 312    Population Project; US$21.2 million credit of June 14, 197)2,
Effective Date: May 9, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
This credit was designed to finance an experimental and research
oriented population project in Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. The project's
infrastructure, which would provide the optimum facilities (buildings, equip-
ment, staff and transport) according to GOI standards in selected districts
in each state, is almost complete. The two Population Centers, which will
design and monitor research aimed at improving the family planning program,
are now functioning. The building program will be largely completed as
scheduled in March 1976.
Cr. No. 342    Agricultural Universities Project; US$12.0 million Credit of
November 10, 1972; Effective Date: June 8, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
The project implementation has improved with satisfactorv progress
on civil works, preparation of equipment lists, bid documents, fellowship
programs and university development plans. The rate of disbursement has
been slow, partly due to previous delays in the selection of key personnel
and in the preparation of equipment lists, but is expected to improve by
FY1976 in line with progressing construction and equipment procurement.
Cr. No. 356     Industrial Development Bank of India Project; US$25.0 million
credit of February 9, 1973; Effective Date: June 22, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The project had a particularly slow start which was mainly due
to institutional problems in the participating State Financial Corporations.
However, there is now evidence of improvement in the utilization of this
credit.



Cr. No. 390    Bombay Water Supply and Sewe-age Project. US$55.0 mill-ion
credit of January 22, 1974; Effective Daze: March 13, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
A substantial cost overrun on the project from US$158 million
equivalent to about US$375 million equivalent has been caused by inflation
and price increases resulting from delays in appointment of engineering con-
sultants and redesign of certain components of the project. Action has been
taken to redefine and rephase the project construction to fit the financing
available from the Credit, local loans and bonds, and internal cash genera-
tion of the project entity. The revised cost estimate for the implementation
period 1975/76 to 1979/80 amounts to US$266 million dollar equivalent exclud-
ing interest during construction. Project construction is proceeding and most
major contracts for civil works, equipment and materials have been awarded.
Financial performance of the project entity during 1974175 was satisfactory,
but major rate increases will be necessary starting in 1976.
Cr. No. 528    Tenth Industrial Imports Project; US$200.0 million credit
February 14, 1975; Effective Date: March 31, 1975; Closing
Date: June 30, 1976
This credit was signed on February 14, 1975, for the initial
tranche of US$100 million and amended to US$200 million on March 7, 1975.
By the end of December 1975, disbursements had reached US$154.6 million.
Cr. No. 427    Calcutta Urban Development Project; US$35.0 million credit
of September 12, 1973; Effective Date: January 10, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Progress in implementation of this project was rather slow during
the first construction season (1973174) in view of the reduction in overall
funding of the CMDA program and of organizational problems, but project im-
plementation and credit disbursements have now improved. However, project
costs have increased considerably, especially for subprojects in the water
supply and sewerage/drainage sectors. In order to accommodate the project
size to funding available, CMDA has submitted a redefined project, which is
expected to be completed by May 1977, six months behind the original sched-
ule.

credit of December 13, 1974; Effective Date: July '3 -
Closing Date: June 30    i982
These three credit:s totaling US$74.1 million support dairy
development projects organized along the lines of the successful ANIUL
dairy cooperative scheme irA Gujarat State.  Progress on tne Karnataka
project has been slow, partly because of .iadequate staffing off the
Karnataka Dairy Development Corporation (KDDC) and partly due to poor
project management. However, impprovement in implementation is expec'cuc
with the recent recruitment by KDDC of a frianagement consultant.  Trainri;.
has progressed with the completion of a two-rininth trailnng prograrm by 66,
field staff. Overall, the project is six months behind the original s, ea-
ule. Progress under the Madhya Pradesh project is sacisfactory, with    .
i4adhya Pradesh Dairy Development Corporation having been establsi--ed cv.d
all key staff positions filled. Field staff training hlas commeniced ,anL
the first dairy cooperative societies should be established by Decenber,
1975.  Detailed design studies for plant construction have begun; and  :.r-
struction is expected to begin soon. With respect to the Rajasthari prejJe!ct,
the Rajastthan Dairy Development Corporation has been formed and key personel
appointed.  The first milk union has been formed and good progress has been
made in organizing dairy cooperatives at the village level.

The project provides credit over 4 years for construction of about
18,000 shallow tubewells, 300 deep tubewells, 200 agro-srrvice centers -und
3 markets.  The credit also helps the state to finance th; completion of a
number of state-owned river lift and deep tubeweli schemes and to improve
agricultural extension and maintenance facilities    P :rticipating balnks
