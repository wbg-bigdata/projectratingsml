MEMORANDUM AND RECOHH3DAT?ION OF T?R  PRSIDUNT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMZNT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUATEMALA
FOR A MUNICIPAL D&VELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan to the Government of Guatemala for
the equivalent of US$29 million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would
have a term of 17 years, including five years of grace, with interest at the
standard variable interest rate.
2.       Background.  The urban population of Guatemala has gzown twice as fast as
the rural population and now constitutes about 402 of the total compared to 25Z in
1950. The largest population growth has taken place in the metropolitan area of
Guatemala City. With 1.7 million people, the metropolitan area accounts for about
half the urban population and is 20 times larger than either of the two largest
secondary cities. It is presently estimated that about 20Z of the metropolitan
population lives in squatter settlements, without even basic municipal services.
3.       The Municipality of Guatemala is dominated by an administrative
environment which is no longer compatible with the size of the city and its
importance to the nation. The financial performance of the Municipality has been
compromised by a marked deterioration in the effectiveness of its tax-management
systems. For lack of adequate financial resources, investment planning has not
been undertaken by the Municipality on any systematic basis since a master plan was
prepared for the metropolitan area in the mid-1970's. With annual expenditures on
road maintenance and improvement running at only about US$0.5 million per year on
average for a total road network of 1,100 kms, the status of the road network has
been seriously impaired by almosc two decades of neglect. Total annual capital
investments by the Municipality have been l'uited to only about US$5 equivalent per
capita/year in recent years and mainly fo: water supply improvements, leaving most
municipal services unattended. As a result of this low level of Investment, poor
service planning decisions and low operational efficiency, deterioration of
services has reached crisis levels.
4.       The Government's urban strategy involves a dual approach of improving the
management of services in the Capital together with initiating a policy of
delegating more responsibilities for the provision of basic infrastructure and
services to municipalities outside the metropolitan area of Guatemala City. As
part of this effort, the new Constitution provides for the transfer of eight
percent of the Government's annual revenues to all municipalities in the country to
support their investment programs.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project supports the Bank's
lending strategy which is oriented toward increasing the resources devoted to basic
services and strengthening the responsible public institutions to enable them to
provide services efficiently, plan and execute investment programs economically,
and generate an adequate share of their financing requirements. Drawing on the
experience gained under the Earthquake Reconstruction Project (Loan 1314/5-T-GU,
completed after significant delays in 1983), added emphasis is given to a strong
participation of non-Governmental organizations (NGO's) in the project which is
expected to contribute to a more efficient project implementation. In view of the
importance of Guatemala City to the nation's economy and the existing heavy
concentration of the target poverty group, improvement of municipal management and
services in Guatemala City is a priority. A subsequent project, under preparation,
would address the development of infrastructure and institutions in the main
secordAary cities.



6.       Project Obiectives.  The proposed project seeks to achieve objectives in
two priority areas. Firstly, through action programs, the project vould strengthen
local resource mobilization, streamline organizational arrangements and install
modern city planning and management systems, together with improved maintenance
operations in the Municipality of Guatemala. Secondly, the project would address
social needs in the Capital through provision or rehabilitation of basic urban
infrastructure and community services to low-income and squatter communities, in
part through community action.
7.       Project Description.  The proposed project, to be carried out over six and
one half years, would have the following components: (a) institutional devplopment
in the Municipality of Guatemala (US$2.9 million) through: (i) updating the
c.dastre as a basis to increase revenues from taxes on property and (ii) consultant
services to improve the organization in the Munici;ality, personnel management,
training and career development, revenue administration, budgetary management and
financial and municipal investment planning, together with data management and
office equipment; (b) urban services (US$35.1 million) through: (i) a pilot program
to provide basic services (water supply, drainage, road paving and community
facilities) and home improvement and small business loans to about 6,500 families
in five squatter communities; (ii) rehabilitation and reconstruction of basic
utility infrastructure (water supply, drainage and road paving) and provision of
(essential) community facilities for about 140,000 to 160,000 people, most ot whom
fall within the poverty group, in 32 existing residential communities, and
technical assistance to formulate an operational program to address nationwide
shelter deficiencies; and (iii) technical assistance to help install improved
planning and management systems for road maintenance; a program of maintenance and
improvement works covering about 186 kms in the principal transportation corridcrs
and the central business district; and purchase of maintenance equipment; and (c)
metropolitan planning (US$0.9 million) through: a metropolitan planning study to
identify medium-term investment priorities and improve operational efficiency of
the public passenger transit system in the metropolitan area.
8.       The Municipality of Guatemala would be responsible for implementing, with
consultant assistance, the institutional development component, the road
maintenance and improvement program and the metropolitan planning study. The
squatter upgrading and infrastructure rehabilitation program in low-income
residential communities would be implemented by the National Committee for
Reconstruction (CRN) under a contract with the Government and with assistance from
exper'enced NGO's. The total cost of the project, including the project
preparation facility (PPF) and before interest during construction, is eszimated at
US$38.9 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$16.2 million
(422). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, as well as the disbursement
schedule, are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Guatemala are given in Schedules C and
D, respectively. A map showing project locations is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 6410-GU, dated June 1, 1988, is being distributed separately.
9.       Agreed Actions.  US$14.1 million equivalent would be onlent to the
Municipality of Guatemala on the same terms as the loan to the Government. The
Municipality would take the full exchange and interest risk on the loan. The
balance of US$14.9 million equivalent would be made available as budgetary
appropriations to CRN. The Municipality would provide, from internally generated
resources, funds sufficient to finance an increasing proportion of its overall
investr'-nt needs including the project, starting at 15% in 1989 and increasing to
not less than 40Z in 1992 and thereafter. To achieve this, the cadastre would be
updated during the period 1989 to 1993. Also, both the Municipality and the
Government would establish line-item budgets for the counterpart requirements of



the project, and the adequacy of allocations would be reviewed annually by the
Bank. In addition, the H4unicipe.lity would, each year, review with the Bank its
financial performance and prospects in the context of an overall financial plan.
To facilitate provision of urban services for low-income residential communities,
inter-institutional agreements to define the role and responsibilities of each
participating agency would be signed prior to loan effectiveness. All required
land transfers to the executing agency (CRN) for urban upgrading works programmed
fcr the first year of implementation would be completed prior to loan
effectiveness. Implementation agreements would be signed with all participating
NGO's prior to loan effectiveness. Following improvement works, clear title wotid
be provided in the squatter communities to all beneficiary families involved.
10.      Benefits.  A broad range of benefits would accrue from the proposed
project. Increased municipal revenues resulting from the updated cadastre would
enable the Municipality of Guatemala to plan infrastructure investments at a scale
more in line with service needs, and to finance them increasingly from internally
generated resources. At the same time, starting under the project, high priority
road maintenance and improvements works would result in savings in spare parts and
fuel, and remedy the effects of two decades of neglect which has imposed higher
costs on the busines,s community at large, and on passenger transport operators in
particular for whom Government subsidies have been required on an annual basis.
Investments in urban services would initiate a new era in Government support for
the urban poor. The pilot program in squatter upgrading would demonstrate
approaches to providing basic services and clear title on a cost recoverable and
affordable basis from the communities involved. It would also mobilize
participation by NGO's which have established expertise in low-ircome community
development. Rehabilitation of infrastructure at housing sites would benefit about
140,000 to 160,000 people, and it would enable these sites to be transferred to
municipal and utility agencies in order that programming of infrastructure
maintenance can be regularized. Based on reductions in vehicle operating costs
resulting from road maintenance and improvement works, and increased land and
property values resulting from the provision/rehabilitation of infrastructure in
low-income residential communities, the project as a whole would hav_ an economic
rate of return well in excess of the opportunity cost of capital, estimated at
10Z-122.
11.      Risks.  The first project risk relates to the ability of the Municipality
to provide the counterpart funds required for project implementation. This risk
has been substantially reduced through the recently approved participation of the
municipalities in the Central Government revenues.  To further minimize this risk,
the Municipality has adopted a financial strategy centered around implementation of
an updated cadastre which, within four to five years, would generate additional
revenues at a level nct only sufficient to meet the needs of the project, but also
to finance additional future investments. A second risk relates to little in-
country experience with the squatter upgrading component. To minimize the risk,
this co...ponent has been restricted to a "pilot" scale effort.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
