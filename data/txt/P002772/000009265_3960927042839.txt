MEMIORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
FOR A NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL AND
LIVESTOCK EXTENSION REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.     The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the United Republic of Tanzania for SDR 13.7 million
(US$18.4 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed
credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would help
finance the first phase of a long-term program to rehabilitate extension
services in Tanzania. Cofinancing of the project by AfD7 for US$8.8
million equivalent has already been secured.
2.     Background.  Development of the agricultural sector, which accounts
for about 50 percent of GNP, 75 percent of exports, and 80 percent of
employment, is critical to the economy. However, for more than a decade up
to the mid-1980s, agriculture was neglected in Tanzania as the Government
favored urban industrial growth, based on extensive state ownership and
regulation of the economy. As a consequence, agricultural output declined
and the country was increasingly unable to feed itself. In addition,
agricultural exports, the country's main source of foreign e-schange
earnings, fell steadily, contributing to the growing balance of payments
difficulties. The economy overall stagnated, leading the Government to
adopt an Economic Recovery Program (ERP) in June, 1986, and to implement a
far-reaching structural adjustment program supported by an IMF stand-by
agreement and an IDA Multi Sector Rehabilitation Credit. A second year
Policy Framework Paper (PFP), covering above program, was approved in
November 1988.
3.     With assistance from IDA and other donors, Tanzania has prepared and
is pursuing a revised strategy in the agricultural sector. This strategy
includes improvements in pricing and marketing policy, both for inputs and
output, and improvements in agricultural services, e.g., credit, research
and extension, marketing and distribution systems. Emphasis is being
placed on producer incentives to encourage production of basic staples
(grains particularly) for domestic consumption and cash crops for export
(tea, coffee, cashew, and coconuts). Surpluses of maize may also become
available for export. Institutional improvements are being developed to
improve the effectiveness of service delivery. Smallholders are receiving
increased attention under the revised strategy. IDA is assisting in the
implementation of the above strategy with a number of projects, including
the proposed National Agricultural and Livestock Extension Rehabilitation
Project, and is helping the Government to mobilize and coordinate donor
assistance in support of this strategy.
4.     Agriculture and livestock extension services are extremely weak in
Tanzania at the present time. In the first place, the services are
provided by two separate entities in the Ministry of Agriculture and
Livestock Development (MALD), resulting in lack of coordination and costly
duplication of ar lvities. Funds for both research and extension are
inadequate, as is training; and staff morale is low. Linkages between
research and extension are virtually non-existent and contacts with farmers
are highly sporadic and infrequent. Therefore, there is little



- 2 -
dissemination, of existing technical packages and know-how to farmers by the two
services. Cdrrently, many donors such as the EEC, FAO, IFAD, UNDP, the Federal
Republic of Germany, the Netherlands and Japan support the agricultural sector
and are especially involved in extension acLivities meant to improve production
and yields. However, their activities are adversely affected by the present
situation, which substantially reduces the planned impact of their programs.
5.     The Government has recognized the need to establish a more efficient and
cost-effective extension system to ensure a steady flow of improved technology
to the farming community, including messages in agroforestry, erosion control
and other environment conservation measures. As part of its African
Agricultural Services Initiative, IDA assisted MALD to set up a pilot extension
operation based on the Training and Visit methodology. This pilot operation
demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed organization and extension
methodology and it verified the strong interest and eagerness of farmers to
receive technical support. It also confirmed the importance of a focus on
women farmers to maximize the diffusion of the new technical messages and it
identified the interest of NGO's in participating in field activities. On the
basis of this pilot program and other donor experiences in extension
activities, the Government, with IDA assistance, prepared the proposed project
to complement the National Agricultural and Livestock Research Project, which
is the first project in Africa supported by the Special Program for African
Agricultural Research (SPAAR). In addition, it would strengthen the Impact of
the policy measures (dealing basically with pricing and marketing) designed to
increase agricultural production and incomes which are being introduced as part
of the ERP.
6.     Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Because of its extensive experience in
assisting countries in improving their extension services, particularly through
the Training and Visit methodology, IDA's involvement in this project is
essential. In addition, IDA was involved in the design and implementation of
the pilot operation on which this project is based and thus has an adequate
background epecifically in the Tanzanian environment. Moreover, IDA has been
assisting Tanzania in formulating the overall agricultural sectoral strategy,
of which this project is an integral part. IDA's participation is, therefore,
necessary to ensure the smooth and effective implementation of the GOT's
agricultural strategy and the introduction of a new extension methodology.
7.     Project Objectives.  The project aims to rehabilitate and consolidate
existing extension services into one efficient and cost-effective system able
to disseminate appropriate agricultural technologies to farmers, thereby
enabling them to increase agricultural production and rural incomes. In
particular, the project would focus on: (a) gradual, steady and well-planned
unification of crop and livestock extension services into a multidiL.iplinary
system; (b) strengthening of the organization, coordination, management, and
supervision of extension activities; and (c) upgrading and/or provision of
necessary human resources, physical infrastructure, and logistical support.
8.         Project Description.  The proposed project would strengthen MALD's
capacity to plan, carry out and supervise extension activities through
training, logistical support and technical assistance. The project, to be
carried out over 8 years, would provide investment and incremental financing
for: (a) establishment of an appropriately streamlined organization and
management structure, capable of providing leadership, and based on a single
chain of command from headquarters to the field; (b) introduction of a
cost-effective extension methodology to enhance the adoption of improved
technologies by project participants; (c) acquisition and maintenance of new or



- 3 -
upgraded physical infrastructure, including housing ard training facilities,
equipment and materials, and vehicles to enable staff to attain a higher degree
of coverage of the farming community. (d) strengthening of MALD's
implementation capacity through the provision of technical assistance; and
(e) preparation of the second phase of the agricultural and livestock extension
rehabilitation process. The total cost of the project is estimated at USS30.4
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$20.8 million
(68%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
The amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable ,of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Tanzania are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map of Tanzania (IBRD Nc- 20852), and
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7366-TA dated January 12, 1989, are attached.
9.     Agreed Actions.  IDA reached agreements with GOT on the following
matters: (a) establishment of an Extension Unit in MALD, and the nomination of
the Commissioner for Agriculture and Livestock Development, and the Assistant
Commissioner for Extension Services; (b) design of an action plan for the
coordination of extension activities in ongoing agricultural development
projects and programs by November 30, 1989; (c) design and preparation of
implementation schedules for the project's Management Information System and
Overall Evaluation System six months after Credit effectiveness; (d) joint
GOT/IDA, design and carrying out of a project implementation review at the end
of the third project year; and (e) provision of adequate budgetary allocations
to MALD to cover in full extension recurrent costs by the eighth year of the
project, and thereafter.
10.    Benefits.  The proposed project is expected to improve the delivery of
technology to a large portion of the Tanzanian farming community, which should
lead to increases in yield levels for both staple food and export crops. The
project would thereby raise rural incomes and employment and contribute towards
the national objectives of self-sufficiency in staple foods and increased
export earnings from the agricultural sector. Moreover, the project will help
accelerate the integration of women in the economy, and the involvement of NGOs
in the agricultural sector.
11.    Risks.  Main project risks include organizational difficulties, lower
than expected adoption rates of technical recommendations by farmers, and
inadequate local funding. To minimize these risks, the project would:
(a) provide for adequate technical assistance to help the rehabilitation
process; and (b) taking into consideration the results of the pilot operation
and other donor experience in extension, improve systematically the design of
*       extension activities to relate extension messages more closely to farmer needs,
strengthen extension-research linkages, and provide adequate staff and farmer
training and supervision. On the question of inadequate local funding,
assurances were received from the GOT that it would provide the required
budgetary resources timely and consistent with the Public Expenditure Review.
12.    1 am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles
of Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.
