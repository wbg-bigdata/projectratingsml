                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the pilot program is to improve the process for identification and use of state lands transferred to eligible, poor and formerly landless or
                         land-poor recipients selected through a transparent and well-targeted process as indicated by:
                         (a) the adoption rates of improved land management and agricultural production systems in SLC sub-projects;
                         (b) proportion of land recipients which meet poverty criteria and were landless or land-poor prior to project interventions;
                         (c) the effective implementation of dispute resolution procedures under the project, related to challenges to the land recipient selection process.

                         The project continues to make good progress towards achieving its development objective. The process for identification and use of state land to poor and formerly land-less
                         recipients has improved considerably as demonstrated by the adoption rates, number of land recipients and effective implementation of dispute resolution procedures. All land
                         recipients who have settled in the six social land concession (SLC) sites are adopting backyard and agricultural farming using improved agricultural practices learned as a result of
                         the project. To date, 9,109.93 hectares (91% of the target) have been registered as state private lands and another 1,500 hectares are being processed for registration. A total of

                         2,285 land recipients (76% of the target) have been selected and another 863 land recipients are being selected. With this level of accomplishment, the project targets of 10,000
                         hectares of registered land and 3,000 land recipients are achievable. The project has also proven that a well targeted and transparent process can be done in the identification and
                         use of state lands transferred to eligible, poor and formerly landless or land-poor recipients.
