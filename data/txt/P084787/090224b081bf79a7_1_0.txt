                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the pilot program is to improve the process for identification and use of state lands transferred to eligible, poor and formerly landless or
                         land-poor recipients selected through a transparent and well-targeted process as indicated by:
                         (a) the adoption rates of improved land management and agricultural production systems in SLC sub-projects;
                         (b) proportion of land recipients which meet poverty criteria and were landless or land-poor prior to project interventions;
                         (c) the effective implementation of dispute resolution procedures under the project, related to challenges to the land recipient selection process.

                         The project continues to make good and steady progress towards achieving its development objective and its continuing relevance in line with the Government Social Land
                         Concession Program. Being a pilot project, activities and accomplishments have provided good lessons learned for future social land concessions (SLC) sites. The process for
                         identification and use of state land to poor and formerly land-less recipients has improved considerably as demonstrated by the adoption rates, number of land recipients (LR) and
                         effective implementation of dispute resolution procedures. All the land recipients were selected based on the agreed criteria as per the Project Implementation Manual (PIM). All land

                         recipients who have settled in the seven SLC sites are adopting backyard and agricultural farming using improved agricultural technology learned in project-sponsored training and
                         demonstration plots. To date, 10,273.13 hectares (102.73% of the target) have been completely registered as state private lands for all Land Allocation for Social and Economic
                         Development (LASED) SLC sites. A total of 3,148 land recipients (104% of the target) have been completely selected for all LASED SLC sites, of which the land has been used as
                         follow: (i) 5,517 hectares (53.7%) for agricultural lands, 265.7 hectares (2.6%) for residential lands, and 1,725.4 hectares (16.8%) for public infrastructures, and the balance of
                         2,765.03 hectares (26.9%) have been used for forest and reserved lands. With this level of accomplishment, the project targets of 10,000 hectares registered land and 3,000 land
                         recipients are over achieved. The project has also proven that a well targeted and transparent process can be done in the identification and use of state lands transferred to eligible,
                         poor and formerly landless or land-poor recipients.
