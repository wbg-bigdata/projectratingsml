POST-SECONDARY EDUCATION
Overview
1.        China has launched a drive to modernize its economy, raise people's
living standards and remedy the damages caused by the economic mismanagement
of the previous decade. The emphases are on education, science, agriculture,
energy and transport. The Government views education as the key to modern-
ization because the lack of trained manpower is a serious constraint on the
country's economic development. The shortage stems from the disruption of
higher education during the Cultural Revolution, when radical policies caused
the closure of schools and universities. As a result, China has lost an
estimated 2 million technicians and 1 million college and university graduates
who would otherwise have been graduated during the 'ate 1960s and early 1970s.
2.        Manpower requirements are being revised in light of recent Govern-
ment economic reforms. But the most recent projections of requirements for
graduate level manpower indicate a special problem in science and engineering,
where the present flow of university graduates (30,000 a year) will meet only
30% of the estimated yearly requirements during the coming decade. Even
considering the output from the nonformal system, the current supply of
qualified labor in science and engineering can satisfy no more than half the
demand for graduates. The shortage of economists, social scientists and
lawyers in China is even more acute. Only about 12% of all university
students in China are enrolled in liberal arts and social sciences. As for
middle-level technicians, the current output from full-time institutions of
50,000 a year only meets about 25% of the estimated annual requirements.
3.        Government Strategy.  To alleviate the manpower shortage and
increase access to higher education, the Government decided to: (a) expand
existing conventional universities; (b) establish a system of polytechnics,/l
which would offer postsecondary technical education to recent middle-school
graduates; and (c) expand the Television University (TVU) system, primarily
aimed at upgrading the skills of currently employed workers. The Government
has started to improve conventional universities with Bank Group assistance
(Ln. 2021/Cr. 1167-CHA). However, expansion of the conventional university
system is limited by constraints that cannot be removed immediately (Annex 2).
The Government is now diversifying the production of graduates by expanding
the TVU system and establishing polytechnics to produce middle-level
technicians. These systems are faster and less costly means of expanding
post-secondary education than conventional universities. They will benefit
from new policies that are being introduced - the polytechnics will be
nonresidential, levy fees and permit student choice in future employment, and
/1 The Chinese term is "Short-term Vocational College." The word "short-
term" refers to the duration of study, which is two to three years
compared to four in a university.



- 2 -
the TVU will enroll an increasing proportion of recent middle-school graduates
as the need for in-service upgrading declines. The Government plans to double
enrollment in higher education by 1990, and to triple the enrollment ratio by
the end of the century, by increasing enrollment of conventional universities,
polytechnics and the TVU to 2 million each. The project would assist the
Government in developing the polytechnic and TVU systems.
Conventional Universities
4.        There are 1.3 million students in about 700 formal higher educa-
tion institutions classified into two categories: (a) 518 four-year
universities and colleges with an enrollment of 1.1 million that award a
bachelor's or higher degree; and (b) 186 two to three year "specialized
colleges," with an enrollment of 0.2 million which award postsecondary
diplomas in technical education. Students are admitted on the basis of
their scores on a uniform national entrance examination, and less than 5% of
the applicants gain admission. The enrollment ratio for formal higher
education in China is only 2.1%, compared with 4-5% in other developing
countries. In addition, there are 506,000 students enrolled in technical
schools. These schools and the specialized colleges are not meeting the
needs for technician level manpower associated with rapid industrial devel-
opment and modernization, because of poor organizational design, relatively
high cost of residential students, narrowness of curriculum, outmoded
equipment and shortage of qualified faculty. A new type of college, the
polytechnic, is emerging to meet the need.
Polytechnic Syst-em (Annex 3)
5.        Polytechnics are designed to produce middle-level technicians, by
offering two to three years of technical education to residents of a
locality and to gear outpult towards satisfying local demands. They will
offer access to higher education for students who fail to secure a place in
a conventional university after taking the national entrance examination.
The Government is launching the first phase of this program with 17
polytechnics, some of which have already begun to admit students, and plans
to establish about one hundred by 1990. Most polytechnics are being
converted from existing educational institutions.  These institutions
require considerable upgrading before they can function properly. Their
emergence reflects important government policy changes towards making higher
education nonresidential and creating a labor market. In contrast to
conventional university graduates who are assigned jobs upon completion of
studies, graduates of the polytechnics would not be guaranteed jobs by the
state or locality (though they would be assisted by a local employment
service). Polytechnics show promise to be more efficient than conventional
universities, both educationally and economically, because: (a) no
residential facilities would be provided, thereby overcoming the principal
enrollment constraint of conventional colleges and universities and
eliminating a major cost factor; (b) new sources of funding would be tapped,



including a combination of modest student fees and municipal and provincial
funding; (c) a more comprehensive, relevant and practical curriculum would
be established, thus increasing class size and promoting efficient use of
facilities and staff; and (d) the technicians produced will receive
training that is practical rather than theoretical, and relevant because
based on local needs. Close coordination with local enterprises, directly
or indirectly through the Provincial Planning Commissions, has helped to
identify priority fields of study.
Television University System (Annex 4)
6.        In 1981, 1,763 nonformal institutions offered higher education to
1,350,000 workers under various forms: factory-run institutes, spare-time
(or part-time) universities, TVW, correspondence courses and evening
courses. The Government has given much attention to the TVU system in
recent years because it can achieve economies of scale and increase enroll-
ments quickly in fields where the need for graduates becomes urgent. It can
also afford to bring the best teachers to students and develop sophisticated
methods of teaching through various media. Of 110,000 full-time students
admitted in 1979, 69% obtained the equivalent of college degrees after three
years. More than 90% of the students are employees of factories and other
government units who have passed a TVU entrance examination. Most full-
time TVU students are released either full or part time from work to attend
classes. Recent secondary school graduates who take the entrance
examination for admission to conventional universities and colleges and
score just below the cut-off point can also be admitted to the TVU. In
addition, an estimated 5-6 million free viewers (unregistered students)
watch such programs as TV English language.
7.        The TVU system was started in the early 1960s to train science
teachers but was closed during the Cultural Revolution. It resumed
broadcasting in 1979 with the establishment of a Central Radio and
Television University (CRTVU) and 28 provincial television universities
(PTVUs). The CRTVU is administered by the Ministry of Education in
cooperation with the Ministry of Broadcasting. The PTVUs are administered
and funded by provincial governments and local enterprises. The PTVUs
operate 500 branch schools, study centers /1 and work stations,/2 and 14,000
TV classes.
/1  The branch school is the PTVIWs biggest field unit usually serving a
city or prefecture. Most PTVUs house a study center comprising class-
rooms, laboratories and audio-visual centers in addition to
PTVU program production and administrative facilities.
/2 The work station is controlled by a branch school or directly by the
PTVU. It is located in a factory, mine, or local government bureau that
supports it financially. It supervises TV classes usually located in
factories.



- 4 -
8.        The CRTVIJ broadcasts 33 hours of educational programs a week
through the national television network. It also distributes audio
cassettes and booklets to the TV classes and organizes examinations. The
CRTVU provides a unified curriculum of 28 courses in science and technology
and 22 in social sciences and arts. A few PTVUs offer additional courses of
their own. The television lectures are supplemented by face-to-face tutor-
ing at work stations, for which instructors are recruited from factories and
nearby higher education institutions. Laboratory work is done at the branch
schools and work stations, or if facilities are not available, at labora-
tories in other colleges and universities, often for a fee per student.
Constraints to Development of the Polytechnic and TVU Systems
9.        The polytechnics system is constrained by:  (a) inadequate facili-
ties and equipment: since tlhe polytechnics are converted from existing
institutions that offered narrow specializations, they lack facilities and
equipment required for a broad program; (b) low staff qualifications
(Annex 3f): of the full-time teaching staff only 3% have had postgraduate
education, and 50% have had less than five years of teaching experience. Of
the part-time teachers hired from other colleges and industries, about 6%
have had postgraduate educatiLon. There is also a shortage of experienced
administrators to operate the polytechnics; and (c) irrelevant curriculum
(Annex 3d): existing polytechnics offer a theoretically oriented curriculum
that is an abridged version of a curriculum in a regular university.
Instructional programs need 'Further refinement to suit the purposes of the
polytechnics.
10.       The TVU system is constrained by:  (a) limited program production
capacity: TVUs depend on sparse facilities of their own and limited studio
facilities provided by broadcasting authorities. They are capable of pro-
ducing only simple TV and radio programs; (b) lack of transmission
capability: additional broadcasting time, at hours suitable for students,
is not available on the national television and radio network. In most
PTVUs, alternative delivery means, such as cable or videocassette machines,
do not exist. As a result of these shortages, PTVUs cannot admit students
every year, creating gaps in enrollment in some years; (c) inadequate space
and equipment: PTVUs lack laboratories and teaching space of an adequate
standard. Only 20-30% of experimental work required in the curricula can be
conducted. Most PTVUs do not: have microcomputers for teaching computer
literacy and simple programming. PTVUs also lack suitable office
facilities, computers for data processing, and modern office equipment; and
(d) poorly trained staff:  the qualifications of program-making staff
(academics, curriculum developers, video and audio producers, and technical
staff) are inadequate. There are also shortages of technicians trained to
operate and maintain high technology equipment, educational computing
specialists, and qualified ttLtors and administrators.

Bank Group Strategy in Education
11.       In support of the Government-s strategy (para. 3), the first
University Development Project (Ln. 2021/Cr. 1167-CHA) aims to increase the
output and improve the quality of teaching and research in science and
engineering at 28 leading universities. The second educaticn project
(Cr. 1297-CHA) is designed to increase the output and improve the quality
of teaching and research at 18 agricultural colleges and research
institutes. Implementation of both projects has been generally smooth,
with good portions of project funds being disbursed or committed in the
first year. Project indicators also show that progress is being made
toward reaching project objectives. Although both projects would increase
enrollment, their thrust is quality improvement because quantity expansion
on a large scale is not feasible under the conventional university system.
The university education sector alone cannot satisfy future skilled manpower
demands. Hence the Bank Group also supports the Government's policy of
providing technical education to a wide segment of the population through
the polytechnic and TVU systems. Through these two systems, it is projected
that the gross enrollment ratio of higher education in the year 2000 would
be triple the current ratio of 3.1%. Appraisal has been completed for a
second project in agricultural education and is scheduled for a second
university development project. The Government is discussing additional
future projects in teacher training, secondary vocational schools, and
social sciences at the university level.
THE PROJECT
Project Objectives and Scope
12.       The project would assist the Government to increase the output and
improve the quality of skilled technical manpower for its economic
modernization program by support for two cost-effective systems of
postsecondary education - the polytechnic and TVU systems. In the poly-
technics, the project would contribute to the development of three new
policies in higher education - (i) nonresidential institutions, (ii) student
fees, and (iii) elimination of the guarantee of job assignment for
graduates./l These policies are aimed at removing obstacles that have
hindered development in the conventional system.  Specific objectives of the
proposed project would be to:
(a) increase the output of technicians from 17 polytechnics, a first
phase development for this type of education, and expand the
enrollment capacity of the TVU system;
/1  Students with good grades will be recommended by the polytechnic to local
enterprises and units for employment.



- 6 -
(b) raise t'he quality, scope and relevance of instruction; and
(c) improve the standards of management in both systems.
The project institutions would work towards targets to be attained by the end
of the project with respect to student-teacher ratios, the number of speciali-
zations and courses, space utilization and others (Annex 6).
13.       The project would consist of the following components:
(a)  Polytechnic System:  establishment or improvement of 17
polytechlnics, including construction or renovation, furnishing and
equipping of facilities; provision of staff development for both
academic and administrative staff;
(b) Television University System: (i) CRTVU: construction of, and
provision of furniture and equipment for, a production center,
laboratories and a printing house; and provision of technical
assistanice. (ii) PTVUs: construction or rehabilitation of, and
provision of furniture and equipment for, 9 (major) broadcast-
standard production centers, 19 (minor) nonbroadcast-standard
producti'on centers, and 85 study centers; and provision of tech-
nical assistance; and (iii) transmission stations:  construction
of, and provision of equipment for, 9 TV transmission stations;
and provision of technical assistance; and
(c) Evaluation, planning and preparation of future projects.
The Polytechnic System (Annex 3)
14.       Assistance would be provided to develop 17 polytechnics located in
urban population centers, which will produce technical graduates essential
to China's industrial development (para. 5). The project would support the
polytechnics to increase enrollment, improve the quality and relevance of
instruction, and improve management. During this initial phase of polytech-
nic development, the Government would implement new policies (para. 12)
that would reduce costs and introduce market forces to direct student demand
in education and f'uture emp'Loyment. The absence of boarding is expected to
reduce capital and' recurrent costs by 35%. Collection of student tuition
(Y 50/student, or about 7% of the 1981 average wage per worker in urban
areas) would also reduce the financial burden on local governments, and its
impact on student demand would be studied.
15.       Increasing Enrollment (Annex 3c).  There are currently 7,000
students at the 10 existing polytechnics. Enrollment is expected to
increase at least sixfold to about 45,000 students at the 17 project
institutions by the end of the project. Increased enrollment and output
would be achieved primarily by provision of new facilities, including



-7-
libraries, laboratories and classrooms, as well as some rehabilitation. The
total area available for instruction at the end of the project would be
about 270,000 sq m (with new construction accounting for 45% of the total),
which conforms to average standard space requirements per student.
16.       Raising the Quality of Instruction.  Gains in the quality of
instruction would be attained by the combination of improved facilities
(para. 15), acquisition of modern teaching equipment, curriculum develop-
ment, and a program of staff development and expert services (Annex 5).
17.       Equipment acquisitions would comprise basic equipment and
instruments needed for individual students and smaller numbers of standard
and advanced laboratory equipment, usually used by groups of students.
Laboratory equipment and computers would provide students with "hands-on"
experience. Library acquisitions would include reference books and foreign
language materials. Other equipment would include audiovisual equipment
(such as video playback systems, monitors and projectors) and teaching aids,
as well as language laboratory equipment (Annex 3g).
18.       The curriculum presently used in the polytechnics is essentially
an abridged version of a university curriculum. It needs to be further
developed to suit the requirements of a technician training program, with
emphasis on practical work rather than theoretical studies. In response to
local manpower and employment needs, the project would include the
development of a range of specializations in business management, economics
and engineering (Annex 3d). Of particular concern is the relevance of the
curriculum to nearby industries; this aspect would be closely monitored and
frequent contacts between polytechnics and local industries would be
promoted.
19.       The program of staff development (Annex 5) for polytechnic
teaching staff would include local and overseas fellowships, study tours and
seminars. The program for fellowships and study tours would include
training in basic sciences, computer sciences, business management, commerce
and engineering. Seminars would be conducted locally by experts financed
under the project for groups of polytechnics with common fields of study.
Selected polytechnic staff would attend the seminars and would subsequently
train other staff at their institutions. The seminars would cover areas
such as curriculum development, the use of advanced computers and
science/engineering equipment, and teaching methods that make best use of
audiovisual aids.
20.       Improved management would be addressed through a staff development
program including short-term foreign and local training for administrators
and expert services in management. Particular areas that need attention at
the polytechnics, and which would be a focus of the staff development
component, are maintenance of student and financial records; scheduling of
classes to optimize use of space and equipment; and administration of



- 8 -
computer centers, libraries and audiovisual centers. An overall goal of
management improvement is to attain a 15:1 student-teacher ratio by the end
of the project.
The Television University System (Annex 4)
2l.       Support would be provided to the TVU system at both the national
and provincial levels to expand its coverage and increase enrollment;
enhance the scope, quality and relevance of programs; and improve
management.
22.       Expanded           and Output.  The TVU system would increase its
coverage and enrollment by alleviating the -present constraint of
insufficient broadcast time. It would do this by: (a) diversifying methods
of program delivery; (b) establishing additional transmission capacity; and
(c) establishing experimental study groups in rural areas.
23.       Under the project, the CRTWTJ would reduce its heavy reliance on TV
broadcasts and produce courses using other media such as video and audio-
cassettes and printed materials (Annexes 4c and 4d). Programs not broadcast
by the CRTVU would be either transported by air or land, or transmitted via
microwave to provincial stations for recording. The programs would then be
broadcast locally or delivered via land transport to the study centers and
branch schools.
24.       Nine UHF transmission stations would be established in the cities
where production capacity for broadcast quality programs is provided
(Annex 4e). Transmission equipment provided would include UHF transmitters,
antennae, transmission lines, frequency' and modulation monitoring equipment,
microwave links and spare parts. Operating powers would vary from 30 kW to 50
kW. The stations would be used exclusively for broadcast of TVU programs,
mainly to enrolled students, but they would have a potential audience of 5
million. They would each broadcast 70 hours per week, more than twice the
hours broadcast nal:ionally (para. 8).
25.       With the improved transmission capacity, enrollment in the TVU
system is expected to increase sharply (Annexes 4a and 4b), from the present
280OOO students to 1.3 million in 1990 and 2 million by the year 2000. The
present emphasis on upgrading employed workers is expected to diminish as
more recent middle-school graduates are accepted by the TVU (raising the
proportion of students from this source from the present 6% to about 30%),
thus increasing the output of qualified new workers. Introduction of a
mixed delivery system would allow the CRTVU to diversify its course
offerings without requiring an increase in the limited broadcast time
available. Moreover, the present gaps in enrollment in some years (para. 10)
would be eliminated.



- 9 -
26.       The introduction of new delivery systems (e.g., cassettes) would
enable the TVU system to extend its reach beyond urban centers. As a first
step, a pilot program of study groups would be set up in rural areas covered
by the PTVUs. The project would provide them with classrooms, video and
audio-cassettes and playback equipment, books and materials, and laboratory
equipment.
27.       Raising the Quality of Instruction.  Improvements in the quality
of instruction would be achieved by raising the TVU system-s capacity to
produce programs and teaching materials, as well as by improving the
technical and pedagogical quality of its programs; improvements in the
teaching environment at the 85 study centers; and, more generally, by a
program of technical assistance.
28.       The project would assist the CRTVU in constructing and equipping a
production center, comprising three studios, that could be used to produce
programs of a high technical quality and pedagogical content. The center
would be provided with studio equipment, as well as educational resource
materials, and could thus employ a wide range of techniques in program
production. These facilities and new techniques would allow the CRTVU to
increase its number of programs produced from 300 at present to 700, and
its number of courses from 50 at present to 170 by 1990. New courses would
include civil and architectural engineering, light industry, chemical
industry, management and accounting, political science and law (Annex 4c).
The CRTVU would also establish a laboratory center in Beijing, consisting of
12 laboratories (Annex 4g), which would be used: (a) to train key provin-
cial trainers in the use of laboratory equipment; (b) to set up demonstra-
tion experiments for video recording; and (c) to upgrade the level of CRTVU
and PTVU academic staff involved in the production of TVU courses. The
CRTVU's programs would be supplemented by written materials produced in an
in-house printing facility to eliminate delays that now occur in printing.
29.       Production centers at the PTVUs (9 major and 19 minor) would be
used to supplement the program output of the CRTVU in areas where local
centers would have a comparative advantage (e.g., in producing programs that
meet the specialized needs of local industry) or could produce programs of
acceptable quality at a lower cost. Exchange of programs between provinces
would be encouraged. The CRTVU would monitor programs needed by various
PTVUs and would assume responsibility for producing national programs when
these are required by several PTVUs.  New program production capacity at the
provincial level would be able to produce at least 3,250 programs - 1,350
(equivalent to 27 courses) at the nine major production centers, and 1,900
programs (38 courses) at the minor production centers.
30.       The project would improve the physical facilities of 85 study
centers (1-6 per province), each comprising laboratories, audiovisual
centers and classrooms. The total area available for instruction at these
centers at the end of the project would be about 300,000 sq m, with new



- 10 -
construction accounting for 73% of the total (Annex 4e). Laboratories would
be provided with equipment for teaching mechanics, electronics, civil and
architectural engineering, -Light and chemical industry, and language
courses. Other equipment would include audio and video cassette equipment
for replaying nonbroadcast programs, micro computers for teaching computer
"literacy" and basic programming, and audiovisual teaching aids. This
equipment should allow the PTVUs to improve the quality and increase the
percentage of experiments performed out of the total required by the
curriculum from 20-30% at present to over 80% by 1990. Also, a greater
proportion of students in technical fields would be able to perform more
experiments.
31.       A technical assistance program, including local training, foreign
fellowships and study tours, and specialist services, would strengthen the
professional qualifications of CRTVU-s technical and academic staff in such
areas as program design, operation and maintenance of production equipment,
management of learning resources, computers, and measurement, evaluation and
research design. Similarly, at the provincial level, staff would be trained
in program making, course design, and production techniques and procedures.
A local training program would be developed to assist staff in maintaining
audiovisual equipment (especially video cassette recorders) at the study
centers. Staff of the nine transmission stations would be trained to
operate and maintain the stations; since UHF transmission employs highly
advanced technology that is relatively new to China, training would most
likely be conducted at the manufacturer's facilities.
32.       Improved Management.  The project would improve management of the
TVU system through provision of computers and technical assistance. The
CRTVU would acquire a computer to establish files covering the whole TVU
system, with data on student enrollment and characteristics, program and
course production, examination results, and evaluation studies. Each PTVU
would acquire a computer to establish similar records. Computers would also
improve techniques and procedures for scheduling staff time and facilities,
including libraries, and management of education resources. Senior TVU
administrative staff (deans, directors, and registrars) would receive
training in modern management practices through seminars organized by the
CRTVU and conducted by experts.
Evaluation, Planning, and Preparation of Future Projects
33.       Evaluation.  Project evaluation would involve measuring, during
and at the end of the project, and for some years thereafter, progress (a)
in implementation of new higher education policies; and (b) towards meeting
project objectives using agreed project indicators (Annex 6). Each year,
project institutions would collect required basic data and conduct tracer
surveys of graduates to monitor the match between employment and fields of
study, which will allow MOE to determine the success of the new government
policy on student choice of employment. Local specialists would be employed
for much of this work, which requires a knowledge of Chinese and/or the



- 11 -
locality. Under the project, a unit for polytechnics has been established
within the MOE to assist in consolidating and analyzing collected data;
similarly, a research and evaluation unit for the TVU system has been
established within the CRTVU. The project would provide funds to be used
for local and foreign specialists (estimated at 590 and 150 man-months,
respectively), local and foreign fellowships (estimated at 1,770 and 580
man-months, respectively), and required equipment. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained from the Government that:  (a) tracer surveys as
described above would be conducted annually for polytechnics and period-
ically on a sampling basis for TVUs, and project progress monitored annually
until 1990; and (b) the planning and evaluation unit for polytechnics within
MOE, and the research and evaluation unit within the CRTVU would be main-
tained until 1990. An understanding was reached on the project indicators
and targets to be used in evaluation.
34.       Planning.  Because expansion of the polytechnic system is expected
to be rapid (para. 5), extensive planning is required at the central and
provincial levels. The polytechnic unit within MOE would be responsible for
overall development of the system. Smaller planning units have been or
are expected to be established at the provincial level and would conduct
studies in such areas as school location planning, and curriculum and staff
development. Similarly, the TVU research and evaluation unit would offer
advisory services to the PTVUs and would carry out studies aimed at
improving teaching methodology and providing the Government with statistical
data on costs and effectiveness. Moreover, the unit would be responsible
for planning additional study centers and delivery capability to expand TVU
coverage throughout the provinces by 1990. The project would provide funds
to be used for local and foreign specialists (estimated at 270 and 140
man-months, respectively), local and foreign fellowships (estimated at 2,270
and 530 man-months, respectively), and required equipment.
35.       Preparation of Future Projects.  China plans to tackle its
shortage of skilled manpower by doubling its enrollment in higher-level
education by 1990. Two important systems it will use to achieve such a
rapid expansion are the polytechnics and the TV University. It also plans
further quality improvements of education at the primary, secondary and
higher levels, and some quantitative expansion at its conventional colleges
and universities. To prepare for these as well as other investments in the
education sector, the project would provide funds for local and foreign
specialist services (estmated at 100 and 130 man-months, respectively), local
and foreign fellowships/study tours (estimated at 200 and 100 man-months,
respectively), and related equipment.
Project Management and Implementation
36.       Responsibility for project implementation would rest with MOE.  The
Vice Minister for Planning and Development would assume overall responsibility
for directing the project. He would be aided in this task by the Inter-
national Investment and Loan Office (IILO) established within MOE in 1982.



- 12 -
This office would. coordinate with and be supported by relevant sections of
MOE. Additional staff wouLd be appointed to IILO, one group to be responsible
for polytechnics, the other for the TVU system. IILO would also coordinate
project implementation with CRTVU administration and Provincial and Municipal
Bureaus of Higher Education; it would also draw on advisory services from
outside MOE, particularly from the China National Technical Import Corporation
(CNTIC) of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade. At the
institutional level, development plans have been prepared by senior management
committees, which report to the Provincial or Municipal Bureaus of Higher
Education. These local bureaus would report to IILO for all matters pertain-
ing to project implementation.  Staffing of IILO and relevant sections within
MOE would be adequate for implementing the project. A Polytechnic Commission,
including representatives from the 17 institutions, would be formed to assist
in project implementation. The Commission would be advised on equipment
procurement by a team selected from members of the Review Commission of the
University Development Project (Ln. 2021/Cr. 1167-CHA) (Annex 8b). During
negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that a Polytechnic
Commission would be established and maintained until the closing date.
Fellowship candidates nominated by project institutions would be submitted to
local Bureaus of Higher Education and to MOE for approval. Technical
assistance for installation and maintenance of major pieces of equipment would
be included in equipment procurement contracts. Terms of reference for other
specialists would be submitted for Association review before contracts are
signed. Specialists would be selected in accordance with the "Guidelines for
the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (August 1981).
Status of Project Preparation
37.       The project is at an advanced stage of preparation.  Land has been
acquired and designs prepared for all project institutions; civil works for
some institutions have already begun. A mission of procurement specialists,
financed out of Ln. 2021/ Cr. 1167-CHA, has assisted the Government in
refining building designs and equipment lists. Bid documents for all
equipment in the first phase of procurement have been substantially completed.
Project Cost and Financing (Annex 7a and b)
38.       The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at RMB 412.5
million or $206.2 million equivalent including contingencies. Project costs
include: (a) construction and renovation of physical facilities; (b) locally
procured and imported equipment and furniture; and (c) technical assistance.
Association financing under the proposed credit would amount to $85.0 million
(41% of total project costs) and cover all foreign exchange costs. The
remaining $121.2 million would be financed by the Government.  Cost estimates
for civil works, goods, and services are based on May 1983 prices. Construc-
tion costs were estimated on the basis of recently started construction,
analysis of unit prices of comparable buildings, and existing sketch plans.
Furniture and equipment costs were based on master lists prepared by project



- 13 -
institutions, and reviewed by Bureaus of Higher Education, MOE, consultants,
and Association staff. Technical assistance costs for foreign experts
(including salaries, allowances, housing costs, and airfares) were estimated
at $7,500 per man-month, and costs for overseas fellowship training were
estimated at $1,250 per man-month. The contingency allowance of $40.6 million
includes: (a) physical contingencies ($8.2 million) estimated at 5% of base
costs; and (b) price contingencies ($32.4 million), allowing for an estimated
local and foreign price escalation of 5.5% per annum for the balance of 1983,
7.5% in 1984, 7% in 1985, and 6% in 1986-88. Project-financed goods are
exempt from import duties and taxes. Recurrent costs generated by the project
are estimated at about $16 million equivalent per annum at May 1983 prices,
and would be insignificant compared to the budgets of MOE and the provincial
and municipal bureaus of education.
Procurement
39.       Civil Works.  Under this project, provincial and municipal
governments would finance and supervise all civil works and follow local
procedures for selection of construction bureaus, award of contracts, and
settlement of bills. These procedures are being followed in the University
Development and Agricultural Education and Research Projects and are
satisfactory. Buildings are suitably designed for education needs and the
Association would supervise construction.
40.       Equipment.  Equipment would be procured in accordance with
acceptable lists prepared by project institutions, reviewed by the Polytechnic
Commission (para. 36), consolidated and approved by MOE, and approved by the
Association. Equipment would be procured in two phases over about two years.
Bid documents and specifications for ICB would be prepared by the Commission,
the advisory team and IILO (para. 36) of the MOE. Invitations to bid are
expected to be issued in the first semester of FY84. MOE would carry overall
responsibility for procurement and administration, and would continue to
receive assistance from CNTIC in handling bid invitation, bid evaluation, and
contract award.
41.       Of the total project cost of $206.2 million equivalent, equipment
is estimated to account for $124.0 million (with a base cost of about
$98 million). Equipment lists have been divided into 2 categories in
accordance with expected sources of supply. One list, 45% of the total,
contains basic and standard laboratory equipment, laboratory materials and
books in Chinese. These are available from local suppliers and quality is
reasonable. Such items will be financed by the Covernment and procured in
China in accordance with local procedures, which are satisfactory. The
Association is satisfied that such procedures are economic and efficient,
because (a) the prices of the items on this list manufactured in China are
generally lower than those in the international market, and (b) it takes less
time to obtain these miscellaneous items from the local market than through
international competitive bidding (ICB). The second list, 55% of



- 14 -
the total, contains equipment that is unlikely to be manufactured by local
industries. The bulk of this equipment would be procured through ICB and
financed by the Association. Items on this list would be grouped into
packages to the extent possible for bulk procurement. Each invitation to
bid exceeding an estimated cost of $200,000 would be subject to ICB. Local
manufacturers would be permitted to participate and would be extended a 15%
preference margin, or the prevailing customs duties, whichever is lower, in
the evaluation of bids. Items or groups of items estimated to cost less
than $200,000 in each contract and not exceeding an aggregate amount of $6.0
million may be procured through: (a) limited international tendering,
whereby contracts would be awarded on the basis of comparison and evaluation
of quotations obtained from at least 3 suppliers; or (b) direct purchase for
proprietary items or where justified by the need for standardization. Books
in foreign languages and audiovisual instructional materials would be pro-
cured directly from publishers/producers or distributors. Prior Association
review of contractL awards would exclude small contracts ($200,000 or less)
estimated to cover less than 25% of the value of all contracts. Post review
of such contracts would be performed by review missions on a sample basis.
Disbursement (Annex 7d)
42.       The proposed credit of $85.0 million equivalent would be disbursed
on the basis of: (a) 100% of the foreign expenditures of imported equipment
or the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment; (b) 75% of the
invoiced cost of imported equipment procured locally; (c) 100% of the
expenditures for specialist services and study tours; (d) 100% of expend-
itures for overseas fellowships; and (e) 100% of foreign expenditures for
books and instructional materials.
43.       Under tihe project, a special account would be set up for disburse-
ments for the overseas fellowship program. The special account would allow
smooth implementation of the program, involving over 700 fellows, by
facilitating advance payments to students. The special account would be set
up and maintained in US dollars in the Bank of China in New York. The
initial deposit of the US dollar equivalent of SDR 800,000 represents the
highest estimated expenditure for any three months of the program.
Applications for replenishment would be submitted quarterly. Opening of the
special account would be a condition of effectiveness.
44.        The completion date would be December 31, 1988 and the closing
date December 31, 1989. The proposed project would be implemented over a
five-year period at a faster pace than the regional average for education
projects. This is feasible because some project items are at an advanced
stage of preparation.
45.       Accounts and Audit.  During negotiations, assurances were
obtained from the Government that: project accounts would be maintained



- 15 -
according to accounting principles and practices satisfactory to the
Association; annual audits of project expenditures would be carried out by
independent auditors acceptable to the Association; and it would provide the
Association with audited financial statements within six months after the
close of each Chinese fiscal year.
Benefits and Risks
46.       Benefits.  There would be five principal benefits from the pro-
posed project:  (a) policy changes implemented for the polytechnics would
have long-term effects on the higher education and employment systems in
China; (b) the output of skilled technicians would increase; (c) the quality
of graduates would improve; (d) the management of both the polytechnics and
the TVU system would improve; and (e) access to higher education would be
expanded. The shortage of graduates and skilled technicians constitutes a
severe constraint on China's economic development. As a result of the
proposed project, the Government expects polytechnic enrollment to increase
to about 45,000 students. TVU enrollment would more than triple to 1.3
million in 1990, with a corresponding increase in output (425,000 graduates).
By the end of the project, 30% of enrollment in the TVU would comprise
recent middle-school graduates, who would become net additions to the
skilled labor force. "Hands on experience in using modern equipment and
computers would provide better qualified graduates.
47.       Risks.  A major uncertainty for this project concerns the newness
of the polytechnic institutions and policy changes for the Chinese education
system. Particular attention would therefore be paid to ensure that adequate
evaluation and planning for the future development and extension of the
polytechnic system is carried out. These functions would be assumed by
polytechnic units established or expected to be established at the national
and provincial levels and strengthened through technical assistance provided
under the project. Moreover, targets (project indicators) have been
established and would be used to identify potential problem areas. A second
risk concerns the installation and the operation and maintenance of project
equipment. Some of the equipment, especially for the TVU transmission
stations, is very sophisticated. An extensive program of technical assis-
tance has therefore been developed to train staff who would use and maintain
the new equipment.
AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
48.       Understanding was reached between the Government and the
Association on means to measure progress towards meeting project objectives,
including specific targets for expansion of enrollment and teaching
programs, and improvement of management and teaching quality (para. 33).



- 16 -
49.       Assurances were obtained from the Government that:
(a) the project would be monitored and evaluated annually on the basis
of tracer surveys and project indicators as agreed upon between
the Govesrnment and the Association (para. 33);
(b) a planning and evaluation unit for polytechnics within MOE and a
research and evaluation unit in the CRTVU would be maintained
until 1990 (para. 33);
(c)  a Polytechnic Commission would be established and maintained
during the life of the project (para. 36); and
(d) the Government would submit for Association review audited
financial statements within six months after the end of each
Chinese fiscal year (para. 45).
50.       Conditions of effectiveness are that:  (a) China's State Council
would approve the Development Credit Agreement; and (b) the Borrower would
set up a special account tc, facilitate implementation of the overseas
fellowship program (para. 43).
51.       Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project would con-
stitute a suitable basis for a credit of SDR 79.6 million ($85.0 million
equivalent) on standard IDA terms.

Comparative Education Data are useful in the evaluartin of various education systems and analysis of relative stsgea of educational develop-eot between various
countries. However, on the basis of the pr-esent data, cross-national comparison should be approached with great caution. Data presented in the above table have
been collected largely by Bank missions from government sources; the remainder are staff estimates or data from Unesco.  Efforts have been made to standardize
definitiona and, within limits, to check the accuracy of the data.  Nevertheless, such data are still imperfect in several respects and the Bank is working to
improve them progressively on the occasion of its operational work. In the use of these data, the following qualifications should be kept in mind:
(1) 'Education as defined in the table includes all education and training, both formaal and non-formal.
(2) 'Primary" education refers to education at the first level and 'secondary' education refers to all education at the secondary level regardless of type
(e.g., general, technical, sgricultural).
(3) "Literacy rates- (col. 6) are often obtained fron country censuses. In many countries they are only approximations and it is doubtful that any uniform
definition of 'literate' has bero followed consistently.
(4) "Public empenditure in education' (cols. 4 and 5) refers to all capital and recurrent expenditures devoted to education by public and qoasi-public
agencies.
(5) "Enrollment ratios" (cola. 7, 12 and 14) refer to school year and are the percentage of eligible children enrolled full-time in the appropriate school,
public and private by level. They are often subject to a wide mtargin of error in the developing coontries owing to variations in the accuracy of basic
data (i.e., age-specific populatIon and enrol-menrt). E-rolLnent figures frequently are higher than the number of students actually in school. Over-aged
students whose incluaion is indicated by footnotes also can inflate the ratios.

POLYTECHNIC/TELEVISION UNIVERSITY PROJECT
Government Policies in Higher Educatiorn
1.        Background.  Access to higher education in China is limited.  The
enrollment ratio in formal higher education was 2.1% in 1981, compared with
4 to 5% in other developing countries, and out of about 7 million senior
secondary school students graduating in China every year, only 4-5% are
admitted. Some of the constraints on expanding the system are:
(a) a generous student boarding policy providing dormitories for a
majority of students regardless of their residence. This policy
has prevented institutions from increasing enrollment because
of a shortage of dormitory places. It also increases unit cost
(recurrent and capital) in higher education, which amounted to
$1,150 in 1979, compared to an average of $534 in other
developing countries. Dormitory costs in China are about 40% of
total recurrent costs.
(b) free tuition and scholarships for students. In conventional
universities, students do not pay fees. 85% of them also
receive scholarships equivalent to the salary of an unskilled
worker. Higher education is thus costly to the Government which
lacks the resources to expand it substantially.
(c) guaranteed Government job assignment for all graduates. An
increase in enrollment needs to be matched by increased capacity
of the personnel bureaus to assign jobs to graduates. A gap
currently exists and a number of graduates are unemployed for a
period before receiving job assignments.
2.        To eliminate these constraints, the Government has adopted three new
policies, which would be implemented in the 17 polytechnics:
3.        Non-residential Institutions.  The polytechnics would accept day
students who live within the municipality. Without this new policy, the
construction of dormitories and their operation and maintenance would have
cost about $28 million and would increase project costs from $46 million to
$74 million. The elimination of dormitories means about 35% reduction in
both capital and recurrent costs of polytechnic facilities.

4.        On the other hand, the absence of dormitories could have adverse
effects on students in terms of transportation costs, commuting time and
poor study conditions at home. It could also lead to an all urban student
body as only those who live within commuting distance can attend. The
Government wouLd consider building dormitories for some non-urban students
in future phases of polytechnic development. Some municipalities would also
explore ways to facilitate student commuting such as assigning special buses
for polytechnic students.
5.        Student Tuition.  Polytechnic students would be charged a fee of
Y 50 ($25), wh-ich is about 8% of the 1981 GNP per capita of $300. This fee
would lighten the financial burden to local governments, the major source of
funds for polytechnics. The Government would monitor effects of this policy
on student demand in polytechnic education and would consider introducing
fees in convenitional universities as' well.
6.        Student Choice of Employment.  Graduates of polytechnics would not
be assigned to jobs like graduates of conventional universities. They
would receive placement assistance from the institutions through their
contacts with local enterprises. The purpose is to give students incentive
to study harder because only students who are up to standard would find
jobs. This is aimed at correcting a flaw within the conventional university
system where students are guaranteed jobs, regardless of performance.
However, this policy would have wider implications, such as the introduction
of market forces which would direct students to major in skills needed in
local industries. Most graduates of polytechnics would be employed by
enterprises in their places of residence, in contrast to graduates of
conventional universities who are assigned jobs anywhere in the country.
Meager experience to date indicates that many students appreciate this new
policy. The Government would monitor the impact of these factors.

POLYTECHNIC/TELEVISION UNIVERSITY PROJECT
Curriculum Development
1.        Polytechnics are new postsecondary institutions that have been
coverted from existing technical institutions. These technical institutions
offered narrow specializations and lacked well-trained teaching and adminis-
trative staff, facilities and equipment necessary for offering a broad
program. The polytechnics are designed to correct these problems but much
work needs to be done to develop a polytechnic curriculum that emphasizes
practical work. Present curriculum used at the polytechnics mirrors that
used at regular universities, which is highly specialized and
theory-oriented.
2.        Project polytechnics would offer a broad range of specializations
in engineering, science, business management, economics, social sciences and
humanities (Attachment 1). The range of specializations would increase with
the introduction of new courses relevant to the major regional industries
(Annex 3b). Each field of study would include a wide range of offerings
that fall into three categories: (i) general knowledge courses required of
all students in all fields of study, such as Political Economy and
Philosophy; (ii) basic courses required of students in related fields, such
as Mathematics and Computer Language; and (iii) specialized courses in a
field of study.
3.        Polytechnics would establish advisory committees representing
industries, universities and provincial bureaus of planning and higher
education to develop curricula and hire staff with adequate industrial
experience to teach specialized courses.
4.        To help develop curricula, the project would finance:
(a)  specialist services (local and foreign) to conduct a series of
seminars for various fields of study. The seminars would focus on
curriculum development, content of teaching programs, the use of
advanced equipment and instructional materials, relevance of
training to industrial needs and feasibility of introducing modern
industrial techniques and management practices to the industrial
and commercial sectors. The seminars would be organized for
groups of polytechnics that offer similar fields of study.
Selected staff from the polytechnics would attend the seminar and
subsequently train other staff at their institutions. This
procedure would facilitate exchange of information and promote
coordination among polytechnics while at the same time allowing
each institution to maintain unique features in its curricula;

(b)  short-term study tours to update the knowledge of polytechnic
staff on modern training methods; and
(c) fellowships in subject matter areas to upgrade the level of
selected staff who would play a significant role in curriculum
development.

Note:  The disbursemenit schedule is expected to be faster than the regional
average because most of the equipment, which forms the bulk of Associa-
tion financing, will be procured in the first three years of the project.
The implementation rate of the first China education project (University
Development Project - Loan 2021/Credit 1167-C1A) shows that such a sched-
ule is realist-ic.
