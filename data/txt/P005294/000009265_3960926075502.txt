MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMNT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE HASHE3JE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
FOR A NATIONAL URBAN DEVELOPMT PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan to the Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan of US $26.4 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed
loan would carry a standard variable interest rate with a maturity of 17 years
including 4 years of grace and would help finance an urban development project.
2.       Background.  Jordan is a highly urbanized country.  Following three
decades of high population growth and massive immigration, about 70 percent of
its 2.8 million inhabitants live in cities and towns. The urban population is
growing at an annual rate of about 5 percent. Fueled by remittances, housing
investments since 1975 have averaged 25 percent of gross capital formation and
9 percent of GDP-an exceptionally high figure for a country at Jordan's
income level (US$1,560 per capita GNP in 1985). Much of the urban housing,
however, has taken the form of sprawling, scattered developments on large
plots, which has brought with it excessive infrastructure costs and a shortage
of housing affordable to low-income groups. The poor have had little choice
but to live in overcrowded conditions in rental apartments or in informal
housing areas with few service amenities; they incur increased health risks
because of the overcrowding, lack of appropriate health care, and inadequate
sanitation. The first Bank-financed Urban Development Project (UDPl, Loan No.
1893-JO, US$21 million, 1980) signaled a significant departure from past
policy; it developed 2,800 small residential plots and upgraded four slum
areas accommodating about 1,400 families. The success of this project in
addressing the housing needs of the poor in a cost-effective manner without
Government subsidies led to a second project (UDP2) in the Amman area (Loan
No.2587-JO, US$28 million, 1985). Reflecting its aim to achieve more balanced
regional development and responding to the shelter needs of the poor outside
the capital area, the Government gave the Urban Development Department
(UDD)--which had been responsible for implementing the first two projects-a
nationwide mandate in 1986.
3.       Project Objectives.  The proposed National Urban Development Project
would support the Government's recent urban development policy initiatives by
building upon and extending to all of Jordan the successful experience gained
under the two previous World Bank-funded urban projects in Amman. Its
objectives are to improve living conditions in the largest remaining squatter
and slum areas in the country, manage urban growth through rapid and
cost-effective development of infrastructure and social facilities, and
recover the full cost of infrastructure through lana sales and tariffs. The



-2-
project would encourage the private sector to make a greater contribution to
the construction of housing for low-income groups by making serviced and
appropriatelv subdivided land and financing available to individuals and
developers. The project also aims to strengthen the UDD and the two main
financial ;nstitutions in the urban sector--the Housing Bank (HB) and the
Cities and Villages Development Bank (CVDB)-to enable them to deal more
effectively with low-income shelter development throughout Jordan.
4.       Project Description.  The proposed project would finance:
(a) upgrading of low-income squatter and slum areas with a total population of
about 40,000 through regularization of land tenure and provision of water and
sewerage, paved streets and footpaths, and improved drainage; (b) land
development through provision of on-site and, when required, off-site
infrastructure for about 14,000 people (of whom about three quarters would
have incomes below the 40th percentile) and for small workshops and trade
establishments; (c) construction of core houses on up to 40 percent of new
plots to help stimulate rapid development of the sites and allow for immediate
occupancy; (d) provision of housing and construction loans to the
beneficiaries on both the sites to be developed and upgraded; (e)
establishment of social facilities, namely schools, clinics* emergency centers
(including fire fighting vehicles and ambulances), community buildings, and
women's training centers in upgrading and land development areas; and (f)
institutional development by furnishing advisory services, logistical support,
and training for UDD and HB.
5.       The project sites would be spread throughout Jordan.  Because of the
large number of subprojects and the growing capability of the implementing
agencies, a line-of-credit approach would be adopted for the proposed
project. The UDD would plan, design and implement the land development and
upgrading schemes in cooperation with local authorities; the HB would appraise
the subprojects, provide construction finance to UDD and mortgage and
construction loans to individual households; and the CVDB would appraise and
channel the Government funds for the required social facilities and when
necessary provide construction finance. The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$93.3 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
US$26.4 million (28 percent). A breakdown of the costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursements, as well as the Disbursement Schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Jordan are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.  A map is
also attached.  The Staff Appraisal Report (Number 6739-JO) dated May 15, 1987
is being distributed separately.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Since the late 1970s, the World
Bank--through lending, sector work, and support for studies carried out by the
Government and its consultants-has been closely associated with important
urban policy initiatives in Jordan and has helped establish two key
organizations in the sector (UDD and CVDB). The proposed project would
continue and deepen the World Bank's support for institution building and
urban policy reform. It would extend the use of improved planning and design
standards--previously introduced and proven successful in the Greater Amman
area under the first two Bank-financed urban development projects-to smaller
towns and cities throughout the country. In parallel, the project would
further strengthen the main agencies--UDD, HB, and CVDB-and establish close
working relationships among them and with the municipalities. The project
would also help structure the financial flows for land development (commercial



-3-
construction finance) and house construction (individual mortgage loans) in
such a way as to increase the access of low-income families to decent housing
and set the stage for a greater involvement by privete real estate developers
in low-cost shelter construction.
7.       Agreed Actions.  Agreement was secured at negotiations that:  (a)
UDD, HB, and CVDB would apply agreed criteria, standards, and procedures for
preparing, appraising, and implementing subprojects; and (b) UDD and HB would
be properly staffed and employ consultants with qualifications, experience,
and terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank. Conditions of effectiveness
would be that: (i) a full-time appraisal advisor for HB and key staff in HB
au.d UDD have been appointed; (ii) a management and credit agreement between
the Government and CVDB has been executed; and (iii) a subsidiary financing
agreement between the Government and HEB has been executed.
8.       Justification.  The project is designed to address the urgent need in
Jordan for shelter and related infrastructure as well as a full range of
social services at prices affordable to low-income families, while employing
appropriate cost recovery provisions. Such an approach is essential in a
period of increasing budgetary constraints in Jordan. Overall about 60,000
individuals, half of whom have incomes below the Bank-defined urban proverty
threshold, would benefit from the project. In particular, by providing paved
roads, community areas, adequate drainage, piped water and sewerage systems
and allowing access for solid waste collection, the project would dramatically
improve the physical environment and quality of life for some 8,000 families
living in squatter and slum areas throughout the country. The project would
also encourage private savings and help channel them into house construction
and improvements for low-income families.
9.       For most of the potential sites and services and upgrading areas,
final site selection has not been made and hence, costs and benefits cannot
yet be estimated. However, among the criteria for determining the eligibility
of subprojects for financing under the line of credit would be an acceptable
economic rate of return, i.e., a return of at least 9 percent, equal to the
opportunity cost of capital. Based on detailed estimates carried out for UDP1
and UDP2, it can be expected that the rates of return would range between 15
and 30 percent for upgraded areas and 12 to 20 percent for new sites.
Sufficient data are available for the Aqaba subprojects to calculate an
economic rate of return which is estimated to be about 15 percent if the costs
of community facilities--for which benefits can not be quantified-are
excluded. If these facilities are included on the cost side, the rate of
return falls to about 13 percent. The expected average for all subprojects is
16 percent.
10.      Risks.  The three key agencies responsible for project implementation
have proven track records. The demand for small plots developed and sold
under UDP1 was high, and community support for previous upgrading work has
been strong. Nonetheless, the expansion of UDD's upgrading and land
development activities to smaller towns and cities introduces some uncertainty
about market demand and community acceptance. The UDD is countering these
risks through phasing of construction and adopting flexible designs for the
new sites which will help it to adjust to changing market conditions. It is
also putting increased emphasis on early involvement by its community
development staff in explaining the upgrading program and modifying plans and
designs in response to local needs and aspirations. The UDD would also
require that, before work starts on an upgrading scheme, a majority of the



-4-
households should have demonstrated their commitment to the scheme by having
made cash deposits to UDD, opened savings accounts with HB, consented in
writing or indicated their intention to pay for the works through some other
comperable action. The potential problems associated with the expanded
operations of the concerned organizations and the complex interactions between
them have been minimized through training in managerial as well as technical
skills and appropriate coordination mechanisms. Given the successful track
records of the three principal institutions involved in the project, the
overall risk is small.
11.      Recormendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
