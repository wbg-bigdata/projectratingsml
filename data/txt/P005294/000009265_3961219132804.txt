IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
NATIONAL URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2841-30)
Preface
1.    This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the National Urban Development
Project in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, for which Loan 2841-JO, in the amount of US$26.4
million was approved on June 16, 1987.
2.    The Loan was closed on June 15, 1995, compared with an expected closing date of June 30,
1993 in the appraisal report. Final disbursement from the loan took place on September 29, 1995. A
balance of US$3,166,394 was cancelled on November 29, 1995.
3.    The ICR was prepared by Faye Lumsden, Task Manager, Suhail Jme'an, Gerald Erbach and
Deepali Tewari, Consultants, Private Sector Development and Infrastructure Division of the Middle
East and North Africa Region and reviewed by Alastair J. McKechnie, Division Chief, and Tufan
Kolan, Acting Projects Advisor.
4.    The beneficiary agencies were the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDC),
also the implementing agency, and the Housing Bank (HB). HUDC and HB contributed on behalf of
the Borrower, the Government of Jordan, to the preparation of the ICR by presenting its viewpoints
on different matters and events, preparing their own project operation plans (enclosed as Appendix
B), and conmmenting on the draft ICR.
5.    Preparation of this ICR began during a supervision/completion mission in January 1995. The
ICR is based on material in the project files and on information provided by HUDC and HB.

NATIONAL URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 284140)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.    The Project (UDP3) is the third urban development project in Jordan to be supported by
IBRD financing. The Project was appraised and presented to the Board of the World Bank in 1987
and reflected increased emphasis on formal private sector provision of housing. A major transition
from earlier UDP1 and UDP2 whose focus was on improving public sector programs to meet basic
shelter needs of low and moderate income households.
Project Objectives
2.    The project objectives were:
(i)   to improve living conditions in the largest remaining high density squatter and slum
areas (other than the refugee camps);
(ii)   to manage urban growth through rapid and cost effective development of appropriate
levels of service;
(iii)  to encourage deeper private sector participation in the provision of low-income
housing; and
(iv)   to strengthen capacity of local institutions to finance low-income housing.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.    Physical implementation of the Project succeeded in providing infrastructure for some 13,600
residents in four previously unserved areas and approximately 43,000 residents of nine new sites. A
complement of community facilities (mainly schools, health and community centers) were also
provided.
4.    A series of unforeseen extraneous events and government actions resulted in delaying project
implementation. The Project was to have been implemented in six years but reached a total of almost
eight years before the Loan was closed in June 1995. HUDC estimates that it will take four more
years for residents to fully build their houses and to complete all aspects of the Project.
5.    Some of these events included the Government's decision to combine the former Housing
Corporation with the former Urban Development Department into a new agency, HUDC. The Gulf
Crisis (1990/91) and the ensuing precipitous decline of the local economy along with shortages of
building materials added to the implementation delays.



iv                                                                    Evaluation Summary
6.    Bank and Borrower performances were satisfactory. Overall, the Project had a satisfactory
outcome and the achievements related to the principal objectives have essentially taken hold and are
likely to be sustained. Briefly stated, Project elements and activities which worked well included:
the physical results of the upgrading and sites and services components; the continued excellence in
establishing community relations activities; the close cooperation of all stakeholders. Elements that
could have been done better included: the continued reliance on hidden subsidies to improve the
affordability of programs; the limited dialogue with private sector developers; and, the lack of a clean
definition of housing delivery responsibilities within a moderate policy framework.
7.    A key lesson leamed is that deeper and more fundamental changes in the housing delivery
system are required to ensure replicability and economic efficiency of providing formal private sector
housing for lower income groups. Such efforts must necessarily have the full commnitment and
support of the Govermnent at both national and local levels.
8.    Private sector involvement in housing delivery increases the number of the stakeholders and
decision makers involved in the process. As a result, the "enabling environment" within which these
stakeholders are required to work becomes increasingly important. The UDP3 Project has helped the
Government to cross a major threshold in favor of establishing an enabling approach and to accept
less direct control over the ultimate housing outcomes. Housing production under such an enabling
approach is generally more incremental and time consuming than direct public sector intervention.
9.    The Project also showed the need for a local "champion" or leader in the housing sector that
can perceive the gaps and bottlenecks in housing delivery system and recommnend practical measures
that will lead to their resolution. Recognizing the role of the public sector as that of "enabler" and
not as a privileged competitor to the private sector will require a major change in thinking and modes
of operation by many of the decision makers and agencies currently involved in the housing sector.
10.   Both the Bank and the Government have learned that they will need to make fundamental
changes in their thinking and approach to the delivery of housing for low and middle income
households. The follow-up Housing Finance and Urban Sector Reforms Project, based on studies
conducted as part of UDP3, will substantially contribute to this process.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
NATIONAL URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2841-JO)
PART I
Project Implementation Assessment
1.    Introduction
1.1   The Project (UDP3) is the third urban development or "UDP" project in Jordan to be
supported by IDA/IBRD financing. The Project, which was appraised and presented to the Board of
the World Bank in 1987, reflected an increased emphasis on formal private sector provision of
housing and a major transition from the earlier UDP1 and UDP2 focus on improving public sector
programs to meet the basic shelter needs of low and moderate income households.
1.2   The project was a concrete manifestation of Government intentions to increase the formal
private sector role in providing shelter for low and moderate income households. It included six
components:
(i)    upgrading of low income squatter and slum areas through the regularization of tenure
and the provision of basic infrastructure for a total estimated population of 40,000
people;
(ii)   land development through the provision of on and off-site infrastructure as required
for approximately 15,000 people;
(iii)  construction of core houses on no more than 40 percent of the new plots;
(iv)   mortgage loans from the Housing Bank for the acquisition of plots and core houses;
(v)   social facilities in upgrading and land development areas; and
(vi)  institutional development through advisory services, training and logistical support for
the former Urban Development Department (UDD) and the Housing Bank (HB).
1.3   Previous World Bank financed projects in the urban sector included: the UDP1 and UDP2
projects for low income housing and upgrading; two Cities and Villages Development Bank Projects
for municipal finance; the Amman Transport and Municipal Development Project for urban transport;
and several public utility projects in urban areas. The UDP1 and UDP2 projects were successful in
developing new housing, but did not produce the desired level of formal private sector participation.
Sustainability of the two municipal finance projects has been jeopardized by structural weaknesses
(city size, revenue bases etc.) in the secondary cities which have been targeted.

2.     Project Objectives
2.1    The project objectives were:
(i)   to improve living conditions in the largest remaining high density squatter and slum
areas in Jordan (other than the refugee camps);
(ii)   to manage urban growth through rapid and cost-effective development of basic
engineering infrastructure and social facilities;
(iii)  to recover the cost of upgrading and expansion of infrastructure facilities from the
residents through land sales and tariffs;
(iv)   to encourage the private sector to make a greater contribution to the construction of
housing for low-income groups; and,
(v)   to strengthen the capacity of local institutions to undertake and finance low income
housing and urbanization projects.
A major assumption of the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) was that the achievement of these project
objectives would pave the way for a more substantial private sector role in the provision of housing
for low and moderate income families.
2.2    No modifications were made to the original project objectives even though the Project was
appraised and implemented during a period of major macro-economic, political and policy transition.
During this period, the economy was restructured, systems for the democratic election of officials
were introduced and major shelter sector policy and institutional changes were put into effect. The
Gulf Crisis and its aftermath also caused a major interruption of the Project. In light of these
conditions, the closing date for the Project was twice extended so that the necessary project works
could be carried out. The project disbursement rate was increased in order to benefit from the change
in value of the Jordanian dinar and to counter the negative effects of the Gulf Crisis on the Jordanian
economy beginning in 1991. The Loan Agreement was modified to permit the financing of studies
related to the transformation of the housing sector. Project work was still taking place at the time
that the Loan was closed on June 15, 1995.
2.3    Much project effort and a great deal of its success concerned the achievement of physical and
institutional improvements.
3.     Achievement of Objectives
Improved Living Conditions in the Largest Remaining High Density Squatter and Slum Areas
3.1    The Project succeeded in providing infrastructure to four important upgrading sites in the
Aqaba region (Salahaddin, Shallalah, Old Town South and Old Town North). These four projects
covered a combined area of 47.7 hectares and served a total population of around 13,600 people
living on some 1,953 residential plots. The infrastructure and services provided to these areas
included water supply, electricity, sewerage, roads and telephones. The total amount spent on this
component of the project up until the end of 1994 was JD4.2 million (or US$ 6.4 million). Housing



Inzplementation Completion Report                                                     3
loans were obtained by some 18 percent of the 1,080 resident households for a total of JD4.1 million
(US$ 6.1 million).
Management of Urban Growth Through Rapid and Cost-Effective Development of Infrastructure and
Social Facilities
3.2    The Project also provided infrastructure and services to nine sites and services projects
covering a total of 165.5 hectares and serving an estimated population of 32,000 people living on
4762 new plots. The total cost of this element of the UDP3 project up until the end of 1994 was
JD21.3 million (US$ 31.8 million). The basic infrastructure provided included roads, water supply,
sewerage, electricity and telephones. Community facilities provided through the Project included
schools, community centers and health centers.
Cost Recovery for Upgrading and Expansion of Infrastructure Facilities
3.3    The costs of land, infrastructure and community improvements directly benefitting the
residents of upgraded areas and the recipients of newly developed plots were to be recovered through
property sales and user charges. The costs of project elements benefitting the wider community were
to be recovered through taxes.
3.4    Roughly 85 percent or 761 plots out of a total of 896 plots in the two upgrading areas being
managed by the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDC) have been sold. The two Old
Town sites have been taken over by the Aqaba Regional Authority. About 29 percent or 1,325 plots
out a total of 4,762 plots in the new sites have also been sold. As of July 1995, the total amount of
funds recovered from the sale of all plots has been roughly JD6.9 million (US$ 10.3 million).
Private Sector Construction of Housing for Low-Income Groups
3.5    The Government, with World Bank support, undertook several project related initiatives to
encourage the formal private sector to produce housing for low and moderate income households. To
start, the Government assigned responsibility for project appraisal to the local financing agency, the
Jordan Housing Bank, from which private developers could obtain construction financing and then
have these funds rolled over into mortgage loans as a matter of standard practice. It was believed that
this would increase housing demand and reduce some of the developers' risk in marketing their units.
3.6   In order to further integrate regular procedures into the process, the local financing agency
was required to bear that part of the repayment risk which was not covered by the Low Income
Housing Revolving Fund (LIHRF). Arrears as of February 1996 amounted to only 1.3 percent of the
outstanding balance of the loans made under the program and concerned only 0.014 percent of the
borrowers.
3.7   The Governmnent also agreed to sell at least 35 percent of the land within new UDP3 sites at
market prices to both individuals and private developers who could then further subdivide and develop
these areas for low and moderate income households. All of the development to be carried out was
based on the principal of affordable standards.
3.8   Private sector developers of low income housing were also to be extended the same privileges
and incentives that were previously offered only to public sector agencies. It was assumed that the



4                                                         Implementation Completion Report
removal of inequities between public and private sector developers would help reduce unfair
competition and promote project replicability. The fact that public sector developers previously
enjoyed a number of cost and institutional advantages over the private sector was a frequently stated
reason why private sector developers were not able to compete with public sector agencies in the low
income housing market.
Strengthened Capacity of Local Institutions to Undertake and Finance Low Income Housing and
Urbanization Projects.
3.9    The merger of the former Urban Development Department (UDD) and the Housing
Corporation (HC) into the new Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDC) occurred
during project implementation and led to substantial changes in the delivery of housing for low and
moderate income households and in the institutional aspects of the Project.
3.10   As a result, training and institution building efforts within the project covered both pre- and
post-merger needs and activities.
3.11   Pre-merger technical assistance, equipment and training was aimed at helping the UDD and
the Housing Bank develop their respective capabilities in identifying, preparing, designing and
appraising projects and in operating and managing construction financing and a portfolio of small
loans. Institutional development for the UDD centered on management functions, including
coordination and scheduling, and not on engineering design, which was the previous focus of UDP1
and UDP2 technical assistance. Assistance to the Housing Bank helped the Bank to establish an in-
house capacity to appraise and monitor low income housing projects and to facilitate their
implementation through the private sector.
3.12   Post-merger assistance included the engagement of experienced, international consultants to
help HUDC develop a viable strategy for its future and to establish a Business Plan. The resulting
conclusion of this effort was that the Government, working through the former UDD within HUDC,
should significantly reduce its land and housing development activity over the next few years.
Maintaining HUDC's upgrading capabilities was considered to be necessary in order to contribute to
the eventual improvement of the Palestinian refugee camps once the political issue of their future has
been resolved. As a result of this study, HUDC reorganized itself into a land development section
that would eventually be privatized and a policy and training section that would continue to monitor
the housing sector and to provide policy guidance to the Government.
3.13   HUDC conmmissioned a follow up study to develop options for the disposition of assets and
functions that would be better implemented and/or managed by the private sector (e.g., land, land
development, a portfolio of mortgages). The key elements of this study will be implemented as part
of the follow-on Housing Finance and Urban Sector Reform Project (HFUSR).
4.    Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
4.1    Physical implementation of the project succeeded in providing infrastructure for some 13,600
residents in four underserved areas and approximately 43,000 residents of nine new sites.
Conmnunity facilities (mainly primary schools, health centers and community centers) were provided
or improved for 12 out of the 13 sites.



Implementation Completion Report                                                      5
4.2   Several actions and events had an important effect on UDP3 project implementation. Among
others, these included:
the decision by the Government to combine the former Housing Corporation (HC)
with the former Urban Development Department (UDD) in a new agency entitled the
Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDC). The changeover caused a
number of delays and resulted in a new agency with a narrower mandate and a
portfolio of less comprehensive projects. The new HUDC also required some time to
adjust to the merger and to define its new relationship with both the Government and
the Bank. In order to better understand its financial situation, and in response to a
Bank request, the HUDC converted the former accounting system of the HC to an
accrual basis similar to that of the former UDD, brought its audits up to date and
opened a completely new balance sheet shortly after the merger;
*     the decision by the Government to no longer build social housing for low income
families. This was not only a major policy change but it also increased the amount of
funds from the UDP3 line of credit which could be used for other purposes;
*     the devaluation of the Jordanian Dinar which required a greater amount of dinars to
be spent for local goods and services in order to draw down the loan. Devaluation
also provoked a decline in real household incomes which made the technical criteria
agreed upon at the time of appraisal unaffordable to the intended project beneficiaries.
HUDC responded by attempting to obtain a larger surplus on its "market" plots in
order to offset the cross subsidies provided to the poorer families;
*     the Gulf Crisis, which started in the summer of 1990 and escalated to a major military
confrontation in early 1991, caused the productivity of the project staff and on-site
contractors to decline significantly. One contractor even invoked the contractual force
mnajeure clause and withdrew from the site altogether. Ships bringing goods to Aqaba
were also delayed as a result of the international blockade which was aimed at
preventing the transhipment of goods to Iraq. The blockade reduced port activity,
jobs and household incomes in the Aqaba area;
*     the reduction of Government salaries for employees working with special government
agencies such as HUDC to regular civil service levels which led to a lowering of
agency morale and to the loss of several key staff members;
4.3    The project was to have been implemented in 6 years but reached a total of almost 8 years
before the loan was closed in June 1995. HUDC estimates that it will take another four years for
residents to build their houses and to fully complete all aspects of the Project.
4.4   Implementation of the initial upgrading site of Salahaddin and the adjacent site developed for
households displaced from the upgrading activity were carried out very quickly. Other UDP3
sponsored projects, however, suffered from a variety of internal and extemal delays. In addition to
the previously mentioned delays caused by the creation of HUDC and the Gulf War, achieving a
consensus among the residents of upgrading areas, for example, proved to be more difficult and time
consuming than originally anticipated. A general reallocation of responsibilities in the housing sector



6                                                           Imnplementation Completion Report
also prompted the Government to halt the development of new sites until the situation could be
clarified.
4.5   Jordan introduced a more open and democratic election process for national and local officials
during the project implementation period which further added to delays. Communities not only
acquired ready-made spokespersons to present their points of view, but had also learned how to
become more forceful in expressing them on their own. Negotiating at the community level became a
time-consuming activity which frequently delayed the implementation of upgrading projects. In
Aqaba, for exarnple, newly-elected officials adopted the cause of shantytown residents in attempting
to have their infrastructure payments reduced to the same level of rates as those being paid by the
general population.
4.6    Because the Government was experiencing a fall in its foreign reserves and shortages in
foreign exchange, it was basically unwilling to cancel funds that Bank missions considered could not
be spent during the period of the Loan. At the time of loan closure, work on 8 sites was still
underway (6 for commnunity facilities and 2 for infrastructure). HUDC possessed the necessary
resources to carry out the remaining work and the Housing Bank pledged that it would continue to
closely supervise project performance. Altogether, roughly US$ 3.2 million was canceled from the
Loan at the time of closure.
S.    Project Sustainability
5.1   The achievements related to the Project's principal objectives have essentially taken hold and
are likely to be sustained. The physical assets produced by the project have been handed over to
individual households and to the various agencies responsible for their operation and maintenance
(e.g., the schools to the Ministry of Education; clinics to the Ministry of Health; roads and sidewalks
to the Ministry of Public Works and Housing and the Local and Regional Authorities; water and
sewerage networks to the National Water and Sanitation Authority; and, electricity to the Jordan
Electricity Authority). Households have responded positively to improved urban services and the
receipt of tenure by further investing in the improvement of their homes. Improvements financed by
the Project have managed to incorporate upgraded areas into the formal fabric of the city and to bring
the operation and maintenance of infrastructure and urban services under the administration of the
responsible agencies.
5.2    While the successful implementation of the UDP3 demonstrated the value and potential of
neighborhood upgrading and provision of affordable serviced sites, neither regional nor local
authorities have as yet come forward to request additional applications. Negotiations between the
Greater Anmnan Municipality (GAM) and HUDC concerning the upgrading of several, small pockets
of underserved areas did not culminate in a project. Similarly, changes in leadership at the Aqaba
Region Authority returned the development focus back towards the relocation of the remaining
shantytown residents to more distant sites on the outskirts of the town. The private sector did
approach HUDC to assist in the re-blocking and tenure regularization of an informally-developed
community located on privately owned land.
5.3   Implementation of the new sites component of the UDP projects has provided the most
significant examples of affordable land subdivision for low and moderate income families in Jordan.
Both the process and products related to UDP site development will serve as models for future private
sector efforts in this type of residential land development. City officials whose cities have benefitted



Implementation Completion Report                                                       7
from UDP projects, have become more aware of the need for affordable standards in order to solve
their housing and urban development problems. The Greater Anmian Municipality, for example, has
recently initiated its own land subdivision exercise in which the proposed residential plot sizes are
significantly smaller than those which have been previously provided through the normal zoning
process.
5.4   The demonstration effect related to the need for comprehensive site layouts, which include
community buildings and commercial and industrial activities as the means of ensuring sustainable
urban development, has not as yet taken hold. Potential reasons for this are, among others, the lack
of adequate planning, short-term maximization of land sales, problems in staffing community
facilities, etc. Some of these issues will be addressed in the HFUSR Project, which was appraised in
November 1995, and will build on the demonstration effect of the three preceding UDP projects.
5.5   The combination of more democratically elected representation and a decline in real incomes,
provoked communities that were being upgraded to question project pricing policies and to express
their unwillingness to pay any infrastructure rates that were higher than those normally charged to
others. Actual charges were consequently reduced to the standard level of payment. The result was
that part of the services, whose benefits were enjoyed solely by individual households, were now
being covered by general fees and taxes rather than by land prices and user charges as originally set
out in the SAR. This practice does not appear to be sustainable.
5.6   The payment levels for land and infrastructure for new sites, however, were not such an
issue. The HUDC did charge below market prices for land in some of its sub-projects in order to
make these plots affordable to households below the 40th percentile.
5.7   In retrospect, project cost recovery objectives may have been too optimistic for the upgrading
component of the Project. Pricing policies related to urban utilities and services may be too
politically inflexible to serve as the vehicle for recovering a large part of the infrastructure investment
costs involved in upgrading. It may simply have been too ambitious to suppose that the relatively
small amount of UDP3 upgrading projects would be able to be able to serve as a catalyst in resolving
this issue.
6.    Bank Performance
6.1    Bank performance was satisfactory. The Project was properly prepared and appraised. The
Project was supervised on a regular basis. Whenever a change in Bank supervisory staff was to be
made, both old and new staff members overlapped as team members during at least one field rnission.
There was never any mission which did not include at least one person who had previously worked on
the Project.
6.2    Bank assistance was readily available throughout and Bank staff worked closely with the
HUDC to coordinate the preparation and appraisal of an innovative follow-up project, which has been
described in an annual sector report by the Transportation Water and Urban Development Department
as one of the first to implement the Bank's new policies.

7.    Borrower Performance
7.1    Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Except for delays in the resumption of work
following the reorganization of the sector and the Gulf Crisis which followed inmmediately thereafter,
the project implementing entities did a commendable job. Most notably, they were able to:
(i)    surpass the agreed upon targets for physical improvements while keeping public sector
construction of houses to a number lower than the agreed ceiling at the time of
appraisal;
(ii)   upgrade the accounts of the former HC to an accrual basis;
(iii)   discontinue the former HC's role as a housing finance agency;
(iv)   engage in a business planning exercise to determine the most appropriate HUDC role
in improving housing sector performance in Jordan;
(v)    engage consultants to help HUDC to analyze the options for divesting those functions
which could be implemented more effectively by the private sector;
(vi)   establish a project appraisal function in the local lending agency to improve the
dialogue and coordination with private developers;
(vii)  set up a program that would enable construction financing to developers to be rolled
over into mortgage loans for the buyers of their units; and,
(viii)  take the lead in preparing for the establishment of a Secondary Mortgage Facility
which would be a public shareholder company.
S.    Assessment of Outcome
8.1    Overall, the project had a satisfactory outcome.
8.2    The fact that a few of the institutional objectives fell short of the results anticipated at the time
of project appraisal seems to be largely due to the complexity of market forces and an incomplete
understanding of the required conditions to encourage fornal private sector provision of housing for
low and moderate income households. Removing privileges formerly provided to public sector
housing agencies is just one of the steps to encourage private sector production of UDP3 like projects.
8.3    The burden of having to make below-market interest rate mortgage loans to project
beneficiaries, resulted in the HB putting a cap on the amount of resources it was willing to lend under
these conditions. The situation at the time was not sufficiently attractive for other Banks to initiate
their participation in the market. The HFUSR Project will attempt to address many of these
shortcomings.
8.4    Briefly stated, project elements and activities which worked well included: the physical results
of the four upgrading and nine sites and services projects; the continued excellence in establishing
conmnunity relation activities which was considered to be an example of "best practices" by the



Implementation Completion Report                                                       9
Bank; the conviction held by all sides that agencies and residents needed to work closely together to
achieve positive results; and the acceptance of operation and maintenance responsibilities by both
agencies and individuals.
8.5    Elements that could have been done better included: the continued reliance on hidden
subsidies (e.g., land and administrative costs) to improve the affordability of programs; the limited
dialogue with private sector developers; the poor selection of certain contractors; the lack of a clear
definition of housing delivery responsibilities due to policy and institutional changes; the achievement
of only partial cost recovery; and the inability to maximize the positive effects of local involvement in
the Project.
9.    Future Operation
9.1    Operation and maintenance of the physical assets completed prior to the closure of the Loan
were handed over to the responsible service agencies. The well mnaintained nature of the sites
developed or improved under earlier projects suggests that similarly good performance can be
expected for those developed under UDP3. In addition, the residents themselves have been actively
involved by maintaining their homes and lobbying local authorities and service agencies to ensure that
they carry out their respective operation and maintenance responsibilities.
9.2    The Housing Bank, as stated in its operating plan, will closely monitor sites which are still
under construction and will also follow-up with borrowers. Less than 1 percent of the loans extended
during the early phase of this and previous UDP projects have had repayment problems. Under
measures agreed to as part of the Economic Reform and Development Loan and the Housing Finance
and Urban Sector Reform Project, the World Bank is supporting improvements in the efficiency with
which longer-term financial flows for mortgage lending are being mobilized to facilitate and foster
competition in market-based mortgage lending. This success of this activity would bring other banks
into the area of housing finance.
10.   Key Lessons Learned
10.1  The UDP3 Project provided a much better understanding of the considerable degree of caution
and risk involved in market oriented decisions made by private developers. Most developers in
Jordan are small, individually owned companies which cannot easily write-off their losses. To
encourage these developers to move down market from their traditional middle class client base will
require an enabling environment that is fair and open to competition. UDP3 has taken a few of the
first steps towards establishing such an environment upon which the HFUSR Project will build and
expand.
10.2   A key lesson learned is that deeper and more fundamental changes in the housing delivery
system are required to ensure the replicability and economic efficiency of providing formal private
sector housing. Such efforts must necessarily have the full commitment and support of the
Governmnent at both the national and local levels.
10.3  Private sector involvement in housing delivery increases the number of the stakeholders and
decision makers involved in the process. As a result, the "enabling environment" within which these
stakeholders are required to work becomes increasingly important. The UDP3 Project has helped the
Government to cross a major threshold in favor of establishing an enabling approach and to accept



10                                                      Implementation Completion Report
less direct control over the ultimate housing outcomes. Housing production under such an enabling
approach is generally more incremental and time consuming than direct public sector intervention.
10.4  The Project also showed the need for a local "champion" or leader in the housing sector that
can perceive the gaps and bottlenecks in housing delivery system and recomnmend practical measures
that will lead to their resolution. Recognizing the role of the public sector as that of "enabler" and
not as a privileged competitor to the private sector will require a major change in thinking and modes
of operation by many of the decision makers and agencies currently involved in the housing sector.
10.5 Both the Bank and the Jordanian Government have learned that they will need to make
fuindamental changes in their thinking and approach to the delivery of housing for low and moderate
income households. The follow-up HFUSR Project, based on studies conducted as part of UDP3,
will substantially contribute to this process.
10.6  The introduction of more democratic processes into conmmunity decision making and
management dramatically increased the importance of communication and coordination within housing
projects between the providers and the users. As communities become increasingly more politically
aware and articulate, greater attention needs to be paid to the issues of equity in determining the
physical improvements to be made and the costs to be charged.

JORDAN: SUPERVISION OF THE NATIONAL URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Ln. 2B41-JO)
Aide Memoire
January 31- February 14, 1995
1.    A World Bank mission visited Jordan during the period January 31-
February 14, 1995 to supervise progress with implementation of the above
project.  Mission members were Ms. Faye Lumsden (Operations Officer) Task
Manager,  and Mr. Mohammed Feghoul (Municipal Engineer).      The mission met
with representatives of the Ministry of Planning (MOP), The Housing and Urban
Development Corporation (HUDC) ,    the Jordan Housing Bank  (JHB) and the
Cities and villages Development Bank  (CVDB) during their stay.   In the
company of the staff of HUDC's Projects and Corporate Planning Units of the
HUDC, mission members also visited sites with ongoing work under the project
(Irbid-Beit A1 Ras; Salt-Al-Maghareeb; Ain Al Basha; Zarqa 1 & 2). Mr.
Deane Jordan (Senior Economist), new Task Manager of the proposed Housing
and Urban Sector Reform Project,   joined the mission during the period
February 10-14 to be introduced to HUDC' s senior management and to officials
in the Ministry of Planning in charge of the Urban sector.
2.   The mission members wish to thank their Jordanian counterparts for the
hospitality extended to them along with the full collaboration during the
review of progress. The mission was pleased to note the continued good
progress In accelerating progress with iTplementation as well as
organizational restructuring.
3.    This aide mamoire summarizes the mission's findings and recommendations
and agreements reached and is subject to confirmation by the management of
the World Bank.
STM4ARY_ OF PRINCrPAL FINDINGS & AGRREMENTS
4.    Despite the recent good performance, the mission estimated that about
US$ 2.84 million (HUDC estimate is US$ 2.26m) would remain undisbursed and
be cancelled.  About  JD 1.230 million (US$ 1.75m)   (HUDC estimate is JD
0.670m - US$ 0.96m) will need to be found from other sources for work to be
completed and goods to be delivered after June 15, 1995. This money will be
primarily for construction, furnishing, and equipping community buildings
(i.e non-recoverable costs).
5.   Throughout this aide memoire HUDC's estimates are provided where they
differ from that of the mission. This is to allow for contingency budgeting.
The mission:
-    In order to accelerate procurement of goods (furniture and equipment
for schools), particularly PCs and educational equipment, HUDC requested
to procure them through Local competitive Bidding. The mission will review
this request and respond by February 28, 1995.
The HUDC will:
-    recruit (preferably internally) by March 15, 1995 a project manager to
conduct the computerization project.
-     send the evaluation report related to the selection of consultant for
the privatization studies for review by the Bank before February 28,1995.



APPENDIX A
Page 2 of 19
-    provide to the Bank copies of the decisions (and mandate) establishing
the Steering Committee and the Working Group to undertake the privatization
studies.
prepare and send to the Bank for review a memorandum on the
possible substitution of bank guarantees for retention provisions for advance
repayments (with a sample of works contract amendment attached) by February
28, 1995.
-    establish  a comprehensive  plan of project operation and send it to
the Bank for review before May 31, 1995 in order to facilitate the work of
the completion mission. HUDC designated the Head of Corporate Planning Unit
to coordinate the preparation of the Implementation Completion Report.
-    HUDC to advise the Bank by March 15, 1995 of arrangements for financing
the JD 1.6 million of works to be done and goods to be delivered after June
1S, 1995.
DI1URSEME!NT PROMNQ
6.   As of January 26, 1995  US$ 19.285 million of the loan amount of US$
26.4 million had been disbursed. This represents 731 of the total, which
should have been fully disbursed at this time.   However, disbursement
performance has improved: US$ 5.5m was disbursed in the seven-month period
between June 1, 1994 and January 26, 1995, versus US$ 3.44m in the five-month
period between January 1, 1994 and May 31, 1994, US$ 2.23m in 1993 and US$
2.72m in 1992.
7.   As a result of a detailed review of the status of contracts underway,
the mission concluded that HUDC would withdraw up to US$ 23.56 million ( HUDC
estimate US$ 24.14m) and that the balance likely to remain undisbursed would
be US$ 2.84 million  (HUDC estimate is US$ 2.26m)   (Tables   7.a & 7.b
attached).
8.   The March 1994 amendment to the Loan Agreement, among other things,
permits HUDC to utilize loan proceeds for consultants to assist them with
the preparation of a Business Plan. The HUDC privatization, which is an
integral part of HUDC's Business Planning process supported by this project,
is now being undertaken within the framework of the proposed Housing and
Urban Sector Reform project.    HUDC will shortly finalize ( by   February
15, 1995) the technical and financial evaluations of four offers received
from the shortlisted consultants to provide the expertise not available in-
house. The five following studies would be carried out:
(a). Functional and financial parameters of the Private Production Entity;
(b). Analysis of the Financial Portfolio of the HUDCI
(c). Analysis of HUDC's Land Holdings;
{d). Disposition of HUDC Activities and Staff  and
{e). Facilitating Private Sector Land and Housing Development.
9.   The  work outlined in the TORe for these studies would be undertaken
by a Working Group (including external professionals) to be established for
this purpose   which would  report to a Steering Committee set up at the
Cabinet level. HUDC will provide the Bank with copies of the decisions and
mandates related to the Steering Committee and -the working group.

AUDIT OF FINACIAL STATEMENTS
10.   The mission was advised that HUDC is making arrangements for the early
completion of its audit report for 1994 (due June 30, 1995) to facilitate the
work of the organizational development consultants. The auditors have been
engaged with an April 30, 1995 target for completion.
CIVIL AND BlILDING WORKS
11.   Although continuing improvement in project implementation was noticed,
the mission expressed its concern regarding specific projects which will
not be completed by the closing date of the Loan. Table 1 (attached) shows
the status of all the civil works and building contracts, and indicates for
each site the amount of work likely to be executed after June 15, 1995.
12.   The mission visited  the following sites: Irbid-Beit Al Ras;
Salt-Al-Maghareebs Ain-Al-Basha; Zarqa 1 & 2.  All sites visited by the
mission had. competent teams of engineers and technicians backed by efficient
teams within HUDC' s Design and Planning units. Detailed bar charts and plans
of completed works were available, however they were not regularly updated
in all sites.
13.   The mission was satisfied both with the quality of construction and
rate of progress on the sites under implementation. However the following
concerns are worth mentioning: (i) almost all the sites are facing
difficulties in having their water system connected before the completion;
(ii) coordination with the Electricity Authority for connections should be
improved,   and,   action should   be taken to remedy the situation of
unprotected   electrical transformers;    and (iii)   specific actions are
needed to resolve difficulties with the sewerage connection for two sites
(Zarqa , and Ain Al Basha).
.4.   The packaging of the two contracts per site (one contract for site and
services and the second one  for the buildings)  has  resulted in each
contractor having had to provide offices and equipment for the supervision
of the same site at the expenses of HUDC. These unnecessary expenses should
have been avoided by requiring only the first contractor to be mobilized to
provide offices and facilities for the project management.
15.   To maximize utilization of loan proceeds, HUDC should review all the
ongoing work contracts to evaluate the trade off of replacing retention
provisions for repayment of advance payments with bank guarantees to be
provided by contractors. A memorandum with a sample of the proposed works
contract amendment attached should be prepared for Bank review prior to
finalization.
Statug of Imolementation
Amman - Marcab:
16.   This   site which  has  an area of 180,000  m2  and comprises  the
development of 360 plots ( 308 vacant residential plots, 35 core residential
units, and 17 vacant commercial plots), plus  community buildings (boys
school, girls school, community center, and health center) was fully
completed April, 1994.



APPENDIX A
Page 4 of 19
Amman  - Tavbeh:
17.  Of a total area of 193,000 m2, it comprises the development of 504
vacant plots (484 residential,  19 commercial), and the following community
buildings: boys school, girls school, community center, and health center.
The infrastructure works are about 95 t completed, and should be completed
by April 15, 1995 three  months behind the latest schedule.  The buildings
works which were awarded in February, 1994 will be completed by August 31,
1995 three months behind schedule. The amount of work to be executed after
June 15, 1995 to complete the buildings is estimated at JD.165,000.
Amman -Manara-4!
18.  The site has a total area of 196,499 m2 and comprises the development
of 459 vacant plots (438 residential, and 20 commercial), and the following
community buildings: girls school, community center, and health center. After
overcoming severe difficulties due to the excavation of hard soil, the
works progress was   satisfactory, and the site is expected to be fully
completed by March 18, 199S as contracted.  It is worth noting that in one
of the few projects which will be completed in time. Credit for this should
be given to HUDC's site team and also to the capability of the contractor.
Amman -Zaraa 1 & 2:
19.  The site has a total area of 374,000 m2, comprises the development of
1,137 residential and commercial plots divided in two zones Zarqa 1 and Zarqa
2, and the following community buildings: girl. school, boys school,
community center, and health center.  Infrastructure works which started
February 27, 1994 are of good quality,  show a progress of 89t,  and are
expected to be fully completed three months behind contractual schedule.
These delays occurred at the opening of the site due to the unanticipated
need to remove old water pipes. The contractor, which was involved in an
earlier HUDC project (Ruseifa), worked in two shifts to make up for lost
time.  Contracts for the construction of the four community buildings have
been awarded recently (order to start the work was issued June 11,1994). The
mission during its visit estimated a progress of 40 t and evaluated the work
to be executed after June 15, 1995 to complete the buildings at JD 485,000
(HUDC's estimate is JD 248,000). They will be delivered as follows: Boys
School November 30, 19951 Girls School which was relocated due to the weak
bearing capacity of the initial site, will be delivered February 28, 1996,
Health Center and Community Center September 30, 1995.
20.  The connection of the site sewerage network to the main sewer line
located along a municipal road at 240 meters from the site is not yet
executed. To allow the contractor to execute this work Zarqa Municipality
should plan a road  (on   private land)   to authorize HUDC to lay this
connection following planned road alignment as requested by law.
Salt Al Machareeb
21.  The site has a total area of 135,971 m2,  comprises the development of
371 plots (309 residential vacant plots; 23 core units; and 39 vacant
commercial plots), and the following community buildings: community center,
and health center. The infrastructure works which started March, 1994 show
a progress of 50 and are expected to be completed by August 31, 1995 five
months behind schedule. The buildings will be delivered by June 15, 1995 with
four months delay. To complete this project JD. 200,000 (HUDC's estimate is

22. Expensive on-site infrastructure and sewerage system (three septic
tanks) were necessitated by topographically difficulties and remoteness of
the site.
,Salt MAin Al-Basha
23. The site has a total area of 189,604 m2, comprises the development of
554 vacant plots (526 residential, and 28 commercial), and the following
community buildings: boys school, girls school, community center, and health
center. The progress of infrastructure works, which started February 19,
1994, show a progress of 62% and will be completed by May 15, 1995; while the
buildings with a progress of 60S will be delivered June 15, 1995.
24. The resident engineer should notify to the contractor to remove all the
blocks and stones left on the site. There are also two critical tasks to be
closely monitored: (i) 2, 000 meters water connection along the main national
road which will be improved with a possible revision of its alignment; and
(ii)  the connection of the on-site sewerage system to the near  waste water
treatment plant.
25. The related contract to reach the waste water station is not yet
concluded. Given the risk of ground water pollution, the mission asked for
an action plan for solving this critical problem in a timely manner.
irbid   - Beit -Ras
26. The site has a total area of 304,000 m2 and comprises the development
of 767 residential plots and one large parcel for commercial plots. The site
is provided with: Boys School, Girls School, Heath Center, Community Center,
Women's Training Center.       The mission visited the site and noted its
satisfactory completion. The main entrance to the site is provided by a road
with a steady slope. (17S) but which lacks proper drainage and sidewalk on
one    side  (not  included  in  the  project  and  which  belongs  to  the
municipality).   This site faced at its opening  difficulties related to
expansive soil and underground caves found during foundation works. The
electrical transformer equipment recently put in place by the Electricity
Authority was exposed to the elements. This situation also encountered in
other sites should be remedied in a timely manner.
agaaba -    Al - Khazan
27. This site has a total area of 1194,441 m2, comprises the development
of 631 resldential and commercial plots, and the following community
buildings: Women's Training Center, and Health Center. Site development was
satisfactorily completed October 31, 1992 and the last building (Health
Center) was delivered August 31, 1994.
aaaba   - Old town  North
28. The project which consists of the upgrading of an area of 120,362 m2
in the Old Town, to provide services to 384 households indicates a progress
of 85  and is expected to be completed by May 9, 1995.   Support from the
Aqaba Municipality to manage the relocation of households whose units were
demolished in whole or in part was notable for permitting   the progress
recorded.

Aaaba   -    Old-Town-South
29. This project which consists of the upgrading of a densely populated low-
income area of the old part of Aqaba, with an area of 122, 916 m2, serving 609
plots, including the creation of 23 infill plots for new construction, was
satisfactorily completed June 22, 1994.
Aaaba Community Buildincs
30.   The construction of  the Health Center started February 1, 1995 and
will be completed by November 28, 1995. A Community Center is also under
construction and will be delivered by June 30, 1995.   The value of the
outstanding work after the loan closing date is estimated to be   about
JD.45,000.
Other sites
31.   The other sites financed under this project were completed as follows:
Aqaba Salahaddin (upgrading) January 18,19891   Aqaba Shalalah (upgrading)
June 18, and December 199Lt   Aqaba Khazan October 31,1992 for site and
services and August 31, 1994 for the Health center.
FRIsITURR & EOtIPMENT FOR _0MUNITY BUILDI_GS
32.  The program of furniture and equipment to be financed under the project
encompasses the following items:
-     11 Schools: Furniture, PC computers, and 9 categories of equipmenti
-     9  Community Centers: Furniture, and Electrical Appliances;
-     4  Health Centers: Dental Equipment;
-     7 Health Centers: Furniture, Medical Equipment, Electrical Appliances.
33.  Only 4 Schools were partially furnished and equipped.  The main part
of the program ls not executed with the outstanding part to be implemented
after the loan closing date estimated at about JD 350,000. This situation
is due to the late start of this procurement task and unnecessary lengthy
HUDC procurement procedures.
34.   HUDC plans to procure the outstanding items through Local Competitive
Bidding procedures.
HUDC COMPUTERIZATION
35.  The contracts related to HUDC's computerization  were awarded December
6, 1994. In order to complete a large part of this program before June 15,
1995,   their implementation started immediately after the supplier and
application developer were selected. The time schedule is as follows:
Hardware :              5  months   January 1,  to   May 31, 1995
Applications:           9  months   January 1,  to   August 31, 1995
36.  To complete the program HUDC will need  about JD.150,000  (JD.lO0,000
for hardware and JD.50,000 for applications) to fund completion of delivery
after the loan closing date.   HUDC's estimate is only JD 50,000 for
applications.
37.   Specific meetings were organized for the mission with the Royal
Sciences Society (RSS) mandated for 20 months (August 31,1995 to March
31,1997)  to  support  HUDCs  computerization project,  and  the  Hardware

supplier and the  Applications developer to assess:        (i) implementation
coordination,   (ii)  involvement of HUDC staff in application development,
and   (iii)   consistency among the various  systems to be implemented
(Administration,  Finance,  Beneficiaries,  Projects,  ..)   to realize   an
efficient information system which could evolve with the objectives and the
needs of the Corporation.
38.   The mission was  informed  that HUDC has  been  having difficulty
recruiting competent replacement project manager due to civil service rules.
HUDC should, without delay, appoint a project manager to carry out this
crucial project, or this investment could be jeopardized.
CITIES AND VILLAGES DEVELOPMENT BANK
39.  The mission met with representatives of the Cities and villages
Development Bank (CVDB) to inform them about the objectives of the mission
particularly about the imminent completion of the project and the
Implementation Completion Report to be prepared by all the agencies that
were  involved  in  its  implementation.       During  this  meeting,  CVDB
representatives drew the attention of the mission on the following to be
clarified with HUDC:
-    long delays are observed, compared to what was recorded at the
beginning of the project, for CVDB to receive the funds related to the
project from the Ministry of Planning;
-    CVDB was asked by HUDC to deposit about JD.200,000 for the Water
Authority to for connect   Ain Al basha site to the nearby waste water
treatment Plant. CVDB is not allowed to disburse funds only after work has
been completed.
40.   CVDB and the mission discussed the options for reviewing the Municipal
Finance Study undertaken by the World bank in 1994. They concluded that two
seminars/workshops would be appropriate and that the Bank should be Involved
in the first one.
IMP EMENTATION COMPLETION REPORTING
41.  The mission informed HUDC of the objectives of the   forthcoming
implementation completion mission which are to : (i) assess: the degree of
achievement  of  project  objectives,        prospects  for  the  project's
sustainability, Bank and Borrower performance,   project outcome, and the
plan for the project future operation; and (ii) identify the lessons to
be learned from implementation. The Implementation Completion Report (ICR)
should provide data and analysis to substantiate assessment.
42.   The Borrower prepares  and makes available  to the Bank its  own
evaluation report on:  (i) the project's execution and initial operation,
{ii) cost and benefits,  (iii) the Bank and Borrower's performance of their
respective obligations under the Loan Agreement;  (iv)  and the extent to
which the purposes of the loan were achieved.
43.   The Borrower  is  also  requested  to adopt  a  comprehensive  plan,
acceptable to the Bank, for the operational phase of the project. Such a
plan would help assure that beneficiaries will profit from the project. The
plan should also include performance indicators to monitor operations and
development impact. It should be sent to the Bank for review before May 31,
1995.

44. The views of following agencies and authorities should be sought on
project implementation,   performance, and operation (urban services, and
municipal management):
- Ministry of Planning                   - Aqaba Regional Authority ARA
- Ministry of Education                  - Aqaba Municipality
- Vocational Training Corporation        - Greater Amman Municipality
- Ministry of Heath                      - Zarqa Municipality
- Ministry of Health                     - Salt Municipality
- Housing Bank                           - Beit Al Ras  Municipality
- Cities & Villages Development Bank (CVDB )
- Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDC)
45. Most The above ministries and agencies may provide their views to HUDC
for incorporation in their document. The Housing Bank indicated to the
mission that they would prepare an independent section of the report. This
would help ensure that their perspectives is more fully reflected than was
the case for the Project Completion Reports (PCR) for previous urban
development  project.    A  committee  should  be  established  to  ensure
coordination as provided for in the project appraisal report.
46. Special surveys should be carried out of beneficiaries of the upgraded
sites and of the new sites and services. Affordability should be reassessed.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors, and  Suppliers   should also be
evaluated during this exercise.
MARKETING
47. In order to better understand the behavior of the market during project
implementation, the mission requested HUDC to provide a schedule of plots
auctions which details on the development costs, number of bids received,
amounts offered, plots type and site. This schedule should be ready by May
31, 1995.

INFRASTRUCTURE DIVISION - MT2IN
nVDENTORY OF PROJECT COVENANTED STUDIES AS OF February 1995
initially there were no studies under this project. The Loan Agreement was
amended in March 1994 to, among other things, permit the NUOC to utilize loan
proceeds for consultants to assist them with the preparation of a Business Plan.
On the basis of the first phase of studies, the huvC reorganized itself to
separate policy-making from implementation and to improve efficiency and
effectiveness. Based on further analysis/deliberation, HUDC has proposed to
finalize its compercial activities (new site development and the management of a
mortgage portfolio). During the June 1994, supervision mission, within the context
of preparing a proposed Housing and Urban Sector Restructuring Project TORs were
prepared by the mission and accepted by the Borrower for further studies for guiding
implementation of the Business Plan proposals. The Request of Proposals (RFPs)
documentation was reviewed by the November 1994, mission.The five studies agreed on
are:
1.    )nalvsis of Vtmctional and Financial Parameters o  the Private Production
Zntity (PPB)- The objective of this study is to design a PPB that will
survive and prosper on an unsubsidized basis through the development of
serviced plots (and housing units if so decided) for low-and-moderate-income
households.
2.    Study of Financial Portfolio of HJDC. The objective is to establish all
necessary legal and financial parameters that might influence the choice of
options. The goal is to deploy the portfolio in a manner that maximizes its
value and protects it from political intervention.
3 *   study of Land Koldin s of HUDC.The objective is to establish all necessary
legal and market parameters that might influence the choice of options. The
goal is to deploy the portfolio in a manner that maximizes its value and
usefulness in eventual development.
4.    Disnosition of Other Activities and Staff The objectives are (i) to
rationalize the portion within the Government of the remaining activities of
HNDC and (ii) to assure the right. of all current HUDC employees to Government
employment, to assistance in finding employment elsewhere, or to whatever
separation benefits are due.
S.   lFalitatina Private 8-ctor Land and Rousina Develonment.The objective is to
identify the key barriers to formal sector development and/or comparative
advantages to informal sector development, for low- and moderate-income
households.
NUDC will shortly finalize award the contract for these studies after
completing (by end of February 1995) the technical and financial evaluations of
four offers received from the ahortlisted consultants to provide the expertise not
available in-house.

Introduction :-
The Third Urban Development Project was planned to provide shelter and
related services at prices affordable to low-income households The main purpose
of the project was to improve the housing standards of the poor, and to give them
adequate access to social services .
The project would support the housing policy initiatives in developing new
sites, low cost housing construction, and upgrading of squatter areas with low
S deficiencies, throughout Jordan. It adopted the basic approach, with heavy
emphasis on affordability, cost recovery, and community involvement.
The Project loan was closed on 15/6/1995.At that date most of the sites were
completed, but still some sites were not ready.
HUDC has planned, designed, and implemented the land development in
cooperation with local authorities. Upon project completion, local authorities,
concemed ministries, and agencies would operate and maintain the social and
technical infrastructure facilities.
The Project comprises of thirteen sites as shown in the following table (i): Four
being upgrading sites ( in Aqaba Region ), and the other nine sites are ( sites &
services ) ( in different areas of Jordan ) . AU the sites include a full complement
of physical and social infrastructure services, in addition to community and
commercial facilities according to site needs.

causes for delay.

The previous two tables show  the marketing statms for UDP3 site . The following
notes must be mentioned
1. The sites: Ain EI-Basha, Salt are still not completed. Zarqa site has been
recently handed over, marketing has not started yet . The property Directorate
is expecting to start marketing as follows:
Zarqa                August,    1995.
Ain EI-Basha        September, 1995
Salt                September, 1995.
HUDC received till now 17000 applications for savimg program of these sites . They
plan to sell all these plots by the end of 1997 . The beneficiary plots were specified,
down payments were paid and monthly saving installments are being paid to banks.
Plots in Taybeh site are also planned to be sold by the end of 1997.
2. Beit Ras site was completed in July, 1994 but the percentage of sold plots is low
(13%) .That was due to the unreadiness of services such as water and electricity ,
in addition to the difficult coordination between H.B & beneficiaries. Propert
directorate is though expecting an increase in the percentage, as the services
problems have been solved.
3. Khazan site was complete since 1993 , but still 84 plots are under marketing
procedure. Efforts are made to promote the marketing process.
4. Plots in Marqab and Hamlan sites are almost sold, except five plots in Hamlan
and the market plots in Marqab . Property directorate is studying to sell the market
plots as beneficiary plots prices.

5. Although the upgrading sites in Aqaba ( Salahaddin and sliallalah ) were
completed early 1988, 1990, the percentage of sold plots in Salahaddin is (89%)
and m Shallalah (N) (84%). Some residents acquiring the vacant plots refuse to
payments cormmitments , as they insist to obtain the titles of their plots in
advance . Land and Survey Department will prepare the parcellation plan and
the titles as soon as the controversy of boundaries in Salahaddin site is solved.

APPENDIX B
Page 16 of 30
Evaluating and pricing of the plots are conducted in the following manner:
About 35 percent of the serviced land at market prices to housing developers ,or in
larger plots to higher income families. The surplus generated in this manner would be
used for cross subsidies to reduce the price of smaller plots sold to families in the
target group (10th to 40th percentile of the income distribution) .
Affordability :-
A. NewSites:-
In the appraisal study, the target group for new sites comprised of Jordanian
families in the 10th to 40th percentile of the income distribution. Based on the
Previous projects experience, it has been assumed that target group families would
be able to pay up to (33%) of their total monthly household incomes on the shelter,
plus at least (10%) of the total plot cost as a down- payment.
To assess affordability in UDP3 project, applications of beneficiaries for the
completed UDP3 sites: Taybeh, Salt, Zarqa, Manara(4) and Ain El-Basah were
studied. Data about households income included in those applications, were
considered as indicators of affordability.
- Noticeable demand on large plots , although price of these plots was relatively
high .
- Incomes of the applicants were relatively low: 12.6% of the households incomes
wereabout 125 ID.
Other incomes were studied showing the incomes needed in order to be able to
pay the monthly installments .
(33%) of the households cannot afford to pay for the cheapest plots + building
loans.
(72%) of the households cannot afford to pay for the plots of highest prices +
building loans .
B. Upgrading :-
In the appraisal study, the objective was that the recoverable costs of the upgrading
works were affordable to the exisdng residents of the site . The monthly mortgage
payment was studied to be (15 to 20%) of median monthly family income,
depending on site .
The cost estimates showed the upgrading schemes to be affordable to the
households within the target income groups .
No recent surveys were done for these sites to assess the residents affordability.
Cost recovery problems encountered in upgrading sites are indicators of residents
unaffordability . This may be a result of the gulf crisis and the Aqaba port
blockade, that had a negative impact on the residents affordability to pay.

APPENDIX B
Cost Recovery:                                            Page 17 of 30
It is expected that Project's costs will be recovered as follows:
A. Costs recovered from beneficiaries : the cost of raw land and on-site
infrastructure through repayments (property sales to beneficiaries).
In UDP3 ,repayments in most of the sites proved to be successful . This may be
attributed to the cash money paid by beneficiaries to HUDC through HB,
according to an agreement between HUDC & RB.
Repayments in Aqaba projects and particularly in the upgrading sites has
presented difficulties .That may be attributed to the following reasons :-
- Residents are requesting HUDC to reduce the monthly installments, and to
exempt them from paying interests on loans .
- Some residents are not Jordanians , they are either Egyptians, from Gaza Strip,
or from Saudi Arabia. Law doesn't allow giving them ownerships.
- In Khazan site, ilthough it has a good location, but the marketing & repayment
processes ore not going well. All the market plots are sold, part of the payments
is paid, the rest will be paid within a year.
Efforts are made by the Property Directorate to overcome these difficulties.
B. Costs not recovered from beneficiaries : the cost of community buildings and
off-site services finnmced by the government of Jordan (80% from WB loan,
20% from its own treasury). These costs would be recovered through taxes.
Occupancy of plots by benefclaries :.
l.The JH extends loans for UDP3 beneficiaries for purchasing land and core
units in addition to building material loans (BM) for the construction or the
extention of these plots. The following table shows mumbers and amounts of
loans ranted by JHB  to beneficiaries of the Project (in s&s sites) classified
according to loan purposes covering the period from the beginning of sales in
1988 up to August - 1995 .

APPENDIX B
Page 18 of 30
It follows from above that total loan sales covering land and core units purchase up
to August 95 amounts to  4,103,700 JD, representing 81% and 70% of total
numbers and values of total sales respectively. These percentages exceeded so far
what was achieved in the pervious projects, as only 62.5% of uwits in UDP2 were
sold through loans representing 60,4% of total sales value. This is an indication of
the increasing dependence on loans from the JIHB for attaining land and co,and is
most likely to continue to dominate sales pattern during the operation phase of
UDP3.
In the meantime , building materials loans up to August 95 amounts to 674,000 JD
representing 12%and 16% of total numbers and values of overall loan value
extended-by JB.
2. No. of licensed plots for building the units in (S&S) =368
These licensed plots are in Hamlan, Marqab and Beit Ras sites.
3. Although around six years passed after the civil works in Aqaba upg. sites had
been completed, the percentage of residents who attained building licenses
didn't exceed (24%). ARA is connecting the water & electicity services to the
units without attining occupation pemiits for their dwellings.
Benefeciaries ILteraction :
Since some sites are not ready yet, and not more than 56% of the ready plots are
sold, the interaction of the beneficiaries towards their new conmmuity cannot be
determined so far. The assumption here is: at least 50% of the sites have to be
inhabited by the residents for at least one to two years, in order to assess their
interaction.
On the other hand, in Aqaba upgrading projects ( Salahaddin, Shallalah (N)).
residents interaction can be assessed, since it has already been inhabited by
residents. No recent surveys were done in these sites, but a study was conducted
by HUDC in cooperation with Harvard University in 1993, to assess the
sustainability of services. The mnsin findings from this study were:
- The residents were satisfied with the level of services provided libe sewerage
and roads network in Salahaddin but in Sballalah (N) they were complaining of
the sevices and of the narrow pathways in the site.
- The residents had planted trees at the pavements sides to improve the area in
Salahaddin, but they are not using the green areas of the site.
- The residents were contributing positively in cleaning around their dwellings in
Salahaddin.
- Resindents were following up with the concerned authorities to maintain the
services within the Salahaddin site, but in Shallalah they neglected the

Feedback from the authorities concerned :-
Views of agencies and authorities ( urban services, and municipal management)
were sought on UDP3 project implementation , performance , and operation, in
order to ensure that their perspectives were reflected in the project .Some of them,
like The Municipality of Aqaba, did not answer in spite of  insistence of
having their view, others answered briefly like The Ministry of Planing . B sent
a seperate report on operation plan to the World Bank.
Following are views and remarks of the ministries and authorities that responded
to our request:
1. Ministry of Health :-
- Sites of health centers should be selected near the centre of the site and near to
population density.
- A suggestion to replac the lme silicate brick used in facade with stone or
concrete blocks . This will maintain the sustainability of the structure, and
eliminate the cracks resulting from the use of lime bricks .
- HUDC should start constructing future health centers, when the beneficiares in
the sites start building their units .
- Operation of these centers will start when the sites are inhabited by the residents.
2. Minitry of Education :-
R*egarding UDP3 schools, the desigs and implementation wero according to the
reqrements of Ministry of Education . Operadon of these schools is planned to
take place in the semester following the handing over of each school .
3. Munleipality of Greater Amman :-
- Sites selection was successful.
- Desgns an d plots sizes were suitable for target groups.
- Width of Roads and footpath was not convenient for serving most of the plots.
- Coordination between GAM & HUDC should take plaoe  fore the design phase
In order to avoid problems of connecting the site with off-site roads network.
4. Zarqa Municipality :-
- Site is located south - east of Zarqa city and to the west of Zarqa - Syria
highway, which is a vital highway since Zarqa Private University is located
nearby. To the west of the highway is located the new governmental
deptments complex.
- Site has a relatively high locadon overlooldng the western part of &qa city .
Near to the site is the new governmental departments complex, that adds to the
site attractive points regarding marketing prospectives .
16



APPENDIX B
Page 20 of 30
- The area is regarded as an extension of Jabal Tarek district, which is attractive as
it is near to Arriman .
- Site can be easily served by transportation without affecting the existing traffic.
- The site is regarded as a distinctive example of an integral site since it contains
all the needed services: paved roads, sewerage, water, electricity, pavements,
schools, health & community centers, commercial shops, a training center and a
mosque.
- The design, execution, location, and the small parcelled plots are all marketing
elements of attraction to limited income households. Those people cannot find
within the area similar plots with the same distinctive specifications.
5. Salt Municipality :-
- The main services needed in the site are complete.
- Transportation to the site is not sufficient, as the existing roads leading to the site
are irrelevant to the traffic.
- Location of the site is beyond the zoning area and in the agricultural area. Sizes
of plots are different from the nearby zoning area.
* The essential central services are far from the site, as it is at the westem end of
Salt city.
- Site would be more attractive for marketing if it was selected in the eastern part
of salt, this would result in converse immigration.
6. Belt Ras Municipality.
- Site location is convenient and all the necessary services are available.
- Plots prices are relatively high, compared with the residents affordability.
7. Aqaba Regional Authority (ARA) :-
- Sites Salahaddin, Shalllah, Old Town & Khazan can be easily served by
transportation .
- Ihe (S&S) site Khazan is attractive for marketing , due to its high and
overlooking location.
- The sites mentioned above are regarded as distinctive examples of complete sites
including all the needed services like : paved roads, sewerage, water, electrcity,
pavements, schools, health community centers , commercial shops, training
centers and a mosque.
- Plots are affordable to inhabitants of Aqaba .
- Some of the sites lackl play grounds and green areas, and in other sites they are
not implemented or maintained.
- More retaining walls are needed in Khazan and Old Town sites .

In the Staff Appraisal Report of the Project, the implementation of UDP3 was
expected to be completed by June 1993. But due to unexpected circumstances
mainly attributed to the Gulf War and its consequences which had a negative
impact on the project's implementation, the completion date was extended to June
1995.
The table above summarises the operatiomn plan for the Project. Completion dates
of sites with community buildings and services, marketing plans, and the
occupation of sites by beneficiaries are the real indicators for the project's
operation. The marketing plan indicates that the last site is to be sold entirely by
Im97. Knowing from previous expenence,that it takes beneficiaries one to two
years to build their own units after the possession of their plots, indicates that real
operation in UDP3 Project will take place in 1999.

The agencies and ministries concerned are willing to take over the responsibilities
of sitesinfrastructure,and social activities for operation and maintennce. It is
agreed hatlhe Housing Bank staff will continue to coordinate with branches that
are assigned to grant loans to beneficiaries ,to ensure that their needs are well
served, their access to loans is eased, and that procedures are kept to the minimum
acceptable norms.
Participation of households in community development programs will take place
gradually, according to the strategy put by HUDC for the community ceuters
operation that is scheduled for five years.
Having all these phases achieved, the end product within four to five years will be
a functioning community, in an imnproved adequate environment, and a better
quality of life.

1- PREFACE
The Jordan Housing Bank (JHB) coitinued its support and commnitn7ent to the National Urban
Housing  Projects which have been implmented in Jordan since the early eighties. This current project
was the third to be executed so far, with an increasing involvement from JHB's side. While JHB acted
only as a financinl arm for Housing  and Urban Development Corporat,on (HUDC) in the first and
second urban projects, its role was extended to appraising the sub projects under the thrd project in
addition to providing construction finance to HUDC for items for which the costs would be recovered
through property sales and, subsequently, provide mortgages to individual houselholds.
The project objectives were set along lines that support the Government's emerging urban policy
aiming at improving living conditions and managiIg urban growth with tlic mphasis on recovemng the
cost of development from project beneficiaries, thus ensuring the replicability of such projects. The,
pxoject included: upgrading of low-income squatter aind slum ateas, land development in new selected
sites, construction of core houses, mortgagl. loans by JHB, social facilities, and'i titutiorAl
development.
In order to ensure that the fiture operation of this project is done in sound and successful manner.
both HIUDC and IHE were askled to prepare a comprehensive operational plan for the project. The
plan aims at maiinng the proposed benefits, easing the access fOr beneficiaires towards attaning
affordable housing units, and ensuring that services are being fully extended to sub projects. The plan is
to include past performance indicators to monitor operattons and development impact, this would help
in planuing for future projects.
The plan to f'ollow is being prepared by JHB, it looks into the opera|ional phase ofthe project
mainly from financial perspective in addition to aspects related to JHB's role in conducting appraisal
studies and monitoring of sub projects wuider UDP3.

2- THE ROLE OF THE JORDAN IIOUSING BAN K
The Jorda,n Housing Baun: iivolvemnent in t1is proJcet lhas been tlaen a step fiirther than was the
case in the previous two urban projects, as it Ivas assigned to appruise the pipeline sub projects in
conjuncron  *virh the Wor;Q Bank (pWB), that is in addition to pro%iding loans to cover project
recoverable costs and extending individual loanm to beneficiaxic.,.
T.h-lB '    fislsing role included the provision of a dixect loan from its own resources totaling ID 9.6
million representing 31% of the overall project cost. The loan is to cover B00. ofland acquisition, 55%
of recoverable civil works-amended to 20% since September/90- and a ceiling of JD 1.67 million to be
granted to project's beneficiaries for building materials purposes. Furthermore, the Loan Agreement
allocated part of WB ,oan to be ordent to JHB channeled through the Govenmnent including: USS 4.2
million tbr granting as building material loans, and USS 10.1 million from housing units sales originally
financed from WB's loan to enable JHB financing project beneficiaLries. According to the iroject
Appraisal Report, JHB would aLso provide aro1ud IJD 7.7 million frorm its own resources as long tan
construction loans for project beneficiaries.               I
The foUowing table shows the updated estimates of disbursement from JHB's direct loan
(Oitginally estimated at JD 9.6 million) covering land and civil works recoverable cost in addition to JD
3.1 million as building material loans (according to HUDC's quarterly report on 31/1V94):

The JHB was assigned as well to cany out the appraisal of sub projects in conjunction with
the   WB . the aim of such process would be to ensure that tie agreed stan(Itrds have been applied in a
techinically sound manner, the costs are reliable, it would be afTordable to 'the target gxoups , and that
sub project would yield an acceptable financial and economnic rate of return. Further, the JHB would
follow up work progress throughl1UDC's reports and on site occasional site visits. This would also be
the case during the marketing phase of the project to ensure that sales are progressing according to the
plans.

The operition plan. as being prepared by the JHB, covers aspects related to its role as a financier of
the project through providing loanis to the HUDC and its heneficiaries. Furtlermiiore, the plan deals as
well with aspects related to JHB's appraisal and monitoring role including a preliminary prograrn for the
operation phase of the project. The 3HB's project ,peration plan is as foUows
3.1 JHB's Loans Programs: 
3.1.1 JHIH's Direct Loan
The JHB's direct loan to HUDC, to cover its own share in 6nancing recoverable. costs, was set at JD
9.6 rmllion as a loan ceiling that should not be exceeded at any time during the projecL This ceiling
includes up to JD. 1.67 miillion to be allocated for project's beneficiaries as building materials loans , the
remairning was to cover 55'o of the recoverable sub projec.s civil works costs and 80% otfland costs.
Later in 1992 JHB's share covering civil works recoverable costs was reduced to 20%, the remairiing
80% was to be covered from the WVB loan proceeds, as an initiative from its own management in
respoond to the economic situation that affected the Countr) in the afternath of the Gulf crisis.
The plan to follow covers JIHB's finance provided to HUDC to cover JHB's share of the civil wqrks
classified wider recoverable iLems, whereas. BMLs are dealt with in lthe next section.,
The following table shows actual amounts financed by JHB to HUDC up to mid lune- 95 excluding
BMLs as well as HUDC's estirmiates for fulture disbursements by JHB to comnplete the project:

recoverable civil works costs, this assumption  is subject to reaclhing anlacceptable agreement with
HUDC  vithout afecting the JH13's rights as set in the Subsidiary Loan Areement . Further., the above
estimation includes J H-B's share in the partial financing of HUDC's adnuiiistrative expenditures during
the future operational phase.
The principal payment of this loan is scheduled to be repaid semi-annually, in mid February and
August of each year commencing from February-1993. Five installment out of twelve have been paid so
far totaling ID 2.49 million. The basis for detennining each installnent depends on loan balance on the
due date divided by number of the remaining I upaid installments. Seven installnents remain to be
repaid totaling JD 7.0 mIllion in addition to hiteres t'accrued which is paid separately.
3.1.2 UDP3 Beneficiaries' Loaus:
The JHB extends loans for 1DP3 beneficiaries for purchasing land and core units, in addition to
building materials loans (BMLs) for the construction or extension of these un,its. The total amount of
BML^s  - considered as part of JHB's direct loan (3.1.1 Ibbove)- is most likely to exceed JD 1.67 million
t representing 55%6 of total loans) as specified in the Subsidiary Loan Agreement. In this cse an
agreement should be reached with the Goverrunent and HU1DC to enable JFtB extend4ing building
niuLerial loans exceeding the above ceiling without atrecting its riglls . In tie ineantitne, louis allocated
by JHB for purchasing land and core urits. are financed from IHB's ow-n resources.       I

APPENDIX B
The J RR's operation plan will consider housing loans under two categories: land & core units Page 29 of 30
purchase loans and building material loans.
3.1.2.1 Land & Usnlt Purchase Loans:
nTe percentage of total sules up to April -95 did not exceed I i % of total UDP3 units and only 21.5%
of units handed over to HUDC representing 476 ot the overall units under UDP3. Sales rate is
expected to rise sharply duing the period until the end of tuhis year as the remaining 53%/O of units will
be completed during this period, and thus wil be ready for marketing.
The following table shows JHB's projections for loans to be extended to HUDC's beneficiaies
during the futujre operation phase of the project:
YEAR                  SALES PROFILE        | TOTAL SALES           LOAN SALES
JUNE-DEC.- 1995                       30%               8,550,000              4,095,000
L996                                  55%Oto           10,725,000             7,507,500
1997                                  15%                 900,000              2.047.500
TOTAL                                 100%              19,500,000 |13,60,000
'Me estinmated sales profile is based upon profles experienced in previous projects, while
percentage of loan sales is assumed to be 70%, of total sales being the average achieved for units sold so
far according to HUDC's marketing reports.
3.1.2.2 Bultdlng Material Loans:
The total estination for building material loans is most likely to exceed prelinminary projectiorns as
incorporated dtuing the appraisal process, this is due to policy change adopted by the HUDC in the dul
course of the projeot reflected in the partial Fancellation of core units that-were proposed to be
constmuted within a31 sub projects.
Based upon the edstirng level ofbuilding mateiial loans intake of JD 550:000 extended up to May-
95, gives rise to 25% being the percentage of building loans to land and core units purchase loans,
The following table shows JHB's projections for building loans duiring the future operational phase
of the project based upon the continuation of existing trends:

APPENDIX B
Page 30 of 30
It follows fromti the above table that estimates for building material loans of ID 4,800,000 wheitadded
to JD 550,000 extended until hMay-95. makles the estimated total amount loans ID 5 350.000 thus
exceeding original estimates of ID 3.1 miillion by ID 2.25 millioi. This as mcntioned in 3.1.2 above
needs to be considered and agreed upon between parties concemed.
The total amotint of building material loans extended by I HB did not exceed so far I0%c  fthe
total estimates, the bulkl is still to come as shown in the above table, this is due to the delay in the
project implementation plan. The closing of WB's loan in 1516195 implies that the I HB cannot withdraw
45% of building material loans extended to project bene&ciaries 15rom  WB's loan proceeds. This
necessitates an agreement to be drawn between JHB and the concemed parties in order to enable JHB
financing  100%  of building material loans from its own resources without its partial dependence on
amounts onlent from WB loan proceeds.
3.2 .2HBs Project Monitoring
The JHB will continue to moonitor work progress in project's sites until the final completion and
handing over and the fiel operation of all infrastucture services. This will be camried out in cordination
with HLDC, through work progrcss reports prepared by siLes supcrvision staft in addition to occasional
site visits by the JHB's statf.
Furthermnore, the JHB will follow-up the markleting process of the proj&ct through thc montWy and
quarterly progress reports in addition to occasional site visits to enstire that markleting is prOgressiz4
accordng to plans prepared by HUDC.       *1.                                  I
The JHBs staff will continue to coordinate with branches that are assigned to grant loans to
ItJDCs benficiaies to ensure that their needs are well served, their arcess to loans is eased, and that
procedures aie kept to the rninmum acceptable nonns.
