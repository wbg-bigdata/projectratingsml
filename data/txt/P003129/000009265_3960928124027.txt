MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE FOR A
PILOT EXTENSION PRCJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Zaire for SDR 4.6 million (US $ 5.9
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would
be on standard IDA terms and would help finance a Pilot Extension Project
to establish a number of pilot extension operations and test management
systems for a larger follow-on project. The project would be co-financed
with the UNDP, which, under Project ZAI/88/006, would grant US $ 4.5
million over a period of five years (1989-1993). Of this grant, about US $
3.0 million would be used during the three-year IDA project period. The
UNDP is using the FAO as its executing agency.
2.        Background.   Zaire's government extension services lack
scientific training and logistic support. Many of the 5,000 poorly
trained, unjsupervised, uncquipped, poorly paid and largely male extension
agents have lost their sense of purpose and are used by local authorities
to impose compulsory planting acreages and cropping practices, to levy
taxes and penalties. As a result, the image of the extension staff is poor
with Zaire's 3.5 million farmers. Some rural development projects, agro-
industries and non-government organizations have developed their own
extension systems because of the Government's declining effectiveness, but
their impact on the rural masses remains limited.
3.        After years of unsuccessful attempts to devise a national
extension policy, the Government of Zaire, the World Bank and UNDP/FAO
agreed to organize a mission to take a fresh look at the issues. The
mission, which visited Zaire in November 1988, recommended to start
preparation immediately by launching pilot extension operations in the
three areas visited (map IBRD 21480): Kikwit (Bandundu), Gemena (Equateur)
and Bumba (Equateur).
4.        Results of the preparatory pilot operations are available and
encouraging. During the 1989 cropping season, farmers established
thousands of adoption plots according to the recommendations of the
extension staff, and achieved considerably higher yields, confirming the
potential for increased production. Farmers and extension agents showed
new, keen interest in interacting to try the improved methods. The
Government, at all levels, is strongly behind the pilot project.



5.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA has been aiding Zaire to
implement a number of sectural programs and Investment projects, as well as
to implement structural adjustment. The Pilot Extension Project would fall
in the area of "0core"* operations that would go ahead even in the absence of
good progress on the adjustment program. This is because the project aims
at directly improving the productivity of small farmove and because
virtually all the production covered is either sold on the open market or
auto-consumed. These farmers would get a good return even in the absence
of good macro-policies. The project would support the Government's move
towards a sustainable country-wide extension service, away from
multifunctional rural development projects. The move calls for the
development of a replicable management system, relying where possible on
the executing capacity of contracted non-government organizetiona, with a
national service to supervise and coordinate the overall system. In
extension, the vorld Bank has wide experience in agricultural extension
projects In many parts of the world, including Africa. Its continuous
involvement, both financial and technical, would help to bring this
international experience to davelop formulas properly adapted to the
various situations prevailing in Zaire.
6.        Prolect Obiectives.  The three-year project would serve to
extend pilet activities to larger areas to test the impact of improved
extension on farmers income and production under a variety of conditions,
and the possibility of improving extension on a large scald in Zaire.
Within three years, the pilot project is designed to open about ten pilot
operations and to benefit about half a million farm families, or 15 X of
the country's rural population. The initial and likely future pilot areas
are shown on map IBRD 21480, appended.
7.        Pro1ect Description.  The project is designed to address the
urgent need for effective agricultural extension, using approaches properly
adapted to Zaire. First, the project would promote general principles of
sound field management to improve the efficiency and harmonize extension
systems used by non-government organizations (NGOs) and the government
field administration. Second, by relying on existing institutions that are
willing to participate, the project would be tailored to local
specificities. Multipurpose NGOs and cotton companies operating along the
lines of the West African "filire" (integrated rural development)
approach, which have indicated their willingness to collaborate, would be
contracted. Thus, rather than relying solely on the government
bureaucracy, the project would be executed wherever possible through
existing local initiatives. Third, the project would support a limited
staff in the National Extension Service (NES) in the Ministry of Rural
Development, Kinshasa, which would s supervise and administer the overall
pilot project; prepare annual work plans and budgets; and prepare a larger
follow-on pruject. The NES would be represented in pilot areas by
extension coordinators, who would prefigure regional coordination units in
the follow-on project, and would supervise field activities.
8.         The project provides funds for transport, equipment and
construction, subsistence and travel compensation, studies, technical
assistance and consultancies. The total cost of the project is estimated
at US $ 10.5 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US $
6.1 million (67%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown



in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements,
and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. The disbursement
schedule is short because the project is designed to be completed in three
instead of the usual five years. A timetable ef key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Zaire are given in
Schedule C and D, respectively. The staff appraisal report No.8166-ZR of
January 23, 1990 is being circulated separately.
9.        Benefits would include : increased farmer income and
productivity; increased agricultural production and domestic food supplies;
and the strengthened capacity of field extension services and non-
government institutions to solve the farmers' technical and the extension
services' implementation problems as they arise. Another benefit would be
the improved capacity of the Ministry of Rural Development to administer
funds and contgacts for the execution of agricultural extension in the
field. Under conservative assumptions, the economic rate of return would
be 22 %.
10.       The project would have a critical impact on the environment, and
on farm women.  The environmental impact would be to train farmers on a
mass scale to improve the management of their agricultural resource base.
The impact on farm women would be to increase their productivity and
alleviate their severe t'me constraints. Studies on ways and means of
increasing the relevance of extension messages to women and of training
more female extension agents are under way.
11.       Risks.  The main risks are the Government's weak administrative
and financial capacity, the lack of farmer's trust in government extension
agents, and the huge size of the country, factors which, added to the lack
of an effective and well understood implementation program, have frustrated
past government efforts to rehabilitate the extension services in a
systematic way, on a country-wide scale, and thereby to implement a key
component of the country's food security policy.
12.       The project is designed to address these risks: key targets are
the development of an effective extension management and training system,
the upgrading of implementing capacities, and the rapid achievement of
convincing results irn the field. While the Government has so far shown
encouraging signs of commitment, the project would test the Government's
capacity to allocate appropriate budget resources in favor of the extension
program.
13.       Other risks include: (a) the country's monetary and financial
stability, which could limit the impact of the project by reducing
agricultural marketing and investment opportunities; and (b) the
performance of other basic services (road maintenance, seed production,
research). These risks are being addressed in the Government's current
macroeconomic and sector policyt with World Bank support.
14.       Agreements Reached.  At negotiations, assurances were obtained
that the project annual work plans and budgets; and the contracts,
including budgets, with the local executing institutions, would be
submitted for IDA's approval. These assurances are included as covenants
in the Credit Agreement.
