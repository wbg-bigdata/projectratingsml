Credit and Pro1ect Sum g
Borrower:      Government of Zaire
Amount:        SDR 4.6 million (US$ 5.9 million)
Termst         Standard IDA - forty years.
Pro1ect
Descriitions   (i) Obiectives and Content.  The Project would serve as a
three-year pilot to test the impact of improved extension
on farmers income and production, and the possibility of
improving extension on a large scale in Zaire. The pilot
would consist ofs
(a) strengthened management of extension
services;
(b) training of extension staff;
(e) adaptive research;
(d) the establishment of monitoring and
evaluation units; and
(e) studies.
(ii) Benefits would include: increased
farmer income and productivity; increased
agricultural production and domestic food
supplies; and improved efficiency of field
extension services.
(iii) Risks. The main risks are the
Government's I-eak finaneial and
administrative capacity, the lack of farmers
trust in the existing extension service, and
the huge size of the country, factors which,
added to the lack of an effective and well
understood implementation program, have
frustrated the Government's efforts to
rehabilitate the extension services in a
systematic way, on a country-wide scale, and
thereby to implement a key component of the
country's food security policy.

PILOT EXTENSION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
A. Pro1 ct Backaround
1.01      Zaire'e government extension services lack scientific training
and logistic support. Many of the 5,000 poorly trained, unsupervised,
unequipped, poorly paid and largely male extension agents have lost their
sense of purpose and are used by local authorities to impose compulsory
planting and cropping practices, to levy taxes and penalties. As a result,
the image of the extension staff is poor with farmers. Some rural
development projects, agro-industries and non-government organizations have
developed their own extension systems because of the Government's declining
effectiveness, but their impact on the overall rural population remains
limited.
1.02      After years of unsuccessful attempts to devise a national
extension policy, the Government of Zaire, IDA and UNDP/FAO agreed to
organize a mission to take a fresh look at the issues. The mission, which
visited Zaire in November 1988, recommended to start work imwediately on a
pilot basis in three areast Kikwit, Gemena, and Bumba (map IBRD 21480).
With assistance from IDA, the Government organized induction seminars in
the three areas early in 1989. By March 1989, the UNDP had granted a
preparatory advance and IDA a Project Preparation Facility, while the
Government increased its 1989 budget allocation to extension, from 50
million zaires ($130,000) to 192 million zaires ($480,000). One
intermediate objective of the pilot initiative was to establish a large
number of adoption plots to try new techniques under farm conditions, and
thereby to show that extension services could be operative.
1.03      Results of the pilot activities are now available and
encouraging. During the cropping season, farmers established thousands of
adoption plots according to the recomuendations of the extension staff, and
achieved considerably higher yield&, confirming the potential for increased
production. Farmers and extension agents showed new, keen interest in
interacting to try the Improved methods. The Government, at all levels, is
strongly behind the pilot initiative.
B. The Aaricultur Sector
General.
1.04      Zaire is one of the richest countries in Africa in terms of its
land, forestry, water and natural resources, not to mention its vast wealth
of minerals and energy sources. The country extends over a vast territory
of about 2.3 million sq km (230 million ha), of whi.ch about 80 million ha,
or 35 percent, is thought to be suitable for agriculture. Whereas only 10



million ha, or lese than 15 percent, Is under direct cultivation or
grazing, much larger but usmeasured areas are In fact used for extended
fallow  In alash-and-burn system  of cultivation. The country's rapidly
growing population exceeda 30 million, making It the fourth most populous
country in Africa, after Nigeria, Ethiopia and Egypt. But overall, the
land is sparsely and unovenly populated, as shown in the appended maps.
Poor rural infrastructure and Isolation have driven many people, an
estimated forty percent of the population (1985), to live In urban areas.
1.05      Agriculture is by far the most Important sector In the economy,
providing diroct and indirect employment to about 82 percent of the active
population. It has been estimted that there are about 3.5 million farm
families In Zaire. However, agriculture contributes only 31 percent of GDP
(1988) and 8 percent (1985) of export earnings. Rural per capita Incooe is
very low, in the order of US $ 95 in 1987, according to official data.
1.06      At least eighty percent of farmers in Zaire are traditional
smallholdere, who practice slash-and-burn techniques, with about 0 7 he
under cultivation. The lack of extension, inputs and research Is known to
be a major impediment to Increased yields. The gap between actual and
potential farm yields, under present conditions, is summarized In the
following table.
Table 1
Malor Fooderop Yields
(tons per hectare)
1987       On-farm Potential
Maize                      0.8            1.5-3.5
Cassava (tubers)           7.0            12-15
Rice                       0.5           0.8-1.5
Beans                      0.6           0.8-1.5
Groundnuts (shelled)       0.5           0.8-1.0
Palm Oil                   1.4             3-4
Banana                     3 .7           10-20
(source s Agriculture Sector Memorandum, World Bank staff estimates.)
Trials in the three initial pilot areas in 1989 indicated that a
significant part of the gap between actual and potential yields could be
closed just by improving cultural practices. In addition, marketing is
often problematic, due to long distances and to the lack of good roads and
river transport, vehicles and credit.
1.07      These constraints, added to the proximity of the International
borders to the main cities, Kinshasa and Lubumbashi, and to the attractive,
sometimes subsidized prices of Imports, explains the large amount of food
imports which, in 1987, totalled $207 million, or about 16S of the
country's total Import bill. The main food imports are wheat, maize, rice,
meat (beef and poultry), fish, and sugar. Of these products, maize and
rice are important smallhoder crops, as well as cassava, groundnuts and
pulses, which are also staple food items.



-3-
1.10      Aside from food crops, coffee ad cotton are two important
mallbolder crops. Coffe  Is Important because it is the major
agricultural export and is grown by about 350,000 mallholders. But the  -
quality of Zairian coffee on the International market s generally very
poor. There Is scope for Increasing both quality and yields of cost".
1.09      For many of the 140,000 cotton growers, cotton Is the only cash
crop available. Four major cotton companies run the ginning factories and
provide agricultural services to cotton growers, Including extension,
inputs, credit and marketing, a well as the maintenance of rural roads.
Much like the cotton companies In Wat Africa, they apply the OfliI&re, or
Integrated approach to rural development. In Zaire, ylelds of cotton are
low for several reaons of which weak extension is one. Others are the
lack of foreign exchange (to procure inputs, lncluding pesticides), lack of
credit, and poor prices. Initiatives to Improve the management of the
cotton companies and -o pay attractive prices to farmers are under way.
1.10      Thore has been little agricultural research In Zaire since
independence (1960).  Same commodity-specifi'e progrms have roceived
support from bilateral donors, such as the United States (cassava, maize
and legume.), Belgium (cotton, fruit trees), and France (livestock and
cotton). Private companies and non-government organizations have continued
sporadic research initiatives. Seed farms (map 21545) genorally carry out
adaptive research as well as seed production. Under the National Research
Program, a sytem is being prepared to coordinate rosearch nationally, to
set priorities among and within research programs, to streamline INERA
(Institut National pour la Recherehe et l'Etude 4gronomiques, the national
research institute) and to allocate resources in a rational manner.
1.11      In the more populated parts of the country-side, fallows are
shrinking as the rural population inreaseso, and declining soil fertility
has become a major concern. Decreasing yields have led farmers to deplete
the rain and gallery forests at- a disquieting pace.  80  two million
hectares are annually cleared in search of more fertile soils.
1.12      Women are key decision-makers on many farms.  They are almost
solely :esponsible for certain crops (cassava), livestock (poultry) and
tasks (harvesting, storago, processiag, transport). They provide the bulk
of labor in the smallholder agriculture sector. Women's labor Is In such
high demand In the household and on the farm that, In some cases, they have
time to prepare but one meal each day. This Is an Important causoe of the
serious problem of child malnutrition in rural areas.
1 13      There are several government ministries involved In the
agriculture sector. Extension is the responsibility of the National
Extension Service, Ministry of Rural Development. The Ministry of
Agriculture Is responsible for livestock, crops and agricultural
statistics. Forestry and onvironment fall under a third ministry (Ministry
of Land and Environment), while agricultural research is under the
responsibility of INERA, which reports to a fourth Ministryt Higher
Education and Research.

C. Recent Policles and Performance
1.14      Since December 1988, the Government has taken a number of
measures to restore the Structural Adjustment Program launched in 1987.
Agreement was reached on a macro-economic framework for 1989-91. In May
1989, IDA released the second tranche of the Structural Adjustment Credit
(Cr. 1831-ZR). Discussions are underway to up-date the macro-economic
framework. The proposed Pilot Extension Project falls in the area of
'core lending operations that would go ahead even in the absence of good
progress on the adjustment program. This is because the project aims at
directly Improving the productivity of small farmers end because virtually
all the production covered is either sold on the open market or u*uto-
consumed. These farmers would get a good return even in the absence of
good macro-policies.
D. Bank Group Involvement In Agriculture. 2/
1.15      In the agriculture sector, IDA has lent for two major types of
operations : first, for projects which provided long and short term credit
for specific coumoditios, notably sugar, cotton and oil palm; and second,
for rural development, foodcrop ond livestock development projects.  In the
first case, the Impact of projects was lImited by unstable monetary and
financial markets, which caused th. rapid devaluation of the Zairian
currency, and increased the financial risk of traders and investors. In
the second cases projects were designed on the underlying assumption that
the exiqt±ng Zairian administration was too weak to respond to management
demands. The result was a series of free-standing enclave projects
pursuing multiple rural development objectives with financal autonomy and
a government management structure outside the permanent administration of
the Ministries of Agriculture Lnd Rural Development. Though during the
initial investment period, sei:rz1 of these projects have been relatively
successful, their fundamental shorocomangs were the same as that of many
integrated rural development projects in Africat the projects were too
complex to manage, were executed with substantial expatriate support, and
proved difficult to sustaiu and to expand. The Government favors
sustainable country-wide interventions, based on national govermment
services and on the executing capacity of non-government organizations
where available.
1.16      The strategy of IDA is now emphasizing the need to rehabilitate
basic agricultural services. Five main projects have been or are being
launched according to this stratogyt the Seeds Project (Cr.1609-ZR), which
is developing a national network of privately managed seed farms (map IBRD
21545); (Ui) the proposed Pilot Extension Project (which would serve to
prepare a larger follow-on Extension Project); (iti) a rural roads
technical assistance project financed by UNDP (ZAI/861005), with the Worid
Bank as the executing agency, designed to stren_ ;hen the management of
2/Agriculture Sector Memorandum (Report No. 7356-ZR, September 26, 1988)



W5s 
rural road.t (iv) a National Research Project, under preparation; and (v) a
Natural Resources Conservation Project, also under preparation. In
addition, the Agricultural Sector Management and Institutional Dovelopment
Project (Cr.1958-ZR) Is designed to strengthen the Government's sector
policy analysis and lmplementation capacity, In particular to address the
issue of rationallzing the sectoral administration and improving the
compensation of governmont employees. Projects under preparation will
address and help put in place the broad policy framework for (i) rural
credit; (i1) resource mangement and environmental protection; and (iii)
lproving the living and working conditions of women.
E.  Rationale for IDA Involvent
1 17      As a complement to the adjustment program, the World Bak wishes
to support the Government's drive towards a sustainable country-wide
extension service designed to ssist non-government organizations and the
government's fild administration in harmonizing and Improving their
approaches to extension. The World Bank's experience in agricultural
extension in many parts of the world and in Africa, using in particular the
principles of the utraining and visit' system of management, would help to
develop formulas properly adapted to the various situations prevailLng in
Zaire.
II. PIIOT AREAS
2.01      The pilot project waa prepared during the 1989 cropping season
in three initial pilot areas (Kikwit, Gemena and Bumba). Under the pilot
project, pilot extension activities would be extended to othor areas of
economic Importance, to test extension systems in a variety of human and
agro-ecological conditions. Likely pilot areas to be developed under the
project are shown on map IBRD 21480, appended, and include Kananga, Mbuji-
Mayi and Kabinda. Maize, cassava, rice and groundnuts are the main food
crops to be covered under the pilot project, cotton and coffee the main
cash crops.
2.02      In most areas, existing entities such as cotton companies and,
around Gemens and Bumbs, the Centre de Developpement Integral of Bwamanda,
or CDI-Bwamanda, a large non-profit organization hilch is successfully
undertaking integrated rural development, are eager to contribute to the
project. Entities such as these, provided their own resources to
participate in the initial pilot operations. In the areas of Kikwit,
Kananga and Mbuji-Mayi, the pilot project would take-over the extension
components of earlier Bank-financed rural development projects, either
recently completed or nearing completion (Cr.1152-ZR, Cr.1540-ZR and
Cr.1040-ZR).

Ill.  TEzMnmO
A. Content
3.01      The project is designed to address the urgent need for effective
agricultural extension, testing approaches adopted to Zaire, based on throe
features. Viret, the project would promote general principles of sound
fi%bd management to improve the efficiency and harmnalse extension systems
used by non-government organizations (NGOs) and the government field
administration. Second, by relying on existing Institutions that are
willing to participate, the project would be tailored to local
specificities. Multipurpose NGOs and cotton companles operating along the
lines of the West African "fIl11re' apprach, which have lndicated their
willingness to collaborate, would be contracted. Thus, rather than relying
solely on the government bureaucracy, the project would be executed
wherever possible through existing local private initiatives. Third, the
project would support a limited staff in the National Extension Service
(NES) in the Ministry of Rural Development, Kinshaoa, which would supervise
and administer the overall pilot project, and prepare a larger follow-on
project. The NES would be represented in pilot are"s by extension
coordinators, who woiild prefigure regional coordination units in the
follow-on project. The coordinators would supervise the daily operation of
field activities.
3.02      The project is expected to cover half a million farm families,
or 152 of the total farming population of Zaire. The scope of the pilot
project is in relation to the sixe of Zaire and to the variety of human and
agricultural situations existing on the vast territory of the country.
3.03      The project wmould be implemented over a three year period and
would include the following componentst a) strengthened management. of
extension services; b) training of extension staff; c) adap:ive research;
d) the establishment of monitoring and evaluation systems; and e) studies.
Strengthened massgneot would be primarily deslgned to support extension
agents in their schedule of regular visits to active and representative
farmer groups, selected for their ability to spread agricultural knowhow to
the entire farm population under each agent's responsibility. For each
position in the extension service, specifically defined schedules and
responsibilities would aim at intensified field supervision and recycling
of extension agents; increased exposure of subject matter specialists to
farmers, experiment stations and extension agents; and regular information
of the research establishment on farmer's adoption of technology.
Expenditures would Include transport (bicycles, motorcycles and vehicles);
field equipment for the extension staff; office furniture, equipment and
construction; consultancies; and field allowances for travel and
subsistence in the field. A satisfactory field allownmce scheme,
applicable to all pilot areas, was agreed during appraisal.
3.04      Training would include induction seminars, regular training of
extension agents, monthly seminars for sv    - matter specialists, visits
to experiment sites, and study tours, inside and outside the country. Safe
pesticide handling for users and distributors of pesticides would be one of
the training subjects. Training would continuously increase technical



knowledge, Improve diagnostic skills and the capacity of the extension
staff to share ideas with farmer and researchers. Training In financial
manageent would also be lncluded. Expenditures would include transport,
anterials and equipment, consultancies and compensation.
3.05      Adaptive rsearch would tailor broad-based existing
recommendations to the local environment. Local Institutions such a  seed
farms, non-government organisations and research stations would develop
adaptive research programs, carry out field diagnoses, establish the
xperimental plots, end analyse experimental results. Local adaptive
resoeareh progrms would be key Inputs Into INERA's own progrmding.
Expenditures would include transport, research materials and equipment,
construction, consultancies, labor and compensation.
3.06      Nomitoring and evaluation units In each pilot operation would
collect and process data from samples of the farm population to determine
the adoption and Impact of extension recommendations. Expenditures would
include transport, measurement devices, field compensation, stationoery,
small data processing equipmedt and consultancies.
3.07      The Government would carry out studies to prepare the larger
follow-on project, drawing on the evaluction of the pilot operations, using
local and foreign experts. Studies would use the experience of the pilot
project to assess i (a) the impact of improved extension ons farmers
income; the welfare of the rural population, including women and children;
agricultural production and the management of the agricultural resource
base; (b) government capacity to implement and coordinate extension
services on a large scalel and (c) costs and financial sustainability,
including government financial comnitment.  Resources for audits, for other
studies, including the economic viability and *cological impacts of
pesticide use, studies on women issues, and broader studies to improve
rural development policies, would also be included In this component.
3.08      The National Extension Service (NES) would contract the
execution of pllot activities to local entities, and, in the absence of
such entities, would organise and support the government field services. A
model execution contract, appended (Annex 6), provides for an annual budget
and requires the entities to facilitate supervision; to keep accounts; and
to have their accornts audited by an acceptable auditor. In accordance
with the government budget timetable, the NES would draw up annal work
programs, including t an assessment of past achievements, the number of
farmers covered, and costsg objectives and an implementatio sochedule
(including projected new pilot operations); a budget proposal with sources
of finance, and estimates of expenditure for the next three years; a list
of contracts; procurement, consultancies and training plans. The annual
work programs would be submitted to IDA for comment, by August each year.
By March, the NES would produce its annual report. Within the Government,
the activities of the NES would be reviewed by a Comite d'orientation,
grouping representatives of various ministries (see organigram). Key
positions, including the director of extension in Kinahasa, his three
division chiefs (extension, adaptive research and administration-and-
finance) and the extension coordinators have been filled in consultation
with IDA.



3.09      To address the needs of farmers as they vary In place and time,
subject matter specialists would continuously develop technIcal messages
through constant diagnoses of evolving farming practices; discussion with
farmers, extension agents and researchers; and data from the monitoring and
evaluation units. Technical messages would, in the beginning, concentrate
on simple, low cost, low risk farming practices common In each area, which
have been proved to yield good results, or to save work. Optimal plant
density would be a central theme, involving messages on date of planting,
spacing of sooes, depth of sowing, number of seeds per hole, arrangements
for mixed cropping, choice of and conservation of seed, and possibly seed
germination tests. Agricultural resource management is another priority
theme, with a variety of possible messages to develop and extend,
including: crop rotations and associations with legume crops, relay
cropping and weed management for continuous land cover, integration of
livestock and cropping, agroforestry, composting of crop and weed residues
and livestock manure, contour planting and bunding and use of Vetiver or
other soil-fixing grasses. rhere are many themes to develop for livestock,
including animal nutrition, simple animal health messures, and recycling
manure. Extendable technology is thus amply available, especially for the
early stages of the project, and would be reviewed locally before each
cropping season, in conjunction with the adaptive research agenda for the
season. Such review have been successfully tested In the Initial pilot
areas.
B. Costs
3.10      The total cost of the three-year pilot project is estimated at
US $ 10.5 mil-lion equivalent. Project Costs can be summarised -s follows:

More details are in Annox 5. Overall, the project would involve
about 1,300 oxtension staff. It would provide transport, extension,
training and office equipmentg and incremental operational needs.
Technical assistance and consultancies would be mostly financed as a grant
by UNDP. There are no physical contingencies. Project costs expressed in
US dollars are based on constant purchasing parity exchange rates (exchange
rates that vary to compensate exactly for the different inflation rates),
using the following contingenciess

C. Financing
3.11      The financing of the project costs, including taxes and dutios,
would be as follows:
Z bill.    US$ mill.    2
IDA                                    3.4         5.9       56 2

TOTAL                                  6.1        10.5      100 2
The proposed forty year IDA Credit of US $ 5 9 million would be
subject to standard terms and conditions. The UNDP would commit US$ 4.5
million over a five-year period in the form of a grant to meet expenditures
for technical assistance, training and some equipment. Of this amount, US
$ 3.0 million, Including the Preparatory Advance, would be disbursed over
the three-year period of this project.  The UNDP has designated FAO as its
executing agency. To avoid delays, and becase IDA funds could substitute,
at least in the beginning, for essential expenditures, effectiveness of the
IDA Credit would not be dependent on the UNDP grant.
3.12      Finances for extension would be managed centrally by the
National Extension Service (NES), through its administration and finance
division (organigram). The NES would draw from its e1location in the
government's investment budget and from the IDA credit, while the FAO's
Principal Technical Advisor would draw on UNDP funds. The annual work
program of the NES, discussed earlier, would be prepared consistently with
government budget procedures. Contracts with non-government organizations
would require annual budget estimates and disbursement schedules.
D. Disbursements
3.13      Disbursements from the Credit would be made on the basis of the
following tables

---                       Total           C.9
The disbursement profile in Annex 1 is shorter than usual
because the pilot project is designed for three years instead of the usual
five. All disbursements would be fully documented except for contracts
under $ 20,000, for which payments would be made against statements of
expenditure. Documentation of the statements of expenditure would be
available for review by IDA supervision missions and independent auditors.
3.14      The Government has opened a Special Account (in foreign
exchange) for the pilot extension project in a commercial bank to expedite
disbursements with torms and conditions of vperations acceptable to IDA.
Upon credit effectiveness and receipt of a withdrawal application, the
Association would make an advance deposit of up to US $ 250,000 ln the
Special Account, corresponding to four months' expenditure. The Special
Account would be replenished upon receipt and approval of satisfactory
documented evidence of expenditure to be provided by the project
administrators. Should any disbursements be made from the Special Account
that are not acceptable to IDA, the Government would deposit the
corresponding amount In the Special Account.
F. Procurement
3.15      Methods of procurement for project services and goods are
summarized in Annex 2.  Services - World Bank guidelines for selection and
recruitment would apply to consultants financed by IDA, Including audit
firms. Most consultants, however, would be recruited by the FAO, using
UNDP funds. Goods - Under the proposed project, procurement would use
international competitive bidding, as described In the World Bank
guidelines, for vehicles and equipment grouped in lots equal to or more
than US $ 70,000. To the extent possible, items would be grouped for
bidding to encourage competition. Vehicles, motorcycles, bicycles and
furniture In lots costing less than US $ 70,000 and not exceeding an
aggregate amount of US $ 300,000 would be acquired through local shopping
(at least three quotations required). Local shopping is also used In the
start-up phase (PPF financing) for reasons of urgency. The threshold
beyond which the Borrower would be required to submit procurement documents
to the World Bank for prior review would be $ 70,000.



- 11 -
F. Akcounts and Audits
3.16      The National Extension Service would keep separate accounts for
all expenditures budgeted under the pilot project, using the Plan Comptable
G;inral Zairois. Contracted executing entities would be required to do the
same. The accounts and statements of expenditure would be audited each
year by external auditors acceptable to IDU and submitted to IDA no later
than six months after the close of the financial year. Contracts with
executing entities would provide that the executing entity would have its
accounts audited by an acceptable auditor. Agreements to this effect were
obtained at negotiations.
IV. BNMTS AND RIMS
A. Benefits
4.01      The project Is expected to show that significant gains in
farmers' income and welfare, and in agricultural production cmn be obtained
through Improved management of extension and adaptive research, nd that
these Improvements are possible on a large scale. As mentioned earlier,
there is considerable scope for adopting available and sitple technology
improvements on the farm in Zaire. This would lead to increased incomes
for the rural population, and to increased production of fooderops,
Uhich are Important elements of the country's policy for food security.
S. snvironmental Imact
4.02      Through its emphasis on the management of the agricultural
resource base, the proposed project alms at developing sustainable farming
practices. The situation has evolved in many places to a point whero
farmors' interests and that of protecting the environment are now the same.
Trials to determine cost-effectiveness of pesticide use are ongoing and
will continue under the project, as well as extension on safe and effective
pesticide use. Any use of pesticides in the project will be consistent
with World Bank guidelines. The proposed project would thus pursue an
environmentally sound management of the agricultural resource base, leaving
the broader issues of Zaire's unique forest and biodiversity to upcoming
operations.
C. Im*act on Wbmen
4.03      Well defined strategies are necessary to effectively reach
women, both in terms of the delivery approach and of relevant messages. As
far as delivery is concerned, studies are under way to recruit and train
more female extension agents. In the meantime, the number and form of
contacts between the extension staff and women would be closely monitored
under the pilot project. For example, traditional women's groups, common
throughout Zaire, could prove an effective extension contact. In terms of
relevant messag e, women's crop and livestock responsibilities would be
explicitly identified and subject matter specialists would be trained in
domains of particular importance to women, such as post-harvest
technologies. The studies component of the proposed project would provide
resources for studying the welfare of women in agriculture. The expected



- 12 -
impact would be an increase in the agricultural productivity of rural
women, which would alleviate their severe time constraint, and would
contribute to improve child care and nutrition.
D. Economic Rate of Return
4.04      Attributing a precise level of benefits to extension and
research is difficult as the nature and timing of scientific advances are
unpredictable and it is not possible to accurately single out the
proportion of benefits deriving from extension and adaptive research alone.
It is the combination of a number of factors such as price policies, the
availability and cost of inputs, credit, and climatic conditions that
brings the desired benefits, with extension playing the role of catalyst.
Nevertheless, a recent review of studies that have attempted to measure the
impact of agricultural extension programs on farmer adoption and
productivity concluded that agricultural extension in a number of countries
has been a high pay-off investment. Based on the available messages
(proper spacing, plant population and timely weeding) which are being
proposed to farmers, the Impact to be achieved through the extension
components has been estimated In the form of an economic rate of return.
4.05      The economic analysis (Annex 3) is based on conservative
assumptions, including only moderate increases in yields resulting from
extension, and an adoption rate by which the farming area cropped using new
technology would gradually increase to 35 2 of the farming area under the
project in 1994. Under these assumptions, the economic rate of return
would be 22 Z. Results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in Annex 3.
C. Budaet Implications
4.06      The Cost Analysis appearing in Annex 4 shows that annual costs
of extension, based on a ratio of 400 farm families per extension agent,
would amount to $ 6.41 per farm family per annum (about $1.00 per capita),
including operation as well as depreciation costs (but excluding the cost
of technical assistance, unlikely to be borne beyond the pilot phase). On
that basis, which is reasonable by international standards, the annual cost
would be $ 3.4 million for the 532,000 farmers under the pilot project, and
$ 22 million for the 3.5 million farmers in the whole of Zaire.
4.07      Comparatively, the Government contribution for the extension
program In the budget of the Ministry of Rural Development was less than
$0.5 million in 1989. However, in that year, the agriculture sector
received only about $ 25 million, or less than 3 2 of the total budget,
almost half of which was absorbed by the external debt service. The
results of the pilot project are expected to confirm the need to allocate
more resources to the agriculture se:tor. Rationalizing public expenditure
is a central concern of our macro-economic dialogue. Among the issues
under discussion are the structure of expenditures and the normalization of
sustained funding of operating expenditures, such as extension activities,
on the recurrent budget. Macro-economic and sector-wide instruments such
as the Structucal Adjustment Program (Cr.1831-ZR) and the Agricultural
Sector Management and Institutional Development Project (Cr.1958-ZR) are
deemed more appropriate than the proposed pilot project for addressing



- 13 -
budget issues which affect many government activities. Nevertheless, by
providing evidence of the impact of extension in the field, the pilot
project to designed to facilitate government decisions in favor of
reallocating funds for extension.
F. Risks
4.08      The main risks are the Government's weak administrative and
financial capacity, the lack of farmers' trust in government extension
agents, and the huge size of the country, factors which, added to the lack
of an effective and well understood Implementation program, have frustrated
past Government efforts to rehabilitate the extension services in a
systematic way and thereby to implement a key component of the country's
food security policy. The pragmatic yet systematic approach of the
proposed pilot project is designed to address these risks. Other risks
include: (a) the country's monetary and financial stability, which could
affect the impact of the project by reducing agricultural marketing and
investment opportunities; and (b) the performance of other basic services
(road maintenance, seed production, research). These risks are being
addressed in the Government's current macroeconomic and sector policy, with
World Bank support.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED
5.01      At negotiations, assurances were obtained that the annual work
plans (para 3.08) and contracts, including budgets, with the local
executing agencies (pars 3.09), would be submitted and must be satisfactory
to IDA. The annual work plan for 1990; a model contract with local
executing agencies (Annex 6); and the appointments for key positions (para
3.08) were reviewed at negotiations and are satisfactory. Agreements were
also reached on accounting and auditing, as stated above (para 3.16).
5.02      The proposed project would be suitable for an IDA credit of SDR
4.6 million (US$ 5.9 million) to the Government of Zaire.
