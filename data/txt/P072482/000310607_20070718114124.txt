1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)
At appraisal in December 2000, Uganda was considered to be one of the few countries in Africa
that had made progress in reversing the HIV/AIDS epidemic. There was an overall decline in the
HIV prevalence rate, from 18.5% in the early 1990s to 8% in 1999. The level of HIV awareness
was high - over 90% in the general population. The median age at first sexual contact had
increased by two years among youth. Other behavior indicators also improved, including a
reduction in the numbers of non-regular sexual partners, particularly for the non-married.

Despite these successes, Uganda remained one of the worst affected countries by HIV/AIDS.
HIV prevalence was unacceptably high at 8% in the adult population. Since the onset of the
epidemic, about 2.2 million people had been infected, 800,000 had died, and over 1.1 million
children had been orphaned. AIDS was the leading cause of adult mortality and responsible for
12% of annual deaths. The socioeconomic consequences of HIV/AIDS have devastated every
aspect of national development, imposing a mounting burden on households, communities and
the society. The extent of behavioral change was still limited compared to the level of awareness.
The services for Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT), sexually transmitted infections (STI)
treatment, and provision of condoms remained largely in urban areas, leaving rural areas under-
served. Orphans and households affected by HIV/AIDS needed care and social support. Although
12 line ministries were already implementing HIV/AIDS control, the activities needed to be
strengthened and expanded to under-served areas. The challenge was to build capacity in all
sectors and institutions to respond to the epidemic in a coordinated manner.

Uganda's response had been characterized by a broad partnership with all stakeholders. The
government adopted a multi-sector approach to the control of HIV/AIDS in 1992 and established
the Uganda AIDS Commission (UAC) by an Act of Parliament. Other efforts to mobilize and
unify the national HIV/AIDS response included the establishment of (i) 12 AIDS Control
Programs in line ministries and (ii) District AIDS Coordination Committees.

In the Poverty Eradication Action Plan, HIV/AIDS control was a priority; and all line ministries,
districts and organizations were expected to mainstream HIV/AIDS activities. The National
Strategic Framework (NSF) 2000/1-2005/6, built upon the previous AIDS plans, used existing
institutions and implementation arrangements and placed HIV/AIDS in the broader context of
social and economic development. It called for greater emphasis on community implementation,
improved integration and cross-sector collaboration, encouraging wider stakeholder participation
and more effective interventions. It aimed to:
      a) Consolidate the prevention of transmission of HIV and sexually transmitted infections;
      b) Promote integration of HIV/AIDS interventions into sexual and reproductive health;
      c) Mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS on people affected and infected;
      d) Address the economic, social and cultural impact of HIV/AIDS; and
      e) Strengthen national capacity at all levels to respond to the epidemic with increased
           emphasis on the community.

In this context, in 2000, the Government of Uganda requested IDA support for the Uganda
HIV/AIDS Control Project (UACP) as part of the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program (MAP) for




                                                                                                1

the Africa Region, which started in the same year. UACP was in the first cohort of MAP projects
and the only major source of external funding for HIV/AIDS in Uganda at the time.

Rationale for Bank assistance:
One of the objectives of the 2002 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was to help Uganda
improve the quality of life of the poor through increased access to basic services such as health
care, clean water and quality primary education. For health, its assistance would include a
HIV/AIDS Control Project to support Uganda's efforts in combating the epidemic. Thus the
project was in line with the CAS.

According to the PAD, Bank assistance to Uganda in HIV/AIDS was to add values in terms of:
       a) Knowledge and lessons learned from international experience in HIV/AIDS programs;
       b) IDA's international experience in the implementation of social funds and in targeted
            cash transfers which can be applied to community-led HIV/AIDS initiatives and
            targeted support for orphans; and
       c) A catalyst for additional resources and technical assistance from the international
            community.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The project supports the Government of Uganda's National Strategic Framework for HIV/AIDS
(NSF) which aims to: (a) reduce the spread of HIV infection; (b) mitigate the health and
socioeconomic impact of HIV/AIDS at individual, household and community levels; and (c)
strengthen the national capacity to respond to the epidemic.

Key indicators:

    1. By 2006, reduce from 49% to under 40% the proportion of 15-19 year old boys and girls
         that are sexually active.
    2. By 2006, reduce from 14% to 10% the proportion of sexually active people reporting
         non-regular sexual partners.
    3. By 2006, reduce from 15% to 5% the rate of reported sexually transmitted (urethritis)
         infections in men aged 15-49 in the last 12 months.
    4. By 2006, reduce by 30 % the drop-out rate of orphaned children in primary school.
    5. By 2006, increase from 30% to 50 % the proportion of men/women aged 15-49 who
         report using a condom in their last act of sexual intercourse with a non-regular partner.
    6. By 2006, reduce HIV prevalence from 9% to below 6% among women attending prenatal
         care services.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators (as approved by original approving authority), and
reasons/justification
There was no revision to the PDO. At Mid-term Review (MTR), on the basis of better data
available through the Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) and the Lots Quality
Assurance Sampling (LQAS) survey, the key project indicators and their targets were fine-tuned
as follows1:




1Please see Annex 2 for the full list of the revised project indicators. It should be noted that (i) the revision
of project indicators did not go through formal approval procedures, and (ii) the Project Implementation
Status and Results (ISR) Reports continued to use the original indicators.


                                                                                                                2

    1. By end of 2006, increase the proportion of sexually active persons who report using a
        condom the last sexual act with a non-regular partner increases from 3.5% to 20% for
        female (15-49) and 42% to 60% for men (15-54).
    2. By the end of 2006, reduce the proportion of 15-24 years old who report sex with non-
        regular partner in past 12 months from 30.2% to less than 20%.
    3. By end of 2006, reduce the proportion of reported STIs in men aged 15-54 years in last
        12 months from 18.8% to 10%.
    4. By 2006, reduce HIV prevalence below 6% among women of childbearing age attending
        antenatal care (ANC).
    5. By end of 2006, increase the proportion of orphans attending school 5 days in the
        preceding week from 71.6 % to 80 %.
    6. By the end of 2006, increase the proportion of PLWHAs identified by CSOs that are
        receiving some form of psychosocial support to 90%.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)
    a) Groups that are known to be particularly vulnerable to HIV infection such as young
        people (in particular teenage girls), pregnant women, long distance truck drivers, road
        and power construction workers, traders, fishermen, the military, and the prison
        population;
    b) Groups which engage in high risk HIV-related behaviors, such as commercial sex
        workers and their clients, men who have sex with men and intra-venous drug users;
    c) Key sectors affected by AIDS such as agriculture, industries, road construction, power
        and energy, and
    d) Impoverished orphans and HIV-striken households, with a focus on those headed by
        women, elderly and youths

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
Component 1: Nationally Coordinated Initiatives (US$25 million, 50% of total project costs)
This component would support HIV/AIDS control activities coordinated by the Uganda AIDS
Commission and directly carried out by different line ministries or central government agencies,
or contracted out to civil society organizations or the private sector. At appraisal, IDA agreed
with the government on the specific actions plans for the first year of project implementation, to
scale up and mainstream HIV/AIDS activities in the:
    a) Uganda AIDS Commission;
    b) Ministry of Health;
    c) Ministry of Education and Sports;
    d) Ministry of Gender, Labor and Social Development;
    e) Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries;
    f) Ministry of Works, Housing and Communications;
    g) Ministry of Defense;
    h) Ministry of Internal Affairs;




                                                                                                3

    i) Ministry of Local Government;
    j) Ministry of Public Service;
    k) Ministry of Justice; and
    1) Other ministries.

Other ministries would be assisted to draft their respective HIV/AIDS action plans during the first
year of project implementation. Each line ministry's work plan would include HIV/AIDS
prevention and mitigation activities for its staff as well as for the public that it directly serves.
Many of these activities would be contracted at national level but would be directly benefit
districts and communities. For example, diagnostic kits and pharmaceuticals would be financed
under this component but would mostly benefit district based health services.

Component 2: District Initiatives (US$ 10 million,20% of total project costs).
This component would support activities to be directly carried out by district authorities, or
contracted out to civil society organizations or to the private sector, including activities to:
    a) Raise awareness of district leadership, teachers, school management teams and
         community leaders;
    b) Train and support district- and community-based staff and leaders, including teachers,
         home-care givers and counselors, traditional healers and traditional birth attendants, and
         rural extension workers;
    c) Provide HIV/AIDS related health promotion and prevention services at all district
         hospitals and clinics;
    d) Provide HIV/AIDS related diagnosis, treatment and care at referral district hospitals;
    e) Promote community-led and civil society-led HIV/AIDS initiatives and manage the
         respective selection, contracting, financing and supervision; and
    f) Provide HIV/AIDS related information, education and communication and condom
         distribution to the district work force.

Many of the activities financed under this component would directly support community-level
activities, including advocacy, training and promotion of community-led HIV/AIDS initiatives.

Component 3: Community-led HIV/AIDS Initiatives (CHAIs) (US$ 10 million, 20% of total
project costs)
This component would support community-led HIV/AIDS control activities directly carried out,
or contracted out, by community-based organizations, such as:
    a) Targeted support to orphans, guardians of poor orphans and AIDS stricken impoverished
         households, including those headed by females, children and elderly due to death of
         spouse, parent or guardian, conditional to families keeping school aged children in
         schools, for a minimum amount of time. In addition, pre-school and out-of-school
         orphans would be supported to attend day care centers and vocational training;
    b) Community-based information, education and communication; and
    c) Home-based care.

Unallocated: The project has $5 million IDA credit unallocated, which would be allocated to
District Initiatives or Community Initiatives based on progress review and project needs.

1.6 Revised Components
None of the components was formally revised.




                                                                                                   4

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)
Geographical Coverage for Components 2 and 3: The implementation of the district and
community components started in 9 districts and was expected to be scaled up nationwide. By the
second year, the project expanded to 30 districts (out of a total of 56 districts). However, due to
(i) the availability of new sources of HIV funding for other districts2, (ii) the risk of stretching
IDA resources and efforts too thin to make a difference, it was subsequently agreed that the two
components would not be expanded beyond those 30 districts. Component 1 and the HIV/AIDS
commodities procured at the national level benefited the whole country.

Financing Anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs): Under the MAP framework, the PAD does not explicitly
mention the financing of ARVs. However, during implementation, ARVs became much more
affordable and the treatment agenda more prominent. In response to the changing situation as
well as the GoU's request, UACP financed the first batch of ARV procurement for Uganda, and
by doing so, helped jumpstart antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the country3.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

Accelerated project preparation: The project was prepared in record time (less than three
months). This "rush" was mostly due to IDA's internal deadlines and mandates, rather than the
client's imperatives. The task team did its best to ensure quality at entry given this circumstance.
However, despite the team's best efforts, there were unavoidable trade-offs such as (i) the depth
of analysis; (ii) the elaboration of implementation arrangements, and (iii) the full understanding
and buy-in of the project by some stakeholders, especially communities and other donors; all of
which could have improved had the task team been given more time for preparation. For these
reasons, project implementation was slower than expected in the first year.

Positive aspects of project preparation and design include:

Background analysis: UACP made good use of the country background analysis conducted by
the GoU and stakeholders for (i) the NSF 200/1-2005/6 and (ii) Uganda's HIPC, PRSP and PRSC
processes. UACP was built on: (i) the country's own extensive experience in its fight against
HIV/AIDS; (ii) earlier related Bank-financed operations, e.g. the District Health Services Pilot




2 These include the Global Fund, the Uganda Program for Human and Holistic Development (UPHOLD)
and the AIDS/HIV Integrated Model District Programme (AIM) supported by the US government. In addition,
the IDA-financed Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (NUSAF) project also finances community
HIV/AIDS activities in the north.

3In total, US$ 2.7 million of the project credit was used for ARVs. Subsequently, other development
partners such as GFATM and USG became the major financiers of ARVs in Uganda.




                                                                                                       5

and Demonstration Project (DHSP)4; and (iii) the international experience in financing
community-driven interventions (which was new for Uganda at that time). The project conducted
an inventory of HIV/AIDS activities supported by other partners as part of the preparation
process.

Project design: The project design was harmonized with the national response by supporting the
NSF under the coordination of the Uganda AIDS Commission. This is in line with the "Three
One" principles which would later emerge and be adopted by the international community in
2003. The project has three clear objectives (prevention, mitigation and capacity building), which
are also among the objectives of the NSF. It has three distinct components organized by the type
of implementers (national level, districts and communities) which correspond to the GoU's
strategy to mobilize and unify the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic at three levels in the
context of decentralization. Under each component, activities to contribute to the PDOs were
clearly identified, making a clear link between the PDOs and project components. On the other
hand, the interface between the three components (e.g. the link between activities and
implementers at different levels) was less well-defined.

Innovative approach: Although Uganda had a long-standing tradition in multi-sectoral and
community responses to HIV/AIDS, these approaches were not yet systematically
operationalized, especially at the district level at the time. For this reason, it was innovative of the
project design to:
    (i)      support a multi-sector response that extends to the district level;
    (ii)     finance community-led interventions using a social fund approach; and
    (iii)    put the districts at the forefront of project implementation.

Adequate safeguards: Similar to all first-phase MAP projects, the project was classified in
category C for environment and therefore no environment assessment was required.

Nevertheless, project design could have been further strengthened in some areas:

The large number of multi-sectoral partners: As was common in all first-phase MAP projects,
Component 1 aims to scale up and mainstream HIV/AIDS interventions in all line ministries.
This represents a large number of implementers at the national level which (i) strained the
capacity of the Project Coordination Team and (ii) to some extent, diluted the resources. A more
focused multi-sectoral approach targeting a set of selected sectors which have the largest potential
impact on the epidemic would have been more effective.

Stakeholder involvement and participatory processes: The task team did its best to consult with
stakeholders and facilitate the participatory process (e.g. through a national stakeholder
workshop). However, had there been more preparation time, consultation could have been better,
especially with development partners and lower-level stakeholders.

Targeted interventions: In the discussion on project beneficiaries, the project discussed the
targeted preventive intervention approach for HIV-vulnerable groups (e.g. truck drivers, mobile
workers in the construction business, fishermen, military personnel, prisoners, commercial sex



4The IDA-financed Sexually Transmitted Infection Project (STIP) was still under implementation and its
lessons were not available at the time of UACP preparation.




                                                                                                      6

workers, men who have sex with men). This approach was technically sound and is still very
much relevant today. However, the project design did not elaborate how the targeting would be
actually carried out or monitored.

Risks and mitigations measures: UACP identified seven risks which are of four types (i) GoU's
commitment to HIV/AIDS control, (ii) low capacity of different implementers, (iii) poor inter-
sectoral collaboration, and (iv) fiduciary risks. Among them, four were classified as modest, there
substantial and none as high risks. Risk assessment therefore was on the optimistic side. In
retrospect, other risks could have been identified and mitigation measures developed accordingly.
These include:
    -    a weak UAC unable to fulfill fully its coordinating mandates for the national HIV/AIDS
         response;
    -    failure of implementers at the lower levels (especially districts and communities) to adopt
         the most effective interventions;
    -    the failure to reach high-risk groups with targeted interventions;
    -    complacency and erosion of prevention efforts in the context of introduction of treatment;
    -    risk of escalation of the conflict in the north on project implementation; and
    -    risks related to the project's sustainability.

A Quality at Entry assessment by QAG concluded that UACP was prepared quickly and
competently, and met all basic criteria for sound quality at entry. It therefore rated the project a
solid 2 rating (fully satisfactory) with some elements representing best practice.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)

The Project did not have the "at risk" status at any time during implementation. There was no
project restructuring. The mid-term review (MTR) was conducted in May 2004. According to the
MTR, the implementation of project activities were too ambitious and went beyond project
capacity and original project cost. While the project objectives and components remained
unchanged, it was agreed to give priority to the implementation of district and community
interventions, with a special focus on improving the coverage of HIV interventions in the second
half of the project.

Positive factors and events which influenced the project's achievements

More funding for HIV/AIDS control from other sources: At project appraisal, the total external
earmarked support for HIV/AIDS control in Uganda was around US$ 17 million per year. During
UACP implementation, the landscape of developmental aid for HIV/AIDS changed significantly,
especially with the advent of the GFATM and PEPFAR. As a result, resources for HIV/AIDS
increased significantly, particularly during the second half of the project. For example, the total
public resource envelope (GoU resources plus development assistance) for HIV/AIDS was
around US$ 38 million in 2003/04, rising by 150% to US$ 103 million in 2004/05, and again by
almost 50% to US$ 151 million in 2005/06.

The increasingly prominent ART agenda: Just like many other Sub-Saharan African countries,
Uganda saw an increasingly prominent treatment agenda as ART became more affordable and
feasible for large-scale implementation.




                                                                                                  7

A capable Project Coordination Team (PCT): UACP inherited the PCT from STIP. The capable
PCT was familiar with coordinating the implementation of an IDA-financed project as well as
IDA procedures. Its strong team provided good operational and technical support to the
implementers. To some extent, they helped filled in the gap caused by a not-so-strong UAC,
especially in the first half of the project.

A good Technical Resource Network: This was established early in the project to provide
technical advice to the project and has proven to be a very effective mechanism

Negative factors and events which influenced the project's achievements

Poor coordination of developmental assistance for HIV/AIDS: While there has been a significant
increase in external funding for HIV/AIDS as discussed above, financing modalities have been
increasingly fragmented and not well coordinated. The majority of the funding is off-budget and
earmarked for donors' perceived priorities in HIV/AIDS. This drives the HIV/AIDS agenda away
from the country's ownership and leadership, as well as makes it very difficult to estimate actual
expenditure levels and to effectively harmonize these resources.

Mismanagement of GFATM resources: In August 2005, GFATM temporarily suspended five
grants for Uganda (including those for HIV/AIDS) following an audit report by the Local
Funding Agent (LFA) which showed mismanagement of funds. The suspension was lifted in
November 2005 after the GoU ordered a judicial inquiry, which confirmed fraud. Although this
was not related to the UACP5, and there was never any corruption or governance issue identified
in the IDA project, this incident reflects unfavorably on the government's efforts in the fight
against HIV/AIDS. Since both the GFATM grants and the UACP support the common NSF, the
mismanagement and suspension of the GFATM resources represents a negative development
which influenced UACP's achievements.

Reduced emphasis on prevention compared to treatment and care: While the increasingly
prominent ART agenda is a positive development, it might have some untoward implications as
treatment and care in Uganda seemed to have been emphasized at the expense of prevention
efforts6. In addition, with the advent of ART, there seems to be a reduced perception of
HIV/AIDS as a threat demanding sustained response at all levels.

The diminishing role of condoms as a HIV prevention strategy: Uganda's behavioral change
strategy has become virtually synonymous with the ABC approach  Abstain, Be faithful, use
Condoms. It is generally agreed that positive changes in A, B and C behaviors occurred and all of
these contributed to the reduction of HIV in Uganda in the 1990s. However, during the last four
years or so, there has been a controversial attempt by some stakeholders (outside the project's
realm) to solely emphasize A and B and move away from C. This attempt sparked a major
national and international debate in prevention strategies which is well documented in the
HIV/AIDS literature. Although Uganda's official stance on ABC remained unchanged, and



5 The GFATM grants are managed by a Project Management Unit under the MOH, while UACP was
managed by a Project Coordination Team under the Uganda AIDS Commission.

6 For example, the share of care and treatment in Uganda's total public expenditure on HIV/AIDS
increased from 3% in 2003/4 to 40% in 2004/5.




                                                                                                 8

UACP continued its support for condoms procurement, promotion and distribution; the
effectiveness of condom intervention was diminished by such an unfavorable environment.

Condom quality and shortage: Condoms in Uganda have been financed by many sources
(GFATM, PEPFAR, UACP, etc.). Some batches of Engabu condoms (the type to be distributed
free in health clinics, financed by UACP) imported in August 2003 were found to have quality
issues when tested through sampling. As the result, they were withdrawn from circulation and
destroyed. This incident resulted in (i) mistrust of the Engabu condom brand in the population
and (ii) a temporary shortage of condoms while the problem was being resolved. UACP helped
Uganda avert the crisis by supporting (i) post-shipment quality control for condoms with the
financing of a condom testing machine and (ii) re-branding of the Egabu condoms which passed
the quality test and their re-introduction into circulation. With the support of other development
partners7, an emergency procurement of 20 million was also conducted. The problem was
eventually overcome but, coupled with the de-emphasizing of condoms (discussed above), it
certainly had untoward consequences on the effectiveness of prevention efforts in Uganda as
indicated by the evidence in lower condom use discussed in section 3.2.

Poor procurement planning and supply chain management: Procurement planning was poor for
the national HIV/AIDS response as a whole. There was no prioritized procurement plan for
HIV/AIDS commodities and this resulted in many emergency procurements. The capacity of
National Medical Stores to distribute health commodities was increasingly constrained by the
high volume of third party procurements. Under UACP, the issue of poor procurement planning
was identified early and aggressively addressed by the Bank team, the PCT and implementers.
Project procurement planning significantly improved after the mid-term review.

Limited capacity of the UAC: UAC had limited capacity and was unable to fulfill its coordination
and leadership mandates in the beginning. This was recognized as a significant constraint to the
national HIV/AIDS response, and stakeholders (including UACP) worked hard to address this. A
Partnership Committee and a Partnership Fund were established to support UAC in fulfilling its
coordination roles. UAC became stronger in the second year of the project, and successfully
conducted the annual HIV/AIDS Partnership Forum, Annual Joint Reviews, etc. However,
challenges remained such as the need to better harmonize HIV/AIDS funding, inputs and
activities from different initiatives.

Cash flow problem: Due to the limited financial management (FM) capacity of a large number of
implementers, especially at the lower levels, financial accountability reports were often delayed.
This in turn affected the replenishment of the Special Account and resulted in a severe cash flow
problem for the project. It was considered as the most important bottleneck in project
implementation for the first half of the project. UACP addressed this problem by: (i) simplifying
FM procedures and manuals for implementers; (ii) providing training and support in FM; (iii)
contracting accounting firms to provide accounting services; (iv) increasing the size of the
Special Account; and (v) switching to the Financial Management Report (FMR) disbursement
system. This was solved by the end of 2003 and project disbursement significantly improved.

Limited targeting of high-risk groups with preventive interventions: Although targeted preventive
interventions were featured in the project design, implementation of this approach was limited.



7 DFID, DANIDA and Ireland Aid




                                                                                                9

The MTR pushed for socio-geographical mapping of high-risk groups to facilitate targeted
interventions. This was carried out to some extent (e.g. the study of fishing communities around
Victoria Lake), but in general, with regard to prevention, there was more focus on IEC/BCC for
the general population.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design:
UACP has a reasonable M&E logical framework and an elaborate set of indicators which were
developed in close consultation with implementers. M&E arrangements were thorough.
Methodologies and strategies for data collection were envisioned from the beginning. Roles and
responsibilities of different implementers in M&E were well defined. In general, intermediate and
outcome indicators were adequate to monitor progress toward the first and second PDOs
(prevention and mitigation).

However, there are some areas in the M&E design which could have been strengthened. These
include:
    (i)     HIV prevalence was used as one of the impact indicators. (This is a common problem
            for most of the first-phase MAP projects and being addressed by IDA through the
            restructuring of active MAP projects)
    (ii)    Indicators for preventive interventions targeting high-risk groups were inadequate.
    (iii)   Given the gender differences, targets for some indicators (especially behavior) should
            be set differently for women and men when possible.
    (iv)    Indicators for the third PDO (capacity building) were inadequate. Especially, there
            are no indicators to assess the improvement in institutional development and capacity
            strengthening for UAC and communities.
    (v)     The link between the project M&E and the national strategic framework M&E could
            have been better defined and elaborated.
    (vi)    In the M&E framework, there seems to be the assumption that the expected outcomes
            are solely attributable to project inputs and outputs. However, there should have been
            the acknowledgment of the problems of attribution; as UACP is only one part of the
            national response to HIV/AIDS, and many other non-UACP activities also contribute
            to the achievement of the PDOs.

The M&E design is rated substantial.

M&E Implementation:
Similar to most MAP projects, M&E implementation was a challenge for UACP, especially
during the first half of the project. While M&E arrangements were well thought out in the design
as discussed above, it took some time for them to operationalize. For example, the MIS only
became functional two years into the project, and it was not until after the MTR that UACP was
able to recruit the M&E Specialist. However, once the arrangements were in place, very good
progress was made in M&E, especially after the MTR. Thanks to simplified reporting formats,
streamlined and strengthened MIS, and M&E capacity building for stakeholders, UACP was able
to significantly improve data collection, the information flow, and the timeliness and
completeness of reporting by most implementers. This enabled quarterly reports to be produced
on time. A culture of information-based decision making and planning was introduced (see
below).. Baseline data were supplemented by higher quality information from population-based
surveys (e.g. UDHS 2001) during project implementation. After MTR, the project also fine-tuned
its key indicators and targets with the availability of better data from the UDHS and LQAS



                                                                                               10

surveys. This was a commendable effort to make the indicators easier to monitor and targets
more realistic, although the revision did not go through formal approval procedures.
.
A highlight of M&E under UACP is the implementation of the LQAS survey. Although this
relatively low-cost and simple household survey instrument was not included in the original
M&E design, the country and the task team, with the technical support of from the Global
HIV/AIDS Monitoring and Evaluation Team, successfully introduced this methodology into
Uganda with two rounds of LQAS surveys  one before the MTR and one before the end of
project. This favorably reflects on the project's readiness and flexibility to adopt new M&E
techniques during implementation. In fact, UACP was the first HNP project in the Bank to apply
this survey instrument, which generates information on the coverage of key HIV interventions at
the sub-district level. Feedbacks from implementers were extremely positive: they felt greatly
empowered through their direct participation in the survey and their use of the findings for
planning. This was considered to be a M&E best practice and was shared in various international
fora. Interestingly, Ugandan implementers were able to internalize this methodology and
conducted the subsequent rounds by themselves and at a significantly lower cost. They also
extended the application of LQAS to other areas such as child health, investigating Schistosoma
mansoni prevalence, social services mapping, etc.

However, there are a couple of M&E implementation issues. First, the revision of indicators and
targets after the MTR should have been adopted through formal approval procedures. Second, the
link between UACP M&E and the UAC M&E system was not strong. Due to this disconnect, it
was mostly the M&E capacity of the PCT that was strengthened rather than that of UAC. After
the project closing, the MIS of UACP was transferred to and harmonized with UAP M&E
system.

Implementation of M&E is rated substantial.

M&E Utilization:
The use of M&E for decision making was good, especially of the LQAS information. For the first
time in Uganda, districts had solid information on their performance to inform decision making,
which was reflected in all UACP districts' HIV/AIDS work plans. This is a good example of
decentralized M&E to generate local information for local decision making. LQAS as well as
other M&E data were also used by the stakeholders to make tactical changes to the project
activities at mid-term review.

The utilization of data is rated substantial.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)
Safeguards: The project was given a C rating for environmental safeguards and therefore no
environmental assessment was required. On the other hand, an environment assessment
(including heath) was conduced under the PRSC project and environmental safeguards were fully
complied with in the context of PRSC.

Financial management: As discussed above, in the first half of the project, there was a severe
clash flow problem due to two reasons. First, under a decentralized arrangement, UACP involved
a large number of grass-root level implementers with limited fiduciary capacity. This resulted in
delays in submission of receipts of accountability by implementers to the PCT and affected the
replenishment of the Special Account. Second, the size of Special Account was small. This was
successfully resolved by: (i) an increase in the size of the Special Account; (ii) the use of four


                                                                                               11

accounting firms to support districts to prepare accountability reports; which tremendously
improved the turn-around time and quality of accountability reports; (iii) simplified procedures
for the disbursement of community grants in line with new IDA disbursement guidelines for
community sub-projects under MAP; and (iv) the conversion to FMR-based disbursement.
Otherwise, there was no major financial management issue. All the audit reports were submitted
in compliance with IDA requirements and deemed to be unqualified.

Procurement: As discussed above, the key challenge was poor procurement planning for the
national HIV/AIDS response as a whole, resulting in many emergency procurements.
Procurement capacity of CHAI implementers was particularly limited. This problem was
addressed by: (i) close implementation support in procurement; (ii) revision and adherence to the
project procurement plan; (iii) development and dissemination of a simple manual for
procurement planning for communities; and (iv) simplification of the Project Procurement
Guidelines for districts and communities. As the result, procurement by lower level implementers
significantly improved in the second half of the project. The positive lessons from the CHAI
procurement were used by the government in revising the Local Government Act to allow for
community procurement. By the project end, all UACP procurements were completed. There
were no major issues identified by ex-post procurement reviews.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)
Toward the end of the project, steps were taken to transfer some capacity, especially in M&E,
from PCT to UAC. Other than the use of Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (NUSAF) project
to support community sub-projects in the north, GoU has not put in place systematic
arrangements to continue support for HIV/AIDS activities by communities and some line-
ministries. IDA recently conducted a scoping mission to Uganda to discuss with the government
and partners on future options for IDA's continued support to the national HIV/AIDS response.
As discussed above, over the last three years, there have been significant increases in external
support for HIV/AIDS in Uganda. The challenge is to harmonize and consolidate those different
funding sources to improve effectiveness and efficiency of HIV spending. IDA will support a
study to review available external funding for HIV/AIDS and identify additional financial needs.
Future IDA support and its modality will hinge upon the recommendations of the study. There is
also a plan to consolidate all IDA CDD operations (include support for HIV/AIDS at the
community level) into one project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)
Relevance of PDOs: As of the time of ICR, the PDOs are still highly relevant because (i)
HIV/AIDS remains a significant threat to health and development in Uganda, (ii) addressing
HIV/AIDS is part of the 5th pillar in the country's current Poverty Eradication Action Plan
(PEAP) of 2004, and (iii) HIV/AIDS is one of the priorities of the current Uganda Joint
Assistance Strategy prepared by IDA and other development partners.

Relevance of design: First, the recent significant injection of external HIV/AIDS funding from
different sources calls for improved planning and coordination of the national response. This
includes the need for harmonization and consolidation of different funding mechanisms and



                                                                                              12

inputs for HIV/AIDS to improve the efficiency of HIV/AIDS expenditures. In this context, a
SWAP-like operation embedded in the National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS would be in a better
position to help the government use resources more efficiently and effectively, regardless of the
source. Second, the design lacked a technical and economic assessment of the NSF. Instead of
accepting the NSF as a whole, the project should have conducted a technical and economic
assessment of the plan to prioritize interventions and identify priority areas which the project
should focus on. Third, the link between HIV/AIDS and other closely related health issues in the
design is weak. This is a missed opportunity, as HIV/AIDS has strong links to other health issues
such as sexual and reproductive health, and tuberculosis. Therefore, the relevance of the project
design is only modest.

Relevance of implementation: At the time of the ICR, project components and implementation
arrangements are still substantially relevant. However, the number of multi-sectoral and civil
society implementers should be limited to those with the largest potential impact on the epidemic
based on their comparative advantages.

On balance, relevance of objectives, design and implementation is substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)
UACP supported the goals of the NSF, which is in turn also financed by many other different
sources of funding (GoU, GFATM, bilaterals, etc.). All of these contribute to the same higher
level objectives of prevention, care, support and mitigation. In this context, different inputs from
different projects (or sources of funding) often contribute to the same outputs and outcomes. This
makes attribution almost impossible. Therefore, instead of attempting to attribute a certain extent
of the achievement of the PDOs to the UACP, the ICR will examine the contribution of the
project to the achievement of the PDOs. In addition, the revision of indicators and targets at
MTR, while represents an improvement, did not go through formal approval process as discussed
above. For this reason, this ICR (i) relies on the original indicators and targets as the basis for
assessment (as shown in the Results Framework Analysis or RFA) and (ii) uses the progress
against the revised indicators and targets as additional evidence.

PDO1 (Reduce the spread of HIV infection).
According to the 2005 National HIV Sentinel Surveillance data,, the target of reducing the HIV
prevalence among pregnant women to below 6% was met in rural areas (5%) but missed in urban
areas (7%). According to the 2005 UHSBS data, this target was almost achieved (6.5% in
pregnant women). However, HIV prevalence rate is not a good indicator for progress in reducing
the spread of HIV infection. Incidence, while a better indicator for this purpose, is difficult to
monitor8. Available estimates of adult incidence rates through modeling indicate: (i) a steep fall
in incidence in the late 1980s and early 1990s, long before the start of the project; (ii) stabilization
of incidence during most of the project implementation period; and (iii) a small increase in the
last two years (Graph 1).




8 Incidence is monitored though cohort studies. On this basis, national incidence is estimated through
modeling.




                                                                                                       13

Intermediate outcome indicators related to behavior change are better indicators of prevention
progress9. As demonstrated by UDHS and UHSBS data in the RFA, out of the project's three
behavior indicators, two show progress for women between 2001 and 2005, namely (i) increasing
condom use in last high-risk sex (from 28% to 47%) and (ii) reducing the proportion of sexually
active youth (from 49% to 46%). However, these two indicators worsen for men (from 59% to
53%, and 39% to 42%, respectively). The third behavioral indicator (non-regular sex partners)
indicate set backs for both genders, with the proportion of women reporting non-regular sex
partners increasing from 11% to 15% and men from 21% to 37% over the same period.

If one considers the progress against the revised indicators and targets at MTR which were
monitored by the LQAS surveys, the data seem to confirm worsening trend in condom use in men
(Table 1). However, the two rounds of LQAS surveys show that the revised target of reducing the
proportion of youth aged 15-24 having sex with non regular partners to below 20% was fully
achieved (16.8%) in the UACP districts (Table 1). They also show significant increases in
HIV/AIDS related knowledge between 2003 and 2006 in UACP districts (See Table 2 of Annex 2
for more details).

The goal of reducing reported STIs in men aged 15-49 was not achieved either against the
original target (see the RFA) or the revised one (Table 1). On the other hand, there was a marked
increase in the utilization of VCT and PMTCT services in UACP districts. Between 2003 and
2006, the proportion of adults who had used VCT service and received their test results increased
from 23% to 32.3% for men, and from 24.5% to 38.3% for women. The proportion of mothers of
young infants using PMTCT service also increased from 13.7% to 34.5%. These correspond with
a significant scale up in VCT and PMTCT services in as shown in the RFA.

In conclusion, it is a mixed picture in HIV/AIDS prevention with: (i) no significant increase in
incidence; (ii) improving knowledge of HIV/AIDS;, (iii) improvement in two project behavior
indicators for women; (iv) achievement of one revised behavior indicator and corresponding
target for youth; (v) increases in VCT and PMTCT utilization; and (v) stagnation or declination in
other safer sex behavior and practices, including condom use For these reasons, achievement of
PDO1 is rated as modest.

UACP contributed to this PDO through supporting: (i) condom procurement (160 million male
condoms), quality control, promotion and distribution; (ii) procurement of STI drugs and
diagnostics, HIV test kits, infection control supplies; (iii) scaling up VCT and PMTCT services;
and (iv) IEC/BCC activities at national, district and communities levels. The latter include: (i) the
development and implementation of a Multi-sectoral Behavior Change Communication Strategy
in 24 districts; (ii) the development and dissemination of IEC/BCC materials; (iii) life skills
program in 130 secondary schools; (iv) mass media campaigns (e.g. radio programs); (v)
community BCC in CHAIs. (See Table 3 of Annex 2 for more details).




9UDHS and UHSBS data are comparable, but not with results of the LQAS due to different
methodologies. LQAS was carried out in the UACP districts only and the results from different rounds are
comparable.

PDO2 (Mitigate the health and socio-economic impact of HIV/AIDS at individual and household
and community levels)
Coverage of care, support and mitigation interventions for PLWHAs and OVCs has significantly
increased in 30 UACP districts. According to the LQAS data, the proportion of PLWHA
registered with service organizations benefiting from some form of support increased from a
baseline of 30% in 2000 to 76% in 2003 and 86% in 2006. Between 2003 and 2006, there was a
significant increase in the number of beneficiaries of care and support by the project - six-fold for
PLWHA (from 5,504 to 33,309) and 23-fold for orphans (from 12,979 to 301,129) (Table 1).
Over the same period, the percentage of school-age orphans (6-18 years) receiving educational
support from the project increased from 14% to 22%. This increase was from 18.8% to 30.4 % for
CHAI villages, and from 13.6% to 20.9% for non-CHAI villages in UACP districts (Table 2).
Anti-retroviral Therapy (ART) was scaled-up significantly, covering 85,000 out of approximately
200,000 eligible patients10. However, the target for school attendance for orphans was not met
(71% against a target of 80% established at MTR). The coverage of DOTS for the management
of TB, a common opportunistic infection in PLWHA, improved significantly from 13% to 100%
of the districts.

The achievement of PDO 2 is therefore rated as substantial.

UACP contributed to this PDO through supporting: (i) the launch of the public sector free ART
program with the procurement of ARVs, CD4 count machines, and other laboratory equipment,
(ii) drugs for TB and other opportunistic infections, (iii) care and support for 33,309 PLWHA,
and (iv) care and support for more than 0.3 million OVC. (See Table 3 of Annex 2 for more
details).


10 . ART was jumpstarted with UACP support and this coverage was subsequently achieved with
contribution from other initiatives (e.g. GFATM and PEPFAR) as well.




                                                                                                  15

     PDO3 (Strengthen the capacity of communities, civil society and government to respond to the
     epidemic)
     UACP had a significant role in building up the capacity in HIV/AIDS policy development,
     planning, implementation and M&E for stakeholders in key sectors and at all levels. The project
     was highly successful in strengthening the capacity of communities and districts. After UACP
     funding ended, many of the district CSOs and CHAI groups, with their enhanced capacity, have
     become implementers under other partners' HIV/AIDS initiatives. The project thus helped build a
     strong capacity foundation from which other programs (e.g. GFATM, PEPFAR) are benefiting.
     UACP's contribution to building the capacity of line ministries and national CSOs is also
     substantial. On the other hand, the strengthening of UAC to fulfill its coordination mandates only
     happened in the second half of the project as discussed above.

     UACP contributed to this PDO through supporting capacity building and the operation of: (i) the
     HIV/AIDS Committee and the HIV/AIDS focal person in each of the 15 line ministries; (ii) the
     District HIV/AIDS Committees and District HIV/AIDS Focal Persons in 30 districts; (iii) 38
     national and 233 district levels CSOs; and (vi) 3,627 community groups. It also supported the
     training of health professionals, local government personnel and Community Development
     Officers in various HIV/AIDS-related topics. Details of the achievements of this PDO at different
     levels are further elaborated in the discussion below on project achievements by components as
     well as in Table 3 of Annex 2.

     The achievement of this PDO is rated as substantial.

     Overall, the achievement of all three PDOs is rated as substantial.

Achievements by Components

Component 1: National level (US$ 36.2 million or 65% of total project cost11)
All 15 line ministries were able to appoint HIV/AIDS focal persons, formed functional
HIV/AIDS committees, and implemented HIV/AIDS work plans. Sector HIV/AIDS policies,
strategic plans and mainstreaming guidelines were developed. However, in many cases,
mainstreaming HIV/AIDS was mostly restricted to workplace programs, and "external"
mainstreaming (e.g. reaching out to the populations served by the sector) was limited. Strong
performers include the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education and Sports, and the Ministry
of Gender, Labor and Social Development which have witnessed rapid scaling up of their
programs in the last two years. Other than the strong performers, national line ministries' support
to their counterparts at lower levels could have been better.

In addition to the line ministries, 38 national-level NGOs were also supported to carry out
HIV/AIDS interventions. Especially, the project helped with the establishment and strengthening
the national networks of PLWHA and AIDS support organizations.

UACP helped strengthen the Uganda AIDS Commission through: (i) supporting technical
assistance in finance, planning, monitoring and evaluation; (ii) supporting development of the
overarching policy on HIV/AIDS; (iii) revision of the NSF; and (iv) construction of the new UAC
headquarters. These, together with creation of the Self Coordinating Entities and the coordination
framework for district HIV/AIDS activities, enabled the Uganda AIDS Commission to enhance
its coordination role. While institutional arrangements were put in place, UAC is still facing a
major challenge in coordinating, harmonizing and monitoring various HIV/AIDS financing



11 Of this, US$ 27.19 million (36% of total project costs) were for the procurement HIV/AIDS
commodities to be used at all levels and in all 56 districts.




                                                                                                 17

mechanisms in country, making it difficult to effectively determine, plan and deploy inputs for
HIV/AIDS.

The achievement of this component is rated as modest.

Component 2: District level (US$ 8.69 million or 15% of total project cost )
With UACP support, 30 districts were able to formulate and implement comprehensive multi-
sectoral HIV/AIDS work plans in line with the decentralization policy. District level work plans
included IEC/BCC, condom promotion and distribution, VCT and PMTCT, Directly Observed
Treatment of Tuberculosis (DOTS), management of STI, treatment, care and support for
PLWHA, capacity building activities as well as mobilizing and supervising CHAI initiatives. 233
district-level CSOs were also supported to carry out HIV/AIDS interventions. School-based BCC
programs and CSO activities are reported to be among the most successful activities under the
district component.

The project supported district-level coordination, planning and implementation of HIV/AIDS
activities through the establishment and operationalization of District HIV/AIDS Committees
which has been strengthened since MTR. A recent study shows that UACP-supported districts
have better institutional arrangements for planning and reporting of their HIV/AIDS programs.

UACP funded training of over 1000 personnel from district local governments as well as district
level CSOs in strategic planning; 184 Community Development Officers (CDOs) from the 30
districts to serve as trainers of trainers to train Community Development Assistants (CDAs) in the
districts and backstop DAC and CSOs in monitoring all district community HIV/AIDS initiatives.

UACP also funded the training of: (i) 564 sub-country level CDAs from 30 districts to strengthen
the local government's capacity for mobilizing community; (ii) 450 district level government and
non-government service providers from 30 districts in LQAS, (iii) 227 district health personnel
from 4 districts in the use of the new HMIS that incorporates HIV/AIDS indicators; (iv) 78
district personnel from 30 districts in the use of database for HIV/AIDS data collection,
management and reporting; (v) 1172 agricultural and fisheries extension workers in HIV/AIDS;
and (vi) 1074 farmers through the Uganda Farmers Federation. Especially, the project supported
the establishment of district and sub-district network of PLWHA and by doing so strengthened
the participation of PLWHA.

The achievement of this component is rated substantial

Component 3: Community level (US$ 11.30 million or 20% of total project cost)
3,627 CHAI groups were supported by UACP with a total direct funding of US$ 9.78 million,
providing: (i) educational support to 301,129 orphans; (ii) care and mitigation support to 33,309
persons living with HIV/AIDS; (iii) IEC/BCC interventions for more than 0.5 million people
(Table 3). The majority of sub-projects were OVC-related. The LQAS surveys of 2003 and 2006
show better outcomes for orphans in CHAI villages than those in non-CHAI villages (Table 2).
There were fewer projects in home-based care, community AIDS education, and condom
distribution. However, this component built up a network of providers who went on to implement
other HIV/AIDS initiatives funded by other development partners. CHAI has often been
recognized by stakeholders as the most successful and popular component of the project which
greatly contributed to the empowerment of communities.

The achievement of this component is rated as high.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)
Efficiency is modest for various reasons. First, in the NSF which UACP supported, there was
little prioritization of interventions on the basis of cost-effectiveness12. As the result, there was an
imbalance between prevention vs. care, treatment and support. Second, within prevention, there
was little targeting of the drivers of the epidemic and geographical "hot spots". Third, the
integration of HIV/AIDS activities was limited, especially among CHAI. For example, many
community sub-projects tended to focus on narrow aspects of care or support while other
interventions such as BCC and condom promotion could have been added without significant
marginal costs. Fourth, the government's weak harmonization and coordination of various
HIV/AIDS resources and inputs from different sources also made UACP less efficient.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: moderately satisfactory
With a substantial (or 3 out of a 4 point scale) rating for project relevance, substantial (3 out of 4)
rating for project efficacy and modest (2 out of 4) rating for efficiency, the overall outcome rating
is moderately satisfactory (8 out of 12 point scale).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
HIV/AIDS is a well known cause of poverty. By limiting the spread HIV and mitigating its
consequences, the project is expected to have helped to prevent or reduce HIV-related poverty.
Unfortunately, the extent of the project's poverty reduction impacts cannot be quantified.
However, the majority of the beneficiaries of the community-led interventions are OVCs,
PLWHA, AIDS-afflicted households and the rural poor. There seems to be a gender balance




12 The new National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS 2007/8-2011-12 which is being finalized addresses this
issue through a costing and prioritization exercise.




                                                                                                     19

among the project beneficiaries. For example, 50.6% of all OVC supported by the UACP were
female.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)
As discussed above, institutional strengthening is substantial, especially at the lower levels.
Districts and communities have been mobilized and greatly empowered to implement HIV/AIDS
interventions. This is one of the high lights of the project. In fact, the strengthened community
capacity under UACP informed the revision of the Local Government Act to better enable
community participation in grass-root development.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
N/A

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)
An end-of-project stakeholder workshop was held with participants from different levels. Key
findings on project achievements included: (i) the project played a critical role in operationalizing
the multi-sectoral response; (ii) capacity for HIV/AIDS response was strengthened at all levels;
and (iii) the community response stood out for being innovative and the most successful
component of the project. The main challenge identified was to maintain some of these successes
after the project closing as, other than UACP, there was no other funding mechanism which
systematically financed the multi-sectoral and community activities. This in turn pointed to the
need for a follow-on project. The workshop also discussed the cross cutting issues of the national
HIV/AIDS response, namely the shortages of HIV/AIDS commodities due to poor procurement
planning and supply chain management, as well as the fragmentation of HIV/AIDS funding
mechanisms.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The risk to development outcome is significant for the following reasons:
Institutional: The PCT was the key provider of coordination and implementation support for
UACP implementers. After project closing, some of the PCT capacity was absorbed by the UAC.
However, it is obvious that implementers will not be able to get the same level of support as
under UACP.
Financial support for the multi-sectoral and community response: For most line-ministries,
HIV/AIDS has not been mainstreamed in their sector annual budgets. Some key line ministries
(e.g. Health, Education) have access to funding by other donors after project closing. Other than
that, there is no mechanism to systematically sustain the multi-sectoral response. The situation is
similar for the community component. This shows the need to develop longer-term funding
mechanisms for the multi-sectoral and community response.
Prevention: As shown by recent data, the risk of prevention complacency and reversal of good
behavior is significant. This can be exacerbated by inappropriate prevention strategies (e.g.
abstinence only) and the failure to target the drivers of the epidemic with effective preventive
interventions.
Treatment sustainability: Most of the current external support is time-bound and earmarked for
treatment and care. While treatment is a long-term agenda, there is no mechanism to ensure
financial sustainability for treatment. This unresolved issue is critical, given the need to: (i)
continue treatment for those already on ART; (ii) expand ART to other eligible patients; and (iii)




                                                                                                  20

address the eventual emergence of HIV strains resistant to first-line drugs which will drive up the
cost of ART.

To help the country better address the risk to development outcomes, the Bank conducted a
scoping mission in April 2007 to identify areas which IDA can provide support as the next steps.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
The project was efficiently prepared in record time. Overall, the financial, technical and
institutional aspects of design were appropriate. As discussed in 2.1, the project objectives were
responsive to the government's NSF. Structured along the lines of a standard MAP, the design
also used Uganda's extensive experience in fighting HIV/AIDS, the lessons from previous IDA
operations, as well as from other sectors (especially social funds). Despite the time constraint, the
team ensured adequate consultations, and detailed preparation for the start-up period. Design
could have been strengthened by: (i) a technical and economic assessment of the NSF; (ii) a more
realistic risk assessment and mitigation; (iii) a focused multi-sectoral approach; and (iv) inclusion
of capacity building indicators in the result framework. A quality at entry assessment was
conducted by QAQ with which graded Bank performance as satisfactory. The assessment focused
on institutional aspects, M&E, risks and implementation. However, it did not discuss issues such
as prioritization of interventions, technical efficacy and efficiency of the project design.

The Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Regular supervision was conducted with quality implementation support, especially in public
health, community response, M&E, institutional arrangements and the fiduciary areas. Especially,
the Bank involved sector specialists (education, CDD, gender) in supervision, who were
instrumental in conducting dialogue and providing support to their respective ministry
counterparts. The transfer of the task team leadership to the country-based staff facilitated
interactions with and support to implementers on a continuous basis in the second half of the
project. An on-time and thorough MTR was conducted which greatly enhanced implementation
in the second half of the project. With the introduction of the LQAS methodology, the task team
significantly strengthened the "learning by doing" approach. During implementation, the Bank
fostered good partnerships with other DPs. This improved their understanding and buy-in of the
project. Good dialogue was maintained with the GoU throughout the project. The Bank managed
to leverage its IDA funding to help address various cross-cutting issues. For example, through the
financing of the first batch of ARVs, the Bank successfully encouraged the government to
develop a national ARV strategy. The Bank team was proactive in helping the client to address
bottlenecks in procurement and financial management as discussed above. An area in supervision
which could have been strengthened was that more dialogue and technical assistance would have
helped the project better to address the targeting agenda in prevention.

The Bank's performance in ensuring quality supervision is rated satisfactory.




                                                                                                  21

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
With satisfactory preparation and supervision, the overall Bank performance is satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
a) Government Performance
The Government prepared for this project well, most notably with the development of the NSF,
one of the first comprehensive national HIV/AIDS strategic plans in Africa, which served as the
project's foundation. This was one of the factors enabling the project preparation to be completed
in record time. All the covenants and agreements were complied with. Counterpart funding,
though delayed at various points of the project's life, was eventually fulfilled as as planned.
However, there are areas in which Government performance could have been improved.

    (i)     The Project Steering Committee, established to provide general oversight to project
            implementation, did not meet regularly and was unable to provide adequate guidance
            to the project.
    (ii)    The mismanagement of the GFATM grants, though not related to the project as
            discussed above, reflected unfavorably on the government's efforts in the fight
            against HIV/AIDS.
    (iii)   The GoU should have acted more aggressively to address the "abstinence only"
            controversy.

The Government's performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
UAC: UAC capacity was limited at the beginning. After the first year, it became stronger and was
able to carry out its coordination functions. However, it is still facing major challenge in
coordinating various funding sources for HIV/AIDS. On the other hand, the PCT was very
capable and formed the backbone for the project coordination. In many cases, it played the role of
the UAC in supporting the project implementers at all levels. The PCT was theoretically
considered to be part of the UAC, but given its limited lifespan (it was disbanded after project
closing) and independent mode of operation, its satisfactory performance cannot be counted
toward UAC's performance. For the above reasons, UAC performance is rated as moderately
satisfactory.

Line ministries: As discussed above, the performance of line ministries is moderately satisfactory.

Districts, Communities and CSOs: As discussed above, the performance of districts, community
and CSOs is satisfactory.

Overall, the performance of implementing agencies is moderately satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Considering (a) and (b), the overall Borrower's performance is moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)
The multi-sectoral approach: First, there is a need for a more focused multi-sectoral approach
which prioritizes sectors with the largest potential impact on the epidemic such as health,
education, transport, labor, gender and defense on the basis of their comparative advantages.
Second, mainstreaming in the multi-sectoral approach should go beyond workplace interventions


                                                                                                22

for staff in the line ministries to include interventions for the populations which the sectors serve.
Third, technical assistance to key line ministries is important in building capacity, and this
includes the involvement of sector specialists to provide support to line ministries. Fourth, district
departments that received regular and consistent support from the central line ministries have a
better chance of success, which underlines the importance of central support to lower-level
sectoral implementers.

Community response: Communities can be successfully mobilized to implement HIV/AIDS
interventions. CHAI has put them into the driver's seat in the grass-root development
agenda13.However, the demand-driven community response tends to focus on certain areas
deemed by communities as priorities such as support for OVCs and PLWHA while not
adequately addressing topics such as the targeting of high-risk groups, BCC and condom
promotion. To improve the effectiveness of the community response, efforts should be made to:
(i) provide communities with adequate guidance on "what works" in HIV/AIDS; (ii) encourage
the integration among various community-level HIV/AIDS interventions; (iii) provide user-
friendly BCC instructions/materials to guide community HIV/AIDS discussions; and (iv)
strengthen the link between community and HIV/AIDS service providers. In addition, where
CSOs are used to mobilize, provide support and supervise communities, community sub-projects
are more successful.

Prevention: The risk of scaling up care and treatment agenda at the expense of prevention is real..
Financial sustainability of the ART efforts is unlikely if Uganda is unable to reduce the number of
new infections. Targeted preventive interventions for high-risk groups and IEC/BCC for the
general population are not mutually exclusive. There is still a need to focus on the drivers of the
epidemic in a generalized epidemic setting like Uganda.

HIV/AIDS commodities: It is critical to ensure a non-disrupted supply of HIV/AIDS commodities
(condoms, drugs, test kits etc.) through good procurement planning and supply chain
management. This is especially important for district-level implementation.

M&E: The success of the LQAS demonstrates the importance of the principle "local information
for local decision making". It also greatly facilitates the "learning by doing" approach.

Coordination of various HIV/AIDS funding sources: While Uganda has very advanced health
SWAP, the national HIV/AIDS response is less well coordinated. Little is known about the fund
flows or who is funding what for HIV/AIDS. There is a need to put in place functional
mechanisms for coordination, alignment and harmonization of the major funding streams for
HIV/AIDS.

Transparency and accountability: As discussed above, unlike the GFATM grants, there was no
corruption/governance issue identified under UACP. This can be attributed to: (i) the use of the
independent Technical Resource Network; (ii) the project's emphasis on transparency and
accountability of budget allocation and expenditures14; (iii) clear eligibility criteria for



13 Many CHAIs became CBOs or expanded their activity scope beyond HIV/AIDS.

14 For example, budget allocations for the districts are made known to all stakeholders, including members
of the parliament, district authorities and community members.




                                                                                                       23

implementers; (iv) the contracting of accounting firms to help the districts with financial
management issues; and (v) fiduciary capacity building for CSOs.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
Below is the Executive Summary of the Borrower's ICR. The full report is available from the
Uganda AIDS Commission.

Introduction.    The Government of Uganda requested access to IDA resources within the
framework of the first phase of the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program (MAP) for the Africa
Region to sustain present HIV/AIDS activities started under Sexually Transmitted Infections
Project (STIP) but also step up the National response by addressing gaps and challenges;
ensuring multi-sectoral planning and implementation; and continuing to build capacity as a key
cornerstone in confronting the epidemic as well as taking the initiatives down to the community
level. UACP became effective on the 14th May 2001 though actual implementation commenced
in July 2001 and it is scheduled to close on the 31st December 2006. The Uganda HIV/AIDS
Control Project (UACP) was designed to support the goals of the National Strategic Framework
for HIV/AIDS 2000/01 to 2005/06. It was a 53 USD million International Development
Association loan from the World Bank and Government of Uganda provided USD 2.59 million
as counterpart funds.

Project Objectives. The Uganda HIV/AIDS Control Project (UACP) objectives were derived
from the goals of the Government of Uganda's National Strategic Framework (NSF) for
HIV/AIDS 2001-2006, which aimed to: a) Reduce the spread of HIV infection; b) Mitigate the
health and socioeconomic impact of HIV/AIDS at individual, household and community levels;
and c) Strengthen the national capacity to respond to the epidemic. The NSF proposed to attain
these goals by financing a multi-sectoral response including, line ministries, districts, civil
society, private sector and communities. After the midterm review, the project focused on six
program areas: Behavioural Change Communication (BCC); Capacity Building; Supervision,
Monitoring and Evaluation including Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS); Quality Services
Delivery including STI management, VCT and condoms use; Treatment, Care and Support of
Persons Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs); and Care and Support for orphans.

Project Scope. The project initiated and sustained a national and decentralised multi-sectoral
response to the HIV/AIDS scourge through support to the public sector and Civil Society
Organisations (CSOs) and through direct support to Community-led HIV/AIDS Initiatives
(CHAIs). The contribution of UACP to the achievement of the three goals of the NSF was mainly
through service delivery and capacity building for implementation at the National, District and
Community levels. UACP pioneered the widest ever community led HIV/AIDS initiative in
Uganda that has guaranteed the delivery of services at the grass roots providing support to very
many needy orphans and PLWHAs. The project supported the following 15 line ministries to
mainstream HIV/AIDS activities as part of their core business: Health; Uganda AIDS
Commission; Education and Sports; Gender, Labour and Social Development; Local
Government; Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries; Public Service; Internal Affairs (Police
and Prisons); Justice and Constitutional Affairs; Foreign Affairs; Defence (UPDF); Finance and
Economic Development; Lands, Water and Environment; Office of the President and Office of
the Auditor General. The line ministries have HIV/AIDS focal persons appointed, functional
HIV/AIDS committees, operational HIV/AIDS workplans in place and were supported to
develop HIV/AIDS policies and guidelines and to carry out HIV/AIDS workplace programmes.
The project has also been an important support to both national and district level Civil Society
Organizations (CSOs), the latter being supported through the local governments on demand for
their services. To date, 36 national level and 233 district level CSOs have received funding from
the project. UACP supported HIV/AIDS activities in the following 30 districts: Apac, Arua,
Bushenyi, Hoima, Iganga, Jinja, Kabale, Kabarole, Kaberamaido, Kalangala, Kampala, Kamuli,



                                                                                               36

Kamwenge, Kayunga, Kitgum, Kyenjojo, Lira, Masaka, Masindi, Mayuge, Mbale, Mbarara,
Moyo, Mukono, Nakapiripirit, Rakai, Sironko, Soroti, Tororo and Wakiso.       In these 30 districts,
by September 30th, 2006, the project had funded 3,629 HIV/AIDS community subprojects.

Project inputs and outputs. Between 2001 and 2006, UACP has been an important source of
funds for procurement of HIV/AIDS commodities and logistics such as:
      STI drugs and reagents (US$ 2.454 million);
      TB drugs (US$ 1.911 million);
      Infection control sundries (US$ 0.351 million);
      160 million male latex condoms (US$ 3.550 million);
      Selected opportunistic infection drugs (US$ 0.190 million);
      Test kits for VCT, syphilis and surveillance (US$ 0.400);
      54 motor vehicles (US$ 0.770 million);
      5 motorboats (US$ 0.361 million);
      168 motorcycles (US$ 0.305 million);
      ARV drugs (US$ 2.743 million);
      2 Viral load analysers (US$ 450,000);
      13 sets of equipment comprising of Clinical Chemistry Analysers, Flow Cytometers and
          Haematology Analysers plus reagents (US$ 3.474 million;
      122 portable generators (US$ 209,769);
      123 LCD projectors (US$ 554,683);
      90 Computers (US$ 243,192);
      58 Printers (US$ 34,760);
      122 Video decks (US$ 37,464); and
      7 Television screens (US$ 2,388).

The project was also very responsive to funding innovative approaches in the implementation as
evidenced by the launching of the public sector free ARVs scheme and procurement of CD4
count machines for use by the public sector thereby increasing the accessibility of Antiretroviral
treatment (ART) to the poorer segments of the population. UACP initiated in-country post-
shipment testing of condoms through procurement of the condom testing machine (US$ 0.190
million) thus greatly reducing the costs of overseas post- shipment testing. The project also
supported the pioneering of the idea of a multisectoral behavioural change communication
strategy and that of a community education HIV/AIDS flip chart. UACP piloted the first ever
district level determination of HIV/AIDS behavioural markers using the Local Quality and
Assurance Surveys (LQAS) and applied the results to the district HIV/AIDS programming. The
project has set the platform for an enhanced multisectoral response to the HIV/AIDS scourge
through support to sector and district strategic planning and HIV/AIDS mainstreaming guidelines
development. UACP funded the construction of the Uganda AIDS Commission (UAC)
secretariat offices (US$ 0.550 million).

Project outcomes. To determine the impact of the project on outcome indicators within Districts,
Local Quality Assurance and Supervision (LQAS) surveys were carried out in 2003 for 19
districts and in 2004 for the rest of the 11 districts. The indicator values of this baseline were
compared for 12 of the first 19 districts in a repeat LQAS in 2006 for determination of trends in
UACP funded districts and the results by the three objectives are described below:

(i) Reduction in the spread of HIV. In the project area, between 2003 and 2006, there is evidence
for increasing knowledge about the prevention and transmission of HIV and STIs. However,
condom use among the population appears to be on the decline. In particular, condom use has


                                                                                                37

decreased most probably due to the lack of supply of the Engabu condom over the past 3 years
that provided the bulk of the free condoms The impact indicator for reduction in the spread of
HIV infection was the percentage of pregnant women that test positive for HIV during unlinked
anonymous sentinel surveillance at selected antenatal clinics. Trends in this indicator when the
years 2002 and 2005 are compared show that there was a slight decrease in some (5) and a slight
increase in others (5) in the districts supported by UACP.

(ii) Mitigate the health and socio-economic impact of HIV/AIDS at individual, household and
community levels. Generally, service organizations providing care and support for PLWHAs are
registering better coverage of most of the indicators in 2006 when compared to 2003.The
percentage of PLWHAs registered with service organizations that received medical care in the
last one month of all PLWHAs who required medical care remained high with a finding of 92.6
percent in 2006 compared to 96.4 percent in 2003. The percentage of PLWHAs registered with
service organizations who received psychosocial support services in the last 3 months increased
significantly from 75.9 percent in 2003 to 86.3 percent in 2006. The percentage of PLWHAs
registered with service organizations who reported consistent use of condoms in the last 12
months increased significantly from 44.5 percent in 2003 to 54.5 percent in 2006. The percentage
of PLWHAs registered with service organizations who received material support in the last 3
months increased significantly from 13.4 percent to 41.8 percent.

There has been a subtle increase in all indicators for care and support for orphans and vulnerable
children although the coverage is still under 25 percent. The percentage of school going-age (6-
18 years) orphans who have received educational support in the last one year has increased
significantly from 14.2 percent in 2003 to 22.1 percent in 2006 while those who attended for at
least 5 days in the last week did not decrease significantly from 71.6 percent to 71.1 percent. The
percentage of orphans who have received psychosocial support the last one-month did change
significantly but increased slightly from 10.8 percent in 2003 to 12.6 percent in 2006. The
percentage of orphans who received material support in the last 3 months increased significantly
though slightly from 5.3 percent in 2003 to 9.1 percent in 2006 and the percentage of orphans
who received food support in the last one month also increased significantly from 2.4 percent to
7.1 percent. The percentage of orphans who know where to go when their rights are violated was
not assessed in 2003 but in 2006 and the findings 98.2 percent were aware as to where to go.

(iii) Strengthen the national capacity to respond to the epidemic. By September 31st 2006, there
were 30 districts were executing multisectoral HIV/AIDS operational plans supported by UACP
and within the 30 districts, 3,627 CHAI groups had been supported by UACP thereby providing
educational support to 301,129 orphans and home based care to 33,309 persons living with
HIV/AIDS while 15 line ministries had been supported to implement workplace programs and 38
National level and 233 District level CSOs were supported to carry out HIV/AIDS interventions.
All 30 districts supported by UACP have had LQAS surveys in the past 5 years and the
information obtained during the survey was used for district HIV/AIDS programme planning.
UACP supported 5 sectors to develop HIV/AIDS policies, develop or review their strategic plans
and to produce guidelines for mainstreaming (Education, Agriculture, Works, Gender and Public
Service).

UACP funded training of over 1000 personnel from district local governments as well as district
level CSOs in strategic planning; 184 Community Development Officers (CDOs) from the 30
districts to serve as trainers of trainers to train Community Development Assistants (CDAs) in
the districts and backstop DAC and CSOs in monitoring all district community HIV/AIDS
initiatives including CHAIs UACP is also funded training of 564 CDAs from 30 districts to
strengthen the Lower Local Government capacity for mobilising community based initiatives


                                                                                                38

using PRA techniques and providing technical support to Community based initiatives; 450
district level government and non-government service providers from 30 districts in LQAS. The
training was practical in that it involved carrying out the LQAS survey immediately after
orientation and subsequently tabular analysis of the data and report presentation. The benchmark
data obtained was used for planning and will be used for monitoring the District HIV/AIDS
program. In addition, UACP funded: Training of 227 district health personnel from 4 districts in
the use of the new HMIS that incorporates more HIV/AIDS indicators; 78 district personnel from
30 districts in the use of database for HIV/AIDS data collection, management and reporting;
Training on HIV/AIDS of 1172 agricultural and fisheries extension workers through the district
local governments in 30 districts as well as 1074 farmers through the Uganda Farmers
Federation.

Ratings. The outcome of the HIV/AIDS Control Project is rated as satisfactory overall, based on
moderately satisfactory outcomes in the project area in prevention, satisfactory outcomes on
mitigation and satisfactory outcomes in capacity building. The project was able to absorb over
99% of the funds within the planned project period despite an increase project value of US$ 5.5
million resulting from appreciation of the Special Drawing Rights.

Lessons
     The multisectoral response requires strong coordination mechanisms among
         implementing and development partners.
     Project planning and reporting mechanisms need to be well defined so as to fit into the
         existing planning needs of the supported sectors.
     Capacity building is crucial for all levels when supporting a multisectoral response.
     HIV/AIDS mainstreaming is a crucial strategy in the efforts to sustain the sector's role in
         HIV prevention and control.
     The participatory approach used in the strategic planning process promoted ownership of
         the strategic plan, built capacity and improved skills in strategic planning.
     Districts sometimes tend to look at Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) as competitors
         and vice versa in the HIV/AIDS response other than partners.
     LQAS surveys provided useful benchmark information for district level HIV/AIDS
         planning and monitoring.
     There is a strong sense of ownership of community subproject initiatives among
         members of the best performing groups as evidenced by their devotion and willingness
         to sacrifice their meagre resources (manual labour, time and finances) to the groups'
         causes.
     The CHAIs interventions are extremely appropriate in addressing the urgent needs of the
         communities in HIV/AIDS prevention and mitigation.
     CHAI subprojects have made substantial contribution in producing the desired outcomes
         and meeting overall objectives of HIV/AIDS prevention and mitigation.
     It is feasible to replicate the CHAI model including design and implementation because
         CHAI strategy has put communities at the centre of action.
     Some of the CHAIs sub-projects interventions and activities in HIV/AIDS mitigation
         and prevention can be broadly and deeply scaled up.
     HIV/AIDS resources can be channelled directly to communities.
     CHAI is efficient in that most of the resources go towards interventions and learning by
         doing enables quick capacity building for communities to address needs.
