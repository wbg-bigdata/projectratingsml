APPRAISAL OF THE NATIONAL IRRIGATION SYSTEMS IMPROVEMENT PROJECT: II
1. BACKGROUND
1.01      The main thrust of the National Irrigation Administration's (NIA)
program of rehabilitation and expansion has been directed to the large rice
growing irrigation systems in Central Luzon and in the Cagayan Valley of
Northern Luzon. The ADB-assisted Angat-Magat project and the Bank-assisted
Pampanga, Penaranda, Tarlac, Magat and Chico projects were all components
of the NIA program of development of large-scale systems in the principal
grain producing areas of Luzon. At the same time, NIA has been carrying
out a smaller, but steady irrigation development program of some 55,000 ha
in Mindanao with ADB assistance. In addition to rehabilitation of existing
canals and structures, the construction of new ones, the provision of
better drainage and access and the introduction of water management and
rotational irrigation practices, the program also has included the provision
of extra water supplies in some areas through the construction of storage
or by transbasin diversion.
1.02      NIA has not neglected the need for rehabilitation and upgrading
of the badly deteriorated, smaller systems scattered through the Philippines.
The National Irrigation Systems Improvement Study (NISIS) was set up in
1975 with Bank assistance (Loan 1080-PH) to inventory the smaller systems
and to select a total of about 150,000 ha with the highest priority for
improvement, allowing for a balanced regional distribution. All national
systems were inventoried. Systems included in ongoing projects were excluded,
as were systems earmarked for rehabilitation under already identified ADB-,
Bank- or bilaterally-assisted projects. The remaining systems were then
evaluated on the basis of the degree of need for improvement, the potential
for improvement and expansion in terms of land and water resources, the
technical and economic feasibility of improvement, the human need in the
area, in terms of poverty and disease, and the institution building aspects
in terms of strengthening the capabilities of NIA's regional offices. Sixty-
two national irrigation systems grouped into four packages were selected,
and feasibility studies were undertaken by NIA with the assistance of consul-
tants. The first package making up the National Irrigation Systems Improve-
ment Project:I (NISIP:I, Loan 1414-PH), covers 22 existing and 3 new irrigation
systems for a total 49,500 ha. The proposed project consists of the second
and part of the third packages. It would include 26 existing irrigation
systems spread over seven NIA Regions in Southern Luzon, the Western Visayas
and Mindanao. NISIP: I loan became effective in August 1977, so the Project
is in the initial phase of organization and mobilization, however the progress
to date is good and ahead of appraisal schedule. NISIP: II components are
identical to NISIP:I except the extent of drainage works for Schistosomiasis
Control Program, which is confined to the concerned irrigation system boundaries
instead of watershed area (para. 3.23) and the provision of input/output
monitoring, which would cover both projects.

1.03      The proposed project would be the ninth Bank-assisted irrigation
-roject in the Philippines. ALl works have been substantially completed on the
first project, the Upper Pampanga River Irrigation (Loan 637-PH).  Overall
progress on all these projects has been generally satisfactory. Total cost
of project on the first two projects was about 70% over appraisal estimates on
UPRP (Loan 637-PH) and about 55% higher on Aurora-Penaranda Irrigation
(Loan 984-Credit 472-PH) largely as a result of rapid inflation following the
oil price increases in late 1973. However, due to considerable increase in
the projected world market price of rice and from early diversions on both of
these projects, the rates of return on both of these projects have not
changed.
2. THE PROJECT AREA
General
2.01       The project would rehabilitate and expand 26 existing irrigation
systems with a total irrigable area of 80,900 ha. These systems can be
divided into three distinct subproject areas. The Southern Luzon subproject
would include 12 irrigation systems located in the provinces of Quezon,
Batangas, Camarines Norte, Albay and Sorsogon. The Western Visayas sub-
project, would include 4 irrigation systems located in the provinces of
Aklan, Antique and Negros Occidental. The Mindanao subproject would
include 10 systems located in the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Surigao
del Sur, Bukidnon, Davao del Sur, North Cotabato and South Cotabato.
Aside from 6,400 ha of sugarcane in the Western Visayas subproject and a
small area in the Mindanao subproject transplanted rice, whether irrigated
or rainfed, is presently the malin crop in the project area. Negros island
in the Western Visayas is the only rice deficit area, while all other
project systems are in rice surplus areas. Systems in the Bicol region of
Southern Luzon suffer from high population densities and small, fragmented
holdings; these subprojects and the one in Mindanao are located in some of
the poorest regions in the country.
2.02       There are a number of small towns scattered throughout the project
area. Most of the irrigation systems are located close to major commercial
centers providing banking, storage and processing facilities, as well as
supplies of inputs to the agricultural areas.  The systems in the provinces
of Sorsogon, Aklan, Surigao del Sur and Bukidnon are fairly remote from major
centers. A few project systems lack a good road network especially in Aklan
and Antique provinces in the Western Visayas subproject and Surigao del Sur
and Bukidnon in the Mindanao subproject.  However, the Government is currently
engaged in a program of road iimprovement in these areas.
Climate
2.03       The climate in the project area is tropical and monsoonal.  Warm
temperatures throughout the year allow a twelve-month growing season with
irrigation. The average annual rainfall in the three subproject areas ranges
between about 1000 and 5,400 mm, with marked differences in the rainfall

distribution pattern. The Southern Luzon and Western Visayas subproject areas
lie in the same climatic zone, the winter and spring months (Jan. - May) are
dry, while the summer and fall months are wet. There is considerable clim.,Lc
variation within the Mindanao subproject; the southern part is dry with
uniform monthly rainfall of about 80 mm throughout the year; the eastern part
is relatively dry during summer and early fall (June-Oct.), while winter and
early spring months are very wet; the central and western part is relatively
dry during winter and early spring (Dec.-Apr.), while summer and fall months
(May-Nov.) are wet. The rainfall, together with river flows in the wet
season, is generally adequate for a single rice crop except in the southern
part of Mindanao. Dry season cropping, however, entails a greater risk and
irrigation is essential to ensure a crop. The Southern Luzon subproject
areas are likely to be hit by about two typhoons per year with the highest
frequency between October and December. The systems in Western Visayas and
Mindanao subprojects are subject to an average of one typhoon every four or
five years, with October to December as the most probable period of
occurrence.
Topography, Drainage and Soils
2.04      Although the project systems are scattered in three different
geographical regions, the topographical characteristics appear to be more or
less identical. The systems in the Southern Luzon subproject are all located
in fertile coastal and interior plains. The slope of the land tends to be
from north to south-east or south-west. The slope is steeper in the northern
edges of the systems near the diversion sites, but it flattens out toward the
sea with most of the area fairly level. The systems in Western Visayas are
all situated in the coastal plain. While the land is generally flat, there
are occasional ridges. The regional topography of Mindanao is basically
rugged and mountainous. There are, however, vast flat plains in Central and
Western Mindanao where most of the systems of the Mindanao subproject are
located. Land is exceptionally flat in the Mindanao systems. Surface
drainage in the Western Visayas area is generally good. In the systems of
Southern Luzon and some areas of Western Visayas, there are some drainage
problems particularly in the immediate vicinity of the coast and special
provisions would be made to deal with them under the project. Drainage is
inadequate throughout the Mindanao subproject systems and the Bicol region of
Southern Luzon. The areas are interspersed by natural and man made swamps.
Four systems in the Mindanao subproject are known to have high incidences
of schistosomiasis. Special provisions would be made under the project to
deal with the drainage problem and the consequent disease situation.
2.05      Soils in the Southern Luzon subproject area are extremely variable,
but clay loams and loams of the San Manuel, Ligao, Castillo, Guadalupe and
Quingua series predominate. With the exception of Guadalupe clay loam which
is difficult to work, being sticky when wet and hard when dry, the other main
soil types are loose and friable, with excellent drainage and good fertility.
In the Western Visayas subproject area clays and loams of the Silay series
are by far the most common soil type. These are of recent alluvial origin,
gray to dark grayish brown, friable and loose, with a tendency to form a
hard pan and poor external and internal drainage. In the Mindanao subproject
area soils of the San Manuel and Kabacan series are dominant. The San Manuel
soils are pale or grayish brown, loose and friable with excellent drainage,



-5-
pH 6 to 7, and good fertility. The Kabacan series are dark gray to almost
black, plastic, slightly compact clays and clay loams of alluvial origin.
They are hard to work when dry and have poor internal drainage. All the
soils are suitable for rice which has grown in all three subproject areas
for many years without problems. With the exception of some limited areas
in the Mindanao subproject where potash deficiencies have been found, all
project soils are generally rich in both phosphate and potash, so that the
main emphasis in fertilizer application would be on nitrogen.
Land Tenure and Farm Size
2.06      Since 1972 the Government has pursued a program of agrarian reform
aimed at the transfer of land ownership to tenant farmers on rice and corn
lands. Presidential Decree No. 27 (PD 27), the basic legislation of the new
program, provides for the transfer to the tenant, whether sharecropper or
leaseholder, of up to 3 ha in an irrigated area and 5 ha in a rainfed area.
According to PD 27, the landlord may retain up to 7 ha if he tills the land
himself. Since there are some 2 million rice and corn farmers on about
4 million ha, of which less than 1 million ha are irrigated, there is
little prospect of achieving the 5 ha rainfed and 3 ha irrigated family
farms nation wide. The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) completed
the issue of land transfer certificates to tenants for all lands in hold-
ings over 24 ha in 1975. In November 1974, the Government decided to
proceed with the transfer of land in holdings between 24 and 7 ha. In
October 1976, the Government extended the provision of PD 27 to holdings of
less than 7 ha, belonging to landowners with more than 7 ha of other
agricultural land, or belonging to landowners with residential, commercial
or urban land from which they derive adequate incomes to support themselves.
At present it is not known how many landlords and tenants would be affected
by the new legislation.
2.07      NIA surveys show that some 56,500 farm families, of which 11,500
are landless, averaging 5.6 members for a total of about 316,000 people, live
in the project area. About 40% of the farmers are in the Mindanao subproject
area and the balance is evenly split between the other two subprojects. The
mean farm size is about 1.7 ha. There are, however, substantial differences
between subproject areas and between various systems within a subproject
area. In the Southern Luzon systems, the mean farm size is 1.3 ha, in the
Western Visayas excluding sugarcane farms 1.4 ha and with sugarcane farms
1.8 ha, and in Mindanao 2.1 ha. The farm size distribution on 80,900 ha of
project lands is as follows:
Farm size                        No. of farms    Area of farms

In the Southern Luzon systems about 75% of the farms covering 50% of the area
dLL below 1.5 ha, in the Westerm Visayas some 75% of the farms are under
1.5 ha but only account for 40% of the area, while the farm size distribution
in the Mindanao systems shows 56% of farms under 1.5 ha covering 26% of the
area.
2.08      DAR information on the land ownership and farm size distribution is
summarized in Table 2.2. There is a considerable variation in the degree
of skewness of land ownership in the subproject areas; the systems in
Southern Luzon show the least inequality, with the Western Visayas and the
Mindanao systems at the other extreme. Owner-operators accounted for 30% of
the farmers and the remainder were all tenants. The largest proportion of
owner operators is in the Mindanao systems where the largest farm sizes are
found.  The lowest proportion of owner-operators is in the Southern Luzon
systems, where the farm sizes are smaller. The Western Visayas systems
fall in the middle on both criteria. Although the Government proposes to
complete the issue of land transfer certificates under the Agrarian Reform by
the end of 1977, a more realistic target date would be end of 1978. Currently
some 30,000 ha or 41% (ranging from 18 to 37%) of the project area are
cultivated by about 13,000 owner-operators, the equivalent of 30% of the
farmers. After completion of land reform some 48,000 ha, or 65% of the
project area, will be cultivated by about 24,000 owner-operators, equivalent
to 55% of the farmers (Table 2.3). The remaining 20,000 tenant farmers would
operate under a written lease agreement.
Existing Irrigation Facilities
2.09      Approximately 53,700 ha of land in the project area fall within the
26 existing systems operated by NIA through seven regional offices. The
systems range in age from 7 to 50 years and in size from a minimum of 300 ha
for three systems in the Southern Luzon subproject to a maximum of 16,000 ha
for the Bago River System in the Western Visayas. Irrigation in the dry
season is limited to some 31,200 ha, partly because of inadequate river flows,
but mostly because of reduced canal capacities due to siltation and a lack of
on-farm distribution facilities. The systems have suffered from insufficient
maintenance due to lack of funds and equipment. They also have poor distribu-
tion networks which make it impossible for the majority of the farmers to get
water at the right time in the right amount. In addition, many systems
lack access roads and movement of inputs and produce is difficult. There are
drainage deficiencies in systems of the Southern Luzon and Mindanao subprojects
due to insufficient collector drains and inadequate outlet conditions.
Transportation
2.10      The presence of the Philippines-Japan friendship highway which
passes through Southern Luzon and Mindanao contributes largely to the
efficient movement of products and services. This national highway passes
through or close to the 12 irrigation systems of the Southern Luzon subproject,
thus interconnecting them with each other and with the provincial capital
cities of Pila, Batangas, Daet, Naga and Legazpi. A national highway along

the western coast of Negros Island passes through the Bago System and a pro-
vincial paved road links this highway to the Pangiplan system of the Western
Visayas subproject. The remaining two systems in Western Visayas are connected
to Iloilo City and each other through a coastal highway, which although
designated as national road is in poor state. Ten of the Mindanao systems
are interconnected with each other and major cities of the islands through
as provincial roads. The road network of provincial and municipal roads is
adequate in the Southern Luzon subproject. The Government has a long term
plan to upgrade some of the existing limited network of largely unpaved
provincial and municipal roads serving the subproject areas of Western
Visayas and Mindanao. The project would increase the road network density
by building additional farm roads, and O&M roads for the irrigation facilities.
3. THE PROJECT
Project Description
3.01      The project proposed for Bank financing would include:
(a)  Irrigation Development
(i)  rehabilitation of 26 existing NIA irrigation systems
serving a total area of 53,700 ha;
(ii)  construction of new irrigation, drainage and road facilities
on about 27,200 ha of currently rainfed land adjoining these
systems;
(iii) construction of a subregional headquarters building, seven new
field offices and extension of office, storage and staff
quarters facilities for eleven existing field offices; and
(iv)  procurement of vehicles and equipment.
(b) Schistosomiasis Control Program - Mindanao
(i)  improvement of existing drains and natural creeks and con-
struction of new secondary and some farm drains covering a
total area of about 22,000 ha;
(ii)  provision of project personnel and supplies to strengthen SCR's
headquarters' staff, employ and equip field teams for snail
surveys on four systems and to implement the health component
of the project;
(iii) provision of a health education program based in all schools
and health centers in 11 disease-affected municipalities;
(iv)  establishment of a diagnostic screening campaign and
chemotherapy for treatment of about 35,000 cases; and
(v)  procurement of vehicles and equipment.

The project would also make provision for strengthening the O&M capabilities
of the seven NIA Regional Offices covered by its activities; introducing
an input-output monitoring program of selected systems under NISIP: I and
NISIP: II; and initiating feasibility studies for three new irrigation
projects.
Project Works
3.02      Rehabilitation of Existing Systems.  The improvements would include
repairs to existing diversion structures and outlet works, construction
and/or enlargement of canals and drains, repairs and modification of existing,
and provision of new, water-regulating and delivery structures, and the
construction of O&M, access and farm roads. General features of the improved
irrigation systems would include additional canal structures such as checks,
turnouts and installation of gates on existing canal structures to more
effectively control water deliveries and to provide water more efficiently to
each field as needed. Constant head orifice turnouts to sublaterals, or a
water measuring and control device of an equivalent nature, would be provided
for water deliveries to rotational areas of about 50 ha. Turnouts would be
provided for each 10 ha unit from which farm ditches, constructed as part of
the project, would convey water directly to most farms. In the Mindanao
subproject area, nearly all farms would obtain water directly from a farm
ditch; in the Southern Luzon and Western Visayas subproject areas, some farms
would still receive water through their neighbors' fields. Farm drains would
convey excess water from each 10 ha unit to the main project outlet drains in
flat areas. For more steeply sloping areas, such as some Southern Luzon and
Western Visayas subproject systems, where the land gradient in the direction
of flow is in excess of 0.4%, the farms would drain from field to field, and
consequently the intensity of farm and collector secondary drains would be
somewhat lower. Canals would be unlined except for short length where the
soils are erosive. Working stations for Water Management Technicians (WMT)
would be provided for about each 500 ha of irrigated land in the project.
The stations would provide space for temporary storage and drying of paddy.
Gatekeeper quarters would be constructed at the major checks and turnouts of
main canals and diversion sites for proper, safe and effective operation.
3.03      Gravel surfaced O&M roads would be constructed on the canal banks.
Canals with a design flow greater than 5.0 cu m/sec, would be provided with
a roadway 5 m wide on both banks, if the service area is on both sides of
the canal, and on one bank where the canal serves the area on one side. Canals
with capacities between 2.0 and 5.0 cu m/sec would be provided with a 3.5 m
wide road on one bank. The roadway along waterways with capacities less than
2.0 cu m/sec and along some of the major farm ditches would be a nongravel,
2.0 m wide cycle or cart path. Access roads 5.0 m wide would also be provided
as links between the existing major roads of the area and the canal O&M
roads. These roads would also serve as farm-to-market roads. Gravel surfacing
on some of the major existing farm-to-market roads would be provided. The
surfacing of the roads would be 20 cm thick for 5.0 m wide roadways and 15 cm
thick for a 3.5 m roadways. To allow continuous passage along the O&M roads,
bridges and/or culverts across the existing drainage waterways would be



- 11 -
built. However, on major streams or rivers, the O&M roads would be connected
to existing bridges by short access roads instead of constructing expensive,
multispan bridges.
3.04      The proposed level of on-farm distribution and drainage is similar
to that being implemented in other Bank-assisted projects, and would be a
substantial improvement on the present, practically nonexistent system. Due
to smaller farm holdings, the density of farm ditches would be greater in the
Southern Luzon subproject area and the density and depth of farm drains would
be increased in four systems of the Mindanao subproject area to provide for
control of schistosomiasis. Rice has been grown in the project area for many
years and the land is reasonably level and generally well laid out so no land
leveling would be required at this stage. The landholdings are small and
somewhat fragmented in the Southern Luzon subproject, however a program of
land consolidation and boundary realignment, while desirable, is unrealistic
due to high population pressures on the land and local inheritance practices.
No boundary realignment or land consolidation would be required in the
Western Visayas and Mindanao subprojects.
3.05      Extension of Existing Systems.  All of the extension areas, except
the Ogsong system in the Southern Luzon subproject, the Sibalom-San Jose and
Pangiplan systems in the Western Visayas subproject, and the Roxas and Padada
systems in the Mindanao subproject would use existing diversion structures.
The main canal, with related structures and outlet works, would be enlarged
to carry the additional flow required for the extension areas of each system.
New distribution, drainage, access and on-farm facilities would be built
according to the standards and densities for rehabilitation works.
3.06      For the extension area of the Ogsong System in the Southern Luzon
subproject, an ogee shape diversion weir, 22 m long, with a maximum height of
1.5 m above stream bed would be constructed. The Sibalom-San Jose system in
the Western Visayas subproject is an old system built in 1926, whose main
diversion works located on the Tipulan river about 600 m upstream from its
junction with the Sibalom river consist of a trapezoidal concrete dam (170 m)
with falling shutter section (60 m), which was completely destroyed forcing
the construction of an upstream brush dam. Water shortage due to loss of
head during the dry season is the most serious problem. To solve the water
shortage at the main diversion works, it is planned to construct a new intake
at the left bank of the Sibalom river about 12 km upstream from the junction
with Tipulan river and a 12 km diversion canal between the proposed intake
and the main diversion dam. The falling shutter section at the main diversion
dam would be replaced by a concrete ogee section. The falling shutter
section of the Pangiplan system in the Western Visayas subproject would also
be replaced with a concrete ogee section about 30 m long and 1.0 m high. The
Roxas system in the Mindanao subproject is served by three diversion works,
located on the Maramag and Kuya rivers. The main diversion structure on the
Maramag river is an ogee type concrete weir, whereas the other two diversion
works on Kuya river are of brush dam type and supplement water to the main
dam through diversion canals. The project would replace one of the brush
dams with an ogee shape concrete weir to serve the extension area. Part of



- 12 -
the extension area of the Padada System in Mindanao would be served by a new
diversion weir of ogee shape about 20 m long and 1.0 m high on the Sacub
creek.
3.07      Drainage Works for Schistosomiasis Control Program.  Within the
area of high endemicity in Mindanao the drainage network would be designed to
return period. Drainage would take place in 48 hours and water depth in the
rice fields would not exceed 30 cm during the 48 hours of detention. Main
and secondary drains would be designed to carry flows at a minimum velocity
of 0.5 m/sec. Gravel surfaced (20 cm thick) O&M roads 5.0 m wide would be
constructed on one side of the main drains. Along the secondary drains the
surfaced roadways (15 cm thickness) would be 3.5 m wide. Along the upper
portion of secondary drains and along farm drains in the endemic area there
would be a 2.0 m wide nonsurfaced road.
3.08      O&M Buildings.  A subregional office would be established at Molave
in Zamboanga del Sur in Region 11, as the proposed regional office at
Zamboanga would be too far removed from the two irrigation systems of this
region. The construction of subregional facilities would include offices,
an infirmary, staff quarters, laboratory facilities, a warehouse and a
workshop for repairs and maintenance of O&M equipment. Project headquarters
buildings and other facilities would be expanded at Pila and Legazpi in
the Southern Luzon subproject, Iloilo for Western Visayas subproject and
Cotabato for the Mindanao subproject. Seven new field offices would be
constructed, which are proposed to be located in the towns of Lagnas and
Candelaria in the Southern Luzon subproject, Kalibu, San Jose and Bago in
the Western Visayas subproject and Libangan and Hagonoy in Mindanao subproject.
The existing offices, workshops and staff quarters, etc. are inadequate at
the following locations and would be expanded under the project:
(a) the field offices of the Agos, Palico, Dumacaa, Daet-Talisay-
Matongdon, Mahaba-Nasisi and Cagaycoy Systems of the Southern
Luzon subproject, located at or near the towns of Infanta,
Nasugpu, Lucena, Daet, Ligao and San Jose, respectively; and
(b) the field offices of the Salug, Roxas, Cantilan, Tingancan and
Kabacan systems of the Mindanao subproject, located in or near
the towns of Molave, Maramog, Madrid, General Santos and
Kabacan, respectively.
Water Supply, Demand and Quality
3.09      Water Supply.  All irrigation systems obtain their water supply
from one, two, three or four river sources, using their own diversion
and conveyance system. The project would not develop additional irrigation
supplies through construction of storage, but would improve and expand the
area covered by 26 existing irrigation systems. About 70% of the project
area would be supplied with water during the dry season.
3.10      Four irrigation systems in the Southern Luzon subproject area, one
system in the Western Visayas subproject area and five systems in the
Mindanao subproject area do not have any stream gauging at or near the
diversion point, and the available data on seventeen streams of the remaining
sixteen systems are discontinuous and in a few cases for short periods. For
the ten ungauged systems, the long-term flows at each diversion point were



- 13 -
developed by using the stream flow data of nearby river basins of similar
physical characteristics and adjusting them on an area basis. Short term
streamflow data were extended back to 1948 and up to 1973 by the use of
rainfall records. The generated streamflows were found to be in reasonable
agreement with the concurrent actual streamflows wherever available. For
those systems, which have stream gauges located downstream of the diversion
point, the available streamflows were adjusted for upstream withdrawals
using the figures for the benefited area available for the period from
1966-1974.
3.11      Water Demand.  About 47,300 ha are presently under irrigated rice
cultivation in the wet season, out of which 31,200 ha are cropped to rice
during the dry season. An additional 6,400 ha are under irrigated sugar cane
cultivation. It was assumed that transplanted rice using 120-day nonphoto-
sensitive varieties in both the wet and dry seasons would remain the dominant
crop in the project. Water requirements for rice in the three subproject
areas were based on the cropping calendars shown as Figures 5.1, 5.2 and
5.3.
3.12      Rice land preparation and nursery were estimated to take 30 days
with water requirements for saturation, evaporation and percolation as
shown in Table 3.1. Flooding requirements to provide a minimum depth of
water in the field for cultivation in each season were estimated to be 20
mm immediately after transplanting, followed by additional 50 mm about two
weeks later. Field percolation losses were estimated to be 2.0 mm/day.
Evapotranspiration rates were taken to be equal to the observed Class A pan
evaporation and effective rainfall was determined from observed daily
rainfall records and allowing water depth to fluctuate with the growth of
the rice plants and limiting maximum depth to 150 mm. The overall irrigation
efficiency was estimated to be 43% in the wet season and 50% in the dry
season at full development, based on farm irrigation wastes of 40% in the
wet season and 30% in the dry season. The consumptive use of sugarcane was
assumed to be a ratio of observed monthly evaporation at Pototan, Iloilo
for the Western Visayas subproject. The following crop coefficients were
used to obtain the consumptive use for sugarcane:
State of Growth                        Crop Coefficient
Planting  -  3 months                            0.5
3-4 months                                 0.8
4-7 months                                  1.0
7-9 months                                 0.75
The effective rainfall was computed on the basis of daily rainfall records at
Pototan and soil moisture capacity assumed as 30 mm for the first two months
after planting and 50 mm for the remaining period. An overall irrigation
efficiency of 50% was used to derive diversion requirements for the sugarcane.
3.13      Seasonal and total annual diversion requirements are developed in
Table 3.1. Monthly water requirements of the three subprojects for the rice
and sugar cane crops are shown in Annex 4. Monthly water requirements and
average river flows for those systems where water supply would be a signifi-
cant constraint are shown in Table 3.2. Annual diversion requirements are

estimated to vary between subproject areas from 1.2 m to 2.5 m, of which 0.8
m to 1.5 m would be required in the dry season. The diversion requirement
for sugar cane is estimated to be 1.2 m. The size of the irrigated area for
each system was determined from simulated operation studies using synthesized
discharge records for the 25 year period 1948-73, and the estimated seasonal
water requirements for rice and sugarcane. The cropping calendar was chosen
to maximize the use of rainfall without exceeding local manpower constraints.
No use of return flow was assumed except for Tingancan irrigation system in
Mindanao. About 55,000 ha can be irrigated during the dry season in the three
subproject areas. Adequate water supply is available to meet the supplemen-
tary irrigation demand of each system during the wet season. The currently
irrigated areas and the irrigable areas selected for development under the
project are summarized below and given in detail for each system in
Table 3.3.

Although the future irrigable area for each system in the project was deter-
mined taking into account the water rights of existing users, assurances
were obtained from Government that the necessary water rights for both
existing and expanded areas would be granted to NIA and no other rights which
could adversely affect the project water supply would be granted except by
mutual agreement with the Bank.
3.14      Water Quality.  Tests of water samples from seven major streams in
the Southern Luzon subproject, five streams in the Western Visayas subproject
and three streams, in the Mindanao subproject, serving a major part of 26
existing systems, indicate good water quality with total dissolved solids

under 300 ppm. The waters are of low salinity, slightly alkaline (pH 7-8)
and free of toxic elements. All of the streams, where water samples have not
bpte-n aaaiyzed, nave been us(ed for irrigation for periods ranging from 10 to
50 years without adverse efifect on soils or crops in the project area.
Sratus of Engineering
3.15      Project planning studies, designs and estimates of the irrigation
and drainage systems and associated works were carried out by NIA with the
assistance of Sanyu Consultants Incorporated of Japan. For rehabilitation of
the existing systems, survevs were made of the main canals, major creeks and
drains and within the sample areas for secondary canals, by taking cross
sections at 20 to 50 m intervals to determine excavation quantities. Rehabil-
itation costs of the remaining laterals, drainage and on-farm facilities were
based on unit quantity estimates per hectare of each major item obtained from
sample areas applicable to a particular system for which designs were prepared.
Canal structure requirements in the rehabilitation area were determined in
the field by NIA inspectors anad costs were estimated for repairs, replacements
or additions. O&M roads were based on canal capacity and needs within the
service area and were checked in the field to ensure that adequate access to
project works would be provided. Access roads were also provided as a link
between service and existing mnajor roads. Surveys were made of the new main
canals proposed in the extension areas to determine construction quantities.
Existing 1:50,000 scale maps were used to determine lateral and drain loca-
tions and costs were based on unit quantities of a sample area within each
extension area. Requirements for structures in the extension areas were
determined according to basic irrigation design practices. Repair work on
river diversion structures was determined from field inspection of each
structure. The planning and (design of sample areas has been carried out in
sufficient detail to permit a reduction in the provision for physical contin-
gencies from 20% in NISIP:I to 15%. Sufficient investigations have been
made to ensure that suitable materials are available for construction of
canal embankments and maintenance roadways.
3.16      The topographic maps of 1:4,000 scale used in the sample area
studies were prepared by conventional ground survey methods. The topographic
maps of the service area on a scale of 1:4,000 would be prepared using recent
aerial photographs and/or conventional ground survey methods. These maps
would be used for detail planning and design of on-farm facilities for the
project area and new distribution as well as drainage systems in the extension
areas. The base maps for land classification were prepared by enlarging old
aerial photographs of 1:15,000 scale to a scale of 1:10,000.
3.17      Construction of the irrigation and drainage system would begin in
early 1979 with preconstruction activities starting in the middle of 1978
(see Figures 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3). All project works are expected to be comple-
ted by end-1983.
Strengthening of Regional O&M Capability
3.18      Three out of the eleven NIA regions were covered by NISIP:I
(Loan 1414-PH) and the proposed project would deal with an additional seven NIA
Regions 4, 5, 6 , 8, 9, 10 and 11 centered on Pila, Legazpi, Iloilo, Davao,



- 19 -
Cagayan de Oro, Cotabato and Zamboanga respectively. In addition to providing
O&M equipment necessary to adequately maintain the systems rehabilitated and
expanded under the project, funds would also be included to purchase enough
equipment to operate and maintain the remaining 19 systems, covering about
36,500 ha in the seven regions (Table 3.4). In the absence of additional
regional equipment, maintenance of the project systems would suffer by
attempting to distribute the project equipment too thinly on the ground. The
result would be a more or less rapid return to the existing situation of
badly deteriorated systems through lack of maintenance. In making provision
for regional O&M equipment requirements, account has been taken of the amount
and condition of existing equipment and of the existence within a region of
any system where O&M equipment is being provided under other on-going
externally financed projects. The new subregional office at Mlolave in
Region 11 which would be built under the project, would also control the
Rugnan, Maranding, M'lang and Marbel systems which are not included in
NISIP:II. Funds would also be provided under the project for about 40
study tours and training scholarships of eight to ten weeks duration in
neighboring countries with projects of a similar nature. The scholarships
would be for the benefit of NIA staff working on design, construction,
operation and maintenance of both NISIP:I and NISIP:II systems.
Input-Output Monitoring
3.19      The NIA is currently constructing and/or rehabilitating about
290,000 ha under eight Bank loans and if the proposed project is included,
this would amount to 370,000 ha and about 190,000 families. If these
projects are to be successful, when NIA has completed their construction,
besides attaining the projected cropping intensities, farmers must reach
the projected paddy yields of around 4.0 ton/ha. To do this on a sustained
basis, farmers must receive a sufficient and timely supply of farm inputs,
such as credit, seed, fertilizer, pesticide, labor, threshing and drying
facilities, and transport and marketing services. If these inputs do not
reach the farmers the success of the entire NIA irrigation program could be
threatened.
3.20      A program of input-output monitoring was established under the
Chico Irrigation Project (Loan 1227-PH) with the objectives of (a) monitor-
ing the flow and build-up of farm inputs in each project area before and
during each crop season, to give NIA sufficient warning of any shortfall
and allow it to take appropriate action; and (b) monitoring the size and
the recipients of benefit flows in each project area. This program has
been in operation in the UPRP service area for about one year, with useful
results. It would be desirable to extend this program to the systems
being rehabilitated under NISIP:I and the proposed project.
3.21      The program would be implemented in three phases.  Phase 1, during
the first year of project implementation, would cover the training of
monitoring personnel and preparation of five-year agricultural development
plans for the chosen systems. Phase 2, extending over a period of two years,
would implement monitoring procedures on the selected NISIP:I systems. The
program would be extended to cover the larger systems of NISIP:II under Phase
3 during the last three years of the implementation period.   The program

would be implemented under the direction of the Agricultural Department of
the Special Projects Organization of NIA who would coordinate closely with
the National Food and Agriculture Council (NFAC). A provision has been made
to engage individual consultants of a specialized nature to assist NIA in
both the input and output monitoring phases of the program.
Schistosomiasis Control Program
3.22      Background.  Mindanao is one of the schistosomiasis endemic regions
in the Philippines, with four out of the ten systems included in the Mindanao
subproject being affected. Much of the land within these systems is near sea
level elevation and there are large areas of permanently inundated swamp.
The mean annual rainfall is about 2,100 mm, but even in January, the driest
month in the year, rainfall averages 100 mm. The combination of sustained
rainfall, flat relief and poor drainage provides a particularly suitable
habitat to the snail vector of the disease. The endemic area within and
around the four irrigation systems contains 11 municipalities and a total
population of about 140,000 people. The estimated number of persons infected
with the disease is 53,000, for an average infection rate of 22%. The
highest prevalence rates are found in the seven towns of the Salug valley
with a population of about 100,000 and an estimated mean prevalence rate of
35%. The irrigation systems to be rehabilitated and/or expanded under the
project involve some of the areas with the highest incidence of the disease.
3.23.     The Proposed Control Program.  It is essential that the proposed
upgrading, expansion and intensification of irrigation in the endemic areas
should not worsen the disease situation by creation of new snail habitats.
The Leyte subproject of NISIP:I includes a comprehensive program of drainage
works and drainage maintenance to ensure that all irrigation water and
field run off would remain channelled. In Leyte the drainage program covers
the entire watershed area and is not confined to the irrigated service areas.
A similar approach in the Mindanao subproject area would be very expensive,
as four separate watersheds would be involved and the proportion of total
area to be drained in relation to irrigated areas and affected population
would be very high. For the affected Ilindanao irrigation systems it is
proposed to draw up a full watershed drainage plan along similar lines as in
Leyte, but to implement the plan initially only within the boundaries of the
irrigation service areas. This would ensure a minimization of exposure to
the snails within the systems, while allowing for a later extension of the
drainage works should results both in the Leyte and the service area indicate
it was essential. Implementation of the additional drainage works required
for snail control at the same time that the systems are rehabilitated, would
also be less expensive and disruptive than having to come in at a later date
to do the work after rehabilitation is completed.
3.24      Health Aspects.  The Schistosomiasis Control and Research Service
(SCRS) of the Department of Health (DOH) which is responsible for monitoring
and control of the disease in the affected area, is understaffed and lacks
adequate logistical support facilities. The project would provide field labs,
equipment and vehicles and increased personnel. Four control teams would
be established, one for each of the affected systems. Each team would be
based on a field lab and headed by a parasitologist and would include a



- 22 -
malacologist and a sanitary engineer, the remaining staff would be techni-
cians and laborers. The teams would be responsible for snail and disease
prevalence surveys and would liaise closely with NIA survey and design
personnel to ensure that the drainage plan is drawn up with up to date
malacological and disease data. Provision would also be made under the
project for a health education campaign, based primarily on the schools and
barrio health centers, to alert the population to the dangers of the
disease, and to supply information on prevention and treatment. While
existing drugs do not lend themselves to a mass chemotherapy campaign, a
drug currently being tested in the Philippines shows considerable promise
in this respect, and provision would be made in the project for treatment
of about 35,000 people, or about two thirds of the number estimated to be
affected by the disease. This is considered a realistic estimate of poten-
tial acceptors of treatment over the period of project implementation.
Feasibility Studies
3.25      For the last few years, NIA with World Bank and Asian Development
Bank (ADB) assistance has been involved in the development of comprehensive
irrigation plans throughout the Philippines. World Bank assisted studies
include the Central Luzon Irrigation Development Plan (Loan/Credit 984/472-PH),
a groundwater development program (Loan 1080-PH), and the Jalaur Stage II
project (Loan 1367-PH), while the ADB has assisted the Mindanao Irrigation
Study. These investigations have identified a number of multiple purpose
projects, many of which, especially those with storage potential, show a
preliminary rate of return as high as 25%. The Government has requested Bank
financial assistance in the preparation of feasibility grade studies for
projects to be selected by the Government. The selection would be based on
Government priorities within the sector, and would be subject to the Bank's
review. Detailed terms of reference for consulting and contractual services
for investigation of each project to be studied at the feasibility level or
designed for implementation would be submitted to the Bank before any of
these studies are undertaken. It is estimated that about three projects
involving from 50,000 to 80,000 ha of irrigated area would be studied, out of
which one priority project would be prepared with detailed design for imple-
mentation. Provision would be made for a total of 320 man-months of consult-
ing services to assist NIA at an overall rate of $7,800 per man-month, on the
basis of an average requirement of 75 man-months per feasibility study and 95
man-months for the preparation of detailed design. Provision would also be
made for surveys, mapping, geophysical and detailed geologic studies to be
carried out by contract. Assurances were obtained that NIA would prepare
terms of reference for feasibility studies of three irrigation projects to be
financed under the present loan and that it would carry out these studies
with the assistance of consultants, whenever necessary, under terms and
conditions acceptable to the Bank.
Cost Estimates
3.26      Total project costs are estimated at US$138 million, of which
US$65 million or 47% is foreign exchange. Project costs are based on
quantity estimates for feasibility designs and unit prices prevailing in the
Bank-assisted Luzon projects in mid-1976 excluding all taxes, adjusted to
conditions in the three subproject areas. Unit prices for equipment,



- 23 -
materials and supplies are based on recent quotations received by NIA. The
Government exempts NIA from paying taxes or duties for equipment, material
and services procured under foreign-assisted projects, so all the costs
exclude such taxes. NIA's costs for design and construction supervision are
included under engineering. All costs are indexed to a common level, June
1978, and this is the base cost level for the project. A physical contingency
factor based on the degree of investigations completed to date was applied.
A factor of 15% was used for irrigation civil works and the health aspect of
the schistosomiasis control program. A higher factor of 20% was used for
drainage works of the Mindanao schistosomiasis control program, where the
accuracy of quantities obtained from small-scale maps was less reliable.
In view of this, NIA would be asked to submit detailed designs and revised
cost estimates for Bank review before implementation of these works. A
contingency of 10% was used for the O&M facilities. Costs due to expected
price increases over the implementation period amount to about 32% of the
base cost plus physical contingencies, assuming the following annual inflation
rates:

Financing
3.28      The proposed Bank loan of US$65 million would finance the full
foreign exchange cost of the project. It would cover 46% of total project
costs. The Government would provide the remaining P-- 555 million (US$75 mil-
lion) to NIA and to the Department of Health for the Schistosomiasis Control
Service from annual budget appropriations. To ensure the continuous and
timely flow of funds, assurances were obtained that the Government would
cause NIA to set up a special fund to service the project, which would be
replenished by the Government at monthly intervals to a level equivalent to
the estimated requirement for the next two months, which would be a condition
of effectiveness of the loan.
Procurement
3.29      Equipment, vehicles, spare parts and supplies for force account
construction, O&M for the project areas, strengthening of regional O&M
capability, input-output monitoring and the schistosomiasis control program,
costing about US$18.6 million, would be procured after international competi-
tive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. A preference limited
to 15% of the c.i.f. price of imported goods, or the customs duty, whichever
is lower would be extended to local manufacturers in the evaluation of bids.
Local procurement practices are appropriate for off-the-shelf items costing
less than US$10,000 each because the advantages of international competitive
bidding would be clearly outweighed by the administrative costs involved.
The total cost of such items would not exceed US$300,000. Bank staff have
reviewed the local procedures and they are acceptable. There is adequate
competition and foreign firms can participate. A list of equipment require-
ments is given in Annex 1.
3.30      Civil works on the project service area (US$73.0 million) would be
scattered over 26 separate locations in seven different regions. They would
include rehabilitation of 53,700 ha, extension of facilities for 27,200 ha,
main and secondary drains for the schistosomiasis control program and 0&M
buildings. These works have to be planned and executed on short notice to
avoid the growing season and bad weather and would have to be phased with
irrigation releases, and would therefore not be suitable for international
competitive bidding. In the past, NIA experienced considerable difficulty in
attracting bids for such works. Over the last three years several steps have
been taken on Bank-assisted projects to strengthen local contractors, includ-
ing financing of reconditioned equipment and providing mobilization allowances,
as a result of which there has been an encouraging response on the recent
bids. However, it is doubtful that all civil works could be done by contract
and some of them would therefore be carried out on force account. Neverthe-
less, in light of NIA's large work program in the years ahead, it would not
be desirable to expand its force account work too rapidly. In previous
Bank-assisted irrigation projects outside of Central Luzon the amount of
civil works done by force account was set at 40% of total cost, as this was
found to provide the optimum combination of force account and contract work.



- 28 -
During negotiations NIA pointed out that it had had great difficulties in
attracting contractors for the ADB-assisted projects in Mindanao. Since
the civil works in the Mindanao subproject would account for about 50% of
the total civil works cost, it was agreed to set the amount of civil works
done by force account at 65% of total cost of civil works. Competitive bidding
in accordance with local procedures is appropriate for the balance of the
work. Bank staff have reviewed the local procedures and they are acceptable.
There is potentially adequate compensation and foreign firms can participate.
Disbursements
3.31      Disbursements would be made at the rate of 100% of the foreign
exchange cost of directly imported equipment, and 100% of the ex-factory
price of locally manufactured equipment and 65% for imported equipment
procured locally. Disbursements for civil works would be 30% of certified
monthly progress payments or expenditures. Disbursements for force account
works would be made against certificates of expenditure, the documentation for
which would not be submitted to the Bank for review, but would be retained
by the borrower and made available for inspection by the Bank's supervision
missions. For civil works contractors' mobilization and equipment, disburse-
ment would be at 100% of foreign exchange cost. For costs of consultants
and technical assistance, disbursements would be at the rate of 100% of total
cost.
3.32      Disbursement of the Bank loan would be against import documentation,
contracts and certified records of payment or expenditure. It is expected
that disbursements would be completed by December 31, 1984, approximately one
year after the end of construction. In construction with the Bank, savings
under the project would be used to finance similar additional work in the
project area. An estimated schedule of expenditures, a semi-annual disburse-
*ment schedule and a proposed allocation of loan proceeds are given in Annex 1.
Accounts and Audit
3.33      The NIA and the SCRS are Government agencies and their accounts are
audited annually by Government's Commission on Audit. Assurances were
obtained that these agencies would maintain separate accounts for the project
and that after audit by the Commission on Audit, the project accounts,
together with the auditor's comments and opinion on the certification of
expenditure for force account work, would be sent to the Bank within six
months of the close of each financial year.
Environmental Effects
3.34      In all three subproject areas malaria is effectively controlled by
a Government program of house spraying with residual insecticides. The
principal health problems in all three areas are protein deficiencies in
small children, enteric diseases and tuberculosis. The proposed project
would have little impact on these. The project would have a beneficial
effect on the schistosomiasis-infested areas of the four systems in Mindanao
as a result of the proposed control program.

4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Project Management
4.01      NIA was created in 1974 and given responsibility for developing,
operating and maintaining all national irrigation systems in the Philippines.
The Government finances NIA through the sale of bonds or from appropriations.
A board of directors is responsible for the agency and the Administrator,
who is appointed by the President of the Philippines, handles management.
NIA has recently been reorganized to better deal with the requirements of
the Government's policy of irrigation development. The integration of the
major foreign-assisted projects under a Special Projects Organization (SPO)
headed by an Assistant Administrator was one of the first results of the
reorganization. Even before establishment of the SPO, most of the foreign-
assisted projects were not implemented by the regular NIA field offices, but
were entrusted to ad hoc project offices specially created for the purpose.
The regional field offices have suffered in terms of access to funds, staff
and equipment, compared to the various special project offices. The proposed
project, covering a large number of small systems scattered over a wide
area, would not lend itself to implementation by a special project office,
but would be suitable for execution by NIA's field offices. The project
would be the second major foreign-assisted project to be implemented by the
regional offices and would help to strengthen their construction, operations
and maintenance capabilities.
4.02      The Assistant Administrator for Engineering and Operations is
responsible to the Administrator for the eleven regional NIA offices covering
the Philippines. In headquarters there are a number of support departments
headed by directors. These departments are represented at the regional level
by divisions with similar functions. The regional offices are headed by
regional directors who are responsible for all NIA activities in the provinces
constituting their regions, except for projects assigned to the SPO (Fig. 4.1).
NIA has appointed a Project Director for NISIP:I, based in Manila, to be
directly responsible for execution of the project under the overall supervision
of the Assistant Administrator for Engineering and Operations. The Project
Director, with a small support staff, has day-to-day responsibility for coordi-
nating the work at headquarters of the three NIA departments with significant
roles in project implementation. He would also assume responsibilities for
NISIP:II. Execution at the field level would be under the immediate control
of the Regional Directors of Regions 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11. To assist the
Project Director, two project coordinators would be appointed, one of whom
would be responsible for the NISIP:I Project as well as the NISIP:II systems
in Regions 4 and 5. The second coordinator would be responsible for the
remaining NISIP:II systems in Regions 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11 (Fig. 4.2).
4.03      The technical responsibility for operating and maintaining all the
project systems would be with the Operations Department in the central office
and the Operations Divisions at the regional level. At the end of construction,
the field offices would become irrigation districts, which in turn would be
subdivided into irrigation divisions of about 2,500 ha. The division would
be controlled by a supervisor and would be subdivided into 500 ha units, each
under a Water Management Technician (WMT). The smallest organizational entity
would be made of two 50 ha units under a ditchtender (Fig. 4.3).



- 30 -
4.04      At completion of construction, about 156 WMTs would be required.
Most of the technicians would be agricultural or agricultural engineering
graduates. NIA proposes to reserve up to 15% of WMT posts as an incentive
for competent and experienced ditchtenders. All WMTs, whether directly
recruited or promoted to the post, would undergo a one-year training program
in water management, crop production and farmer organization at one of the
four training centers being run by the SPO.
4.05      The Schistosomiasis Control Council (SCC), of the Department of
Health (DOH) would be responsible for implementating the public health
aspects of control program under the project. The NIA Administrator is a
member of the SCC, and NIA would be responsible for all engineering and
procurement aspects of the schistosomiasis control program in the Mindanao
subproject area. Assurances were obtained that NIA and DOH would enter
into a formal agreement acceptable to the Bank for implementation of the
schistosomiasis control program by June 30, 1978.
Agricultural Supporting Services
4.06      Extension.  The National Food and Agriculture Council (NFAC) is
responsible for coordinating all agencies concerned with production of food
crops and is the body overseeing the implementation of the Government's
Masagana campaign for increased rice production. The Council operates
through provincial and municipal action committees, which would perform all
the necessary coordinating functions for the various irrigation systems
within the project area. The number of farmers per extension worker averages
between 200 and 250 in the project systems. The technicians are all graduates
and come mainly from the Bureau of Agricultural Extension (BAE) and the
Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI) of the Department of Agriculture. The water
management staff (para. 4.04) would be additional to the existing extension
personnel provided by the various Government agencies.
4.07      Research.  In addition to the central research facilities provided
by the International Rice Research Institute and the College of Agriculture
of the University of the Philippines at Los Banos, there are a number of
rice research stations operated by the BPI in the project area. The
Southern Luzon subproject is serviced by experimental stations at Daet,
Pili and Guinobatan; the Western Visayas subproject by stations at La
Carlota and Hanungaya; and the Mindanao subproject by stations at San
Francisco, Midsayap, Carmen, Amas and Davao. The main emphasis of the work
on rice in these stations is on varietal screening, foundation seed production
and certification, fertilizer trials and increased land utilization through
multiple cropping. Research on sugarcane is carried out by the Philippines
Sugar Institute (Philsugin), which has a station at La Granja serving the
Bago system in the Western Visayas subproject. Research is carried out on
varieties, soils and fertilizers, farm engineering and control of pests and
diseases. The station also has a laboratory doing research on sugar and
its by-products.
4.08      Fertilizer.  Annual consumption of fertilizer in the subproject
areas currently amounts to about 3,400 tons for Southern Luzon, 8,400 tons
for Western Visayas and 6,500 tons for Mindanao. About 55% is in the form of



- 31 -
urea and ammonium sulphate and the balance is evenly divided between ammonium
phosphate and compound formulations like 14-14-14. Application rates vary
considerably between subproject areas, being highest in Western Visayas and
lowest in Mindanao. At full development the project would require about
30,300 tons of fertilizer, of which 5,300 tons in Southern Luzon, 11,300
tons in Western Visayas and 13,700 tons in Mindanao. Urea would account
for 70% of the total requirements, triple superphosphate and muriate of
potash for 23% and 7% respectively. The potash would be used on the sugar-
cane crop and on rice in the Mindanao systems, where a light application of
the nutrient is recommended. In terms of nutrients the average application
per crop season for rice would be about 65 kg/ha nitrogen and 20 kg/ha
phosphoric acid. Potash would be applied at 5 kg/ha in Mindanao. For
sugar-cane the rate of application would be 165 kg/ha nitrogen, 100 kg/ha
phosphoric acid and 125 kg/ha potash. There is a good existing distribution
network for fertilizer and agrochemicals, which could handle the additional
demand.
4.09      Seed.  A total of about 9,000 tons of rice seed is used in the
three subproject areas annually. Most of the seed is obtained by retention
from the farmers' commercial production and only a small amount is purchased
from BPI - registered seed growers. At full development, the project would
use approximately 6,500 tons of rice seed per annum. As a result of improved
seed quality and water control, there would be a decrease in the existing 85
kg/ha seed rate to 50 kg/ha.  Assuming that rice seed would be renewed every
four crop seasons, the estimated annual requirement of certified seed for
the project area at full development would amount to 3,300 tons. At a
conservative seed yield estimate of 3 ton/ha and allowing a safety factor,
about 1,200 ha of certified seed production would be required to meet the
project needs, of which 600 ha in Mindanao and 300 ha in each of the other
two subproject areas. No technical difficulties are foreseen in establishing
the necessary seed growing facilities to produce the required quantity of
seed, although some organizational improvement of the existing seed growing
system would be required (para. 4.12).
4.10      Farmers' Organizations.  As part of the Agrarian Reform program,
the Government, through the Department of Local Government and Community
Development (DLGCD) is promoting the formation of pre-cooperative farmer
organizations, based on a barrio or hamlet. The organizations would serve as
channels for the inflow of technical services, credit and inputs and as
assembly points for produce intended for markets. It is hoped that these
organizations will grow into full-fledged, formally constituted cooperatives.
This approach to cooperative organization fits in well with the 50 ha
irrigation unit approach by NIA on Bank-assisted irrigation projects.
4.11      Credit.  The increase in irrigated area, higher cropping intensity
and better farming practices resulting from the project would require an
increase in production credit. Under the Agrarian Reform and Masagana
programs the Government has strengthened the credit institutions and eased
credit to small farmers, previously dependent on the landlords and private
lenders for their requirements. A system of "supervised credit" is used which
includes the provision of technical services to the borrower to ensure that



32 -
recommended practices, such as variety, fertilizer and agrochemical inputs,
are adopted. Under the system no collateral is required. At full project
development the annual credit requirement for all three subproject areas
would total P 123.6 million (US$16.7 million), of which E 70.8 million
would be for the wet-season crop and P 52.8 million for the dry-season
crop. There has recently been a very sharp curtailment of officially
sponsored production credit following on the poor repayment of previous
loans. Credits granted under the latest phase of the Masagana campaign
amounted to only 5% of the total issued under the first phase in 1973 and
covered less than 20,000 ha, compared to over 620,000 ha in Phase I.
4.12      The recent slowdown in the Masagana "supervised credit" program
and the lack of alternative credit arrangements could have serious repercus-
sions on rice production throughout the Philippines. The Government is
aware of this and has a number of studies under way to seek ways of over-
coming the current difficulties. The Presidential Committee of Agricultural
Credit (PCAC) with its working group, the Technical Board on Agricultural
Credit (TBAC), is now studying the problem. However, the ongoing studies
are focussed on credit and do not address the other aspects of agricultural
supporting services including provision of extension, fertilizer, seed,
crop protection etc. Recent information from the UPRP Project has shown
deficiencies in the quality of agricultural supporting services provided
to the farmers. At the Government's request, a Bank mission visited the
Philippines in February 1978 to assist the Department of Agriculture to
prepare a comprehensive program for strengthening supporting agricultural
services. Particular attention is being focused during this exercise on the
needs of irrigation systems. Assurances were obtained that the Government
would cause the Department of Agriculture and NIA to prepare a plan of action
by June 30, 1979 for the provision of effective agricultural supporting
services on the Bank-assisted irrigation projects, and, after reviewing such
plan of action with the Bank, would proceed with its implementation by
January 1, 1980.
5. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
Present Cropping Pattern
5.01      In most of the project systems the first or wet-season rice crop
starts in April/May and harvesting takes place in September/October. The
second, or dry season rice crop extends between November/December and March/
April.  While a majority of the farmers adhere to these timetables, there
is considerable slippage and all stages of crop production may be going on
simultaneously in the irrigated areas.  All rice is transplanted from field
nurseries onto previously puddled land. For sugarcane the main planting
season begins in November and continues to March.  Harvesting is carried out
throughout the year with an emphasis on the dryer period between February and
mid-May. Almost all of the irrigated land in the three subproject areas is
planted with improved rice varieties. Even in the rainfed crop the proportion
of land under high yielding varieties ranges from 85 to 95%, with systems in
the Western Visayas subproject showing the highest use.



- 33 -
Future Cropping Patterns
5.02      In the absence of the project there would be no significant change
in cropping patterns. Under the project some 74,000 ha of rice land would be
provided with wet-season irrigation, of which 27,200 ha are currently rainfed.
Improved facilities in the irrigation systems and better water management
would allow dry-season cropping of rice to increase from the current
31,200 ha to 55,100 ha. Overall cropping intensity would rise from the
present 139% to 173%. The biggest change in cropping pattern would take
place in the Mindanao subproject because over 40% of the currently rainfed
land to be irrigated under the project is located there.
Yields and Production
5.03      In the absence of the project, the rate of increase in rice
yields in the rainfed areas is estimated at about 0.7% per annum, while in
the irrigated areas yields are estimated to rise by 0.8% per annum. Yield
increases would be due to some improvements in inputs, which would tend to
be offset on the irrigated areas by the continued deterioration of the
irrigation/drainage works. Greatly improved water control as a result of
the project, together with adequate supplies of credit and inputs and
better extension service support, would raise yields of both rice and
sugarcane. Present paddy yields are shown in Table 5.1. Projected yield
levels are being attained by progressive farmers with good irrigation
facilities.
5.04      As a result of the project rice production would increase from
about 234,000 tons of paddy at present to an estimated 516,000 tons at full
development in 1988. (Table 5.2) Sugarcane production would rise from
416,000 tons to 486,000 tons.

Cropping Calendar
5.05      To ensure efficient utilization of resources and the avoidance of
technical and organizational bottlenecks, cropping calendars must be prepared
as a basis for extension and water management activities. Figures 5.1, 5.2
and 5.3 show provisional calendars for the Southern Luzon, Western Visayas
and Mindanao subproject areas respectively. The main changes from existing
cropping calendars are in some acceleration of operations necessitated by
higher cropping intensities and to take advantage of rainfall peaks at the
time of land preparation, while ensuring that harvesting and threshing take
place in the dryest conditions available. The cropping calendar for the
Southern Luzon subproject has been designed to minimize the risk of typhoon
damage. All the calendars allow for a 30-day period for system maintenance.
There would be no change in the existing timing of operations for sugarcane.
Farm Mechanization
5.06      At present, between 60 and 80% of the rainfed rice areas depend
entirely on animal-drawn equipment for land preparation. In irrigated areas
machinery is used for land preparation on about 30-45% of the area cultivated
in both wet and dry season crops. With better water management, improved
access to the fields, the need for tighter scheduling of operations to
maximize water use and increased cropping intensities, it is estimated that
the use of machinery would increase to about 60% of land preparation for both
wet and dry seasons in Southern Luzon and 70% in Western Visayas and Mindanao.
It is anticipated that the machinery, mostly four-wheel tractors and rotary
tillers, would be largely owned by farmers and contracted out to their



- 36 -
neighbors, as is currently the practice. All rice is harvested manually by
sickle. Threshing is done manually or by mechanical threshers. At present
threshing is entirely manual in the Western Visayas systems and only 5-15%
mechanical in the Southern Luzon systems, while in Mindanao between 50 and
60% of all rice crops are threshed mechanically. Under project conditions of
better access and improved field drainage, it is assumed that mechanical
threshing would be used on 40% of the area in Southern Luzon and Western
Visayas and on 75% of the area in Mindanao. Land preparation on 65% of the
sugar cane areas is already mechanized and the proportion is expected to rise
to 80% as a result of the project. All sugarcane harvesting is manual and
no changes are anticipated.
Drying, Storage and Processing
5.07      The bulk of threshed paddy is currently sun-dried on whatever suit-
able surfaces are available. Some of the rice mills have concrete drying
floors. Existing arrangements are adequate for the present paddy crop, but a
substantial increase in drying facilities would be required to deal with the
expected rise in production, particularly in the Mindanao subproject area.
The project would provide additional solar drying capacity attached to the
Water Management Technicians Stations and the DLGCD is currently engaged in
a program to provide every barrio with a paved area to be used for sport,
recreation and crop drying. Storage capacity within the project areas is
enough for present production, but would need to be expanded to meet the
increased yields. In addition to on-farm storage, there are public and
private sector storage facilities. The National Grains Administration (NGA)
plans to build additional storage and the private sector is expected to
follow suit to accommodate rising paddy production from the project areas.
5.08      There are about 550 privately owned rice mills and hullers in
the project area municipalities. Assuming a 200-day milling season, these
mills have an annual capacity of about 351,000 tons of paddy, compared to
the present project area annual production of about 234,000 tons. Since the
mills also cater to the needs of farmers outside the project areas, consider-
able additional milling capacity would be required. The main increase would
be in Mindanao where production in the project systems is expected to rise by
about 165%. No difficulties are expected in providing the extra milling
capacity as the private sector is enterprising and has access to capital. The
sugarcane growing areas of the project are well equipped with processing
facilities which would be able to handle the expected increase in production
at full development.
6. MARKET PROSPECTS, PRICES, FARM INCOMES AND PROJECT CHARGES
Market Prospects
6.01      Rice.  A major objective of the Government in the agricultural
sector is self-sufficiency in basic foods, especially rice and corn. A
deficit in rice, the main staple crop, has been a persistent problem for the
Philippines. Between 1963 and 1967 the Philippines imported an average of
300,000 tons of rice annually. After a short period free of imports, the



- 37 -
Government started importing again in 1971 at an annual rate of over 300,000
tons, with a peak of 456,000 tons in 1972 as a result of disastrous floods.
Three consecutive good crops in 1974 to 1976 have allowed imports to be
reduced to 55,000 tons in 1976. In 1977, the Government exported 35,000 tons
and built a supply of about 3 months. The good performance of the past three
years has been mainly due to favorable weather and irrigation development
causing a recovery in yields and an increase in the area planted. The Bank's
Philippines 1975 Basic Economic Report projects the 1985 Philippine demand
for milled rice to be 5.0 million tons, equivalent to 8.5 million tons of
paddy, including seed requirements. To meet this demand local production
would have to increase over the next decade by slightly more than 3.5% per
year and thus the incremental paddy production from the project area would be
marketed without difficulty. The incremental production from the Southern
Luzon and Mindanao subproject areas would be sold for consumption in the
Manila and Eastern Visayas markets. Incremental production from the Western
Visayas subproject would be sold for consumption in Negros Occidental, a
traditional rice importing area.
6.02      Sugar.  The Philippines has been exporting sugar for nearly a
century; sugarcane production occupies a vital position in the country's
external trade and contributed an average of 20% of total export revenues
since 1970. Local consumption has been growing at a rate of about 5% per
annum in the past decade due to population growth and increases in per
capita consumption. The sugar industry is currently facing difficulties as
a result of the decline in world prices following on the fast increase in
production and stocks which occurred in response to the high sugar prices of
1973-75. However, the Philippines Sugar Institute estimates that after a
period of stasis, production will increase by 1985 to 3.8 million tons of
sugar from a 1976 production of 2.87 million tons. Sugar production in the
project area only accounts for 1.6% of current national production and at
full development would be only 1.4% of the total estimated Philippines
production.
Prices
6.03      All farm inputs and outputs were evaluated at present and projected
1985 farm-gate prices expressed in mid-1978 constant prices. The prices for
rice, sugar and chemical fertilizers were based on the Bank's commodity
price forecasts. The price structure of rice is presented in Table 6.1.
The National Grains Authority (NGA) has been responsible for the relative
stabilization of both consumer and product prices. Through 1972 the farm-gate
support price for paddy and the domestic price for rice kept pace with
changes in the world market. Between 1972 and 1975, however, in the face of
record world market prices, the Government subsidized consumers by maintaining
a low ceiling price for domestic rice and correspondingly low farm-gate price
to farmers. The low farm-gate price was maintained by Government sales of
imported rice on the domestic market below cost. Over the past two to three
years the official support price and the world market price have been
practically the same. It is assumed that the paddy farm-gate price in future
would equal the financial cost to the Government of importing equivalent
amounts of rice. An average farm-gate price for the project area is used as
the variations between subprojects amounted to less than US$1/ton of rice.

6.05      Two farm models have been prepared for each of the three subproject
areas, showing the most prevalent size of farm in each area, representing the
present condition of a rainfed and irrigated farm and indicating how these
farms would fare in the future with the project. In the Western Visayas
subproject, a third model showing a 10 ha sugarcane farm, which would receive
supplementary irrigation under the project, is also included. All the farm
models are presented in detail in Annex 2 and summarized below.

6.06      The above farm models represent owner-operated farms, which after
completion of the land reform are expected to represent 55% of the farms --
65% of the land (para. 2.08). The remaining farms would be operated by
leaseholders and after the payment of rent, the respective annual income on
these farms would be lower by about US$300; US$400; and US$700 from that
of an owner-operated farm in Southern Luzon, Western Visayas and Mindanao.
Furthermore, at least in the initial phases of the project, some of the
owner-operators would still have to make payments for land acquired under
the land reform, and thus their income too would be less than the figures
shown above.
6.07      Assuming a household of 5.6 members and using the farm models from
para. 6.05, present per capita income in the project area ranges from a
low of US$26 on a 1.0 ha rainfed farm in Southern Luzon to a high of US$126
on a 2.0 ha irrigated farm in Mindanao. Incomes on sugarcane farms are sub-
stantially higher but they account for only a small proportion of the project
area and there are no reliable data on household size on these farms. The
Bank's estimated absolute per capita poverty level in the Philippines is
US$177 (expressed in 1978 constant price levels); about 90% or 41,000 of
the project's farm families are presently below this level. At full project
development in 1988, per capita incomes in the project area are projected to
range from a low of US$114 for a leaseholder family in Southern Luzon (the
corresponding per capita income on an owner-operated farm would be US$172) to
a high of US$341 on an owner-operated farm in Mindanao. The projected
national GNP per capita in the Philippines for 1988 is around US$600. Thus
the project would help to narrow the income gap between the various subproj-
ect areas and the national average.
Cost and Rent Recovery
6.08      NIA has the authority to collect fees from users of irrigation
systems to finance operations and to reimburse construction costs. Fees on
the national irrigation systems were set in July 1975, to the equivalent
of 2.0 cavans of paddy per ha (US$ 15/ha) in the wet season and 3.0 cavans
(US$22/ha) in the dry season, to be applied uniformly to all national irriga-
tion systems. As an exception to the uniform rate policy, the Government has
agreed to raise rates on Bank-assisted projects including the present project
to the equivalent of 3.5 cavans of paddy/ha in the wet season and 4.4 cavans
in the dry season. These rates would be reached gradually over a period of
five years from completion of construction. Rates in the UPRP have already
been raised to the equivalent of 2.5 and 3.5 cavans of paddy/ha in the wet
and dry seasons respectively.
6.09      NIA's total collection rate for the national systems was about 64% in
FY75, but fell to about 27% in FY76 after the increase in rates in July 1975.
A considerable improvement took place in FY77. NIA is currently preparing a
comprehensive plan of action for improvement of collection of water charges
for review by the Bank; the plan would also cover the project area systems.
6.10      All project charges, costs and benefits are measured at present
values discounted at 10% over the 40-year life of the project, and in terms
of mid-1978 constant prices (Table 6.4). The incremental rent recovery index

for the project as a whole is 30%. In the cost recovery analysis, US$86 mil-
lion construction costs (base cost estimate plus physical contingencies)
are charged against the project. Annual incremental O&M costs are US$13.2/ha.
The present value of construction and O&M costs, discounted at 10% is US$75 mil-
lion. At full project development, incremental project charges total
US$3.5 million per year. Discounted at 10% their net present value totals
US$17.3 million, giving a 23% cost recovery index for the project. Since
capital repayment charges are fixed in terms of paddy, no allowance was made
in the analysis for inflation. The cost recovery index is comparable to that
of other Bank-assisted irrigation projects in the Philippines. While the
project would very substantially improve farm imcomes, it is estimated that
at full development some 30,000 farm families on small rice holdings of less
than 1.5 ha, about 67% of project farm families, would remain below the
absolute poverty level in the absence of off-farm income sources. Both the
cost and rent recovery indices are virtually identical to those obtained for
the very similar NISIP: I project (Loan 1414-PH).
6.11      To ensure sound O&M practices and an equitable contribution by
beneficiaries toward recovery of project capital costs, the following
assurances, which were also agreed upon for NISIP: I, were obtained:
(a) the NIA would make annual budgetary provision to supply the
funds necessary for O&M of the project works;
(b) irrigation fees would be levied to provide NIA with sufficient
funds to ensure sound O&M practices and to contribute towards
recovery of as much as possible of the investment cost within
a reasonable period, taking into account farmers' incentives and
capacity to pay. A gradual increase in irrigation fees over a
period of five years from completion of construction to a level
equivalent to about 3.5 cavans of paddy per ha in the wet season
and 4.4 cavans in the dry season would meet the requirement;
(c)  the NIA would take all necessary actions to ensure full and prompt
collection of the irrigation fees; and
(d)  the Government and the Bank would consult annually on the adequacy
of water charges and the collection thereof.
6.12      Drainage works somewhat in excess of what is normally required for
an irrigation system would be carried out in the four systems of the Mindanao
subproject as part of the Schistosomiasis Control Program (para. 3.23). NIA
would be responsible for O&M of this additional drainage network after
completion of construction. It would be inequitable to try to recover the
O&M cost of these drainage works from water charges levied on farmers in the
irrigation systems as the Schistosomiasis Control Program would benefit a
larger population. Assurances were obtained that the Government would
provide NIA annually with sufficient funds to effectively maintain the
anti-schistosomiasis drainage work built under the project.

7. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
7.01      The proposed project would increase yields on about 80,900 ha
currently dependent on run-of-the-river irrigation and rainfed cultivation
by providing better water control, improved drainage and better agricultural
supporting services. Except for about 6,400 ha of sugarcane in the Western
Visayas subproject, rice would be the principal crop grown throughout the
project area. Approximately 45,000 farm families and 11,500 landless
laborers' families, a total of about 316,000 people, would benefit directly
from increased production and consequent employment. The project would
create a demand for an additional 4.02 million man-days of farm labor per
year equivalent to some 16,800 full-time jobs, and provide rice farmers with
increased access to markets through an improved and denser network of roads
to be built along the canals and drains.  In the Mindanao subproject area the
project would provide a campaign against schistosomiasis aimed at reducing
the disease risk for a population of 140,000 people. The project's per ha
cost of US$1,150, excluding costs due to expected price contingencies but
including the cost of improving NIA's regional capability is slightly lower
than in the NISIP:I project. The project would meet the Government's
objectives of increased food production and more balanced regional distribu-
tion of development at a capital cost of about US$3,200 per benefited farm
family. The cost of the schistomiasis component of the project would amount
to about US$230 per family in the endemic area. At full agricultural develop-
ment the project would result in rice import savings of US$48 million per year
at the forecast world market prices. After deducting the incremental cost of
imported fertilizer, chemicals and fuel, the net foreign exchange savings
would amount to about US$40 million.
7.02      Benefits.  Expected future yield and production with and without
the project are discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 presents the farm-gate
prices for inputs and outputs, based on the Bank's commodity price forecasts
for rice, sugar and chemical fertilizers. Gross returns, production costs,
net returns (without accounting for labor costs) and labor requirements per
ha are given in Annex 2. Figures 5.1 to 5.3 show the proposed cropping
calendars. Table 7.1 summarizes the foregoing information and gives the
expected benefits at full agricultural development for the three subproject
areas and for the project as a whole.
7.03      Foreign exchange.  Due to the presence of import taxes and import
quotas, the official exchange rate of US$1.00 = P 7.40 understates the value
of foreign exchange to the country. Therefore, the foreign exchange component
of the project capital cost and O&M cost, and the foreign exchange saved by
reducing rice imports was valued at a shadow exchange rate which was derived
by estimating the standard conversion factor (SCF) for the Philippines
which was about 0.90 for the three years 1972-1974.
7.04      Farm Labor.  The present labor supply in the three subproject
areas and the projected supply in 1988 are shown in Table 7.2. These esti-
mates assume 240 working days per worker per year and a monthly average of
20 days. Labor demand was computed on a monthly basis and then aggregated
to produce subproject and project data. Adequate family labor is available
to meet all requirements on rice farms up to 1.5 ha under high cropping
intensities. -Detailed information on wages actually paid within the
project area is limited. The estimated average annual market wage rate is
about P 8.00 per man-day, ranging from a low of P 7.00 to a high of P 12.00,

which was adopted as the most representative of the present financial
wage rate. The economic cost of labor at different times of the year for
each subproject area was determined by calculating the marginal opportunity
cost of farm labor (Annex 2). For the project area as a whole, the future
economic cost of farm labor would be P 43.20 million with the project at
full development and P 30.50 million without the project, or an incremen-
tal cost of P 12.70 million. This would be equivalent to pricing the
incremental employment of 4.02 million man-days per year at a shadow rate
of P 3.17 per man-day, ranging from a low of P 2.22 per man-day in the
Southern Luzon subproject, through P 3.21 per man-day in the Western
Visayas to a high of P 3.48 per man-day in the Mindanao subproject.
7.05      Investment Costs.  The total shadow priced capital cost, expressed
in mid-1978 prices, is US$86.0 million, consisting of US$20.20 million
for the Southern Luzon subproject, US$24.00 million for the Western Visayas
subproject and US$41.8 million for the Mindanao subproject. The annual
incremental O&M costs per hectare of wet season irrigated land are US$14/ha
for the Southern Luzon systems and US$13/ha for the Western Visayas and
Mindanao systems. All capital costs include physical contingencies but
exclude costs due to price increases. The subproject capital costs include
the cost of O&M equipment which would be used for the irrigation systems in
the subprojects, but does not include costs of O&M equipment, which would
be financed under the regional strengthening component of the project.
The Mindanao subproject investment costs do not include the incremental
capital costs attributable to the schistosomiasis control program
(US$5.7 million).
7.06      Development Period.  According to the project implementation
schedule, all works would be completed in time for the 1983 dry season
crop. Though some benefits, especially on the smaller systems, would
be realized long before the completion of all construction activities, for
the purpose of the economic analysis, it is conservatively assumed that
farmers would begin to grow their crops under improved conditions from the
sixth year onward and would achieve the projected full development yield
levels over five years in equal installments. The project would reach full
development in 1988.
7.07      Economic rate of return.  Using the foregoing assumptions and
discounting costs and benefits over a 40-year evaluation period, the economic
rate of return of the project is 23% (Table 7.3). Rates of return for the
individual subproject areas are 19% for Southern Luzon, 22% for Western
Visayas and 26% for Mindanao, reflecting the large amount of new irrigation
development and high increase in cropping intensity in the latter area.
Sensitivity of the rate of return was tested to cost overruns, reduction and
delay in benefits, the world market price of rice, security risks in Mindanao
and inclusion of the full schistosomiasis control program cost (Table 7.4).
The rate of return was most sensitive to decreases in projected rice yields.
7.08      Risks.  No problems of implementation are anticipated, as NIA has
had ample experience of projects of similar scope. However, a six-year
implementation period has been adopted to allow for the wide geographic
spread of the project and the fact that the staff and resources of seven NIA
regional offices would need to be mobilized and deployed. The largest

element of risk concerns the availability at the right levels and at the
right time of the entire package of agricultural supporting services. The
project is expected to attain rice yields of 4.0 ton/ha of paddy at full
development in 1988. These yields levels would not be attained in the absence
of adequate supporting services; however, the project would still have an
economic rate of return of 13% with a paddy yield as low as 3.0 ton/ha.

8. RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations, agreement with the Government was reached on
the following principal points:
(a)  the necessary water rights for both existing and expanded areas
would be granted to NIA and no other rights which could adversely
affect the project water supply would be granted except by mutual
agreement with the Bank (para. 3.13);
(b)  NIA would prepare terms of reference for feasibility studies of
three irrigation projects to be financed under the present loan
and would carry out the studies with the assistance of consultants,
whenever necessary, under terms and conditions acceptable to the
Bank (para. 3.25);



- 49 -
(c)  NIA would ensure that the aggregate amount of civil works to be
done by force account would be limited to 65%o of the total cost of
the work (para. 3.30);
(d)  NIA and SCRS would maintain separate accounts for the project and
after audit by the Government's Commission on Audit, the project
accounts, together with the auditor's comments and opinion on the
certification of expenditure for force account work, would be sent
to the Bank within six months of the close of each financial
year (para. 3.33);
(e)  NIA and DOH would enter into a formal agreement acceptable to the
Bank for implementation of the schistosomiasis control program by
June 30, 1978 (para. 4.05);
(f)  the Government would cause the Department of Agriculture in coopera-
tion with NIA to prepare a plan of action by June 30, 1979,
for provision of effective agricultural supporting services on the
Bank-assisted irrigation projects, and, after reviewing such plan
of action with the Bank, would proceed with its implementation by
January 1, 1980 (para. 4.12);
(g)  NIA would make annual budgetary provisions to supply the funds
necessary for O&M of the project works; would take all necessary
action to ensure full and prompt collection of irrigation fees;
and would gradually increase irrigation fees over a period of
five years from completion of construction to a level equivalent
to about 3.5 cavans of paddy/ha in the wet season and 4.4 cavans
in the dry season (para. 6.11);
(h)  the Government and the Bank would consult annually on the adequacy
of water charges and the collection thereof (para. 6.11); and
(i)  the Government would provide NIA annually with sufficient funds
to effectively maintain the anti-schistosomiasis drainage network
built under the project (para. 6.12).
8.02      A condition of effectiveness of the loan would be the establish-
ment by NIA of a special fund to service the project; the Government has
agreed to cause NIA to establish the fund which would be replenished by the
Government at monthly intervals to a level equivalent to the estimated
requirements for the next two months (para. 3.28).
8.03      The proposed project would be suitable for a Bank loan of
US$65.0 million for a period of 20 years including a grace period of 5
years. The borrower would be the Republic of the Philippines.
