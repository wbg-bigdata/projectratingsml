INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA FOR THE
CALCUTTA URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to India for the equivalent of US$35 million on standard
IDA terms to help finance a project in support of the 1973-76 phase of the
Cal-cu'tta Metrop6itan Dev0lo'mntuiAutho6rity'progroam fo'i rrehabiliEtaion and
improvement of basic urban facilities in the Calcutta Metropolitan District.
The Government of India would lend the proceeds of the credit to the Govern-
ment of West Bengal for 10 years at 5 percent interest per annum. The
Government of West Bengal would relend these funds to the Calcutta Metro-
politan Development Authority on the same terms.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report, "Economic Situation and Prospects of India"
(156-IN, dated May 8, 1973), was distributed to the Executive Directors on
May 2h, 1973 (R73-113). A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        The performance of the Indian economy since the inception of
economic development planning in 1950/51 can best be described as mixed.
Progress has been impressive on many fronts but disappointing on others:
the growth of the socio-economic infrastructure (transport, education,
health services, etc.) has been spectacular, but has often been achieved
at high cost and has yielded results of variable quality; many industrial
and agricultural investment schemes have been highly successful, but others
have taken excessively long to be completed and have operated well below
full capacity; in some parts of the country there have been periods of
rapid growth and change, but in others there has been stagnation and possibly
even decline.
4.       The average rate of growth of national income has only been about
3 percent per annum and with population growing at an average rate of about
2.2 percent per annum, gains in per capita income have averaged somewhat
less than 1 percent per annum. Although the distribution of income in India
is relatively even by comparison with many other countries, such a low rate
of economic growth has meant there has been little, if any, increase in the
living standards of the vast masses of the urban and rural population.
The Government has become increasingly concerned about the plight of the
lower income strata which, conservatively measured, consist of some 200
million people with less than US$60 per head per year, and in its pre-
liminary proposals for the Fifth Five-Year Plan (197h/75-1978/79) is plan-
ning to intensify its efforts to alleviate their poverty.



-2-
5.        The structure of the economy has also been slow to change.
Agricult ure remains the dominant sector, accounting for some 42 percent
of national product in the early 1970s compared wi-th around 49 percent
twenty years previously.  Despite the emphasis accorded to the industrial
0e0torl particularly in the period commencing in the mid-1950s,    the
share of output contributed by the sector has 4ncreased only marginally
over the period, and since tihe late 1960a has remained approximately
constant at a level of 23 percent. The principal change bas been the
increased contribution of the tertiary sector from some 27 percent in
1951 to 3L. percent in 1971.
6.        Undoubtedly India's most impressive achievement has been the
doubling of t1he average growth rate of productivity in foodgrain production,
But it is proving difficult to maintain the momentumn of this performance,
as evidenced by the drought-induced decline in production in 1972. Hence,
much remains to be done to consolidate the production growth in the wheat
belt and to extend it both to other areas and to other foodgrain crops,
most particularly rice.   Other crops have, in most cases, shown a slow but
fairly constant rate of productivity increase. Irrigation has played
a major part in agricultural growth in recent years and:, by reducing de-
pendence on the monsoon, has reduced variability in performance.   At present
only about helf the potentially irrigable area has been developed. Fuller
utilization of th3e existing irrigation system and thie extension of the irri-
gated area are therefore matters of the highest priority in order to meet
India's rising food needs and to protect the econonw against the vagaries
of the weather. La-nd wbich cannot be irrigated accounts for about '0 percent
of the cultivable area, and outplut from non-irrigated land will trus remrain
important and substantial beaefits remain to be realized through technical
change and investment.
7.        Performance of the industrial sector has been variable and, given
the emphasis placed on industrialization, disappointiing.  Industrial growth
averaged about 7 percent a year in the 1950S., rose to 9 percent in the
first half of the 1960s,   and then declined to around 3 percent through
the early 1970s. Tne stagnation of recent years is especially worrying.
To a large extent it was precipitated by the severe drouight of 1966 and
1967 and the accompanying general recession. But it has also been th,e
result of marry other factors.  the relatively limitea opportunities for
further import substitut'ion wThich had from the outset been at the centre
of the industrialization strategy;   the recurring bottlenecks in the pro-
duction of a num.ber of key intermediate goods such as steel and cement;
shortages of imported raw materials; and cumbersome administrative pro-
cedures. The improvement in output which occurred :in 1972, combined with
recent measures to simplify administrative controls, should lead to better
realization of India's industrial capacity and a higher rate of reinvestment.
8.        Domestic savings have fluctuated in the region of 8-10 percent
of net domestic product for the past decade.   This has been far short of
Indials resource needs and, even with substantial flows of external assist-
ance, has not permitted the investment rate to rise above 13 percent except
in a few years. More recently, as a result of the recession and a decline
im foreign assistance, the investment rate has been only about 9-11 percent.



-3-
In particular there has been a deterioration in the savings performance
of the public sector, largely due to a sharp fall in the Central Govern-
ment's current account savings despite a near doubling of tax revenues
in the 1960s. A disturbing feature of the budgetary situation has been
the expansion o! t L States' expenditures far in excess of the growth of
their own revenues. The Central Government has had to meet the resulting
deficits through budget transfers. This, combined with several other
factors (the military events and refugee relief of 1971 and 1972, and
a sharp drop in net foreign aid in 1972), has forced a massive rise in
total deficit financing.  The inflationary consequences of this and those
arising from the food and other commodity shortages have been serious,
with wbolesale prices currently rising at an annual rate of nearly 20 percent.
The budget for 1973/74 introduced measures to help curb inflation while the
Reserve Bank of India has also been intervening to control the expansion of
money supply.
9.        Ever since the balance of payments crisis of 1956/57, a shortage
of foreign exchange has constituted one of the most critical constraints
to the development of the economy. This has manifested itself in various
ways. The authorities have necessarily acted with extreme caution in their
foreign exchange management and have been left with little flexibility or
margin to accommodate special and emergency needs. The exchange control
and also, in large part, the import and industrial licensing procedures
have thus been the result of the acute foreign exchange situation. Even
though the external sector is small in relation to the national economy,
the continuing shortage of foreign exchange together with these controls
have retarded and distorted investment and the rate of utilization of
existing capacity. This is most clearly seen in the stagnation of non-
food imports: for instance, despite expansion of the economy at some
3 percent per annum, even at current prices the present level of non-food
imports is approximately the same as that of the early 1960s, and there
has been a continuing shortage of imported raw materials, spares, and
components. While exports have expanded reasonably steadily, they have
never achieved a sustained growth sufficient to make an appreciable effect
on the foreign exchange problem. Traditional items such as jute, tea,
cashew, and textiles, which are all beset with supply difficulties at home
and highly competitive or shrinking markets abroad, still constitute the
most important component of exports. And despite a rapid expansion in the
1960s, non-traditional items such as engineering goods and chemicals still
form only a small share of total exports.
10.       External assistance has played an important role in supplementing
India's domestic resources for development, especially from the late 1950s
to the end of the 1960s. But, with rising debt servJce payments and more
recently a decline in gross aid, the importance of net aid has diminished,
both as a supplement to domestic investment and as a means of financing
imports. Nevertheless, aid remains important and there are now encouraging
signs that net aid may rise somewhat in the future above its currently
extremely low level.



11.       As a result of substantial past borrowings, India's external
public debt stood at US$8.5 billion on March 31, 1972 and in the year
ending March 31, 1972 the debt service ratio was 29 percent. Annual debt
service payments are currently running at a level of around US$725 million.
This compares with a level of about US$200 million in the mid-1960s. In
order to mitigate the negative effects on growth of such a high burden of
external debt and to forestall any danger of a foreign exchange crisis,
the India Consortium from 1968/69 onwards has extended debt relief to
India. In addition, starting in the mid-1960s there has been a marked
softening in the financial terms of official assistance offered by several
major creditors, and also a shift towards program rather than project aid
in order to help meet Indiats more urgent import requirements.
12.       The Government is at present preparing the detailed sectoral
programs to be implemented in the Fifth Plan.  It is also re-examining the
overall 'nternal and external resources position as well as devising the
appropriate policies to achieve the Plan objectives. A first draft of the
complete Plan is expected to be completed later this year, with the final
document being published in March 1974.
PART II - IBNK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
13.       Since 19h9, the Bank Group has made 41 loans and 55 development
credits to India totalling US$1,179 million and US$'2,413- million (both net
of cancellations), respectively.  Of these amounts US$580 million has been
repaid and US$1,114 million is still undisbursed. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of June 30, 1973, and notes on the
exeution of on-going projects.
114.      Since 1957, IFC has made 13 commitments in India totalling
US$42.3 million, of which US$ 5.2  million has been repaid, US$ 7.4
midllion sold and US$ 6.3 million cancelled. Of the balance of US$23.4
mrillion, US$16.1 million represents loans and US$7.3 million equity.
A summary statement of IFC operations as of June 30, 1973 is also included
in Annex II (Page 2).
15.       The empnasis of Bank Group assistance to India in recent years
has been on agriculture and agriculture-related projects. This reflects
the importance of agriculture, which contributes just over 40 percent of
indiats GNP?, and the investment priorities of the Government.  Agricultural
projects will continue to form an important part of the Bank Group's program
and this year projects are raanned for agricultural credit, domestic fertilizer
production, processing facilities for special crops and for livestock develop-
ment. Special emphasis is being given to projects benefitting India's small
farmers through the IDA-supported agricultural credlit schemes and a project
to be presented later this fiscal year in suppor-t of the Government's drought-
prone areas program.



16.       The industrial sector and investments in infrastructure develop-
ment have received substantial amounts of Bank Group assistance over time,
essentially to cover the substantial foreign exchange expenditures associated
with investments in these fields. Apart from IDA credits for a number of
fertilizer projects, lending to industry in recent years has been principally
through the medium of development finance companies and industrial imports
credits. Assistance to infrastructure development has concentrated upon
the power, telecommunications,and railways sectors, and this fiscal year
a twelfth railway project is proposed.
17.       A special effort is being made to identify and prepare urban
development projects. But preparatory work has been slow on account of
the complexity of local government administration and the diversity of
assistance required. At the moment work is in progress on possible
projects in Madras and a selection of municipal centers in the State of
Uttar Pradesh. Last year a credit was approved for Bombay Water Supply
and lending for other infrastructure requirements is under consideration.
As India imports relatively few capital goods, because of domestic production
capacity, the Association should be prepared to finance the local costs of
high priority projects, such as the proposed project, in support of India's
efforts to secure a transfer of resources adequate to sustain a satisfactory
rate of growth.
18.       The Bank Group has come to contribute significantly towards the
provision of external assistance to India. In the three years 1966/67-
1968/69 the Bank Group accounted for some 17 percent of total new commit-
ments of external assistance; by the three years 1970/71-1972/73 this
had risen to 34 percent. Because of disbursement lags, however, the Bank
Giroupis share in total disbursements has risen more slowly from 14 percent
in 1966/67-1968/69 to 16 percent in 1970/71-1972/73, but it is expected
to accelerate in the future. As of March 31, 1972, the Bank Group's share
in outstanding external public debt was 19 percent. If current trends
continue as expected,thbe-Bank Group's share in the total amount outstand-
ing will rise to approximately 30 percent by 1979. Debt service payments
to the Bank Group during the year ended March 31, 1972 were 13 percent of
total debt service payments made by India. By 1979, the Bank Group's
share of total debt service is expected to be around 16 percent.
PART III - THE CALCUTTA SITUATION
Background
19.       During the early part of this century, Calcutta became the largest
city, and the principal industrial center in India, added to which it flour-
ished as the cultural center for northeast India. Despite the pre-eminence
of this great city, life was not easy for the lower income groups; nonetheless,
a reasonable level of services was available to the 2.5 million people who
lived there in the 1920s and 1930s. Then World War II and the subsequent
partition of 1947 had such an adverse effect on Calcutta's situation that it
has not yet recovered from the shock. In the 1950s and 1960s, Calcutta
suffered recurring periods of political instability which owed their origin,



-6 -
in large measure, to the economic impact of losing a major part of its hinter-
land through the creation of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and to the millions
of refugees who at various times after 19h7 moved from East Bengal into West
Berngal and whose presence overstrained services while also adding to the vast
amoun- cf unemployment.  The political instability slowed down industrial
investmnent and the mobilization of resources for urban and other public sector
projects which, in turn, only exacerbated the political and economic situation.
20.       Calcutta is the most populous urban concentration in India with
about 8.5 mllion people in 1971.1/   Calcutta has now lost to Bombay the
distinction of being the coantry's premier port and commercial center, but
it remains the center of India's mining, steel and heavy engineering industries.
Over the years, the lack of adequate investment has resulted in appallingly
low standards of housing and public services. The cholera epidemic of 1958
served to demonstrate the seriousness of these conditions, and Calcutta has
come to represent an extreme case of urban decline. Studies were initiated,
but continued political unrest meant that little was implemented. GOI re-
cognized the need for urgent action, but only after the introduction of
President's rule on the dissolution of West Bengal legislature in 1970 was
GOI in a position to intervene directly.
21.       The basic features of GOI's intervention were the setting up of
an investment program and the creation of the Calcutta Metropolitan
Development Authority (CMDA) to implement it. The program will require
nearly a decade of sustained effort to raise levels of urban services in
the Calcutta area to that of other major urban areas in India.  The present
phase of the program is geared to deal with an emergency situation and is
soundly based. At the same time, the Government of West Bengal (GOWB) has
started to take action to bring about an improvement in the operation and
financing of urban services.
The Calcutta Metropolitan District (OND)
22.       GMD stretches north and south along both sides of the Hooghly
River. The pepulation is concentrated east of t,he river with three million
living in Calcutta City surrounded by over three million or more living in
municipal and semi-urban settlements outside the ci ty limits. On the west
bank, another 1.4 million people live. Population density in Calcutta City
averages 33,000 persons per km2 compared with 15-18,000 persons per km2 in
the suburban areas.
1/   This vast urban. concentration is now more precisely called Calcutta
Metropolitan District (CMD) to distinguish it fron Calcutta City,
the municipality whose boundaries were established in the l9th
century and which covered the main commercial and older residential
areas.



- 7 -
23.       Only the center part of Calcutta City was planned, and then only
to urban requirements of the early 1900s, while the rest of the CMD has
grown in a haphazard manner with little control or foresight. Over the
past 20-25 years most of the population growth has occurred in the areas
outside the city, and more recently it has been taking place on low-lying
swampy land wbi  .- s ill suited to urban use, As a consequence, there is
a marked difference between urban services within and outside the city.
24.       GOWB is the only administrative body with jurisdiction over the
entire CMD area. The State, through its directorates, boards or commercial
undertakings, provides many of the urban services, and also provides sub-
stantial budget support for all local government units in the CMD. The
Calcutta Corporation, which has a long history of local government, together
with one other corporation, 33 municipalities and 37 town boards, share
municipal responsibilities within CMD. The Calcutta Corporation provides
a wider range of urban services, has a higher per capita revenue base and
enjoys greater autononm than the other municipal bodies, which are subject
to more control by the State Government.
The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA)
25.       The GMDA is an agency of the GCJWB, with authority to plan and
spend ounds on the development program.  It aloo has responsibility for
managing the implementation of projects within the program, some of which
it executes directly. Although not autonomous, the CMDA has more independence
than State Government Departments, especially .n repe_t of sanctioning ex-
penditures and recruiting staff. The Board comprises three State Officials
and three Municipal Officials with a State Government minister, presently
the Minister of Works and Housing, as Chairman. Substantial financial
support is received from the Center and performance is reviewed quarterly
by the Central and the State Governments. The CMDA is organized into nine
program units, four common service units, and a recently created planning
unit under the Secretary, the Chief Executive.  CMDA presently supervises
more than 150 schemes which are being carried out by 54 different executing
agencies. CMDA's control over the activities of these agencies is based on
its powers of project approval and finance.
26.       The CMDA acts as the agent of the State Government in the
administration of a consolidated development fund for the program. This
fund has been financed from the following sources: CMDA market borrowings
(35 percent), State Government loans (32 percent), Central Government loans
(16 percent), Central Government grants for slum improvement (7 percent),
and revenues derived from the "octroi tax" (10 percent), which is tax on
the movement of goods into CMD. The Central and State Governments thus
provide the bulk of the investment resources. GMDA's revenues are presently
restricted to part of the proceeds of the octroi tax, which is only sufficient
to service its market borrowings, and so CMDA is not financially autonomous.
CMDA uses these funds itself or makes them available to agencies or muni-
cipalities for execution of projects in its program, on terms decided by
GOWB,



-8-
27.       The State Planning Board has recently presented a proposal for
reorganiza-tion of local government, including financial administration,
within CMD. This proposal, which has yet to be considered by the State
Legislature, places the major responsibility for the development and
operation of metropolitan services on a single metropolitan government
with a second tier of local government comprising 23 boroughs, which would
replace the present municipalities. In May 1973, a working group was set
up by GOI in cooperation with GOWB to study the question of mobilizing
local resources to finance the operation and maintenance of projects within
the CND, and a plan for improving financial performance is scheduled to be
completed within 12 months of the date of effectiveness of this proposed credit.
28.       CMDA investment during the current Fourth Plan (1969/70-1973/74)
is estimated at US$225 million and is projected to total US$460 million in
the Fifth Plan period.  The program has been derived from the "Basic
Development Plan for Calcutta Metropolitan District 1966-68" which was
prepared on the basis of various studies carried out in the early 1960s,
with the support of the UNDP/WHO and the Ford Foundation.   It includes
schemes for improvements in drainage, sanitation, urban transport, water
supply, housing, health services and slum amenities. Priority for invest-
ment has been given to areas suffering the greatest deficiencies, with the
overall objective of establishing minimum acceptable standards throughout
CMD.  The rate of program implementation has accelerated rapidly;   expend-
itures have increased from IJS$4 million in 1970 to about US$40 million in
1971 and 1972. The program of investment visualized for the Fifth Plan
implies another substantial increase in the size of CMDA's activities.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
29.       Discussions concerning the proposed project were initiated in early
1972.     A project preparation mission visited India in July/August 1972,
and the project was appraised in November/December 1972.   Negotiations took
place in Washington from June 26 to July 9, 1973. The Borrower was repre-
sented by Mr. G. Venkataramanan, Deputy Secretary, Department of Economic
Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and Mr. S. Kumar, Deputy Secretary, Ministry
of Works, Housing and Urban Development. GCWB was represented by its
Additional Chief Secretary, Mr. B. R. Gupta. CMDA was represented by
Mr. J. C. Sengupta, Vice Chairman, Mr. K. C. Sivaramakrishnan, Secretary
and Mr. D. C. Mukherje, TDechnical Advisor. A report entitled "Appraisal
of the Calcutta Urban Development Project" (159a-IN, dated July 27, 1973)
is being circulated to the Executive Directors separately. A credit and
project summary is in Annex III to this report.



-9-
Project Description
30.       The project forms part of the CMDA US$230 million program for tbhe
period July 1973-June 1976. It comprises L4 schemes covering water supply
(8 schemes), sewerage and drainage (17), roads and traffic improvements (12),
garbage disposal (2), environmental hygiene (3), and housing and area develop-
ment (2). Technical assistance would be provided in urban planning, and the
operation and maintenance of water supply and sewerage services.
31.       The schemes have been selected with a view to their priority within
the sector and the overall program, and in particular to their functional or
geographic interrelationship as well as their state of preparation or execution.
The water supply components will contribute towards improving the distribution
of filtered water in Calcutta City and its suburbs.   The sewerage and drainage
schemes will help to reduce the effects of storm flooding during the monsoon
in Calcutta City, its northeastern suburbs, and Howral. The garbage disposal
and environmental hygiene schemes will bring 'about a more tolerable environ-
ment in Calcutta City, by providing adequate garbage collection and disposal
eouiprent, and the installation of sanitary latrines in unsewered areas. In
urban transport the thrust of the present CODA program is to increase the
capacity of existing facilities, and the schemes included in the project com-
prise extension and widening of roads, traffic operation measures, construction
of a bus terminal and extension of street lighting in Calcutta. Slum redevelop-
ment scheme will provide for rehousing in flats in Calcutta City, while a sites
and services scheme will be developed on the edge of the CMD.
32.       The following two examples illustrate the importance of this
project. First, when the rehabilitation of the Palmers Bridge and
Ballygunge pumping stations has been completed, they will be able to
handle the entire storm water load which presently floods large areas
of central Calcutta City. This water is difficult to dispose of and
extended periods of flood conditions have had an adverse effect upon
various facilities including roads, water supply and sewerage pipelines.
As a result, unsanitary conditions have often been created and have on
occasion led to the outbreak of epidemics.
33.       The second example is the Baishnabghata-Patuli sites and services
scheme about 10 km southeast from the center of Calcutta. About 130 hectares
of undeveloped land will be acquired and urban services provided, including
filtered water supply, sewerage, roads, a school and a health center for
about 30,000 people, of whom up to 25 percent will be in the low income
group. Land will be sold to middle and upper income groups for residential
purposes and to commercial and industrial enterprises and the proceeds are
expected to meet the cost of housing development for low income families
who will be provided with the frame of a house which they can then complet'e.
The scheme is expected to be the prototype for large-scale self-financing
schemes to increase the supply of housing for the low income group.



- 10 -
Responsibility for Project Execution
.kb.     The CI'DA will have overall responsibility for imnplementation of
t:re pcject as it has for implementation of the whole program.  CMDA will
thus be responsible for technical appraisal, review of cost estimates and
sanctioning of all schemes included in tne project. All works will be
carried out, with minor exceptions, by contractors, who would be supervised
either directly by CG1'A or by executing agencies unaer CMDA's supervision,
ClDA would be directly responsible for the execution of nine of the se'ected
water supply and sewerage and drainage schemes, which would account for
20 percent of the value of the infrastructure components of the project.
TIhe remaining 35 schemes will be executed under the supervision of GMA
by six agencies whose performance is considered adequate.
35.       GDA has cornpetent technical and manageriaa staff and its perform-
ance to date has been sound.  It will control the scheduling of interrelated
program elements and the procurement of scarce materials and will establish
an engineering management unit which will be responsible for the coordination
of program activities.   MDA is receiving assistance from experienced and
well qualified Indian management consultants.
Operation and Maintenance of Facilities
36.       Responsibility for the operation and maintenance of completed
schemes under the program will rest with a large number of state and local
agencies.  Schemes constructed by CMDA will be handed over when completed
to operating agencies spec'ifically designated for each project.  Ir. the
case of major water supply, sewerage and. drainage facilities, agencies
responsible for operation and maintenance will need further strengthening.
Accordingly, during negotiations it was agreed that consaltants will
develop guidelines for the organization and staffing of operation and
maintenance units in these sectors.
37.       Revenues of the municipalities are at present limited to the
property tax, which is inadequate to cover expenditures on operation and
maintenance.  Major improvements in the assessment and collection of taxes
and charges and in the devolution of revenues to responsible operating
agencies are expected to form part of the proposed reorganization of local,
government in the Metropolitan District. Preparatory work for the reorgan-
ization includes the ident:ification of costs for providing individual
services and the establishment of consumer charges after considering such
aspects as equity and ability to pay.  In the meantime, funds required for
the operation and maintenarnce of urban service facilities will be supple-
mented as necessary from the State Government budget.



Planning Support
38.       Planning support for the preparation of CMDA's program has,
hitherto, been the responsibility of the Calcutta Metropolitan Planning
Organization (CMPO). In June 1973, a decision was taken to transfer this
responsibility to CMDA. Under the proposed project, consultant assistance
to CMDA will be provided for work on water supply and traffic studies and
also on the planning of urban land development.
Project Costs and Financin
39.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$96.9 million
equivalent, including US$20.5 million of foreign exchange costs. Of the
total, US$70.7 million is for individual schemes, US$7.3 million for
project management, US$0.4 million for consultant services, and US$18.5
million for contingencies (Annex III).
40.       The proposed US$35 million IDA credit, equivalent to 36 percent
of total project cost, would cover the following project costs (including
contingencies): material and equipment, US$15.0 million; civil works,
US$19.5 million; and consultants services, US$0.5 million. The proceeds
of the credit would be passed on by GOI to GOWB at 5 percent for 10 years
conforming to the terms specified in the 1973-74 GOI budget foi-loans from
GOI to State Governments. In accordance with GOWB's standard relending
procedures for CMDA's program, the same terms of interest and maturity will
be applied when GOWB relends the proceeds of the credit to CMDA.
Procurement and Disbursement
41.       Materials and equipment valued at US$9.2 million or 10 percent
of total project costs, would be procured by CMDA on the basis of inter-
national competitive tender in accordance with the Association's guidelines.
Domestic suppliers would be accorded the usual preference of 15 percent or
the rate of customs duty, whichever is the lower. Other materials valued
at US$1h.5 million would be unsuitable for international bidding either
because fabrication should take place near the construction site or
because standardization is necessary. The items concerned are available
competitively from local suppliers.



42.       Ci`vil works to..,7-i.^.g US$85 million are unsuitable for inter-
national competitive biddi-incr because of their diverse natture, small size
and scattered location.  Civil works totalling about US$15.0 million have
alreacy been contracted on the basis of acceptable procedures.   Of the
balance of US$33.8 million., US$32 million will be tendered on the basis
of local competitive biddinr; procedures acceptable to the Association,
while the construction of s.anitary lat-rines (UL,$1.8 million) will be
undertaken by fcrce account.
43.       The Association woula disburrse against (a) 100 percent of the
cost of materials and equiip)rment p,rocured af'±er international competitive
bidding on the basis of c.i.fh _:ost for imported i-tems anel ex-factory cost
of locally purchased items2. (b) 2C4 percent of ex-factory costs of materials
an-i equipment proc-a-ued aft,-e:_ local bidding; (c) 40 percent of the costs of
civil. works (excluding l.and and p;rcject, management);  and (d) 100 percent
of the remuneration of ex>c -e s of consultants. The major part of the credit
is expected t;o be disbuised cuer three years.
Economic Benefits
414.      The prc'.ect woul,,. con-tribute towards achieving the targets of
the CIODA progracm in several sectfrs. These targets call for an increase
in psr capita water supply fi'rom 22 gallins per day at present to 42 gallons
per day in 1981.  Th11,e propr-tion of Calcuiktads population served by water-
borne sewerage will. izncrease -from 26 percer.t at oresent to 70 percent in
1981.  Investments in draiina.ge fac4laties are designed to reduce the
incident.s of floodintg by 9< ijercent between now anc 1981. Housing, area
development and slurm impro-vement progrwns wil- ooncentrate on areas with
extremely low standards of uriban servi.ces and so will ddirectly benefit
about one mill-ion persons Inthe low inlcomc group.  Indeed, the program

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION!/
Ln No. 307    Indian Iron and Steel Company US$1 9$ million loan of
December 22, 1961; Closing Pate: December 31, 1973
This loan was made in 1961 and the original closing date was
January 31, 1967. The implementation of the project has been affected by
technical and managerial difficulties connected with the opening of new
collieries to supply IISCO's steel plant. The Bank, together 'with
technical consultants, has been providing constant supervisiorn and progress
is being made in resolving the technical iesues. On the managerial side,
the Government of India announced on July 20, 1972, that it was taking over
the management of TTSCO for two years. The Government has assured us that
this action will not interfere with IISCO's obligation to the Bank. On
June 30, 1973, US$1 7 million remained undisbursed of which about US$1
million has been earmarL-ed I'or equipment on order and technical services,
while US$0.7 million may be cancelled by the closing date of December 1973.
The .Bank has approved some increase in short-term indebtedness as well as
rehabilitation progranm and has also agreed in principle to a reduction in
the Bank's mortgage cover.

These loans have supported industrialization in India through a
well-established development finance company. Loan 414-IN is in the
process of being closed and the undisbursed balance will be cancelled.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense and with the understanding that the. do

in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 4
There have been delays in disbursements on the earliest Loan 515-IN as
a result of the business slowdown in the years following 1967. The
original closing date of December 31, 1971 for 515-IN has been extended
twice to December 31, 1 973e Loan 683-IN has been fully committed as of
December 31, 1972. Disbursements under Loan 789-IN are ahead of schedule.
Loan 902-IN is not yet effective. Conditions of effectiveness are to
be fulfilled by September 9, 1973.
Cr No. 89     Beas Equipment; US$23.0 million credit of June 29, 1966;
Ctosing Date: December 31 173
The purpose of this credit is to provide part of the foreign
exchange cost of imported. equipment and services required to develop
hydro-electric poaer from the Beas River, to extend irrigation in the
Ptmjab and Rajasthan and f'or associated construction works. The project,
which Ias been subject to some delays, is part of a larger scheme for
the integrated development of the eastern rivers of the Indas Basin.
The balance of the credit outstanding is to be spent on items scheduled
for delivery up to December 31, 1973, and as a result, the original
closing date of December 31, 1972, has been postyponed by a year.
Ln No. 614    Tarai Seeds; US$13.0 million loan of June 18, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1597
This loan to the Tarai Development Corporation is to assist in
the development of seeds of high yielding varieties of crops. The Asso-
ciation has approved planis for the expansion of an existing seed processing
niant and construction of a new plant. Orders have been placed for the
equippment required for the former and tenders for equipping the latter
pLant have been readvertised following rejection of earlier bidding as
unresponsive. A major difficulty has arisen because of a lack of response
tro tenders for land-levelling. This problem is being overcome through
dez!onstrations under field conditions in the project area for contractors.
.A proposal is currently under discussion which would permit contractors
t- ,-sulrchase imported equipmen*L of their choice for land-levelling.
Ir   . biyo   615  Telecommzinicatiors III; US$27.5 million loan of june 18,
1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1973
The project, whi-ch was financed 50 percent by a Bank loan and 50
percent by an IDA credit (153-Iii, was designed to assist in financing the
t.elecomanications expansion program for the first three years of the
~4'oth Plan period (1 969-1972). Credit 153-IN ws disbursed fully three
months prior to the closing date, but the closing date for Loan 615-IN
has had to be postponed from December 31, 1972, to June 30, 1973. By this
date requests for the balance of US$40,000 had been received by the Bank
and are being processed.

Cr No. 176    Kadana Irrigation; US$35.0 million credit of February 9,
1970; Closing Date: September 30, 1976
This project will finance in part the construction of Kadana
Dam on the Mahi River, the expansion of the irrigated area below the dam,
and the resettlement of inhabitants in the reservoir area in the States
of Gujarat and Rajasthan. The project also includes canalization, land-
levelling, the construction of field channels, drainage works and roads,
and a program to support agricultural development. The project is likely
to be completed about two years behind schedule. A major problem has been
the failure of the prime contractor on the dam itself; the Government was
forced to discharge this contractor in October 1971 and to undertake the
work by departmental force account. Since that time the Public Works
Department has been making satisfactory progress. Drainage works in the
right bank area are likely to be more extensive and more costly than
expected and may not be completed until 1978.  The outlook for ot: er com-
ponents of the project remains satisfactory. As the delays in impeimenta-
tion have occurred at the start of the project, and also before major
investments had been made, both investment costs and benefits will be
deferred. Thus, the effect of these delays upon the economic rate of
return is not likely to be significant.

o:rg:nLnsl.y ex-pected, mainly due to delays in the institutional reforms
required under the projects (hiring of groundwater experts, changes in
lending criteria and te ms, etc.). These constraints have now been
overcone and the rate of cisbursement is accelerting. By June 30, 1973,
US$28!e5 million out of US$3.5 million had been disbursed under the Gujarat
project. ih all US$61 .3 million had been disbursed by Juzne 30, 1973.
Conditicns of effectiveness for Credits 391 -IN and 392-:Th have to be
fulfrilled by September 30 and October 3I, I973 respectively.
The major unresolved problem is the procurement of tractors,
which account for almost 30 percent of the credits. The imposition by
the Government of india of a 40 percent import du;ty and the realignment
of the rates of exchange of international currencies have contributed to
the delays. In the case of the Punjab credit, bid prices were distorted
to the extent that the Government had to withdraw the tender. Fresh bids
have been eva1luated and procurement is expected to start shortly. Procure-
ment ander the remaining credits has been deferred pending consideration
of a reo-uest from C-O0 that the Association shouJlcL finance indigenous as well
as imported tractors.

duction problems in local factories delayed initial disbursement by about
6-9 months. However, production has now picked up and as of June 30, 1973,
US$1 6.2 million had been disbursed under the credit. Fall disbursement
is expected by the closing date of December 1974.

village roads. With the exception of the lining of the main canal, the
project civil engineering works are generally proceeding satisfactorily,
and disbursements are ahead of schedule. After two tenders, bids for
canal-lin-ing contracts are stilli considered to be unreasonably high so
the Government of Andhra Pradesh has now decided (June 1973) to put out a
third tender.

Procurement
Arrangements:                    Equipment and material estimated to cost
US$9.2 million would be procured on the basis
of international competitive tender with
domestic bidders accorded the normal preference
of 15 percent or customs duty whichever is the
lower.  Other equipment and material valued aL
US$14.5 million unsuitable for international
procurement would be purchased locally. Civil
works valued at US$t8.8 million are of diverse
nature, small size, and scattered location and
therefore unsuitable for international competi-
tive bidding; civil works valued at US$1.8
million would be undertaken by force account.
Other works with an estimated value of US$15
million have been contracted already on the
basis of acceptable procedures, leaving a balance
of civil works amounting to US$32 million which
will be tendered locally.
Rate of Return:                     The rate of return for selected parts of the
projects covering improvements in water supply,
drainage and housing is estimated to be at least
10 percent.
Appraisal Report:                   Report No. 159a-IN dated July 27, 1973.
