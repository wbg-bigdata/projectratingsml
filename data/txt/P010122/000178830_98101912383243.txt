SRI LANKA
TREE CROP DIVERSIFICATION PROJECT (TEA) I
I. SECTOR BACKGROUND
The Agricultural Sector
1.01      The Role of Agriculture in the Economy.  Agriculture plays a major
role in Sri Lanka's economy, accounting for 37% of GDP, 55% of total employment,
about 80% of export earnings and a large share of public revenue. Approxi-
mately 80% of the country's total population lives in rural areas. Thus,
economic growth in the country depends largely upon performance in the agri-
cultural sector. During the 1960's, considerable progress was made in in-
creasing food production as GOSL pursued a firm policy of increasing food
self-sufficiency. Paddy production expanded from 840,000 tons to 1.6 M tons
(6.5%/year) as a result of area expansion (175,000 ha), increasing yields -
from 725 kg/ha to 1,050 kg/ha - and increased cropping intensity. After 1970
area expansion continued at a similar rate but yields and cropping intensity
declined so that production grew at only 0.7%/year. Major reasons for the
fall-off in productivity were farm power shortages - reflecting foreign
exchange constraints - and high fertilizer prices. However, by 1977 Sri
Lanka was 68% self-sufficient in rice compared with 50% in 1960.
1.02      While GOSL's basic policy of promoting food production was sound
the tree crop sector, which in the early 1960's accounted for over 90% of the
value of merchandise exports, has been neglected. During the 1960's production
grew at only 1% per annum, and that mainly from rubber which was benefiting
from substantial replanting in the early 1950's. Since 1970 conditions in the
tree crop sector have further deteriorated, with output of tea, rubber and
coconuts all pointing downward.  Declining quality has also been evident,
especially in the tea industry.  The disappointing production trends in the
tree crop sector were primarily a reflection of declining profitability,
associated with lower prices and high taxes, the uncertainties associated with
GOSL land reforms and inadequate foreign exchange allocations for vital inputs
such as fertilizer and spares and replacements for machinery and vehicles.
1.03       Land Reform.  The first phase of land reform, initiated in 1972,
limited private holdings to:  (i) 25 acres if exclusively paddy land or (ii)
50 acres if not exclusively paddy land, with paddy land not to exceed 25
's  acres.  In the first phase takeovers, implemented in 1973 and 1975, about
7t'- 225,000 ha of land were vested in the Land Reform Commission (LRC). Of this
-7   about 60% was under tree crops which included about 23% of the total tea
7    area, 15% of the rubber area, and about 10% of the coconut area.  The State
Plantations Corporation (SPC), under the Ministry of Plantation Industries
(MPI) was given about 40 of the larger well-maintained tea and rubber estates,
covering about 10% of the tree crop land taken over. The management of most
of the remainder was placed in the hands of cooperatives.



-2-
1.04      In the second phase, initiated in October 1975, all land owned or
possessed by Sri Lankan and foreign companies, which included the country's
major tea and rubber estates, was vested in the LRC. About 65,000 ha were
assigned to SPC and nearly 915,000 ha to the Janatha Estates Development Board
(JEDB) which was established for the purpose under the Ministry of Agriculture.
This meant, that over 60% of the tea estate land, 30% of the rubber estate
land and 10% of the coconut estate land were vested in the LRC. In late
1977 the management of much of this land was significantly rationalized.
JEDB was transferred to MPI and the Upcountry Estate Development Board and
Electorate Level Cooperatives, which had mismanaged the estates they con-
trolled, were disbanded and their estates divided between JEDB and SPC.
1.05      The Tree Crop Sector.  Within the agricultural sector the tree
crop sector plays a strategic role. It provides a major contribution to
value added in agriculture, the bulk of the country's export earnings, and a
considerable amount of employment. In 1976, tree crops, of which tea, rubber,
and coconuts are the most important, contributed Rs 2,546 M or about 29% to
Sri Lanka's total value added of agriculture and about 11% of GNP. In addi-
tion, processing of tea, rubber and coconuts added about Rs 780 M to GNP. In
the export sector, the three major tree crops accounted for about 70% of the
country's total export earnings in 1976 while tea alone accounted for 44%.
Over one million people are employed in the tree crop sector, which represents
a quarter of the total labor force and one third of the total number of people
employed. Of this labor force, 700,000 are employed in the tea sector,
200,000 in the rubber sector, and 100,000 in the predominantly smallholder
coconut sector.
1.06      The Minor Export Crop Sector.  In this sector, besides tea, rubber
and coconuts, the country produces numerous other crops, such as cinnamon,
cardamom, citronella, cashew, cocoa, pepper, cloves, nutmeg and coffee. They
are commonly referred to as minor export crops and are all, with the exception
of cashews, wet zone crops.  In 1976, about 76,000 ha were estimated to be
under minor export crops, their value added being about Rs 125 M, and pro-
viding employment for over 10,000 people.
1.07      Performance of the Tree Crop and Minor Export Crop Sector.  Perform-
ance of the tree crop sector in general has been disappointing in the 1970s
as evidenced by the declining levels of production. Over the period 1970
through 1976, production of tea fell 7.4%, rubber 0.4% and coconuts 16.6%.
Measured at 1959 constant factor prices, their contribution to GNP in 1970-76
also declined. Decline in production can be attributed to a variety of rea-
sons, including severe drought, declining profitability due to low prices and
high taxes, fragmentation of management and neglect of investment because of
nationalization and general economic stagnation, which seriously affected
the availability of vital inputs, especially of fertilizers. As one of the
most conspicuous signs of the current problems, the annual rate of replant-
ing in the tea sector dropped from about 2,800 ha in 1970 to only about 1,100
ha in 1976, while in the rubber sector it declined from about 4,100 ha to
2,000 ha. Coconut production has also met serious difficulties which have
been associated with prolonged adverse weather conditions and the fact that
production is based largely on numerous smallholdings having limited access



-3 -
to credit, inputs and extension advice. However, performance of the minor
export crop sector has been encouraging. From 1970 to 1976, mainly due to
real price increases, the value added of minor export crops increased by
about 150% in constant prices, but its contribution to GNP is still less
than 1%. This sector has substantial potential for future development.
1.08      GOSL Tree Crop Sector Strategy.  GOSL has come to realize how vital
the tree crop sector is to the economy. Efforts to streamline the organiza-
tion and management of the nationalized tea and rubber lands are underway.
GOSL is also taking positive steps to improve policies on recruitment, staff-
ing, and compensation of personnel for SPC and JEDB to promote flexible, com-
mercially-oriented business practices. To provide government with a policy
framework in the tree crop sector on sales and export taxes and on subsidies
for fertilizer and replanting a "Tree Crops Incentive Study," a component of
the Agricultural Development Project (Credit 595-CE), is presently being
undertaken. Furthermore, to formulate future policies for the Tea Industry
covering desirable production levels, organization, management, replanting,
marketing strategies, etc. an overall master plan for the tea industry, with
the assistance of the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), is
underway. Finally, in order to promote production of minor export crops,
a Department of Minor Export Crops was set up in 1973.
1.09.     To implement its rehabilitation policies (sese para 5.22) for the
tree crop sector, GOSL is formulating plans for land that should be diversi-
fied out of its present land use. The Ministry of Agriculture and Lands (MAL)
through its Agricultural Diversification Division (AD])) has been entrusted
with this task. The executing agency for these programs of rehabilitation,
diversification, and settlement of degraded lands will be the National Agri-
cultural Diversification and Settlement Authority (NADSA), which was estab-
lished early in 1978 under the State Agricultural Corporations Act of 1972.
II. PROJECT GENESIS AND OBJECTI'VES
2.01      In 1967 the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) appointed a Commission
to review the effects of a replanting program aimed at replacing old seedling
tea with high-yielding clonal material. The Commission concluded 1/ that the
program was necessary for the Sri Lanka tea industry to remain competitive in
the world market; as a corollary, it recommended that it would be necessary to
diversify some tea land to other crops, to prevent excessive supply and
depression of the world tea market.
2.02      GOSL determined that the region best suited for diversification
was the mid-country 2/ since (a) yields and quality of tea there were on
1/   Sessional Paper No. XVIII (1968).
2/   The 'mid-country' is variously defined as that part of the wet-zone
total area of 1.5 million ha having an average annual rainfall of 2,000-
3,700 mm and lying between elevations 300 and 1000 m or, for tea industry
statistical purposes, those tea estates lying between 600 and 1,200 m.



- 4 -
average lower than elsewhere and (b) since many estates were therefore
neglected soil erosion was accelerating and these lands would soon be vir-
tually useless unless remedial action was taken in this very densely populated
area.
2.03      In 1969/70 GOSL requested UNDP/FAO technical assistance to develop
a strategy to ensure optimal land use, based on technical and economic fea-
sibility studies of alternative crops. A UNDP project covering five years,
"Agricultural Diversification of Uneconomic Tea and Rubber Areas," was ini-
tiated during 1970 to study the problems and make recommendations. From 1973
this project focused on diversification out of tea on LRC held tea estates
and settlement of such land in three river catchments areas, Nilambe-
Attabage (NAC), Gurugoda-Ritigaha (GRC), and Mahaoya-Kudaoya (MKC).
2.04      Following this study and at the request of GOSL, the FAO/World Bank
Cooperative Program helped in preparation of a project for Bank group financ-
ing and, in May 1976, an IDA mission appraised the project. The project as
then formulated was unsuitable for IDA financing. The key problems were:
incomplete identification of land available for settlement; uncertain market
prospects for the crops to be diversified into, mainly spices; no cost re-
covery proposals; unsatisfactory organizational proposals; and the inclusicn
of social and physical infrastructure proposals (hospitals, schools, markets,
roads) that could not be justified economically.
2.05      As a result GOSL prepared a modified project which is the subject
of this appraisal report. The major objectives of this new project are to:
-    develop an institution which can implement a program
of rehabilitation, diversification, and settlement by
landless families of degraded lands, mainly nationalized
tea estates, and
-    halt the serious soil erosion that is ongoing under
uneconomic tea, by introducing more appropriate farming
and land use systems (perennial tree crops, pasture,
and forests) that will
-    increase national agricultural production and income.
2.06      The project is of a pilot or test nature that hopefully will be the
first in a series of diversification projects. It should generate data on the
practical aspects of modifying land use and settling former estate workers and
landless people. Additionally, the project would provide technical data on
farming systems and crop/livestock mixes under controlled conditions. While
it would not be possible to replicate the exact crop mix of this project in
other projects, the majority, of crops envisaged for use in later projects
would be introduced under the proposed project.



III. PROJECT AREA
Location
3.01      The project is in the densely populated mid-country near Kandy,
90 km northeast of Colombo (Map 13383). It encompasses parts of three catch-
ments, Nilambe-Atabage (NAC), Gurugoda-Ritigaha (GRC), and Mahaoya-Kudaoya
(MKC) in Kandy and Kegalle District. The total cultivable area is 42,000 ha
and project works would be carried out on 61 scattered tea estates totalling
about 11,500 ha of which 9,000 ha are cultivable.
Climate
3.02      Rainfall is high and fairly well distributied averaging 2,800 mm in
NAC to 4,000 mm in GRC. Temperatures depend on the altitude which ranges
from 500 to 2,000 m in the three catchments and are relatively constant, the
mean of the coldest month being rarely less than 20 IC. As rainfall is seldom
limiting and the soils fairly uniform, elevation and thus temperature largely
determines the crops and varieties of crops that can be grown.
Topography, Soils, and Soil Erosion
3.03      Topography.  The main features of the catchments are the steeply
dissected and mountainous terrain and the wide range in elevation from 500 m
to 2,000 m. Most slopes exceed 30%, many exceed 70%, and some are precipi-
tous with sheer rock outcrops. The valley bottoms are narrow, flat and
alluvial and used almost entirely to grow paddy.
3.04      Soils.  The soils are reddish brown or yellowish brown podsolic
soils, friable with varying degrees of stoniness. They vary in depth, but
are generally truncated through erosion. Under natural cover these soils
would have a pH of about 5.5 in the top soil, but are now acidic, often down
to pH 4.5 or less, due partly to the removal of top soil and partly to the
extensive use of sulphate of ammonia as a fertilizer on tea.
3.05      Soil Erosion.  Following many years of poor financial returns, and
consequent neglect, most of the tea has very high vacancy rates. This, coupled
with neglect of soil conservation, has tended to accelerate erosion with the
development of many gulleys and extensive layers of surface gravel due to the
removal of finer materials. The resultant peak flows and silt loads in the
rivers are serious.
The Population
3.06      General.  In the project area, the total population is approximately
230,000 and total cultivable area about 42,000 ha; t.hus 5.5 persons, the
average family, per cultivable ha. Most of the population is located in
villages (60%), the rest in Village Expansion Schemes (18%) and on estates
(22%). Average age of the population is low; in 1976, 50% were less than 20



years old. On the 61 project estates the population is about 16,000 people
but only half of them are Sri Lankan citizens; the remainder are Tamils whose
future citizen status is in doubt, pending completion of the Tamil repatria-
tion program.
3.07      Employmcnt and Incomes.  The estimated unemployment rate is about
30%. The total labor force increases by about 5,000 annually and few are able
to find permanent work. The official daily wage rate for unskilled workers in
agriculture in 1976 was Rs 7.5 (US$ 0.50) per male and Rs 6.5 (US$ 0.40) per
female worker; but, in practice, many receive less and get only casual work.
In consequence, many exist on less than Rs 2,400 (US$150) per family per year,
the absolute poverty line below which basic nutritional standards cannot be
maintained. A detailed socio-economic survey of the Gurugoda-Ritigaha catch-
ment in 1975 revealed that the average family income was only Rs 1,400. On
the 61 project estates about 7,000 people are employed as laborers, slightly
more than half being women tea pluckers.  The average family income of these
estate workers is estimated at Rs 3,000.
Social Infrastructure
3.08      The project area is well served by a network of over 150 km of
major roads, 300 km of minor roads, and a cheap and effective bus service to
even the smallest villages. Water supply comes mostly from perennial streams
and springs with a limited number of public wells. Hence, water borne diseases
are relatively common. Electricity is generally available. There are also
numerous retail shops, and regular markets in larger villages. There are over
40 junior and 20 secondary schools and some advanced training institutions
in Kandy and Kegalle. The area is adequately served by 9 rural hospitals,
16 central dispensaries and 42 estate dispensaries.
Agricultural Setting
3.09      The three catchments, like the whole mid-country, are characterized
by a dual agricultural economy. The plantation sector (tea, rubber, coconut)
is based on relatively large estates with the labor force, mostly Tamil origin,
living in so called labor lines, that are primitive barracks in very poor
conditions. The smallholder sector, in turn, is dominated by the Sinhalese
living in scattered small villages.
3.10      The smallholder sector is based predominantly on a mixed forest
garden system where a wide variety of perennial crops are grown:

Most smallholders also have access to some paddy in the valley bottoms. Mixed
forest gardens average 0.5 ha in the project area and are generally very poorly
managed with no regard to scientific agricultural husbandry practices.
3.11      The plantation sector has undergone major changes.  Many estates
have changed hands in the last 15 years with each successive owner anticipat-
ing nationalization. Consequently, estates were run to maximize short-term
returns which resulted in rapid deterioration, with virtually no expenditures
on maintenance or renewal. Under the Land Reform Act of 1972, the maximum
private land holding was set at 20 ha per adult faraily member with any excess
being acquired by the state. It is the acquisition of such excess land that
would be diversified and settled under the project. On the 61 estates,
average yields of made tea leaf are now about 510 kg/ha, declining by about
15% annually, compared to average yields of 1,100 kg/ha on better managed
public sector estates (SPC and JEDB).
Land Tenure, Size of Holdings and Present Land Use
3.12      Land ownership patterns as well as size distributions of village
lands and estate holdings vary considerably between the three catchments. On
average about 40% of the area is village lands and settlements and the rest
is mostly tea land owned by the Land Reform Commission and administered by
the Ministry of Plantations' State Plantations Corporation (SPC) and Janatha
Estates Development Board (JEDB). Individual private holdings in the village
areas are small, with more than 50% less than 0.5 ha. Though most Sri Lankan
estates are more than 400 ha, most of the 61 project estates acquired by the
Land Reform Commission (LRC) in 1972, range between 30 and 400 ha, mostly
below 100 ha.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      The four-year project, covering 11,500 ha, would diversify 4,600 ha
out of tea, 4,900 ha out of scrub land and 1,800 ha out of degraded forests



- 8 -
into more appropriate land use.  In areas where the land is suitable for
s->ttlement the project would develop two types of mixed tree farms, some tea
and some cardamom farms; where it is not, forest plantations and conservation
forest would be established. Albout 4,500 farms of 0.8 to 1.6 hectare would be
>marcated, planted with appropriate perennial crops and allocated to landless
families from the project catchments. Simple settler houses would be built in
clusters, for which water supplies and, where necessary, access roads would be
constructed. The project would be carried out by the National Agricultural
Diversification and Settlement Authority (NADSA), which has been set up by
GOSL to carry out this and similar projects. NADSA would implement all
project works using the prospective settlers as its labor force.
4.02      The project would comprise:
1.   Development of Mixed Tree Farms
(a)  2,550 Lower Altitude Mixed Tree Farms (LAMTF) below
750 m, on 2,800 ha;
(b) 1,300 Higher Altitude Mixed Tree Farms (HAMTF) with
pasture and dairying between 750-1,000 m, on 2,000 ha;
(c)  390 Cardamom Farms (CF) on 700 ha;
(d)  230 Tea Smallholder Farms on 180 ha.
2.   Social Infrastructure.  Construction of simple houses located
in clusters, access roads and village water supplies.
3.   Forestry.  Establishment of about 1,800 ha of pines, 1,900 ha
of eucalyptus and 2,100 ha of conservation forest.
4.03      The project would change the present land use as follows:
Table 4.1  Present and Projected Land Use
Present          Future
(ha)            (ha)
Tea                     4,800            2,800 LAMT Farms
Scrub Land              4,900            2,000 HAMT Farms
Degraded Forest         1,800              700 Cardamom Farms
180 Tea Smallholder Farms
3,700 Commercial Forest
2,100 Conservation Forest
All land presently under tea would be used for LAMT farms, HAMT farms and tea
smallholder farms. Scrub land would be converted into RAMT farms (230 ha) and
the balance into commercial and conservation forest. Degraded forest lands
would be used for establishing cardamom farms (700 ha) and for commercial forest.

B. Project Activities
Development of Mixed Tree Farms
4.04      Soil Conservation.  Of the project lands designated for farms,
2,300 ha are protected against soil erosion by existing soil conservation
structures. The remaining area would need bench terraces protecting 450 ha,
graded stone walls protecting 700 ha, lock and spill clrains protecting 950 ha,
and grass strips covering 125 ha. The extent of mechanical structures would
be kept to a minimum and agronomic soil conservation measures would be used
wherever feasible. In the areas designated for forest. and pasture, no con-
servation structures would be needed, but forest plantings would be on the
contour and in the pasture areas strips of selected high producing grasses
would be planted across the slopes.
4.05      For each farm a house and vegetable plot of 0.2 ha would be pro-
vided on land with less than 35% slope. For half of this area, bench terraces
protected with grass plantings would be constructed. Farms would mostly be on
land with slopes of over 35%. Where the slope is less than 35%, grass strips
would be planted on the contour. To establish these grass strips, tea bushes
would not be uprooted but cut and chemically killed to avoid soil disturbance.
Where the slope is over 35%, either graded stone walls would be constructed
where stone is available at the site, or lock and spill drains, where there
are no stones. To erect these mechanical structures tea bushes would be
uprooted from a strip 1 m wide along the structure lines.
4.06      For planning and supervising all technical aspects of the soil
conservation works, the project would provide additional staff (13 profes-
sionals plus support staff), vehicles (2 4-wheel drive and 10 motorcycles),
and equipment (field, cartographic and office equipment) to the Soil Conser-
vation Division (SCD) of the Department of Agriculture. The actual work would
be done under the supervision of NADSA staff by the prospective settlers, for
which the project would provide tools. For cost details see Annex 1, Table 2.
4.07      As soon as the soil conservation works were completed, the Survey
Department would demarcate 4,500 homesteads and farms for which 20 surveying
gangs (1 surveyor, 7 laborers) would be required. Beacons and maps would be
provided (see Annex 1, Table 3).
4.08      Soil Conditioning.  To increase the very low natural fertility of
the highly eroded soils, green manuring would be carried out on both the home-
steads and farms before and after planting. Green manure would be provided
through guatemala grass established with fertilizer on 10% of the area and
the subsequent cutting and compositing of the cut material. For costs see
Annex 1, Table 5, Page 1.
4.09      Planting Material.  To develop the 4,500 mixed tree farms, high
grade planting material (about 5 million seedlings, cuttings and splits of



- 10 -
over 20 species) would be required. This material would be produced mainly
by two existing project nurseries with expanded facilities: one at the Minor
Export Crop Research Institute at Matale and the other in the project area
on one of the former estates. Small field nurseries would be set up where
necessary. Coconut seedlings would be bought from the Coconut Research
Institute nursery. Ginger rhizomes would be selected within Sri Lanka or,
if necessary, imported from India and multiplied at the project nursery. The
amount of planting material, the species composition and the time needed are
shown in Table 4.2. Costs for planting material are shown in Annex 1, Table 5,
Page 2. A detailed plan for the production and purchase of planting material
has been prepared by NADSA and is on file.

4.10      Homestead Development.  Each participating family would be provided
with a small plot of 0.2 ha where a simple house would be constructed and
vegetables grown. On these plots, depending on subsistence requirements,
market prospects, temperature range and rainfall, a variety of vegetables such
as tomatoes, eggplants, beans, onions, cabbage, capsicum, sweet potatoes,
squash, garlic, lettuce, radishes, etc. would be grown. Whenever the terrain



- it -
allows, paddy would be grown. To provide shade and later fruit for the
family a few jak or breadfruit trees and some citrus trees would also be
planted.
4.11      Lower Altitude Mixed Tree Farms (LAMTF).  2,550 LAMTF, each about
0.8-1.0 ha, would be developed on land below 750 meters. In selecting the
species mix, the aim would be to reach an optimal plant composition from an
agricultural and economic point of view. Specifically, early maturing species
for initial farm income and to provide a balance of shade and light for the
various crops would be included, together with as many high value crops as
possible, and fast growing support trees for one of them, pepper.
4.12      To meet these criteria, the species selected are:  banana, to
provide shade for other seedlings and initial income; papaya and avocado for
early income, coconut, arecanut and breadfruit to provide shade and food;
gliricida as support tree for pepper; albizzia as a major tree for shade and
canopy adjustment; coffee, cloves, nutmeg, pepper, and ginger as cash crops.
4.13      Higher Altitude Mixed Tree Farms (HAMTF).  1,300 HAMTF, each about
1.2 ha, would be developed on land between 750 m and 1,000 m in elevation. The
species grown in HAMTF would be different. No papayas, coconuts, avocadoes and
nutmeg would be included, and banana would only be grown as a quickly develop-
ing shade tree. The proportion of coffee (robusta) would be much higher than
in the LAMTF. Cash crops would include pepper, coffee, cloves and ginger.
Also compared to the LAMTF, shade trees would be decreased and wind break
trees increased. Farm development costs (LAMTF and 'HAMTF) are in Annex 1,
Table 5.
4.14      All HAMT-farmers would have access to 0.3 ha of pasture which would
be planted under the project, and they would be provided with one house cow.
The pasture plot would be developed within 1 km of the homestead where the
cow would be kept and the cut and carry system of supplying fodder would be
adopted; of the pasture area of each farm, about 75% would be planted to grass
(Brachiaria brizantha and Panicum maximum) and about 25% to a legume crop
(Stylosanthes humilis). Alternate strips of Brachiaria and Panicum would be
planted across the hill slopes. Planting materials, seeds, and fertilizer
for establishing the pastures would be provided by the project. For costs
see Annex 1, Table 6, Page 2.
4.15      Since the farmers on HAMTF would need additional income until their
longer term tree crops came into bearing, about 1,650 dairy heifers (6-9 month
old) would be provided under the project by the beginning of year 3. The
Project Technical Unit (PTU) of the Ministry of Agriculture, which is handling
livestock procurement and technical services under the IDA financed dairy
project (504-CE) would be responsible for importing the animals if local
supplies are insufficient and for follow-up actions. Additional staff (1
livestock officer, 3 livestock extension officers, 1 veterinary surgeon, 2
field assistants, clerks, typists and drivers), vehicles (1 4-wheel drive, 6
motorcycles, 1 truck) and incremental operating expenditures would be provided
to the Project Technical Unit. (See Annex 1, Table 6).

4.16      Cardamom Farms.  390 cardamom farms, each about 1.6 ha, would be
developed on the limited areas suitable in the Gurugoda-Ritigaha Catchment.
Cardamom planting material wouLd be selected from high yielding malabar and
mysore varieties and interplanted with fast growing shade trees (glyricidia)
and higher canopy shade trees (albizzia). Costs are shown in Ani.n.x 1, Table 5
page 3.
4.17      Tea Smallholder Farms. 230 tea smallholdings, each about 0.8 ha,
would be formed on existing land where vegetatively propagated (VP) tea
yielding above 5,000 kg/ per ha of green leaf already exists (equivalent
to about 1,100 kg of made tea).
2.   Social Infrastructure
4.18      Housing.  About 4,500 simple semi-permanent houses would be built
at a cost of Rs 1,100 (US$69) each. These would provide adequate basic
shelter to the project participants for some years. It is expected that
settlers would themselves builcd more substantial structures as soon as their
farms generated sufficient revenue. They would have floor space of 6x6 m,
divided into living and sleeping space. In addition, a small verandah
(6x1.5 m) and an outdoor cooking place would be provided. All building
materials would be available locally and provided by NADSA--coconut leaves
(cadjans) and bamboo or arecanut trees for roof materials and poles, clay for
floor materials and timber for window frames and doors. Floors would be of
clay, mixed and beaten with earth. Until these houses are built by project
labor, the project participants would continue to live in their present homes.
They would normally walk to project sites or if necessary use the available
cheap and efficient public transportation system.
4.19      Water Supply.  The project would construct about (a) 540 village
wells, (b) 135 water distribution points through diversion of small streams
and construction of small tanks, and (c) 45 water distribution points through
construction of spring tanks. In some cases, natural springs would provide
the source for potable water. Tanks with 2.5 m high and 6 m long walls would
be constructed, based on rubble foundation and built with bricks, sand and
cement. To safeguard against waterborne diseases assurances were obtained
from GOSL that all wells would be protected by covers and that handpumps
for raising water would be installed. For all water tanks assurances were
obtained that GOSL would arrange for regular disinfection with common
bleaching powder.
4.20      Access Roads.  About 100 km of low-cost access roads to settlements
would be built at a unit cost of Rs 35,000 (US$2,200) per km. The roads would
be 4.5 m wide having approximately 6 culverts per km. Only levelling and
grading would be done, but no metalling. In addition, about 100 km of exist-
ing deteriorated estate roads would be maintained by NADSA, including
(a) clearing of culverts, (b) filling and patching of holes with metal and
sand, (c) minor strengthening of shoulders, (d) clearing of drains, and
(c) replacement of damaged road components (e.g., culverts). Unit cost of
maintenance per km is estimated at Rs 1,200 (US$75). For details on costs
of the social infrastructure component including the total amount of labor
requirements see Annex 1, Table 4.

3.   Forestry
4.21      Commercial Forests.  The project would plant about 1,900 ha to
fast growing Eucalyptus grandis and 1,800 ha to Pinus carribea. The choice
of these species is based on performance of existing forest stands in the
catchment. The forests would be established on land not suited to any other
form of land use and would be planted in relatively large contiguous blocks
to facilitate management. The eucalyptus forests would be grown on the
coppicing system and would be for fuelwood. The pine forests would be for
timber.
4.22      For planning and supervising all technical aspects of the reforesta-
tion, the project would provide additional staff (6 professionals plus support
staff), vehicles (2 4-wheel drive, 3 tractors with trailers) plus funds for
site preparation for nurseries, seed material, and incremental operating ex-
penditures to the Forestry Department (FD). The actual work would be done by
the prospective settlers under the supervision of staff of FD and NADSA. For
cost details see Annex 1, Table 7.
4.23      Conservation Forests.  In the project area, land with slopes over
75% (2,100 ha), now under jungle and patna (a fire climax plant community
largely consisting of grasses), would be preserved as conservation areas to
prevent erosion and to reduce the rate of rain run-off. These lands would be
protected against agricultural use by locals and against fire in the driest
months, particularly January to March by employing settlers as fire watchers.
The forests would be owned and managed by the Forest Department.
C.   Implementation Schedule
4.24      The project as designed consists of two phases, a development phase
(3 years) and a consolidation phase (3 years). IDA's direct involvement would
only extend over the development phase plus the first year of the consolida-
tion phase. All developmental works would start between July 1978 and January
1979 and are scheduled for completion within 3 years by June 1981 as shown on
the Implementation Schedule (Figure 4.1). The consolidation phase would extend
over another 3 years until June 1984. The development phase would be charac-
terized by complete responsibility of NADSA and its staff for getting the
homesteads and farms established and would end with the allotment of farms to
settlers.   The consolidation phase would be characterized by a gradual with-
drawal of NADSA staff from the area and would end by the time (year 6) the
tree crops would have come into bearing. The sequence of project activities
would be:
-    increased production of planting material from existing
nurseries starting early 1978;
-    Soil conservation work starting in the projiect area
in July 1978 and ending in April 1979, except for the
establishment of grass strips on farms which would
continue in April-June 1979 and the green manuring on
farms which would be a continuous process;

Surveying of homesteads and farms in January-March 1979;
Construction of access roads, houses and provision of water
supply starting by the end of 1978 as soon as progress on the
soil conservation works allows and ending by end of March
1979;
Planting of vegetable plots, mixed tree farms and cardamom
farms starting with the first rainy season in 1979;
Forestry planting spread over 3 to 4 rainy seasons starting
by October-December 1979;
Importation of dairy heifers by late 1979 to be kept at a
calf rearing station until 15 months later; and planting of
pasture in the first half of 1981.

D. Cost Estimates and Financing
'.25      Details of project costs are in Annex 1 and summarized in Table 4.3.
Total project cost is estimated at US$6.5 M, of which US$2.0 M or 31% is for-
eign exchange. Taxes and duties amount to US$0.1 M. Cost estimates are
expressed in projected mid-1978 prices by inflating appraisal estimates (end
1977) by 5% for local costs and 3.75% for foreign costs. Works estimates are
based on detailed quantity estimates provided by the Soil Conservation Divi-
sion, the Forestry Department, tea estates and local contractors, familiar
with the works required. Unit prices for equipment and materials are based
on December 1977 quotations. ]Physical contingencies of 15% have been applied
to all labor requirements and 10% to material, equipment and operating expend-
itures; no physical contingencies were included for salaries. Estimated price
increases over the implementation period amount to about 13% of base cost plus
physical contingencies and assume the following annual rates of price infla-
tion for local and foreign costs:
Inflation Rate (Percent)

Financing
4.26      The proposed IDA Credit of US$4.5 million would finance the full
foreign exchange costs and about 55% of local costs, or about 70% of the total
project cost, net of taxes and duties. GOSL would contribute the remaining
US$2.0 M. GOSL would allocate 100% of project funds on a grant basis to NADSA
in the form of annual budgetary allocations. The NADSA budget would include
funds to cover project related expenditures of the Soil Conservation Division,
the Forestry Department, and the PTU of the National Livestock Board (see
Annex 1, Table 2, 6 and 7). GOSL and NADSA would submit to IDA, not later
than November 1st each year, a detailed implementation and financial plan for
the following fiscal year which coincides with the calendar year. Details of
the contents of these reports would be agreed with IDA prior to the submission
of the first report.

4.27      Proposed project financing is summarized below (in thousand US
dollars):
GOSL     IDA       Total
NADSA                            744       700      1,444
Farm Development                 519    2,000       2,519
Social Infrastructure            219       500        719
Forestry                         106       500        606

Total                        2,000    4,500      6,500
E. Procurement and Disbursement
4.28      Equipment and Vehicles.  NADSA would be responsible for all procure-
ment activities. Since it would be extremely difficult to ensure adequate
maintenance and spares for a small number of a variety of imported vehicles
(US$0.23 M) and tractors and trailers (US$0.40 M) not already available in
Sri Lanka, procurement would be through competitive bidding advertised locally
and in accordance with local procedures which are acceptable to IDA. There
are enough local firms and representatives of foreign firms to ensure a suf-
ficient degree of competition and reasonable prices. Small tools, and survey
and office equipment (US$0.18 M) would be procured by prudent shopping follow-
ing local procedures which are acceptable to IDA.
4.29      In order to expedite early project implementation, GOSL has been
asked to prepare tender documents for vehicles, tractors and trailers for
which retroactive financing of up to US$0.5 M is recommended.
4.30      Cattle.  Approximately 1,650 six to nine months old dairy heifers
costing about US$0.7 million net of contingencies would be imported. The
import of these heifers would be organized by the PTU. Because of the wide
variations in breeds, types and adaptability of animals available, and the
disease situation in supplying countries, priced proposals would be obtained
from at least three countries free from foot and mouth disease, that can
supply heifers of the type required, in accordance with procedures acceptable
to IDA. Before accepting any offer, these animals would be inspected in the
country of delivery by a duly authorized representative of the PTU who would
also check that transportation arrangements were acceptable to ensure healthy
arrival.
4.31      Assurances were obtained from GOSL that, for all tenders for vehicles,
and dairy cattle worth over US$100,000, technical specifications and draft
tender documents would be submitted to IDA before bidding documents were
issued; and for individual contracts for goods worth over US$100,000, bid
evaluation would be submitted to IDA for approval before making the awards.

4.32      Civil Works and Land Development.  The bulk of project works, in-
cluding construction of access roads, housing, water supply, soil conserva-
tion, planting of homesteads, farms and forest, would be executed directly by
NADSA using the prospective settlers as the labor force. Any skilled labor
requirements would be met by contracting local craftsmen.
4.33      Planting Material.  The Forestry Department would buy pines seed
(US$0.03 M) directly from suppliers. Supplies are limited and only two
supplier countries are known. Ginger rhizomes would be procured directly
by negotiated purchases after quotations have been solicited from at least
two suppliers.
4.34      Disbursements.  Disbursements would be made against:  (i) 100% of
the foreign expenditures for directly imported goods; (ii) 60% of expenditures
for goods procured locally; (iii) 100% of the ex-factory price of goods manu-
facturer locally; (iv) 50% of project related expenditures for salaries of
staff and operating costs of NADSA, Soil Conservation Division, Forestry
Department, and PTU; 1/ (v) 60% of expenditures for all project works carried
out by settler-labor and skilled labor; (vi) 100% of expenditures for consult-
ants. Disbursements for salaries of staff and operating expenditures would be
made against certified statements of expenditures. Disbursements for project
works under force account would be made every quarter against physical works
progress report and a certificate of expenditure from NADSA. The documenta-
tion for this would be retained by NADSA and made available for inspection
during project supervision. Estimated schedules of expenditures, disburse-
ments and the proposed allocation of the proceeds of ithe loan are presented
in Annex 1, Tables 8, 9 and 10.
F. Accounts and Audit
4.35      Separate project accounts would be kept by NADSA for all project
expenditures incurred by NADSA, the Soil Conservation Division, the Forestry
Department and the PTU.
4.36      Throughout the project, NADSA would maintain summary accounts and a
record of disbursement applications forwarded to IDA. Project accounts would
be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. Certified
copies of the audited accounts and the auditor's reports would be submitted
to IDA within six months of the end of each calendar year. The audit report
would be required to include, inter alia, a statement that funds disbursed
against statements of expenditure had been used for the purpose for which they
were provided.
1/   Staff and operating costs for NADSA, SCD, FD and PTU are shown in
Annex 1, Table 1, page 2 and 3; Table 2, page 1; Table 6, page 1
and Table 7.

G. Environmental Effects
4.37      The thrust of the whole project is to stop the physical degradation
of the environment in the projlect area and to ensure that project lands can
be used for agricultural purposes in the future. Soil conservation measures
would be carried out accompanied by a shift in land use from uneconomic tea
to perennial tree crops, pasture and forest which provide good ground cover.
These project activities, besides enabling continued agricultural use, would
reduce the silt load in some of the tributaries of the Mahaweli Ganga River
and the silting up of irrigation tanks fed by that river.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Project Organization
The National Agricultural Diversification and Settlement Authority (NADSA)
5.01      General.  GOSL established NADSA early in 1978 under the State
Agricultural Corporations Act of 1972 to implement this and similar projects
on a larger scale in the future. It is an agency under the Ministry of Agri-
culture and Lands (MAL) and will be financed by regular GOSL budget appro-
priations. A seven-member Board of Directors will have overall responsibility
for project implementation. All seven Board members have been appointed by
the Minister of Agriculture and Lands. The Board would meet at least quarterly
to review the status of project implementation. Full delegation of authority
for day to day operations would be made to the General Manager (GM) who would
be the Authority's Chief Executive.
5.02      Organization.  The GM would be directly assisted by a small tech-
nical unit and there would be two departments: operations and support services.
The operations department would have four sub-units, three area operations
divisions and one nursery unit. The support services department would com-
prise units for accounting, auditing, and personnel and office administration
(Figure 5.1).
5.03      Staffing.  At headquarters, the GM would be assisted by a Deputy
General Manager and a Chief Technical Advisor, a Progress Control Officer and
a Board Secretary, all directly reporting to him. Also at headquarters, the
operations department would be headed by a Chief of Operations, responsible
for planning and programming all field work. He would either be a member of
the planters community, having worked as estate superintendent for at least
ten years, or an outstanding agricultural degree holder with at least ten
years experience in successfully managing a large labor force. The Chief of
Operations office staff would include two engineering assistants responsible
for the infrastructure component of the project (houses, roads and water
supply), one transportation and equipment officer and one nursery officer.

The support services departrnent at headquarters would be headed by a Chief
of Support Services and would comprise officers for accounting, internal
auditing, personnel and office administration.
5.04      At field level three Area Operations Officers (AOO) would be in
charge of 25 Field Operations Officers (FOO) and the Nursery Unit would be
under a nursery officer. The three AOO would either be former estate super-
intendents with five years of experience or agricultural university graduates
with five years of pertinent experience. The Nursery Officer would have at
least 5 years of experience in running as a manager a government or private
nursery and the Field Operations Officers would either be former estate
assistant superintendents with ten years of service or diploma holders in
agriculture with seven years of service. In all cases, familiarity with
organizing a large labor force would be the decisive selection criteria.
5.05      The 25 FOO, one per 180 settlers, would form the backbone of NADSA.
They would be in daily contact with the settlers and would live in the field.
The FOO would be responsible for organizing the settler labor force for all
project activities, including those requiring technical expertise from a
specialized government agency (Soil Conservation Division, Forestry Department,
PTU, Survey Department). Each would be assisted by one clerk who would keep
records of the number of working days provided by each settler family, to
provide the basis for payment and the decision on settler entitlement to a
plot after three years. For details on staffing see Annex l, Table 1, Page 2.
5.06      Training of the FOO.  FOO, before joining the project, would undergo
refresher courses in three subjects: a one month training in soil conserva-
tion provided by staff of the Soil Conservation Division, a two weeks train-
ing in agronomy of spice crops provided by staff of the Research Station of
the Minor Export Crops Department and a two weeks course in extension methods
provided by the In-service Training Institute of the Department of Agriculture.
Courses would be held in the existing facilities of these agencies and field
trips would be organized. After these initial courses during project
implementation, FOO would meet fortnightly with their AOO to program the
activities for the next fortnight and to review experiences from the pre-
vious fortnight. The Senior Technical Advisor from the GM's office would
attend these meetings and Subject Matter Specialist (SMS) from the spe-
cialized agencies involved in project execution would be called in as and
when required.
5.07      Equipment.  All NA)SA professional staff would be mobile; the AOO
would have 4-wheel drives and the FOO motorcycles. The nursery unit would
have 2 tractors, 4 trailers and 5 trucks. The trucks would be available at
Headquarters for transport of planting materials and fertilizer. One tractor
with two-way radio communication equipment and 2 trailers per FOO would be
available in the field. These tractors and trailers would be used in soil
conservation works for the transport of stones over short distances, in all
planting activities for transporting planting materials and fertilizer, and
in implementing the social infrastructure component for transporting building
materials from roads to the settlements. Minor farming equipment and work
tools such as hoes, rakes, shovels, baskets, etc., would be provided to all
project participants. For cost details see Annex 1, Table 1, Page 1.



- 21 -
5.08      Other Agencies Involved.  Coordination between NADSA and the spe-
cialized government and semi-government agencies referred to in paras 4.06,
4.14 and 4.22, would be ensured because the heads of these agencies report
directly to the Minister of Agriculture and Lands. Detailed annual working
plans would be prepared by these agencies and approved by NADSA. For day-to-
day operations, field staff of these agencies during their involvement in
project implementation would be responsible to NADSA. While this staff would
be working out of the offices of their parent agencies or live in the field,
their parent agency would only be responsible for the technical backstopping
and the quality and soundness of their work. But all decisions as to when and
where soil conservation or forestry works would be carried out for example,
would be taken by NADSA. Assurances have been received from GOSL that all
staff provided under this project to SCD, FD and PTU would work exclusively
on the project.
B. Project Implementation
5.09      A legal opinion by the Attorney General confirming that project
lands acquired under the Land Reform Act are owned by the government and are
free of incumbrances has been received. Although th;e transfer of control of
land covered by the Project Area to NADSA would be a condition of effective-
ness, management of those lands will be transfered to NADSA according to a
time phase transition plan under development by Government. Until such man-
agement is turned over to NADSA under this plan, those agencies currently
managing the lands will continue to perform that function.
Settler - Selection
5.10      General.  It is desirable that the labor force on the 61 tea estates
to be handed over from SPC and JEDB to NADSA should be carefully prepared for
the event and informed about potential effects of the project on their future.
To this end the Government is preparing an estate by estate census of the
citizen status of the labor force involved to determine the size of the Tamil
population and to identify those scheduled for repatriation or application for
citizenship. Assurances have been received that GOSL would take all measures
possible to provide, either through relocation to other estates, or through
accelerated repatriation to India, relief to those workers not eligible for
settlement under the project.
5.11      Selection Criteria and Procedures.  Selection would be a two stage
process and it would be NADSA's responsibility to see that it be carried out.
At the beginning of the project, about 4,500 families would be selected as
participants in the project to constitute the work force of NADSA and as
prospective permanent settlers. Selection would be from the following
categories in order of priority:
I    -    displaced families of citizens or of those to be granted
citizenship prior to June 30, 1981 from the 61 project
estates;



- 22 -
II  -  landless families from villages in the project
catchments; and
III  -  unemployed youth from the project catchments.
Settlers would be selected from a lower priority category only if there were
no eligible families remaining in the preceding category. Farming experience
would not be a factor except in the allocation of plots with a dairy component,
these would be given whenever possible to settlers with some dairying expe-
rience. This initial selection would qualify a settler to receive a plot at
the end of the third year subject to satisfactory performance while employed
by NADSA in project works during this initial development phase. The main
criterion would be accepting, and satisfactorily completing, at least 80% of
the jobs offered by the Authority. Any vacancies among the settlers would be
filled from the highest priority category containing eligible settlers.
Assurances have been received that GOSL would follow this settler selection
procedure.
Plucking of Tea
5.12      As project works progress the area under tea would decline, but
meanwhile, NADSA through the FOO would organize the plucking on the residual
areas, which would be done by settler family members, mostly wives. NADSA
would pay the going wage and sell the green leaf tea on its own account.
Over the three year period in which plucking would continue, NADSA would at
least break even (see Annex 2, Table 8). Transport and processing of green
leaf would be carried out by tea estates remaining in the area, managed by
JEDB and State Plantations Corporation. Assurances have been received that
arrangements satisfactory to IDA would be made between GOSL and NADSA to
guarantee the transport and lprocessing of green leaf from the project area.
5.13      The area of vegetaltively propagated (VP) tea having high enough
yields to remain under tea (180 ha) would be assigned by NADSA to settler
families in plots of 0.8 ha. The first three years tea plucking would be
organized as a training cum selection period. Wages would be paid out of
income. In year 4, these settlers, about 200, would enter into marketing
arrangements for transport of their green leaf with the nearest estate.
Land Allocation
5.14      At the end of the first year settlers selected would be allocated,
on a temporary lease basis, a homestead consisting of 0.2 hectares of land
on which a house would have been constructed. Homesteads together with
farms would be allocated on a permanent basis under the Sale of State Lands
(Special Provisions) Law, No. 43 of 1973. Thereunder the settler would
elect to: (i) purchase his holding and receive a "grant" (a title) to the
land; or (ii) pay the price of the holding in twenty annual installments.
Until the last installment is paid he would hold a "permit" for the land
which would be replaced by a "grant" when payment was complete. The amount
of the installments would be determined in accordance with para 8.07. In-
stallment payments would begiLn on the following basis: (a) tea smallholdings



- 23 -
in the fourth project year; (b) high altitude mixed tree farms in the sixth
project year; (c) cardamom farms in the seventh project year; and (d) low
altitude mixed tree farms in the eighth project year. Assurances have been
received that GOSL would follow this land allocation procedure.
Sale of Dairy Animals
5.15      As most project farmers would not be skilled cattle keepers,
imported yourg heifers after about 15 months at the Haragama calf rearing
unit would be sold as pregnant heifers, five month in calf, to successful
dairy farmers under the present IDA-financed dairy project and not to project
participants. These farmers would trade one of their local animals for one
imported and finance the price difference between the two out of their own
resources or through existing credit sources. Funds thus generated would be
used by NADSA to pay part of the cost of keeping the imported animals at
Haragama. Cows exchanged would be inspected by PTU staff to ensure that they
would be suitable for sale to project farmers, and this exchange scheme would
be under the responsibility of the PTU.
5.16      Local animals obtained under this cow exchange system would be sold
to project farmers on credit under procedures already developed under the
ongoing dairy project. Both the Bank of Ceylon and the Peoples Bank have
expressed interest in participating. Banking facilities are available in
the area. Farmers would apply for credit through one of the PTU farm plan-
ning technicians in the project area who would help the applicant to prepare
a farm development plan for submission to the lending institution. Where
PTU considers project farmers have sufficient livestock experience, imported
heifers from Haragama may be sold to them directly.
5.17      Presently the IDA financed Sri Lanka Dairy Development Project is
being reformulated along the lines of the successful AMUL-model developed in
India. Farmer owned Dairy Cooperative Societies (DCS) and Milk Unions would
be established under by-laws similar to those developed in the three IDA-
assisted Indian dairy projects. A Registrar of Cooperatives in the Ministry
of Agriculture and Lands (MAL) would be responsible for registering DCS. The
PTU would be responsible for organizing the service functions and establishing
DCS. The four existing processing plants of the National Milk Board are in
the process of becoming Milk Unions and equity would be transferred gradually
to member DCS who would be represented on the Board of the Union. All inputs
and services would ultimately be controlled from the Union processing plant
and distributed through the DCS to member producers. Assurances have been
received that GOSL would establish DCS in the project area with by-laws satis-
factory to IDA not later than July 31, 1981 before dairy animals kept at
Haragama would be sold to farmers.
Consulting Services
5.18      To assist in carrying out the project and especially in variety
selection and the processing and marketing of the most important spices to be
grown under the project, especially ginger, pepper and cardamom, NADSA would
employ experts for short-term visits to assist its own senior technical staff.



- 24 -
The estimated consultant input is 12 man-months at a total cost of US$96,000
including international transportation. Assurances have been received that
NADSA would employ consultants with qualifications and on terms and conditions
acceptable to IDA.
Project Monitoring
5.19      The Progress ControL Officer and his staff and the Chief Technical
Advisor would be responsible for project monitoring. They would keep records
on utilization of projects inputs, especially the use of tractors, vehicles,
trucks, planting material, staff and the settler work force. They would also
collect data on timely generation of project outputs in relation to the imple-
mentation schedule such as construction of soil conservation structures, houses,
roads, and water supply and establishment of farms and on unit costs thereof
and on circumstances that are critical to the effective implementation of the
project (cooperation at field level between staff of NADSA, SCD, FD and PTU).
5.20      The monitoring unit would also be responsible for ongoing evaluation.
They would conduct sample surveys to determine the overall family income of the
settlers, including: (a) pay from NADSA, (b) pay from employment outside the
project and (c) income from the house vegetable plot and farms (built-up of
yields and farmgate prices for inputs and outputs would be closely monitored).
Assurances have been received that NADSA would collect these data twice a year
and that, if family incomes were below Rs 3,600 in constant 1978 Rupees, GOSL
would promptly take necessary measures, acceptable to IDA, to ensure that
settlers have the financial ability to continue to develop their farms. To
provide an independent assessment in greater depth of the economic and social
impact of the project, provision has been made for the monitoring unit to
commission such surveys and studies as might be necessary. All information
generated by the monitoring unit would be reviewed in time to form the basis
for the project design of other diversification projects that are planned.
C. Agricultural Support Services
5.21      All agricultural production support including planting material,
fertilizer, and extension and research would be provided initially cost free
to the laborer/settlers by NADSA during the development phase (3 years).
These input costs along with accrued interest would be capitalized and par-
tially recovered in the sales prices of the land (paras 8.07 and 8.08).
Thereafter NADSA staff would be gradually reduced from a ratio of 1 FOO to
180 settlers to 1 FOO to 450 settlers. This remaining staff would continue
until the end of year 4 to provide fertilizer to the settlers. To ensure
that proper husbandry practices are followed in year 5 and 6 when farmers'
incomes are still low, assurances have been received that NADSA would continue
to organize and remunerate selected settlers (see Table 8.4) for training of
pepper vines and necessary weeding, fertilizing and pruning for all crops on
settlement farms in the project area. From year 7 onwards NADSA's respon-
sibility for the settlers would stop and they would depend on existing
agricultural service institutions in the area. By that time settlers would
have become experienced farmers.

D. Preparation of Future Projects
5.22      Land rehabilitation, diversification and settlement of degrad-i
lands is needed on a broad scale. The project would be only an initial
effort, preparing the way for a larger and more comprehensive program.
In March 1978, GOSL issued a statement on its diversification policy which
outlines its general objectives for diversification and establishes respon-
sibilities and authority for diversification efforts; between concerned
ministries and institutions (Annex 5). The Minister- of Agriculture and
Lands has also assigned to the Agricultural Diversification Division the
task to inventory lands suitable for diversification and to prepare a second
project not later than mid-1980.
VI. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
6.01      All crops included in the mixed tree farms and cardamom have been
grown in Sri Lanka for a long time. A great deal of research and extension
information is available on their planting, growing, harvesting and pro-
cessing. Only ginger would be a relatively new crop to the project area.
It appears that at least two local varieties of ginger are grown in Sri
Lanka, of which only one produces good dry ginger acceptable to the inter-
national market. Analysis of the available cultivars for their dry ginger
characteristics would be carried out before being used as planting material
in the project.
6.02      In the type of mixed tree farming proposed for the project three
factors basically determine the value of total output: yields per individual
plant, plant density, and species composition.
6.03      The following assumptions have been made:
Yields (for the major crops at full development)   Fertilizer Application
pepper    -   3.6 kg dry per vine                   LAMTF  -  250 kg/farm/year
ginger    -   12.0 tons green per ha                HAMTF  -  900 kg/farm/year
cardamom  -   600 kg green per ha                   CF      -  250 kg/farm/year
cloves    -   2.73 kg dry per tree
coffee    -   0.45 kg dry per plant

6.04      The cropping pattern proposed has a plant density which is consid-
ered to be optimum at the present levels of soil fertility. It has a high
proportion of high value crops such as pepper and cloves. Additionally,
ginger has been introduced. With improved planting material, cultural
practices and the use of fertilizer, a 10% higher yield then in existing
farms was assumed.  Soil fertility on project lands will gradually improve,
and plant population densities can be increased accordingly. On the basis
of only 10% higher yields, the gross returns per ha on the project farms
would be about Rs 12,000, or more than double gross returns on traditional
farms, primarily because of the difference in species composition.
6.05      Production Output (see Table 6.1).  About 70% of value of total
production excluding forestry in 1990 would be from export crops, the rest
from crops destined for the local market. Among the export crops, pepper at
1,300 tons and 31% of total value of project output is the single most im-
portant crop. Next in importance is ginger with 600 tons and 12% of total
value, cardamom with 400 tons and 11% of total value and, cloves with 106
tons and 8% of total value. The share of coffee in total value is 5% and other
crops, mainly nutmeg, coconut, and arecanut account for 6% of the total value.
Produce for the local market would include vegetables (8% of total value),
milk (6% of total value) and other crops including bananas, papayas, avocados,
and citrus fruits (13% of total value). Forestry products would include on
an annual basis 35,000 cu meter of eucalyptus after Year 8 and 13,000 cu meter
of pine after Year 22.
6.06      Production Inputs.  The main annual inputs to sustain this level of
production would be labor and fertilizer. Total annual labor requirements for
all the farms are estimated at 5,500 man-years, easily obtainable from the
4,500 settler households, and at 500 man-years for forest activities, exclud-
ing felling and processing. Annual project fertilizer consumption is esti-
mated at 2,000 tons.

every year. Pinus would be harvested over six years in 22-year cycles.
VII. PRICES, MARKET PROSPECTS AND MA1RKETING
7.01      More than 70% of the marketable surplus of crops from the project
area would be for export. Of these, pepper would be the most important. Sri
Lanka has a long tradition of producing and exporting its pepper which is well
known internationally for high (and favorable) oleoresin content; in spite of
which Sri Lanka has had only a small share (0.5%) of the international trade
of around 90,000 tons per year. Pepper exports have declined (now less than
25% of the 400 ton 1957-76 average) because internal consumption has increased



- 28 -
since Government stopped import of chillies, for which pepper is a substitute.
Project production would allow Sri Lanka to reverse this declining trend. By
1990 the expected project area production of about 1,300 tons would be only
about 5% of the expected increase in international pepper trade. Sri Lanka
would be able to export this quantity without major difficulties or adverse
effect on the world market prices.
7.02      The project would produce an exportable surplus of other spices such
as ginger, cardamom and cloves and a small quantity of coffee. The market
outlook for these commodities is good, and as the project surplus would form
less than 6% of international trade in any of the spices and the coffee pro-
duction would be less than 1% of international trade, no major marketing prob-
lem is expected. Prices of these commodities are currently high and lower
long-term average prices have been projected. The ratio of projected farmgate
prices to the current farmgate prices varies between 55 and 80 percent (see
Annex 4). Traditional marketing channels exist in the project area and are
efficient in all cases excepting cardamom. Assurance have been received from
GOSL that cardamom growers would be registered and that it would ensure that
government-owned cardamom estates in the project area would provide a process-
ing and marketing channel for the cardamom producers.
7.03      Project milk surplus would amount to about 1,500 tons per year,
which would displace about 170 tons of milk powder imports annually. In the
catchment areas milk collection is currently carried out by multi-purpose
cooperative societies in an inefficient manner.  Assurances have been received
from GOSL that dairy cooperatives along the lines being suggested under Credit-
504 would be formed in the catchment areas (see para 5.17). Milk collected by
cooperatives would be sold to the National Milk Board (NMB), which could
process the milk at the nearest milk processing plant at Pallekelle. This
plant is currently operating at 30% capacity and NMB intends to rehabilitate
it to bring it up to capacity.
7.04      Non-industrial demand for fuelwood in the catchment areas is esti-
mated at 85,000 cu m annually. Eucalyptus from project lands would be very
competitive with the existing sources of fuelwood, which are of poor quality
and dwindling in supply. No marketing problem is anticipated. Fuelwood price
has increased by more than 100% in the last eighteen months and a further
30% increase, in real terms, is anticipated by 1985. The Project would also
produce pine for lumber. Market prospects are excellent. GOSL recently had
to ban cutting of trees in state forests as a reaction to overcutting of
forests. This has severely constrained supply and project output should be
able to relieve this problem. Price of pine for lumber is conservatively
projected at about $40 per cu in, which is the current price for inferior
quality lumber. Further details of pricing and market prospects and marketing
are given in Annex 4.

VIII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Farm Budgets
8.01      Detailed budgets for the various settlement components and sub-
components are in Annex 2 and summarized in Table 8.1. These budgets reveal
one of the problems associated with smallholder tree crop cultivation. Many
of the crops, though highly profitable, mature slowly. Hence, revenue buildup
is slow. This places a heavy financial burdens on settlers in the initial
years. Recognizing this financial problem, the project would try to overcome
it in three ways. First, revenues would be provided in initial years by in-
cluding some fast growing crops such as vegetables ancd ginger. Second, inputs
would be provided by NADSA directly and recovered as part of farmers rent pay-
ments. Third, NADSA would employ prospective farmers as paid laborers during
6 years (see para 5.21). This would guarantee employment opportunities for
2.4 persons per family in year 1, 1.7 persons in year 2, 1.01 persons in
year 3, and 3 month per settler in year 4-6. For cardamom farmers about 6
months annually of paid work opportunities would have to be provided during
years 4-6 to provide them with an adequate subsistence income. This approach
would also ensure that (a) inputs are used directly for developing farms, (b)
farms are not neglected because of frustration of farmers over slow develop-
ment, and (c) farmers are trained in proper agricultural practices.
8.02      The time period for which NADSA would have to contribute financially
to the development of farms would vary according to plant composition of the
different types of farms (Table 8.2).

8.03      The Summary Farm Budgets (Table 8.1) show no cash expense figures
in the initial years. This reflects full financing of investment by NADSA.
For HAMT farms, in year 4, only partial financing from NADSA would be required.
In later years, current revenues would be able to cover cash expenses and leave
sufficient surplus to cover basic needs of the settler's family. Cash expenses
for most of the farms are very low because tree crops usually require very
small cash inputs (a little fertilizer). No outside labor would have to be
hired because of small farm size, extended harvesting period and absence of
any significant annual replanting. Family labor requirements are presented in
Table 20 of Annex 3 and are summarized below for year 12. A socio-economic
survey of the catchment area shows available labor participation of 2.2 persons
per family. Considering 285 available days per year, labor availability would
be 627 mandays per farm. Even considering some seasonality in harvesting, the
family labor would suffice. In view of the low cash expenses for all farms
(excepting HAMT farms), high and well distributed revenues, very little working
capital would be required. For HAMT farms, expenses appear high because of
debt service on dairy loans. Dairy cooperatives would deduct the necessary
amount from each day's milk sales. Therefore no cash reserve for debt service
will have to be maintained. Working capital required would vary between 2-4
percent of revenue and would be internally financed.

Farmers' Income
8.04      After the crucial consolidation phase, most farmers' net revenue
would rise rapidly to average annual levels between Rs 6,000 and Rs 12,000
ensuring sufficient surplus to allow farmers to pay back most of the project
costs. See Table 8.4.

Project Rent
8.05      To evaluate settlers' capacity to repay project costs, project rent
for the four farm models has been estimated and presented in Annex 2, Table
12. The "rent" accruing to a settler family indicates the maximum amount the
family can pay and still benefit from the project. All the above indices
have been computed in real terms and in present value terms. The discount
rate used is 10%, representing the estimated economic opportunity cost of
capital. From the present value of the net farm revenue, opportunity costs
of family labor, allowance for risk and imputed value of management services
are deducted. On a per farm basis the project rent is estimated at Rs 19,500.
This implies that an average settler could be expected to pay at most Rs 2,300
per year for 20 years.
Project Cost Recovery
8.06      Total project costs are valued at the end of the developmental phase
(in year 4) at market prices using a 10% interest rate! and are estimated at
about Rs 86 M. The value excludes the opportunity cost of uprooting tea,
because that is done as a part of national objective of tea diversification
and farmers in the project area should not be made to pay for the cost of that
policy. It also excludes the costs for the forestry component. On a per farm
basis the cost works out to be Rs 19,000. 1/  This is below the total project
rent and therefore full rent recovery would result in full project cost re-
covery. Considering that the project area farmers' income would be close to
the critical consumption level of about Rs 3,600 for the first several years
and would not rise above the national average family income of Rs 12,000 at
full development, full rent recovery is not advisable and a 66% project rent
recovery index would be aimed at. The HAMT farms would be paying an additional
fixed charge of Rs 660 per year for five years to repay full cost of heifer
purchase along with accrued interest at 10%.
8.07      The Sale of State Lands Law provides for cost recovery in equal
installments over normally 20 years. Annual installments based on a 10%
discount rate together with the corresponding sales prices and first years
of repayments are shown in Table 8.5.
1/   At Rs 19,000 (US$1,190) the cost per family are in the lower range of
World Bank supported settlement projects. See Annex 2, Table 11.

Since these figures are estimated in constant 1978 rupees, before contract
signing, these values would have to be appropriately modified to reflect
then current values. In the absence of inflation, the annual installment
payments together with government revenues from forest lands would represent
a cost recovery index of about 80 percent. If there is a 7 percent annual
inflation the cost recovery index in real terms would decline to about 55
percent. During negotiations cost recovery methods have been discussed and
an assurance has been received that GOSL would adopt a cost recovery scheme
satisfactory to IDA.
Fiscal Impact
8.08      The GOSL contribution to the project would be Rs 104 M in direct
project costs and Rs 27 M in lost revenues and taxes from uprooted tea in the
project area. The project cost would amount to about Rs 30,000 (US$1,815) per
family or Rs 5,000 (US$315) per capita. The costs would be spread over six
years and would average about Rs 22 M per year, which is 0.5 percent of GOSL's
capital budget. As the proceeds from the sale of State lands would recover
Rs 58 M, the net cost of the project would be Rs 73 M, or Rs 2,700 (US$170)
per capita only.
8.09      Incremental operations and maintenance cost of the project would be
Rs 0.7 M per year and would be more than offset by direct revenues amounting
to Rs 6.0 M per year from Government-owned commercial forests to be created
by the project. The project would also create incremental employment for
1,200 families and thereby move them out of Government's welfare program.
Assuming that rice subsidies continue at the present rate, the project
would save Rs 1.3 M per year in subsidies. Thus the net long-term impact
of the project on the Budget would be positive and would amount to about
to about Rs 6.6 M per year, excluding payments for capital cost recovery.
IX. BENEFITS, ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
Benefits
Production Benefits
9.01      The main benefits wculd be from export crops such as pepper,
ginger, cardamom, cloves, and nutmeg (para 6.05). The farmgate value of the



- 34 -
incremental production of these export crops would be Rs 40 M (US$2.5 M) per
year by 1990. Other crops, milk and forestry products (excluding pines) 1/
worth Rs 14 M (US$0.9 M) per year for the local market would also be produced.
Additional income opportunities amounting to Rs 14 M (US$0.9) per year would
be created for processing and marketing of the farm produce.
Employment Effects
9.02      Owing to declining employment opportunities on tea estates and in-
creasing population, the catchment areas suffer from severe unemployment. 2/
Without project, another 4,800 ha of tea land would be abandoned by 1985,
putting another 3,300 households (9% of catchment area population) out of
work. The project, by giving direct employment to about 4,500 households,
would reverse this trend and reduce migration to the already overcrowded
cities. This employment would be generated at a cost of only about Rs 12,000
per person. This compares with Rs 44,000 of fixed capital per person employed
for public sector enterprises in 1973.
income Distribution
9.03      All the direct beneficiaries of the project would be landless farm
families or unemployed youth. Average per capita income in these groups is
presently less than US$60 per annum. The project would help to more than
double their per capita income to about US$125 per annum by 1990. The land-
less farm workers would receive individual title to about 5,700 ha of land
from the state sector. This is consistent with the policy of GOSL to make
the population less dependent on the state sector.
Foreign Exchange Impact
9.04      Sri Lanka would earn Rs 48 M (US$3 M) per year in foreign exchange
from export of spices and coffee and would save Rs 7 M (US$0.5 M) per year
by 1990 in import of milk products and fuel oil. The annual cost of importing
fertilizer would be about Rs 9 M (US$0.6 M), giving a net foreign exchange
benefit of Rs 46 M (US$2.9 M) per year by 1990.
Other Benefits
9.05      The benefits from the social infrastructure component are largely
non-quantifiable, but would respond to the basic needs of the settlers by
providing improved shelter, safe and adequate water supply and better access
to the area's basic road network and nearby services. Upgrading of water
supply would have a beneficial impact on the health standards of the popu-
lation by reducing water-borne diseases. The planned community development
1/   Pines would not be harvested until year 2000.
2/   A Government survey of the catchment areas, conducted in 1976, esti-
mated unemployment at 30% of the workforce.



- 35 -
by concentrating housing into clusters and improving accessibility of serv-
ices would also constitute a major step in government's policy to increase
viability and attractiveness of settlement schemes.
9.06      GOSL's strategy in the tea sector is to increase productivity of
tea lands in better tea areas through replanting. To prevent any increase
in production which might create marketing problems, GOSL's strategy also
involves diversifying out of tea in the least desirable tea areas. The
proposed project, by creating a diversification implementation capability,
would assist GOSL to implement its strategy in the tea sector.
9.07      Partly due to the lower profitability of tea in the mid-country, the
level of investment on tea estates in the project area was low. This contri-
buted to high rates of soil erosion, resulting in heavy silt load in some of
the tributaries of the Mahaweli Ganga River and silting up of irrigation tanks
fed by that river. Every year landslides occur on tea estates resulting in
property damage. The project would shift land use to pasture, forestry and
those tree crops which provide good perpetual canopy. This would gradually
reduce soil erosion and help re!habilitate the soil in the project area.
Economic Analysis
9.08      The economic rate of return (ERR) of the project would be about
16% and is based on cost and benefit streams shown in Table 9.1.

fit from tea. See Annex 3, Table 11-14 for calculations of conversion
factors (CF). CF is the ratio of the world market (border) price to the
domestic market price, where the domestic price is expressed in dollars
converted at the market exchange rate.
lb   56% of the costs are for unskilled labor (CF=0.67).
/c   43% of the costs are for unskilled labor (CF=0.67), 42% for fertilizer
(CF=3.24-3.7) and 9% for dairy cattle feed (CF=1.31-1.69).
/d   Income from tea foregone due to project.  Income foregone is low in the
beginning because of phased uprooting of tea. See Annex 3, Table 1, 5,
6, 18 and 19.



- 3 7 -
9.09      In calculating the economic rate of return, foreign exchange is
valued at the current exchange rate of US$1 = Rs 16 to which the Sri Lankan
rupee was devalued in November 1977. 1/ Output prices used in the analysis
have been discussed in Chapter 7 and Annex 3. For the most part economic
prices of project output are very close to their financial prices. On the
cost side, fertilizer has been valued at its projected c.i.f. price plus
internal processing and distribution cost. Owing to heavy subsidization, this
cost is almost three times the present financial cost to farmers and is
expected to increase to almost four times that value by 1985. Opportunity
cost of unskilled labor has been valued at two-thirds of the Government
established minimum wage rate, because of the high unemployment rate in and
around the project area (para 9.02). Opportunity cost of feeding dairy cattle
has been estimated based partly on the f.o.b. value of exporting coconut meal.
By 1985 the economic cost is expected to be almost 70% higher than the finan-
cial cost. Some project land is currently under tea. Economic benefits
foregone due to uprooting of tea are deducted from project benefits. The
deductions are lower in the first two years of the project because tea would
be uprooted slowly and in a phased manner. After year six of the project no
benefits are deducted because even without project, tea would have been
abandoned because of lower yields, lower tea prices and higher unit costs of
production.
9.10      Economic analysis of project components and subcomponents is pre-
sented in Annex 3, and summarized below.
1/   With high import duties (up, to 100%+) the equilibrium rate is probably
nearer 18 than 16 in the long-term. Had a shadow exchange rate of 18
been used, the ERR would be slightly higher.

/a Excluding the Dairy Farm subcomponent, which is analyzed separately.
9.12      The table shows that ERR of project components and subcomponents
range between 12% for the dairy subcomponent and 20% for the cardamom farms
component, with the majority of components clustered between 14% and 18%.
Though the rate of return of the dairy subcomponent is relatively low, it is
still justifiable since the opportunity cost of capital is estimated at about
10%. Dairy pastures would occupy some of the poorest lands in the project
area; more than 33% of which would be suitable for no other productive use.
Though the cardamom farms have a high rate of return, the component cannot be
increased in size as cardamom requires high elevation, good shade and heavy
rainfall and no additional areas are available in the three catchments.
Sensitivity Analysis and Project Risks
9.13      The project has been designed to minimize risks, both to the economy
and the farmer, through diversified production. None of the commodities would
contribute more than 30% to project's economic benefilt nor more than 35% to
any settler's income. This reduces risks inherent in commodity price fluc-
tuations. In addition, risks of decline in yield due to plant diseases and
pest attack are also reduced. This aspect of the proposed project is revealed
by a sensitivity analysis of prices, yields and cost of production of the
different commodities.

9.14      Though most of the economic risks associated with changes in indi-
vidual commodity price levels and yields have been reduced through diversified
project design, the risk due to delay in realization of project benefit
remains. 1/ If there is a one--year delay in realization of project benefits
due to slower than anticipated rate of soil rehabilitation, the ERR would be
14%. This level of ERR is still reasonable and therefore the risk is accep-
table.
9.15      The project also attempts to reduce social risks.  All of the set-
tlers would come either from estates or villages in the project area. There-
fore, the potentially disruptive psychological and social impact of resettle-
ment would be minimized. However, a different type of social risk exists.
The project, by hastening the removal of marginal tea would also hasten the
unemployment of tea estate workers. Though the project would provide land to
a larger number of families than those losing estate employment (para 9.02),
1/   If project implementation is delayed, so that both costs and benefits
are delayed, the ERR would not change. However, the ERR would suffer
if only benefits are delayed due to, for instance, slower than antici-
pated pace of soil rehabilitations even though project execution may
have been correct and timely.

not all tea estate workers would be eligible to become settlers since under
Sri Lankan law, only citizens would be eligible and a substantial proportion
of estate workers include those whose citizenship status is as yet undetermined.
Since they also happen to belong to the cohesive Tamil minority, there is a
risk of social friction. Assurances have been receivetd that GOSL would make
arrangements satisfactory to IDA for those workers not. eligible for settle-
ment under the project (see para 5.10).
X. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
10.01     During negotiations the following major assurances were obtained:
(a)  To safeguard against waterborne diseases assurances
were obtained from GOSL that all wells would be pro-
tected by covers and that handpumps for raising water
would be installed. For all water tanks assurances were
obtained that GOSL would arrange for regular disinfection
with common bleaching powder (4.19);
(b)  All staff provided under this project to SCD, FD and PTU
would work exclusively on the project (5.08);
(c)  GOSL would take all measures possible to provide, either
through relocation to other estates, or through acceler-
ated repatriation, relief to those workers not eligible
for settlement under the project (5.10);
(d)  GOSL would use a two-stage settler selection procedure
acceptable to IDA (5.11);
(e)  Arrangements would be made between GOSL and. NADSA to
guarantee the transport and processing of g;reen leaf
from the project area (5.12);
(f)  GOSL would adopt land allocation procedures satisfac-
tory to IDA (5.14);
(g)  GOSL would establish DCS with by-laws satisfactory to
IDA not later than July 31, 1981, before dairy animals
would be sold to farmers (5.17);
(h)  NADSA would employ consultants with qualifications and
on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA (5.18);
(i)  NADSA would collect income data of settlers at least
twice a year and that if family incomes were below
Rs 3,600 in constant 1978 Rupees, GOSL would promptly
take necessary measures, acceptable to IDA., to ensure
that settlers have the financial ability to continue
to develop their farms (5.20);

(j) In project year 5 and 6 NADSA would continue to organize
and remunerate settlers for training of pepper vines and
necessary weeding, fertilizing and pruning for all crops
or settlement farms in the project area (5.21);
(k) GOSL would start a registration scheme for cardamom growers
in the project area and that GOSL would ensure that
Government-owned cardamom estates in the project area
would provide a processing and marketing channel for the
cardamom producers (7.02);
(1) GOSL would adopt cost recovery proposals satisfactory
to IDA (8.07).
10.02     During negotiations it was agreed that transfer of exclusive con-
trol of land covered by the project area to NADSA would be a condition of
credit effectiveness (5.09).
10.03     With the indicated assurances, the project is suitable for an IDA
Credit of US$4.5 M to the Government of Sri Lanka.

Assumptions and Explanations
1/ Soil conservation works set out in this table are for homestead vegetable plots and Higher and Lower
Altitude Mixed Farms. Maintenance cost of lock and spill drains is shown in table on costs of farm establishment.
2/ Bench terracing of house vegetable plots (each 0.2 ha). Because housing clusters are generally on
gentler slopes assume only 1/2 of area requires benching. 350 man-days/ha.
3/ Graded stone walls(GSW) and lock and spill drains (LSD). Assume these structures only required on half
the area of the 2 types of farms, other half area with gentler slopes ( < 35%) being treated with
biological soil conservation techniques. Assume that 25% of area to receive structures has existing
usable structures built for tea-growing. Assume that 1/2 area to receive strictures has locally available
stone for construction of GSW otherwise build CSD. For GSW - 300 man-days per ha for unskilled labor at
Rs 9/day and 53 man/days-ha at Rsl5/day for skilled labor. For LSD - 116 man/days/ha at Rs 9/day.
4/ To accompany both GSW and LSD. Assume 50% of area has existing usable drains. 53 man-days per ha.
5/  Contour-planted strips of Guatemala grass grown on 1/2 area of the 2 types of farms.  Strips
occupy 1/15th of area = 125 ha. Allow 25 man-days/ha.
6/ Cut and kill at 15 man-days/ha.
7/  Uproot tea at 75 man-days/ha.  Allows for 25% of area with existing structures from which no tea removed.                  X 7
8/  First uproot tea on 448 ha at 75 man/days per ha.                                                                           m X

1/ 14odel A--elevation below 750m. Average size of holding (houseplot plus farm) taken as 1.0-1.2,ha to
preserve the area flexibility necessary to compensate for poor quality land.
21 Model B--elevation 750 - l,OOOm.
3/ The original land use classification contained a dairy component. This area was later
utilized for proposed Model A farms.  In view of this former classification it was assumed
that some of the dairy farm areas were at high elevation; they have therefore been reclassi-
fied as areas for Model B.
4/ 1 hectare of mixed farm predominantly coffee and pepper and 0.3 hectare of pasture.
$/ There are about 415 ha of VP tea in Na and MK catchments.  Taking 10 ha as the minimum area
per estate worth consideration as a working unit for division into settlements, the VP tea
area would be about 230 ha.                                         
6/ Farm and homestead areas vary according to quality and availability of land suitable for                                                            ' M

/ About 1,730 carda   plants/ha.  Yields will start in 3rd year after planting, therefore in 5th year of project
about 45 kg/ha or half of the farm area can be harvested. Price assumed is Es 15 per kg of green uncured
cardamom. The yields will increase rapidly until year 12 when yields will start declining until replanting
in year 25.
U Fertilizer applied at two different compositions for young and mature cardamom NPK (Nas urea) 40:25:31 and
45:55:50 respectively (183 and 289 kg/ha at Re 585 per ton, applied as two applications). Year 2 half of
the area fertilized.

1/ It is assumed that two members from each farm family could work for about 267 days in each year
at Rs 9 per day for an annual family income of Rs 4,800.
2/ Uncertainty about yield is least for tea farms consisting of existing high yielding clonal tea.  Farmgate
prices are also more stable than those for spices. Hence, risk and uncertainty (RU) allowance of 12%
is allowed. Cardamom farms would suffer from both yield uncertainty and very severe price fluctuation;
hence, RU allowance of 25% is allowed. Mixed farms are able to diversify risk, hence intermediate RU
of 15% and 20% are estimated.
3/ Value of management services is estimated at 10% of Income (1-2-3) for mixed farms and 5% for other farms.
4 HAMT farms would have an additional fixed charge burden of Rs 660 for full payment of heifer purchase.
Hence, a lower rent recovery index is aimed at.
5/ Excluding income and costs of forestry component. If the forestry component is also included, cost
recovery would be about 80%.

4/ Corresponds to without project case.
About 600 ha out of 1,923 ha would be eroded tea land with 1977 yield of 500 kg/ha.  Tea will continue to be
plucked for first two years and therefore no opportunity cost is shown in those years.  Because of declining
yields and tea prices, tea plucking will have negative net economic benefits after year 4.  The other land                    F M
is currently under patna grass.

1/  Benefit from 1,789 ha.  Cropping done over six years in blocks of approximately 300 ha.
First cropping done 21 to 26 years after planting. Value increase for delayed cropping
would be 10% per annum (about 6% due to volume increase and 4% due to better quality).
2/  Includes cost of vehicles, tractors and seed.  Duties and taxes amounting to Rs 50,000 excluded.
3/  Includes diesel fuel for vehicles (CF = 1.2), Fertilizer (CF = 3.77) and settler labor (CF = 0.67).
4/  Corresponds to without project differential net benefit.  About 1,000 ha out of 1789 ha would be eroded tea
land with 1977 yield of 500 kg/ha.  Tea will continue to be plucked for first two years and therefore no                 X
opportunity cost is shown in those years.  Because of declining yields and tea prices, tea plucking will
have negative net economic benefits after year 4.  The other land is currently under patna grass.
5/  Residual Value of vehicles (50% depreciation in three years).

1/ Sawn timber for furniture sells at Rs 900/cu.meter and by-products at about
Rs 50.00/cu meter (free market prices). Economic price is taken to be the same as
financial price, because any imported pine (even without duties
and taxes) would be too costly and therefore would not be easy
to sell. The impact of selling pine would be to reduce illegal
deforestation4 the benefit from which, though difficult to estimate,
would be at least as high as the financial price of that timber.
2/ Profit margins are not considered excessive; therefore, the financial
cost also represents economic cost.
3/ Economic cost is lower because of shadow pricing of labor at 2/3rds
of its financial value.

sold in Colombo auctions. The price discount for this quality
differential is about 25%. The relative proportions are 1:9; giving a

PRICES, MARKET PROSPECTS AND MARKETING
Export Crops - Prices and Market Prospects
1.        The international market price for pepper is about $1.80 per kg.
This is unusually high and a lower long-term average of US$1.29 per kg is
expected. The corresponding Colombo auction market price would be Rs 16.5
(US$1.03) per kg. Allowing for marketing costs, a farmgate price of Rs 13.2
per kg is expected. A comparison of the current and projected farmgate
price of pepper and other major spices is in Table 1.

- current financial                    20.0       15.0     95.0          80.0
/a   Prices are per kg of cured cardamom.  Current financial price is lower
than current economic price because of export duty. Cardamom prices
are expected to fall and the export duty to be removed to maintain
producer incentives.
2.        The second major project export crop would be dry ginger.  Tradition-
ally, Sri Lanka was an importer, but in recent years has emerged as an exporter
with about 3% of the 10,000 ton international trade. Ginger is a very labor
intensive crop. Therefore, some of the relatively higher labor cost, ginger
exporting countries such as Jamaica, have reduced their exports. Sri Lanka,
with lower labor costs, should be able to increase its future market share.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
The estimated production increase of about 600 tons would be about 6% of the
expected international trade. No major marketing problem is expected. The
farmgate price of dry ginger is expected to be Rs 11 per kg which is 44% of
the expected London c.i.f. price of Rs 25 (UK 89p) per kg. This compares
with current farmgate prices of Rs 15/kg and 1976 price of Rs 11/kg.
3.        Cardamom would be third in importance amongst project export crops.
Sri Lanka is one of the four leading exporters, along with India, Guatemala,
and Tanzania, but still with less than 10% of the international trade. The
Middle East is the main market for cardamom. Sri Lanka's official export is
about 180 tons per year, but declining. Most Sri Lankan cardamom is over
thirty years old and beyond peak yielding. The expected project increase in
production of about 80 tons (cured) by 1990 would reverse this trend. This
would be about 4% of the international trade and no marketing problem is ex-
pected. Cardamom prices have shown a steep rise since 1973, because of in-
creased demand in the Middle East. Colombo auction prices have reflected
this trend and increased from Rs 35/kg in 1972 to a high of Rs 200/kg in 1977.
This price is not sustainable in the long run and a long-term average Colombo
price of Rs 100/kg is projected. Allowing for local marketing and processing
charges of about Rs 25/kg, the estimated farmgate price would be Rs 75/kg
(cured) or Rs 15/kg (green).
4.        Current market prospects for Sri Lankan cloves are good, but long-
term prospects are uncertain. Tanzania and Malagasy Republic are by far the
leading exporters and Sri Lanka's share, flowing through official channels
is only about 5% (375 tons per year). Indonesia accounts for more than 50%
of the world's import of cloves but has recently been encouraging greater
production internally. There is considerable uncertainty in trade circles
about the extent to which this will reduce Indonesian Lmports. In view of
this uncertainty, the clove component of the proposed project has been
kept small and would contribute less than 10% to the settler's income by 199G.
The uncertain market prospects are also reflected in the farmgate price pro-
jection of about Rs 44 per kg compared with a current price of Rs 80 per kg.
5.        Sri Lanka has recently emerged as a minor coffee exporter and ex-
ports have steadily increased from about 130 tons in 1973 to 1,710 in 1976,
still less than 1% of the international trade. Internal demand has also
been strong and export was banned for part of 1976. In view of this strong
internal demand and increasing export demand, the project area production of
287 tons should be easily marketable. The farmgate price projections for
coffee are shown in Table 2.

6.         Robusta variety, the type grown in Sri Lanka, sells at 60% below
the international market price whereby 15% is a quality discount and 45% is
a discount for low volume and distance to main markets in Europe and North
America.
7.        Other export crops, such as coconut, arecanut, nutmeg and mace,
are still traditional exports but the marketable surplus of each would be less
than 3% of the settler's income.  No market problems are expected.  Since the
impact of income from these crops on the financial and economic analysis of the
project and settlers' benefits is small, the projected farmgate price has been
assumed to be the same as the current farmgate price (in constant rupees).
Export Crops - Marketing
8.         Traditionally, coffee and all spices have been processed and stored
on the farm. Processing is simple and involves sun drying; coffee is pounded
to remove pulp; mace is usually separated from the nutmeg nut; then all these
crops are winnowed, cleaned, graded and packed.  This works quite well for all
spices except cardamom and ginger. Sun drying of cardamon tends to bleach the
color. Since the market price is very sensitive to color, the more modern
method involves drying in barns where humidity and temperature are controlled.
There are many estates near the project area, owned by Janawasama, a public
sector corporation. They own more modern drying facilities but are reluctant
to buy green cardamom from farmers because opening up a market channel near
the estates would encourage stealing estate cardamom for sale to the estates.
The estates would be willing to buy and process cardamom for a fee, if the
growers of cardamom were registered.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
9.        Spices and coffee are high value, low volume crops which after
processing can be kept for a few months on farms without difficulty. The
general practice is to store on farm and sell when cash is needed. No
storage problem for export crops is foreseen.
10.       Coffee and spices share a common marketing channel which is quite
well developed in Kandy and Kegalle Districts. Travelling collectors buy
spices and coffee on farm and charge high margins ranging from 15-33% of
sales value because of the effort involved, low volumes, and market risks.
Collectors sell to wholesalers at district centers. The farmer, if he wishes,
can sell directly to the large wholesalers, but has rarely done so because of
lack of market information, and the greater convenience and availability of
credit from collectors and village traders. Recently Colombo auction prices
have begun to be broadcast on radio, which has brought greater price conscious-
ness and partial disintermediation. Most farmers having more than 0.4 ha of
spices now sell directly to wholesalers. Wholesalers sell to exporters mostly
through private auction in Colombo. Government controls export through the
Floor Price Scheme, which involves setting of minimum export price for all
spices, essential oils and coffee every week, after consultation with the main
traders. It also provides for registration of contracts and enforcement of
standards and contracts. The aim is to prevent under-invoicing, and to build
a good reputation for reliability of Sri Lankan exports. Alternative channels
are Markfed (a cooperative apex organization) and Government-owned Consul
Exports. These have not been very successful in competing with the private
trade. Most project area farmers would sell directly to wholesalers in Kandy.
Between Colombo (f.o.b.) and farmgate, the marketing cost of this channel
would be about 25% of farmgate prices.
Crops for Local Market
11.       Each farmer would produce vegetables on his home garden and fruits on
his farm (excepting cardamom and tea farmers). Produced year round, and
except for some seasonal peak production, most would be consumed on the farm.
About half the fruits are also likely to be consumed on the farm. The remain-
ing 25% of vegetables, amounting to about 900 tons (Rs 1.2 million) and 50%
of fruits valued at Rs 3.5 million, would be sold at the Kandy produce market.
At present, 15,000 tons per year are sold through this market and there is a
strong demand for vegetables and fruits. Private dealers from northern Sri
Lanka sell fish in Kandy District and often take back vegetables to defray part
of their transport costs. This adds to the demand for fresh produce in Kandy.
No marketing problem is expected from the anticipated project surplus of about
two thousand tons per year.
12.       Government's Marketing Department is quite active in procuring
produce in the catchment areas and sends trucks to village centers during peak
harvesting season to collect fruits and vegetables for overnight transfer to
Colombo. The produce is retailed in Colombo and excess fruits are processed
at a Government-owned plant in Colombo. Since the surplus would be small and
in most cases retailed and consumed within a week after harvesting, no storage
problems are foreseen.



ANNEX 4

Forestry Products
13.       The increase in fuel oil price, coupled with the increase in popu-
lation, has increased fuelwood demand significantly. Most tea estates which
had switched from wood to oil are now switching back or would like to do so.
At the same time, firewood supply in Kandy District is declining. Owing to
the population pressure, the forests are being depleted. Increasing demand
and declining supplies are reflected in price pressures which have increased
wholesale price by more than 100% in the last eighteen months, from Rs 23 to
Rs 50/cu. m. Future non-industrial demand for firewood in the catchments is
conservatively estimated at about 85,000 cu meters. This implies that the
project area production would have to capture about 40% of the market share
(assuming that as tea vanishes from the catchments, industrial demand would
become very small). The only other major competitive source of fuelwood would
be old rubber trees cut for replanting. These would produce about 50,000 cu
meters of fuelvood per year. The Eucalyptus wood as fuel is better than
rubber. Therefore, the project area production should be very competitive and
as long as only one sixth of the project eucalyptus area is harvested in any
one year, no marketing problem would arise. The financial price of fuelwood
is projected at about Rs 65 per cu meter based on the subsidized cost of an
equivalent amount of fuel oil. Similarly the economic price is projected at
Rs 78 per cu meter, considering the unsubsidized price of fuel oil.
14.       The project area would also produce pine for lumber.  With increasing
population, the demand for lumber is also increasing. In previous years there
had been an overcutting of forests and as a reaction the present Government has
banned further cutting of trees in state forests. This has made the supply
situation quite difficult. A substantial portion of lumber supply is coming
from illicit cutting. Also, poor quality wood, such as from Media Composita,
is being used for lumber and is selling at Rs 616 per cu meter. Considering
that pine is not very good quality lumber and that the effect of the increase
in population might be counterbalanced by some relaxation in Government's ban,
the long-term financial price is also estimated at Rs 616 per cu. meter. The
economic price would be the same as the financial price because transporta-
tion cost of this low value lumber makes it a non-tradable good. The quan-
tity marketed would be 18,700 cubic meters compared to a present day demand
of around 160,000 cubic meters in entire Sri Lanka. The project area is near
many densely populated areas. Attaining a market share of about 12% should
not be difficult.
15.       Forestry products from State lands are marketed through the State
Timber Corporation (STC). The STC licenses private sawmill owners to cut
trees in specified areas. These entrepreneurs arrange for elephants and
laborers to pull down trees and contract with private trucking companies to
move felled trees to their mills. The procedure for firewood extraction is
similar excepting that sometimes STC itself cuts the trees and stacks the wood
by the nearest roadside, from where wholesalers and large users purchase the
firewood. The retail trade in both cases is not controlled by Government and
therefore market prices are close to the economic value. For fuelwood there
is slight distortion caused by subsidizing of alternative fuel (fuel oil).



ANNEX 4
Page 6
Since fuel oil is freely available, the subsidy of 17% on fuel oil acts to
keep the fuelvood price also below its true economic value by about 17%.
Dairy Products
16.       The market prospects for dairy products in Sri Lanka is excellent.
The demand for milk far exceeds local production. Sri Lanka has had to import
on the average about 7,000 tons of whole milk powder and about 1,500 tons of
other milk products every year. The project area would produce about 2,100 tons
of milk of which 70%, or about 1,500 tons, would be marketable surplus. This
would reduce imports marginally by about 170 tons of milk powder annually.
17.       Milk is processed by the Government-owned NatiLonal Milk Board (NMB).
NMB, however, does not accept milk directly from small producers with less
than 35 liters of milk to sell. In the catchment areas, multipurpose coopera-
tive societies have been given sole authority to collect milk and supply to
NMB.  Milk collection by MPCS is inefficient and results in low producer
prices and incentives.
18.       The milk collected by cooperatives is purchased by NMB at its milk
collection and chilling centers. There are two such collection centers, at
Galaha and Gampola, within a couple of miles from the project area. With the
planned expansion of Galaha center's capacity by about 5,000 liters per day,
the project area surplus of about 4,000 liters per day can be accommodated.
19.       The chilled milk from the collection centers would be moved to the
milk processing plant at Pallekelle in Kandy District - a distance of about
20 miles. The plant, built with Danish assistance, has a processing capacity
of about 20,000 liters per day. At present the plant is operating at less
than 30% of capacity because some of its machinery has corroded. NMB intends
to order replacements and to bring the plant up to capacity.
20.       NMB pays for the milk according to a sliding scale based on fat
content of milk. The current rates are as follows:
Table 6.3: National Milk Board Procurement Price
Fat Content               Milk Price
(Rs per liter)
2%                       0.80
4%                       1.60
4.5%                     1.80
The project cows would produce milk with 4.5% fat content. Milk transporta-
tion cost would be about Rs 0.10 per liter, allowing the settlers to receive
Rs 1.70 per liter for their milk production. In real terms, this price is not
expected to change. The economic price of milk, based on reconstituted milk
production from imported ingredients, would be Rs 1.77 per liter -- a figure
not very different from the financial price.

SRI LANKA
TREE CROP DIVERSIFICATION PROJECT (TEA) I
POLICY ON AGRICULTURAL DIVERSIFICATION
GOVERNMENT OF SRI LANKA
1.   Background
1.1       Sri Lanka's agriculture and her export economy continues to rest
too narrowly on the restricted base of tea, rubber and coconut. In recent
years several steps were taken towards agricultural diversification. This
included the introduction of a crop diversification subsidy scheme, estab-
lishment of the Minor Export Crops Department and Minor Export Crops
Research Stations, the wide-ranging investigations carried out by the UNDP/
FAO assisted Agricultural Div,ersification Project.
1.2       It is the policy of the present government to continue and inten-
sify these efforts towards national economic and agricultural diversifica-
tion and to consolidate gains which have been made so far and to undertake
further new programmes towards this end. However, this will be done without
losing sight of the fact that our major crops of tea, rubber and coconut
will remain important for a long time to come. Diversification will com-
plement and not compete with the rehabilitation efforts.
2.   Large-scale National Agricultural Diversification
2.1       The desirability of broadening our national agricultural production
and export base will be apparent from the statistical data in this regard.
In brief, the weakness of our present situation is that we are dangerously
dependent on only a few commodlities, and any price decline in these, rela-
tive to the prices of essential imports, poses a clear threat to our future
economic growth. Such dependence puts us in an unacceptably high-risk
situation. We must reduce this risk by broadening the base of our major
exports, particularly agricultural exports. The UNDP/FAO Diversification
Project of 1970-1975 had this as its objective, and the main thrust of our
diversification efforts has so far been towards this macro-economic objec-
tive. From 1970, it was the policy of the then government to aim at a
reduction of tea areas of approximately 200,000 acres and a lesser reduction
of rubber area, in the belief that concentration on a smaller area of high
yielding varieties would not reduce total production but would, on the other
hand, release large areas for the production of other diversified crops.
2.2       The UNDP/FAO Project made slower than expected progress in estab-
lishing the economic and financial feasibility of crop substitution. Some
crops, e.g. mulberry, were tried with little success. Nevertheless, the



ANNEX 5
Page 2
outcome of this early diversification project has been a request to IBRD-IDA
to finance a settlement-rehabilitation programme on 26,000 acres of such ex-
tea lands, to settle 4,500 families on 2-3 acre farms. This will be a pilot
project leading to a larger more comprehensive diversification programme.
2.3       In the period during which tree crop diversification was being
investigated circumstances in the tree crop sector changed. Production was
virtually static and diversification on the scale envisaged a decade earlier
is no longer feasible. In view of this, and in order to still achieve ade-
quate economic diversification Government now proposes to add a new dimension
to its diversification policy.
3.   New Policy
3.1       Government is conscious of the fact that those lands subject to
heavy soil erosion and whose yields have declined rapidly, have to be reha-
bilated as a measure to conserve the nations land resources. Where such
lands are available in fairly large extents and within a contiguous area,
NADSA will execute the rehabilitation-cum-diversification projects. The
estate management agencies of M/PI will execute diversification/rehabilitation
on smaller extents of lands within individual estates. Preliminary estimates
indicate that there are about 100,000 acres of such estate lands requiring
rehabilitation and diversification into pasture, forestry, commercial and
food crops.
3.2       At the same time, the Government will aim at broader economic
diversification by expanding the cultivation of "minor export crops" and
horticultural crops by development and settlement of new lands. It is
estimated that there are about a 250,000 acres of presently uncultivated
but cultivable jungle lands and under-utilized coconut lands.
3.3       Most components of the pilot project, such as soil conservation,
land preparation, planting, provision of infrastructure would be common to
both types of diversification and settlement projects. The Government will
examine the comparative economic and social advantages of specific projects
under both types of diversification approaches, and dlecide on the most
desirable for eventual implementation.  The selected diversification projects
would not only generate productive employment which will in turn increase our
GNP, but will also draw the educated unemployed youths to the lands. It is
the intention of government to settle these lands creating a land owning
peasantry assured of a reasonable income.
4.   Institutional Arrangements
4.1       The primary responsibility of identifying and formulating develop-
ment - diversification projects is entrusted to the Agricultural Planning
Division of the Agriculture Ministry. This has been set up by amalgamating
the earlier Agricultural Project Preparation Unit (APPU) and the Agricultural
Diversification Division. To enhance the skills of this Division, UNDP/FAO
Technical Assistance for 3 years beginning June 1978 has also been obtained.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
Agricultural Projects Review Committee has been set up at the Agriculture
Ministry for the purpose of scrutinising project proposals and for recom-
mending projects for financing and implementation.
4.2       National Agricultural Diversification and Settlement Authority,
an independent corporation, has been established to undertake the imple-
mentation of large-scale diversification projects. Another statutory
corporation, named Agricultural Development Authority has been set up
and allotted the main function of intensifying cultivation of the coconut
lands, by underplanting and intercropping.
4.3       To support the Pilot Tree Crops Diversification Project and to
service current and proposed diversification projects, the well situated
Pallekelle Estate (3,200 acres) has already been transferred to NADSA to
run (a) a National Nursery-cum-Plant Improvement Centre for diversified
crops and horticultural crops; and (b) Demonstration-cum-Training Centre
in agricultural diversification. To expedite the planting materials pro-
duction programme, NADSA is exploring the possibility of establishing a
tissue culture laboratory.
4.4       The Survey Department is presently conducting a survey to identify
and map cultivable state lands and a Technical Committee drawn from M/A & L
and M/PI is making field investigations to prepare an estate lands inventory.
The Research Divisions of Minor Export Crops Department and Agriculture
Department are carrying out the necessary research and expanding the exten-
sion services to support the proposed Diversification Programme.
5.   Conclusion
5.1       In the coming years the Government will give priority to the pro-
duction of diversified crops and horticultural crops. To carry out all these
projects within a reasonable time will be beyond the financial capacities
of the Government. Therefore external technical and financial assistance
will be sought from international agencies and bilateral sources.
5.2       In Sri Lanka's rich agricultural history, Taprobane by which she
was known to the world was famous for spices. The lure of our fragrant
spices attracted the foreign invaders to our shores. It is in the fitness
of things that Sri Lanka should go back to her traditional crops, assisted
generously by the World Bank and other aid giving agencies.
