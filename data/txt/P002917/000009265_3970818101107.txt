SECOND POWER PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:             The Republic of Uganda.
Beneficiary:          Uganda Electricity Board (UEB).
Amount:               SDR 29.5 million (US$28.8 million equivalent).
Terms:                Standard.
Onlending Terms:      20 years, including 5 years of grace, at 10% annual
interest; the foreign exchange risk to be borne by
UEB.
Project Description:  The project consists of four main parts:
(i)    At the Owen Falls Power Station, ten turbo-
generator units would be rehabilitated, and
structural repairs would be implemented to the
daam and to the power house. Furthermore,
electrical and mechanical equipment would be
rehabilitated, the workshop would be
refurbished, and tools and equipment for
maintenance would be provided.
(ii)   The Transmission and Distribution Network
would be rehabilitated, one of the transmis-
sion lines between Owen Falls and Kampala
would be uprated, and the transmission lines
between Kampala and Nkenda, and between Tororo
and Lira would be strengthened.
(iii)  These components would be supported through
the provision of vehicles, tools and equipment
for maintenance and repair services and
through the rehabilitation of UEB's Staff
Training Center and UEB's operational build-
ings and staff housing and the implementation
of a Training Study. Engineering and consult-
ing services for construction supervision
would also be provided.
(iv)   The Project would also include studies of
UEB's tariff structure and level and billing
and collection system, and the provision of a
computer for UEB. In addition, technical
assistance would be provided focusing on the
new Energy Department, on a forest and
fuelwood plantation inventory, on fuelwood
marketing, and on a household energy survey in
major towns of Uganda.

Project Benefits:     The proposed Project would prevent the development of
a bottleneck in power supplies that would hinder
economic recovery in the medium term. It would also
strengthen UEB's operational capability and contri-
bute to future development of the power system
through engineering and design work for the next
hydroelectric project to be built in Uganda.
Project Risks:        The main risk affecting the Project is the ability of
the Government to maintain security in the areas that
will be traversed by transmission and distribution
system to be rehabilitated under the Project. In
addition to the physical security risk for work crews
and equipment, there is also the risk that prospec-
tive contractors might add a risk premium to their
bids or that they may suffer losses in case of
security incidents. In order to keep this risk low,
contracts will contain provisions to protect
contractors adequately.

I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Introduction
1.01      Eight years of military government followed by war devastated the
Ugandan economy.   A concerted international effort in which the Bank
participated was launched after the end of hostilities in 1979 to help
reconstruct the economy.  Initially the unsettled political situation and
administrative inertia hampered the reconstruction efforts.   In 1981 a
major devaluation of the exchange rate was introduced and was accompanied
by the removal of most price controls and by the introduction of various
measures to improve monetary and fiscal discipline.   Building on these
reforms, the Government established a recovery program from July 1982 to
June 1984 which mapped out a coherent strategy, embracing macroeconomic and
sectorial policies as well as individual projects.   This program was
revised in October 1983 and has as its basic objective the rehabilitation
of the productive sectors and the improvement of the utilization of
existing productive capacities.
Principal Sector Issues
1.02       The UNDP/World Bank Energy Assessment Report 1/ identified the
issues and made recommendations for the sector policies and development
which were endorsed by the Government.   This constituted the first step
toward the implementation of a national strategy in the energy sector since
the end of the civil war.
1.03      The main issues identified were:  (a) the high cost of petroleum
imports; (b) relatively low efficiency in the use of petroleum products and
woodfuels; (c) distortions in retail prices of petroleum products and
shortcomings in the retail pricing formula; (d) unreliability of power
supply and high power system losses; (e) shortfall in power generation
capacity to meet forecast demand beyond the mid-1980s; (f) low level of
power tariffs and inappropriate tariff structure; (g) insufficient supply
of fuelwood, especially in the Kampala/Entebbe region; (h) inadequate level
of stumpage fees; and (i) lack of sectorwide coordination and planning.
Energy Resources
1.04       Uganda has ample water and forest resources for energy develop-
ment.   It has the disadvantages common to many African countries which
import all of their petroleum products.   No petroleum or gas has been
discovered but the Government is promoting prospects for exploration by
oil companies.   There is no coal;  peat exists but has not justified
exploitation.     Geothermal  sources  and  uranium  prospects  have  been
identified, but the former has low priority because of the great
hydroelectric potential; assessment of the uranium potential is in
progress.

report of the Joint UNDP/World Bank Energy Assessment Program.

Renewable Energy Resources
Fuelvood
1.05      In Uganda, as in many African countries, woodfuels contribute the
main supply of energy to the population.   Uganda's forests and woodlands
are estimated to cover 2.76 million hectares, or 12% of the country's total
area.  The energy assessment report recommended that a national inventory
be made, complemented by a survey of consumption trends and projections for
all wood products in order to identify the areas of critical shortage.
Funds have been secured for an inventory of forest plantations in southwest
Uganda, and are forthcoming for an inventory of natural forest reserves in
the same area.   The two inventories would cover about 40Z of Uganda's
forest resources. An inventory of natural forest resources is included in
the proposed project.   Agreement was reached during negotiations on the
program for this inventory to be conducted according to terms of reference
acceptable to the Association.
1.06       The energy assessment report made several other recommendations,
including the following: (i) that fuelwood plantations be expanded on the
basis of a supply and demand forecast - Care International (US$447,000),
the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) (US$53,000), the European
Economic Community (EEC) and International Labor Organization (ILO) have
rural social forestry projects toward this goal; (ii) that fuelvood and
industrial support plantations be established in the Kampala/Entebbe region
- no action has been taken; (iii) that extension services in fuelwood
plantations be improved - Government is seeking EEC assistance and (iv)
that the stumpage fee be raised to reflect the economic value of wood - a
proposal has been prepared by the Forestry Department (para. 1.17). One of
the priorities for Government is the preparation of a household energy
strategy.   The proposed project includes a provision for two surveys
covering fuelwood marketing arrangements and urban household energy demand
to complement the forest inventory work (para. 1.05) as inputs for the
preparation of a household energy strategy. Agreement was reached during
negotiations on the program for executing these studies according to terms
of reference acceptable to the Association.
Hydroelectric Resources
1.07       Uganda is well-endowed with hydroelectric potential.  Although
sites on a number of rivers have been studied, the potential is
concentrated on the Victoria Nile with its unlimited storage provided by
Lake Victoria. The Nile falls into three sections in Uganda, namely Lake
Victoria to Lake Kyoga and Lake Kyoga to Lake Albert (Victoria Nile), and
Lake Albert to the Sudanese border at Nimule (Albert Nile).   The last
section is remote from the load centers and has the least power potential.
The difference in elevation between Lakes Victoria and Albert is about 516
meters, of which 103 meters lie between Lake Victoria and Kyoga and 413
meters between Lakes Kyoga and Albert. The available head is concentrated
in seven locations, with a total potential capacity of about 1,745 MW and
annual firm generation capability of about 10,200 GWh (Annex 1). Although
the hydroelectric potential is substantial and relatively low-cost by world
standards, the potential can be developed only in increments that are large



-3-
relative to the size of the Ugandan demand, and therefore the potential for
substantial exports to neighboring countries is a significant factor in
determining the economics of development.
Other Renewable Energy Resources
1.08      The assessment report recommended that studies should be made of
the economics of new renewable energy options such as geothermal and solar
energy, use of crop residues, alcohol, biogas, wind, peat and papyrus.
1.09        Uganda's geothermal potential has not been studied since 1971
when a UNDP study concluded that it might be about 450 MW. Hydropower has
taken priority over further geothermal activities due to relative ease of
exploitation, greater potential and therefore, cost advantage. To promote
the use of crop residues, a USAID-funded pilot project for producing
charcoal from coffee husks has been commissioned recently near Jinja.
Makerere University is involved in a number of research programs in various
forms of renewable energy: biogas production and utilization; solar water
heating for industrial and commercial applications; solar drying for food
preservation; and solar crop drying.   In addition, the Forest Research
Center is engaged in research on charcoal production techniques.   These
modest programs were originally financed by the Overseas Development
Administration (ODA, United Kingdom) and attempts are now being made by the
National Research Council to obtain additional funds to continue the work
under a restructured program.   Although most of the projects described
above are still in the research stage, there are indications that some,
such as biogas production, have reached a stage where initiation of field
trials may be justified as a prerequisite to dissemination of the
techntology, for which appropriate extension mechanisms would need to be
developed.
Energy Demand and Supplv
1.10      Per capita energy consumption in Uganda is estimated to have been
0.35 toe during 1980, of which only 0.06 toe was commercial, i.e. petroleum
products, electricity and marketed wood fuels exclusive of woodfuels
gathered as a free good.   This level of commercial energy consumption,
while exceptionally low by world standards, is comparable to estimates for
some other low-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.  In Uganda's case,
the low level of commercial energy consumption reflects not only the
country's low per capita income, but also the dominance of the subsistence
sector and the significant decline in the industrial and transport sectors
during the 1970s. For the same reasons, energy consumption is concentrated
in  the  household  sector  and  supplied  primarily  from  woodfuels.
Electricity, which is the major area of government involvement in the
energy sector, has never supplied more than 4X of commercial energy
consumption.    In  terms of primary supply,  in  1980,  76% of Uganda's
commercial energy was domestically produced from woodfuels, with the
balance coming from imported petroleum products.  The energy balance for
1980 is summarized below and detailed in Annex 2.

1.11       Since mid-1981 the Government has introduced a number of major
policy reforms, including devaluation of the Ugandan shilling and related
price adjustments. These measures have contributed towards a recovery in
economic performance over the past two years. The impact of this recovery
on commercial energy consumption has so far been constrained principally by
higher energy prices. The declining trend of commercial energy consumption
which has been evident since 1970 is now reversing. Even with pessimistic
assumptions on the pace of recovery, the forecast growth rate of commercial
energy demand averages 4.8% per year over the remainder of the 1980s.
Total imports of energy-related petroleum products increased at an average
annual rate of 3.6% between 1981 and 1983.
1.12      Imported Energy:  Petroleum.  Uganda imports all of its petroleum
requirements, either by refining crude through the Mombasa refinery or by
direct purchases on the Keayan and Middle East markets. White products are
transported to Nairobi by pipeline and on to Kampala by rail or road (more
than 90% were transported by road in 1982 compared to only 20% in the early
1970s).   The six oil companies operating in Uganda maintain their own
storage facilities as well as retail outlets. In line with the pattern of
economic activity, distribution and consumption of petroleum products is
concentrated around Kampala (which accounts for 60% of all gasoline and
auto diesel sales) and Jinja (which accounts for 80% of fuel oil sales).
In 1983, the transport sector accounted for 75% of consumption of petroleum
products while the industrial and domestic sectors consumed 14% and 11%
respectively. The complex import and marketing arrangements for petroleum
products were reviewed in the energy aseessment report, and four
alternatives were recommended to minimize the foreign exchange costs of
these supplies: diversification of supply sources, reduction in transport
costs to the Ugandan border, development of new supply routes and
maintenance of a product stockpile.
1.13      The Petroleum Desk was established in 1982 in the Bank of Uganda
as a subsector unit responsible for monitoring petroleum imports.   The
Ministry of Power, Posts and Telecommunmications (MPPT) is responsible for
formulation of policy. The Government and the oil companies operating in
Uganda have diversified supply sources for petroleum products through
purchases on the Middle East market as well as processing crude oil through
the Mombasa Refinery. A second route through Tanzania in addition to the



-5-
Kenyan route has been tried and determined to be viable.   The minimum
safety stockpile has been increased from about two weeks consumption to the
equivalent of four to five weeks based on present consumption levels.

1.14        An air-mag survey recommended in the assessment report, has
identified prospective areas of petroleum excploration and Government has
offered prospective acreage to oil companies interested in exploration in
Uganda.   The proposed Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project which has
been appraised for Bank financing would help Government build a Petroleum
Unit that could competently deal with the oil companies, evaluate
exploration bids, negotiate agreements and monitor exploration activities.
Energy Prices and Pricing Policy
1.15        Petroleum Products.  Retail prices for all energy sources in
Uganda declined in real terms during the 1970s and contributed to a general
deterioration of efficiency in the sector, and escalated the smuggling of
petroleum  products  to  neighboring  countries.    The  assessment  report
recommended that the prices of petroleum products should be adjusted with
major changes in the exchange rate to reflect their economic cost of
supply. This has been done regularly since late 1982 and after the price
increases announced in December 1984, petroleum prices at that time
corresponded to the economic cost of supply.
1.16       Electricity.  Up to mid-1984, tariffs were among the lowest in
the world and far below the long run economic costs of supply (para. 6.12)
despite three 50% increases since early 1982.  In 1983 the average sales
price to Ugandan consumers was equivalent to about US cents l/kWh. However
by the time of appraisal of the proposed power rehabilitation project in
mid 1984 the average price had declined to the equivalent of US cents
0.5/kWh due to devaluation of the Ugandan currency, and it was determined
that without an immediate tariff increase of between 400% and 500%, the
Ugandan Electricity Board (UEB) would not be able to meet its operating
costs and service its debt for the remainder of 1984 and 1985.   The
Government subsequently authorized and UEB has put into effect as of
August 1, 1984 tariffs that were considcred to be sufficient to meet these
needs. The tariff rate still remains low by world standards, yielding an
average revenue from Ugandan consumers equivalent to US cents 1.5/kWh in
late 1984. The tariff rate is also still well below the long-run marginal
cost of meeting increases in demand above existing supply capacity in
Uganda.   A firm estimate of the  long-run marginal cost will not be
available until the ongoing Power Development Study on future hydroelectric
development in Uganda (para. 2.27) and the proposed tariff study included
in this project  (para.  6.13) have been completed.   However, a broad
estimate of this cost, equivalent to about US cents 5/kWh, was derived in
the energy assessment report.  The bulk tariff   for supplies to Kenya,
which are fixed by a fifty year supply contract executed in 1955, is also
far below the long run marginal costs (paras.2.11 and 5.12).   In 1983
Uganda exported 218 GWh to Kenya - 46% of its total power sales.



1.17        Woodfuels.   In the woodfuels subsector the Government's major
concern is the high level of retail prices for households, especially in
Kampala. The assessment report recommended raising the stumpage fee for
forests serving urban areas from USh 200/m3 to at least USh 1,000/m3
(equivalent to about US cents 0.5 to 2.5/,m3 at 1984 prices).  Since the
stumpage fee is such a small component of total costs, no significant
impact on retail prices was envisioned and, in the final analysis, the most
effective way to reduce retail prices for woodfuels would be to improve
supply. The Forestry Department has partially accepted this recommendation
and is preparing a proposal to raise the fee to USh 500/m3 (US cents
1.25/30).
Energy Sector Organization
1.18          The major institutions of the sector are the MPPT, UEB,
(para. 2.03), the Bank of Uganda (petroleum importation and marketing,
para. 1.13), the Forestry Department in the Ministry of Agriculture and
Forestry, the Geological Survey and Mines Department (GSMD) in the Ministry
of Lands, Minerals and Water Resources, and the National Research Council
in  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Economic  Developoent  (MPED).    The
importation and marketing of petroleum products in Uganda is handled by six
oil companies in three of which the Government has equal shareholdings with
non-government partners.
1.19        To facilitate energy policy coordination and  .ntegrated sector
planning, the Government has established an Energy Department in MPPT.
Sufficient staff positions to allow the start of operations have been
approved, and recruitment of staff for the Department has been initiated.
In the interim, energy policy will be coordinated by a nucleus staff within
MPPT, MPED and the subsector institutions.   To assist  in putting the
Department on a sound footing, the Government requested technical
assistance under the joint UNDP/World Bank Energy Sector Management
Assistance Program (ESMAP) for an Energy Sector Institutional Review
focussing primarily on the formation and operation of the Department. The
Bank mission visited Uganda in June 1984 and has prepared a report 2/
outlining the technical assistance which is proposed to be a part of this
project and which has been approved by Government.  During negotiations,
agreement was obtained that Government will take measures to strengthen the
Energy Department along the lines recommended by the ESMAP report.
1.20        In conjunction with this review, a proposal has been made for
specialists in the areas of petroleum supply, pricing and forecasting to
support the Petroleum Section of the proposed Energy Department.   The
Petroleum Desk in the Bank of Uganda and the Ministry of Finance would also
be involved (para. 1.13).
Government Strategy in the Energy Sector
1.21      On the basis of the Energy Assessment Report, the Government has
embarked on a strategy for the energy sector which includes the following
activities. (a) It is attempting energy efficiency improvements under the
Bank's Industrial Rehabilitation Credit (Credit 1248-UG of May 18, 1982).
2/   UGANDA:   Institutional Strengthening in the Energy Sector", January,
1985, a report prepared under ESMAP (UNDP/World Bank Energy Sector
Management Assistance Program).



-7-
During the last year and a half, these efforts have remained largely in the
study phase, although in a few cases implementation has been initiated,
including a number of fuel substitution efforts involving conversion to
heavier fuel oil and bagasse; (b) Energy-related rehabilitation efforts in
the transport sector aimed at reducing specific fuel consumption through
improvements in vehicle maintenance and repair facilities, training of
drivers  and  mechanics,  railway  track  repair  and  regrading,  and
rehabilitation of road networks;  (c) the Goverament has also taken steps
to  strengthen  the  institutional  capability  of  the  energy  sector
(para. 1.19) and to seek technical assistance for priority activities in
the energy sector.
Bank Strategy in the Energy Sector
1.22        The Bank's lending strategy for Uganda is to concentrate on
rehabilitation needs in the short term to finance immediate import
requirements and to support the Government's efforts to reform economic
policies and institutions, and to focus this assistance increasingly on
projects designed to restore the country's productive capacity, basic
infrastructure and institutions. Energy is one of the main targets of the
Bank's sectoral coverage.
1.23      The background to the proposed project and the terms of reference
for the Power Development Study and the feasibility study for the next
generation site (para. 2.27) were included in the assessment report. The
report also proposed technical assistance in other energy subsectors;
follow up of these proposals has been described above (paras. 1.13-1.15).
Other areas identified in the report have been discussed with the
Government for assistance from ESMAP, particularly the institutional review
of the requirements for establishment of an Energy Department in the MPPT
(para. 1.19). A petroleum exploration and promotion project based on the
results of the air-mag survey has been appraised (para. 1.14).

II. THE POWER SUBSECTOR
Background
2.01      Uganda's considerable hydroelectric potential was first assessed
seriously during the 1930s and 1940s. Construction of the first and only
major hydroelectric development in the country was started in 1948, and
consisted of a dam and power station at Owen Falls located at Jinja on the
Victoria Nile river near to the only outlet of Lake Victoria (Map IBRD
18542). The lake provides a reservoir of almost infinite capacity to the
dam. The planned ten 15 MW turbo-generating sets were commissioned from
1954 to 1968 (two each in years 1954, 1955 and 1957 and one each in 1958,
1959, 1966 and 1968), bringing the total installed capacity at the station
to 150 MW. The initial transmission system was also commissioned in 1954,
consisting of a line westwards from Jinja to Kampala. Another line going
eastwards to Tororo and Mbale was constructed in 1957.
2.02      On its establishment in 1948, UEB acquired small steam generating
sets installed by rhe East African Power and Lighting Company to serve
Kampala, Entebbe and Jinja. Consumption during the Board's first year of
operation was less than 7 GWh, and this was distributed to 3,000
consumers. Following the commissioning of the Owen Falls station, UEB has
extended the supply area of the main power system westwards from Kampala
and northwards from Tororo, often displacing isolated diesel-powered
generating units which were relocated to serve new isolated load centers.
Uganda Electricity Board (UEB)
2.03    UEB was established in 1948 by the Uganda Electricity Ordinance to
acquire and operate existing electricity undertakings and to generate,
transmit, distribute and supply electricity for Uganda. This Ordinance was
replaced by the Electricity Ordinance, 1961, the administrative and
financial provisions of which took into account the amendments required by
the loan agreement with IBRD (Loan 279-UG of March 28, 1961, para. 2.14).
After Uganda attained independence, this Ordinance was reenacted by the
Electricity Act 1964 which is presently in operation. In accordance with
the provisions of the Act, the functions and duties of UEB are to generate,
transmit, distribute and supply electricity and to establish, acquire,
maintain and operate undertakings for that purpose.   The Act provides
adequate autonomy to UEB to serve the country of Uganda and to export power
to neighboring countries.
Generation
2.04      Uganda's public installed generation capacity is operated by UEB,
and presently totals 154.9 14W of which 150 MW is provided by the Owen Falls
hydroelectric station.  The balance is made up of small diesel stations
(total 3.9 MW) in the northern and western regions and one small
hydroelectric station at Kabale (1.0 MW) (Annex 3).  The diesel units in
the West Nile region are not in service because of lack of spare parts.
The remaining four diesel stations generated 4.2 GWh in 1981. In addition,
there are some small hydro and diesel power stations installed, owned and
operated by industries. These captive plants are very small (except for



-9-
the hydro station at Kilembe Mines which currently is out of operation but
is being uprated from 7 MW to 12 MW), and due to lack of spare parts most
of them have been inoperative in recent years.   The country's average
annual generation capability is about 900 GWh and is almost wholly provided
by the Owen Falls hydroelectric station.
2.05       The Owen Falls power station contains 10 turbines of 21,000 HP
rating and umbrella type alternators of 16.7 MYA each which have a
design capability of 15 MW at a design head of 18.9 m and at a power factor
of 0.9. One unit is considered to be the system reserve requirement, and
thus the firm capacity of the station is considered to be 135 MW. Due to
the difficulties of the past decade, UEB has only been able to carry out
routine maintenance, and the turbo-generating units bave not had a major
overhaul since installation (the units are 16 to 30 years old). Thus, the
present firm capacity of the station is substantially below its rated firm
capacity of 135 MW. At the time of the appraisal mission in mid 1984, four
of the ten units were not in operation, and two of these four units require
major overhaul before they can be restored to service.   The proposed
rehabilitation project includes measures to restore these units to service
without which UEB would be unable to fully meet the demand on its system in
the near future.
Transmission and Distribution
2.06       The transmission network in Uganda (Map IBRD 18542) consists of
overhead transmission lines and substations operated at 132, 66 and 33 kV,
and is supplied from the Owen Falls power station.   The 132 kV lines
connect Owen Falls power station to Nkenda in the west (near Kasese)
passing by Kampala, Masaka in the southwest, Tororo in the east and Lira in
the north. A 132 kV line connects the Kenyan system to the Ugandan system
at Tororo substation where sales to Kenya are metered. The double circuit
132 kV line between the Kenyan border and Kampala (via Tororo and Owen
Falls) and the 66 kV line between Owen Falls and Kampala are carried on
steel towers.0ther overhead lines are carried on wooden poles. The
distribution system in towns is mainly by means of 33 and 11 kV
transmission lines on wooden poles except in the major towns of Kampala,
Jinja and Mbale where a small part of the system is carried by underground
cables.  Major consumers are supplied at 11 kV and 33 kV, while local
supplies to small consuners and individual houses are derived from 33/11 kV
primary substations and from 11 kV/430V 3-phase distribution transformers.
Distribution in the isolated areas is from 11 kV lines on wooden poles.
The total length of the transmission and distribution lines at the end of
1981 was 9,951 km made up as follows:
Overhead    Underground    Total
-            km
132 and 66 kV               1,203            -        1,203

Total                  9,739         212         9,951



- 10 -
The total transmission transformer capacity was 395 MVA, made up as
follows:
Installed
Primary                 Transformer
Voltage                  Capacity
(kV)                      (MVA)
132                      222.5
66                       42.5
33                      130.0
Total        395.0
2.07        The transmission system is controlled from the control center
located at Owen Falls Power Station.   As the system is supplied by one
source, any fault in the power station results in total loss of supply
throughout the country and to Kenya. Total loss of generation at the Owen
Falls power station has been experienced many times, although the duration
has never exceeded about two hours. The transmission system has no loops,
which reduces the security of supply to outlying areas. Some transmission
lines are very long and pass through unpopulated areas; this makes them
difficult to maintain, expecially with UEB's presently depleted transport
and bush-clearing facilities, and operationally unreliable.   The 132 kV
lines between Kampala and Nkenda and between Tororo and Lira have been
subject to numerous breakdowns causing substantial economic cost to
industrial and agroindustrial plants served from these lines. The project
would assist to remedy these problems through strengthening of the lines
and provision of transport and bush-clearing equipment. The distribution
networks of the main towns such as Kampala and Tororo are reaching their
capacities and voltage drops affect the operation of equipment such as
motors and TV sets. Local overloading of the distribution systems occurs
due to rising domestic demand, including illegal connections. Total system
losses have averaged about 16% of UEB's billings to Ugandan consumers for
1981-83. UEB is presently instituting some measures to reduce this level
through reduction of unaccounted consumption apart from technical losses,
and the proposed project includes additional measures (para. 3.18).  The
power factor is low (about 65%). Since the system has not been loaded to
its capacity (except for some towns), these features have not been
significant so far for system operations. However, this situation has to
be remedied before system demand rises beyond the present rated level of
system supply capability, estimated to occur about 1988 or sooner if the
generating units at Owen Falls Power Station are not rehabilitated in time,
in order  to avoid  serious power  shortages.   After  rehabilitation  is
completed, system supply capability will meet demand through 1991.
Power System Rehabilitation
2.08       Due to scarcity of financial resources, both local and foreign,
UEB's construction and maintenance program has been very limited since
1968.   In recent years priority has been given to repairing the system,
using whatever materials were available.  This repair service was under-
taken on a small scale.  Despite reasonable success in maintaining power
supply, UEB has not been able to undertake a major system reconstruction
program. UEB has been assisted in transmission system repairs, especially
in areac; hit by war, by grants under the Government's recovery program,
totalling US$6.9 million, which have been used for i) the procurement of
spare parts for maintenance of generating units; ii) repairs to destroyed



- 11 -
iv)  repairs  to  the  communication  system.    However,  these  -inancial
resources were not enough to cover all rehabilitation requirements. UEB's
need for vehicles, communication equipment and spares for the system is so
acute that a list of emergency materials and equipment has been prepared
for financing from IDA's Second Reconstruction Credit.
Connections to the UEB System
2.09        The total number of connections in mid-1984 on UEB's billing
records was  about  106,000.    Of  this  total,  connections  to  domestic
consumers accounted for about 75,000, commercial consumers about 30,200 and
industrial and other consumers about 800. However, these totals include a
category which UEB terms "nil consumers", which represents connections for
which there has been no consumption registered on meters on successive
readings.    Such meters,  according  to UEB,  are generally in  deserted
buildings.   The billing record shows about 49,000  'nil consumers" in
mid-1984, about 46% of total connections.   This situation is a legacy of
the disturbances in Uganda during 1979-81 and of the lack of accountability
of certain sections of the population during the military regime. UEB has
set up a special section to check whether these connections are genuinely
defunct accounts and, if so, to disconnect the supply.  A review of the
billing and connection records is included in the proposed project
(para. 3.19).
Access to Service
2.10         Analysis of UEB's billing records indicate that the active
connections to residential consumers totaled about 40,000 in mid-1984.
Assuming an average household size of six, the number of people having
access to electricity is estimated to be about 250,000, which is only 2% of
the total population.   However, the proportion of the population in the
major urban centers that is connected to the UEB system ranges from 15 to
20%. Per capita consumption of electricity in 1982 was only 23 kWh, one of
the lowest levels in the world. 3/  However, this reflects not only the
limited access to electricity but also the impact of declining economic
activity over the previous decade.   In the late 1960s, for example, per
capita consumption of electricity was more than double the present level.

Sales to Kenya
2.11        In 1955 Uganda contracted to supply Kenya with firm power of
45 MW for 50 years starting in 1958.   The incentive for Uganda was a
substantial excess of generation capacity over Ugandan demand. The export
of Ugandan power provides a needed source of foreign exchange while
providing low cost power to Kenya.  This agreement was modified in 1964
under which the contracted supply of firm power was reduced to 30 MW and
Kenya was committed to maintaining a minimum load factor of 90X.  Since
1981, Kenya has altered its pattern of demand on the Ugandan system, taking
substantially less than 30 MW during the period of peak daily load on the
Ugandan system from Ugandan demand, while drawing a maximum load of
substantially more than 33 MW during the nightly off-peak period. In 1981,
which was a year of low Kenya hydroelectric output, maximum Kenyan demand
reached 71 MW during the Ugandan off-peak period.  During 1984, maximum
Kenyan demand has reached 63 MW at night.   There has been a noticeable
increase in Kenyan maximum demand from March 1984 due to the effect of the
present drought in Kenya on its hydropower production. The use of Ugandan
power limits the drawdown of Kenya's steadily declining reservoir storage
as well as the need for costly thermal generation.   This practice, while
never put on a formal basis, has worked to the advantage of both
countries. For Uganda, it has reduced the possibility of demand exceeding
system supply capability during the peak load periods, and it has allowed
Uganda to earn sales revenue from hydroelectric energy generated at
nighttime that would otherwise be spilled. Exports to Kenya have accounted
for a substantial proportion of UEB's revenues (44% in 1983), even though
the contract price for this power is very low (para. 5.12). During 1984,
Kenya may have had to reduce its demand on the UEB system during the
Ugandan peak periods due to capacity limitations at the Owen Falls station
(para. 2.23) which could indicate that demand on the UEB system is already
being constrained.
2.12       Ugandan power exports to Kenya remained within 260 and 300 GWh
per year between 1971 and 1978, except for 1976 when it dropped to 237 GWh,
thus showing remarkable consistency during a period of strained relations
between Uganda and Kenya. Currently imports from Uganda account for about
11% of total supply in Kenya and 44% of total output in Uganda.  Power
exports to Kenya fluctuated substantially between 1978 and 1983, with the
lowest levels of 165 GWh and 186 GWh occurring in 1979 and 1981, and the
highest level of 300 GWh occurring in 1980.   The explanation for these
fluctuations is the variation in availability of energy from hydropower
stations in Kenya, which produced their highest levels of output in 1979
and  1981,  and  substantially  lower  levels  in  1978 and  1980.    These
observations support the conclusion that Kenya has recently used Ugandan
imports as a balancing source between its own demand and supply.
Sales to Tanzania
2.13       The Government has recently agreed to construct a transmission
link with a capacity of 16 MW (126 GWh/year) for export to Tanzania along
the west side of Lake Victoria as far as Bukoba.   Financing is being
negotiated and the new transmission line and transformer station will be
completed during 1987 at the earliest, and the demand on the Uganda system
from this region is forecast to be substantially below the transmission
line  capacity  for some years after commissioning.    TLie cost  of  the



- 13 -
this transmission line will be financed by the Italian Government. Uganda
is negotiating a bulk tariff with Tanzania and will use data from the Power
Development Study for this purpose.
Previous Bank Lending in the Power Sector
2.14       The Bank made a loan to UEB in 1961 of US$8.4 million equivalent
(Loan 279-UG) for the expansion and improvement of the transmission and
distribution system and construction of small hydroelectric and diesel
plants and distribution networks to supply isolated areas.
Government Strategy in the Power Sector
2.15       Government is presently implementing an economic rehabilitation
program. Due to the presence of resource constraints, this program has to
be based on low levels of investment in new production capacity. Instead,
the emphasis in resource allocation is on recurrent financing of
maintenance and operations, and on priority rehabilitation projects.   To
counteract inflationary pressures and strangulation of economic recovery,
it will be necessary to concentrate on the removal of bottlenecks in
infrastructure that will develop with growth in economic activity. In the
case of power, the Government plans to develop the country's advantage of
abundant and relatively low-cost hydroelectric potential for export to
neighboring countries.
2.16       The proposed project is designed as part of the rehabilitation
component of this strategy, together with the emerge;.cy assistance provided
ahead of this project (para. 2.08).  The groundwork for implementing the
second part of the strategy, namely development of infrastructure, is
currently underway with the preparation of the Power Development Study
(para. 2.27). This study will determine the least-cost power development
program, taking into account Uganda's comparative advantage in power
production in the region, and it will identify the economically optimum
location of the next major hydroelectric development in Uganda.
Bank Strategy in the Power Sector
2.17       The Bank has an important role to play in promoting policy and
institutional reform as well as providing additional resources for the
power sector.   The Bank's role is to bring about improvements to power
system reliability and efficiency, to strengthen UEB's management, to
promote rational pricing policies and sound financial performance, to
ensure power system development in accordance with the least-cost option
and to assist Uganda in exploiting its comparative advantage in
hydroelectric resources for developing power exports.
2.18          The Bank is also following a strategy of encouraging the
development of regional projects where these projects have the potential to
benefit all the countries concerned.   Funds  (US$2 million)  have been
included in the loan to Kenya for the Olkaria Geothermal Power Expansion
Project (LN 2237-KE of January 22, 1980) for the revision of the long-term
development program, considering among other options the future role of
imports from neighboring countries for the benefit of both importing and
exporting countries. The Power Development Study (para. 2.27) will examine
the costs to Uganda of such developments and provide a basis for
discussions with neighboring governments.

Historic Demand
2.19         Demand for electrical energy in Uganda declined steadily at
nearly 7% per year between 1971 and 1979, dropping from 452 GWh to 235 &Wh,
and remained at that level in 1980 as economic activity was disrupted by
the war of liberation and its aftermath.  Demand increased by 20% in 1981
and remained at the 1981 level during 1982, declining in 1983 by 12X
(Annex 4). Preliminary data indicate that demand in 1984 will be 15 to 20%
higher than in 1983, and is at an equivalent annual level of nearly
300 GWh. The maximum load from Ugandan consumers decreased by about 4% per
year from 97.0 MW in 1971 to 69.4 MW in 1979, and then increased at about
6% per year to 88.4 MW in 1983. The maximum load had increased further to
about 95 MW by mid-1984.  Thus Ugandan energy demand (GWh) is currently
only about 65% of the level reached in 1971, whereas the maximum load (MW)
from Ugandan consumers has recovered almost to the 1971 level.
2.20       Industrial demand suffered the greatest decline out of the major
consumption categories during the period of economic decline, dropping by
1979 to 35% of its level in 1971.   Commercial demand declined by 37Z
between 1971 and 1979, and residential demand in 1979 was at the same level
as in 1971. Conversely, during the subsequent period of economic recovery
(1981-83), industrial demand increased by 26%,commercial demand declined by
29% and residential demand declined by 22%. The decline in consumption in
the residential and commercial categories may reflect the squeeze on real
household incomes which accompanied measures to remove massive price
distortions throughout the economy that were inherited from the military
regime. In 1983 the sectoral composition of demand was 37% industrial, 22%
commercial, 40% residential and 1% street lighting, compared to 64%, 17%,
18% and 1% respectively in 1971.
2.21       The average annual consumption of power per active residential
connection (specific consumption) in Uganda is estimated to be about
3,000 kWh in 1984. This rate is high by African urban standards. Analysis
of UEB's billing records for 1982 (Annex 4) shows that the 15% of
connections with the highest specific consumption (over 6,000 kWh/year)
accounted for about 70% of total residential consumption.   This group of
consumers numbers about 6,000 and has an average specific consumption of
about 15,000 kWh/year which is high even by the standards of industrialized
economies.   The probable explanation is that this group is composed of
consumers whose consumption is not sensitive to the cost of electricity,
such as consumers whose electricity bills are paid by their employers or by
Government.   The remaining 30% of residential consumption  is supplied
through about 34,000 active connections which have an average specific
consumption of about 1,000 kWh per year.   However,  the expenditure on
electricity by this group is estimated to average less than 4% of household
income at the tariff rates in force after the increase effective from
August 1984. Thus the increase to this tariff level is unlikely to have a
significant impact on residential consumption. Most of the consumption by
commercial and industrial consumers is not significantly sensitive to the
price of electricity since power costs will remain a small portion of
operating costs.
2.22      The maximum output of power from Owen Falls hydroelectric station
to serve the simultaneous maximum demand from Uganda and exports to Kenya
occurred in 1968 and amounted to 132 MW, equalling 86% of installed
capacity and 98% of firm capacity. The maximum energy generated from the



- 15 -
station totalled 816 GWh in 1971.  The station has an annual generation
capacity of 900 GWh based on an installed capacity of 150 MW and the firm
flow rate of the Victoria Nile adopted for planning purposes of
630 m3/sec.  Thus in 1971, the maximum energy output of the station had
reached 91% of the generation capacity.
2.23        At the 1983 levels of output, the plant factor of Owen Falls
power station was 80% of its firm capacity and 57% of annual firm energy
availability, assuming that nine of the ten generating units were always in
operation. In practice, the average availability of units during 1983 was
less than nine, and the plant factor was higher than 80%.  During 1984,
when only six units have been available with a combined rated output of
90 MW, the station has produced up to 97 MW, giving a plant factor of over
100%.  The units were able to deliver an output above their rating without
suffering damage because their delivery capability is greater than their
rating. 4/  Nevertheless, the supply/demand balance is critical, and UEB
has to restore to operation the units that are out of service to meet any
increase in demand even in the short term.
Forecast Demand
2.24      Demand for electrical energy in Uganda is forecast to increase at
an average annual rate of about 9% between 1983 and 1991 (Annex 5), with
sales rising from 251 GWh to 537 GWh. Including projected export sales to
Kenya and Tanzania, based on present supply commitments total demand for
energy on the UEB system is forecast to increase at an average annual rate
of about 7%, with sales rising from 516 GWh in 1983 to 926 GWh in 1991.
The maximum load on the UEB system from Ugandan consumers is forecast to
increase at 5% annually, rising from 85 MW in 1983 to 132 MW in 1991. The
lower growth rate in forecast maximum load compared to energy demand
reflects the assumption that commercial and industrial growth will be
achieved in the next few years largely through increasing the utilization
of existing capacity rather than the introduction of new production
capacity, in accordance with the strategy of the Government's Recovery
Program.   There is considerable uncertainty about the future degree of
coincidence of the timing of the load from Kenya with the maximum daily
load from Ugandan consumers, since at present the Kenya Power and Light
Company (KP&L) appears to be following a policy of using Ugandan power
primarily during off-peak periods (para. 2.11).
2.25       The forecast of steadily increasing demand from 1984 onwards is
based on the assumption that the Ugandan economy is on a recovery course
that will lead into sustained growth in the medium term, and that the
long-term decline  in electricity  consumption has been  reversed.    The
evidence for the reversal of economic decline is provided by a number of
indicators, particularly GD? which since 1980 has increased at an average
annual rate of 6.5%. The main source of growth in the past few years has
4/  From non-destructive testing of a turbo-generator unit soon after its
commissioning in the mid-1960's, the manufacturers of the units
established that the generators had the capability to deliver up to
nearly 18 MW for short periods, although the design rating was limited
to 15 MW.



- 16 -
been the increased output of export crops which has not had a marked effect
on electricity consumption. Continuation of GDP growth requires
substantial contribution from other sectors, particularly in industrial
output which suffered proportionately the greatest sectoral decline In
electricity consumption between 1971 and 1983.  Demand for electricity in
Industrial and commercial sectors is closely related to the level of
activity  in  these sectors.    Nevertheless,  the  relative  importance of
industrial demand in total system demand is likely to remain less than
during the historical peak period of economic development in Uganda around
1970. As a result, when demand once again reaches the historic peak level,
forecast to occur by 1987/88, the geographical distribution of demand in
Uganda will be significantly different, with a marked displacement westward
due to the relative increase in importance of the Government, residential
and commercial demands of Kampala/Entebbe region, and the relative decline
in the importance of the industrial demand in the Jinja area. The need for
additional transmission capacity west of Kampala depends on the future of
the Kilembe mining complex. One consequence will be the need to increase
the capacity of the transmission link from Jinja to Kampala, and the
proposed project includes a provision for uprating the existing 66 kV
transmission line between Jinja and Kampala to 132 kV.
UEB's Development Program
2.26         Although the proposed works at the Owen Falls hydroelectric
station are for rehabilitation, they will result in an uprating of capacity
by 20% (30 NW).   The manufacturers of the turbo-generations carried out
field inspections and it is their opinion that the rehabilitation of the
generators should enable the machines to be given a nameplate rating of 18
MW, compared to the present rating of 15 MW. However, the rating of the
turbo-generators is dictated by the cavitation limits on turbine operation
under prevailing hydraulic conditions, which refers to the level of Lake
Victoria and the hydraulic head in the case of the plant at Owen Falls.
The machines would have the capability of delivering 18 MW continuously
under appropriate hydraulic conditions, but actual rating of the machines
would be limited to 15-16 MW. If hydraulic conditions permit, the machines
zould be driven at 18 MW, but a close watch would have to be maintained for
the occurrence of cavitation. Thus, the firm capacity of the station after
rehabilitation (with nine units in service and one unit under maintenance)
would be considered as 162 MW for the short-term (until the next hydro
station is commissioned) and would remain at 135 MW for long-term planning
purposes.
2.27       To date Uganda does not have a least-cost development plan for
the power sector.   However, it is clear that the least-cost option for
timely development of generation capacity is the rehabilitation of Owen
Falls Station (para. 6.07).   This option constitutes one of  the main
components of the proposed Power II project.   The least-cost long-term
development program needs to be determined soon since demand is forecast to
exceed supply capability after rehabilitation of Owen Falls Station by the
end of 1991 (para. 6.01).   5/ The earliest date by which a new hydro
5/ The estimated date by which demand is forecast to exceed supply
capability is end 1991 on the assumption that the minimum contracted
supply (30 MW) to Kenya has to be delivered at the time of Ugandan peak
system demand.  In the stuation that this requirement is relaxed so
that Kenyan demand at the time of peak Ugandan system demand is limited
to Ugandan system supply capability, the uprated supply capability of
Owen Falls would be adequate up to 1994 to meet forecast demand.



- 17 -
station could be brought on-stream is about  1991.  6/   Government has
accepted an offer of assistance from ODA for the preparation of such a
long-term development plan in a Power Development Study.  The draft final
report is due to be delivered In mid 1985. Funds for the engineering work
for developing the site selected for the next hydroelectric station are
included in the proposed Power II project.
2.28       The location of the next major hydroelectric development is an
important issue for the Ugandan Government in view of the Government's
desire to promote developments in the northern part of the country and to
increase power exports. The economic justification for development of one
of the sites (para. 1.07) in the north of the country (Kabalega, Ayago or
Kamdini) rather than a site in the south (Bujagali, Busovoko or Kaligala)
would be enhanced if a substantial export contract for power is obtained
from Kenya, the only prospective market for a major export contract.
Government has decided in principle to proceed with Ayago as the site of
the next hydroelectric project. However, the Association will be consulted
on the development of the next hydroelectric development and the findings
of the Power Development Study (para. 2.27) will be taken into account to
ensure that the next project will be in accordance with the least-cost
development program for the power system.  The release of funds for the
engineering work for the next hydroelectric station from the proposed
Credit will be conditional on the Association's approval of the proposed
development.
2.29         UEB has prepared 14 projects with the aim of extending the
interconnected system to the main population centers which presently have
limited service supplied from inefficient diesel units or have no
electricity  at  all.      The  primary  objective  is  to  establish  the
infrastructural basis to stimulate economic development in those isolated
population centers and to provide amenities so as to curb emigration to the
towns. EEC is presently considering seven of these schemes for financing.
6/ This would allow two years for site selection, preparation of
feasibility studies, resource mobilization, final design, preparation
of bid documents and contracting arrangements, and up to five years for
construction.

III. THE BORROWER AND THE EXECUTING AGENCY
The Borrower
3.01      The Government of Uganda would be the Borrower.  The proceeds of
the proposed IDA Credit would be onlent to UEB (para. 5.19).
The Beneficiary and Executing Agency
3.02       The beneficiary and executing agency would be UEB, an autonomous
corporation established by the Uganda Electricity Board Ordinance of 1947
and reestablished by the Electricity Act of 1964.  UEB is accountable to
MPPT and responsible for the production, transmission and distribution of
public electricity supply in Uganda and, in accordance with agreement, the
export of electricity outside Uganda.   UEB has reasonable autonomy to
perform its functions.
3.03      The Board of Directors of UEB consists of a chairman who is chief
executive officer, and not less than five or more than eight other members,
who are appointed by the Minister of Power, Posts and Telecommunications.
Management and Staffing
3.04      UEB has remained a relatively effective institution when compared
with other Ugandan parastatals which experienced the same period of
particularly difficult problems. However, during the last ten to fifteen
years due to lack of funds, UEB has had difficulty in conducting its
construction and maintenance programs. It has successfully maintained the
power supply without adequate resoulrces and has become accustomed to
performing a limited program under close supervision of top management.
IDA  and  the  other  co-financiers  have  some  concern  that  the  present
organizational structure (Annex 6) will be adequate to effectively
administer a major program, as is envisioned in the proposed project, and
will be able to meet the challe-iges which will be encountered in the
implementation of a second major generating facility which is now under
consideration.   There also appears to be no planned succession for key
management positions. An in-depth study of the organizational requirements
of UEB is required to initiate major organizational changes, and it is
proposed that this study be financed through the Association's Second
Technical Assistance Credit (Credit 1434-UG of December 22, 1983).   The
request for use of technical assistance funds is being prepared so that the
study can be completed early in the p'-ject implementation period.  During
negotiations  agreement was  obtained  to  implement  the  findings  of  the
organizational study as soon as these findings have been determined and
agreed by Government, UEB and IDA.
3.05          UEE has a staff of about  2,600, of which about  150 are
professional level,  650 are intermediate technical level and 1,800 are
junior,  skilled  and  unskilled  workers.    With  the  exception  of  the
chairman/managing director, all staff are Ugandan.
3.06         Since the early 1960's, UEB has followed a routine two-year
review and selective training program of staff for all higher level
positions and most technicians to prepare them for higher management



- 19 -
responsibilities and to improve efficieucy.   This program has included
training abroad for 40 engineers and technicians since 1975. As a result,
UE2 is effectively staffed for the present level of operations. This has
been made possible through an adequate supply of personnel including
engineers from the Faculty of Technology at Makerere University,
technicians from the Uganda Technical Institute and artisans from a number
of  trade  schools.    Thus  for  thie  immediate  future,  including  the
implementation of the proposed project, the staffing situation is
satisfactory.
Training and Institutional Development
3.07          For the future,  the staffing situation is less certain.
Recruitment does not appear to pose a problem, but training of recruits and
existing staff in the modern technology that will be required to operate
the future new generating facilities involving more than one plant and to
initiate modern management techaiques in operations will require an
enlarged and upgraded training program and rehabilitation of the training
center at Owen Falls.
3.08      The emergency situation which has prevailed over the last ten to
fifteen years has constrained UEB to concentrate only on keeping the system
operating. Planniing and keeping abreast of development of new technologies
has been neglected. The present system has continued to be operated at a
technology level that is 20-30 years old. The main trainers of engineers
and technicians have also stagnated at a technology level that is far from
adequate with little training in computerized operations or techniques.
UEB internal and external training programs will have to be increased and
improved in scope,  administration and organization.   It is therefore
proposed that a study of UEB's training needs up to the year 1995 be
included in the project and financed by the IDA Credit. The study would
complement the Power Development Study (para. 2.27) and should include:
- an assessment of manpower requirements until 1995 giving special
attention to senior and intermediate levels;
- an assessment of the future sources of engineers, technicians and
artisans relative to both quantity and quality;
- an assessment of UEB's training program as to its capacity to
provide upgraded training to new recruits and existing staff in
the new skills required;
- make recommendations on the organization of a cost-effective
training program; and
- make recommendations on the establishment of a manpower
management Information system.
During negotiations agreement was obtained on the terms of reference for
the training study to be completed by June 30, 1986, and submitted for
Association comments by July 31, 1986.   Implementation of the studies
findings will be in accordance with a timetable whch will be acceptable to
UEB, GOU and the Association.



- 20 -
Iasurance
3.09        UEB's insurance coverage is adequate.   It includes fire and
extended coverage, burglary, cash fidelity guarantee, personal accident,
workmen's compensation and public liability.
Accounts and Auditing
3.10         UEB is audited by the Kampala office of the iaternational
auditing firm of Coopers and Lybrand.  The most recent report which has
been issued by the auditors is for the year ended December 31, 1982. The
auditors expect the audit report for the year 1983 to be available in early
1985.
3.11      The reasons for the delay in receiving the audit report on UEB's
accounts are that Coopers and Lybrand have a backlog of work stemming from
the unsettled conditions folloving the war and UEB's inability to provide
supporting data to the auditors on a timely basis.   Currently, UEB's
general accounting system appears to be functioning reasonably and is able
to produce accurate normal accounting reports in a timely manner. Both the
auditors and UEB believe that the difficulties are now past and in the
future their cooperative efforts will produce audited financial statements
on a more reasonable schedule. During negotiations agreement was obtained
that UEB will submit its accounts to IDA, certified by an independent
auditor acceptable to IDA, within six months following the end of the year.
3.12       The monitoring requirements of the proposed credit will put an
additional burden on the accounting system of UEB - that of producing the
data needed to measure UEB's performance in accordance with dollar
equivalent goals (para. 5.08). A small amount of funds adequate to finance
consulting services for the development of the required acounting
procedures will be available in the proposed credit if UEB desires to avail
itself of this assistance.
Billing and Collection
3.13      UEB has experienced considerable difficulties in customer billing
and account collection due, in some degree, to security problems, lack of
transport and periodic computer failure.   Recent data show that UEB is
collecting only 80% of the revenues billed.   As of December 31,  1983
Customer Accounts Receivable amounted to 43% of 1983 revenues or over five
months of the current year's billings.
3.14          Due primarily  to computer breakdowns,  billings have not
consistently been carried out on a timely basis.  Errors in the billing
records due to failure to receive change in service data when customers
moved have resulted in bills being incorrectly addressed and subsequently
returned unpaid.   Inefficiencies of the Ugandan postal system added to
these difficulties.   UEB maintains a 'f lying squad" which hand delivers
bills which have been returned by the Post Office, but lack of transport
has restricted its activities.



- 21 -
3.15        UEB's customers have difficulty coming to UEB offices to pay
their bills since public transport is limited.  UEB has been sending its
staff to the customers' residences to collect, but these collection
activities are also restricted by lack of transport.  This practice also
makes collectors very vulnerable to robbery. There have been several cases
in which UEB representatives have been physically assaulted while on bill
delivery or collection efforts.
3.16       Many government ministries, departments and parastatals do not
pay the bills for power used promptly and a few never pay.   UEB spends
considerable high-level management time discussing arrears with government
agencies, but has had limited success in obtaining payments.
3.17          Another problem is illegal connections, which occur when
customers who are unable to obtain service due to UEB's lack of required
connection materials, connect themselves to the network using various
devices.  Customers which have been disconnected due to non-payment also
reconnect  themselves.   UEB fines offenders USh 3,000 (US$5.7) plus a
USh 300 fee for reconnection.   Persistent offenders have their service
disconnected at the pole and are charged a minimum of USh 6,000 (US$11.5)
for reconnection.    Again,  lack  of  vehicles  and  security hinder  the
effectiveness of these efforts.
3.18      The project includes several components which should improve this
situation.  A new computer will make billings more timely and accurate.
The additional transport will  improve the effectiveness of  the meter
reading, bill delivery and collection efforts. Availability of connection
materials will improve UEB's responsiveness to customer demand and decrease
illegal connections.
3.19      However, a complete in-depth study of the billing and collection
problem is necessary before the new computer billing system is
implemented. The project includes funds for consulting services for this
study which should include, in addition to a review of the billing system,
a complete review of the data base (para. 2.09) including field checks
where necessary. The timing of the effort should be:
Appointment of Consultants                      September 30, 1985
Completion of Study                             March 31, 1986
Begin the Implementation of Recommendations    September 30, 1986
During negotiations agreement was obtained to conduct this study according
to terms of reference acceptable to Association in adherence with the above
timetable and that the agreed recommendations will be implemented in
accordance with a program agreed with the Association.
3.20          The problem of collection from Government ministries and
departments accounts should be resolved by authorizing UEB to receive
payment directly from the budget for all delinquent accounts. Government
will authorize UEB to apply appropriate measures to parastatals for failure
to pay their bills in a timely manner. The initiation of this program was
agreed with the Government during negotiations.



- 22 -
3.21       Collection goals should be established for UEB, and reporting of
the status of their efforts should be required semi-annually. The goals
should be established as follows:
Customer Accounts
Receivable as a Z
of Annual Revenues
December 31, 1985                            30
December 31, 1986                            25
December 31, 1987                            20
December 31, 1988 & subsequently             17
The semi-annual report should include an aged schedule of arrears by major
customer category, i.e. government, domestic, industry as of June 30 and
December 31, and the actual percentage relationship of accounts receivable
to the last twelve months' revenues at the reporting date.  These goals
were agreed during negotiations.
Stores and Workshop Procedures
3.22      UEB's warehouses and workshops are in very poor condition due to
past lack of materials and effective transport. With the initiation of the
proposed project, significant quantities of materials, spare parts and
transport vehicles will have to be handled ia these facilities.   The
existing practices and these facilities will not be adequate to handle this
expected volume of operations.   It was agreed that ODA would finance a
short study to determine what could be done as soon as possible; in any
event the study should be completed before project materials and spare
parts begin to be delivered in early 1986. ODA believes this study could
be conducted in 1985 and the recommendations could be available in early
1986. Therefore, during negotiations agreement was obtained that UEB will
implement the recommendations of the study by March 31, 1986.

IV. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives and Bank's Role
4.01        The primary objective of the proposed Power II project is to
prevent the development of a bottleneck in power supplies that would hinder
economic recovery in the medium term.   This objective would be achieved
through uprating and rehabilitation of existing generation capacity at the
Owen Falls power station aud the capacity of the existing transmission and
distribution system.   The proposed project also has the objective of
strengthening UEB's operational capability.   Assistance would be given
under the proposed project for studying UEB's electricity tariff levels and
structure, planning and project implementation capability and training
needs.   The project also contributes to future development of the power
system through inclusion of funds for carrying out a detailed feasibility
study for the next hydroelectric project to be built in Uganda
(para. 2.27).
4.02      The proposed project would be one of the first Bank operations in
the energy sector since the resumption of the Bank's activities in
Uganda.   This operation would establish the Bank's position as a major
participant in the dialogue on Uganda energy sector development.   The
Bank's involvement in this project has enabled a firm financing plan to be
arranged by encouraging other donor agencies to contribute expeditiously
substantial  foreign exchange resources.    The Bank will also use  its
i-avolvement in the project to provide technical assistance in line with the
Bank's power sector strategy (para. 2.17). The Bank will assist UEB in
ensuring that the project is implemented efficiently through adoption of
optimal procedures for procurement and management of physical resources
(para. 4.14). The Bank will also assist Government and UEB to strengthen
UEB's financial situation through implementation of sound policies on
tariffs and investment planning.
Condition of the Power System
4.03        The Uganda power system is in poor operational condition as
described in paras. 2.05-2.08. Regular maintenance has been neglected in
the past due to lack of transportation and foreign currency for the
purchase of spare parts. In July 1984 four of the ten units at Owen Falls
were  out  of  service.    All  units  must  be  thoroughly  tested  and
reconditioned. The gates, gantries, and intake screens are also in need of
repair. A spare generator transformer is required for the main substation.
4.04      The transmission and distribution networks are also in very poor
condition.   Limited clearance of brush along the transmission lines has
been undertaken during the past five years. At least half of the installed
wooden poles need to be replaced.  The distribution networks need to be
updated and overhauled, and several distribution transformers should be
relocated. There is a shortage of fuse switches and transformers on the
system.
4.05    Cracks in the dam and power house structure at Owen Falls have been
visible since 1964. A wide crack extends through the generator floor slab
and smaller cracks are visible in the spiral casing and the intake dam.



- 24 -
The downstream wall of the power house has moved slightly downstream. The
explanation favored by UEB's consulting civil engineers is that from 1961
to 1964 when the level of Lake Victoria rose above the top water levels
adopted for the design of the facility, unprecedented high discharges were
required and high downstream water levels were created.  This phenomenon
produced increased uplift on the power station foundations and within the
horizontal construction joints in the power station concrete, which caused
a reduction in pressure between the power station and its foundations.
Under horizontal pressure from the headwaters, movement occurred along the
construction joints which resulted in elongation of the spiral casing.
This explanation appears to account satisfactorily for most of the main
cracks. Other cracks such as the horizontal cracks and the vertical cracks
in the generation floor and the movement in the downstream wall could have
been caused by concrete growth from alkali/aggregate reaction. No single
hypothesis appears to explain all the cracks.
4.06      Regardless of the causes of the cracks and movement, the only
remedial action that will prevent further deterioration is the installation
of pre-stressed tendons around each of the spiral casings.   The exact
nnmber of tendons required will not be known until the results of the test
borings are available at the outset of the repair program. The contract
documents for this work will be written with sufficient flexibility to
allow for necesssary changes in the scope of the work to accommodate the
findings of the tests.
Project Description
4.07      A brief description of the components of the proposed project is
given below with details in Annex 7.
Owen Falls Power Station
- structural repairs to the dam and power house;
- rehabilitation of the ten turbo-generator units;
- rehabilitation of electrical and mechanical equipment such as
main cables, switchgear and control equipment, auxiliaries,
intake and draft tube equipment, and service gates; and
- workshop refurbishment and provision of tools and equipment for
maintenance.
Transmission and Distribution
- reconductoring and cable repairs, replacing wooden poles and
brush clearance for overhead lines;
- rehabilitation of underground networks;
- rehabilitation of substations;
- uprating of the existing 66 kV transmission line between Kampala
and Owen Falls to 132 kV; and



- 25 -
- workshops refurbishing and supplying tools and equipment for
maintenance and repairs.
General
- provision of vehicles for maintenance and repair services;
- refurbishment and rehabilitation of electrical and mechanical
workshops;
- provision of a computer;
- rehabilitation of UEB's training center;
- rehabilitation of UEB's staff housing;
- engineering   and   consulting  services   for  supervision   of
construction; and
- consultancy for carrying out studies of (i) UEB's tariff
structure and levels (para. 4.01), (ii) training needs (para.
3.08), (iii) the billing and collection system (para.3.19), and
(iv) engineering work for the next hydroelectric project(para.
2.27).
Technical Assistance for Ministry of Power, Posts and
Telecommunications
- technical assistance, focusing primarily on the formation and
operation  of  the  Energy  Deparetment  (para.  1.19).         The
establishment of the Energy Department was a recommendation of
the energy assessment report;
- technical assistance for carrying out a forest and plantation
inventory in Uganda (para. 1.05); and
- technical assistance for a fuelvood marketing survey as well as
an urban household energy survey in the major towns of Uganda
(para. 1.06).
Environmental Considerations
4.08      The services and works proposed under the proposed credit include
mainly repair and replacement of equipment in the existing Owen Falls power
station which relies on Lake Victoria as its reservoir and in the transmis-
sion and distribution systems. Most of the civil construction work on the
power plant would be performed indoors. Minor civil works would be done on
substations and operational buildings.   The environment would therefore
remain unaffected by the rehabilitation. In respect of water rights on the
River Nile, the Ugandan Government will notify the governments of other
riparian states that no modification is expecred to the river flow as a
result of the rehabilitation works.

Cost Estimates
4.09    The project cost is estimated to total US$58.4 million of which 84Z (US$49.3
million equivalent)  is  the foreign  exchange  component.    The  total  financing
requirements, including financed interest, is estimated to be US$73.4 million
equivalent. The local costs of US$21.0 million equivalent include a component for
duties and taxes primarily applied to vehicles, tools and workshop equipment, and to
interest financed.
4.10     The detailed cost estimate for the project is given in Annex 8 and is
summarized as follows:

The project cost estimate is based on current quotations from various
equipment manufacturers and contractors in Europe.   The base costs are
expressed in January 1985 price terms. UEB is exempt from taxes and duties
on power system equipment only; taxes and duties are applied for vehicles,
tools and workshop equipment. Physical contingencies for different project
components range from 10  to 15% on the base cost.   Adequate physical
contingencies were assumed for post tensioning in Owen Falls Power
Station.  The number of tendons suggested by consultants may have to be
increased as further site investigations during the first stage of the
works are completed. Price contingencies for foreign and local costs have
been calculated using the following annual escalation rates (international
inflation): 1985 - 8.0%; 1986 to 1988 - 9.0%; 1989 - 7.5%.
Financing Plan
4.11      The local costs of the project (US$21.0 million equivalent) would
be funded by UEB (US$19.6 million including US$11.8 of interest during
construction related to the onlending of the IDA Credit and the ODA Grant)
using resources generated from its operations (para. 5.17), by IDA
(component of US$1.2 million equivalent for technical assistance), and by
ODA (US$ 0.2 million).   UEB's requirement will affect the tariff level
required throughout the implementation period. For the total foreign cost
component, estimated at US$52.4 million equivalent, IDA would make
available US$28.8 million equivalent, CDC US$13.0 million equivalent and
ODA  US$12.0  million  equivalent.    The  prospective  financing  plan  is
therefore as follows:

Engineering Services
4.12      Despite the difficulties of the past decade with big constraints
mainly in obtaining spares, tools and vehicles, UEB has been relatively
effective in providing power to the country. However, UEB has not recently
undertaken any major construction since building the Owen Falls Power
Station. Therefore it is proposed that the project include engineering and
consulting services for design and equipment specification works as well as
for construction supervision for both the power plant and the transmission
and distribution systems. These services have been estimated at US$8,500
per manmonth, 232 manmonths for Owen Falls and 265 manmonths for
transmission and distribution. Agreement was obtained during negotiations
that UEB will appoint consulting engineers acceptable to the Association
for project engineering and supervision services.  It is likely that UEB
would continue to use the services of the consultants who prepared the
feasibility study for the proposed rehabilitation project and are producing
the long-term power development study (para. 2.27).



- 28 -
Project Implementation
4.13      UEB has enough skilled staff to undertake the major tasks of this
project; however, they would require contractors for civil works on the dam
and power house at Owen Falls, and for the uprating of the 66 kV line
between Kampala and Jinja and the strengthening of the lines between
Kampala and Nkenda and between Tororo and Lira.   UEB would provide the
labor for rehabilitation of the electrical and mechanical equipment at Owen
Falls under the supervision of the equipment and material suppliers as well
as the consulting engineers.   The transmission and distribution system
rehabilitation works would be undertaken by UEB personnel under the
supervision  of  consulting  engineers.    The  consultants  would  provide
technical assistance in planning, procurement, design and construction
standards,  project  implementation  and  control.    The  proposed  project
includes funds  for implementation   of the findings of the stores and
workshop study (para. 3.22).   It is also important that UEB be supplied
with sufficient transport and tools before starting the works.   Vehicles
financed from the IDA Second Reconstruction Credit (Credit 1252-UG of June
14, 1982) are in transit from Mombasa (Kenya) and should be available well
in advance of project implementation.   Additional vehicles and tools are
included in the project.   The successful equipment bidder for the main
equipment would provide erection supervision; the successful bidder on
communication equipment would provide the necessary training. Therefore,
with reliable workshops, stores, vehicles, tools and assistance from a
consulting  engineer,   UEB  would  be  capable  of  carrying  out  the
rehabilitation works. The project would require five years to be completed
because the rehabilitation of the ten generating units at Owen Falls has to
be carried out one at a time in order to minimize the risks of power
shortages by reducing the in-service generation capacity, and because space
constraints inside the power house limit the working space available for
rewinding the generators. The Project Implementation Schedule is shown in
Annex 9.
4.14       However, it is necessary for UEB to strengthen the managerial
structure of the technicql sectors involved. In the past there was a chief
electrical engineer supervising all technical services in UEB. Also there
were four area engineers for coordinating UEB district services. Once the
design is done and material and equipment received, the success of
transmission and distribution rehabilitation works will depend mainly on
the coordination and supervision of the job. A general coordinator would
be assigned by UEB to supervise the total project, including Owen Falls
power station works, transmission and distribution rehabilitation, training
center  construction  and  the  various  studies.    During  negotiations,
agreement was reached that UEB would establish the post or posts of Project
Coordinator and fill these posts with persons acceptable to the Association
by June 30, 1985.   UEB would also fill the posts of the four regional
engineers/managers by December 31, 1985.
Procurement
4.15       Since UEB has not undertaken a major project for many years, it
will need to coordinate closely with the consulting engineers in the
procurement process. All procurement would be evaluated by the consulting
engineers prior to submission to the Central Tender Board of the Ugandan



- 29 -
Government for final approval. During negotiations agreement was obtained
that UEB would be responsible for bid evaluation and contract award in
consultation with the consulting engineers.   All major components of the
project which would be financed from the proceeds of the IDA credit would
be procured in accordance with the Bank Guidelines for Procurement under
World Bank Loans and IDA Credits.  These components are mainly the civil
works at the dam and powerhouse of Owen Falls, electrical components of the
project  such  as  generator   transformers,   cables,   transmission  and
distribution transformers, control and protection equipment, communication
equipment and transmission and distribution hardware.   The minor civil
works on transmission installation would be performed by UEB staff.
However, the civil works for the training center and the local offices
reconstruction (at Masaka and at Kbarara) would be carried out by local
contractors and thus local competitive bidding should be used.   Only the
consulting engineering services and rehabilitation of the generating units,
funded by ODA (para. 4.11),  would have negotiated contracts.   As  the
generators were supplied by British firms, it is advisable that they carry
out the rehabilitation services. ODA is financing this part of the project
and would negotiate the contract with the suppliers. It is considered that
negotiated contracts with the suppliers of the turbo-generator units would
achieve the best contract conditions for UEB in terms of price, equipment
performance and contract program. The CDC funds would be made available to
UEB in cofinancing arrangements with the IDA. Thus all CDC-financed items
would be procured in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines.

Disbursement
4.16      The IDA credit would be disbursed over a period of four years and
used for:
(i) the Owen Falls Power Station: 69.5% (US$5.4 million) of foreign
cost for civil works at the dam and power house, gates and
associated equipment, main cables, transformers, and workshops;
(ii) the  transmission  and  distribution  system:    69.5%  (US$15.9
million) of foreign cost for the uprating of the Kampala-Owen
Falls transmission line, strengthening of the Kampala-Nkenda and
Tororo-Lira    transmission    lines,    substation    equipment,
distribution transformers, transmission and distribution cables
and hardware, transmission steel towers, civil works at
operational  buildings  and  staff  housing,  tools  and  test
equipment, pole treatment plant, communication and control
equipment, engineering and supervision for transmission and
distribution works; 95% (US$1.6 million) of local costs for the
uprating of the Kampala-Owen Falls transmission line and the
strengthening of the Kampala-Nkenda and Tororo-Lira transmission
lines;
Ciii) 69.5% (US$4.5 million) of foreign costs for vehicles, a computer,
training facilities, and technical assistance.
(iv) 95% (US$1.4 million) of local costs for technical assistance.
ODA funds would be used to finance the total foreign cost for the
turbo-generator work and the associated engineering and supervision.   CDC
funds would be used for financing 30.5% of foreigr. costs of all items
financed by IDA plus the total foreign cost of interest during construction
on the CDC loan.   The foreign cost of the technical assistance for the
studies is estimated to average US$13,000 per manmonth.
4.17      The disbursement schedule for the IDA Credit summarized in Annex
10 would be at a quicker rate than the standard profile for power projects
in the Eastern Africa Region because most equipment would be procured
within the first few years in order to be available for the transmission
and distribution rehabilitation works.  The project does not include the
usual  construction  of  new  facilities,  and  all  foreign  currrency
expenditures are for the purchase of equipment and erection materials.
Project Monitoring and Evaluation
4.18        The records and reports necessary to monitor progress of the
project and its evaluation were agreed upon during negotiations.   The
proposed detailed guidelines for a project monitoring system are given in
Annex 11.  Preparation of a project completion report not later than six
months after project completion was agreed during negotiations.  Some key
performance indicators for UEB during the project implementation period

V.   FINANCIAL ASPECTS AND COST RECOVERY
Past Financial Performance
5.01         In accordance with the Electricity Act of 1964, the tariffs
charged for electricity service supplied bv UEB should be adequate to cover
operating costs (excluding depreciation), debt service and normal capital
expenditures.  This requirement was satisfied through 1973, when UEB was
earning a rate of return on fixed assets (historical cost) of around 12%.
However, since this period UEB's financial performance has deteriorated due
to only marginal tariff adjustments, difficulties with billings and
collections and declining demand.   In 1978 and 1979, UEB operated at a
loss. Beginning in 1980 the situation improved due to a series of tariff
adjustments and additional revenues from sales to Kenya. Even so, UEB has
had difficulty in providing sufficient funds to meet the costs of imported
spares and materials for routine maintenance and has been unable to
generate any significant contributioa towards capital development.
5.02        The results of operations of UE3 from 1982 through 1984 are
summarized below:

5.03       The significant improvement in cash gene:ation in 1984 resulted
from  the  tariff  measures  implemented  August  1   1984  which  included
conversion to a flat rate tariff structure and an increase in rates which
raised the average tariff yield by about 430% and more than compensated for
the nearly 500% wage and salary increases granted July 1, 1984.   Details
are shown in Annexes 12 and 13.  Debt service coverage was acceptable at
2.4 times.

5.05        The working capital position as of December 31, 1983 and 1984
appears to be acceptable with a current ratio of at least 2.1.  However,
current assets include customer accounts receivable balances which reflect
about five months of sales, and the 1983 ratio reflects a bank overdraft of
USh 84.5 million. Therefore UEB's current position was very weak but will
improve as a result of the tariff increase effected on August 1, 1984.
5.06        UEB's debt-equity ratio based on figures appearing in UEB's
accounts as of December 31, 1983 and 1984 is misleading and shows a
substantial debt position of 41% and 39%, respectively. However, if assets
are revalued and revaluation surplus is reflected in equity, the ratio
changes to 3197, which more correctly reflects UEB's current position with
its insignificant amount of debt.
Retail Tariffs
5.07       In 1961 UEB established the retail tariff structure, which was
based on a declining charge for successive blocks of energy consumption in
a billing period.   Such a structure was promotional and reflected the
considerable surplus in generation capacity over demand that existed



- 34 -
shortly after eight of the ten generating units at Owen Falls Power Station
had been installed. The tariff level remained unchanged until 1979 despite
considerable inflation during the intervening period.  This was largely
made possible by the absence of any major capital expenditure program.
However, by 1979 UEB was faced with rapidly increasing costs due to
inflation and the need to import substantial quantities of materials,
spares and equipment to repair the transmission and distribution system
which had been poorly maintained for years and had been damaged during
1979.  UEB embarked on a series of 50% increases in July 1580, J.anuary
1982, July 1982 and March 1984.  Despite this program, UEB's financial
performance continued to deteriorate (para. 5.01).  Effective August 1,
1984, UEB revised its tariff structure, abolishing the declining block
tariff and establishing a flat rate averaging Ush7.0/kWh. This revision
resulted in an annual revenue increase of about 430%.
5.08       Inflation in Uganda which apoeared to be diminishing and coming
under control in recent years after a long period of high double digit
magnitude, again soared after the implementation of the over-all wage and
salary increase in July 1984 (para 5.03). It is now anticipated that by
the end of 1984 the inflation rate will be about 60% on an annualized basis
and that the level of inflation in the innediate future will be difficult
to predict.   Therefore, for the purposes of this report, it has been
necessary to project future operating results and financial positions of
liEB in US$ terms (Annexes 15, 16, and 17). Thus the financial performance
shown in these projections reflect only the anticipated international
inflation in United States currency, and tariff increases shown in these
projections must be augmented by increases relative to the movement of the
USh against the US$ to derive the corresponding tariff rate in Ugandan
currency terms, assuming that exchange fluctuations will be consistent with
local inflation. Additional corrections will have to be made where there
is a lack of consistency. If inflation remains near the 1984 level during
the project implementation period, significant tariff increases will be
required  to compensate for the related movement in the exchange rate.
Since the financial projections are expressed in US$, these tariff increase
requirements are not evident. However, the requirements detailed in para.
5.09 will provide UEB with the mechanism to adjust its revenue as necessary
and will provide IDA with the data to monitor UEB's performance.
5.09       Based on these US$ projections, UEB would have positive earnings
throughout the 1985-1991 period with rates of return based on a revalued
asset-base of 1% in 1985, 5% in 1986, 6% in 1987, 7Z in 1988 and 1989 and
8% thereafter.  This performance anticipates tariff increases in US$ terms
of 50% in 1986, 24% 4n 1987, 112 in 1989 and 16% in 1990.  The tariff
increase percentages for 1986 and 1987 apply to Ugandan sales; the increase
percentages for 1989 and 1990 apply to all sales including the bulk sales
to Kenya and Tanzania. Revenues in 1991 based on this tariff program would
be USt3.37/kWh for Ugandan services and USt2.77/kWh overall compared with
the preliminary estimate for LRIC of about USt5/kWh (para. 6.12).
Additional increases throughout the period would be required if the rate of
inflation in Uganda exceeds the international rate (which is very likely to
occur in the inmnediate future based on recent performance) or the exchange
rate between the USh and the US$ varies from that at December 31, 1984
(US$1 USh 520). During negotiations, agreement was reached that IJEB will
earn these annual rates-of-return on average net revalued plant in



- 35 -
operation and that these measures of performance will be based on the US$
equivalent of UEB's operating performance and financial position.   It
was also agreed that UEB will review the adequacy of its tariffs to meet
these earnings requirements at least quarterly and revise the tariffs
expeditiously as required.
5.10         The performance measures detailed in para 5.09 will require
special financial reporting quarterly and annually showing UEB's operations
in U.S. dollar equivalents and reflecting the revaluation of UEB's fixed
assets (para 5.20).   It was agreed that UEB will submit a report on its
quarterly review and related tariff action within one month of the close of
the calender quarter.
5.11       The financial projections exclude the requirements for a second
hydroelectric generating station since the decision on the size and plans
for its financing have not been taken. It would appear that construction
of this facility should begin about 1987 if it is to be completed by 1991
when present demand forecasts show a need for additional generating
capacity. Higher revenues and rates of return than those reflected in the
projections will probably be required to provide at least the local fund
compenent for the financing of the facility.   This situation will be
initially monitored through the application of the debt service covenant.
Therefore, during negotiations agreement was obtained that UEB would not
incuir any new debt without IDA's agreement unless historical twelve month
net revenues of UEB cover future maximum debt service, including that
related to the new debt, at least 1.5 times.
Tariff - Bulk Supply to Kenya and Tanzania
5.12      The agreement to provide a bulk power supply to Kenya was signed
on June 15, 1955.  This agreement was for a term of 50 years and had no
explicit provision for renegotiation of rates or volume of supply during
the term of the contract. However, in 1980 this contract was voluntarily
renegotiated.   Under the terms of the renegotiation, Kenya was to pay
KSh 0.075/kWh for supplies up to 30 MW at 90% load factor and KSh 0.135/kWh
for additional units (USt 0.25 per kWh compared to the Ugandan consumption
average of USt 0.75/kWh in 1984). The agreement also contains a capacity
charge of KSh 30.25/kW per annum with a minimum payment for 30 MW. In the
past, when Uganda had substantial surplus capacity, sales to Kenya at even
lower rates than the present levels were justified as extra income for
power supplied at zero marginal cost, and these sales were an important
source of income to UEB and foreign exchange to Uganda. However, when the
demand on the Ugandan system surpasses existing generating capacity, which
is projected to occur about 1991 if this proposed rehabilitation project is
implemented, power supplies to Kenya will have an opportunity cost for
Uganda equal to the long-run marginal cost of installing new capacity,
estimated at about US$.05/kWh in 1984 prices.



- 36 -
5.13      UEB has been discussing the level of the Kenya bulk supply tariff
with KP&L and anticipates anotber increase in the near future, since even
if the tariff was increased to reflect the cost of installing new capacity,
Ugandan power would remain a low-cost source of supply to Kenya, and Kenya
has unofficially indicated its willingness to review the situation .
Uganda should persuade Kenya to agree to an increase since additional funds
are required to maintain the existing generating facility and prevent the
loss of this supply to Kenya.   Formal discussions are scheduled to be
initiated when the supporting data is available from the Power Development
Study (para. 2.27).
5.14       In 1983 the Government agreed to export 16 KW (126 GWh/year) to
Tanzania along the west side of Lake Victoria as far as Bukoba, and UEB has
agreed to construct the transmission line to connect with the Tanzanian
transmission facilities to provide this service.   This construction is
unlikely to be completed before sometime in 1987 and revenue `rom this
source has been reflected in the financial projections beginning in 1988.
For projection purposes the revenues from this service and from that
provided to Kenya have been estimated from 1988 reflecting a rate which
approximates 50% of the average retail rate for service to Ugandan
consumers. The magnitude of the rate charged for this bulk service would
naturally affect the magnitude of the rate required to be charged for
retail  service  in Uganda  to maintain UEB's  financial  viability.    An
additional increase in the Ugandan tariffs of 25% would be required in 1988
to compensate for the additional revenue projected from Kenyan sales if the
520% increase reflected in the export tariff cannot be negotiated.
Therefore, the timing and amount of bulk tariff increases which can be
obtained will influence what increases might be required to comply with the
earnings requirements detailed in para. 5.09.
Proposed Financing Plan
5.15       A detailed funds flow statement for UEB is showa in Annex 17.  A
summary of UEB's projected financing plan for 1990 through 1990 is given on
the following page.
5.16         During the project implemeatation period (1985-1990), UEB's
construction program anticipates expenditure of US$97.6 million including
interest financed of US$14.9 million. About 71% or US$69.4 million of the
total construction program during this period relates to the proposed
project. Based on the financing plan detailed in para. 5.15 and assuming
tariff increases detailed in paras. 5.09 and 5.14, this program would be
feasible.
5.17        internal generation would cover the direct local cost of the
project construction, the interest requirement on the project debt after
the  interest  financing  periods  have  expired,   the  debt  repayment
requirements on the project debt after the grace periods have expired
(paras. 5,A18 and 5.19), and the debt servicing requirements on all other
debt. Internal generation after covering debt services produces 39% of the
funds required for construction during the project implementation period,
which is reasonable.

Financing Terms
5.18        CDC would provide about US$13 million for a term of 20 years
including a grace period on principal repayment of 5 years.   CDC would
finance the interest requirement during the five year grace period adding
this requirement to the principal amount of the loan. UEB would bear the
exchange risk.
5.19      ODA funds and US$24.8 million of IDA funds would be onlent to UEB
for a term of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years at an interest
rate of 10%. The Government would finance the interest requirement during
the five years of the project implementation, and UEB would bear the
exchange  risk.    The  onlending  rate  and  terms  were  agreed  during
negotiations.
Revaluation of Assets
5.20       UEB has not revalued its assets since 1971 and consequently has
asset values in its accounts which are significantly below replacement
costs.   Thus the rehabilitation of the plant proposed in the project is
estimated to cost over 15 times the total book value of the plant. This
undervaluation is evident in the level of the charge for annual
depreciation which is computed on historical costs. During the year 1983
the depreciation charged was only about 8% of the total operating expenses,
which is extremely low for a hydroelectric system where the largest single
expense is normally depreciation.  The undervaluation of fixed assets is
also evident in the debt-equity ratio (para. 5.06).
5.21        The appraisal mission revalued the plant in service and the
accumulated depreciation using an index which was composed of a combination
of the consumer price indexes for Uganda and the UK and weighted 60-40,
Uganda-UK, to reflect the composition by origin of the plant.  The rate of
return computations (para. 5.09) and the proposed earning requirements
which UEB would be expected to attain are based on the revalued asset base
arrived at by using this index. UEB agrees to using a revalued asset base
for earning requirement purposes but opposes reflecting this base in its
accounts.   During negotiations the application of the above revaluation
formula was agreed for application in computation of the Rate of Return
requirement (para. 5.09). This asset valuation will be used in the special
financial reporting referred to in para 5.10.
Future Operations and Financial Performance
5.22      The projected results of operations for UEB in US$ equivalent for
the 1984-1991 period are shown in Annex 15. The projections indicate that
UEB's financial performance and condition would be satisfactory throughout
the period. This performance is based on the estimated average annual rate
of increase in sales of about 7%, tariff increases of 50% (1986), 24%
(1987), 11% (1989) and 16% (1990) in addition to that made effective August
1, 1984 (para. 5.03) and the revision of the bulk tariff in 1988
(para. 5.14). Assumptions used in the financial projections are detailed
in Annex 18. Key financial indicators for measuring UEB's performance are

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
Project Need
6.01    The need for the proposed power system rehabilitation project rests
largely on the judgement of experts that rajor components of the system are
in a condition that could result in a major reduction of system capability
in the next few years (para. 4.03). Such an occurrence would be disastrous
for the Ugandan economy, and therefore the proposed project is vital to the
recovery of the economy.   The project would also provide an increase of
about 20% in generation capacity from 150 to 180 MW through uprating the
Owen Falls power station, although this would not increase the firm energy
capability of the station.  This capacity could supply fully the forecast
demand for power ap to about 1991, which is the earliest possible year for
commissioning  new  hydroelectric  generation  facilities.    Without  the
proposed uprating, the rehabilitated capacity of the station would be able
to supply fully the forecast demand for power to about 1988, and thus the
proposed uprating would bridge the forecast gap between demand and supply
until new generating capacity is commissioned. 7/  The proposed project
includes provision for uprating the existing 66 kV transmission line
between Jinja and Kampala to 132 kV to meet increases in demand from 1988
onwards (para. 2.25), and for the st:engthening of the existing 132 kV
transmission lines from Kampala to Nkenda (near Kasese) and from Tororo to
Lira (para. 2.07). The proposed project also includes components required
in preparation for a new hydroelectric station (engineering work for the
selected site and manpower training) and to improve UEB's efficiency in
collecting revenues.
6.02     The balance between generation capacity and system demand during
the next few years will eepend on the program for rehabilitation of the
turbo-generator units relative to growth in demand on the UEB system and to
the rate at which units cease operation due to major breakdown before
rehabilitation. The monthly balances to end 1991 have been projected based
on t1e demand forecast (para. 2.24), the scheduled rehabilitation program
(para. 4.13) and estimates provided by UEB's consulting engineers of the
rate of outages of units in the absence of rehabilitation. These estimates
are based largely on judgement and should not be considered as firm
predictions; they have been provided only for purposes of project
justification.
6.03     The projections show that the balance is most sensitive to the
coincidence of Kenyan demand on the UEB system ar the time of peak Ugandan
demand.   Two limiting cases for the coincidence of Kenyan demand are
relevant for projecting the balance of supply and demand during and
immediately following the proposed rehabilitation program.  In both cases
it is assumed that Kenya would continue to draw its energy entitlement from
the Ugandan system (252 GWh/year).   In one case, it is assumed that the
Kenyan system attempts to draw the contracted -minimum supply of 30 MW at
the time of the peak Ugandan demand.  This is the most severe condition and
it would force UEB to shed intermittently up to 20 MW of load in 1986, 1987
and 1988 out of a forecast total peak demand that rises from 133 MW in 1986
to  148 MW  in  1988 under  the proposed rehabilitation  schedule.   The
7/ There would be minor load shedding from 1986 to 1988 during the
scheduled rehabilitation program while generating units are taken out
of service.



- 41 -
associated unserved energy demand would not be substantial, amounting to
less than one GWh per year which is equivalent to about 1.5% of total
demand, since this load shedding would take place only for short durations
during periods of daily peak demand. In the second case it is assumed that
the coincident Kenyan demand is restricted to taking up the available
capacity in the UEB system at the times of peak Ugandan demand.  This is
the least severe case acceptable for planning purposes, and it represents
the pattern that appears to have been occurring for the past few years
(para. 2.11). Under this scenario, there would be negligible load shedding
up  to  1991  with  the  rehabilitation  program  implemented  according  to
schedule.  Although this scenario would benefit Uganda, it could impose
costs on Kenya in the form of supply constraints.   The supply/demand
balances under various scenarios are summarized in Annex 19.
6.04      In the absence of rehabilitation, generating units at the Owen
Falls power station would progressively cease operating in a series of
breakdowns. The likelihood of breakdowns on operating units would increase
as more units break down due to the transfer of additional load onto the
units remaining in operation. The schedule of outages adopted for project
justification if units are not rehabilitated assumes that turbo-generating
unit number 3 would be the first unit to break down and would occur in
mid-1986.  Subsequently it is assumed that units would break down at the
rate of one every six months, and there would be no generating capacity
available from the beginning of 1990.   According  to the schedule  the
station would be able to supply the forecast demand apart from a low level
of unserved energy demand up to 1987, but the level of unserved demand
would rise to about 40% of total energy demand in 1988, 75% in 1989 and
100% thereafter. If Uganda ceased power exports to Kenya entirely in such
a situation, an event which would produce economic costs for Kenya, the
proportion of unserved Ugandan energy demand would be low (less than 10X)
in 1988, but would rise rapidly to about 65% in 1989 and 100% thereafter.
Least Cost Development Program
6.05         The  alternative  generation  sources  to  the  rehabilitated
hydroelectric station at Owen Falls are a new hydroelectric station
elsewhere on the Victoria Nile river (para. 1.07) and thermal capacity.
Preparation work for a new hydroelectric station has already been startel
(para. 2.27), but the earliest commissioning date would be 1991, which is
about two years after the Owen Falls station would cease to be an effective
source of power  in the absence of rehabilitation.   Therefore,  a new
hydroelectric station would not be a timely alternative to rehabilitation
of the Owen Falls power station, and interim sources of power based on new
thermal capacity would have to be installed to avoid major disruption to
the Ugandan economy before the commissiortng of new hydroelectric
capacity. Rehabilitation of the Owen Falls p:. 'er station provides a much
lower cost source of power than a new hydroelectric station, averaging
about US$100/kW installed 8; compared to a probable range of US$800 to
1,000/kW installed in 1985 price terms for a new station plus the cost of
interim thermal capacity. Rehabilitation would extend the working life of
8/ The average cost of about US$100/kW installed for rehabilitation of
Owen Falls station is derived from estimated base cost plus physical
contingencies   of  US$18  million  for  this  component   (including
engineering and supervision) to restore to service generating units
with a combined rated capacity of 180 KW.



- 42 -
the Oven Falls power station by about 30 years, provided that adequate
maintenance is carried out, which is equivalent to the life of a new
hydroelectric power station.
6.06       Thermal types of generation capacity are also much higher-cost
options than rehabilitation of the Owen Falls power station.   At the
margin, a gas turbine would be the lowest cost thermal alternative to
rehabilitation of one of the turbo-generating sets at Owen Falls, in which
case it would be used only during periods of peak load to minimize the high
fuel costs of operating gas turbines. However, the capital cost of a gas
turbine, at about US$500/kW installed, is many times the average capital
cost  of  rehabilitating  the  units  at  the  Owen  Falls  station.    The
lowest-cost alternative thermal plant for total replacement of the Owen
Falls station would be diesel generators with a capital cost of about
US$800/kW installed and a specific fuel cost of at least US$.05/kWh. The
cost of meeting demand by using this alternative is still many times
greater than by rehabilitating the Owen Falls station at an average capital
cost of US$100/kW and zero energy cost. In general, the cost of a thermal
plant is much higher than the cost of either rehabilitation of the Owen
Falls station or of a new hydroelectric station in Uganda.
6.07        The least cost power development program for Uganda is thus
clearly based on indigenous hydroelectric resources, with rehabilitation of
Owen Falls station as the first stage followed by a new hydroelectric
station in 1991.   The main issue for the rehabilitation project is the
optimal timing, although this does not affect the date when the new station
is required.   The economic benefit of rehabilitation is the incremental
demand for electrical energy that is served as a result of the project.
The economic cost of rehabilitation is the commitment of economic resources
to the project at a particular time expressed through the estimated
opportunity cost of capital of 12% per year.  Delaying the rehabilitation
project reduces the present value of both benefits and costs; the optimal
timing for the project is the program that gives the maximum net present
value for the investment in the project.  The criteria for comparison is
the cost of meeting incremental rnergy demand against the economic value of
power in Uganda. 9/ The evaluation would show that advancing the timing
of the rehabilitation project would be justified as long as this cost
remained below the economic value of power in Uganda.
6.08      The costs and benefits of carrying out the rehabilitation project
have been compared according to the scheduled program, which is the sconest
that can be achieved, with delays of one year and two years respectively to
the start of the program.  The cost of meeting incremental energy demand
(avoiding an energy shortage) that would be served by avoiding a one year
delay in starting the rehabilitation program is estimated (Annex 19) to
range between US cents 0.8/kWh generated and US cents 1.6/kWh generated at
January 1985 prices according to the degree of coincidence of exports
91 The cost of meeting incremental energy demand from the rehabilitation
project is defined as the ratio of the difference in present values of
served energy demand to the difference in present values of
rehabilitation costs between the scheduled and delayed programs. This
cost is expressed in terms of the U.S. currency instead of Ugandan
currency due to the uncertainties in predicting Ugandan inflation and
exchange rate movements (para. 5.08).

to Kenya with Ugandan peak demand. The cost of meeting incremental devmand
falls significantly to about US cents 0.4/kWh generated by avoiding a two
year delay in starting the rehabilitation program. These costs do not take
account of the possibility of increases in rehabilitation costs arising
from further deterioration with delay in rehabilitation.   The minimum
estimate of the economic value of power is the average electricity tariff
yield, which demonstrates a minimum amount that consumers are willing to
pay. The tariff in January, 1985 was the equivalent of US cents 1.4/kWh,
and the projected yield to meet UEB's financial objectives (para. 5.09) in
January 1985 price terms varies between 1.4 and 2.24 US cents/kWh sold
during the period 1985 to 1991, which is equivalent to between 1.2 and 1.95
US cents/kWh generated.   10/  The actual economic value of power to the
Ugandan economy is substantially higher, which the mission estimates to be
about US cents 8/kWh in January 19C5 prices in terms of consumer
willingness-to-pay (para. 6.12). Therefore the range of estimates for the
cost of meeting incremental demand is well below the economic value of
power and is generally below the tariff yield. The comparison shows that
carrying out the rehabilitation project as soon as possible, as proposed,
is economically justified.
6.09     The sensitivity of the mission's analysis of the cost of meeting
incremental energy demand is given in Annex 19 for a range of values for
the main parameters in the evaluation.  These ranges are (a) variation in
the coincidence of Kenyan demand at the time of Ugandan maximum demand
between full coincidence and variable coincidence according to UEB's
available capacity; (b) a range of levels of Lake Victoria 11/; and (c)
the growth rate of Ugandan demand (including new exports to Tanzania) in
the range of 80 to 120% of the forecast growth rate (para. 2.24).   The
sensitivity of the estimates of the cost of meeting incremental energy
demand to discount rate for the opportunity of capital is also tested at
rates of 8% and 16%.  The analysis shows that the coincidence factor of
Kenyan demand is the most sensitive variable, and that the level of Lake
Victoria is the least sensitive variable.   However, the cost of meeting
incremental energy demand is well below the economic value of power for all
sensitivity  cases  analyzed,  thus  confirming  the  justification  for
proceeding with the rehabilitation project as soon as possible according to
the scheduled program.
Internal Rate of Return
6.10      The internal rate of return (IRR) of UEB's present investment
program,  of  which  the  proposed  rehabilitation  project  is  the  major
component, is estimated to be 16.7% (Annex 20).  The IRR is derived from
comparison of the costs of the program with the benefits in terms of demand
that will be served from the rehabilitated facilities.  The estimated IRR
10/ Allowing for power system technical losses of 15%.
11/ The level of Lake Victoria determines the hydraulic head and hence the
output capability of the turbines at the Owen Falls power station. The
basic case for the economic evaluation assumes that the lake level will
be in accordance with the median forecast from the hydrological study
carried out as part of the Power Development Study (para. 2.27). The
sensitivity analysis examines the incremental cost of meeting energy
demand at high and low forecast lake levels which have probabilities of
90Z and 10% respectively of not being exceeded during the next 30
years.

does not include investments required to meet major increases in demand,
specifically a new power station.   Benefits are defined by incremental
energy demand served by reference to the case in which the rehabilitation
program is not undertaken (para. 6.04) valued at the prevailing tariff
level in January, 1985 (US cents 1.4/kWh), which is low by world standards
and in comparison to economic costs (para. 6.12).  At the higher average
tariff yield required to meet financial objectives (para. 5.09) (averaging
US cents 2.1/kWh in 1985 price terms), the IRR is estimated to be 21.6%,
which is well above the estimated value for the opportunity cost of capital
in Uganda (12%).
6.11     Both these estimates give financial rates of return adjusted for
price  inflation  and  excluding  duties  and  taxes.    These  rates  are
underestimates for the economic rate of return since they do not take
account of the substantial consumer surplus above these low tariff rates
that consumers derive from the use of electric power. Since the increment
of energy demand under consideration constitutes a large proportion of the
total demand in some years, the element of consumer surplus is a
substantial source of benefit for the project.
Tariffs, Long-run Marginal Costs and Consumers Willingness to Pay
6.12     A firm estimate of the long run marginal cost (LRMC) of meeting
increasing demand for power from the UEB system based on hydroelectric
generating capacity is not yet available. An estimate of the LRMC would be
derived in the tariff study included in the proposed project based on the
findings  of the Power Development Study (para. 2.27).   A preliminary
estimate for the LRMC of US cents 5/kWh was derived in the energy
assessment  report.    The present tariff yield of US cents  1.4/kWh in
January 1985 price terms is thus only about 30% of the estimated LRMC.
Once a firm estimate of LRMC has been derived, Government policy should be
to raise tariffs to be in accordance with LRMC before the next
hydroelectric station is commissioned to ensure that electricity consumers
pay the full economic cost of meeting their demand. Although such a policy
implies a multifold increase in the tariff level in constant price terms,
the mission considers that consumers willingness to pay for power
substantially  exceeds  even  the LRMC.   The mission has made  its own
order-of-magnitude estimate of consumers willingness to pay for the
forecast demand for power from the public system to be about US cents
9.6/kWh as an average for all consumer categories  (Annex 21).   This
estimate considerably exceeds the estimated LRMC of supply and illustrates
the scope Government has for tariff reform.
6.13           The proposed tariff  study  (para.  4.01) would also make
recommendations  on revisions  to  the tariff  structure.    UEB has  just
abolished a declining block rate structure for residential tariffs in favor
of a flat charge for energy for all consumer categories.   However, this
structure and levels do not take account of the costs of providing
additional generating capacity to meet peak demands.   The differences in
rates between consumer categories need to be reviewed to ensure that they
reflect correctly the differences in supply costs.   During negotiations
agreement was reached on the program for implementing the tariff study

based on terms of reference acceptable to the Association, and that this
study should be based on the conclusions of the Power Development Study
(para. 2.27) and the definition of the next major hydroelectric development
in Uganda.  The program should aim for implementation of the new tariff
structure and levels by January 1, 1987.
Project Risks
6.14      The major project risk is the ability of Ugandan Government to
maintain a secure environment.   There are many areas in the country in
which the rehabilitation work on the transmission and distribution systems
could be delayed and even suspended due to difficulties experienced by the
local authorities in maintaining publlic security.   Most problems have
occurred in the area located about ten to fifteen miles from Kampala. No
problems are anticipated at Owen Falls, the locale for most of the project
works.   Where necessary,  contracts will contain provisions  to protect
contractors against losses resulting from security factlities.

SECOND POWER PROJECT
Project Description
1.        The main project components are rehabilitation of the Owen Falls
power plant, transmission and distribution rehabilitation, and studies and
training.
Owen Falls Rehabilitation
2.         The Owen Falls rehabilitation component consists of civil works
to the dam and power house and rehabilitation of its main equipment, such
as generators and turbines, and related equipment.  The civil works will
include repairs to the dam to stop leakage and post tensioning to the
structure in order to close cracks. Minor works are required to the power
house roofing and ceiling.   The rehabilitation of the generators will
consist mainly of rewinding all units, overhaul of the electrical
components, and supply of new cabling and control equipment. The generator
transformers are in acceptable condition; two spare units will be supplied
as well as extensive maintenance services. The turbines are generally in
good condition but modification to the sealing is necessary as well as an
overall review and rehabilitation of its auxiliaries.  A general review of
all power station equipment will be undertaken with the objective of
rehabilitation to the original capacity.  It should be noted that due to
the modern design concepts for generators, the rehabilitation of the Owen
Falls units will provide an increase in rated capacity of 3 MW per unit,
resulting in a total new design rating of 18 MW per unit.
Transmission and Distribution
4.          Substation equipment.   The project will cover the supply of
traasmission transformers of 132 kV and 33 kV and control and switchgear
equipment.
5.          Transmission and distribution lines.  Conductors and hardware
will be covered by project cost estimates as well as the supply of wood
poles, transmission towers, distribution transformers and underground line
material. This item also includes supply of consumer connection materials.
6.          Kamala - Owen Falls transmission line.  Also included in the
project is uprating of the existing 66 kV transmission line between Kampala
and Owen Falls to 132 kV. The existing steel towers will be retained.
7.          Kampala - Nkenda and Tororo - Lira Transmission Lines.  These
existing 132 kV lines will be strengthened by the replacement of existing
wooden angled structures by steel structures, thus increasing security of
supply .

ANNEX 7
Page 2 of 3
8.         Communication and control.  New PLC (Power Line Carrier) SCADA,
telephone and radio components will be supplied. The main objective is to
provide UEB with operational and maintenance communication capability
between all interconnected system substations, the main district offices
and vehicles.
9.         Vehicles and tools.  The supply of a new fleet of 30 vehicles is
envisaged, as weLl as special vehicles such as forklift trucks aad cranes.
Tools and workshop equipment will be supplied for all UEB transmission and
distribution crewmembers as well as for the existing electrical,
mechanical, communication, metering and protection workshops in Kampala.
10.              Other  components  of  the  transmission  and  distribution
rehabilitation services will be civil works repair for all operational
buildings, the reconstruction of the district offices of Mbarara and
Masaka, and the supply of a new computer to UEB.
Training and Studies
11.        The project envisages the reconstruction of the Jinja Training
School and supply of educational equipment, with a target of regular
courses for training 300 technicians during the next five-year period as
well as intermittent refresher courses, management seminars, briefing for
new staff, job safety, meter readers, and installation inspectors.   An
overall  training  needs  study  is also included  in the project.    The
reconstruction of hostel facilities for the courses is also included in the
project.
12.       A tariff structure study, a billing and collection system study,
a training needs study, and a feasibility study for the next power plant
are included in the project.
13.        Technical assistance to the Ministry of Power, Posts and Tele-
communications. Funds are available in the project for specific technical
assistance to the Ministry for: (i) helping to organize the Energy
Department (ii) to carry out a forest and plantation inventory and (iii) to
conduct household energy and fuelwood marketing surveys.
14.        The UNDP/World Bank Energy Assessment Report on Uganda (Uganda:
Issues and Options in the Energy Sector, July 1983) recommended setting up
an Energy Department in MPPT.   The follow-up Energy Assessment Status
Report (August 1984) noted that further steps have been taken by Government
to provide sufficient staff positions and begin personnel recruitment to
allow a start to the Energy Department operations in mid-1984. Furthermore
Government has asked for technical assistance focusing primarily on the
formation and operation of the Energy Department.
15.         A forestry and plantation inventory of Uganda (districts and
total areas to be discussed with the Forestry Department) needs to be
carried out to determine species, volume per hectare, adequacy of

16.        As part of energy sector planning, surveys of fuelvood marketing
and distribution channels and of household energy consumption in the main
towns are required.   The survey on fuelwood should examine efficiency of
marketing and distribution channels, profit margins, and recommend possible
incentive to bring about improvements in marketing efficiency for the
supply of fuelwood to urban areas. The household energy survey in the main
towns should include studies on consumption of wood, charcoal, kerosene and
electricity and its relation to household size and income, expected future
trends, transport distance and supply regions.  It is envisaged that these
three surveys will form the basis for the preparation of an urban household
energy strategy by the Energy Department in KPPT.

UGANDA
SECOND POWER PROJECT
Notes and Assumptions for Financial Statements
Sales and Revenues
1.        Sales for each customer category are based in the demand forecast
and appear in Annex 15. Tariff measures which result in revenue increases
of 50%, 24%, 11%, and 16% are reflected in years 1986, 1987, 1989 and 1990,
respectively.   Bulk demand has been forecast as constant at 252 GWh for
Kenya and 30 to 45 GWh for Tanzania. Bulk tariffs reflect an increase to
50% of average retail tariffs in 1988 when service to Tanzania commences
and in 1989 and 1990 as an element of the overall tariff increase.
Expenses
2.             Fuel.   In accordance with UEB's estimates,  fuel expense
projections reflect a reduction of USh 10 million per year at 1984 prices
for the year, 1985 through 1988 in accordance witl  UEB's plan to eliminate
many of the diesel generating stations as these stations have had a history
of periodic outages and connect these locations to the national grid.
3.         Salaries and Wages.  The projection for the year 1985 reflects
the annual effect of the almost 500% salary increase granted in
July 1, 1984. A factor for staff increase of 1% per year was applied for
the years to 1986-1989 together with a factor for inflation for all years
for wages and salary increases.
4.        Repairs and Maintenance.  Repairs and maintenance was forecast at
1/2% of the gross value of revalued plant during the project implementation
period when the rehabilitation program was meeting part of the repair
requirements and 1% of the gross value of revalued plant in all subsequent
years.
5.          Transport and Travel.   Transport and Travel was  expected to
increase 50% in 1985, 15% in 1986 and 1987, 20% in 1988 and 1989 and 25% in
1990 and 1991 to reflect the increased cost of maintaining the expanded
vehicle fleet. All costs were inflated using the inflation factor.
6.           Other Expenses.   Other expenses were forecast utilizing the
inflation factor.



ANNEX 18
~ 74                  Page 2 of 2
7.             Depreciation.   Depreciation was taken at the experienced
composite rate of 2.8% on the average plant in operation on revalued cost.
8.         Interest Expense.  Interest expense has been projected based on
the terms of existing debt and anticipated terms for new debt.
Balance Sheet
10.       Plant in Operation. Plant in operation reflects the additions to
plant from the project and other works Retirements have been reflected on
project items in accordance with accounting practice which capitalises the
new plant construction in a major rehabilitation program while retiring the
old plant replaced.
11.        Accounts Receivable.  Accounts receivable were estimated at a
percentage of total reenues reflecting a constant increase in the
effectiveness of UEB's billing and collection efforts. The percentages by
year follow:
1983     -  43% actual
1984     -  40%
1985     -  30%
1986     -  25Z
1987     -  20%
1988-91 -  17%
12.        Stores.  Stores were estimated at a percentage of revalued plant
in operations as follows:
1984     -  1.4%
1985     -  1.0%
1986-87  -  2.0%
1988-91  -  1.5%
13.        Creditors and Accruals. The value of the liability to creditors
and accruals was estimated based on recent past experience at 25% of cash
operating expense and routine construction expenditures.

UGANDA SECOND POWER PROJECT
Internal Rate of Return on UEB's Investment Program
(excluding investment in next power station)
Approach to Computation of the Internal Rate of Return
1.            UEB's Investment Program  to 1989 consists of the proposed
rehabilitation project, the rural electrification schemes being implemented
with EEC assistance, uprating of the 66 kV Jinja-Kampala transmission line
to 132 kV, strengthening of the transmission lines from Kampala to Nkenda
and Tororo to Lira, and the transmission extension to Tanzania. Investment
in the next power station and the incremental demand that would be served
from it has not been included in this evaluation since this component has
yet to be firmly defined.  The incremental costs of the program are the
capital and incremental O&M costs of these investments compared to the
situation of no investments. All costs are deflated to January 1985 price
terms in equivalent US dollar terms.
2.        Benefits from the Investment Program are the difference in sales
in Uganda and to Kenya under the existing export contract and to Tanzania
under the new export contract that can be achieved with and without the
investment program.   In the without program case,  it is assumed that
exports will cease from the start of 1988 due to declining generation
capability   and that the full available capability will be used to meet
domestic demand which has a higher economic value to Uganda than exports at
prevailing export bulk tariff rates. Incremental benefits are limited by
the firm energy capability of Owen Falls Power Station.
3.         Valuation of Benefits.  Exports are valued at prevailing export
bulk tariff rates which are deflated to January 1985 price terms according
to the projected rate of international inflation. Two cases for valuation
of Ugandan sales are considered:
(i) The January 1985 average tariff yield on total Ugandan sales,
with the implication that this level will be maintained in
constant price terms throughout the life of the project; and
(ii) The projected average tariff yield on total Ugandan sales derived
from the mission's financial projections in current US dollar
terms (Annex 15) and deflated to January, 1985 price terms.
Both these estimates give an estimated financial rate of return adjusted
for price inflation and to exclude the effects of financial transfers
internal to the Ugandan economy, specifically customs duties and sales
taxes. The rates are underestimates for the economic rate of return since
they do not take account of the substantial consumer surplus above these
low tariff rates that consumers derive from the use of electric power.
4.        The projected rates of return on UEB's investment program are as
follows:

with Ugandan sales valued at the projected tariff

The cost and benefit streams for these projections are summarized on page 3

UGANDA SECOND POWER PrZOJECT
Estimate of Consumers Willingness co Pay for Electricity
1.         An estimate of consumers willingness to pay for electric power
from the public system is one of the inputs required to determine
Government policy on tariffs, along with other inputs, particularly the
long run marginal cost (LRMC) of supply and the tariff levels required to
enable UEB to meet its financial objectives. LRMC is considered to be the
minimam target level under which power consumers would pay the full cost of
supplying increases in their demand. The potential scope for tariffs to be
set above LRMC as part of Government's fiscal policy is given by estimated
consumers willngness to pay.
2.        The mission has made an order-of-magnitude estimate of consumers
willingness to pay in this Annex based on tentative assumptions.   These
estimates are only indicative, but they put into perspective the
relationship between current tariffs and LRMC. The basis of the mission's
approach is that there is a maximum price which connected consumers are
willing to pay for a given quantity of power from the UEB system.  The
price/demand relationship has to be determined from empirical observations
in the absence of analysis of consumer behavior based on reliable
information from market surveys. The relationship is estimated for each of
the three main consumer categories - residential, commercial and small
industrial,  and large industrial  consumers.   The limiting factor for
residential willingness-to-pay is a combination of fuel substitution
(kerosene and charcoal) and a limit to the proportion of household income
that consumers are willing to spend on electricity. The limiting factor
for the other consumer categories is the cost of privately-installed
generating capacity as an alternative source of power, since it is observed
that consumers in countries in East Africa have installed such capacity
when the power supply from the public system bas been unreliable (e.g.
Sudan, Uganda). Most of the demand for electricity from commercial and
industrial consumers is not sensitive to the price of electricity since it
is a vital input yet constitutes a small proportion of total production
costs.   The mission has assumed that 75% of the demand from the public
system would be price insensitive, and that the consumers would be prepared
to pay only the tariff rate in force for the remaining 25% of their
demand. The mission's estimates for consumers willingness-to-pay for power
from the UEB systam are as follows, based on analysis summarized in this
Annex.

3.        Assessment of Consumer Willingness-to-Pay for Residential Demand
for Power
(i)         Expenditure Limitation.   Under this criterion, expenditure on
electricity consumption is limited to a certain proport'on of household
income. 1/  This proportion varies with a number of factors, and in Uganda
a conservative value of 10 percent is adopted for this analysis.   The
forecast proportion at projected tariff rates and the forecast residential
specific consumption rates for residential consumers (based on the
mission's demand forecast - Annex 5) for 1985 are as follows:
Forecast Residential Demand                                    130.6 GWh
Number of Active Residential Connections                          43,355
Average specific consumption up to expenditure limit:  3,012 kWh/year
Average residential tariff:                           US cents 1.54/kWh
Average income of households connected to UEB system:    US$1000/year
Proportion of household income spent on electricity:                4.6%
The projected proportion of household income spent on electricity according
to the mission's demand forecast and projected tariff levels averages 4.3%
between 1985 and 1991.  Thus the forecast demand is not constrained by
expenditure limitations, and it would remain unconstrained at average
tariff levels of up 10.0/4.6 - 2.17 times the projected tariff level (i.e.
to US cents 3.34/kWh at January 1985 price terms). 2/ Once expenditure on
power -reaches the income limit, further increases in tariffs would result
1/  On the basis that the marginal utility of power bc-omes  zero or
negative above a particular level of consumption.
2/  This analysis assumes that all consumers are price sensitive.   In
practice some are not, but the above approach is still broadly valid
for price insensitive consumers as a means of estimating the total
val-le of their consumption.

in a decrease in consumption to maintain expenditure at the limit i.e.
price times consumption remains constant.   This relationship is used to
derive the value that consumers place on increments of consumption from the
public supply system up to a maximum price determined by fuel substitution
opportunities.   The total consumer willingness-to-pay for power from the
public supply system is derived from the following formulae:
Let p1 = present (January 1985) average residential tariff (US cents
1.54/kWh)
P2   tariff at expenditure limit (10%) of household income
(US cents 3.34/kWh)
Q= unconstrained household annual specific consumption up to the
expenditure limit (3,012 kWh/year in 1985)
P3 = maximum price that consumers will pay (taken to be
US cents 20/kWh - see para. (ii) below)
Q3 = minimum specific consumption of power from the public supply
system at the maximum price (P3)
When the tariff is above P2: P.Q = F2.QI
Q3 = P2.Q1/P3 = 503 kWh/year
Value of consumption according to expenditure limitation criterion:
,P3
V = P2.Q1 + / QdP
P3
= P2 Ql +    2.Ql-dp/P
- P2.Q1 + P2.Q1 (logeP3 - logeP2)
The equivalent average value to consumers of annual
specific consumption = V/Q1
= P2 (1 + loge P3 - loge P2)
= 3.34 (1 + 2.99 - 1.21)
= US cents 9.3/kWh
The average consumer surplus for the
annual specific consumption      = US cents (9.3-1.5)kWh
= US cents 7.8/kWh
The consumers willingness to pay for consumption Ql is restricted by the
expenditure limitation criterion to P2 i.e. US cents 3.34/kWh.
(li)       Fuel 3ubstitution.  At market prices for kerosene and charcoal
(in Kampa-a), energy values and end-use conversion efficiencies, the
equivalent values of electricity for lighting and cooking expressed in
terms of avoided costs of fuel substitutes are as follows:

End-use                  Equivalent
Energy                              Conversion Equivalent   Value in Elect-
Form         Unit    Energy Value  Efficiency Retail Price ricity Units
(TOE/OO0units)    T%)       (USt/unit)    (USt/unit)
Electricity  kWh         0.25            70
Kerosene     liter       0.83           45           43            20
Charcoal     kg          0.77            20          18            20
Thus the maximum price that residential consumers would be willing to pay
for  electricity  (P3)  without  switching  to  alternative  fuels  is  the
equivalent of US cents 20/kWh.
4.          Assessment of Consumers Willingness-to-Pay for Commercial and
Industrial Consumers.  The maximum price that these consumers would pay for
electricity from the public system is determined by the cost of installing
their  own  small  diesel  generating  sets.    For  commercial  and  small
industrial consumers, these sers would range in capacity up to 1 KW and
burn gasoil. For large industrial consumers, the diesel units would range
up to 5 MW and burn heavy fuel oi.  Estimated specific costs of power from
these units under assumed operating regimes are as follows:
Commercial and    Large
Small Industrial Industrial
Capital Cost with ancilliaries (US$/kW installed)       500           750
0&M Costs (%/yr capital cost)                            10             7
Annual Capital Cost @ 12% and 17 year life              155           174
(US$/kw/year):
Annual Plant Factor (%)                                  50            50
Equivalent Capital Cost (US cents/kWh)                    3.5           4.0
Specific Fuel Consumption (gms/kWh)                     350           250
Economic Fuel Cost (US cents/liter)                      40            33
Conversion Factor (liters/kg)                             1.18          1.06
Specific Fuel Cost (US cents/kWh)                        16.5           8.8
Total Operating Cost (US cents/kWh)                      20            I
These costs apply to the proportion of demand from the pubLic supply
system, assumed to be 75%, that consumers would supply from privately-owned
facilities if the public tariff increased above the level of these specific
costs.   The average value of power from the public system is thus the
weighted average of 75% at the specific costs of power from privately owned
facilities and 25% at the UEB tariff (equivalent to US cents 1.30/kWh in
January, 1985), amounting to US ceats 15.3/kWh for commercial and small
industrial consumers, and US ce.ts 10/kWh for large industrial consumers.
