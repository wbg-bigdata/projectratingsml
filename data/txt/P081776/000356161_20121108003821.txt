A.     SUMMARY

The proposed restructuring intends to amend the description of Part A.2 of the Project in
Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement from “(a) Construction of a centralized sludge treatment
facility with a 400 tons/day capacity at Nanzhuang to treat sewerage from five (5) wastewater
treatment plants in Foshan;? to “(a) Construction of four (4) decentralized sludge treatment
facilities with a total 220 tons/day capacity to treat sewerage sludge from the wastewater
treatment plants at Zhen’an, Shagang, Chengbei and Nanzhuang in Foshan;?. It is also proposed
to reallocate Loan proceeds, increase the disbursement percentages for selected categories, and
to extend the Loan Closing Date by one year to allow additional time to enable Foshan to
complete ongoing and planned works related to the sludge management facilities and the sewer
network. Finally, the Subsidiary Loan Agreements will be amended to reflect recent
administrative changes.

B.     PROJECT STATUS

Physical implementation is well advanced although some works are behind schedule. One major
achievement is the expansion of the Zhen'an Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) in Foshan.
These works have increased the percentage of wastewater collected and treated from 50% to
88%, thereby reducing water pollution in the Pearl River. The Wenchengsha WWTP and district
pumping stations have been completed and should begin operations shortly, thereby improving
wastewater treatment in Jiangmen. Togther, these works will further reduce water pollution in
the Delta. However, sludge disposal works in Foshan are much behind schedule as the client has
proposed a new decentralized treatment system to replace the centralized system agreed at
appraisal. The new technical design and associated land changes have been approved by the
Borrower. As this component is likely to extend beyond the Loan closing date, this restructuring
includes a one year closing date extension. Works for sediment removal are fully completed with
approximately 20.5 km having been dredged. River embankment and flood control works have
suffered extensive delays due to difficult land acquisition and resettlement, but these difficulties
have now been resolved and completion is expected by end 2012. Institutional and financial
reforms are progressing slowly and sewerage tariff adjustments are behind schedule for both
cities, and the task team will follow up with PMOs in the upcoming mission in November 2012.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Results/Indicators. Indicator number 3, “Evidence of improvement in effectiveness in
operations, management and finances of wastewater utility services under the project?, is poorly
defined and unmeasurable. It will be supplemented with five measurable indicators directly
related to the operational and financial performance of the project companies, including: “Cash
Operating Cost per Unit?, “Wastewater Volume Treated per Employee?, “Consumption of

                                                 6
Electricity per Unit?, “Cost Recovery Ratio?, “Debt Service Ratio?. Indicator number 6,
“Increases in land use rights for residential, commercial and industrial properties adjacent to
project areas?, is considered beyond the control by the Project, and will be dropped. A newly
enacted Sector Core Indicator, “Volume (mass) of BOD pollution loads removed by the
treatment plant supported under the project ? will be added.

Components. Originally the Foshan sludge treatment and disposal subcomponent was to
construct a centralized sludge treatment and disposal facility of a capacity of 400 tons/day to
treat sludge from five WWTPs. The restructuring will change the component design to
construction of four decentralized sludge treatment facilities with a total capacity of 220 tons/day
for four WWTPs. This design is sized according to the actual sludge generation quantity. These
changes will still result in reduced water pollution in the Pearl River system, and the reduction in
size will not affect the achievement of the PDO.

Safeguards. The project is already a Category “A? project, and the restructured component does
not trigger any new safeguard policies or require any exceptions to Bank policies. The
implementing agency has prepared an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), including the
Environmental Management Plan (EMP), for the Foshan sludge treatment component in
accordance with Bank requirements. This was publicly disclosed in English and Chinese on May
25, 2011, and was sent to the InfoShop and Public Information Center for disclosure on June 28,
2011 in both Chinese and English. The restructured component will promote environmental
improvements, and any adverse impacts will be site-specific and will be reduced to acceptable
levels with adequate mitigation measures. No additional land acquisition or resettlement is
required as the revised component will be implemented within the existing property sites of the
four WWTPs.

Financing.

Project Costs. The original cost of the project was estimated at US$187.9 million with the Loan
of $96 million and the Borrower financing the remaining $91.9 million. The total project cost is
now estimated at US$221.29 million, with the Borrower financing the additional US$33.39
million. The cost escalation is due to: (a) the depreciation of the US dollar from RMB 8.0 to the
dollar at appraisal to RMB 6.3 to the dollar in 2012; and (b) increases in labor and material costs.
The costs are updated in the datasheet above.

Reallocation of Loan Proceeds and Increase in Disbursement Percentages. The Loan proceeds
will be reallocated among the disbursement categories and the financing percentages for selected
categories of expenditure will be increased to complete the project activities and achieve the
PDO.

Closing Date. The Loan Closing Date is proposed to be extended by one year to December 31,
2013 to enable Foshan to complete all ongoing and planned works for the sludge management
facilities and the sewer network.

Changes to the Subsidiary Loan Agreements (SLA). All the SLAs of Foshan will be affected
by these modifications as, in addition to the change in Part A.2(a) of the Project, the Loan
allocations will be revised. Also, the Guangdong Project Management Office (PMO) has
requested that the signing entity be changed from Foshan to Chancheng District following
decentralization of the administration. All of these changes will be reflected in the revised SLAs.

D.      APPRAISAL SUMMARY

The proposed changes to the Foshan sludge treatment component described above were
appraised by the Bank on technical, economic, financial, and institutional dimensions and their
incremental impact is summarized below.

    Technical. The design of the proposed component is technically sound to reduce the sludge
     treatment capacity from the 400 tons per day estimated at appraisal to the 220 tons per day
     based on actual sludge generation data from WWTPs. This design represents the least cost
     alternative, and is based on good engineering practices. The advanced dewatering process is
     considered appropriate to meet Foshan’s landfill disposal standard of less than 60% water
     content.

    Economic. The revised component will reduce pollution loads, which will lead to improved
     water quality, positive health impacts, higher land values along the river, and other benefits.
     A least-cost analysis, comparing the cost of the centralized alternative to the decentralized
     alternative, indicates that the discounted capital and operating costs of the decentralized
     alternative are 34% lower than the centralized alternative.

    Financial. The proposed change will have a positive financial impact on wastewater
     operations in Foshan as the overall costs of sludge treatment (i.e. discounted capital and
     operating costs) will be lower.



                                                           8
   Institutional. Foshan Water Group Company (FWGC), which is already implementing all
    other wastewater components under the project in Foshan in a satisfactory manner, will
    remain as the implementation agency for the revised sludge treatment component.
