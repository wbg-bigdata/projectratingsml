THAILAND
RUBBER REPLANTING PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Government of Thailand has requested a Bank loan to assist in
financing the expansion of the ongoing program of the Rubber Replanting Aid
Fund (Fund) from 20,000 to 50,000 ha pa in the period 1976-80. This report
appraises a project for which a loan of US$50 million is proposed.
ii.       The project would provide financial and technical assistance and
would increase the organizational and operational capability of the Fund to
meet the demands of the substantially increased program. The replanting
project would be the Bank's eleventh agricultural project in Thailand.
iii.      The economy of Thailand is predominantly agricultural.  Although
the sector accounts for only 30% of GDP, it employs 75% of the labor force
and provides 70% of export earnings. However, large income disparities exist
between urban and rural areas and among regions. The main agricultural issues
which serve as the basis for Government's rural development strategy are:
(a) the need for about 320,000 jobs each year to absorb incremental rural
labor availability; (b) imprQvement of the presently very low yields of
*       rainfed crops; (c) regulation of settlement in virgin lands; (d) improve-
ment in the coordination of public agencies dealing with agriculture; and
(e) fuller use of irrigation facilities. Government has directed its agri-
cultural development strategy to the resolution of these issues and the
proposed project forms part of this strategy.
iv.       Rubber is the second most important export of Thailand, accounting
for 9.2% of total exports. The total area of rubber is estimated to be
1.7 million ha, of which 95% is located in the south west peninsula region.
Over 430,000 ha of this rubber was planted over 30 years ago with low yielding
trees and their replanting is now overdue. A further 700,000 ha of similar
stock were planted 13-30 years ago. There is, therefore, a large area of
old low yielding rubber which should be replanted.
v.        In 1960, the Government of Thailand established the Fund with the
task of implementing and supervising a grant aid program of rubber replant-
ing. Since then the Fund has carried out the replanting of 160,000 ha with
marked success.
vi.       The present level of replantings at 20,000 ha p.a. is, however,
insufficient to permit replanting all the old rubber areas within the thirty-
year economic life cycle of trees. A level of 50,000 ha p.a. would be
required to achieve this end, and would furthermore, accelerate the process
of increasing the incomes of large numbers of smallholders and be more in line
with Dresent and forecast replanting demand. With correct husbandry and
inputs  average yields in the very favorable growing conditions of South
Th&iland would reach 1,800 kg/ha, about six times present averages. Expansion of
output also offers an attractive opportunity for increased export earnings.



- ii -                                           0
vii.      The proposed Bank loan would assist in overcoming the main constraints
to the expansion of the Fund program, which are financial and organizational.
The project, which would be implemented by the Fund, would comprise all of
the Funds replanting program activities from 1976 through 1980. This would
include (a) initial replanting of about 160,000 ha and maintenance of about
120,000 ha replanted prior to 1976, (b) raising the yield of old rubber by
ethrel stimulation beginning 3 years before replanting, (c) reorientation
of rubber research to meet the needs of the smallholder, (d) technical as-
sistance and support services, and (e) management consultants to review the
Fund's structure and procedures and help implement the agreed recommendations.
viii.     Total project costs are estimated at USS148.0 million during
1976-80 with an estimated foreign exchange component of US$61.9 million or
42%. The Bank loan of US$50 million would finance foreign exchange costs
of US$36.0 million and US$14.0 million of local currency requirements. The
CDC would provide additional financing of US$6.8 million and UNDP US$1.0
million for technical assistance. The remaining project costs (US$90.2 mil-
lion) would be financed from the Fund's cess revenues (US$65 million), from
drawdown of the Fund's reserves (US$15.0 million) and from Government con-
tributions (US$10.2 million).
ix.       Fertilizer and agricultural chemicals (US$63.3 million) would be
procured by international competitive bidding according to Bank procedure.
Vehicles (US$0.9 million) would be purchased on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised locally. Most other Fund expenditures (US$83.8 million)
including cash payments to farmers, planting materials and administrative
costs are direct Fund expenditures and are not suitable for competitive
bidding.
x.        The income from rubber of a typical smallholder family cultivating
2.4 ha would increase from US$350 to US$1,750 per year at full maturity of
the rubber trees. As rubber presently accounts for about one half of cash
farm incomes in South Thailand, the five-fold increase in net incomes from
rubber production through the replacement of the present rubber stand with
high yielding varieties would in the long run more than double the agri-
cultural cash incomes in the region. Rubber constitutes the principal
source of cash income for about 75% of rural households, and income increases
due to the project would be spread over the great majority of the rural
population of Southern Thailand.
xi.       The economic rate of return of the project is estimated at 20%.
The incremental replanting program would create about 30,000 new jobs.
Incremental annual production due to accelerating the program would average
about 190,000 metric tons between 1984 and 1999. Valued at the f.o.b. price
of US65i/kg this would earn about US$120 million of foreign exchange for
the economy.

RUBBER REPLANTING PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Thailand has requested a Bank loan to assist
the expansion of the ongoing program of the Rubber Replanting Aid Fund
Board (the Fund) for the period 1976-80. This report appraises a project
for which a loan of US$50 million is proposed. With this assistance and
the support of the Rubber Research Center (RRC) of the Ministry of Agricul-
ture and Cooperatives (MOAC) and of the UNDP, the grant-aid program of the
Fund would be substantially expanded to raise the level of Fund-supported
replanting from the present level of 20,000 ha per annum to 50,000 ha by
1978.
1.02      To date, the Bank Group has made 8 agricultural loans and credits
to Thailand, all of them for irrigation. The Sirikit Dam Project (Loan
514-TH for $26 million) has been successfully completed. The North East
Irrigation Improvement (Credit 461-TH for $7.0 million), as well as the Chao
Phya Irrigation Improvement Project (Credit 379-TH for $5.5 million) are
being implemented somewhat behind schedule. A loan for the Phitsanulok
Irrigation project ($95 million) was approved in July 1975. Two loans for
the Northeast, one for rural development ($19 million), and another for
livestock development ($5.4 million) were approved by the Executive Directors
in January 1976.
1.03      The project was prepared by staff of the Fund and of the RRC with
the support of the Bank's Regional Office, Bangkok. This report is based
on the findings of a Bank Mission composed of Messrs. J. Andreu, P. Dax
and B. Gray which visited Thailand January 26 to February 22, 1975. Messrs.
J. Canty and E. Panton of the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC)
joined the mission to appraise CDC's participation in the external financing
of the rubber replanting program.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Thailand has a total area of 51.4 million ha of which 10,9 mil-
lion ha is under cultivation. The population of 39.7 million (mid-1973)
has been increasing at about 3.1% annually. In the past ten years, the
*      economy has grown annually at an average real rate of more than 7% and out-
put per capita has increased at over 4% p.a.



2.02     Thai7and's economy is predominantly agricultural.  Although the
sector accounts for only 30% of GDP, it contributes about 75% of total
employment and 70% of export earnings (mainly rice, maize, cassava, kenaf,
rubber and sugar). In 1974, rubber accounted for 9.2% of total exports
and was, after rice, the most important source of foreign exchange earnings.
The annual growth rate of agricultural output has averaged 5.5% in the past
decade and is one of the highest among developing countries in Asia.
The fact that growth of output in other sectors was more rapid accounts
for the fact that the contribution of agriculture to GDP declined from 40% in
1960 to 30% in 1970. The growth in crop production, which accounts for about 73%
of total agricultural production, has been primarily attributable to expansion
in the area cultivated at an average rate of about 4% p.a. in the period
1960-74 indicating that yields per unit of land area have increased only slightly.
New areas suitable for cultivation are rapidly diminishing, and future growth
will depend largely upon concerted efforts at intensification of production
in existing agricultural areas.
2.03      Almost 50% of agricultural holdings in Thailand are less than
2.4 ha and only 5% are 10 ha or more. There are large income disparities,
mainly between urban and rural areas, but also among the four main rural
regions of the country. The Northeast and the North are the poorest regions
with per capita incomes of US$100 and $120 respectively due to the lack of
basic agricultural resources, including insufficient and erratic rainfall.
Government is actively pushing for their development and is being assisted
in this by the Bank.  The average per capita income for the South is US$250
or roughly in line with the national average.
2.04      The main agricultural issues in the near future appear to be:
(a) finding 320,000 jobs p.a. in the agricultural sector
to absorb increases in the labor force which cannot be
taken up by other sectors;
(b) increasing the very low (and decreasing) present yields
of rainfed crops, such as rice, maize, rubber, cassave
and coconuts, to increase production and exports, and to
avoid deterioration in the incomes of smallholders;
(c) regulating the settlement and exploitation of the rapidly
dwindling virgin lands;
(d) improving the coordination of public agencies dealing
with agriculture; and
(e) making fuller use of existing irrigation facilities
and areas.

B. The Rubber Industry
2.05      Area Features.  About 95% of the Thai rubber is produced in
Southern Thailand which comprises 12% of the country's area and 10% of the
population (Annex 1). The remainder comes from thie southeast coastal area
bordering on Cambodia. In the latter area, plantations are generally young
and the need for replanting is less urgent. This section of the report is,
therefore, limited to the south.
2.06      The region has a favorable resource endowment relative to the
Northern and Niortheast regions and a relatively low population density of
about 57/km2. Nine-tenths of the population of 4 million are rural. The
oldest settlements are found along the Lastern coastal belt but since the
1930's, population pressure has caused continuing migration to the interior.
Population has been increasing at the rate of about 3% p.a. during the last
decade, and the area of virgin land suitable for agriculture is rapidly
diminishin-O .
2.07      The climate is tropical and there are rain forests to the South
and West. Rainfall averages 1,800 to 2,800 mm p.a. and is largely concen-
trated in May to December, except in the extreme south, where it is distri-
buted fairly evenly throughout the year.
2.08      The South is divided into three main land types (UMaps 1 anu 2):
(a) the western, central and southern mountain ranges and hill areas with
generally gray and red-yellow podzolic soils, covered largely by rain forests;
(b) the central and southern lowlands with colluvial and shale-derived
soils, and mostly cultivated; and (c) the cultivated sandy soils of the
coastal plains. The first two are eminently suitable for rubber and offer
few other alternatives for large scale development,
2.09      Rubber was introduced to Southern Thailand from Malaysia at the
turn of the century (Annex 2), and substantial plantings were made in the
1930's.  Infrastructure development has kept pace with expanding settlement.
The South has a wide network of health and educational facilities, as well
as the highest density of roads per km2 in the country. The region is linked
by rail with Bangkok and Malaysia and air transport is well established.
Ilowever, the expansion and improvement of port facilities have been identi-
fied as priority projects in the South Thailand Regional Development Study
(para 6.04).
2.10      Land Tenure and Farm Size.  The average total farm size in the
South is still substantially larger than in the rest of the country. MIore
than half of the agricultural area is in smallholdings of 2.5 to 6 ha each.
Problems of tenancy and landlessness are minor. However, although customary
occupancy and cultivation rights are well established, only a small propor-
tion of farmers have full title deeds to their holdings. This may become a
major problem with increasing population pressure in future.

2.11      There are about 1.6 million ha of rubber in Southern Thailand,
comprising more than half of the gross cultivated area. The number of rub-
ber holdings is estimated at about 500,000 and the average size is about 3.2
ha (20 rai). Data are limited but the Agricultural Census of 1963 indicates
the distribution of rubber holdings and of area by size of holding as
follows:
Up to 15 rai        15-60 rai        Above 60 rai
(2.4 ha)         (2.4-9.6 ha)        (9.6 ha)
% of holdings                  31                  60                 9
% of area                      10                  56                34
2.12      Yields and Production.  The average rubber yield is about 300 kg/ha,
which is one sixth of yields that can be expected under modern methods of
cultivation.  The approximate age distribution and yields are as follows:
Rubber Plantings
Area           Age of Trees           Yield
Year of Planting         ('000 ha)             (Years)           (kg/ha)
1905-1930                140                45-70              100
1931-1945                290                30-44              250              0
1946-1962                710                13-29              530/a
1963-1975                460                 1-12               70--
/a   Immature rubber area included in this calculation.
Yields of unselected and poorly maintained rubber decline markedly after
30 years of age. About 430,000 ha (25% of the total rubber area) of rubber
is more than 30 years old and the area under overaged rubber is increas-
ing at the rate of 30,000 ha p.a. At prevailing prices tapping of these
trees is unprofitable. However higher yielding rubber varieties and improved
techniques provide an opportunity for reversing the unfavorable trend in
yields and increasing rubber smallholder incomes.
2.13      Most of the rubber in South Thailand is processed into unsmoked
sheet (wet sheet) by the farmers. It is sold to thousands of small village
traders, 800 to 1,000 wholesalers and ultimately to about 18 smokers/packers/
exporters. Several independent marketing studies show that profit margins
are not excessive with farmers obtaining on-farm prices which represent
75/80% of f.o.b. prices net of taxes. Most of the rubber is exported as
Ribbed Smoked Sheet (RSS) 3 and 4 (Annex 2).
2.14      Marketing.  The main marketing constraints for the smallholder are
the uneven and generally low quality sheet they produce and the lack of
adequate sheet weighing equipment.  This results in lower prices, since
village traders must allow for risks connected with uncertain quality and



.                                           -5-
weight of the sheets they purchase. As a result of past failure with sophis-
ticated schemes, the RRC has concentrated more recently on organizing small
groups of neighboring producers into Group Marketing Organizations (GM0's)
for sheet-grading, weighing and marketing. The existing 80 CMO's have been
largely successful and as a result, participating smallholders have been
obtaining about 10% higher price for their produce (Annex 2).
2.15      Rubber packers, who are also exporters, plan to set up sufficient
block rubber processing capacity to handle most of Thailand's production by
the early 1980's. The RRC is presently investigating the best system for
smallholder processing, and the role of GMO's in adapting production to
block rubber requirements.
2.16      Rubber exports in 1974 were 380,000 mt (95% of total production)
making Thailand the third largest exporter (11% of total) following
Malaysia (50%) and Indonesia (27%). About nine-tenths of the rubber
exported is shipped from the southern ports, of Songkla, Phuket, and Pattani;
the rest is shipped from Bangkok.
C. Institutions in the Rubber Industry
2.17      There are five main Government institutions responsible for de-
velopment in the rubber sector. A brief description of their organization
and function is given in the following paragraphs.
2.18      (i)  The Rubber Replanting Aid Fund (the Fund, Annex 3).  This is
the main public sector institution responsible for the development of the
rubber industry. It was established in 1960 as an independent statutory
body to assist the replanting of old rubber holdings with high yielding
varieties, and to introduce modern methods of cultivation. The main source
of Fund revenues are the proceeds of cess levied on rubber exports. The
past implementation of the replanting program and the organization and
financial status of the Fund are described in Section III, since it is the
ongoing program of this institution that the proposed loan would help expand
and accelerate.
2.19      (ii)  The Rubber Research Center.  RRC was established in 1965
as a branch of the MOAC's Rubber Division (Annex 4). It is responsible for
research into production and processing; adaptation of research findings, and
dissemination of information among producers and processors. The RRC finances
are provided by (a) 5% of the annual proceeds of the rubber cess; and (b) bud-
get allocations of the Rubber Division. Financing has recently been adequate
partly due to a UNDP contribution of US$2.3 million largely disbursed in the
1970's. Annual expenditure averaged $ 15 million (US$750,000) per annum in
the last three years.
2.20      The RRC's Director heads two main headquarter divisions:  one for
administration and another for technical development and assistance. The
latter is divided into the following sections: agronomy, soil science,
processing technology, development, and economics.



- 6 -
2.21      The RRC staff at headquarters in Hattyai, Southern Thailand, and in
the 17 field stations spread throughout the major rubber areas, numbered 130
as of December 31, 1975. Of these, about 90 are graduates of Universities
and Agricultural Colleges. Staff are recruited on merit following civil
service procedures. Staff remuneration is based on civil service standards
and this, together with an attractive work program, has permitted recruit-
ment and retention of good staff. Since its establishment in 1965, the RRC
has greatly benefitted from UNDP/FAO technical assistance provided through
a resident team of expatriates at headquarters. The FAO team comprises ex-
perts in general research, soil science, agronomy, plant pathology and
economics. It has helped establish the main lines of the RRC's activities
and has a major role in on-the-job training of staff.
2.22      The RRC has concentrated its activities on:  (a) training of Fund
staff and rubber smallholders at both headquarters and field stations; (b)
ensuring adequate supplies of high quality planting materials through opera-
tion of the RRC inspection service for certification of planting material;
(c) disease prevention and control through advisory work; and (d) demon-
strating bud grafting and other modern techniques to planters. More re-
cently it has commenced trials with new varieties, to determine their
suitability to the different regional climates in the South. The RRC
has worked closely with the Fund in the past and is prepared to reorient
its activities in line with future program needs (paras 5.09 and 5.10).
2.23      (iii)  The Rubber Division in the MOAC has general responsibility
for implementation of Government policies in the industry, including the
regulation of dealer activities and quality standards. It is also responsi-
ble for collecting statistics in the sector. The Rubber Division produces
and distributes some of the planting material for the replanting program
(Annex 2).
2.24      (iv)  The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) in the
MOAC advises rubber growers on agricultural techniques. It has been active
in the dissemination of information concerning the replanting program, and
the identification of potential replanters. The DAE remains responsible
for general agricultural extension and for rubber extension from the second
year after tapping (Annex 2) and has been recently charged by government
with the responsibility for supporting GMOs.
2.25      (v)  The Government Rubber Estates Organization has been in
charge of production of planting materials for the major portion of the
Fund's replanting program. It has currently a capacity of producing about
14 million budded stumps per year, sufficient for field planting of about
17,500 ha.

III. THE ONGOING REPLANTING PROGRAM OF THE FUND
A. Past Implementation
3.01      About 160,000 ha, or 10% of the rubber areas of Southern Thailand,
have been replanted since the start of the Fund's operations in 1960. Re-
planting reached the rate of about 12,000 ha by 1970 and has rapidly accel-
erated since, to the present level of over 20,000 ha each year (for details
see Annex 3, Table 3).
3.02      The Fund has steadily improved its performance in terms of satis-
fying the demand for replanting grants.  The ratio of approvals to applica-
tions has risen from around 65% in the early sixties to 80% at present.
The ratio of replanted area to approved applications also rose, from around
85% in the sixties to a present level of about 95%.
3.03      Although the applications for replanting grants have increased
steadily since the beginning of the program, fluctuations in the price of
rubber introduce a random element into this demand. At periods of high
prices, the number of applications may decline because of the increased
profitability of tapping.  Applications reached a record high of about
44,000 ha in 1973.  However, in view of the very favorable prices prevail-
ing in early 1974, many replanters requested postponement of their replant-
ings, and only about half of the area was replanted. Also, due to the ex-
port embargo on fertilizer in 1974 by Malaysia, the chief source of supply
for the Thai rubber industry, the Fund was compelled to encourage this
postponement. For these reasons, applications for replanting fell off to
about 26,000 ha in 1974, of which an estimated 23,000 ha have been re-
planted in 1975. Since appraisal, the Fund's most recent estimate for
applications in 1975 is 34,000 ha. Assuming that about 75% of these appli-
cations will be approved and replanted, 1976 replantings would slightly
exceed the Fund's forecast for replanting 25,000 ha in 1976. Without
financial constraints the Fund will not have to discourage applications
in the future but would expand its promotion efforts, and should without
difficulty reach the target level of replanting 50.000 ha/year by 1978
and thereafter as proposed under the project (Annexes 5 and 6).
3.04      The Replanting Grant.  Farmers file grant requests, generally with
the help of a Fund extension officer (Annex 3, Attachment 1). To qualify for
a replanting grant a rubber farmer needs to:
(a)  have over-aged rubber trees at a minimum density of
160 trees/ha growing on an area of not less than
0.32 ha (2 rai);
(b)  have clear rights to the produce of the rubber trees
A                     to be replanted; and
(c)  have a holding with suitable soil and topography
for rubber growing.



-8-
3.05      The grant consists of materials provided in kind and of cash
payments. It is released to replanters in installments over a period of
about 6-1/2 years. Release of each installment is conditional on satis-
factory completion of specified tasks certified by an inspector. (Details
of each installment and a survey and inspection form are shown in Annex 3,
Attachments 2 and 3). Material inputs include planting material, fertilizer,
and chemicals in amounts determined by agronomic and economic considerations,
and are sufficient to reap the full benefits of modern rubber technology.
The cash component of the grant aims to alleviate the decrease of smallholder
incomes after felling the old trees, an incentive which is necessary to
induce replanting by smallholders who depend on rubber for their entire cash
income (paras 6.05 to 6.08).
3.06      The amount of the grant is determined by the Board of the Fund.
In an effort to keep up with rising costs, the Fund has raised the grant
from an initial level of 1500 Baht/rai in 1961 to 1850 Baht/rai in 1966/67
and finally to 2000 Baht/rai since 1968. However, these are nominal amounts
only. Since the material components of the grant are fixed in terms of
quantities rather than money, the fluctuations in their price affect the
actual cost of the grants. The rapid rise of compound fertilizer price by
about 140% between 1973 and 1975 resulted in an increase in the cost of the
grant to about 9 3,000/rai ($940/ha) in early 1975. Of this, 54% was
fertilizer cost, 33% cash payments for labor, 8% the cost of chemicals and
cover-crop seeds, and 5% for the cost of planting materials.  (For details
see Annex 9, Table 7.)
3.07      The Fund's system of providing grants to smallholders is well
organized, efficient, and has adequate safeguards against abuse. Material
components of the grant as well as cash-payments are supplied through the
Provincial Offices of the Fund. Delivery of planting material to the small-
holder is arranged at a time agreed between the smallholders and the field
office. In the past, fertilizer was purchased by the Fund from fertilizer
compounding firms in Malaysia.  Dealers in small towns and villages with
adequate storage facilities contract with the Fund to release fertilizer
and chemicals to rubber smallholders against presentation of a voucher.
Agricultural chemicals are distributed in a similar manner. Cash payments
are also payable at the Provincial Offices after satisfactory completion
and inspection of work. All records of payments and inspections are kept
in the replanter's individual booklet, a copy of which is kept at Headquarters.
B. Organization and Staffing
3.08      The Fund was set up in 1960 as a statutory body (Annex 3, Appendix 1
gives details of the Fund statutes and subsequent modification) and enjoys
full operational autonomy. The Director is responsible to a Board of which
lhe is a member. The Chairman of the Board is the Mtinister of Agriculture
and Cooperatives, and most of the members represent public sector agencies.
.Members are appointed by the Council of Mlinisters for 2 year terms and can



-9-
be reappointed.   Decisions are reached by simple majority vote.  The Board
sets policy, approves structural and procedural changes, annual programs
and budgets and oversees the Funds activities. In these functions the Fund's
constitution allows wide latitude.
3.09     The Fund's present organizational structure consists of five head-
quarters divisions (see Annex 3, Appendix 2) and twelve provincial offices
(ten in Southern Thailand and two in provinces near the eastern border with
Cambodia). The provincial offices administer grant payments, supervise
replantings, and provide all rubber extension to replantings up to the second
year of tapping. The provincial offices report directly to the Deputy
Director. This organizational structure is fundamentally sound, although
the expansion of the Fund's activities will require more decentralization
of functions to the provincial offices as well as the changes in organiza-
tion and procedures proposed under the Project (Annex 3, Appendix 3).
3.10      Fund staff numbered 1,170 at December 31, 1975. Of these about
80% were in field offices, and about 60% were graduates of Universities
and Agricultural Colleges.  Of the 466 field inspectors (who are also
extension officers) 20% were agronomists and 90% graduates from vocational
schools. The present size and distribution of the staff have been adequate
to carry out Fund programs successfully in the past, but would have to be
expanded and changed in line with the planned expansion of operations (para
5.07 and Annex 3, Appendix 4).
3.11      Fund recruits are selected on the basis of merit.  The quality
of Fund staff is satisfactory. One-month introductory courses on rubber
are given to new recruits by Fund and RRC staff, and shorter, specialized
courses are given to older staff. Participating replanters are given a
number of training courses which are effective and well organized.
3.12      Staff remuneration (Annex 3, Appendix 5) compares favorably with
Civil Service standards when benefits and hardship allowances are added to
basic salaries. This, and the flexibility available to the Fund for trans-
fers and promotions, has helped greatly in recruiting and keeping high
quality staff. Consequently no difficulty is expected in recruiting addi-
tional staff for an expanded program.
C. Financial Position and Fund Structure
3.13         The Fund has three sources of funds: (i) the most important one by
far is the rubber cess (Annex 6, Table 6), 95% of the proceeds of which are
given to the Fund; (ii) interest income on deposits, and (iii) government
subventions. Revenue from the replanting cess passes directly to the Fund.
By law, 90% of cess revenue is to be used for grant payments, 5% is set aside
for administrative expenses. (The remaining 5% is passed on to the Department
of Agriculture to supplement the finance of the Rubber Research Center).
The separation of administrative costs from grant payments is sound financial
practice, although the present allocation of the Fund's cess revenue
between administrative expenditures (5%) and grant payments (90%) is necessarily
arbitrary.



-10-
3.14      In the past, financial constraints have not limited the Fund's
operations; on the contrary, it has been able to accumulate reserves which
amounted to about US$30 million at the end of 1974 (Annex 3, Table 1). Also,
due to the rapid accumulation of cash balances during the build-up period
of the replanting program, interest income has been substantial (about US$17
million). This situation however, was reversed in 1974 and deficits would
continue between 1975 and 1979, even if the present level of replantings of
20,000 p.a. is maintained. This would necessitate government contributions
to fill the gap until cess revenues could cover replanting expenditures
beyond 1979 (Annex 6, Table 2).
3.15      The Act (Section 18, Annex 3, Appendix 1), specifies that interest
income is to cover administrative expenses over and above the 5% allocation
of cess revenues, and that remaining balances are to be reallocated to the
replanting fund proper. However, substantial reserves from interest income
have been allocated into three reserve funds (Land and Buildings Fund, Sub-
sidiary Fund (Annex 3, Table 2) and Unallocated Interest Reserve) in the
administrative budget whose cash balances now amount to about US$7.5 million.
Total allocations from interest income to the replanting fund proper, have
only amounted to US$2.5 million.
3.16      The Government has so far assumed only the responsibility to fi-
nance the deficits of the Fund's administrative budget.  Although interest
income would have been more than sufficient to cover the shortfall over 5%
of cess revenues from actual administrative expenses, the Government has
contributed subventions to administrative expenditures totalling about US$5
million between 1969 and 1974. Under the proposed acceleration of the re-
planting program the commitment to finance only the Funds administrative
deficits will not be sufficient (paras 4.15 and 4.16). A more rational
accounting structure is required to define the Government's commitment to
the financing of future deficits, both for administrative expenses and for
the replanting program proper.
IV. THE PROJECT - THE ACCELERATED REPLANTING PROGRAM
A. Objectives and Constraints
4.01      The main objectives of the rubber replanting program are (i) to
increase and maintain the income levels of the lowest 50% income group through
substantially increased rubber yields and (ii) to ensure that smallholdings
are viable economic units. Although rubber production increased at a rate
of about 7% during the past decade, further development under traditional
methods of planting and cultivation is constrained by (a) the rapidly diminish-
ing area of virgin lands suitable for rubber, and (b) low and decreasing
rubber yields due to the aging of the present rubber stands as well as the
persistence of traditional methods of cultivation with low maintenance stand-
ards and unselected planting material.



4.02      The Fund was created to overcome these constraints by the intro-
duction of high yielding planting material and modern methods of cultiva-
tion. The ongoing replanting program has succeeded in these objectives
although on a scale which is insufficient to eliminate the present backlog
of about 430,000 ha of rubber trees planted over 30 years ago, and at the
same time keep up with the required replacement of a further 700,000 ha
which were planted with unselected seedlings 13-30 years ago. The project
would help attain these objectives by accelerating the program to replant
25,000 ha in 1976, 35,000 in 1977 and 50,000 ha p.a. thereafter, thereby
permitting sustained renewal of all old rubber stands.
4.03      The Fund faces two major constraints to the acceleration of the
replanting program proposed above. First, the Fund's projected cess rev-
enues would be inadequate to carry out the accelerated program (or even
to maintain the program at the present level of 20,000 ha/year). The pro-
posed Bank loan, complemented with other sources of external financing,
would cover about 85% of the Fund's expected financial gap during 1976-1980.
Secondly, changes in organizational structure and procedures, as well as
increased staff, would be required to implement the program. Proposals in
this regard are detailed in Section V.
B. Project Description
4.04      The project would be carried out over four years as detailed in
Annex 7 and would comprise the entire Fund program during that period.
Principal project components would be:
(a) replanting, using improved material and techniques, of
about 25,000 ha of rubber in 1976, 35,000 ha in 1977, and
about 50,000 ha each year thereafter, involving about
80,000 rubber replanters (para 4.05 and Annexes 5 and 6);
(b) increasing the capacity of the Fund, and the Rubber
Division's nurseries to cope with the production of
high quality planting material for an annual replanting
program of 50,000 ha (para 4.06, Annex 3, and Annex 10,
Appendix 1);
(c) maintenance of all replantings administered by the Fund
(para 4.07, Annex 10, Appendix 4);
(d) establishment of about 400 Group Marketing Organizations
(GMO), (para 4.08, Annex 2, and Annex 3, Appendix 4);
(e) increasing the use of modern yield stimulation techniques
during the final 3 years prior to replanting, over an area
equivalent to 60% of the area to be replanted (para 4.09,
and Annex 10, Appendix 7);



-12-
(f) increasing training programs for Fund staff and for rubber
smallholders, in techniques of planting, field maintenance,
tapping, processing, and marketing, (para 5.08, Annex 3,
Appendix 4);
(g) technical assistance to project planning and implementation by
UNDP/FAO (para 5.10, Annex 4);
(h) establishing a monitoring system for evaluation and assessment
of the rubber development program (para 5.11, Annex 3); and
(i) review and reorganization of the Fund's structure and procedures,
with the assistance of a team of management consultants (para 5.12,
Annex 3, Appendix 6).
C. Detailed Features
4.05      The Accelerated Program.  The Fund's estimated activities in 1976
through 1980 would include replanting 160,000 ha (of which 80,000 would be
incremental), and continued development of about 120,000 ha replanted prior
to 1976 as follows:

assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations. By suitable
arrangement, the nurseries of the Rubber Division of the MOAC and private
nurseries approved by the Rubber Division and the RRC would also provide
planting materials. 1/ Quality of planting material would be assured by
RRC's certification. Delivery of planting material to the smallholder

would be coordinated and arranged by the Fund field offices. It is antici-
pated that some 75% of the planting material required for a 50,000 ha p.a.
program could be produced by the Government Rubber Estates Organization's
nurseries. 1/ During the project period, the total area of budded stumps
nursery will increase from about 250 to 400 ha (Annex 10, Appendices 1 to 3).
4.07      Land Clearing, Planting and Maintenance.  Land clearing involves
felling and burning of the old rubber stand and eradication of weed growth.
This is followed by establishment of a leguminous cover crop in the avenues
between the rows to be planted with young rubber trees. So far most land
clearing has been done by hand. This has resulted in labor shortages, de---
lays and unfinished programs due to the very short (3-4 months) land clearing
season. It is important that nursery and field activities are coordinated so
that planting coincides with the wet season. To accelerate land clearing,
the Fund would help further develop a system of contracting with private en-
trepreneurs for chain saw felling (Annex 10, Appendices 4 to 6). Under this
system individual smallholders would remain free to employ contractors or
to use their own family labor and tools for manual felling. (Provision of
chain saws to individual smallholders would not be practicable).  After
planting, maintenance would be routine, consisting mainly of timely appli-
cation of fertilizer, weeding and disease control and would be closely super-
vised by the Fund as in the past.
4.o8      Harvesting, Processing and Village Marketing.  The main requirement
in the production of high quality sheet rubber is cleanliness during tapping,
collection, and processing. The technique is straightforward and well
understood by farmers. Trees are tapped in the morning at 2 or 3 day intervals.
On this basis, one tapper is able to tap, collect and process latex into
wet sheet (unsmoked sheet) from an area of 2-3 ha during a working aay ex-
tending from about 6 a.m to 12 noon. The majority of unsmoked sheet produced
will continue to be marketed through present systems during the project
period (para 2.13). Following up the considerable RRC experience with
Group Marketing Organizations, the Fund would establish 400 new GMOs
(Annex 2). With the planned increase in staffing, this target is feasible.
Participating smallholders would improve the quality of their rubber and
obtain about 10% increase in price as in the past.
4.09      Yield Stimulation.  In the years preceding replanting, it is feasi-
ble to maximize returns from low yielding holdings through ethrel stimulation
and, ultimately, by slaughter-tapping. Ethrel stimulation increases yields
of old trees by 50-100% for about three years (Annex 10, Appendix 7). As
smallholders would normally replant their holdings in stages (Annex 9), the
additional income derived from ethrel stimulation and modern methods of
slaughter tapping would help smallholders bridge the period of decreased
income while only a part of their holding is productive. Therefore, inten-
sification of tapping in the last years of the trees would add an incentive
to the timely replanting of over aged rubber trees.

4.10      The Fund estimates that about 60% of old rubber holdings are suita-
ble for intensified latex exploitation by tapping reserves of high-level
virgin bark with the indicated techniques. Fund staff already instruct
replanters in these techniques. To cope with the expanded program, the
number of Fund instructors would be trebled by 1977. The Fund would make
provisions to provide replanters with ethrel at cost.
4.11      Ecological Aspects.  Replanting will be confined to flat or un-
dulating lands containing soils of known suitability for tree crop development.
The leguminous ground cover which will be sown immediately after clearing
will adequately safeguard against erosion and siltation, The project does
not involve large scale centralized processing. Processing will continue to
be carried out on a small scale on individual farms and pollution would be
negligible.
D. Cost Estimates

4.13      Base costs are estimated at 1976 prices, on the basis of the
present level and composition of grant payments. Provisions for expected
price increases for fertilizers are based on the Bank projected price
index for world commodity trade, and for all other inputs, on the projected
wholesale price index for Thailand. The rates of price increase forecast
by these indices are as follows:
1976/77    1977/78    1978/79    1979/80 and after

No provision for physical contingencies has been made since the project com-
prises a "time slice" of a large investment program where the major sources
of uncertainty and risk do not lie in the estimates of the physical and
administrative requirements of implementation.

E. Financing
4.14          Project costs from 1976-80 would be financed in the following
amounts and proportions:
Local Sources       External Sources               F.E. of
Fund     Government   IBRD   CDC     UNDP   Total      Total
US$ Million           80.0       10.2        50.0   6.8     1.0   148.0    61.9
Percentage of Project
cost                54.0        6.9       33.8   4.6       .7   100.0      41.8
Outside funds would be made available to the Fund as grants. Bank-financed
expenditures are detailed in Annex 5, Table 6. CDC have agreed in principle
to provide additional cofinancing of about US$8.0 million. Arrangements for
CDC's participation in assisting the project were finalized during
negotiations. UNDP would finance technical assistance to the project.
4.15          During the proposed project period, the Fund's projected cash
resources would amount to only about US$80.0 million (Annex 6). Assuming
*Jk external financing of the program as proposed above, the Fund would still
face a deficit of US$10.2 million.  This moderate deficit could be met from
Government budgetary allocations without undue difficulty, since the deficit
would amount to less than 5% of projected export taxes on rubber during the
same period.  However, during the subsequent four-year period (1980-1983),
the Fund's average yearly deficits are projected at US$30 million (Annex 6,
Table 2).
4.16          in view of the above, the Government's commitment to finance the
Fund's impending deficits during and beyond the project period is crucial
to the implementation of the accelerated replanting program. By controlling
the level of taxes and grant payments, as well as the allocation of taxes
between the export tax and the replanting cess, the Government has consider-
able flexibility in controlling the Fund's financial position. Options for
financing the deficits include (i) raising the cess, (ii) budgetary alloc-
ions, (iii) continuing recourse to external financing, or (iv) a combination
of these measures. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the
Government would (i) provide the Fund with the necessary funds to finance
the deficits involved in carrying out the project and sustaining the program
at a rate of 50,000 ha/year; (ii) at the request of the Bank review in con-
sultation with the Bank and the Fund the financing requirements of the Fund
to carry out the Project and thereafter to continue with the implementation
of the Replanting Program. Assurances were also obtained that the Govern-
ment would (i) consult with the Bank prior to changing the evel of taxes
and duties on rubber production, marketing and export, as well as of the
Rubber Cess levied pursuant to Section 5 of the replanting act and (ii)
e  at the request of the Bank, review in consultation witn the Bank and the
Fund the rates of the Rubber Cess and of any other taxes or duties levied
on the production, marketing, and export of rubber.

F. Procurement
4.17          Fertilizers and chemicals (US$63.3 million) would be procured in
bulk through international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank proce-
dures and the usual preference would be granted to local manufacturers.
Contracts for vehicles (US$0.9 million) would be awarded on the basis of
competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with the Fund's
usual procurement procedures. Vehicles would be procured in small groups
and purchases would be scattered in time and place, hence international
competitive bidding mould not be appropriate. Foreign manufacturers of
vehicles are well represented in Thailand. About 75% of the required planting
material would be initially provided by the Government Rubber Estates Organization.
Their nursery and private nurseries would supply planting material at competitive
prices. Cover crop seed would be purchased from private sources, mainly
smallholders. The remaining costs are direct Fund expenditures for grant
cash payments and administration. The Finance Division of the Fund is responsible
for all matters relating to procurement.
G. Disbursements
4.18          Disbursements are detailed in Annex 5, Table 7. The Bank would
disburse:
(a)   60% of the c.i.f. costs of either directly impcrted
fertilizers and chemicals, or of the ex-factory price
if manufactured locally, or of local expenditures ex-store
if imported but procured locally,
(b)   100% of the c.i.f. cost of directly imported vehicles,
or 100% of ex-factory price if locally manufactured, or
65% of local expenditures ex-store for imported vehicles.
(c)   40% of the cost of planting materials released to
replanters, against the Fund's statement of expenditure
based on the reports of the field inspectors and certified
by the Fund's Deputy Director for Administration and Finance,
(d)   21% of the first two installments of individual labor
payments to replanters, against the Fund's statement
of expenditures as above in (c),
(e)   21% of salaries of field staff (that is field inspectors,
instructors and GMO officers), against the Fund's statement
of expenditures as certified by the Fund's Deputy
Director for Administration and Finance.

a                                         -'19 -
(f)  100% of foreign currency costs or 85% of total costs
of consultants.
4.19      Disbursements for items (c) and (d) would directly link disburse-
ments to the progress of implementation. Disbursement requests would be
prepared on the basis of field inspectors' certificates of delivery of
planting materials and labor payments. (The first installment of the grant
for labor payments is released to farmers after the completion and inspec-
tion of land-clearing and preparation; the second after the completion and
inspection of planting (Annex 3, Attachment 3). Similarly, disbursements
for field staff would link disbursements with the Fund's overall effort to
provide the required field services to the program. The documentation for
items (c), (d) and (e) would be retained by the Fund and be available for
inspection by the Bank during project supervision.
H. Accounts and Auditing
4.20      The Fund would keep adequate records to reflect, in accordance
with sound accounting practices, their operations and financial condition.
This would require, among other things, the reorganization and consolidation
.       of their accounts (para 3.16) into two main categories; i.e. planting and
administration.  The Fund would have their accounts audited by the National
Auditing Council at the end of every financial year on the basis of guide-
lines agreed by the Bank (Annex 3, Appendix 7). Internal auditing is
presently carried out by the Finance Division. To ensure adequate financial
controls, an Internal Audit unit would be established, directly responsible
to the Director. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the
Fund would (i) maintain adequate records to reflect, in accordance with
sound accounting practices, its financial operations, (ii) submit to the
Bank within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year, copies of its audited
financial statements and reports, and (iii) establish and staff an Internal
Audit unit directly responsible to the Board, within six months of the loan
signing.
V. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATION
5.01      The project would be executed by the Fund.  The RRC, the UNDP/FAO
team and the management consultants would assist the Fund in the implementa-
tion of the accelerated program. This assistance to project planning and
implementation and to training is required to increase the capability of
the Fund to carry out the expanded program.
The Fund
5.02      Management.  Competent management has been an important factor
in the success of the Fund Program. Government intends to extend the
present Director's contract through the end of 1977 when he must retire



- 20 -
for reasons of age. The Director's replacement with an experienced and
qualified individual is essential to the program. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that appointment of the Fund's Director and Deputy Direc-
tors would be subject to consultation with the Bank.
5.03      In view of the increased program an additional Deputy Director
is required. Assurances were obtained that, in consultation with the Bank
and within six months of loan signing, an experienced certified public
accountant would be appointed to an additional Deputy Director post and
charged with the Fund's administrative and financial responsibilities.
5.04      Organizational Structure.  The Fund's proposed organization chart
is in Annex 3, Appendix 3. Changes in organizational structure are required
by the Fund's expanded scope of activities and have been agreed to by the
Fund's management. The establishment and staffing of a new Development
Division would be the most important change. The Division would assume
headquarters responsibility for field advisory and support activities in-
cluding: extension work in relation to rubber establishment and production
(with the exception of those duties assigned to the DAE), intercropping,
ethrel stimulation, processing and marketing; staff and smallholder-training;
establishment and operation of demonstration plots; and production of plant-
ing material. The Provincial Offices would remain the key units in program
implementation with responsibility at field level for operation of the re-
planting grant, according to the procedures detailed in Annex 3.  The Pro-
vincial Offices would also provide field extension services to smrallholders.
The Replanting Division would remain responsible for the administrative
aspects of the replanting program, such as the processing of surveys, grant
applications and field inspection reports. At present, processing of grant
applications is dealt with by a Computer Section in the Replanting Division.
This arrangement has been adequate so far. However, it will be necessary to
expand the Section's responsibilities, to include financial transactions and
inventory controls, in which case the Section should be placed directly under
the responsibility of the Deputy Director for Administration and Finance.
Assurances on the establishment and staffing of the Development Division
and on the transfer of the Computer Section, within six months of loan
signing, were obtained during negotiations.
5.05      Procedures for Processing Grant Applications.  The Fund aims to
approve all valid grant applications in time for rubber to be planted within
one year of submitting an application. Computerization has greatly increased
the rate of processing of grant applications at headquarters. However further
improvements in processing are needed, particularly in view of the expanded
program. These and other organizational procedures would be reviewed by the
management consultants (para 5.12) who would formulate recommendations for
improvement and implementation following consultation between the Fund and
the Bank.
5.06      There is considerable scope for increasing the number of land
surveys carried out and for distributing the survey work over a greater
part of the year.  This would lead to a larger and more even flow of grant
applications for processing.



-21-
5.07    Staff Requirements for Program Administration.  The increase in
staff numbers required for the expanded program would be almost completely
utilized in the field. The phasing of staff increases is detailed in
Annex 3, Appendix 4. Given the ready availability of agricultural school
graduates and the favorable terms and conditions of employment offered
by the Fund, there would be no difficulty in recruiting the 40% additional
staff required.
5.08    Staff Training.  The present training courses (Annex 3, Appendix 4)
would be expanded to cope with the needs of the accelerated program.
There are advantages in centralization of staff-training and an assurance
was obtained at negotiations that the Borrower would ensure that the facilities
of MOAC's agricultural station at Kanthuli are available to the Fund.
Staff would be trained by Fund and RRC instructors at Kanthuli in techniques of
nursery and field establishment, intercropping, maintenance, tapping,
processing and marketing.
The Rubber Research Center and the UNDP/FAO Technical
Assistance to the RRC and the Fund.
5.09        RRC's research program, which is assisted by an ongoing UNDP/FAO
*   project, would be modified to service the Fund's expanded replanting program
(Annex 4). The RRC has gained valuable experience in the promotion of GMO0's
and the training of rubber replanters. While these are not research activities,
they were successfully initiated by RRC on a pilot scale. An assurance was
obtained during negotiation that RRC would expand and reorientate its activities
in accordance with the requirements of the replanting program.
5.10        UNDP/FAO would assist the program by providing expatriate staff
assistance as outlined below.
5.11        Staff Assistance would be provided through two teams serving the
RRC and the Fund respectively for the period of the project. The first team
would continue to assist the RRC research effort and would also backstop
the accelerated Fund program as required. The second team would comprise among
others a Senior Technical Advisor, a Senior Development Officer and a Senior
Economist who would assist the management of the Fund, with Fund executives
as counterparts. The first of these would be attached to the Fund's Director.
The second would assist the Chief of the New Development Division primarily
in the implementation of the expanded programs for replantings, technical
assistance, nurseries and smallholder training courses.  The third would help
establish a Planning Unit, which would monitor project implementation
particularly with regard to the socio-economic impact of the program, smallholder
incentives and participation, and consequent policy formulation (para 6.08).
Assurances were obtained from the Fund during negotiations that this Planning
Unit would be created directly under the Fund's director and staffed within
v    six months of loan signing.

5.12      Consultant Services would be provided to the Fund and RRC.  Man-
agement consultants would be appointed to conduct a full review of the Funds
organization structure, operating procedures, accounting systems, data pro-
cessing and staffing. This is necessitated by the considerable expansion
of the Fund program and the substantial increase in its operations. Certain
obvious improvements needed have been described above in this Section. The
Fund would select and appoint a firm of consultants, in consultation with the
Bank, with terms of reference (Annex 3, Appendix 6) satisfactory to the Bank,
to review the Fund's organization and procedures, formulate recommendations,
and assist with the implementation of such recommendations as would be agreed
in consultation between the Fund and the Bank. The consultants would commence
their assignment within 6 months of signing the loan agreement, would spend
about 6 months formulating their review and recommendations, and a subsequent
12 months for implementing recommendations. The three consultants envisaged
would be appointed by an approved consulting firm and would work for about
55 man-months at a cost of about US$4,200 per man-months. Assurances with
respect to the above were obtained during negotiations.
5.13      Promotional activities would be undertaken by the Fund.  Promotion
would include increased publicity for the replanting program through multi-
media mobile shows, which would also support the extension effort of the Fund's
newly created Development Division (para 5.04).
Technical Co-ordination
5.14      Co-ordination of technical services is essential to the success
of the program. The Fund will rely heavily on technical services (covering
a wide-range of subject matter) from the RRC and UNDP/FAO team for both staff
training and technical advice in the field. The Fund is responsible for ex-
tension services to rubber replanters until the beginning of the second year
of tapping, after which the DAE assumes the responsibility for extension.
There is clearly a need to ensure timely provision of technical assistance
to the program. Government would form, within the MOAC a Technical Assistance
Co-ordinating Committee, with the Undersecretary of MOAC as chairman, which
would represent the Fund, the RRC and its FAO advisors and the DAE. This
Committee would (i) determine the activities in which the Fund required
technical assistance from these institutions; (ii) monitor the implementation
of this assistance; and (iii) resolve any problems which may arise. Assurances
to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
VI. YIELDS, MARKETING AND FINANCIAL BENEFITS
A. Yields and Production
6.01      Rubber would begin yielding in the sixth year after replanting
with budded stumps and in the seventh year when planted with seed at stake.
At full maturity, from years 14 through 26, estimated yields are 1.8 tons



- 23 -
of dry rubber per ha, declining thereafter (Annex 9, Table 11). These
yield estimates are based on results obtained by smallholders using
improved technology in Southern Thailand. They reflect the relative
absence of serious yield limiting factors such as wind damage, root
disease and brown bast. The estimates are in line with yields of
equivalent material in Mialaysia, under similar growing conditions and with
good smaliholder management; and are about 20% higher than yields expected
in Indonesia, where serious management problems prevail.
B. Marketing
6.02      Production increases from accelerating the replanting program
will not occur until the early eighties. Beyond 1980 the world demand
for natural rubber appears favorable. The demand for all rubber is estimated
to grow at 6% per annum between 1980-85 whereas the natural rubber supply
over the same period is projected to increase at only 3.7% per annum.
There is, therefore, a strong probability of a shortfall of natural rubber
in the eighties. Incremental production (Annex 6, Table 7) should be
accommodated in the world market without difficulty (Annex 8).
6.03      Local marketing systems are described in paras 2.13 to 2.1h.
The project would contribute to the expansion of group marketing (para 4.08).
6.o4      Port capacity in the South is limited and although transhipment
through Malaysian ports could be expanded substantially, shortage of capacity
could adversely affect rubber export in the early 1980's. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that Government would (i) present to the Bank
proposals for expansion of port facilities in the South within 12 months of
loan signing and (ii) review the proposals in consultation with the Bank
and thereafter implement an expansion program for port facilities in the
project region.
C. Farmer Benefits
6.05      Average yields of rubber in South Thailand are about 300 kg/ha.
Mature yields under high technology rubber production are estimated to
be 1,800 kg/ha, or about six times the present average.  Farmer benefits
are quantified for two distinct kinds of producers, smallholders using
their family labor (para 6.06) and commercial producers using hired
labor (para 6.07).
6.o6      The income from rubber of a typical smallholder cultivating 15
rai (2.4 ha) with family labor is shown in Annex 9, Table 4). His net
farm income would rise from the present level of about 0 7,000 per year
to about % 35,000/year, from the 20th year after the start of replanting until
about the 35th year. However, because of the felling of old rubber trees and th



- 24-
long period of maturation, no significant increases of income would occur
until 10 years after the start of replanting. The farm budget shows the
importance of the cash component of the grant in levelling the smallholder's
income stream, assuming that holdings are replanted in three stages and
intercropped over 7 years to minimize short-run decreases in income. The
cash component of the grant is sufficient to prevent a reduction of small-
holder incomes, taking into account the added income from ethrel stimulation
prior to felling, and from intercropping after replanting. This together
with the long run potential for a five-fold increase in net income provides
adequate incentive for smallholders to replant.
6.07      The financial rate of return of replanting rubber on a commercial
scale, with hired labor and with the assistance of the grant payment, is
estimated at 40% after taxes (Annex 9, Tables 5 and 6).
6.08      An important policy issue permanently facing the Fund is the
determination of the appropriate level of the grant payments. The argument
for cash incentives under the grant applies differently to the above two
categories of producers, that is family operated smallholdings and larger
units using hired labor. With respect to the former, the aim of the cash
incentive is to prevent a reduction of income after felling old rubber trees
and during the subsequent years of immaturity. With respect to the latter,
the incentives of the grant for replanting can be evaluated in terms of the
rate of return of investment.  As shown above, the present level of grant
payments provides sufficient incentives on both considerations. However,
because of the crucial importance of sufficient farmer incentives for the
implementation of the program, assurances were obtained during negotia-
tions that (i)   by Septeiuber 1, 1977, the Fund would submit for
the Bank's consideration a socio-economic survey of farmer-participation in
the replanting program, (ii) on the basis of this survey and thereafter yearly
following similar surveys, the Fund would review the level of grant aid to
ensure that it provides adequate incentive for smallholders to replant, and
(iii) that changes in the level and composition of the replanting grant
would only be made after consultation with the Bank.
6.09      Total grant payments each year are allocated 70% to smallholdings
up to 50 rais (8 ha), 20% to medium holdings up to 250 rais (40 ha) and 10%
to plantations with more than 250 rais. While the intent of the law is to
ensure the priority of family size holdings under the program, the present
data kept by the Fund does not allow for verification of compliance with this
stipulation. While information exists with respect to the distribution of
replanting grants by size of lots replanted there are no data regarding the
size distribution of the total holdings of beneficiaries, or the number of
lots replanted by the same owner. During negotiations, assurances were ob-
tained that the Fund would maintain adequate records of farmer participation
in the program by holding size and ownership.
6.10      While tenancy and landlessness are not significant in rubber
growing areas, only a very small percentage of cultivators possess title deeds
to their holdings (para 2.10). The issuance of title deeds to replace cus-
tomary rights of cultivation and occupancy is desirable, and it is Government



- 25 -
policy to expedite this process. During negotiations, assurances were ob-
tained from Government that it would submit to the Bank for its comments
by January 1, 1977, proposals for coordinating the land surveys of the Fund
(which are carried out prior to the approval of applications for a replant-
ing grant), with the establishment of occupancy rights of rubber growers;
and for the acceleration of the issuance of title deeds to participating
cultivators of rubber holdings in the Project Area.
D. Government Cash Flow and Cost Recovery
6.11     The fiscal implications of accelerating rubber replantings to
50,000 ha/year (instead of maintaining these at the present level of
about 20,000/ha) are detailed in Annex 6. The rate of return of the
incremental consolidated government cash flow due to accelerating the
replanting program is estimated at 10% (in current prices and until 1999
(Annex 6, Table 1)).
6.12      Net transfers from the rubber sector from an export tax of 1.9 %/kg
and the replanting cess of 0.6 B/kg would be about US$25 million in 1975.
(Tax receipts are expected to grow faster than production, because with the
present formula for taxing rubber (Annex 9, Table 9), increases in the price
level will increase the real rate of taxation (Annex 6, Table 6).)
6.13      Without accelerating the programs, the net resource transfer
from the rubber sector, in current terms, would grow at the rate of about
30% between 1975 and 1979, as opposed to a lower 20% rate with the accel-
erated replanting program. 1/ However, this still leaves an ample margin
for the supplementary financing of the Fund's expected deficit during the
project period (para 4.15).
6.14      The Government's rate of return on the grant payments incurred in
replanting one ha of rubber (and "repaid" by consolidated tax receipts)
is estimated at 12% (in constant 1975 prices, and with the rate of
taxation constant at the 1975 level, see Annex 9, Table 5 and 9).  As indicated
above, this estimate is conservative, since the real rate of taxation would
rise.
6.15     The above paragraphs deal with the consolidated Government cash-
flow due to the replanting program. However, the Fund itself is conceived
as a self-financing revolving fund whose expenditures in the long run should
be financed from cess revenues. While rubber holdings planted with high
yielding varieties would provide more than enough cess revenues over 30
years (US$1,100/ha) to meet the cost of the grant (US$940/ha) the cess
revenues derived from holdings of average yields would only amount to about
US$230/ha over the same period.  Therefore, although at present yields the
grant payment to farmers far exceeds their past contribution to the cess
fund, the Fund would fully recover these costs through the lifecycle of
high-yielding rubber trees.

6.16      Recovery of the replanting grant by the replanting cess during
the transition from unselected to high-yielding varieties is illustrated
below. The recovery ratio (cess revenues over grant payment) Is indicated
for three cases:
(a)  a holding replanted at the start of the Fund's operation
(which had therefore not generated cess revenues prior to
replanting);
(b)  a holding being replanted in 1976 which has been generating
cess revenues for half the life-cycle (15 years) of the
unselected rubber trees; and
(c)  a holding that will be replanted thirty years from the
start of the Fund's operation in 1960, having been planted
with unselected seedlings at that time.

6.17      The past and projected cashflow of the Fund (Annex 6) reflects the
transition in collecting ceases from a low-yielding to high-yielding rubber
stand, as well as the steadily increasing participation of replanters in the
program. While the relatively low participation of replanters during the
start-up phase of the program resulted in the accumulation of US$30 mil-
lion in the Fund's reserves, the Fund will incur an average annual deficit
of about US$25 million from 1975 to 1990, after which it will again oper-
ate at surpluses until the end of the century (Annex 6).
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      Accelerating the rubber replanting program would result in a faster
rate of growtb of incomes and production in South Thailand, fuller employment
in the region, and increased foreign exchange earnings for the economy. The
program would help establish the rubber industry on a sound agricultural and
financial basis, improve the Fund's organization and capability, and set the
basis for a continuous replanting effort at optimum annual levels for the
indefinite future. The establishment of G1M0's, which would also be accel-
erated under the program, would improve rubber quality standards and further
improve farmers' incomes.



-27 -
7.02      Incremental production due to accelerating the program would reach
about 100,000 tons (10% of forecast production) by 1990 and about 400,000
tons (20% of forecast production) by the year 2000. Incremental production
would average about 190,000 tons/year between 1984 and 1999,  Valued at
the f.o.b. price of US 65 £/kg, this would earn about US$120 million a year
of foreign exchange of the economy or about 6% of present foreign exchange
earnings. Assuming that in the absence of the acceleration of the program,
rubber production would continue to grow at 6% between now and the end of
the century, the annual incremental production due to accelerating the
program would amount to about 20% of total Thai production by 1999 (for
details see Annex 6, Table 1).
7.03      The economic analysis of the project is conducted in terms of the
costs and benefits of replanting one rai (0.16 ha) of land, and assuming that,
in the absence of the replanting program, the overaged rubber holdings would
eventually be replanted with unselected rubber seedlings and low technology
techniques would persist. The economic rate of return of the project thus
calculated is 20%. Details of the analysis are given in Annex 9.
7.04      The labor requirements of maintaining high technology rubber pro-
duction are only marginally higher than the labor requirements of traditional
rubber production. However, the clearing and land preparation of an incre-
mental 30,000 ha/year under the replanting program would create the same
number of jobs per year as of 1978 (Annex 9). Thus, the acceleration of the
program would contribute to a fuller utilization of both hired and family
labor in Southern Thailand. The program would not have a significant impact
on income distribution (Annex 9). However, as rubber presently accounts
for about one-half of cash farm incomes in South Thailand, the five-fold
increase in rubber incomes would in the long run alone more than double
agricultural cash incomes in the region. Rubber constitutes the principal
source of cash income for about 75% of rural households and income increases
due to the program will be spread over the great majority of the rural popula-
tion.

ANNEX 1

THAILAND
RUBBER REPLANTING PROJECT
Southern Thailand
1.        Location and Area.  Southern Thailand is defined as the southwest
peninsular region of the country, extending for approximately 600 km in
length between latitudes 6° to 11°N, with an average width of 120 km. It
borders on the west with Burma and the Andaman Sea, on the east with the
Gulf of Thailand, and on the south with Malaysia (Map 1). The peninsula
has an area of 7 million ha and comprises slightly more than one seventh
of the whole country.
2.        Climate, Topography, and Soils.  The climate is basically tropical
monsoon in type, and tropical rain forest exists to the south and west. The
northeast monsoons bring heavy rains from November through February, but a
distinct dry season follows from January through May. The southwest mon-
soon July-October is the second wettest season of the year. Within this
framework, rainfall patterns differ according to several microclimates,
rainfall averaging from 1800 to 2800 mm p.a., being heavy and concentrated
in short periods (northwest) and more evenly distributed throughout the year
(south). In summary, the climate is variable and has important implications
for the planting seasons within the region.
3.        Southern Thailand is divided into three main types of land area
(Maps 1 and 2):
(a) the western, central and southern mountain and hill
ranges, representing 45% of the area, with elevations
up to 2,000 mt and generally steep topography covered
by rain forests;
(b) the central and southern lowlands, representing about
25% of the area, largely cultivated, especially in the
south; and
(c) the eastern and western coastal plains, comprising 30%
of the area.
4.        There are large granitic intrusions in the mountain areas resulting
in medium to fine textured gray and red/yellow podzolic soils. The lowland
soils are mostly colluvial and shales are abundant. Those of the coastal
belts are largely sandy and shallow apart from the peat swamps. Few soils
of the peninsula can be classified as very fertile, but most are adequate
for tree crops (Map 2). Wind is only a constraint in the extreme north of
the peninsula.



ANNEX 1
Page  2
5.        There are two main river basins in the south, the Tapi and the
Trang both in the central lowlands, but smaller rivers and permanent streams
are widely distributed. Drainage is only a major problem in the peat swamps
along the coast.
6.        Population.  The population at about 4 million (57 inhabitants/km2)
represents about 10% of the country's total population and is growing at 3.0%
p.a. Originally settlement was concentrated along the eastern coastal belt,
where rice and coconuts were grown. With increased population pressure,
migration to the central and western areas set in, and this process con-
tinued. Most of the migration is between rural areas and as a result only
10% of the population is urban. The main urban centers are at Hatt Yai/
Songkla, which together comprise the most active production/communication
centers and growth poles of the region, and Trang (Map 1). Most of the
inhabitants of the southernmost provinces are of Malaysian extraction and
are Muslim.
7.        Infrastructure.  South Thailand was practically isolated from the
rest of the country until the 1920's when the railroad connecting it with
Bangkok was built. To remedy the continuing regional isolation, Government
built a main paved road from Bangkok to the Malaysian border in the 1960's
(Map 1).  This was followed by the construction of a major network of feeder
roads.  Southern Thailand now has the greatest length of roads per km2.  The
main ports are Songkla, Phuket and Pattani (Map 1), all of which are oper-
ated by private interests at well below potential capacity, due to insuffi-
cient port facilities and access canals. This will constitute a serious
problem for expanded rubber exports in future and the S. Thailand Regional
Study identified port expansion as a major requirement. There are all
weather airfields in the main towns. Radio and telephone communications
are adequate. The region is well served with schools and dispensaries.
8.        Land Tenure and Cultural Practices.  Most farmers occupy the land
they operate and tenancy is not a problem. Furthermore, most of the rural
families have land due until recently, to the availability of virgin forest
land. However, most of the forest lands are Government reserves, and the
present settlers, while unlikely to be evicted, may have to pay nominal
rents to Government in the future.
9.        Occupancy rights in Thailand are of three major types:
(a) Sor Kor 1, comprising about 60% of the region's
occupied area, which protects those who possessed
land before the promulgation of the Land Code of
1954, and permits inheritance but not sale of the
land;
(b) Nor-Sor 2 (20% of the area) which provides tem-
porary rights to squatters, giving them the oppor-
tunity to cultivate 75% of the plot area in three
years, and thereafter, obtain



ANNEX 1
Page  3
(c) Nor Sor 3 (20% of the area), certificates which
can be turned into land titles as soon as cadastral
surveys are made.
A full cadastral survey appears improbable in the next 10 years. There
appear to be no serious tenancy problems, since individual occupancy rights
are largely well known and undisturbed. For permanent tree crop develop-
ment, the legal requirement is to have clear title to the trees and pro-
duce to qualify for Government and financial and technical support. This
is sufficient for participation in the replanting program. Issuance of
title deeds rather than occupancy certificates would be preferable and
during negotiations arrangements would be explored for confirming land
ownership of participants in the replanting program.
10.       Land is distributed approximately as follows:  holdings between
5 and 10 ha represent 32% of the number, and 50% of the area; holdings
between 1 and 5 ha, comprise 50% of the number, and 30% of the area; the
small balance largely represents medium sized properties (up to 300 ha).
There are no large estates of the Malaysian type.
11.       Rubber (1.6 million ha) and forestry (2.2 million ha) are major
industries in the Central Region of the peninsula, while on the coast, and
to a lesser extent in the central lowlands, tin, rice (1 million ha) and
coconuts (150,000 ha) predominate.  Yields of all crops are low, e.g. 1.2
tons/ha for rice, 0.9 tons/ha for copra and 0.3 tons/ha from old, unimproved
rubber. Furthermore, yields of rubber and copra are generally declining due
to a combination of age and soil fertility levels. Virgin lands with ini-
tially high fertility status are becoming increasingly scarce, and a con-
certed effort is needed to improve the productivity of the existing cul-
tivated areas. The rubber replanting program focuses on this problem and
would play a major role in upgrading productivity over about half of the
existing agricultural land in the southern Peninsula.
12.       GRP and Family Incomes.  The GRP of the south has increased at
about 6% p.a. in the last 6 years, which, allowing for population growth,
has resulted in a net increase of 3.5% p.a. Family incomes and the impact
of the replanting program are discussed in Annex 9.
Average incomes are relatively high compared with other regions of Thailand
as shown below:
Region         GDP p.c.        % of Population
(US$)
Central           480                30
Southern           250               12
Northern           180               18
Northeast          120               40



ANNEX 1
Page  4
This is due to: the ready availability of virgin lands (until recently);
the relatively large size of smallholdings; the varied sources of rural
income (and of foodstuffs), such as fishing, rice, coconut and rubber
planting, rubber tapping, and tin and forestry exploitation and trading.
Underemployment is due not so much to lack of work opportunities as to
lack of incentives resulting from relatively low remuneration. This is
the case with tapping of old low-yielding rubber trees. Labor mobility
is high, which helps to reduce intra-regional income differentials. The
only markedly poorer sub-region is that comprising the three southernmost
provinces, where land is relatively scarce.
13.       The main objectives of the rubber replanting program are:  (i)
to increase and maintain the income levels of the lowest 50% income group
through substantially increased rubber yields, and (ii) to ensure that
smallholdings are viable economic units. Recently Government has paid
more attention to the Southern region, partly to integrate the region
fully within the national economy and partly to realize from the
attractive opportunities available in the region for: (i) increasing
incomes of the rural poor by bringing about substantial yield increases
of plantation crops at relatively low costs, e.g. rubber and coconuts;
(ii) for crop diversification, e.g. oil palms; and (iii) for increasing
exports.
14.       At present the relative share of government revenues and
expenditures by regions is as follows:
Region         Expenditures (%)                Revenues
Center                 74                         92
South                   6                          4
North                   9                          2
Northeast              11                          2
Source: Hunting's Technical Services South Thailand
Regional Planning Study 1974.
The share of public investments closely parallel the above pattern. Gov-
ernment continues to give preferential attention to the poorest regions of
the country. However, the Southern region's share of expenditure has risen
by almost 2 percentage points (or by one third) since 1968. Most of the
increase has been concentrated on road building, schools and security. The
emphasis is expected to shift from infrastructure and social expenditures
to agriculture with the initiation and further development of rubber and
coconut replantings.

Source: 1974 RRC Survey.
2.        Rubber areas comprise about 10% of the area under cultivation in
the country. About 90% of the rubber is in Southern Thailand, the balance
being planted in the Southeast, close to the Cambodian border.
3.        Rubber was introduced to Southern Thailand with seedlings brought
from Malaysia by individual farmers. The substantial increase in plantings
in the thirties and from the late forties through the early sixties were due
to favorable prices and, more importantly, to new plantings made by farmers
who migrated in large numbers from the eastern coastal belt to the interior,
where rubber trees were better adapted to prevailing soils and irregular
topography than the traditional crops, e.g. rice and coconuts. Migration
has slowed down more recently as suitable virgin lands became scarce.
0             Development of new land has always been spontaneous.  Since the early
1960's Government has been implementing an expanding program of replant-
ing under the Rubber Replanting Aid Fund Board (Fund).



ANNEX 2
Page  2
4.        In Southern Thailand, rubber is the principal crop grown, covering
more than 50% of the gross agricultural area and representing about 13% of
the GRP 1/ and of rural employment. The prevalence of smallholdings is due
to:
(a)  the absence of a sizeable large landowner class;
(b)  the existence of public virgin lands which have been
cleared and occupied by small spontaneous settlers for
years; and
(c) the advantages of rubber to the smallholder economy.
Rubber is tolerant of a wide range of soils and topography and of low rain-
fall periods. The latex has a high value to weight and is easy to process
into sheets which do not deteriorate under rudimentary storage and transport
conditions. Furthermore rubber trees suffer from few agronomic risks; latex
exploitation and collection provides year round income and is readily orga-
nized by a smallholder family.
5.        Production and Yields.  Production of rubber roughly doubled
between 1966 to 1973 (400,000 mt). By 1981, an estimated 500,000 mt of
rubber will be produced in Thailand, making rubber the second largest
source of export earnings to the country after rice.  Thailand exported
about 380,000 mt in 1973 (or 11% of total world exports), and was the
third largest exporter of natural rubber after Malaysia (50%) and
Indonesia (27%). The three countries provide at present about nine
tenths of total world exports.
6.        Tapping is carried out by rubber tree owners and by tappers on a
share cropping basis. Unimproved trees yield only about 300 kg/ha and the
average tapper harvests only 0.75 kg/day. At prevailing prices this results
in such low incomes for tappers that large areas go untapped at present. The
Fund's replanting program Annex 3, aims at an annual entire replanting target
of 50,000 ha p.a. by 1979. At this rate the area presently under rubber
could be replanted within 30/35 years, which is roughly equivalent to a
tree's economic life. The resulting yields of up to 1,800 kg/ha at full
maturity (six times higher than present averages) would increase net incomes,
and would greatly increase the efficiency of land utilization in roughly one
half of the agricultural area in the South.
7.        Marketing Channels.  Typically, smallholders sell ex-farm unsmoked
sheet or scrap daily to thousands of local traders. The traders sell in
turn to 800/1000 medium size wholesalers who transport the rubber to the
main towns and sell it to a few large processors/exporters. Most of the
exports are made in the form of RSS3 and RSS4 (Table 1).
1/   Fisheries:  13%; rice:  7%; livestock:  3%; coconuts:  1%; trade:  18%;
manufacturing: 8%; services: 7%; mining: 5%; transportation.

8.        Group Marketing Organizations (GMOs).  During the last twenty years,
several programs directed at improving rubber quality and the prices received
for unsmoked sheet, were carried out. In the mid-1950's fourteen co-opera-
tive processing factories were set up to purchase smallholder liquid latex
and process it into high quality RSS. However, these factories were all
closed by the late '50's following difficulties in management. Attempts
were also made to operate smaller, less sophisticated group processing
centers, the Department of Agriculture setting up some twenty-four units.
These also failed and by 1968 only one unit remained in operation. Investi-
gations revealed that farmers received no price advantage by using these
centers and problems of supervision and management led to the decline of
the centers. Eventually, the farmers reverted to using their own simple
pressing, rolling and drying facilities on the farm. Most farmers, where
sufficient care was exercised were, in fact, able to produce clean first
grade unsmoked sheet by air drying of coagulated field latex using their
own unsophisticated processing equipment. Furthermore, all farmers had
access to such equipment. Further investigation revealed that provided
farmers concentrated upon keeping the raw rubber clean on their own farms
(i.e. by maintaining quality) price gains could be obtained by selling in
sufficient bulk quantities. These events led to the establishment during
the last four years of some eighty GMOs which have proven to be very suc-
cessful.
9.        A GMO is based upon a grouping of neighboring farmers with pro-
vision of technical advice and services. The objective is to encourage
farmers to weigh, grade and sell their rubber collectively in bulk to the
middle level buyer and to bypass the first level buyer. The system of
recording is illustrated in Attachment 1. By arranging simultaneous weekly
sales which provide sufficient bulk, members of GMOs have greatly improved
their bargaining position and have enabled the buyer to pay a premium on
account of improved quality, and of bulk sales. Most of the produce of
CMOs can now be graded as RSS 1 or 2 and the farmers have received a price
advantage of about 8%-12%. The emphasis, therefore, has moved decisively
away from Group Processing Centers to GMOs and there is now a need to
greatly increase their number to increase their impact on Thailand's pro-
duction. GMOs are simple to organize and operate and do not require capital
investment. It has been established therefore, on a scale sufficient to
allow a large expansion of the program that selling, farmers can achieve
satisfactory price increases.
10.       The major constraint to the expansion of GMOs is one of available
technical advisory staff. An important component of the project would be
staff training for this purpose (Annex 3, Appendix 3). There are no tech-
nical problems related to processing of smallholder latex into unsmoked
sheet.



ANNEX 2
Page  4
11.       The method of setting up GMOs is well established and fully de-
scribed by the RRC 1/. Experience has demonstrated that regular follow-up
supervision and advice is essential to the continuing viability of these
organizations. With adequate follow up there has been a 92Z survival rate
of the GMOs set up in the last few years. There are currently some 80 GMOs,
which at maximum capacity of 15 tons/GHO/year, should be able to sell about
1,000 tons of wet sheet per year. A reasonable objective during the course
of the project would be to expand the number of GMOs by about 400, with
a throughput of 8,000 tons of wet sheet per year.
12.       Block Rubber.  Compared with Malaysia and Indonesia, the intro-
duction of block rubber to Thailand has been slow, but there are now firm
intentions on the part of rubber processors to set up sufficient block
rubber capacity to handle most of Thailand's production by the early
1980's. The major concern will be to investigate how best the success-
ful and expanding GMO program can be incorporated into this move towards
increasing block rubber production, a question of considerable importance,
since coagulum in the form of wet sheet is not, at the moment, the most
suitable form or raw material for the block rubber process. However, wet
sheet production (unsmoked sheet) is a long established and traditional
form of primary processing in Thailand and with this in mind, the Rubber
Research Center is rightly concentrating upon investigation into the prac-
ticability of conversion of unsmoked sheet into block rubber.  The most
suitable form oof raw material is liquid latex but the collection of this
product in sufficient volume and in satisfactory condition would not be
practical. A possible alternative to wet sheet is the assembly at fixed
centers, of field latex and the transportation of coagulated latex to the
block rubber factories within 24 hours. However, present crop volume may
render this alternative impractical also. It is important that this ques-
tion be economically resolved so that the block rubber producers utilize
an ex farm product which can be readily produced by the smallholder.
13.       Institutional Support for the Rubber Industry.  Unlike the
other major producing countries, rubber cultivation, processing and market-
ing up to the point of export, lie within the jurisdiction of the Ministry
of Agriculture. The Rubber Division and the Fund participate fully in the
several international organizations which represent the interests of the
natural rubber producing countries. In particular the RRC Co-ordinates
its research with that of the other major rubber research centers in
Malaysia and Indonesia. Details relating to the Fund and RRC are given in
Annexes 3 and 4 respectively. The functions of other institutions in the
rubber industry are outlined below.
14.       The Rubber Division of the Department of Agriculture.  The Divi-
sion has long held the responsibility of implementing (now shared with the
Fund) regulating rubber cultivation, licensing dealers, recording statistics,

and operating rubber stations in most of the rubber growing provinces. The
Division's rubber stations have acted as foci of extension for the rubber
farmers, and as sources of improved planting material.
15.       The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE).  There is a
DAES Rubber Officer in each rubber-producing province. He supplies the
Rubber Division with the statistical information required relating to
rubber planting, production and export. Most of the DAES officers posted
to the rubber-producing provinces have been trained in specialized rubber
topics at RRC. However, as their multiple responsibilities and small staff
do not allow them to perform rubber extension duties adequately, this respon-
sibility will be the Fund's exclusively in future, up to and including the
second year of tapping. DAES staff will continue: to provide extension
services from the third year of tapping onwards; to identify potential re-
planters; and to advise rubber growers on general agricultural practices.
16.       The Government Rubber Estates Organization.  The Organization
operates a substantial area of a former commercial rubber estate acquired
by Goverment during the thirties in Nakhon Sri Thammarat and subsequently
expanded. In addition to operating the estate and its processing factory,
the Organization contracts to provide the Fund with an extremely large
number of budded stumps for supply to replanters. It has what is cer-
tainly the largest rubber nursery in the world, where about 1,000 people
are employed as budders and field labour in producing about 14 million
budded stumps annually. Additional requirements of about 2 million
budded stumps are sub-contracted. The Fund is scheduled to manage this
nursery in future so as to better coordinate production of planting mate-
rial with rubber replanting.

THAILAND
RUBBER REPLANTING PROJECT
THE RUBBER REPLANTING AID FUND        (THE FUND)
A. General
1.        The Fund was established by an Act in 1960 (Appendix 1) as an
independent statutory body responsible for assisting the replanting of old
rubber. The Fund receives 95% of the proceeds of a rubber replanting cess
of about 0.5 /Kg of rubber levied at the point of export (see Section 5
of the Act). From this revenue the Fund administers replanting grants to
individual replanters, and also supervises the maintenance of plantings
through the immature period of the trees (Table 1).
2.        The Fund enjoys day-to-day operational autonomy under the over-
all supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC).
The Act contains the Fund's basic legal and organizational structure and
allows a wide latitude in day-to-day operations, operating procedures,
and the allocation of management responsibilities.
B. Organization and Staffing
3.        The Board's chairman is the Minister of MOAC.  Board members com-
prise five representatives of MOAC, and one representative each of the Min-
istry of the Interior, Customs Department, National Economic and Social
Development Board, Commerce Department, Budget Bureau and farmers, as well
as the Fund's Director and two members at large. Board members are appointed
by the Council of Ministers for two-year terms, and can be reappointed. Quo-
rum and decisions are reached with the attendance and vote of a simple major-
ity of Board members, respectively.
4.        The Board:
(a) sets policy;
(b) approves annual programs and budgets;
(c) determines the amounts of grants and the terms
and conditions of grant payments;
(d)  oversees the Fund's activities; and
(e) approves structural and procedural changes.



ANNEX 3
Page  2
5.        The Director is appointed by the Chairman with the approval of the
Council of Ministers. He has traditionally exerted his powers fully. The
Director represents the Fund in dealings with third parties.  He may dele-
gate any of his duties to individual subordinates with the Board's approval.
The present Director is a highly capable and experienced administrator with
a solid technical knowledge of rubber. The Deputy Director assists the
Director with day-to-day management of the Fund's operations and substi-
tutes for the Director in his absence.
6.        Overall Organization.  The Fund's existing organizational structure
is shown in Appendix 2 and the proposed new organization structure in
Appendix 3. The organizational changes would result in the creation of a
Development Division at headquarters which would be responsible for the
overall support of field operations, including farmer ethrel stimulation,
training, intercropping, demonstration plots, nursery management, and group
marketing of rubber.
7.        The responsibilities of the other headquarters' divisions would
remain largely as at present, as follows: Secretary's, in charge of legal
and personnel duties; Finance, responsible for all financial transactions
including, cess collection and the administration of grants; Inspectors,
who act as internal supervisors of the Provincial Offices; and Replanting,
which processes grant applications and submits them to the Board for ap-
proval (Replanting Consideration Section); checks all land survey data and
considers requests for adjustments of replanting areas (Survey Section);
analyses field standards and evaluates progress of operations (Verification
and Assessment Section); keeps files of individual grants and issues indi-
vidual farmer identification cards and booklets (Filing Section) and is
responsible for computer activities, which up to now have been limited to
the processing of grants (Computer Section).
8.        The proposed organization structure is basically adequate for
present and expected needs of the Fund. The mission recommends:
(a)  creating an additional deputy-director post with
overall responsibility; placing all field opera-
tions (Replanting and Development Divisions as
well as the Provincial Offices) under one deputy-
director, and Finance/Administration under the
other.
(b) making the Computer Section (now under the
Replanting Division) an independent unit under
the Director as its operations are extended in
future to cover also financial transactions and
inventory controls.
9.        Staffing, Recruitment and Training.  Fund staff numbered 1,151
at the end of calendar 1974 and was distributed as follows:

/a   Includes 17 office chiefs, 117 field surveyors, 466 field supervisors,
and 34 accountants and bookkeepers.
Of the 466 field supervisors, about 20% were agronomist and 80% graduates of
agricultural vocational schools.' The present size and distribution of head-
quarters and field staff are adequate to undertake the expanded volume of
operations from 1976 through 1979 with the additions and improvements recom-
mended under the project. Fund staff are recruited on the basis of merit.
The quality of the field staff is adequate. A number of rubber smallholders'
sons could be recruited and trained in the simplest extension tasks, such as
supervision of plantings from the second through the fifth year; and in
budding and tapping techniques for further farmer training. Their employment
would make supervision more acceptable in areas where outsiders are not
welcome.
10.       In 1974 the Fund conducted two types of training programs:
(a)  for new staff:       (i)  general training in rubber growing at
the rate of 20 staff for one month
courses each year;
(ii) short specialized courses, such as (a)
high level tapping (67 staff, given one
week's training); (b) budding (5 staff,
given one week's training; and (c) crown
budding (30 staff, given one week's
training); and
(b)  for replanters:           one-week sessions on tapping, sheet
making and marketing given to 2,500
farmers out of 6,000 eligible; field
budding: one-week sessions given to



ANNEX 3
Page 4
817 out of 3,000 eligible replanters;
high level tapping with ethrel applica-
tion given to 200 farmers. Training is
conducted by the staff of RRC (Annex 4).
11.       Staff Remuneration.  Fund basic salary categories compare roughly
with those of the civil service (Appendix 5) but Fund staff do not pay in-
come taxes, which amount to 10% of salaries. Other Fund staff compensations
and benefits amount to 30% of basic salaries. Field staff receive hardship
allowances of up to 25% of basic salaries. There is no question that Fund
remuneration levels, and the flexibility provided by the Fund for promotions
and transfers have been important factors in attracting high quality graduate
staff to the Fund.
C. Policies and Procedures
12.       The Fund's basic objective is to undertake replantings of new
rubber to replace over-aged trees throughout Thailand. To this end, the
Fund collects a cess levied on rubber exports and uses the proceeds to
finance the cost of replanting in the form of grants to individual re-
planters (para 1).  By law the Fund must strive to allocate annually
0            about 70% of its available funds to smallholdings, which are legally
defined as having up to 8 ha each. (Appendix 1, Sections 3 and 19.)
13.       To qualify, rubber farmers need to:
(a) have over-aged rubber trees at a minimum density of
25 trees per rai (160 trees/ha);
(b) have appropriate soils, topography and climatic
conditions for rubber tree growing; and
(c) have clear rights to the trees and their produce,
as ascertained from neighbors and the village
headman.
14.       Fund extension agents visit would-be-replanters and after ascer-
taining that they would qualify for grants, help them fill application
forms (Attachment 1). Survey teams organized on the basis of three per day
(100 days p.a.), visit the location and prepare fairly detailed reports
(Attachment 2), including preliminary plotting of the areas to be replanted.
Copies of the reports, including the surveyor's recommendations, are sent
to the Replanting Consideration Section (Replanting Division) in Bangkok.
These are subsequently submitted for approval by the Board and sent back
to the Replanting Division for further processing through the Computer
Unit and filing in the Registration Section.
.



ANNEX 3
Page  5
15.       Next the headquarters' approval and the definitive plot surveys,
are sent back to provincial offices. Provincial officers convene meetings
of planters to give:
(a) an explanation of thc rights and responsibilities
of replanters;
(b) individual booklets cc.ltaining schedules of input
applications, of supervision by Fund staff, and of
grant cash and in-kind releases; and
(c) vouchers for picking up the first batch of material
inputs (mostly fertilisers and herbicides) at village
warehouses according to the application schedules.
Payments in cash are made to replanters every 10 days
at provincial headquarters to cover part of the labor
expenses incurred (the balance is contributed free by
replanters as family labor).
16.       Field supervision visits are made by Fund staff at the time of
completion of land clearing, planting and cover crop establishment and
at regular 3-4 month intervals thereafter during the 6-year period of
immaturity.  The approval of field inspectors is required for each phase
before the following tranche of disbursements is authorized.  When field
standards practised by replanters are not satisfactory they are given the
necessary help (if warranted) and a prudent time period to improve them
prior to a second inspection. A field inspector makes about four visits
per day and handles a total of 300 holdings p.a. Field staff are provided
with motorbicycles and this, together with the availability of a good trunk
and feeder road network in Southern Thailand, facilitates surveys and peri-
odic inspections.
17.       The above procedures are deemed essentially satisfactory.  The
Fund, however, could increase substantially its workload if needed by more
evenly distributing its business throughout the year.
D. Financial Position and Procedures
18.       Sources of Funds.  RRAFB has three sources of funds:  the replant-
ing cess; interest income on deposits and government subventions. Revenue
from the replanting cess passes directly to the Fund. By law, 90% of cess
revenue is to be used for grant payments, 5% is set aside for administrative
expenses and 5% is passed on to the Rubber Research Center.
19.       The separation of administrative costs from grant payments is
sound financial practice, and while the present allocation of RRAFB's cess
revenue between administrative expenditures (5%) and grant payments (90%)
is necessarily arbitrary, no change is envisioned.



ANNEX 3
Page  6
20.       Cash Position and Fund Structure.  In the past, financial constraints
have not limited RRAFB's operations; on the contrary, it has been able to accu-
mulate substantial reserves. The five main funds, and the main transactions
between these funds, are shown in Table 2. Combined cash reserves in these
funds are estimated at 599 million Baht (US$30 million).
21.       Due to the rapid accumulation of cash balances during the build
up period of the replanting program, interest income has been substantial.
The Act (Section 18) specifies that interest income is to cover administra-
tive expenses over and above the 5% allocation of cess revenues, and that
remaining balances are to be reallocated to the Replanting Fund. The law
also states that the Government is to provide for additional operational
expenses of RRAFB "as may be deemed necessary." This last phase is am-
biguous, as in practice it has not meant the financing of administrative
expenses over and above the 5% allocation from cess revenues plus the in-
come from interest. The cash flow of Table 2 shows that interest income
would have been more than sufficient to cover the shortfall of the admin-
istrative 5% provision of the cess from actual administrative expenses.
Nevertheless, the Government has contributed subventions to administra-
tive expenditures totalling Baht 100 million between 1969 and 1974.
22.       Substantial reserves from interest income have been allowed to be
put into three reserve funds (Land and Buildings Fund, the Subsidiary Fund
and the Unallocated Interest Reserve) in the administrative budget whose
cash balances now amount to about Baht 174 million. Total allocations
from interest income to the replanting fund proper have only amounted
Baht 50 million. There is no apparent rationale for the allocations of
interest income to these various funds as they have taken place, or to
the "transactions" between these funds. A rational fund structure is
required to define the Government's commitment to the financing of future
deficits, both for administrative expenses and for the replanting proper.
The management consultants terms of reference would include the rationali-
zation of the Fund's statement.
23.       The Subsidiary Fund.  Table 3 shows grant payments to farmers in
cash and kind (see Para 3.03). In addition to these grant payments from
the Replanting Fund proper, certain other cost of on-farm development,
which are not nominally part of the grant but are equally real benefits
to the farmer, are financed from the Subsidiary Fund as part of the admin-
istrative budget. 1974 and budgeted 1975 expenditures from the Subsidiary
Fund are shown in Table 4. It appears that the Subsidiary Fund serves as
a catchall for expenditures which could neither be classified as strictly
administrative costs or were thought to be part of the grant. However,
the inclusion of replanting costs benefits into administrative costs and
the accumulation of substantial reserves in the same fund have contributed
to the illusionary inflation of administrative deficits for which govern-
ment subventions have been obtained. With the increasing diversity of the
Funds activities and the need for a clear definition of the Government's
commitment to finance deficits (Para 4.16) this procedure will no longer
be satisfactory.  The Subsidiary Fund could be absorbed by other funds as
follows:



ANNEX 3
Page  7
24.       The Transport and Handling cost of materials which account for
most of the expenditures from the Subsidiary Fund, are in fact standard
components of the grant, and there is no reason why the accounting of
these costs should be considered and administrative cost rather than a
part of grant payments.
25.       The Fund has recently taken over Nursery Production from the Rubber
Division (Para 4.06); hence it will no longer pay the service charges to the
Government nurseries. Because of their importance and because they would
be the Fund's only production enterprise, nurseries would remain an inde-
pendent accounting unit. Consistent with the required separation admin-
istrative costs and grant payments, the mission recommends that the nur-
series should supply the planting materials at direct cost to the replant-
ing program, and that overhead costs be accounted as administrative expenses.
Details of the enlarged nursery requirements, costs needed and schedules of
nursery activities are given in Annex 10, Appendices 1 to 3.
26.       The development of Extension Services are properly part of admin-
istrative expenses and there is no need to separate the associated costs in
the Subsidiary Fund.
27.       Financial Administration of On Farm Development Costs.  Paras 5.04
and 5.05 describe the RRAFB's procedures in the administration of replanting
grants to farmers.  This section deals with the financial aspects of the
individual grant payments and recommended changes in their administration.
28.       The replanting grant has the dual objective of providing suffi-
cient material inputs (mainly fertilizer) to reap the full benefits of
improved rubber technology, and of contributing to the subsistence of
farmers during the period of maturation, by financing part of labor costs.
Accordingly the grant consists of material components which are delivered
to the farmer in kind, as well as cash payments. Both are received in
installments over a period of about 5-1/2 years, as shown in Attachment 4.
29.       The amount of the grant is determined by the Board of RRAFB.  In
an effort to keep up with rising costs, the Fund raised the grant from an
initial level of 1500 Baht/rai from 1961 to 1966 to 1850 Baht/rai in 1966-
67 and finally to 2000 Baht/rai since 1968. However, these '7authorized"
amounts do not necessarily represent the actual cost of the grant since
material components of the grant are fixed in terms of quantities rather
than in terms of money. The rapid rise of compound fertilizer prices by
about 140% between 1974 and 1975 resulted in an increase of about 900
Baht in actual cost grant. While due to the unavailability of fertilizer
during the past year this has not yet resulted in a corresponding increase
in the rate of disbursements, the replanters remain entitled to the delivery
of fertilizer in the amounts approved by the Board.
30.       The proposed increase of grant to about Baht 3000 rai takes into
accuunt  changes in prices as well as recommended adjustments in material
iaputs is agreed upon between the Fund, RRC and the mission.  The cash
component of tne grant is retained at the previous level.



ANNEX 3
Page 8
31.       On farm development costs under the program would either be
standard items financed by the grant, or non-standard items financed by
the individual farmers.
32.       The proposed level of material components included in the grant
cover the standard required amounts for replanting. If a farmer needs more
of certain materials e.g. fertilizer or herbicides, he can get these from
the local merchant and his extra purchases are deducted from the cash com-
ponent of the grant. Conversely, if he uses less than the standard amounts
of materials (other than fertilizers), his account is credited and he re-
ceives the cash equivalent together with his last installment.
33.       Under this arrangement, which has its merits, it is clearly de-
sirable to keep the number of material inputs at a minimum. The material
inputs should be strictly confined to the required amounts in order to
minimize the misuse of the grants by farmers.
34.       The proposed broadening of the Fund's scope of activity under
the newly created Development Division would also increase the number of
material inputs procured by the Fund. These would principally include
ethyrl (for HLT before felling), seeds for intercrops (including improved
rice seeds), and fertilizers for intercrops.  As the grant only provides
for the replanting of rubber, no allowances would be made to include items
not directly required by rubber replanting into the grant. Moreover, as
only a minority of the farmers are expected to engage in HLT and inter-
cropping, it would not be advisable to prescribe standard amounts of such
materials to farmers. However, as part of the RRAFB's extension activity,
RRAFB proposes to make such materials available to farmers.  Ethryl is already
sold to farmers on short term credit and similar provisions would be made for
inputs for intercropping. These materials would be available by local mer-
chant for purchase by the farmer. If the sale of such items would be sub-
sidized, the Government would finance these subsidies.

distribute the balance of additional aid to the other types of
plantations. In this case, the rate of aid contribution specified
above shall not apply.
Owners of the same type of rubber plantations may receive unequal
aid or may receive it at different times or may not receive it at all.
For this purpose, the Board shall allocate according to the amount of
aid contribution available and to take into account the mutual benefit
to be derived from the increased yield from rubber trees.
The fact that any rubber plantation owner has not received aid
under the preceding paragraph shall not deprive him of the right to
receive it in the following years.
Section 20.
Any rubber plantation owner who wishes to apply for aid under this Act
shall make an application to the RRAFB Official of the locality where
the rubber plantations are situated in accordance with the forms and
procedure prescribed in a Ministerial Regulation.
In the case where ,an applicant for aid is a rubber planter on
leased land or on land belonging to someone else, the applicant must
satisfy the RRAFB Official that the lessor or owner of the land had
given approval for the application for aid.
For the purpose of examination in the granting of aid by the
Board, the aid recipient must provide such facilities and comply with
such orders of the Board or its Officials as may be necessary.
Section 21.
An owner of a rubber plantation of not more than 15 Rai may apply for
aid to cultivate a new plantation of a size more than 15 Rai with good
quality rubber trees. In such case, the application shall be regarded
as application for aid to replanting under this Act but the amount of
aid receivable shall be the same as that receivable for the plantation
already in existence.
Section 22.
If a rubber plantation owner receiving aid under this Act does not comply
with or violates a Ministerial Regulation, rule, regulation or order of
the Board or its Official under this Act, the Board has the power to

THAILAND
RUBBER REPLANTING PROJECT
Assumptions for Incremental Manpower Needs of the Fund
A. Fund Replanting and Field Maintenance Activities
1.        These are divided into two main categories:  (a) new replantings
(160,000 ha) executed during 1976-79; and (b) continuation of development
on existing replantings made prior to 1976 (about 120,000 ha) and of new
replanting carried out during 1976-78 (Table 1 and para 4.05 of text.)
B.   Land Surveys
2.        Surveys are conducted one year before replantings on the basis
of one survey per day (100 days p.a.) by one surveyor and an assistant.
With improved efficiency, the survey rate could be doubled and 180 days
p.a. spent surveying.  By 1979 manpower requirements would be as follows:
Table 2: SURVEYS
1975     1976      1977     1978      1979
Number of holdings ('000)      12.0      12.5     17.5      25.0     25.0
Surveys p.a. per team         120       150      220       300      360
Surveyors                     117       117      117        83       70
Annual change                  -        -        -         (34)      (13)
With the proposed improvement in utilization of existing survey staff, there
would be no need to recruit additional surveyors and, from 1978 onwards,
fewer would be required.
C.   Field Supervision
3.        An increase in the number of field inspectors would be made on the
basis of existing averages during the first project year, e.g. each inspec-
tor would visit each holding four times a year and would make three visits
per day, 200 days p.a. for a total of 150 holdings p.a., increasing pro-
gressively thereafter with improvements in organization.

/a   includes new replantings and replantings made prior to 1976
through the full immature period.
/b   includes 30 front-line supervisors.
About 75% of the recruits for field inspection would be vocational school
graduates earning $ 2,500 per month in basic salary, plus 50% of this in
other remuneration and benefits, amounting to $ 45,000 per man p.a. Field
clerks would be required on the basis of one clerk per two iinspectors.
Total remuneration would be $ 30,000 per clerk p.a.
D.   Training
5.        The Basic Program for new Fund Staff would be expanded from one to
thret iionths and would include the curricula of the existing shorter, spe-
cialized courses, e.g. budding, high level tapping. Instructors (agronomy
platht pathology and processing) would continue to be RRC and Fund staff on
a part-time basis, teaching one course per year through 1977. They would
teach full time beginning in 1978, when two groups of 45 students each p.a.
would be handled. Instructors would also handle shorter specialized and
refresher courses for older staff. Training would be transferred from the
RRC at Hat Yai to the MOAC agricultural station at Kanthuli, (which has a
larger field area). Assurances would be obtained during negotiations that
the MOAC facilities at Kanthuli would be made available to the Fund, within
three months of signing the loan agreement. Additional investments in hous-
ing during 1975 are estimated at R 150,000. No incremental costs would be
incurred under the project.
6.        The Complete Replanters(tapping, sheet making, basic marketing)
course would be continued at the centers in Yala, Hat Yai and Wang Tang,
and started at Phang Nga in 1975. Under the project, however, strong
oxnphasis would be placed on sending instructors to tihe villages in order
to reaclh :.cre replanters and to reduce costs (e.g. student per diems and
transportation). Each instructor, as at present, would teach groups of
10 replanters in one-week courses during 40 weeks p.a. for an average of
one instructor per 400 replanters p.a.  About one-fourth of eligible re-
planters would be trained as at present, each of these in turn would train
3 others. Future requirements of instructors would be as follows:

Total remuneration of instructors would be t 45,000 per instructor p.a.
7.        Field Budding.  The Fund will carry on with budded stump and
field budding programs. Training will be given as at present e.g. one
budder per 5 trainees in one-week courses for 15 weeks, p.a. for a total
of 75 trainees per instructor. A progressively diminishing percentage of
eligible replanters would be trained by the Fund, since further training
of new replanters, (for a fee) by previous trainees, who have received
their Fund approval certificates, would take up a progressively larger
share of the total, as shown below.

Training would be given at Fund-controlled nurseries in Phuket, Krabi and
Songkhla, but also in private nurseries to be established. Total remunera-
tion would be i 45,000 per instructor p.a.
8.        High Level Tapping and Yield Stimulation.  Typically replantings
are made in one half to two-thirds of the individual rubber plot areas,
leaving a balance of old rubber trees to maintain a source of ready cash,
albeit substantially reduced, to the smallholders during the immature
period of the new rubber. High level tapping (HLT), together with ethrel
stimulation on the trees to be felled and on old trees, would increase
S           yields and incomes in a critical phase for smallholder families.  The



ANNEX 3
Appendix 4
Page 4
Fund vill continue to train smallholders in these techniques and after a
transition period, would provide the training beginning in 1977 for 3
years of high level tapping and stimulation program to be carried out
(instead of one year as at present) prior to land clearing. Each
instructor can train and supervise groups of 30 smallholders for 3
months, 3 times a year. Those trained represent about 15% of the
would-be replanters and each in turn would train on average, seven
other smallholders. The manpower requirements would be as follows:

Accumulated                          8       43       41       21
The Fund would have 40 available staff for this training component, which
would fill part of the annual requirements up to 1979.  The balance of
manpower needed would be allocated temporarily from other act'vities, and
therefore, no incremental manpower would be hired. Ethrel would be pro-
vided at cost by the Fund on the basis of a short term revolving fund
mechanism, following the technical specifications of Annex 10, Appendix 2.
9.        Group Marketing Organizations.  The Fund would expand its train-
ing and support activities for GKOs consisting of small groupings of neigh-
bouring replanters who are taught how to follow daily rubber prices, make
clean, thin and uniform rubber sheet, and bargain for the sale of their
output. These have resulted in 8 to 12% producer price increases (Annex 2).
Manpower requirements would be as follows on the basis of GMOs producing
15 mt p.a. and comprising from 5 to 10 farmers each:

Management Consultants
Terms of Reference
A.        Background.  The Fund's organization and procedures are basically
adequate but have evolved without the benefit of external evaluation. With
the proposed expansion of Fund operations, a review of the Fund is needed
to enable it to correct present or possible future weaknesses to ensure
that it can bear the burden of its increased responsibilities through 1979.
Accordingly the services of management consultants are required to review
the present organization and to make recommendations for the future.
B.        Terms of Reference.  The management consultants would:-
(1) conduct a detailed teview of the present Fund management
structure, of its manpower resources and operating
procedures;
(2) formulate detailed recommendations for an effective
organizational and management structure; for staffing
requirements; and for the organization of operations.
The detailed recommendations would include the
management information systems necessary for the
successful execution of the Fund's activities, such
as budgetary, accounting, annual financial planning
and control, inventory control, internal audit,
program control and reporting systems;
(3) assist the Fund in developing methods of planning and
Implementation of major agricultural activities i.e.
work method analysis of nursery operations, clearing
of old rubber, planting of rubber seed/stumps, inter-
cropping, field maintenance and crop harvesting;
(4) assist the Fund with the design of staff training and
career development programs in relation to the needs of
the expanded replanting targets;
(5)  make recommendations as to the operating methods of a
0                    new monitoring and evaluation unit to be set up within
the Fund, but independent of the operating divisions.
This unit would:



ANNEX 3
Appendix 6
Page 2
(i) Coordinate its technical inspection with the
financial inspection by the internal audit
and accounts divisions; and
(ii) Analyze the activities of the Fund to identify
any uneconomic operating, agricultural, processing
or marketing practices.
(6) assist in the implementation of those recommendations
under (2) and (5) above which are agreed by the Fund
and the Bank.
C.   1.   Criteria for Consideration in Formulating Recommendations.  The
management structure and organization proposed must be appropriate to the
expanding program. Any necessary modifications in the present structure
and organization would be implemented at a pace which would allow for
successful execution. It should be appreciated that reorganization is
an evolving process related to the continually changing demands of the
situation.
2.        There would be varying degrees of centralization depending upon
the needs for economies of scale in activities such as planning, procure-
ment, personnel training and services on the one hand and the need for
rapid and effective action in field operations at provincial level on the
other.
3.        The management structure, responsibilities and procedures should
have sufficient precision so that accountability is clearly defined, with-
out losing basic flexibility to permit speedy implementation where necessary.
D.   1.   Consultant Staff Requirements.  The management consultants would
be a three-man-team. The Team Leader would be responsible for overall man-
agement, organizational structure and operating procedures. A Financial
Analyst would introduce the required changes in the structure of accounting
practices and set up an internal audit unit. A computer specialist would
propose and implement recommendations regarding the computerization of
selected accounting and administrative operations. He would also delineate
the future role of computer services in the organization.
2.        The consultancy would be in two phases:  (i) review and formula-
tion of recommendations, and (ii) implementation. The initial period would
be for six months and the subsequent implementation would take one year.
The total period of both phases would be about 55 man months. Some 12
months after completion of implementation, consultants would re-visit Fund
Headquarters for about 3 weeks to review progress and assist in any further
streamlining of Fund procedures.



ANNEX 3
Appendix 6
Page 3
E.        Fund Participation.  The Fund's management would give its full
support to the consultants and all Fund and UNDP/FAO staff directly concerned
would participate actively in this endeavor.
F.        Timing.  The Consultants would commence field work within six months
of signing of the loan agreement.

Guidelines for the External Auditing of the Fund
1.        The Auditors are to submit both form and long form reports.
2.        These reports should be addressed to the Board.
3.        The audit would be carried out in conformity with generally
accepted auditing standards which include, in addition to adherence to
accounting principles which are generally accepted, standards of preparation,
standards of field and office records, standards of supervision, review, re-
porting and disclosure. In case generally accepted standards could not be
followed, the auditors should expressly state so, indicating specifically
the circumstances.
4.        Verification of assets and liabilities should cover:
(a) cash and bank balances
(b) replanting materials, stocks and other inventories
(c) provident fund loans (receivable) and other receivables
(d) fixed assets - buildings, equipment, vehicles, etc.
(e) provident and pension fund liabilities
(f) creditors
(g) other assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities.
Verification should include physical examination and test checks; examina-
tion of records and expenditure; obtaining of certificates independently
from banks and other custodians of assets, contractors, suppliers, debtors
and creditors; ascertaining that the Fund is being administered according
to its rules. Particular attention should be paid to the implementation
of Section 19 of the Rubber Replanting Aid Fund Act of 1960 and of Section
18 of the 1962 Amendments to the Act.
5.        The short form report refers to the normal audit certificate given
by the Auditors at the end of each audit.

0                                                                        Appendix 7
Page 2
6.        If a qualified opinion is given by the auditors, the certificate
or report should be modified in such a manner to clarify the nature of the
qualification. Reference should be made specifically to the subject of
the qualification and of the effect on the financial position and results
of operation, if reasonably determinable.
7.        The long form report is an extension of the short form report.
Appropriate details (analyses, summaries, explanations and comments) of
items in the various certified financial statements should be included in
the long form report.
8.        Certified statements would include:
(a) a balance sheet for the Fund;
(b) income and expenditure account for the Fund;
(c) income and expenditure accounts for each activity of the Fund;
(d) fixed assets showing additions, disposals, depreciation and
balance sheet values;
(e) non-recurring expenses;
(f) miscellaneous income and expenditure;
(g) age classification of debtors and creditors;
(h) details of payments in advance to suppliers with comments on
the basis of payment and verification that the Services have
been performed subsequently. Arrears of loan repayments
(including interest);
(i) adequacy of pension and provident fund balances;
(j) sources and application of funds.
Statements should, where practicable, show comparative figures for the
preceding year.
9.        Comments and recommendations in the long form report would
include:
(a) implementation of recommendation by the state auditors
in the previous year;
*               (b)  management and organization;
(c) budgetary control;



ANNEX 3
Appendix 7

THAILAND
RUBBER REPLANTING PROJECT
The Rubber Research Center
1.        The RRC was founded in 1965 and today employs more than 60
professional staff. RRC's budget (US$0.75 million in 1974) is derived
from 5% of the rubber cess proceeds and from MOAC budget allocations.
Since 1965 a rubber development project, jointly sponsored by the Govern-
ment and UNDP and operated by the Rubber Division and FAO, has helped
develop RRC activities and facilities at Hat Yai, to service the Thai
industry. The RRC was originally intended to undertake research in both
agricultural and technological aspects, to develop research findings for
use by the industry and to provide a comprehensive extension service to
disseminate available know-how to producers and processors of rubber. The
first two objectives are being actively pursued and the third has been
diminished in relative importance by a policy decision in 1968 which placed
responsibility for all agricultural extension under the MOAC's Department
of Agricultural Extension Services (DAES).  The different areas of res-
ponsibility have now been defined and are described in Annex 2.
2.        In line with the recommendations of the mid-term review mission
of the rubber development project. The RRC in future will be involved with
extension liaison and only to a diminishing extent in providing field exten-
sion service to growers, as the Fund and DAES will assume this responsibility.
Having developed promising research advances, and tested these by experi-
mentation, their most important function will then be to demonstrate the
innovations in the field in key areas of Thailand. Successful innovations
will then be disseminated to farmer level by the Fund and DAE.
3.        The RRC has:
(a) provided training courses and refresher courses for
officers of the DAE and the Fund.
(b) on behalf of the Fund, provided training courses for
farmers who have completed replanting; and
(c) supervised the supply of planting material. This entails
regular inspection and licensing of all official and
commercial nurseries that provide budwood or budded
stumps for planting by Thai rubber growers; not only
does the RRC ensure that the material is true to label,
it also advises on future trends in the breeding and
0                     selection program so that timely supplies of planting
material are made.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
4.        The RRC also investigates rubber processing and other technological
problems, and advises rubber processors as necessary. It acts as the
national regulatory body for the Thai Tested Rubber (TTR) Scheme, provides
analytical services for rubber specification testing, and supervises testing
laboratories operated privately by industry.
5.        Priorities for Future Research.  The main priorities should be the
following:
(1) research into methods leading to reduction of the
immature non-productive period;
(2) research into increasing yields; and
(3) research into reduction of operating costs.
6.        The following principle should be emphasized in planning research
programs for Thailand. The majority of Thai rubber is grown by small farmers
and research should be directed towards the needs of these farmers, in par-
ticular, their requirement for income during the immature phase. New tech-
niques should be such that their application on the small farm is simple
and effective.  A further important principle arises from the ecological
conditions in Southern Thailand being fairly similar to those of northern            0
peninsular Malaysia. Many of the practices used in Malaysia can be directly
introduced into Thailand reducing the scope of the research effort at the
present time when availability of experienced staff is limited and allowing
concentration on the major priorities.
7.        Spheres of Applied Research.  The spheres of applied research
which should be given priority are: (a) breeding and selection; (b)
Agronomy; and (c) Processing.
8.        Breeding and Selection.  The main clones in use in Thailand were
bred and selected in Indonesia and in Malaysia. There is a need for a much
greater effort in testing the wide range of clones which have been produced
in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Cambodia. During 1970/71,
the RRC established some 12 ha of clone trials, but since that time there
has been no further planting of such trials. This program, therefore, is
considerably in arrears and should be given highest priority in the future.
9.        Field Planting.  Further research is needed to investigate tthe
agronomic and economic advantages of different types of planting material
under Thai conditions. Experiments and investigations should center on
the use of polybag planting material of a wide range of ages; 7 to 8 month
old budded stumps; 12 to 18 month old budded stumps; and large stump bud-
dings produced by the well-known Craigielea technique. RRC plans to in-
vestigate the use of small stump buddings cut back at about one meter
height.  This fairly advanced material is about 12 months old after the
budding stage, travels well and has been used successfully in Cambodia.
Research should also be conducted into various methods of field budding.
A particular investigation which the RRC intends to carry out is to compare



ANNEX 4
Page  3
the budding of seedling stumps planted in the field, with the budding of
seed at stake and with budded stumps.
10.       Crown Budding.  There is an urgent need for a large crown budding
trial, this being most important in relation to the need in future to grow
high yielding trunks with Phytopthora tolerant or resistant crowns.
11.       Inter-Cropping.  Inter-cropping investigations are required during
the first three years of rubber growth and should center on:
(i) effects of inter-cropping on the growth and yield of
rubber;
(ii) the inter-cropping fertilizer requirements;
(iii) management and labor requirements;
(iv) economics and marketing of inter-crops.
12.       Exploitation.  Research into tapping and yield stimulation should
concentrate upon appropriate reduction of tapping intensity (i.e., length
*     of tapping cut) and frequency, so that where possible, a family can tap its
own rubber.  In conjunction with these experiments on tapping systems, there
should be trials of yield stimulation of rubber at all ages.
13.       Nutrition.  Fertilizer recommendations are presently largely based
on experience in Malaysia which is understandable, in view of the very long
term nature of such experimentation. However, the RRC has a very well
equipped analytical laboratory and there is need for considerable expan-
sion of the present relatively modest program of field experiments.
14.       Pathology.  Research should continue on Phytopthora botryosa leaf
disease, the principal approach being the testing of suitable three part
tree combinations and on Phytophthora black stripe panel disease. Research
into the latter disease and other panel diseases should consist of investiga-
tion into the cost effectiveness and application techniques of the range of
chemicals available. In view of the low incidence of Rigidoporus lignosus
(white root disease), research into inexpensive and effective prevention
and control techniques is essential.
15.       Processing.  As production of good quality wet sheet is a well-
established tradition, research should concentrate upon development of
economic methods of converting this product into block rubber.
16.       Staffing of the RRC.  Successful execution of the applied research
programs outlined above is essential to the provision of a modern technolog-
ical base for a high yielding, rapidly expanding rubber industry. The con-
*      tinuation of the present UNDP/FAO support for the RRC is considered vital
during the remainder of the 1970's.

RUBBER REPTAN 7ING PROJECT
Fiscal Implications of the Project
1. *This Annex examines the fiscal implications of accelerating the
replanting program to a rate of 50,000 ha per year, from the present
level of 20,000 ha per year. Table 1 projects resource transfer from the
rubber sector to the Government, and Table 2 shows the corresponding cashflows
of the Fund. Both tables show projected cash flows with and without acceler-
ating the program.
2.          Crucial assumptions underlying the cost and revenue forecast
relate to the assumption of a significant drop in the real price of fer-
tilizers (Annex 9, Table 8), to the price forecast for rubber (Annex 9,
Table 9), and to forecast rates of international and domestic inflation.
The projections also reflect present Government policy regarding the
taxation of rubber and the division of tax receipts between the Fund and
Treasury, 1/ and also regarding the level of grant payments to farmers. L/
By their regulation, the Government has considerable flexibility in con-
trolling both the resource transfer from the rubber sector, and also the
Fund's financial position. Thus the projections are sensitive not only to
unforeseen price changes but also to Government policy regarding taxation
and grant payments.
3.          With or without the accelerated replanting program, the Fund would
incur deficits during the next five years (Table 2). These deficits will
have to be financed either by raising the cess, by supplementary Government
financing, or by external financing. However, in each case the rubber
sector will continue to transfer resources on a net basis to the rest of the
economy. Net transfers from the rubber sector are estimated at about
US$25 million for 1975.
1/ Including the monthly determination of the "gazetted price,, on which
taxes on rubber are based, according to the following formulae:
Replanting cess    =  (Gazetted Price - 10 A/k)        .1 + .5
Export Duty        =  (Gazetted Price - 5.8 $/kg)    .
2/ The projections assume that the cash component of the grant will be
adjusted to remain constant in real terms. Howdver, the mission die
not accept the preparation report's proposal that the cash component
of the grant should be increased.  Under separate cover, the Financial
and Economic Analysis of the Project shows that present levels of the          0
grant provide sufficient incentives for replanting.



ANNEX 6
Page  2
Tax receipts will grow faster than production, because with the present
formula for taxing rubber, increases in the price level will increase the
real rate of taxation (see footnote, page 1). Without accelerating the
program, the net resource transfer from the rubber sector, in current
terms, would grow at the rate of about 30% between 1975 and 1979, as
opposed to a lower 20% rate with the accelerated replanting program.
However, this reduced resource transfer still leaves an ample margin
for the supplementary financing of the Fund's expected deficits during
the project period.
4.        Subject to the above provisos, during the period 1976-1979, which
is the proposed project period, the Fund would have a financial gap of about
$68.0 million over its expected cess revenues and reserves:

Financing Gap         -       1,360     1,360    -         68.0       68.0
/a   Assumes that present reserves of B 550 million are entirely drawn
down. Ilowever, if external financing in the amount proposed is
provided, the Fund would continue to earn interest income of
about US$5 million through 1976-79.
Assuming external financing of around US$60 million during 1976-1979, the
Government's financial contribution during the same period (in excess of
the Fund's normal cess revenue) would be easily manageable as it would
amount to less than 10% of forecast export taxes of about US$250 million
during the same period. However, during the subsequent five year period
(1980-1984) the Fund would face heavy deficits of about US$30 million per
year to sustain replantings at 50,000 ha/yr. Therefore, the Government
should be asked to consider how it intends, in due course, to sustain
the program and finance these deficits. Options again include raising
the cess, financing the deficit through budgetary allocations, continuing
recourse to external financing, reducing (moderately) the individual grants
in real terms, or a combination of these measures.

RUBBER REPLANTING PROJECT
World Market Prospects for Rubber
1.        During the post-war period, the world 1/ market for both natural
and synthetic rubbers - expanded at an average rate of about 6.2% per annum.
The slower demand expansion in two major consuming countries - the United
States and the United Kingdom - was more than offset by an above average
rate of growth in all other countries. Natural rubber supply increased by
only 2.5% per annum between 1950-52 and 1970-72, but synthetic rubber pro-
duction grew more than four times faster (at about 10.5% per annum). Conse-
quently, the share of natural rubber in the market for new rubbers outside
the centrally planned countries declined from 65% in 1950-52 to 33% in
1970-72. The market share of natural rubber declined faster in the United
States than in any other consuming area, but the advances of synthetic
rubbers were comon to all developed and developing consuming countries.
In 1972, synthetic rubbers net 78% of the market demand for all elastomers
in the United States, 65% of the total in Japan, 64% in Western Europe and
27% in India.
2.        The bulk of rubber is used in the manufacture of tires and other
automobile parts. In all developed countries, demand for rubber in these
end-uses expanded much faster than available supply of natural rubber. The
gap was met by synthetic rubbers: first styrene-butadiene rubber and then
polybutadienw and polyisoprene. Styrene-butadiene rubber has been by far
the most important substitute for natural rubber. It accounts for about
60% of total synthetic rubber production and 65% of total world estimated
synthetic rubber capacity. Polybutadiene is the second most important type
of synthetic rubber, followed by polyisoprene. Polyisoprene is the closest
man-eade approximation of the natural elastomer.
3.        Synthetic rubbers, a derivative of the rapidly expanding petro-
chemical industry, compete with natural rubbers at two levels: availa-
bility and price. In the post-war period, synthetic rubber producers
were not only able to rapidly increase their supplies to meet the grow-
ing market needs, but were also able to progressively reduce the produc-
tion costs and price of their products. Technological innovations and
scale economies played a considerable role in making synthetic rubbers
less expensive to produce. However, the key to the success of the in-
dustry was the seemingly unlimited availability of chemical monomers at
continuously declining prices. Synthetic rubber prices declined sharply
1/   Excluding the centrally planned countries.

(by over 40%) during the sixties and natural rubber prices followed suit,
although fluctuations around this declining trend were wider in the case
of natural rubber. This different behavior largely reflected the differ-
ent supply elasticities of natural and synthetic rubber; the supply of
natural rubber is more price inelastic in the short run than that of
synthetic rubbers. Demand for all elastomers, which is by nature a
derived demand, is quite insensitive to price changes, but very sensi-
tive to changes in aggregate economic activity. The speed at which
synthetic rubber producers can adjust their supplies to variations in
market demand (through capacity expansion and/or higher utilization of
existing capacity) is much greater than that of natural rubber producers
who cannot so easily transfer resources in and out of rubber production.
Although no clear consensus exists on the actual area of competition between
natural and synthetic rubber, it is nevertheless, evident that changes in
relative prices do encourage substitution of one type of rubber for another. 1/
4.        In the past two years, natural rubber prices have been fluctuating
fairly rapidly and have been characterized by two separate sets of circuui-
stances. The first rise, in 1972-73 was the result of the simultaneous
economic boom conditions all over the world, a boom which began to taper
off in the second half of 1973.  World consumption of natural rubber in-
0           cre"aed by 4% in 1972. Net exports of natural rubber, however, remained
at the same level as in 1971. Increased utilization in developed countries
was not matched by an increase in imports, as stocks were heavily dram
upon. The stagnation of import demand kept prices down throughout most
of the year, until stock replenishments and anticipatory buying, fostered
by monetary uncertainties, caused a sudden reversal of the trend in the
closing months of 1972. The price rise continued throughout most of 1973.
The upturn in industrial production in developed countries created a strong
demand for rubber and speculative buying also continued in 1973. Natural
rubber prices - in terms of RSSI, cif Now York - increased from 16.5 A/lb.
in April 1972 to about 44 1/lb. in July 1973.
5.        Towards the end of 1973, when the slowdown in industrial activity
in developed countries was beginning to affect demand for all elastomers
and prices of natural rubber were weakening, the availability of chemical
feedstocks for synthetic rubber was severely curtailed by the oil crisis.
Synthetic rubbers became scarce, their prices increased sharply and
natural rubber prices rebounded to new post-war peaks. RSSI, cif New
York, averaged at 55.5 A/lb in January 1974. These prices reflected
the scarcity of all elastomers, but also the expectation that the oil
crisis would drastically increase the cost and price of synthetic rubber.
Heavy speculations came to characterize the natural rubber market.
1/   Statistical analysis shows that the elasticity of substitution between
natural and synthetic rubber is of the order of 0.3. The estimate,
however, may be biased because reliable series of prices of synthetic
rubber are not available.



ANNEX 8
Page  3
6.       During 1974, with crude oil becoming progressively more availa-
ble and chemical feedstocks again in adequate supply, the real dimensions
of the oil crisis and it effects on synthetic rubbers began to become
clearer. The production costs of the basic type of synthetic rubber -
SBR 1500 - increased from 12-13 g/lb. to about 23 ct./lb. and its market
price from 17 i/lb. to 32-33 /lb. The very high price differential
between natural rubber and general purpose synthetic rubber could no
longer be maintained and natural rubber prices - in terms of RSSI, cif
New York - declined to 40 ct./lb. in June 1974.
7.       The economic slowdown in most developed countries, coupled with
the actual decline of real QIP in the United States and Japan, severely
hurt world demand for all elastomers during 1974. Car production in
Western Europe, Japan and the United States was badly affected. Conse-
quently, consumption of rubber in tires and other automobile parts de-
clined substantially. Preliminary estimates for 1974 show that, on a
world basis, consumption of all elastomers remained at the same level as
in 1973. During the course of the year the supply-demand situation com-
pletely reversed itself: from one of excess demand at the beginning of
the year to one of excess supply during the last 3-4 months of 1974.
Prices of general purpose synthetic rubbers declined by 10-15 percent
in the second half of 1974 and natural rubber prices continued to slide
downard to about 30 i/lb. in December, despite some attempts to support
the market through production cutbacks and stockpiling by the Malaysian
Government.
8.        The short-term price outlook for natural rubber does not appear
to be very bright. Demand for all elastomers is expected in 1975 to
increase only marginally above 1974 levels and substantial over-capacity
in the synthetic rubber industry is likely to keep general purpose syn-
thetic rubber prices at depressed levels. Natural rubber, however, will
marginally benefit from the above-average growth of some end-uses in which
it has a relative advantage over synthetic rubbers - heavy truck and farm
equipment tires - and from the growth of radial car tires, where the pro-
portion of natural rubber is greater than in crossply tires. Demand for
natural rubbers is, therefore, expected to increase moderately above 1974
levels. Natural rubber prices are anticipated to recover somewhat from
the low levels of December 1974 and to average at about 33 U/lb. (RSSI,
cif New York).
9.       World consumption of all rubbers is projected to grow at an
average annua rate of 5.4% between 1973 and 1980 (as compared with 6.2%
per a*aum registered between 1960-62 and 1970-72). 1/ Over the same period,
1/  Projected on the basis of the relationship between total elastomers
consumption and industrial production. Regression analysis shows
that a 1% increase in industrial production in OECD countries is
associated with a 1.18% increase in the desn.d for all elastomers.
About 98Z of the variation in elastomer consumption is explained by
the growth in industrial production.



ANNEX 8
Page 4
world supply of natural rubber is forecast to grow at some 5.6% per annum
at a considerably faster rate than in the sixties. 1/ Improvements in
yields are expected to account for most of the growth in rubber output in
the seventies. Production capacity of synthetic rubbers is forecast to be
around 8.8 million tons by 1977. 2/ Extrapolation of the trend would put
capacity at 10.0 million tons by the end of the seventies. To arrive at
the actual production necessary to meet total elastomers demand by 1980,
the utilization to capacity ratio in the industry would have to rise to
about 85%. The normal level of production in the synthetic rubber industry
has been in the past around 75% of total rated capacity. It can, therefore,
be expected that in the latter part of the seventies, synthetic rubbers
will remain in tighter supply than in the sixties and early seventies.
Natural rubber producers are then unlikely to encounter serious difficul-
ties in disposing of their supplies. In fact, a larger than expected
increase in natural rubber output - for example, through a more extensive
use of Ethrel - could possibly allow natural rubber to marginally increase
its share of world total rubber consumption.
10.       Excluding that eventuality, consumption of natural rubber out-
side the centrally planned countries is forecast to be growing during the
rest of the seventies at an average of 5.8% per annum. A reduction in the
rate of growth of natural rubber utilization in centrally planned countries
is anticipated to increase availabilities for the rest of the world.  Ac-
cording to this forecast, synthetic rubber consumption would increase at
5.2% between 1973 and 1980 and natural rubber would, therefore, maintain
about 32% of the world market for all elastomers. World net exports of
natural rubber are expected to grow during this period of time at 4.9%
per annum, an increase of about 1% in their average rate of expansion
with respect to the sixties.
11.       Analysis of the relationship between crude oil, basic chemicals
and general purpose synthetic rubber costs indicates that if one assumes
that crude oil prices will be in 1980 about $8.65 per barrel in 1974
constant dollars, SBR prices should be between 29 and 34 I/lb. Corre-
spondingly, RSSI, cif New York, should be selling at 31 to 36 U/lb. in
1974 constant dollar terms. In 1980 dollar terms, the price of natural
rubber is expected to be between 51 and 59 /lb.
12.       Beyond 1980, the prospects of natural rubber still appear to be
quite favorable on the demand side. Total demand for all rubbers can
be forecast to grow at about 6% per annum between 1980 and 1985. Poten-
tial supply of natural rubber - with existing acreage and available pro-
duction technology is, on the contrary, projected to grow during this
1/   Between 1960-62 and 1970-72 world production of natural rubber
*    increased at an average rate of 3.9% a year.
2/ See C.F. Ruebensaal, The Rubber Industry Statistical Report, 1974,

period at a much slower rate than in the seventies - at 3.7% per annum
between 1980 and 1985. This implies that the 1985 market share of natural
rubber outside the centrally planned countries would decrease to about 29%
because of insufficient supplies. To maintain 32% of the market - a feasible
objective in terms of the technical-economic potential of natural rubber -
producers should increase their output at 5.5% per annum between 1980 and
1985. The likely shortfall in natural rubber availability in the 1980's
points to the need of increasing natural rubber supplies beyond what appears
to be possible under present expansion plans.
13.       From the point of view of future prices, the prospect of natural
rubber appear to be favorable, if one assumes that crude oil prices will
remain at $8.65 per barrel, in constant 1974 dollar terms, and that no
major shift in the location of the petrochemical industry away from devel-
oped countries and in the direction of the basic raw material source - oil -
will take place in the 1980s. A drop in the price of oil would again make
the synthetic rubber feedstocks cheaper and increase the relative competi-
tiveness of general purpose synthetic rubbers. Similarly, a large, unco-
ordinated expansion of production capacity for petrochemicals in oil pro-
ducing countries would increase the supply of these products and - other
things being equal - depress their prices to the advantage of synthetic
rubber manufacturers.  To allow for the possibility of lower chemical
prices in the 1980s, the long run equilibrium price of natural rubber
is forecast to be around 33 U lb. in 1974 constant dollar terms.

RUBBER REPLANTING PROJECT
A. Financial and Economic Analysis
1.        Financial Returns.  Tables 1 and 2 illustrate on-farm development
costs and benefits at market prices under two different alternatives. Alter-
native I (Table 1) shows costs and benefits assuming that the farmer replants
with unselected seedlings. This alternative in effect illustrates the returns
to rubber replanting as they would be in the absence of the replanting pro-
gram. (New rubber planting with unselected seedlings is still widespread.)
Alternative II (Table 2) shows costs and benefits under the replanting pro-
gram, replanting with budded stumps.
2.        The financial return on investment (or the "return at market
prices") of planting rubber with high yielding varieties is estimated at
21% (Table 2).  In this calculation the consolidated return of Government
and farmers are set against costs at market prices, including labor.  This
calculation simulates the return of a private entrepreneur in a tax-free
industry, and shows that the planting of rubber under the proposed tech-
nology is financially viable. Additional benefits can be derived from
intercropping as detailed in Tables 3 and 4.
3.        Under the grant program, rubber growers and the Government share
the investment cost as well as the returns from rubber production. Returns
on investments, both for the farmer and the Government, are shown in Table
5, Part I. Financial returns to farmers are shown both with hired labor
and without taking labor into account. The latter return is relevant to
small holdings using family labor, the former for larger holdings using
hired labor.
4.        If family labor is used, the grant exceeds the cash outlay for
inputs; there is no net financial investmeat, and the farmer's rate of
return is infinite. Hence, net present values are used to compare alter-
natives. With hired labor, the replanter's rate of return would exceed
40%. (The sensitivity of rates of return to cost increases and benefit
decreases is shown in Table 6 and the assumptions relating to the level
of the grant, and price projections for fertilizers and rubber are shown
in Tables 7 to 9.)
5.        The Government's rate of return on investment would be about 12%,
which is lower than the cost of capital for government investment, estimated
at 15%. This assumes that the real rate of taxation remains constant, which
0          is the most conservative assumption. According to the present formula for
taxing rubber (see Table 9), the real rate of taxation would rise with the
price level. Assuming no change in the application of the formula and an
inflation rate of 7% the rate of return would be significantly higher.



ANNEX 9
Page 2
6. *Ypical Farm Budget.  Average yields of rubber in South Thailand
are about 50 kg/ha. Mature yields under high technology rubber cultivation
are estimated at 290 kg/rai or about six times the present average. The
income from rubber of a typical smallholder cultivating 15 rai is shown
in Table 4. His net farm income would rise from the present level of about
% 7,000 per year to about 9 35,000/year during the full maturity of the
rubber trees, that is from the 20th year from replanting until about the
35th year. However, because of the long period of maturation, no signifi-
cant increase of income occurs until the 10th year after replanting. The
farm budget shows the role of the cash component of the grant in evening
out the smallholder's income stream from rubber, assuming that he replants
his holding in successive stages to minimize short-run decreases in income.
Stages
7.        Phased Replanting.  Replanting a holding in one stage would nor-
mally impose undue financial hardships for a small farmer who depends en-
tirely on rubber for livelihood. Also, the development of the holding in
one stage underutilizes the productive capacity both of land and of avail-
able family labor. Family labor would be underutilized in Years 2-7 when
the labor requirement of maintaining the immature rubber averages only about
4 man-days per rai.  Similarly, land that could be intercropped would lie
idle, since family labor is not sufficient to intercrop more than about 2
rais of rice (Table 3).
8.        However, the staggered development of holdings evens out both
resource use and cash flow during the maturation of the young trees. It
would enable farmers to maintain a higher income both from intercropping
and from ethrel stimulation and slaughter-tapping their overaged rubber
trees. 1/ In addition, the grants would help supplement incomes during
the entire phase of immaturity.
9.        Incremenca. costs of intercropping with other crops (e.g. pine-
apples, soybeans, groundnuts) in addition or in lieu of rice raises the
returns from intercr!Wpping substantially above the conservative assumptions
in the Table 3. However, as these returns would in large measure depend on
favorable local conditions, and only a minority of farmers can be expected
to benefit from such opportunities.
10.       Incentives under the Project.  The grant not only provides the
technical inputs for high technology cultivation but also contributes a
cash component towards the financing of labor costs. The appropriate
level of grant paym'-nts, and in particular of the cash component, has
been a matter of controversy and will remain an important policy issue
1/   Incremental inco.aes by local stimulation could double incomes from
overaged rubber, but not taken into account in Table 5 since only
about half of smallholders are expected to use stimulation.



ANNEX 9
Page  3
facing the Fund (para 6.08 in the main text). The justification for cash
incentives under the grant applies differently to family operated small-
holdings and larger units operating with hired labor. With respect to the
smallholdings the aim of the cash incentive is to prevent a reduction of
income while only part of the rubber holding is productive. With respect
to the latter, the incentive of the grant can be evaluated in terms of the
rate of return on investment. As shown below, the present level of grant
payments provides sufficient incentives on both counts.
11.       The typical smallholder's income from rubber stagnates for about
10 years after the start of the replanting cycle. The cash component of the
grant through year 9 constitutes only 20% of the replanters net income from
rubber. Taking into account subsistence income from the typical smallholder's
subsidiary rice plot, his potential off farm income and income from ethrel
stimulation grant payments as a percentage of total smallholder's income
would be even lower. Therefore the real incentive of the program remains
the dramatic increase in productivity after the commencing after about the
10th year after the start of the replanting cycle rather than the cash
payment under the grant. While the increases in grant payments would pro-
portionately increase the Fund's expenditures they only have a marginal
effect on the replanter's financial situation. In the short run the cash
incentive can be considered adequate if it prevents abrupt fall in incomes
at the same time when famlly labor is required for land clearing and plant-
ing.  This is now the case.
12.       The commercial producer's financial rate of return from replanting
rubber with hired labor is summarized in Table 6. With the grant the re-
planter's rate of return would be about 41%. 1/ Without the grant (i.e.
assuming that the replant finances all the costs of replantings, the rate
of return would be only 18%; 1/ which can only be considered marginal in
view of significant risk due to market fluctuations, the high sensitivity
of returns to costs (also indicated in Table 6), the long maturation of
the investment, and the high foregone income on capital invested (short
term interest rates charged by local money-lenders range about 25% per
annum). Thus, while the cash component of the grant is an effective
incentive for encouraging commercial replanting, the present level of
the grant appears sufficient.
Economic Return
13.       The net benefits of the project are evaluated on the assumption
that in the absence of the program, the now overaged rubber holdings would
be replanted with unselected rubber seedlings. This is the most likely
alternative to the high technology replanting under the program. The in-
cremental cost and benefit streams are shown in Part 2 of Table 6.
1.   Foregone net income from cut-down trees is not included in these cal-
culations, as they would be insignificant for commercial producers
who have to hire labor for tapping overaged trees.



ANNEX 9
Page  4
14.       The economic rate of return on the incremental net benefit stream
of high technology replanting is estimated at 20% (see Table 6). The Fund's
administrative costs are to about 15% of grant payments and are included in
costs.
15.       Since there are no marked seasonal fluctuations in the project
area and since there is no evidence of agricultural unemployment, a wage
rate of 20 Baht/man-day (representing the lower end of the wage scale for
unskilled labor) has been taken to reflect the opportunity cost of labor.
Sensitivity of returns to a higher wages is indicated in Table 6.
16.       Domestic costs and benefits are given a weight of .9 relative
to foreign exchange costs and benefits, implying a shadow price of foreign
exchange of 1.1 relative to domestic funds. This raises the rate of return
by about half a percent. Shadow pricing foreign exchange does not materi-
ally affect returns since benefits as well as the costs consist mainly of
foreign exchange (Table 7 Part B).
17.       The fact that the transfer payments under the grant convert "un-
committed government funds" into consumption should, according to Bank
guidelines for economic analysis, somewhat lower the economic rate of
return of the Project. This effect has not been quantified.
B. Impact of the Project on Agricultural Incomes
in South Thailand and on Income Distribution
18.       The Importance of Rubber in the Economy of Southern Thailand.  The
following paragraphs are an effort to piece together the role of rubber in
the economy of South Thailand from the incomplete and often contradictory
data.
19.       Rubber is by far the most important cash-crop in Southern Thailand.
About half of cash income of all agricultural households derives from rubber:

Source:  Farm Household Survey, 1970.
20.       Assuming a planted area of about 10 million rais (RRC estimate)
and an average holding of 17 rais (1963 Agricultural Census), it would
appear that about 600,000 households are rubber cultivators. At six
heads per household, this would imply that about 90% of 4 million rural
population of Southern Thailand are engaged in the rubber sector, which
probably is an overestimate of the proportion of the population engaged
0Y         in the rubber industry.  On the other hand, if only half of agricultural
households produce rubber (as estimated by the Agricultural Census of 1963)
the average rubber holding would appear to be about 30 rais. This is prob-
ably an overestimate of the average holding size. If the truth is some-
where in the middle, it seems safe to assume that there are about 500,000
rubber holdings in South Thailand, averaging about 20 rais each, and en-
gaging about 75% of the rural population. 1/
21.       Rubber Production in Relation to Other Crops.  The two principal
crops in Southern Thailand are rubber and rice. Distribution of holdings
and the average area planted with rubber and rice in each category (as
estimated by the 1963 census) are shown in Table 10. The census also
estimated that about 80% of all holdings grow rice. If 75% of holdings
also cultivate rubber, this implies that there is a significant overlap
of rubber and rice production on the same holdings. Unfortunately the
census did not try to estimate the incidence of monoculture versus diver-
sified farming. However, it appears that most rubber holders have at least
subsidiary rice plots to meet their subsistence needs. An imputed value of
3000 Baht/household which is roughly equivalent to the cash value of enough
rice to support a family (Table 3) appears realistic for South Thailand.
1/   All of the foregoing assumes one household per holding, and no landless
rural households.  These assumptions appear realistic in the case of
46                Southern Thailand.  At the same time, wage labor and share-tapping
are quite common, as smallholders frequently earn cash income on big-
ger holdings (see Table 10, Part B3).



ANNEX 9
Page 6
22.       Based on the data in Para 19, and on the further assumption that
cash incomes of rubber holdings are similar to cash incomes of non-rubber
holdings, it would appear that rubber smallholdings derive about one-third
of their cash farm income from income other than rubber:
Cash Farm
Cash Farm         Income From Other      Percentage
Income from         Crops and Live-        of Total

Total %                   50                     50               100
23.       Income Distribution Within Agricultural Households.  Based on the
above one can hypothesize cash farm incomes from rubber by size of holding.
Table 10 Part Bi shows this hypothetical distribution assuming an average
yield of 50 kg/rai.  Comparing the hypothetical incomes and income distri-
bution with the results of a sample survey of rural households in 1970
(Table 10 Part B3), one finds that: (a) distribution of gross cash farm
income by size of farm is more equal than the hypothetical distribution;
and (b) that income distribution by size of farm is even more even.
24.       In fact quite unexpectedly, ownership of land appears only slightly
correlated with household income. (This does not necessarily mean that in-
come distribution is even in South Thailand, just that land ownership is
a poor predictor of income, see Table 10 part C3.) Another noteworthy
feature of the data is that large holdings appear to be less productive
than small holdings. This can be verified by the falling proportion of
income to average holding as the sized holding increases; note that the
hypothetical distribution conforms to the actual distribution of gross
farm incomes by size of holdings Part B3 up to the 30-45 rai category,
but not beyond. This impression is further substantiated in the Prepara-
tion Report for the Project.
25.       Income distribution data from another source (NSO 1969) are shown
in Part Cl of Table 10. It seems reasonable to assume that the bulk of the
rural population with cash incomes less than 6,000 Baht (54%) are comprised
of the households with less than 30 rais (64%). Since about 30% of all rub-
ber holdings are below 15 rais, there would be a high concentration of the
lowest forty percent of income-earners in South Thailand in this category.
(However, the statistics also imply that there are significant variations
of income within each category of holding size.)  Under the replanting pro-
gram, long-run net incomes derived from such small holdings would increase
to about $ 2,300/rai under rubber.



ANNEX 9
Page 7
26.       Rubber replanting grants are available to all rubber producers.
If incomes were strongly related to size of holdings, a random distribution
of grants would have no effect on income distribution in the rubber sector.
However, as it appears, income in South Thailand is only weakly related to
landholding (Para 24). To the extent that increases in income would occur
in proportion to landholding, income distribution of land is more uneven
than the distribution of income, and assuming no other changes in the
present pattern of income distribution, income distribution would become
less even.) This is verified by inspecting income distribution by size of
holding, as it would appear after full implementation of replanting old
trees. Assuming no change in this distribution, and that all cultivators
participate in the program, the hypothetical distribution of incomes after
the maturation of replanted rubber trees would appear as in Table 10, Part B.
This income distribution appears more uneven than present income distribution
(Table 10, Part Cl), or the present distribution of farm incomes according to
size of farm (Table 10, Part B3).
27.       This should not obscure the impact of rubber replanting on abso-
lute levels of income. As rubber presently accounts for about one-half
of cash farm incomes in South Thailand, the five-fold increase in rubber
incomes alone would, in the long run, triple agricultural cash incomes in
the region.  Rubber constitutes the principal source of cash income for
9           about 75% of rural households and income increases due to the project
will be spread over the great majority of the rural population.
28.       Impact on Income Disparity.  Only about 10% of the population
of South Thailand live in urban areas. Disparity between urban and rural
cash incomes is shown in Table 10, Part C. However, if a subsistence in-
come of about 3,000 Baht is imputed to rural households regardless of size
of holding, and considering that rural households do not pay rent, rural
incomes as shown by the Table could more or less be moved up one income
bracket, and income disparities would appear much less severe than indi-
cated by the Table. With the replanting program growth of incomes in the
agricultural sector could keep pace with urban income growth. However,
without the replanting program incomes in the rubber sector would soon
stagnate and this would indeed aggravate the not very dramatic rural-
urban income disparity as it now exists in South Thailand.
29.       Impact on Regional Income Disparities.  Within the agriculture
sector, cash incomes by region were estimated by the 1970 Farm Household
Survey as follows:
Region         Cash Income           Index
Central           7,154               100
South             3,954                55
North             3,761                53
Northeast         1,986                28
As the South is in about the middle of this distribution; the project appears
neutral with respect to interregional distribution within the agriculture
sector.

30.       Employment.  By lifting the financial constraints of the present
replanting program, the project will make possible the clearing of an incre-
mental 30,000 ha/year. At about 200 man/day ha for clearing and land prepara-
tion, this would mean about 30,000 extra jobs due to the acceleration of the
replanting program. In addition, the somewhat more intensive maintenance
requirements of replanted rubber holdings relative to old holdings would
result in a fuller utilization of family labor as well as some incremental
hiring of labor.

under the project: GT 1, PR 107, RRIM 600 and PB 5/51 (Annex 10, Appendix
la). (Annex 7, Appendix 1, d). They would be as follows:

tappings per tree with S2D2.
2.        No yield increases from stimulation are taken into account.  Ethrel
application would be developed by the Fund and adapted to smallholder use
under the project. This would result in considerably higher yields in years
27 to 35.

RUBBER REPLANTING PROJECT
NURSERY REQUIREMENTS
A. Incremental Nursery Capacity
1.        The technical specifications for nurseries and time schedules for
operations are given in Annex 10, Appendix la. The Fund will continue its
present practice of supplying planting material in the form of seed and
budsticks for field budding, and of budded stumps. Each of these systems
has its advantages and disadvantages. Ideally, supplies should be made in
the form of budded stumps because this saves the farmer between 6 and 9
months and shortens the immaturity period during which he derives no income
from the new rubber. However, field budding offers the advantages of a
higher rate of successful establishment, and therefore more uniform tree
growth and lower replacement expenditures.  Due to centralization of bud-         S
wood nurseries, transport of budded stump often takes more than 3 days.
This coupled with improper handling often leads to poor establishment.
2.        The Fund will therefore increase progressively the new replanting
area to be field budded from 40% now to 50% by 1979. Once the maximum level
of 50,000 ha of replantings p.a. is reached and consolidated by 1979, the
Fund will be able to give more attention and resources to budded stump pro-
duction. The Fund will also investigate the use of polybag budded stumps
and methods of planting older stumps which would further increase efficiency
of planting and reduce the immature period.
3.        Incremental capacity for budded stump nurseries is based on the
Fund targets, and on a ratio of 1 ha of nursery per 60 ha of field plantings.
Nursery capacity expansion would be made one year ahead of field plantings.

The average establishment cost per ha is t 94,350 (Annex 10, Appendix lb).
4.        Budwood nurseries would produce budsticks for both field budding
and budded stumps. Capacity would be expanded on the basis of 1 ha of
nursery per 300 ha of plantings; expansion taking place 2 years ahead of
field plantings.

B. Technical Specifications for Nurseries
5.        Planting Material.  Planting material would consist of selected
clones approved by the RRC as being sufficiently tested to ensure satisfac-
tory growth, yield and resistance to Phytophthora disease. For the period
1975-80 these clones are likely to be mainly GTI, RRIM 600, PR 107, PB 5/51
and PB 28/59. GTI would be the only suitable clone for regions in which the
serious Phytophthora disease occurs. Selection of clones for use on Fund
supported replantings would be the responsibility of a special Fund planting
materials committee which would include members from the RRC. The objectives
of the committee would be:

(i) Selection and distribution of clones for planting
including decision as to whether stumps or seed
at stake should be used in any area;
(ii) Determination of the current availability of
planting material and planning of a multiplica-
tion program in accordance with the future
replanting program;
(iii) Allocation of responsibility for the multiplication
program to particular organizations and nurseries;
(iv) Co-ordination of the multiplication program in
relation to quantity of material produced, clones
used and timing.
6.        RRC would ensure the use of selected clones, multiplication of
budwood and supply of budsticks to the replanting offices and registered
private nurseries.
7.        Establishment of budwood and budded stump nurseries
(i) Collection of stock seed
Seed would generally be harvested during peak seed
fall periods (August - September) when seeds are most
viable, with high germination capacity. Stock seed
for budding in the nursery or in the field would be
collected from:
(a) polyclone plantings of improved clones;
(b) monoclone plantings of improved clones;
(c) unselected seedling areas.
The major requirement is that the stock seed provide a
rootstock with a vigorous stem and a straight tap root.
(ii) At the commencement of the seed collection season, all
seed, old and new, should ideally be collected, used or
discarded, so that future weekly collections are of
fresh seed only.



ANNEX 10
Appendix 1
Page 4
(iii) Seed storage
The viability of rubber seed declines rapidly in storage.
If storage is necessary for 3-4 months, seed may be
stored in sealed polythene bags at 4°C. For short
periods, seed may be stored in moist sawdust at ambient
temperatures.
(iv) Seed germination
Ungerminated seed would not be nursery planted, the several
disadvantages to this practice being:
(a) lack of control of inter-plant spacing.
(b) if spacing is manipulated to allow even spacing
between plants, weak plants are frequently not
rogued out and hence the standard of stock seedling
selection is poor.
(c)  it is very wasteful of good stock seed, requiring
some 300,000 seeds/ha.
Seeds would be germinated in raised beds about 15 cm
high and 1 metre wide containing a loose sandy medium
or well-matured sawdust. (Self-sown seedlings must
not be used for stock nurseries.) Coconut or other
suitable fronds would be placed about 2 metres above
the beds to provide complete overhead shade. The
beds would be near to a water source and protected
by a fence.  The seed would be planted 1 cm apart
with micropyles facing downwards and the seed half
immersed in the medium. Approximately 1,000 seed
would occupy 1 square metre. Beds would be watered
morning and evening for six days after planting;
the beds should be examined daily, germinated seed
being picked out. Seeds germinating later than 21
days after placement in the beds would be discarded
in view of their poor vigour.
(v) Stock nursery
The site for the nursery must be selected:
(a) on fertile, free draining soil;
(b)  on terrain as flat as possible;
(c) near to an adequate water supply;



ANNEX 10
Appendix 1
Page 5
(d)  with easy road ae4szs;
(e) in a central position within each rubber
growing area.
(vi)  The future nursery area should be ploughed and
harrowed to a fine tilth to remove all weeds,
stumps, roots and rotting timbers. During the
final harrowing, there should be incorporated
into the soil 100 Kg/rai of rock phosphate and
where necessary, 40 Kg/rai of ground magnesium
limestone. The nursery should be securely fenced
to prevent animal interference.
(vii)  In stock nurseries, germinated seed should be planted
at 2 metres x 1 metre, omitting rows as necessary, to
mark off beds of different clones. Allowing for roads
there would be about 4,500 points/ha. To save time,
future budwood nurseries can, alternatively, be planted
with budded stumps.
(viii)  Stock nurseries intended for production of budded
stumps, should be planted with germinated seed in
double rows to allow easy access for budding, with
a spacing of 60 cm x 30 cm x 25 cm. Density would
be about 88,000 points/ha. About 15% additional
area should be allowed for roads and buildings.
(ix) One germinated seed would be planted per point,
the seed being planted flat side downwards, root
pointing downwards, the surface of the seed being
about 1 cm below the soil surface of the seed being
about 1 cm below the soil surface. Vacancies would
be supplied as soon as they occur.
(x) All double shoots growing from one seed would be
pruned leaving one shoot per seed. About 1 month
after planting, all genetic yellows, runts, poorly
grown plants and twisted seedlings would be removed.
The same operation would be repeated at 2 and 3
months after planting. The total number of plants
thinned out or unbuddable would normally approximate
to 20%.
(xi) Nurseries would be clean weeded using herbidices and
by manual means. Linuron would be applied immediately
after planting of germinated seeds; up to the start
of the dry season, further weeding would be manual
followed by immediate application of diuron. During



ANNEX 10
Appendix 1
Page 6
the wet season and at budding time paraquat would be
applied. At 2, 3 and 4 months after seed planting,
fertilizer would be applied. The mixture used would
consist of 3 parts sulphate of ammonia and 1 part
muriate of potash at 100 gm per running metre, broad-
cast between the two narrow rows.
(xii)  Nurseries should be irrigated by inexpensive sprinkler
systems during the dry season, when a desirable rate of
water application by sprinkler is approximately 1 cm per
day.
(xiii)  Budwood nurseries
Budwood nurseries should last for at least 10 years.
The beds may be of any convenient length and the four
corners would be marked with hardwood or cement posts.
The identity of the clone would be marked on these
posts. Several copies of a detailed plan of the
nursery would be prepared showing rows and points
budded with each clone.
(xiv)  Only one clone would be budded in each bed.  This
would be done at 5-8 months after seed planting,
during favourable weather conditions, where irriga-
tion facilities do not exist. Particular care would
be taken to ensure that the budwood used was authentic.
To avoid confusion, clones would be budded one at a
time. Failures would be re-budded until a full
complement of successful buddings was obtained.
(xv) Cutting back would be done when a full stand of
successful buddings had been completed, prefer-
ably in wet weather. Any seedling plants remain-
ing would be removed after cutting back the budded
plants.
(xvi)  Pruning rounds would be carried out every 2 weeks
to remove green scion shoots and side shoots from
the scion. Only one scion shoot would be allowed
to develop. Weeding would be manual or using MSMA
and Diuron. Fertilizer would be applied at approxi-
mately 2, 3 and 8 months after cutting back, with
adjustments for the local dry season. When bud-
shoots are 90 - 120 cm high, a 5 cm broad band of
paint would be applied 20 cm above the union to
verify correctness of the budshoot following
inspection by a trained clone inspector.  All
clonal bed markings would be regularly checked



ANNEX 1 0
Appendix 1
Page  7
before cutting each crop of budsticks. Any
shoots which had survived and could be mistaken
for budwood would be eradicated. For production
of green budsticks, multiple branching is encour-
aged by thumb nail pruning of the terminal bud
when the scion is 2 - 2-1/2 metres high. In the
first year of budstick production (second year
after budded stump planting) the scion would be
terminally pruned as described for the first
harvest of budsticks and cut back on two further
occasions for production of the second and third
harvest. In the second year, two scions would be
allowed to grow from each stock.
(xvii)  Harvesting of budsticks
Green budsticks would be harvested from source
bushes carrying fully expanded foliage approaching
complete hardness. The number of usable buds per
shoot would be increased by pruning off basal
leaves at least 10 days prior to harvesting bud-
sticks.  In the first year of budstick production
the yield of buds per source bush would be 3 har-                        _
vests x 3 budsticks per harvest x 2 buds per stick
1 18 buds. In the third and following years, 6
budsticks would be obtained per harvest giving
36 buds/bush per year. The production of budwood
in a stand of 4,500 bushes/ha is estimated to be:
Year 1 (planting)         nil            nil
Year 2                    18 buds/bush   81,000 buds/ha
Year 3 onwards            36 buds/bush   162,000 buds/ha
(xviii)  Packing budwood
Budsticks from source bushes would be wrapped in
damp gunny sacks for transport over short dis-
tances. For long distances budwood would be
packed between layers of damp mature sawdust.
Transportation should occur at night. For
storage over 2 days, the ends of the budsticks
would be dipped for a few moments in molten
wax. The maximum storage period is 4 days.

Budded stump nurseries
(xix)  Seedling stock would be green budded at 4-8 months
after seed sowing, at which time, stem diameter
at budding height should be 1.0-1.5 cm. Stocks
with viable buds would be cut back (not in the
dry season) 4 weeks after budding and shooting
should occur 7-10 days later. It is inadvisable
to leave buddings more than 90 days after budding,
before cutting back.
(xx) After stump pulling, the taproot would be trimmed,
where possible, to 30 cm and lateral roots to 10 cm.
Stumps would be laid in layers of damp lalang in
wooden crates, labelled with the clone number and
holding 300-400 stumps per crate.

(xxii) One hectare of mature source bushes (4,500 bushes)
would supply budsticks sufficient for 300 ha of
field, planted with budded stumps.
(xxiii) One hectare of plantable budded stumps (52,800
plants) would provide material sufficient for
60 ha of field planting, if an approximate 15%
allowance is made for nursery roads and buildings.

Production of Budded Stumps - Notes and Assumptions
Comment
Detailed records of the operations of the G.E.O. nurseries were not availa-
ble. The only source of data was Document No. 52 of the RRC, November 74,
"Estimation of Cost of Production of Budded Stumps at Klong Thom Rubber
Station." It is noted in the document that overall losses were high at
41% plantable budded stumps obtained from planted germinated seed. In
normal conditions the figure should be about 60% and the analysis in Table
assumes this latter level of efficiency.  It is further noted that
the data are neither highly accurate nor detailed and should be taken as a
guideline only. The 1973/74 costs are adhered to in this analysis, with
the exception of fertilizer which is taken at February 1975 prices and
wages which were treated similarly. All costs were rounded off. The cost
per budded stump is about 1.50 baht. With improved management and control
of nursery operations, this figure should be reduced. It is proposed that
nursery records be maintained in future with detailed breakdown of each
activity.

(17) Ditto. 1-1/2 successful budded stumps should be produced per
budstick. Therefore for 52,800 plants the number of budsticks
required is 35,200. Labour cost unchanged from 18 baht/day as
potential budwood sales could have been 50% greater.
(18) Approximate fertilizer usage at Klong Thom was 1,600 Kg/ha.
Pre-planting application should auount to 625 Kg rock phosphate and
250 Kg magnesium limestone/ha. Applications at 2, 3 and 4 months
after seed planting should be 100 gm per running metre, broadcast
between the two narrow rows, of a mixture of 3 parts sulphate asmonia
and 1 part muriate of potash. Fertilizer applicatione after cutting

(19) In the Klong Thom estimation all costs were charged to manual weeding.
Linuron (1,550 cc of a.i. in 500 litree/ha) should be applied
immediately after planting of seed.
(20) Based on Klong Thom costs.
(21) 2,900 baht/ha of nursery for boxes; 150 baht/ha for straw.
(22) Ditto. For a total of 10 hours operation per hectare. Depreciation

(25) 60% success (plantable budded stumps: germinated seed) is assumed.
Adjustments in cost are-not made for the higher level of success
(actual success at Klong Thom was 41%) as the total cost difference h
would be minor.

14. Overhead costs charged to budded stump nursery as at Klong Thom.
15. One year's production from a mature (year 3 after planting and onwards).
1.0 ha budstick nursery is sufficient to provide for one 5.0 ha
budded stump nursery. Establishment and maintenance costs for the
first 3 years are 85, 740 baht. Therefore, the cost of budaticks
for 1.0 ha of budded stump nursery would be approximately 17,000 baht
per ha 85,740 for the first two years of budwood production
5
(year 2 and 3), there being no production in year 1). This is an
approximation as budstick production in year 2 is about 50% of that
of year 3 and onwards. However, the figure is adequate for estimation
purposes.

THAILAND
RUBBER REPLANTING PROJECT
On-Farm Technical Specifications
1.        Land clearing, year 0.  The initial step in land preparation for
replanting would be the survey of the proposed area, carried out by field
staff of the RRAFB. The survey would result in demarcation of the peri-
meter boundary of the area, a broad classification of the soil and a
description of drainage and topographical conditions. Clearing of the
old rubber stand will either be carried out by chain saw contractors or
by the smallholder using either chainsaw or axe. To allow the smallholder
sufficient time to continue tapping other areas of old rubber and to inter-
crop and to allow a "clean start" to the replanting operation, it is con-
sidered advisable (where family labor supply is limiting) that the task
of underbrushing (where relevant), felling and cutting up the rubber
timber, be undertaken by contractors with chainsaws.  This should save
112 man days of smailholder time per hectare.  Timber would be cut into
2-3 metre lengths and where possible sold by the smallholder for firewood,
charcoal or box making. In certain instances, the smallholder may sell
the old timber in return for the operation of land clearing being done by
a contractor. Generally the cost of clearing where the timber is surren-
dered to the contractor would amount to 200 baht/rai. The remaining brush-
wood would be heaped and burned.
2.        Stump poisoning.  Old stumps would be painted in a 40 cm band with
a solution of 5%, 245-T tree killer, immediately after felling as a preven-
tive measure against root disease.
3.        Land preparation.  Where de-stumping is done, contract ploughing
and harrowing (twice for each operation) could be arranged, so that the
first dry rice intercrop could be sown at the start of the wet season,
following completion of lining. Intercropping is also possible without
destumping, but the area for exploitation would be reduced. Intercrops
would not be planted closer than 1 metre to the center of the planting
row.
4.        Lining and holing.  With the assistance of the RRAFB field
inspectors, smallholders would line and peg their areas. Where slopes
are over 120, the inspectors would also assist with contour lining and
terracing. Smallholders tapping their own rubber would plant at a
spacing of 8.0 x 2.0 metres = 625 trees/ha whereas estates employing
0             labour would plant at 8.0 x 2.25 metres = 555 trees/ha.  These higher
densities will lead to higher yields and will provide a measure of
insurance against yield limitation by root disease. Planting holes
would be 50 x 50 x 50 cm.



ANNEX 10
Appendix 4
Page 2
5.        Planting
(i) Budded stumps. Each smallholder would receive 750
budded stumps (including 125 supplies) per hectare
in year 0, for planting during the recognized planting
season. Those near to nurseries could receive supplies
within 2 months of planting; those more distant would
plant the supply plants in polybags, 20 x 50 cm lay-
flat. At planting, 120 gm rock phosphate would be
placed in the planting hole. Stumps would be firmly
planted with the bottom of the bud patch about 5 - 10 cm
above the soil surface. After planting the smallholder
should inspect the success of plant establishment at
monthly intervals for 3-4 months. Failures can be
identified within 1 month of planting and the first
and only round of supply planting would be carried
out within two months of initial planting. (20% of
supplies is anticipated to be the maximum.)
(ii) Seed at stake. Following pre-holing, refelling and
application of 120 gm tock phosphate, four germinated
seed at stake would be planted at each planting point
for subsequent budding. Planting would be done from
dawn to 10.30 a.m. at the latest and from 3.30 p.m.
until night fall. Seeds would be planted in the
same manner as in nurseries, but in a square with
the points 30 cm. apart. The surface layer of soil
(1 cm) over the seed should not be firmly packed.
Field budding would be carried out 4-8 months after
planting seed at stake and stocks budded as surplus
plants would be used as supplies and for sale to
neighbouring farmers through the RRAFB.
6.        Fertilizer.  The attached schedule of fertilizer quantities would
be used subject to minor modifications.
7.        Weeding.  Imperata cylindrica (lalang), the most dangerous weed
on smallholdings, if present at time of land preparation, would be killed
using dalapon in one of its commercial formulations (1.6 Kg a.i. per rai
to be repeated 3 weeks later - in 100 - 120 litres of water per rai); if
necessary at a later stage, clumps of lalang would be eradicated with
dalapon but smallholders and inspectors would pay particular attention
to preventing a resurgence of lalang. Otherwise weeding would be manual
and would consist of monthly clean weeding in years 0-3, of 2 metre wide
tree rows and forking out of woody growths in the tree avenues, in partic-
ular Eupatorium (Siam Weed) and Melastoma (Straits Rhododendron).
8.        Cover crops. At the end of year 3 in intercropped areas (or in
xrrce/Jnon-intercropped areas from the outset) leguminous covers con-
.isting of Calapogonium muconoides, Pueraria phaseoloides and Centrosema



ANNEX 10
Appendix 4
Page 3
pubescens, would be sown at a rate of up to 8 Kg/hectare. (Seed are readily
available at low cost.)
9.        Routine Maintenance of Rubber Trees.  Adventitious shoots would
be removed from the stock and side shoots of the scion, to a height of 2.5
metres (i.e. the reach of a smallholder without causing the tree to bend
over) so as to provide an uninterrupted trunk for tapping. With certain
trees of clone PRIM 600, branch induction will be necessary and this oper-
ation would be done under guidance of RRAFB staff.
10.       Disease and pest control
(i) The major disease, present mainly in the western part of
Southern Thailand, is Phytopthora botryosa leaf disease.
Another important disease is Phytopthora spp. (black
stripe panel disease). Phytopthora botryosa is found on
both crown and panel, whereas Phytopthora palmivora is only
encountered on the panel. It is not known whether botryosa
or palmivora are both casual organisms of black stripe or
whether only one of the species is casual. Young buddings
with Phytopthora leaf disease in the first year of growth
_                    should be treated with copper oxychloride.  Treatment of
later plantings is expensive.  The most effective preventa-
tive measure is to use the disease tolerant clone GTI (all
other clones used in Thailand are more susceptible) and
in the few Phytopthora susceptible areas where RRIM 600 has
been planted, to crown budd. RRC considers this policy safe
in that the number of non-crown budded RRIM 600 plants
remaining in the overall tree population of a region would
be low. Phytopthora (black stripe) is treated by application
of captafol (difolatan).
(ii) It is fortunate that there is a relatively low incidence
of Rigidiporus lignosus (white root disease) in Thailand.
This disease is a major yield limiting factor in Malaysia
and Sumatra and the RRAFB and the RRC should make every
effort to limit the spread of the disease. With increased
replanting, the incidence of the disease is likely to in-
crease. All cases encountered would be reported automati-
cally to the RRAFB and the RRC and the latter organization
would advise upon treatment.
(iii) Other disease and pests requiring attention are Corticium
salmonicolor (pink disease), Ceratocystis fimbriata (mouldy
rot) and Coptotermis (white ants). In areas where the leaf
disease Oidium heveae is prevalent, the clone PB 5/51 would
4                    not be planted.



ANNEX 1 0
Appendix 4
Page  4
11.       Inter-cropping.  The program would largely concern upland rice
and soya beans.  In de-stumped areas, approximately 75% of the land surface
can be inter-cropped; where the stumps remain, the area would be about 50%.
The present dry rice varieties require a 5 month season and would on the
average be planted at the start of the heavy rains in September for harvest
in February. Soya beans (either for home consumption or for seed supplies
to N. Thailand) would be sown in May when the rains start and harvested in
August. Alternatively mung beans (3 months season) or sweet corns (2-1/2
month season) could be grown. It is important that inter-cropping is prac-
tised in the May-August season, otherwise a heavy weed population will in-
vade the area prior to rice planting. RRAFB and the RRC would produce
technical leaflets on inter-cropping and would make arrangements for seed
of high yielding varieties to be available.

RUBBER REPLANTING PROJECT
Cost of Chain Saw Felling
1.        In the Hat Yai/Sadao area of Songkhla Province there are a few
chain saw operators. Most of these are employed in felling and cutting
up rubber trees.
2.        Capital Cost and Depreciation.  One 2 h.p. chain saw costs $ 10,000.
The life of a saw is 3-4 years, at 4 months usage per year amounting to 768
hours per year or a life of approximately 3,000 hours. (4 years x 4 months,
1 year x 24 days/month x 8 hours/day.)
3.        Operating Costs: Labor.  Number of man days required to fell,
cut into lengths, 150-200 trees (3-4 rai) using both axes and chain saws
- 10 m.d. Each saw is operated by 2-3 men who with one saw can fell
150-200 trees (3-4 rai) in 1 day of 8 hours = 2-3 m.d. A further 7-8 m.d.
is required to cut off branches, and cut the trunk and main branches into
lengths. Cost per man day - 70 baht. Therefore the labor cost of felling_
and cutting up is 700 baht to produce about 75-100 tons green wood.  (7-10
baht per ton.)
Fuel
15 litres petrol/day
1-1/2 litres engine oil/day
Spares and Saw
(M)
Cost of spares (excluding chains) and repairs per season -   2,500
Cost of chains (life of a chain is 14 days) at 315 baht
each.  Approximately 8 chiains per season                 -   2,520
Total spares, chains and repairs per year                   -   5,020
4.        Contract Cost.  Cost of clearing by chain saw is $ 400/rai (approx.
25 tons green wood). The labor cost to the contractors of felling and cut-
ting up is approximately 10 m.d  = 3 m.d. per rai at $ 70/man day - ^ 210/rai.
3-1/2 rai
Assuming that with one chain saw, the rubber wood from I rai can be felled
and cut up in a period of 1 day (3 men in 10 man days with 1 saw fell and



ANNEX 10
Appendix 5
Page 2
cut up 3-4 rai) then with one chain saw operating 96 days per year, 100 rai
can be dealt with by 1 saw in one year. Therefore considering depreciation,
labor and operating costs combined, the contract cost of chain saw clearing
is not excessive.

RUBBER REPLANTING PROJECT
Intercropping Possibilities
1.        Background.  Intercropping can be carried out in young rubber
for a period of 3 - 3-1/2 years, during which, it could be possible to
grow 6 - 7 successive intercrops. The objective of intercropping from
the national viewpoint is maximization of land productivity. The advan-
tage to the smallholder is the generation of income to compensate for
loss of revenue following rubber replanting and during the long non-
productive period.
2.        At present, intercropping is done on about one third of the young
immature rubber areas in Thailand. The major intercrops are upland rice,
sweetcorns, groundnuts, sweet potatoes, chillies, watermelon, tobacco,
pineapples and bananas.  Soya bean has considerable potential for the
future.  All rubber land is not suitable for intercropping and it is
estimated that unsuitable topography and soil type would reduce the
potential area for intercropping to 60% of the area for replanting.
Intercrops cannot be grown closer than 0.5 meters from the rubber trees
in years 1 and 2 and 0.75 meters in years 3 - 3-1/2. Within any rubber
area suitable for intercropping, therefore, 75% of the land can be inter-
cropped in years 1 and 2 and 60% in years 3 - 3-1/2. The potential area
for intercropping would, therefore, be reduced to about 40% of the area
for replanting.
3.        Although it is very desirable that smallholders are encouraged
to intercrop (subject to agronomic and economic limitations), there are
currently several major constraints to this practice in Thailand.
4.        The constraints are:
(i) Although there is a lack of information on farm size,
cropping patterns and labor availabiliby, it is known
that many rubber farmers have their own paddy land
and that rubber production is but one of several farm
activities. The general situation in the past has been
a relative abundance of land and scarcity of labor.
Therefore, there is considerable doubt as to whether
intercropping could be carried out on more than the
present 33% of area for replanting. (With the imple-
mentation of HLTS programs in the final years of pro-
duction, even less labor would be available for inter-
cropping than before.)



ANNEX 10
Appendix 6
Page 2
(ii) Efficient intensive intercropping is only possible where
trees are destumped and the land is thoroughly cultivated.
Unless this work can be done mechanically, farmers will
generally be unable to intercrop efficiently. Insufficient
family or hired labor is available to perform this opera-
tion manually. (General experience in Southeast Asia is
that the average smallholder family with two work units
can only manually clear, plant and intercrop one hectare
of rubber in one year.) The program, however, envisages
an average individual replanting of 2 hectares at a time.
(iii)  During periods of low rubber prices, hired sharetappers have
little incentive and, consequently, at such times the burden
of tapping would fall on the family.
(iv) There are considerable technological problems, in that
yields of intercrops are poor, agronomic techniques are
not well developed, fertilizer is rarely used and expen-
sive, and high yielding seed, even of upland rice, are
not readily available.
(v)  There is little information on suitable crop rotations,
but several successive crops would have to be taken to
justify initial clearing costs.
(vi) Apart from rice, there is little knowledge of marketing
outlets and further marketing studies are required.
(vii) Financial incentives for intercropping are generally
insufficient.
5.        The above constraints apply to a lesser extent in the case of
pineapples and bananas, but these are crops for specialized markets with
a limited total requirement. Had organized land clearing services and
high yielding rice and soya bean seed been widely available, then there
would have been strong justification, in the case of farmers without
paddy land and with adequate labor, having assistance in at least the
first year of the grant to clear and to grow two intercrops. (Where
labor is short, it would be dangerous in terms of standards of rubber
cultivation, to encourage smallholders to intercrop.)
6.        During the course of the project, development work could be
usefully carried out by a new RRAFB intercropping unit in cooperation
with the RRC, into tree disposal and land clearing techniques and into
the many aspects of intercropping in rubber areas.
7.        Present costs of mechanical clean clearing and land cultivation
are prohibitive at 830 baht per rai.  The RRAFB intercropping unit could
is             focus initially on smallholders with small rubber lots (less than 15 rai)
and no outside paddy land and whose rubber wood is cleared and sold but



ANNEX 10
Appendix 6
Page 3
not destumped. These smallholders should be able to plant and maintain
up to 12 rai of replanted rubber, with intercrops over 50% of the area
planted to rubber. (A further 25% of rubber land is unavailable due to
the presence of the old rubber stumps (para 2.7)). The cost of rice and
soya bean seed for the first year of intercropping would be 50 baht/rai
and fertilizer (60 kg/rai) would cost 180 baht/rai. The RRAFB could
provide this seed and fertilizer to such farmers at cost.

RUBBER REPLANTING PROJECT
High Level Tapping and Ethrel Applications
1.        High Level Stimulation Tapping Before Replanting.  Most of the old
seedling rubber in Thailand has been tapped repeatedly and the renewed bark
is thin and unproductive. However, there are considerable and worthwhile
reserves of virgin bark higher up the tree. In most of these areas, yields
could be raised by 50-100% for a period of several years through high-level
tapping and ethrel (2-1/2/5%) stimulation of the virgin bark (HLTS). High-
level tapping on one cut per tree is easily carried out using the "long
handled V-shaped gouge." During the last year of tapping, slaughter tap-
ping would be introduced on two upwards cuts per tree.
(i) Program of HLTS. Following a survey of the suitability
of areas for HLTS, the RRAFB would organize a zonal HLTS
program limited to a program of replanting.  Typical
tapping schedules would be:
(a) For well-grown trees with a 3-6 year period of
exploitation before replanting: S/3 d/2 with
stimulation monthly for eight months per year.
(b) For trees to be replanted in 1-2 years. S/2 d/2
witt monthly stimulation for eight months per year.
(c) For trees to be felled in less than one year
(slaughter tapping): 2S/3 d/2 with cuts separated
by 75 cm with stimulation monthly. During the final
3-6 months tapping would become daily.
2.        Tapping in Replanted Areas
(i)  Tappers would receive instruction in marking and opening
of panels, tapping, tree hygiene including panel disease
control and cleaning of tapping knives, spouts and cups
and in preparation of crop for despatch to the purchaser.
Trees would be opened at 150 cm above the bud union when
60% of the stand has reached a girth of 50 cm and bark
consumption on alternate daily tapping would not exceed
25 cm per year.
(ii)  Tapping would normally commence at the end of the dry
season at 6-3/4-7 years after planting with a task of
500 trees and 300 tappable trees per ha. During this



ANNEX 10
Appendix 7

period the yield has been assumed to be 500 kg/ha; in
year-3 of tapping a full stand of 500 trees/ha should be
in tapping.
(iii) With the exception of certain clones on panel A, the half
spiral alternate daily stytem S/2, d/2 would be used on
panels A, B. C, and D. Trees would be rested for 1-2 months
during the dry season. It is assumed there will be 280
tapping days in a year and 140 tappings on each tree;
(iv) Tapping standards would be periodically examined by the
RRAFB staff to ensure that the objectives of good tapping
are being obtained. These are to apply tapping systems
which obtain high yields while:
(a) using as little bark as possible;
(b) permitting satisfactory tree growth and bark
renewal;
(c) preventing bark disorders such as brown bast.
(v)  Excessive bark consumption rates and a high incidence of
wounding can be considered as reliable evidence of poor
tapping standards.  Excessive bark consumption can be the
result of too thick a shaving of bark being excised per
tapping or too high a frequency of tapping. Wounding is
due to tapping being too deep and causing damage to the
cambium layer. Where tapping standards are poor, further
training of smallholders will be necessary.
(vi) Tappers would be instructed to deal with the serious panel
disease, Phytophtora (black stripe) by the RRAFB and the RRC.
(vii) Where feasible, an incentive system would be introduced to
promote improved tapping by hired tappers.
3.        Yield Stimulation.  The HLTS program involves ethrel stimulation.
The requirements of ethrel are attached. When ethrel application is by
means of bark scraping, a concentration of 2-1/2% is optimum.  However
most smallholders prefer application by painting. With this method, the
optimum concentration is 5%.
4.        Yield Projections.  The yield projections used are those predicted
by the RRC for areas planted at 500 trees/ha, tapped S2d2 on 140 days/year
and receiving regular and adequate fertilizer. For reasons of conservative
estimation, the mission would have reduced these yields by 10% each year.
However, planting density and tappable stand will be increased to 625
trees/ha and 500 trees/ha respectively in year 3-4 of tapping.  This              *

increase should raise yields above the RRC predictions and on this basis
the RRC projections were considered satisfactory for the new tree densi-
ties which are proposed. Without stimulation, it is estimated that yields
will reach 1,800 kg/ha in year 7-8 of tapping. Yields on commercial estates
in N. Malaysia in similar climatic and environmental conditions, using similar
planting material, would be estimated to reach 2,200-2,500 kg/ha at the same
stage. Where smallholders have taken advantage of a satisfactorily supported
planting program, the yields obtained should not be less than those of com-
mercial estates. In fact, yields may be larger, in view of higher densities
and more intensive family tapping. The major smallholder yield problem will
be related to rate of bark consumption, which if not controlled to reasonable
levels will lead to early exhaustion of bark reserves. An important part of
the project will be to guide tappers in the conservation of bark. Fortunately
the standard of tapping in terms of wounding is generally good. The yield
projections assume good husbandry, adequate fertilizer in both immature and
mature phases and improving standards of bark consumption and take account
of the remarkably low incidence compared with Malaysia and Indonesia of im-
portant yield limiting factors, wind damage, root disease and brown bast.
The large yields per ha already being achieved by successful smallholders
are also considered in these yield projections. It will be important to
demonstrate the benefit of fertilizer application in mature rubber. A
recent RRIM survey showed that on average, yields from fertilized small-
0          holdings were some 30% larger than unfertilized, measured over 14 years
tapping. Over 25 years tapping, particularly where stimulant is used,
this difference could well reach 40%.
