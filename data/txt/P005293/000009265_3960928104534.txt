REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO USS25.0 MILLION TO THE
JORDAN PHOSPHATE MINES COMPANY LIMITED WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE
HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN FOR THE INTE. RATED PHOSPHATE PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Jordan Phosphate Mines Company Limited (JPMC) for US$25.0 million equivalent is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan, which would help finance the
Integrated Phosphate Project and would be guaranteed by the Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan, would carry a standard variable interest rate with a maturity of 17
years including 5 years of grace.
2.       Background.  Phosphate is Jordan's most important natural resource and
the country's major foreign exchange earner. JPMC is an integrated company
engaged in mining and beneficiation of phosphate rock and the manufacture of
phosphate fertilizer. It has progressively increased exports of phosphate rock
from 2.2 mt in 1978 to 5.8 mt in 1988, 12.7 percent of present world trade, by
taking advantage of Jordan's favorable location relative to growing Asian/Far
Eastern markets and ensuring that FOB costs are competitive with other world
producers. Traditional phosphate areas have limited reserves. Under Loan
2902-JO, approved in January 1988, production from the new Shidiya deposit,
which contains over 1 billion tonnes reserves at low stripping ratios, is being
initiated. Production at Shidiya will progressively replace declining
production at existing mines and will enable rock exports to be increased to 6.5
mt by 1991. Implementation of this project is proceeding satisfactorily and
phosphate rock production is planned at 0.3, 1.0 and 1.5 mt in 1989, 1990 and
1991, respectively. The fertilizer plant at Aqaba continues to face technical
constraints that limit production of fertilizer products to 74 percent of design
capacity, compared to a typical capacity utilization of 90-95 percent at most
worldwide fertilizer plants. Following initial years of financial and technical
difficulties at the fertilizer plant, the Government decided to integrate
phosphate mining and fertilizer operations and transferred responsibility for
the fertilizer plant from Jordan Fertilizer Industries (JFI) to JPMC in 1985.
At that time, the Government assumed IFC's interests. JPMC has effectively
managed the plant and through aggressive marketing, the fertilizer operation
reached a profitable status in 1988.
3.       The proposed borrower (JPMC) is a commercial enterprise.  In November
1987, as part of the first project, JPMC sought to double its share capital and
publicized the offering at home and abroad, with a view to attracting private
sector participation in the share holdings. However, private sector response
was poor, most likely due to the political and economic uncertainties in Jordan
and the Middle East; only 2 percent of the offered shares were purchiased.
Eventually, two major institutional investors, the Government of Kuwait and the
Jordanian Social Security organization, purchased all the offered shares. As a
result, the direct ownership of JPMC by the Government of Jordan has been
reduced to 38 percent. The Jordan Social Security fund owns 20 percent of JPMC,
another 20 percent is owned by the Government of Kuwait, and the balance, 22
percent, is owned by numerous Jordanian and Arab individual and private



institutional shareholders. In view of its present debt/equity ratio of 0.44,
JPMC is not planning a capital increase in the near future. JPMC's shares are
listed on the Amman Stock Exchange and are openly traded and available to
private sector interests.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has been requested by JPMC
and the Government to continue to provide extensive technical, economic and
strategy advice to assist the development of the phosphate sector. Under the
previous loan, the Bank assisted JPMC to (i) initiate mine development at
Shidiya in a low-cost, low-risk manner; (ii) initiate rationalization of the
phosphate sector; and (iii) address the need to rehabilitate the financially-
troubled fertilizer plant. The Jordanian authorities regard the Bank as a
unique source of technical advice and financial support for JPMC in this crucial
transition period. Following the merger with JFI, JPMC is trying to resolve
complex technical problems at the fertilizer plant and to introduce modern
beneficiation technology to improve the efficiency and the economics of mine
operations. The Government is also considering merging the ailing Aqaba Railway
Corporation with JPMIC, since it is the railway's only customer. At this
critical juncture, the Government and JPMC have requested continued Bank
involvement to ensure (i) systematic introduction o' complex phosphate
beneficiation technology into Jordan along with a rational project design; (ii)
the further development and integration of Shidiya phosphate rock production
with declining production from traditional mine areas; and (iii) the systematic
rehabilitation of Jordan's fertilizer sub-sector. The proposed project is
consistent with the Bank's lending strategv, which includes support for export-
oriented projects. IFC has not shown any interest in participating in this
project, in view of the still public sector nature of the company, and IFC's
earlier withdrawal of equity from the fertilizer unit of JPMC. Bank
participation would fill in the gap in the financing plan, after the support
available through cofinancing and an appropriate level of JPMC-generated funds
have been taken into account.
5.       Sector Strateev.  JPMC recognizes that Jordan's phosphate industry
requires further expansion and vertical integration, to increase domestic value-
added and to enhance product diversification and market flexibility. To meet
these objectives, JPMC plans, as initial steps to continue expansion at Shidiya;
to rehabilitate its fertilizer plant; and to collect and utilize phosphate fines
in that plant. For the longer-term, JPMC has initiated extensive discussions
with various countries to expand fertilizer production in Jordan through joint-
venture operations. Further restructuring of the phosphate sector is being
initiated by the Government through the investigation of alternative
institutional arrangements for captive phosphate rail transport.
6.       Project Objectives.  The main project objectives, designed to support
this strategy, would be (i) the development of a beneficiation plant at Shidiya
to increase rock production and raise rock exports to 7.0 mtpy by 1994, thus
enhancing Jordan's foreign exchange earning capability while offsetting the
declining production at existing mines; and (ii) the rehabilitation of the
technically and financially troubled fertilizer plant to meet and, nominally,
exceed original design capacity. The project would also aim at [i] integrating
the expanding Shidiya development with traditional mine areas, where reserves
will be exhausted over the next 10-15 years; and [ii] enhancing the overall
profitability of the restructured phosphate industry sector.

7.       Frolect DescriRtion.  A beneficiation plant and related facilities for
phosphate rock and cake handling, storing, reclaiming and loading would be
developed at Shidiya to produce 1.5 mtpy phosphate rock products. The expansion
of mine and social infrastructure would be encompassed by the project as would
technical assistance. The fertilizer plant would be rehabilitated to increase
phosphoric acid production by 36 percent and to nominally increase exports of
DAP and phosphoric acid to 740,000 and 59,000 tpy by 1993. The total cost of
the project is estimated at US$161.7 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$128.5 million equivalent. A breakdown of the costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement,
disbursement and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable
of key p'roject processing events and the status of Bank group operations in
Jordan are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report No. 8190-JO, dated January 8, 1990, is being distributed
separately.
8.       Actions Agreed On.  Agreement was reached with JPMC during negotiations
that it will:
(i) maintain separate accounts for the Mining and Fertilizer
Units, as well as consolidated accounts;
(ii) submit annual audited financial statements, together with
the auditor's report to the Bank within six months of the
end of each fiscal year;
(iii) enforce and monitor the environmental and occupational
health and safety standards at the beneficiation plant
and fertilizer plant ane ensure that the standards are
maintained in a manner satisfactory to the Bank;
(iv) establish Project and Cost Control Units with company
personnel of qualifications and experience satisfactory
to the Bank;
(v) execute a contract, to terms and conditions acceptable to
the Bank, for project management services for the
rehabilitation of the fertilizer plant;
(vi) maintain a working ratio (working expenditures/current
revenues) below 0.8, and satisfactory debt service and
long-term debt/equity ratios of above 1.5 and 60/40
respectively;
(vii) update annually its five-year investment plan in
consultatiou; with the Bank at least six months prior to
the beginning of the fiscal year;
9.       Agreement was reached during negotiations that the Government
will provide the Bank with an opportunity to review and comment on
proposals for institutional and financial arrangements for phosphate rail
transport. The proposed loan will become effective only upon receipt of
satisfactory evidence that all project-related cofinancing loan



- 4 -
agreements with the Kuwait and Arab Funds are effective and that JPMC has
established Project and Cost Control Units with company personnel of
qualifications and experience satisfactory to the Bank. The execution of
a project management services agreement to terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank will be a condition of disbursement for the
fertilizer component of the project.
10.      Benefits.  The project would contribute to increasing Jordan's foreign
exchange earnings and to rationalizing and streamlining the phosphate industry.
Favorable geological/metallurgical and geographical conditions place the
be,leficiation plant component of the project among the lowest in terms of
worldwide production and investment costs. The fertilizer plant rehabilitation
component of the project would enable fertilizer production to attain a
profitable status. These factors are evidencqd by the projected financial and
economic rates of return in excess of 17 perceat and 26 percent, respectively.
The net balance of payment impact of the project is approximately US$1 billion,
over 20 years. In addition, the project would generate directly about 350 jobs
and, indirectly, at least 100 jobs.
11.      Risks.  Although the oversupply of phosphate fertilizers in the world
market has declined, market and price risks associated with the project have
been reviewed in detail and, on a conservative basis been found acceptable. The
phosphate rock production increase resulting from the project represents less
than 1 percent of world demand and would not increase significantly Jordan's
phosphate market share. The project's rock production would be absorbed mainly
by the growing Asian and Far Eastern markets, and would help to replace the
output from depleted mines in Oceania. Jordan has a significant cost advantage
in these markets, compared to its major competitors. Jordan is a marginal
producer of phosphate fertilizers and the project's increase in fertilizer
production is insignificant in relation to world trade. Jordan's fertilizer
market share will continue to decline. Sensitivity analyses have demonstrated
that the company and the project can sustain price and market prospects
substantially lower than projected and remain financially viable. The project's
beneficiation component faces no higher technical risks than those normally
associated with mineral beneficiation. All project activities involve proven
technology that has been in regular use in the industrialized world and, with
the exception of the flotation component of the beneficiation plant, in Jordan.
JPMC has considerable experience with the implementation of beneficiation plants
and has developed sound project management techniques and tools. The risk of
project implementation delay has been reduced by the careful selection of
turnkey contractors for critical path activities and by the selection of an
international construction management group to supervise the fertilizer plant
rehabilitation.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
