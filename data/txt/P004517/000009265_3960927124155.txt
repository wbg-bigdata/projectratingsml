FINANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
Loan Summary
Borrowers        Republic of the Philippines
Amount:          US$300 million equivalent.
Terms:           The Bank loan will be for 20 years, including 5 years of
grace, at the standard variable interest rate.
Program
Description:   The broad objective of the proposed financial sector reforms
is to strengthen the financial system, particularly the
commercial banking segment. More specifically, the reform
program aims to:  (a) strengthen the supervision and
regulatory framework for commercial banks, (b) improve the
institutional arrangement for depositor protection,
(c) reduce intermediation costs in the banking system, and
(d) improve the institutional framework for the mobilization
and delivery of long-term credit.
Bank supervision and regulation would be improved through
Ci) strengthening legal and supervisory framework so as to
empower the Central Bank of the Philippines (CBP) to take
corrective actions in a timely fashion with respect to
problem banks and, if necessary, to effect bank closures; and
(ii) improving supervisory and regulatory procedures.
Arrangements for depositor protection would be strengthened
by enlarging the role of the Philippine Deposit Insurance
Corporation (PDIC) to empower it to act as receiver-
liquidator of failing banks and strengthening it finaneially
and institutionally. Intermediation costs would be recw.ced
through promotion of more effective competition, reduct on
and elimination of certain taxes on financial intermediation
and improvement of laws governing debt recovery and
insolvencies.  Fund mobilization and medium- and long-term
credit delivery would be enhanced by revamping the
Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) to enable it to act
essentially as a wholesaler of long-t'rm funds, and by the
elimination of the role of the Centra: Bank of the
Philippines in the management of government sponsored credit
programs.
The Export-Import Bank of Japan is likely to cofinance the
proposed loan in an amount equivalent or close to the Bank
loan.



-ii -  
To help the Government implement the adjustment program, a
technical assistance program funded through a grant by the
Government of Japan will be undertaken.  This-will involve
upgrading the staff and srytems capabilities of CDP, PDIC and
DBP.
Benefits:        The loan will support broad development efforts of the
Government. This support will come in the form of li)
encouraging policy and institutional reforms, (ii) providing
direct balance of payment and budgetary support, and
(iii) improving the banking environment which should lead to
better savings performance in ths,future. It is expected
that bank supervision and regulation functions will improve
in effectiveness and less time will be wasted in unnecessary
litigation which has been a,problem in the past. The reforms
are expected to enhance confidence in the banking system,
improve efficiency and lower the cost of services provided to
real sectors, and give an impetus to overall economic
development and growth. In short, the reform program is
expected to result in a healthier, more competitive and
efficient banking system, with consequent benefits to the
investors and savers alike.
Risks:           The principal risk is that the legislative action could
either be unduly delayed or prove to be deficient when
completed. The risk is mitigated by the fact that the key
amendments have already been drafted and presented to the
Congress so that the legislative process has already begun.
Satisfactory progress, including actual passage of key
legislation, will be a condition for the release of the
second tranche. The Government's commitment to carry out the
needed reforms is very high, and a significant number of
prior actions have already been taken.
Estimated
Disbursements, The proposed loan would be disbursed in two equal
installments. Given the actions already taken and to be
taken prior to Board presentation, the first tranche of
US$150 million equivalent would be available for disbursement
as the loan becomes effective. The second tranche, also of
US$150 million, would be released after completion of the
agreed actions. Disbursements are estimated as follows:
FY90         FY91
-- US$ million --
Annual                           150          150
Cumulative                       150          300

Report:        This is a combined President's and Staff Appraisal Report.



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXE(CTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED 'LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A FINANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM
I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of the Philippines for the equivalent of US$300 million-to
support a Financial Sector Adjustment Program. The loan would have a term of
20 years, including five years of grace, at the standard variable interest,
rate.
I. THE ECONOMY
Introduction
1.1      Recent Bank economic reports 1/ have given a detailed account of-the
performance of the Philippine economy. In brief these reports indicate that
while economic growth in the Philippines was rapil during the 19708,
distortions in the pattern of incentives resulted in inefficient investments,
slow growth in employmentand low levels of domestic savings.   Heavily
dependent on imports and foreign capital, the economy did not adjust well to
the severe external Mhocks of the post-1979 period - high oil prices and
interest rates, and aecliu-ing export prices. The economy experienced
declining growth rates, a deteriorating balance of payments, and the
accumulation of a large external debt. A political crisis in 1983, combined
with a world-wide debt crisis, led to a cessation of foreign credits, and
forced the Government to embark on a major stabilization effort.
Stabilization and Macro-Economic Issues
1.2      The Government's stabilization measures were supported by
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Standby Arrangements of Decembei 1984 and
October 1986.  Overall, the objectives of the stabilization programs have been
met or surpassed. Inflation has been brought under control with the consumer
price index Legistering an increase of 8.82 in 1988 and 3.82 in 1987, compared
to 502 in 1984 and 23Z2 in 1985. The current account swung from a deficit of
4.8Z of GNP in 1984 to a surplus equal to 3.02 of GNP in 1986, and showed only
slight deficits in 1987 (1.32) and 1988 (1.0Z). GDP growth was positive in
1986 after two years of decline, showed an impressive acceleration to 4.72 in
1987, and is estimated to have grown by 6.62 in 1988. The economy is now
substantially more open and distortions have been reduced.
11 Philippines: An Agenda for Adjustment and Growth (Report No. 5268-PH,
November 30, 1984), Philippines: A Framework for Economic Recovery
(Report No. 6530-Pd, November 5, 1986), Philippines: Toward Sustaining
the Economic Recovery (Report No. 7438-PH, January 30, 1989).



-2-
1.3      The remarkable progress made thus far by the Philippine economy
should not mask the challenges that lie ahead.  The Government's fiscal
situation remain's a cause for worry, with the public sector'deficit in 1988
estimated at 3.42 of GDP. Overall, the investment'rate is low (about 182 of
GNP) and wll¢. have to rise substantially if growth is to be sustained. This
will put added strain on the resource mobilization capacity of the economy.
At present, the financial sector remains largely a source of short-term -
working capital.  VIiAle some sources of long-term funds exist within the
economy, there presently exists no institution capable of tapping these funds
and making them available to the private sector for investment.
1.4      The external debt which peaked in 1986 at 92.9S of GNP remains a
serious problem.  Even after two reschedulings of commercial bank loans in
1985 and 1987, and two with the Paris Club, the debt service ratio was 362 for
1987. In the short- to medium-term, the Philippines will continue to depend
heavily on external financing to meet itt savings shortfall and to pursue the
growth strategy which is expected, in the longer-term, to lead to reduced
fiscal and current account deficits and to sustained growth.
Savings and Investment
1.5      While the country has enjoyed rapid growth despite low investment
rates, once excess capacities are fully exhausted it will be necessary to
raise the investment rate to a level sufficient to maintain the rate of
growth. Raising the savings rate may be difficult, particularly in light of
the need to undo past declines in private consumption and provide for some
real improvement in living levels. In the past, and despite the recession,
the private sector has had a substantial savings rate. During the 1983-87
period, private sector savings averaged about 17.52 of GNP (see Table l). The
public sector, however, was a net dissaver, with an average rate of -2.12. At
the same time, public sector investment averaged only 4.12 of GNP, so that the
public sector was tapping private savings to fitance public consumption.
Preliminary estimates indicate that these tronds continued into 1988, with
private savings rising to 17.2S of GNP, but private investment equal to only
152. This strategy may have made sense during the recession years, when
aggregate demand was falling, the private sector was reluctant to invest, and
a public sector stimulus was required. With the recovery now in progress, -
however, there will be substantial comnetition between the public and private
sectors fur investment funds.  Unless the public sector does a better job of
mobilizing its own resources, the competition for investable funds will result
in high interest rates, a crowding out of the private sector, and a constraint
on future private sector investments.

1.6      In fact, between 1983 and 1987 there has beeTF substantial progress in
reducing the overall public sector deficit from 9X of GNP to 2.61. In 1987
the deficit was smaller than public sector investment for the first time in
four years. The major factors behind the smaller deficit were (a) a
substantial increase in the tax ratio, and (b) lower than planned investment
expenditures. (As explained in the following paragraph, investment
expenditure needs to increase substantially if future growth targets are to be
met.) The tax effort in 1987 rose nearly 2 percentage points to 12.2Z of GNP
as a result of both the 1986 tax reform package and an expansion of the tax
base, particularly imports. In 1988, however, the public sector deficit
appears to have risen to 3.42 of GNP, and the tax effort declined to 112 of
GNP.
Future Growth
2.7      Present Bank projections suggest an average rate of growth of 5.92
for the 1989-92 period, provided that a good domestic policy environment is
maintained, and the external environment remains favorable. As shown in
Table 2, this growth will require a 3.5? growth rate in agriculiure, and an 82
growth rate in industry. The overall investment rate required is 222. An
investment rate of this magnitude, however, is considerably higher than the



4-
level of 182 achieved in 1988, and will require raising domestic savings rates
from 17X to 192 of GNP. Even this projection requires a considerable macro-
economic adjustment effort, with an implied marginal sevings rate of 362 and a
growth rate of private consumption of only 4.52. Given a population growth
rate of 2.4Z, this means holding down per capita private consumption growth to
about 22 per annum, while the economy continues to grow at close to 62. These
targets of savings, investmenti and overall growth will only be achieved if a
policy framework is maintained that promotes efficient investment and growth
in both the public and private sectors, and begins to address the urgent
problems of rural and urban poverty.

1.8      Finencn  fap.  Only a relatively small portion of the increased'
investment can be financed from foreign sources, given the heavy existing debt
burden and the relatively reduced access to foreign capital. The projections
indicate a current account deficit of 2.42 of-GNP during the 1989-92 period.
This level of current deficit allows for a gradual reduction of the relative
debt burden. Although the absolute size of the debt Increases from $29
billion (at the end of 1988) to $33 billion by the end of 1992, in relative
terns it declines from 72Z to 572 of GNP (see Table 3). Likewise, the debt
service ratio declines from 33Z to 232 over the same period. However, this
scenario is possible only if there is a substantial inflow of long-term
capital. An inflow of $2.2 billion of new lending is required annually, of
which about $1.5 billion has been identified, and an additional $700 million
must be found lidentified as anew money" in Table 3). This new money
requirement will have to be met by increased official lending from bilateral
and multilateral sources, andlor from new money covmitments from private
banks. Even so. the current account-deficit projected is less than the total.
interest paid on foreign debt, so that the net resource transfer remains
negative throughout the period.

Structulal Le'forms
1.9      At the eote of the Government's new economic strategy are comprehen-
sive structural reforms to increase economic efficiency by stimulating private
sector initiative and activity. In the context of the Bank's economic and
sector pdlicy dialogue, these reformss(ere supported by the US$300 million
Economic Recovery Lcbn (ERKL, approved in March 1987 and cofinanced with
US$540 million from OECF and the Japan Eximb#nk, and folloved by the US$200
million Refor  Program for Gov6inment Corpotations Loan,.approved in June
1988.
V  E -  
1.10     The structural, reform programb suppoted by Bank operations address
fundamentsl problems which have been outstanding atd unzeesolved fot-j many years
"and whose satisfFctory resolution is considered etsential for2accelerating..
economic recovety.  The structuial reforms-have also been.empha4ized by DMF
The programs includet                                                .
Tax Reforms.  Measur's already taken include a reduction in marginal
income tax rates and4 in the number of exemptions, v4thdrawal of
export duties,ia broaden#ig of the sales tax base, and,a restructur-
.ing of the excise and import duties.  Tax reforms were com*'eted with
the introductlon of a value added tax on January 4, 1988.  However,
despite these improvements, revenue developments in 1988 suggest that
revenue collection and enforsement remain ,serious problems.
(b)  Trade k2licy Reform.  The thrust of reforms in this area has been to
reduce distortions by  removing quantitative import restrictions
(QIRt) sand substantially reducing ttke level, of duties on dutiable
items.  Between May 1986 and April I988, QIRs were removed on 1,232
items covering about lOS of total imports.  In addition, the
Government has agreed to review the 637 items which eemain
controlled, with a view toward replacing quantitative restrictions
with additional tariff protection.
(c)  Ref9rm of the Government Financial Institutions (GFIs).  In the past,
the GFIs have suffered from outside interference in lending deci-
sions, the undertaking of costly government credit programs without
reimbursement, lack if internal controls and auditing, poor manage-
ment practices in terms of lending decisions and portfolio manage-
ment, and excessive size and diversity of functions.  At the same
time, their special position allowed them unlimited use of government
deposits, exemptions from taxes and access to government guaranteed
borrowings. In the context of ERL, the Government undertook a reform
program centering on the rehabilitation of the Philippine National
Bank (PNB) and the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), the two
largest government-owned financial institutions. During 1986, the
Government, recognizing the de facto insolvency of these two institu-
tions, arranged a transfer of all their nonperforming assets of P 10
million or more each to the Asset Privatization Trust (APT) for
workout, and relieved them of the corresponding liabilities.
Institutional strengthening plans were also adopted at the same tine.



In the case of DBP, the financial restructuring has resum.ted in a
reduction in its total assets from P 74 billion to about
P 10 billion. PNB's financial restructuring plan involved a
reduction of its assets from P 79 billion to P 26 billion. The GFI
reform program also lays the groundwork for future reform of the
Social Security System (SSS), the Government Service Insurance System
(GSIS), Philguarantee and the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) by
undertaking detailed policy studies of these institutions. In
addition, of the six commercial banks taken over by the Government
because of their weak financial position, two banks have been fully
and two partially privatized; full privatization of all the six banks
is envisaged under ERL.
(d) Reform of Ron-Financial Government Corporations. The reforms of non-
financial Government Corporations (GCs) establish a policy and
institutional framework to reduce, limit and rationalize government
activities using the corporate form, and institute improvements in
the efficiency and effectiveness of retained GCs in order to reduce
gradually the heavy burden they impose on the economy. The main
elements of the program are: (a) enunciation of a policy framework
governing the establishment and operation of GCs; (b) a program of
privatization, consolidation, conversion to private non-profit
status, transfer to departments or abolition of GCs; and (c) an
institutional framework for improved operations and monitoring of the
corporations remaining in the public sector. As of end-April 1988,
privatisation of 109 of the 296 public corporations had already been
approved, and decisions taken to close 58 GC8. A Cabinet-level moni-
toring organization has also been established and corporate plans
covering key performance targets drawn up for five major
corporations.
(e) Agricultural Sector Policy Reforms. The politically powerful and
sensitive export monopolies in the sugar and coconut subsectors have
been dismantled and other related reforms completed, including
removal of restrictions on new investments in coconut milling, the
lifting of the ban on copra exports, and the removal of export duties
on coconut products. In addition, steps have been taken to eliminate
the special levy on fertilizer, and reduce taxes on pesticides. The
National Food Authority's monopoly on corn and rice imports has been
abolished and its retail activities phased out. These changes have
reduced governmental intervention in trading and investment
decisions, and contributed to improved production incentives and
higher rural incomes.
1.11     In addition, the Governrent has taken steps to accelerate the pace of
land reform. The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program, approved by Congress
in June 1988, will extend land reform to areas not covered under previous
legislation. The pace of implementation is expected to be slow given the wide
scope of the program and the need for supporting services. The program is
expected to be funded from budgetary allocations, revenues from the sale of
government assets and external financing.

IMF Relations
1.12     The last Standby Agreement with the IMF expired in August 1988.  The
Philippine authorities and the IMF staff have recently agreed on the content
of a new program supported by a three-year Extended Fund Facility amounting to
about $0.9 billion plus a contingency facility of $0.4 billion. A new
agreement vith IMP is also an important prerequisite for additional
reschedulings from the Paris Club. The new program includes steps designed,
inter alia, to control monetary expansion and inflation, substantially
increase public savings, accelerate progress in trade liberalization, and
ensure the continuation of a competitive exchange rate. In addition, IMF
program will support the various structural reforms, including those for the
financial sector laid out in this operation, and the refor li previously agreed
between the Bank and the Government in the context of the overnment
Corporations Reform Loan and the Economic Recovery Loan.
1.13     The macro economic framework currently proposed by tHF is consistent
with the Bank's own projections for the future. The proposed program is
designed to support a growth rate of GNP in excess of 6? per year, with
inflation averaging about 6-7? per year. Specifically, for the period 1988-92
the proposed agreement calls for:
- a decline in the public sector deficit from 3.4Z of GNP to 2.32;
a- n increase in public sector investment from 3.4? to 5.8?;
- an increase in the collection and enforcement efforts so that tax
revenues equal 13.2Z of GNP in 1992, compared to 11.2? in 1988;
- the removal of further restrictions on imports of certain capital and
intermediate goods; and
- the increase in base money to be held to 132 in 1989 and 1990, a rate
consistent with an inflation rate of 6-7X.
II. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
A. Overview
2.1      As of year-end 1986, assets of the financial system totaled P 724
billion, representing an increase from 1980 of 131? in nominal terms but a
decline of 28? in real terms. The major components of the system, their
nominal size, percentage distribution in 1980 versus 1986, and nominal growth
rates are summarized in Table 4 below.

2.2      CBP.  The relative importance of CBP, as indicated by the volume of
its assets, must be interpreted with care since many assets of CBP are merely
book entries. For example, CBP assets include an item called Revaluation of
International Reserves which in fact represents losses incurred by CBP in swap
and forward cover operations entered into in the past. Likewise, the accumu-
lated interest expenses and issuance and servicing costs of CBP securities and
open market instruments like CB bills and Reverse Repurchase Agreements are
also carried in the books as assets.  It appears that as much as half of CBP's
assets may have this special character.  If these items are eliminated, CBP's
share of system assets would be reduced from 432 to 28X.
2.3      Banking System.  In light of the caveat in the preceding paragraph,
the banking system is by far the largest component of the financial sector,
accounting for more than half of its total assets. It comprises commercial
banks, thrift institutions, rural banks and specialized government banks.
2.4      Commercial banks dominate the banking system, accounting for 832 of
its total assets. Following the failure of one commercial bank in 1987, there
are now 29 banks, of which four are foreign and one (PNB, still the biggest)2J
is government-owned. Eight banks are licensed as universal banks, a
classification that allows them to engage in many near-banking activities such
as those associated with investment banks, leasing companies and finance
21 In compliance with ERL, PNB is taking steps to start its privatization
later in 1989.

companies. Since the proposed financial sector adjustment loan is primarily
concerned with the commercial banking sector, it is discussed in more detail
in paragraphs 2.8-2.11.
2.5      Nonbank Institutions.  The nonbanks include insurance companies,
pension funds, investment institutions, trust operations and others. Their
assets amount to P 113 billion, or 162 of the financial system's assets. The
most important are insurance companies with assets of P 75 billion and finance
and investment companies (with assets of P 24 billion). Regulated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commissioner of Insurance, as
appropriate, nonbanks are independent of CBP.
2.6      The Securities Market.  Though there are two operating stock
exchanges, the Manila Stock Exchange and the Makati Stock Exchange, the
equities market in the Philippines has been very small relative to the size of
the financial system as a whole. At the end of 1987, there were 136 listed
companies with market capitalization of P 61.1 billion. As for the corporate
debt securities market, at year end-1987, there were P 3.4 billion registered
commercial paper issues but only P ..2 billion were sold in the market with
the remaining being privately placed. The government securities market is far
more active, with the national government bond issues totalling about P 34.0
billion and those of government controlled corporations and CBP being about
P 4.0 billion and P 7.4 billion, respectively. The largest issued and
actively traded government securities are T-bills, which had a total of
P 107.5 billion outstanding as of end-1987.
2.7      One of the principal reasons for the small size of the equities
market in the Philippines is that its developmental function is not clearly
understood. The recently completed Financial Sector Study (para. 2.13),
undertaken by the Bank has proposed that a major study be undertaken to
identify and remove impediments to, and encourage, securities market
development. The proposed study should examine all relevant rules and
regulations, and also review the present functions and responsibilities of SEC
which appear to be too diversified to be effectively handled by a single
institution. The recommendation has been accepted by the Government and steps
are being taken to ' rm the study group. Major reforms of the securities
market and possible role for the BanklIFC in the reform process have to await
the findings of the study. Quick results are not expected because SEC, which
is an autonomous and key institution, is currently beset with serious internal
problems which could take some time to resolve.
B. The Commercial Banking Sector
2.8      Until the beginning of this century, all banks set up in the
Philippines were branches of foreign banks. The first Filipino commercial
bank, PNB, was set up in 1916 and the first private bank in 1938. The pace of
banking development quickened, and systematized, as a result of passage of
landmark legislations in 1948 and 1949 when the General Banking Act and the
Central Bank Act were passed. The period 1950-70 was characterized by the
dynamic growth of banking, as the number of banks quadrupled and the ratio of
commercial bank assets and deposits to GNP rose rapidly. During this period,
commercial banks had easy entry into the industry, and 27 new banks were



- 11 -
created. By early 1970s, the regulatory authorities became concerned with the
situation created by the rapid but haphazard growth. The banking sector
reforms of 1972-73 put an end to new bank entry, raised minimum capital
requirements, reduced the categories of financial institutions, encouraged
bank mergers and inflow of foreign equity capital, and expanded and tightened
the supervisory and regulatory powers of CBP.
2.9      Commercial banks in the Philippines are much smaller than those in
other Asian countries; the two largest Philippine banks ranked 82nd and 99th
in a recent survey of the 200 biggest banks in Asia. Within the country no
single bank has a dominating position; the largest bank, the government-owned
PNB, accounts for 152 of total banking assets. The three largest banks
account for 41Z and the five largest banks account for 52Z of total assets
respectively. Thus, the largest banks in the Philippines are relatively not
very big. Conversely, the smallest banks are very small indeed: the average
total assets and capital of the three smallest banks were US$92.0 million and
US$7.4 million equivalent, respectively, as of September 30, 1987. The number
of banks and the relatively small size of the biggest banks indicate that
concentration in the banking industry is not excessive or a problem as such.
This is also indicated by the relatively low Herfindahl Index (0.1).3/
2.10     The commercial banking system managed total assets of P 248 billion
(about US$12 billion equivalent) as at the end of 1986. Total assets have
grown at an average annual rate of 10.3? since 1960 (in nominal terms),
considerably slower than the average annual growth rate of 30.5? during
1970-75 and 21.1? during 1975-80. Total loans and investments likewise grew
at a much slower pace of 3.2? per annum during 1980-86 compared with 28? and
24.32 per annum during 1970-75 and 1975-80. respectively.
2.11     In real terms, the banking system has undergone a tremendous contrac-
tion: total assets contracted by 442 during 1980-86 and loans and investments
in the private and public sectors contracted by 63Z and 33?, respectively,
during the same period. Large write-offs were taken during this period,
particularly during 1984-85. By 1986, the worst of the dislocations in the
real sectors were over, and reconstruction had started. With increasing,
stability and improvement in the real sectors, helped by good profit margins
in 1986-87, the health of the banking sector has steadily improved. As an
indication, the banks' capital adequacy ratio has improved in recent years:
loan volumes contracted sharply in 1984-86 while the bank margins improved
substantially, resulting in improved capital-to-assets and capital-to-loans
ratios in 1986 and 1987.
C. Problems Facing the Banking Sector
Overview
2.12     The sharp contraction of the economy during the first half of the
eighties had its inevitable impact on the banking system and highlighted its
weaknesses and fragility. Since 1980, three commercial banks had to be
closed; several others needed rescue operations, including the government

concentration.



- 12 -
owned PNB. (Tens of small thrift and rural banks also failed.) In the wake
of this distress and pressure on the banking system, there has also been a
spate of legal suits against CBP and its personnel, hampering CBP's role as
the supervisor/regulator of the financial system. The present institutional
arrangement for safeguarding the interests of insured depositors have also
proved inadequate. In addition, the axpected increase in the demand for
investment credit has also prompted concern about the absence ef an institu-
tional framework for the mobilization and provision of long-term funds for
investment purposes.
2.13     Given the obvious problems and concerns stated above, the Bank
decided irn 1987 to undertake an overall financial sector study. The study was
endorsed and actively supported by the Government. Field work for the study
was completed in November 7.987, and the report finalized and issued in August
1988 (Philippinest Financial Sector Study, Report No. 7177-PH dated
August 23, 1988). The Financial Sector Study (FSS) undertook a comprehensive
review of the present financial system, concentrating on the commercial
banking segment, how it has been impacted by the major economic and financial
events of the 1980s, its present health, its supervision and regulation, legal
issues affecting bank supervision and regulation, and institutional arrange-
ments for the mobilization and provision of long-term credit and in that
context the role of the GovernmentlCBP in credit allocation.
2.14     The FSS identified the following as four critical problem areas:
(a)  Supervision and regulpcion, including the governing legal framework;
(b)  Institutional arrangements for the protection of insured depositors'
(c) High intermediation costs and lack of effective competition; and
(d) Institutional arrangements for the mobilization and provision of
long-term capital.
Supervision and Regulation of Commercial Banks
2.15     The FSS found that the problems in the area of bank supervision and
regulation arise because of (i) inadequate legal framework, (ii) inadequate
supervisory and regulatory guidelines and procedures, and (iii) CBP's
involvement in liquidation of closed banks.
2.16     Legal Framework.  The Honetary Board (MB)41  has in the past found it
difficult to act firmly and quickly to help save banks in distress or to act
against those which violated its rules and regulations. This is because the
legal framework is flawed in that:
(a) The law does not provide for clear and transparent guidelines
regarding the procedures governing emergency loans to banks in
distress, with the result that the procedures appear ad hoc and
lacking consistent application, a situation which has led to several
legal suits alleging CBP's arbitrariness and bad faith.
4/ The Monetary Board is CBP's board of directors. It is chaired by the
Governor of CBP who is also its chief executive officer.



-13-
(b) The law has proved inadequate and inflexible in defining insolvency
of commercial banks. The current criteria used by MB are whether
(i) the liabilities of the bank exceed the realizable value of
assets, and (ii) the bank's continuance in business would involve
probable loss to the depositors. There is need for additional
criteria.
(c) The law does not provide MB with an enforcement instrument of inter-
mediate force to be used in a process of graduated response well
before it becomes necessary to invoke maximal force such as commenc-
ing liquidation proceedings.
(d) The present law on deposit secrecy hinders bank supervisors in
detecting and countering in a timely fashion malpractices associated
with loans to bank directors, officers, stockholders and related
interests (DOSRI loans) or insider abuses, which are generally
believed responsible for many bank failures.
(e) The present law does not provide sufficient protection to CBP super-
visory staff against civil suits which are brought against them for
actions taken in the performance of their official duties. Because
of extensive legal fees and potential awards affecting their personal
financial resources, this lack of protection is now having a dissua-
sive impact on their performance.
(f)  The iaw obliges PDIC to rely on criminal suits against bank directors
and officials accused of wrongdoing; these are more difficult and
time consuming to prosecute than civil suits.
2.17     Supervisory Procedures.  In its supervisory procedures, CBP is
hampered by inadequate reporting requirements, absence of firm rules on loan
loss provisions, abuse of trust accounts, and inadequate accounting principles
and standards used in the preparation of financial statements:
(a) Reporting Requirements. Despite the comprehensiveness of reports
that banks submit to CBP, the data collected do not reflect the
significant changes in the financial system that have taken place in
the last few years. In addition, the data cannot be easily manipu-
lated electronically, thus limiting their full and timely analysis
and reducing the ability of staff to undertake continuous off-site
monitoring.
(b) Provisioning for Loan Losses. In the absence of-firm rules for loan
loss provisions, CBP staff have had to rely on their own assessment
of the quality of a bank's assets in judging the adequacy of provi-
sions. This is time consuming and, more seriously, has at times led
to disagreements between CBP staff and bank managements.
(c) Trust Accounts. Trust accounts have increased substantially in
recent years, totalling P 32.3 billion or more than 23Z of total
deposits by end-1986. There is evidence to suggest that in their
trust activities, several banks have gone beyond the traditional and



- 14 -
proper fiduciary role of assisting clients to invest and manage their
long-term savings. Indications are that trust accounts are being
used to engage in normal banking activities on an off-balance-sheet
basis, with serious tax and reserve requirement implications. This
not only leads to a loss of government revenue but also distorts
performance indicators, thus affecting supervision of the banking
system.
(d) Transparency and Consistency in Financial Reporting. Though
generally accepted accounting principles governing the preparation
and publication of banks' annual accounts as applied in the
Philippines have been improved in recent years, there still is scope
for considerable progress with regard to consistency and trans-
parency. The present standards are deficient in specific areas:
definition of materiality; the definition, classification and report-
ing of renegotiated and past due loans; the treatment of trust
accounts; and the definition, treatment and reporting of specific as
well as general provisions for loan losses.
2.18     CBP's Involvement in Liquidation of Banks.  In practice CBP officials
(from the Supervision Department) act as receivers and liquidators of closed
banks because persons from the private sector refuse to accept this high risk
responsibility. There are two adverse results of thist (i) the time and
attention of the Supervision Department devoted to liquidation related work
acts as a serious detraction from its main function of supervision and
regulation, and (ii) the liquidation related work exposes CBP to charges of
conflict of interest with resultant litigation with its own consequences.
Protection of Insured Depositors
2.19     Protection to depositors is provided by the Philippine Deposit
Insurance Corporation (PDIC).  It was created in 1963 and is mandated by law
to insure deposit liabilities of all banks in the country; presently the maxi-
mum coverage per depositor is P 40,000. PDIC's authorized capitalization is
P 2 billion, but only P 930 million has been paid-in. On the other hand, it
has actually paid out P 3 billion to insured depositors of failed banks but
still owed about P 2.5 billion in unpaid claims as of end-1988. In addition,
it has indentified potential claims amounting to P 1.5 billion. In the
absence of adequate capitalization, PDIC has met the claims of insured
depositors by borrowings from CBP, which amounted to P 2.8 billion as of end-
1988 (inclusive of accrued but unpaid interest). If account is taken of the
amount still owed to insured depositors of failed banks, the payable to CBP:
estimated obligations arising from operating banks that apparently are
insolvent, the appraised value of subrogated claims, and other measures the
Government is contemplating to reduce the burden of claims on it, PDIC
estimates that it needs about P 4 billion in new cash contributions to its
capital to meet the present deficiency and leave it with a reasonable positive
net worth.
2.20     As is clear from the preceding paragraph, undercapitalization is a
serious problem facing PDIC. But there are also other problems. By acting as
conservator, receiver and liquidator, CBP deprives PDIC of any say in the
affairs of a failing bank even though PDIC is responsible for paying deposi-



- X5. -.
tors after a bank closure. The present practice also gives rise to allega-
tions of conflict of interest against CBP. Although it has statutory powers
to conduct inspections and impose sanctions, PDIC relies entirely on CBP for
these functions. PDIC is also authorized to realize the assets of institu-
tions closed for liquidation. However, in practice, if PDIC were to carry out
these functions, it would be severely hampered because it does not have enough
specialized staff for this purpose. In other words. there is an urgent need
for undertaking a major financial and institutional strengthening program for
PDIC.
Intermediation Costs
2.21     The average intermeoiation cost (AIC), which can be broken down into
bank margin (i.e. operating costs and profits), taxes, and reserve costs
(including the cost attributable to the requirement to lend a certain percen-
tage of a bank's loanable funds to agriculture and beneficiaries of agricul-
tural reform) was high in 1983-86, ranging from 72 to 1OZ. Indications are
that intermediation margins continued to be high in 1987. Table 5 provides a
breakdown of AIC into its components:

2.22     Profitability and Competition.  Though there is no undue concentra-
tion in the Philippine banking system as such (para. 2.9), the gross earnings
margin (GEM) 5/ as a percentage of total assets has been high, averaging 5.62
during 1984-86; indications are that it remained high in 1987 as well. Since
the figure for GEM quoted hare is average for the industry, some banks earn
even higher margins. The high margins despite the presence of many banks
indicate a lack of effective competition. At present the commercial banking
system includes many small, weak banks with high operating costs. Given the
desire and need for the more efficient banks to rebuild their balance sheets
after having taken large write-offs in earlier years and faced with relatively
slack demand for credit during 1986-87, the stronger banks in effect opted to

- 16 -
earn a high margin by pricing their products and services with reference to
the cost structure of the less efficient banks, rather than attempt to gain
market share by lowering prices and driving the weaker banks out of business.
The CBP seems to have helped in this process by sustaining the weak, banks for
unduly long periods. It should also be noted that empirical studies
undertaken in the Philippines suggest that an expansion of the small banks'
size could lead to lower costs. There is need, therefore, to formulate and
follow policies that would result in more effective competition. On the one
hand, the system should be allowed to weed out, in a controlled and systematic
way, the inefficient and weak banks (ease of exit); on the other hand, the
Monetary Board also needs to be flexible in granting new banking licenses, to
signal that the stronger and more efficient banks would not forever be allowed
immvznity from new competition (ease of entry). Opening of new bank branches
also needs to be made easier by leaving the basic business decision to open a
branch to the bank concerned.
2.23     Taxation on Financial Intermediation.  Two taxes are imposed on the
banking industry-- the 52 Gross Receipts Tax (GRT), and a 20S withholding tax.
The GRT is levied on all bank receipts (including both interest and capital
gains). The GRT revenues amounted to P 964 million, P 873 million and P 767
million in 1985, 1986 and 1987 respectively, declining as a percentage of
total revenues from 1.42 in 1985 to 0.72 in 1987. It is estimated that during
1983-86, GRT added 73-99 basis points to average intermediation costs. As for
the 202 withholding tax, it is levied on deposit interest income from all but
deposits of less than seven days. It is not refundable even if the computed
income tax falls short of the amount withheld. This causes some distortion
relative to an efficient income tax because banks are often in the position
where their computed income tax liability falls below the amount of their
withholding tax. It has also led to an undesirable practice among banks:
they now prefer to invest their excess funds in short-term deposits of less
than seven days on a rollover basis, regardless of what their actual liquidity
needs are.  This practice also makes monitoring of the banking system
difficult to the extent that it may lead to overstatement of the actual
liquidity in the system.
2.24     Mnother contributor to high intermediation costs is the low rate of
compensation, 42, paid on liquidity reserve requirements which are relatively
hight the reserve requirements are 212 on short-term deposits, 5? on deposits
of two years or more, and 1 on interbank deposits; the average works out to
be about 182 of all deposits. (Of the total reserve requirements, 132 of
deposit liabilities are held in the form of deposits with CBP; the remaining
are in the form of currency held in banks' own vaults and in the form of
certain eligible securities). It should also be noted that in a variable
interest rate regime, the fixed rate paid on reserves means that the
opportunity cost (or revenue foregone) of these reserves to the banks may
fluctuate widely. Thus the below-market interest paid on reserves added 3.82
to average intermediation costs in 1984, but declined to 1.62 in 1986 because
the market rates had declined substantially.
2.25     Legal Framework Governing Debt Recovery and Insolvencies.  To some
extent, the laws and regulations governing debt recovery and insolvencies also
contribute to increase bank margins although it is not possible to quantify
their effects. An example is the substantial time taken to resolve cases



- 17 -
involving real-estate mortgage (REM) foreclosures and reorganizations, a
situation which also makes banks reluctant to engage in long-term secured
lending. Instead, the banks lend on a renewable short-term basis, preferring
to have the assured right of not renewing a loan rather than the security of a
mortgage which may be difficult to foreclose.
2.26-   Insolvency and reorganization laws as currently constituted fail to
safeguard the going concern value of the affected enterprises while also
protecting the rights of creditors for three principal reasons. First, the
legislation is not explicit and provides no clear guidelines and standards for
rehabilitation. Secondly, doubts exist about the powers of SEC, the agency
responsible for appointing a receiver to prepare a reorganization plan for
SEC's approval. Third, the courts' authority to affect the rights of secured
creditors is uncertain.
2.27     Three other legal issues relating to debt recovery are problematics
(a) the time taken for foreclosure of a chattel mortgage is too long; (b) as
regards priorities of claims in distribution, the number of preferences (14)
is excessive and (c) the law governing the creation and perfection of security
interests is overly complex and difficult to enforce.
Mobilization and Delivery of Term Funds
2.28     CBP/Government Role in Credit Allocation. The fourth major problem
area relates to the availability and delivery of term credit. Until recently,
the Government/CBP played a direct role in credit allocation in sectors
considered by it to have prioritys it did so by designing credit programs and
subsequently assuming responsibility for obtaining funding for them and their
implementation. It is estimated that these programs which cover both agricul-
ture and industry, accounted for about 52 to 72 of total banking sector loans
outstanding at the end of 1986.  Most of the agricultural programs also
involved subsidies.  The subsidy provided to the end users of funds under 13
major agricultural sector, credit programs for which data are available
amounted to at least P 3.4 billion during 1981-86 in the form of lower than
market interest rates and uncollected loans. As a percentage of the anr.ual
budget deficit during this period, subsidies on the 13 programs ranged firom a
low of 2% in 1986 to a high of 82 in 1983. The cost of these programs to the
Government was substantially higher than the amount of P 3.4 billion stated
above if the following additional items were taken into considerations
interest rate subsidies and uncollected loans for the smaller programs for
which data are not available; administrative expenses of the implementing
agencies including CBP; and government equity in failed rural banks and the
tax exemptiorns granted to them. Despite these subsidies in the past, the
trend in government-sponsored credit programs in recent years has been to move
towards elimination of subsidies; for all major programs, the on-lending rates
are now market oriented.
2.29     Nonetheless some problems continue.  Despite recent efforts to
consolidate government-directed credit programs (22 programs have been
consolidated under the Comprehensive Agriculture Loan Fund, CALF),
fragmentation of both the programs and implementing agencies continues. The
financing of various sectors has been approached in a piecemeal fashion with a
specific-target lending orientation. Many of the programs have inconsistent,



- 18 -
duplicating and overlapping objectives. Institutional fragmentation has also
resulted partly because the'resource-providing agencies had their own
preferences as to,credit delivery institutions.  The proliferation of
uncoordinated programs his been accompanied by a wide range of on-lending
rates charged to the final borrowers. In many cases, these rates reflect
neither the cost of funds in the economy nor the stated priorities of the
Government. Above all, CBP continues to be involved in the management of
credit allocation programs.
2.30     Institutional Arrangements for Providing Long-Term Credit.  While the
banking system has been able to meet most short-term credit needs, the provi-
sion of long-term credit has been inadequate. Indeed, the most significant
gap in the current financing system is in the provision of long-term credit.
With the shrinking of lending activity by DBP and PNB concurrent with their
rehabilitation program, the specialized government institutions have not made
a substantial contribution to the supply of term credit in the last two years.
Their share in the total credit made available to the manufacturing sector,
for example, declined sharply from a high of 43Z in 1984 to only about 2% in
1986. As for the commercial banking system, the short-term nature of their
lending and their caution became even more pronounced in recent years with the
turmoil the financial system went through. The limited amount of term lending
made by the commercial banks is usually through Oroll-overg of short term
loans. The short-term horizon of lenders and investors is not surprising in
view of the interest rate and exchange rate volatility during the last decade.
Term transformation has not been accomplished to any significant degree
because the banks have been unwilling to assume the liquidity risk. This has
resulted. in a situation wherein the main sources of medium- and long-term
funding in the Philippines have been the government directed credit programs
described earlier. Instead of lending from resources raised from the market,
the banks merely acted as lending conduits for funds borrowed by, the
Government from foreign sources or to a lesser extent, provided from-the
budget.
2.31     The situation is expected to worsen as the demand for investment
credit increases with the growth of the overall economy. The current
constraint on the availability of long-ter credit reflects a lack of adequate
arrangements regarding credit, interest rate and liquidity risks. The credit
risk in long-term lending in itself is substantial, and commercial banks will
be willing to assume such risk only if arrangements are made to relieve them
of another accompanying risk i.e., the liquidity risk. Given the liquidity
crises of the past, banks are unwilling to assume the liquidity risk inherent
in term transformation, and the present liability maturities are not, nor are
they expected in the foreseeable future to be, long enough to enable the banks
to lend long-term.
2.32     However, some domestic long-term resources are available in the
system from institutional savers like insurance companies (including SSS and
GSIS) and pension funds.  It is estimated that gross premium receipts in 1986
amounted to P 5.8 billion and P 5.7 billion for private and public insurance
companies, respectively. Also, it is generally believed, and confirmed by the
institutions, that the annual increments to investable funds are quite large.
For pension funds, the estimate for incremental funds mobilized in 1986 is at
least P 600 million. These institutions are also willing to invest long-term



- 19 -
in the private sector if suitable opportunities are identified, i.e., they are
willing to assume the maturity risk. As for the interest rate risk, the end
users have already shown their willingness to assume it by borrowing on a
variable rate basis. What is needed is to develop a financially viable
institutional arrangement to bring the providers and users of long-term funds
together.
D. Financial Sector - Macro Linkages
2.33     The major challenges facing the Philippines at this juncture are the
mobilization of more savings, after years of per capita income declines, and
the channeling of those savings into domestic investment. The structural
reforms of the past few years have reversed the perverse ircentive regime of
the past decade; however, the responsiveness of the economy to those
incentives has been slow because of the fragility of the financial sector
through iwhich financial savings are to be mobilized and channelled.
2.34     As brought out earlier, the triage and emergency care of troubled
financial institutions has been largely accomplished. What remains to be done
is to put the financial sector on a firm enough footing to support the
significant shifts in resource allocation which the economy must undertake in
response to the new array of incentives put in place with the stabilization
and reform programs of recent years. In addition, the sector must be relied
on to mobilize a large quantity of private savings, and to intermediate funds
at reasonable cost to new productive activities. Many of the financial sector
reforms supported by the proposed operation as discussed in the following
chapter are aimed at restoring the health and efficiency of the banking
sector, enabling it to be more competitive and responsive to the needs of the
real sectors. The proposed reform program will, above all, enhance confidence
in the sector by reducing the potential for financial mismanagement which had
previously characterized it.
2.35     At present, the government is forced to finance its internal debt at
relatively high rates, setting a high minimum benchmark rate, crowding out the
private sector and limiting available maturities. Better supervision and
regulation of the banking sector will serve to limit the future incidence of
non-performing assets and, combined with reforms to ease entry and exit in the
banking sector resulting in increased effective competition, will reduce
intermediation costs. This should enable the Government to finance its debt
at lower cost. Ultimate reduction in the size of the domestic debt in
relation to GNP will also require vigorous overall economic growth in addition
to reduced debt servicing costs. The latter can be the expected result of
greater and more efficient savings mobilization by the financial sector and.
greater competition in the intermediation process. Greater stability in the
financial sector more generally will help restore confidence and lead to
higher investments and growth. With increased confidence, there should also
be positive impact on direct foreign investment. Ultimately, the burden on
government of having to finance the fiscal and current account deficits will
be eased and a larger proportion of domestic savings will find its way into
productive sectors.



-  20 -
2.36     The linkage between financial sector reform and macroeconomic manage-
ment runs both ways. Successful financial reform makes the task of macro-
management easier and presents policymakers with more favorable options.
Conversely, financial reforms cannot succeed if macro-management is not
prudent.  For this reason, collaboration between the Bank and IW  is an
essential ingredient of this operatior.. Some of the objectives that the
proposed operation seeks to promote with respect to mobilization of long term
resources and intermediation costs require the continued vigilance of the
monetary and fiscal authorities to keep the macro aggregates under control and
avoid the imposition of policy distortions which could adversely affect the
financial sector. Close collaboration between the Bank and IMP is a prominent
feature of this operation (see paras. 1.12 and 6.1).
III. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM
A. Perspective and Objectives
The Perspective
3.1      The Bank's involvement with the Government's efforts to reform the
financial sector began in 1979-80, when, together with iMF, the Bank undertook
a study of the financial system that focussed on its overall structure and
direction and the impact of macroeconomic policies. Its two major
recommendations were: (a) to deregulate interest rates which were, until
then, tightly controlled; and (b) to introduce universal banking to reduce the
institutional fragmentation of the financial system, which was until then
operating on the basis of functional specialization. Implementation of these
recommendations was initiated in March 1980 when the country's banking laws
were amended to permit the adoption of a universal banking system. The recom-
mendation to deregulate interest rates was implemented in several stages.
Starting in 1980, ceilings on various categories of bank lending and deposit
rates were eased and then progressively removed. The last deposit rate
ceiling (on deposits with maturity of two years or less) was removed in mid-
1981, and the last lending ceiling (on short-term loans) on January 1, 1983.
Before the deregulation of interest rates, the banks had been circumventing
the ceiling through a proliferation of additional charges and fees. The
change thus brought greater transparency to the system. Interest rates are
now, in the absence of regulation, determined by the interaction of supply and
demand. They are substantially positive in real terms.
3.2      Financial sector reforms were taken a step further in the context of
ERL in 1986-87.  However, ERL's main focus was an adjustment and stabilization
of the overall economy; it dealt with only the most pressing of the financial
sector problems: the rehabilitation of the two largest financial institu-
tions--PNB and DBP (para. 1.7(c)). The Government also agreed at the same
time to reduce its role in the financial sector as a matter of policy. With
the rehabilitation and financial restructuring of PNB and DBP substantially
completed, the stage was set to tackle by far the single largest segment of
the financial system--the commercial banking sector. The PSS was, therefore,
undertaken in November 1987, concentrating on this sector and related issues.
The reform program discussed in this section has been designed based on the
findings of FSS as outlined in the preceding chapter.



ObJectives of the Adiustment Program
3.3      Building upon the economic and sector work undertaken In the last few
years and drawing the necessary lessons from FSS, the Bank has worked closely
with CBP and the Department of Finance (DOF) to develop a program of financial
sector adjustment measures. The broad objective of the proposed adjustment
measures is to strengthen the financial system, particularly the commercial
banking segment. More specifically, the reform program aims to:
(a) strengthen the supervision and regulatory framework for commercial banks;
(b) improve the institutional arrangement for depositor protection; (c) reduce
intermediation costs in the banking system; and (d) improve the institutional
framework for the mobilization and delivery of long-term credit. It is
expected that as a result there will be enhanced confidence in the financial
system.
3.4      The program involves implementation of specific actions to help
accomplish these objectives; some of these can be effected through administra-
tive measures while others require changes in law and, therefore, legislative
action. Bank supervision and regulation would be improved by (i) strengthen-
ing the legal and supervisory framework so as to empower CBP to take
corrective actions in a timely fashion with respect to problem banks and, if
necessary, to effect bank closures; (ii) improving the supervisory and
regulatory procedures; and (iii) separating the supervisory and regulatory
function from receivership-liquidation. Arrangements for depositor protection
would be strengthened by enlarging the role of PDIC to empower it to act as
receiver-liquidator of failing banks and strengthening it financially and
institutionally to enable it to play that role effectively. Intermediation
costs would be reduced through promotion of more effective competition,
reduction PAd elimination of certain fiscal impositions as well as improvement
of laws governing debt recovery and insolvencies. Fund mobilization and
medium- and long-term credit delivery would be enhanced through actions
involving a revamping of DBP to enable it to act essentially as a wholesaler
of long-term funds, and the elimination of CBP's role in credit allocation.
B. The Program
Bank Supervision and Regulat )n
3.5      Reforms in the Legal Framework.  The aim is to amend the laws and
regulations so that they become more effective and easier to apply in an
objective manner; there will be no additional laws and regulations. The
reforms address the problems associated with emergency loans to distressed
banks, criteria for bank receivership, cease and desist orders, insider loans,
civil suits against wrongdoers and protection for CBP staff for actions taken
in the performance of their duties:                           I
(a) Emergency Loans to Banks. The MB has formulated new guidelines to
govern emergency loans to banks in distress so as to ensure
consistency in application and predictability for the affected banks.
These guidelines provide for a maximum amount that CBP may advance to
a bank in distress. The guidelines also provide for the emergency



- 22 -
advance to be disbursed in two tranches. The first tranche, to be
disbursed shortly after a bank requests emergency assistance, shall
be equal to the value of good and easily verifiable collateral
offered by the bank or 252 of its total deposits and deposit
substitutes, whichever is less. The decision to release the second
tranche, if needed, shall take into account progress on the
implementation of selected measures for performance improvements
already agreed and after an explicit judgement has been made that the
bank is still solvent. 61 The second tranche shall be disbursed
against the security of C(i) lower quality assets that the bank may
posress, plus (ii) the personal assets of the principal shareholders
of the bank, and (iii) after the principal shareholders have agreed
to hold any conservator appointed by MB harmless from legal suits
which might be broughtWagainst him by any depositors, creditors, or
personnel of the bank.
(b) Criteria for Appointing a Receiver. To enhance CBP's ability to act
in a timely and decisive fashion, the amendments to the Central Bank
Act have provided two additional criterias (i) whether the bank is
able to meet its obligations as they mature, and (ii) whether there
is a willful violation of a cease and desist order which has become
final (see (c) below).
*c) Cease and Desist Orders. The amended Central Bank Act provides for
CBP to adopt the cease and desist order as an additional regulatory
and enforcement instrument to be used in a process of graduated
response well before it becomes necessary to invoke maximal means
such as commencing liquidation proceedings. Appropriate use of these
orders are also expected to shield CBP against the occasional
accusation that its actions are too harsh.
*d) Secrecy Law and DOSRI Loans. Given the entrenched feelings in the
Philippines in favor of the present deposit secrecy law, it is feared
that its abolition would harm the financial system by damaging inves-
tor confidence. At the same time, it is recognized that blanket
secrecy makes the task of bank supervisors unnecessarily and unduly
difficult. In order to curb insider abuse, the amended Central Bank
Act provides that when borrowings of a bank's directors, officers,
stock holders or related interest (DOSRI) exceed a threshold amount,
it shall be deemed that they have waived their rights to secrecy of
information concerning their deposits wherever held in the country.
This will allow the supervisory staff to track money flows and check
insider abuse. It vill enable the supervisory staff to trace
transactions and uncover wrong doing at an early stage.
(e) The Threat of Litisation Against CBP Staff. According to the amended
law, CBP will be authorized by law to purchase liability insurance on
behalf of staff, provide free legal counsel, and take other similar
measures.
6/ The law provides that a bank shall be closed when the Monetary Board
determines that it is insolvent.



- 23 -
3.6      Supervisory and Regulatory Procedures.  The reforms to improve and
strengthen supervisory and regulatory procedures involve the followings
(a) Reporting Requirements. CBP is undertaking, in cooperation with the
Banker's Association of the Philippines (RAP), a comprehensive review
of banks' reporting to CBP, with a view to standardize all reports
and enhance electronic manipulation of data both when the reports are
being prepared by the banks and after their receipt by CBP. Once
reporting requirements have been streamlined and their usability in a
timely fashion enhanced, greater reliance for supervision and
regulation will be placed on continuous off-site monitoring through
analysis of reports.
(b) Loan Loss Provisions. CBP is standardizing the underlying principles
of asset valuation and loan provisioning, including definitions, so
as to be applied uniformly by all banks.
(c) Trust Accounts. CBP is undertaking a detailed study of trust account
management practices, with a view to devising a set of measures to
prevent abuse.
(d) Review and Revision of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP) To improve consistency and transparency in financial
reporting, GAAP are being revised, concentrating on the definition of
materiality; the definition, classification and reporting of
renegotiated and past due loans; the treatment of trust accounts; and
the definition, treatment and reporting of specific as well as
general provision for loan losses. The proposed revisions have been
undertaken as a joint exercise by the Accounting Standards Council
(ASC) and CBP in close consultation with BAP.
Arrangements for Depositor Protection
3.7      The role of PDIC is being substantially enlarged.  In order to
clearly demarcate the functions of CBP and PDIC, the latter will be desig-
nated, by law, as the receiver in all cases of failing banks, This means that
the role of MBICBP will end as soon as it determines that the condition of a
bank has so deteriorated that a receiver/liquidator needs to be appointed.
This functional demarcation reemphasizes supervision and regulation of the
financial system as the principal responsibility of CBP. On the other hand,
as a receiver or liquidator if necessary, PDIC will have a major say in
deciding how to deal with a failing or failed bank. The new arrangement, with
its division of responsibility between (a) the conservator who reports to CBP
and whose functions would terminate upon appointment of PDIC as receiver, and
(b) PDIC, will give PDIC a key role in dealing with banks in serious
difficulty. The new law will also provide for substantially more say for PDIC
and at an earlier stage in dealing with problem banks. The new demarcation of
functions between CBP and PDIC should also at least reduce, if not eliminate,
the chances that CBP would be charged with conflict of interest and resultant
litigation.
3.8      As already provided by existing law, PDIC will have three basic
options in dealing with a failing bankt (a) make additional loans or other



- 24 -
financial assistance available to the bank for its rehabilitation; (b) pay out
the insured depositors and liquidate the bank; or (c) arrange for the sale of
the bank to another bank. As a result of the proposed reforms, explicit
criteria will be used by PDIC in deciding which course of action to take.
3.9      Since PDIC will assume the financial loss of a failed bank, it should
have the right to minimize its loss through recovery against those responsible
for the bank failure in the first instance. PDIC will, therefore, be
duthorized to bring civil suits against those individuals whose wrongful
actions contributed to the bank's failure.
3.10     PDIC cannot play the substantially enlarged role outlined above
unless it is significantly strengthened in terms of management, staffing and
capitalization. For this purpose it has prepared a detailed institutional
strengthening plan. It provides for a phased program of management and staff
strengthening (including training), changes in organization structure, and
financial strengthening (including increase in equity capital and changes in
fee structure) to assure its long-term financial viability. The institutional
strengthening plan was reviewed and agreed during negotiations. For PIDC's
financial strengthening, its paid-in capital will be increased from its
present level of P 1.0 billion to P 5 billion in a phased manner between 1989
and 1992. In the long run, to safeguard its future financial integrity, PDIC
will increase the fee it charges for its insurance service. Provision for
this has been made in the new PDIC Act now being considered by the Congress.
Intermediation Costs
3.11     To reduce intermediation costs of the commercial banking sector,
steps have been agreed to (a) increase effective competition, which is
expected to lead to lower margins; (b) reduce taxation on financial
intermediation; and (c) reduce the costs associated with debt recovery and
insolvency/reorganization process.  The reform program seeks to achieve these
through the reduction of barriers to entry and exit in the commercial banking
market, easing restrictions on opening of new bank branches, consolidation
through merger/acquisition of weak banks, reduction in taxation on financial
intermediation and improvement in the laws governing debt recovery and
insolvencies. With respect to the reduction in taxation on financial
intermediation, the Bank shares the Government'a concern that it should be
undertaken in such a way that the already difficult budgetary position is not
exacerbated.
3.12     Competition.  More effective competition is expected in the future
because the moratorium, in effect since 1971, on new bank establishment has
been lifted, the restrictions on opening of new branches have been eased, and
mergers/acquisitions of small weak banks will now be allowed/encouraged. With
respect to the last point, CBP will not in future protect weak banks for as
long as it sometimes has in the past; instead, it has adopted a policy of
encouraging some consolidation in the banking industry. While the policy of
encouraging consolidation was in some measure already in force, the policy
will now be pursued more explicitly and vigorously and the process
accelerated. To prevent the continued proliferation of very small, weak banks
with high operating costs, the most appropriate approach will be to allow
mergers/acquisitions. If private domestic investors cannot be found,



- 25 -
consideration will be given to allowing new foreign banks to participate in
this process. This policy is already in effect; in fact a new foreign bank
(Bank of Boston) was allowed to invest in a troubled bank in the second half
of 1988.
3.13     Effective competition in the future will be further encouraged as a
result of the lifting of the moratorium on the establishment of new banks.
The CBP has issued a circular announcing it.s readiness to entertain
applications for new bank licenses; the criteria and qualifications have also
been announced. This is a strong signal to existing banks that they will have
to compete more vigorously in the future. As a further measure to increase
competition, CBP has modified its policy with respect to allowing the
establishment of new bank branches. According to its new policy CBP will
encourage expansion of branches by financially sound banks in areas which it
considers not served adequately (e.g. rural areas); CBP may also consider
providing positive incentives to strong commercial banks to open branches in
such areas by taking over the weak banks. According to the new policy, CBP no
longer questions the underlying business considerations behind a particular
bank's decision to open a new branch; its main concern is to verify the bank's
operational track record, good standing and sound financial condition, and any
market concentration problem which may arise. Another measure taken by CBP to
facilitate opening of bank branches is to eliminate the requirement for banks
to purchase special five-year securities to qualify for branch openings.
3.14     Taxation on Financial Intermediation.  Recognizing the impact of the
5Z GRT and the 20Z withholding tax on interbank deposits on intermediation
margins, the Government has agreed to eliminate them. However, recognizing
the government's difficult fiscal position, the Bank agrees that the
reductionielimination of taxes on financial intermediation should be
undertaken in a phased manner so that the budget deficit is not adversely
affected. It was originally thought that the enhanced revenues expected from
the value added tax (VAT) introduced on January 1, 1988 would enable the
Government to eliminate GRT at an early date. Unfortunately, total tax
revenues (including the yield from VAT) have been below expectations due to
tax collection and enforcement problems. It has now been agreed that both GRT
and the withholding tax on interbank deposits would be reduced and ultimately
eliminated in predetermined steps each year agreed tax to GNP ratio targets
are met.
3.15     During negotiations, the following tax revenue to GNP ratio targets
were agreed:
1989       1990       1991        1992
12.4       13.5       13.8        14.2
It was agreed that the 20X final withholding tax will be eliminated in the
year the agreed ratio is first reached or exceeded. In addition, GRT will be
reduced by 12 every time the agreed ratio is reached. The target ratios are
based on projections of tax revenue and GNP as agreed with the BanklDIF.
3.16     The present practice of paying 42 interest on high reserve require-
ments also results in increased intermediation costs. The issue Is complex
because the primary objective of reserve requirements is to conduct a given



- 26 -
monetary policy and any change in their level has direct and significant
implications for money and credit supply; any change in the compensation on
the required reserves will have fiscal implications in addition to having some
monetary policy implications. The present practice of paying a fixed rate on
reserves when the market interest rates are variable also results in wide
fluctuations in its impact on intermediation costs (para. 2.24). On the other
hand, since any change in the policy of compensation on reserves has
implications for the conduct of monetary policy, it was agreed during
negotiations that CBP will undertake a review of its present policy and
practices and furnish the report to the Bank before December 31, 1989.
3.17     Currently, deposits of more than two years have lower reserve
requirements. However, since these deposits are usually allowed to be with-
drawn before maturity without a penalty, the preferential lower reserve
requirement now represents an abuse and should consequently be eliminated.
The review to be undertaken by CBP as mentioned above will also cover this
practice of differentiated reserve requirements.
3.18     Legal Framework Governing Debt Recovery and Insolvencies.  To improve
the laws on foreclosure of real estate mortgages, the Government has agreed
that the following amendments to the law should be mades (a) the redemption
period should be reduced from twelve months to six months, to reduce the risk
of substantial deterioration in the value of the foreclosed assets; the law
should also authorize arbitration or a summary procedure to permit expeditious
determination of issues during negotiations for redemption; (b) the
differentiation between bank and nonbank mortgagees in the case of judicial
foreclosure should be eliminated, i.e., no redemption period should be allowed
after a judicial foreclosure even if the mortgagee is a bank (on the
assumption that the judicial process safeguards the rights and interest of a
mortgagor whether the mortgagee is a non-bank or a bank); and (c) access to
courts after an extrajudicial foreclosure, too easily available now, should be
tightened. The Government has constituted a committee to review the existing
law and draft amendments; its work has already started. The terms of
reference for the committee task were earlier agreed with the Bank.
3.19     Since reform of the insolvency and reorganization laws which have
become antiquated would require extensive amendments, the Government has
proposed to enact new legislation with the following objectives: (a) accord
the process of reorganization adequate protection from subversion arising from
seizure of assets by creditors; (b) give the courts explicit administrative
authority to enable the debtor enterprises to continue operations while the
reorganization proceeds; and (c) empower in an unambiguous fashion SEC or
another agency to appoint a trustee (SEC or the other agency should not itself
assume the trustee role, to avoid conflict of interest). The overriding
consideration would be to reduce substantially the total time involved, to
enable successful completion of the reorganization and restructuring of
enterprises. The same committee mentioned in the previous paragraph will also
draft the new insolvency law; the terms of reference for the committee's task
have already been agreed with the Bank.



- 27 -
Mobilization and Delivery of Term Funds
3.20     The objectives of reforms in the area of mobilization and delivery of
term funds are to (a) phase out the direct role CBP has played in the past in
credit allocation; (b) substantially reduce D8P's role in retail lending; and
(c) make DPB play a catalytic role in long-temn resource mobilization and
capital market development. This will be accomplished through (i) a clear
articulation of Government's role in the provision of credit, including
reduction of government-directed programs and the market orientation of terms
and conditions governing onlending of funds obtained by the government for use
by the private sector; and (ii) a restructuring of DBP so as to play a-a3jor
role in the wholesale mobilization and allocation of term funds.
3.21     Directed Credit Programs.  The CDP has agreed to continue to reduce
sharply, and ultimately eliminate completely, its direct involvement in the
management of government-sponsored credit allocation programs. Since mid-
1986, the responsibility for making policy decisions regarding a number of
agricultural programs has shifted to CALF. This reduction of CBP's role in
administering credit programs will be pursued further by transferring the
administr-'-ive responsit4lity for remaining agriculture sector credit programs
to CALF- ae sole exception is the Agricultural Loan Fund which will likely be
transfec:. f to the Land Bank of the Philippines. The administrative
responsibility for industrial sector programs will be assigned to a revamped
DBP (see paras. 3.23-3.26). When these measures have been completed according
to the schedule agreed with the Bank (see para. 4.4), CBP will have completely
withdrawn from the management of credit allocation programs, and its role
would be confined to liquidity management through discount window operations.
3.22     Onlending Terms.  The Government realizes the importance of lending
rates to be market oriented for all government-sponsored programs and for
those private sector credit programs for which funds are in the first instance
obtained by the government. It has reaffirmed that the lending rates to
participating financial institutions (PFIs) should approximate the cost of
similar funds in the market, and the rates to end users should be determined
by PPIle based solely on commercial considerations. This reaffirmation of
policy on interest rates is explicitly reflected in the Government's
Sstatement of Policy on Financial Sector Adjustment (see also para. 5.9).
3.23     Institutional Arrangement for Providing Long-Term Credit.  Given the
availability of domestic long-term funds through GSIS, SSS, pension funds and
insurance companies on the one hand, and the lack of long-term credit on the
other hand, there is need for a financial institution to assume the role of a
wholesaler by mobilizing long-term funds and channelling them to other finan-
cial institutions (retail) for onlending to individual enterprises. According
to agreed adjustment measures, a revamped DBP will fulfill this role. As a
wholesale institution, DBP will not assume the credit risk on the inoividual
subloans. It will also not assume the interest rate risk because rates would
be arranged between the retail banks and the end users.
3.24     Over time, DBP is expected to raise domestic funds by issuing bonds
which, if structured appropriately, could provide the foundation for the
development of a bond market in the Philippines. It could also issue large



- 28 -
denomination CDs, accept large term deposits or borrow otherwise on a medium
to long-term basis. In the long run, DBP as a wholesale bank could also
develop a market in long-term paper and envisage a role in standardizing and
securitizing industrial loans made by the retail financial institutions.
3.25      The transformation of DBP into a primarily wholesale institution
will involve a reorientation of its strategic focus and operational activi-
ties. It is envisaged that while it would engage in some retail lending when
the amounts involved are such as to make its participation in a syndication
necessary, or in specific subsectors not served by other lending conduits, it
would substantially reduce its retail lending operations to carry out whole-
sale banking functions effectively. It is expected that by the end of 1994,
DBP's outstanding portfolio will already be 69S on account of wholesaling
operations; on the basis of annual commitments, wholesale operations are
expected to account for more than 80? of total commitments.
3.26     In addition to developing a market in long-term paper, DBP will have
two additional functions. First, it has been designated as the main conduit
for official foreign borrowings, the proceeds of which are used by the private
sector. Second, the Government/CBP has agreed to transfer to it
responsibility for the management and administration of the industrial sector
credit programs (Apex and IGLF) which were sponsored by the Government but
which are envisaged to be run on market terms, with the participating
financial institutions assuming the credit risk. By carrying out these
functions, DBP will help ensure that the lending terms and conditions,
including interest rates, are unifornily applied (except to account for the
degree of risk) irrespective of source of financing. The arrangement is also
expected to result in better coordination and more effective monitoring of
different credit programs.
3.27     The progress made in the transformation of DBP will be assessed
against performance criteria discussed and agreed during negotiations. Before
the release of the second tranche of the proposed loan, DBP will have (i)
privatized 252 of the total voting stock of the five regional development
banks which will have been created earlier by consolidation of its branches,
(il) created two new departments (Capital Markets Department and Financial
Institutions Department) and appointed their heads, (iii) increased the
proportion of wholesale lending in its total outstanding portfolio from 0 now
to at least 34?, and (iv) reduced its staff by about 250 persons.
IV. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
4.1      The degree of commitment by the Government to implenent the reform
program is very high. This was clear during the conduct of FSS by its active
help and participation and by its initiatives in developing the adjustment
measures. It is evidenced further in the Government's keenness to start
implementation of the program. In fact, the agencies concerned, and CBP in
particular, have not only started actions on many fronts but already made
substantial progress in implementing the agreed reform program.

Actions Completed or in Progress
4.Z      In the area of supervision and regulation, the following actions have
been completed or are in progress:
(a) Amendments to banking statutes agreed with the Bank have been
presented to the Congress for legislative approval. These amendments
relate to (i) guidelines governing emergency loans; (ii) cease and
desist orders; (iii) criteria for appointment of receivers,
(iv) insider abuse (or DOSRI loans), and (v) protection of CBP staff
against suits for actions taken in the performance of their duties.
(b)  Policy statements in respect of (i) granting new bank licenses;
(ii) relaxing restrictions on branch openings, and (iii) weak bank.
failures and closings have been adopted by MB.
(c) Draft terms of reference (TORs) have already been prepared by CBP,
and agreed with the Bank, to undertake the review and revision of
(i) commercial banks' reporting requirements, (ii)'-guidelines for
asset valuation and loan loss provision, (iii) guidelines for
treatment of trust accounts, (iv) generally accepted accounting
principles governing the preparation of the banks' annual accounts,
and (v) debt collection and insolvency laws. Study teams with
representation from relevant professional agencies (e.g.BAP and ASC)
have already been constituted and work begun.
4.3      In the area of institutional arrangements for depositor protection,
the following actions have been completedlin progress:
(a) A new President of PDIC has been appointed (the former President was
one of CBP Deputy Governors); he is from the private banking sector.
(b) The'draft PDIC Act, agreed with the Bank, has been submitted to the
Congress for legislative approval.
(c) PDIC's institutional strengthening plan satisfactory to the Bank has
been formally approved by its Board.
4.4      In the area of fund mobilization, delivery of term funds, and phasing
out of CBP's role in credit allocation, the following actions have been taken
or are in progress:
(a) A bill to eliminate Agri/Agra lending requirement has been introduced
in Congress and has CBP support.
(b) The Governor of CBP has signed an executive order to transfer all
agricultural credit programs (except ALF) currently managed by CBP to
CALF; the transfer is expected to be completed expeditiously. For
the transfer of ALF, negotiations between CBP and DOA are in
progress. The Land Bank of the Philippines is likely to be chosen.



- 30 ,
(c) A committee formed to draw up a detailed plan to transfer IGLF and
Apex programs to DBP has completed its report on Apex and its
transfer is expected soon. A schedule for the transfer of IGLF was
agreed during negotiations; it is expected to be completed by June
1990.
(4) DBP has revised its Policy Statement to reflect the change in the
orientation of its operations; the revised Policy Statement has been
reviewed by DOF and CBP, and is acceptable to the Bank. It has been
formally approved by DBP's Board.
Future Actions
4.5      To complete the proposed reform program, the following actions will
need to be completeds
(a) Lesislative Action. The draft amendments to the Central Bank Act and
the new draft PDIC Act already before it, will need to be approved by
the Congress. The timing of actual enactment into law of the
amendments depends on the legislative process and is, therefore,
uncertain. Given the Government's commitment to the reform program,
it will push for early enactment. Since the proposed amendments are
among the key adjustment measures, the second tranche of the proposed -
loan will not be released until the draft amendments become the law
substantially as agreed with the Bank.
(b) Completion of Studies and Actions Based Thereon. Several study teams
have been constituted and begun their work. They have to complete
their respective tasks and their recommendations have to be acted
upon. The Bank will closely follow up the work as it progresses.
The second tranche release will be contingent upon satisfactory
completion of all studies and upon the recommendations being acted
upon.
(c)  Institutional Strengthening of PDIC.  PDIC's institutional
strengthening plan was reviewed and agreed at negotiations. Before
the second tranche is released, it will have a new Act to provide a
satisfactory legal framework, and its financial resources will have
been augmented by an increase in its paid in capital to P 3 billion
(with further increases in 1991 and 1992 amounting to P 1.5 billion
and P 0.5 billion respectively). In addition, its fee income will
have also been increased.  PDIC's institutional rebuilding will
probably take several years to be complete in all respects but the
key steps will have been taken and necessary resources (both
financial as well as managerial) put in place before the second
tranche of the proposed loan is released.
(d) Transformation of DBP into a Wholesale Institution. The process has
started but full transformation will take about four years.  Transfer
of Apex program is expected to be completed by June 1989 and IGLF by
June 1990. To ensure satisfactory progress, DBP will need to achieve
agreed interim performance targets (para. 3.27) before the second
tranche of the proposed loan is released.



- 31 -
(e)  Termination of CBP's Role in Management of Government Sponsored
Credit Programs. As stated earlier, basic decisions have already
been taken. Smaller programs are expected to be transferred out of
CBP relatively soon. But major program (e.g. IGLF) transfers need
detailed preparation and planning which have started. The actual
transfer of all programs (condition of second tranche release) is
expected to be completed before June 1990.
V. THE PROPOSED LOAN
Description of the Loan
5.1      Country Strategy.  The Bank's overall lending strategy in the
Philippines is to provide resources necessary to support development in a
highly indebted country. These resources are aimed at either directly
financing the 1oreign exchange costs of discrete investment projects needed to
sustain growth, or to support policy-based operations designed to bring about
necessary economic reforms. Since 1983, the Bank has undertaken
infrastructure investment projects in ports, irrigation, and power, and also
provided financing for discrete projects in education, health, transport,
industry, and agriculture sectors. In the second category i.e. policy based
lending, the Bank has financed operations which dealt with issues in the
government financial sector, government corporations, housing, trade
liberalization and public investment. In addition, future policy based
operations are envisaged that will focus on reforms in power, education, and
the environment. The present operation is within the second category of
lending for a critical area of reform required in support of the growth
process. In addition, it will help close the emerging balance of payments gap
by providing quick-disbursing foreign exchange resources.  In the past, these
operations have also served as vehicles which have attracted substantial
amounts of co-financing from other donors as well, further enhancing their
overall balance of payments impact. This is also expected to be the case with
the proposed operation (see para. 5.12).
5.2      Objectives.  The proposed loan would support far-reaching policy and
institutional changes; the Government is undertaking serious sustained
adjustment in the financial sector as well as on the broader economic front.
As pointed out in para. 1.8, there is a gap in meeting the estimated foreign
resource requirements, and the loan would provide the country with much needed'
foreign exchange.
5.3      Although the proposed loan is fully justified by balance of payments
and resource gap considerations, it should be noted that the program
implementation will have substantial budgetary consequences in 1990-91 period.
These arise because of the increase in PDIC's capital by P 3 billion ($150
million approximately) during these two years that has been agreed as part of
PDIC's strengthening. The proposed loan will, therefore, also help support
the budget during the period when it would be under pressure as a result of
the Government implementing the agreed adjustment measures.



- 32 -
5.4      Amount, Borrower and Executing Agency.  The adjustment measures will
be supported by the proposed Bank loan of US$300 million equivalent. The
proposed loan will be made to the Republic of the Philippines. Given the
nature of most of the agreed reforms, it is proposed to designate CBP as the
executing agency. The loan will be for a term of 20 years i&-luding five
years of grace, and will carry interest at the Bank's standari. variable rate.
5.5      Tranching of the Proposed Loan.  It is proposed to disburse the loan
in two tranches. Tranching has been determined in relation to thv Adjustment
Program which has been designed so that the Program becomes irreversible by
the time the proposed loan is considered by the Executive Directors. All
required amendments to existing Acts to carry out the Adjustment Program
(except one) have not only been drafted and agreed with the Bank, but have
already been actually introduced in Congress; the sole exception is the low
relating to bankruptcies and insolvencies which will require more time to be
studied and drafted. Where no legislative action is required, and specific
elements of the Adjustment Program can be implemented by administrative action
without any study as such, it will have been completed before presentation of
the proposed loan to the Executive Directors (e.g., revision of guidelines
governing emergency loans to banks in difficulty; adoption of the policy
resolution by MB on granting new bank licenses, opening of new bank branches
and consolidation in the banking industry; adoption of an institutional
development plan by PDIC Board; adoption of DBP policy statement by DBP Board,
MB and DOP). Where actions have to await results of further studies, the
terms of reference have been finalized and approved by the Bank, study teams
constituted and work already started. The first tranche will, therefore, be
disbursed as soon as the loan becomes effective, with no particular conditions
set for the effectiveness of the loan.
5.6      The second tranche would be released when the actions specified in
the attached matrix (Annex 3) have been completed. The key actions will be
the followings
(a)  the draft amendments to the Central Bank Act have become the law
substantially as agreed with the Bank;
(b)  the draft new PDIC Act has become the law substantially as agreed
with the Bank;
(c)  PDIC's capital has been increased as agreed with the Bank; and
(d)  The management of all government sponsored credit programs has been
transferred out of CBP.
5.7      Although the Adjustment Program is front loaded and the entire
Program would be well entrenched by the time the proposed loan is presented to
the Executive Directors, it is proposed to make the amounts of the two
tranches equal, to retain sufficient leverage to complete the reforms in an
expeditious manner. The amounts of the tranches will, therefore, be $150
million each.



- 33 -
Procurement -ud Disbursement
5.8      Procurement.  The overall responsibility for project administration
will rest with CBT which will be the implementing agency. Both prlvate *nd
public sector imports vill be eligible for financing under the proposed loan.
All Import contracts costing US$3.0 million or more will be subject to
simplified international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Contracts for lesser value, if originating
in public sector, will be awarded through normal trade channels on the basis
of Governsent's standard procurement procedures which are acceptable to the
Bank. Contracts of le8s than US$5.0 million originating In the private sector
will be subject to compliance with normal commercial practices of the
importers which ensure reasonable prices and are satisfactory to the Bank.
Subject to the Bank's prior approval, contracts for common internationally
traded commodities may be procured through the organised International
coamodities markets.
5.9      Disbursements.  The proceeds of the proposed Loan for rinancial
Sector Adjustment would be disbursed against general Imports not contained in
a negative list. The negative list includes, inter alia, goods and services
for military and para-military purposes and for luxury consumption. It is
expected that the entire loan amount would be disbursed before December 1990.
The .local currency counterpart funds would be used for general budgetary
expenditures.
Audit
5.10     The accounts of the expenditure to be incurred under the loan will be
audited by the Commission on Audit.  The first audit report will cover the
period ended December 31, 1989; it will be submitted annually thereafter
within sixty days of the end of the period.
Statement of Policy on Financial Sector Adiustment
5.11     The proposea loan is based on a Government Statement of Policy on
Financial Sector Adjustment (Annex 2). It is in the fotm of a letter to the
Bank, signed jointly by the Secretary, Department of Finance, and the
Governor, CBP.  It commlts the Government to continue to follow sound
macroeconomic policies, and to undertake and implement the adjustment measures
discussed in Section III. More specifically, the Statement of PQlicy on
Financial Sector Reforms spells out the measures to be taken concerning
(a) bank supervision and regulation; (b) PDIC, including an increase in its
capital resources; (c) revision of laws and regulations governing real estate
mortgage and insolvencies; (d) transfer of all industrial credit allocation
programs to DBP and agricultural programs to other appropriate financial
institutions, so that in the long run, CBP will terminate its involvement in
credit allocation programs (except for the management of the discount window
to control liquidity in the system); (e) measures relating to GRT and the
Final Withholding Tax on inter-bank deposits; (f) interest rate policy
relating to government sponesored programs and for those private sector credit
programs for which funds are, in the first instance, obtained by the
Government; and (g) measures relating to DBP. In addition to the Statement of
Policy on Financial Sector Adjustment, DBP is also adopting a new policy
statement setting out in detail its future plans and direction. This deals
specifically with the nature of its operations, i.e., wholesale instead of
retail banking.
t



- 34 -
5.12     The Statement of Policy on Financial Sector Adjustment is reflected
in the matrix of Actions to Support Financial Sector Adjustment -
Implementation Schedule (Annex 3).  Together these two instruments include
appropriate targets and the timing of various actions. They will provide a
framework for subsequent loan supervision and become the basis for monitoring
actual -performance.
Cofinancing
5.13     The idea of cofinancing the proposed loan with other donors/lenders
has already been raised. The Export-Import Bank of-Japan(Eximbank) is likely
to cofinance the proposed loan; its staff participated in the appraisal in
December 1988, and in the negotiations in March 1989, as an observer.
Although no formal decision has been made, it is expected that the Eximbank
will participate with an amount equivalent or close to the Bank loan.
Technical Assistance
5.14     To assist the government in implementing the adjustment program, the
Government of Japan has agreed to make available grant funds amounting to
Y 607.5 million (approximately US$5 million equivalent) from its cofinancing
facility with the Bank. The funds provided would be used to finance
(a) development of systems and computer equipment for CBP, DBP and PDIC to
improve their ability to process and analyse data in a timely fashion,
(b) training of CBP, PDIC and DBP staff to fulfill their functions more
effectively, and (c) financing of the cost of consultants to help in
undertaking the various studies envisaged under the adjustment program and in
implementing the institutional strengthening plans of DBP and PDIC.
Benefits and Risks
5.15     The main benefits from the loan will derive from the support it will
give to the development efforts of the Government. This support will come in
the form of (i) encouraging policy and institutional reforms; (ii) providing
direct balance of payment and budgetary support; and (iii) improving the
banking environment which should lead to better savings performance in the
future. It is expected that bank supervision and regulation functions would
improve in effectiveness and less time would be wasted in unnecessary
litigation which has been a problem in the past. These reforms and the
measures to improve the institutional arrangements for depositor protection
are expected to enhance confidence in the banking system, improve efficiency
and lower the cost of services provided to real sectors. These factors
combined with the establishment of a mechanism to mobilize and channel long-
term funds for investment, will not only sustain but give an impetus to
overall economic development and growth. In short, the reform program is
expected to result in a healthier, more competitive and efficient banking
system, and consequent benefits to the investors and savers alike.
5.16     The risks associated with this type of program are mainly those
related to possible delays and/or inadequate implementation. The principal
concern in this regard is that the legislative action could either be unduly
delayed or prove to be deficient when completed. The risk is mitigated by the
fact that all amendments (except revision of the bankruptcylinsolvency Act,



_ 35 -
which is expected to take considerable time) have already been drafted and
agreed with the Bank. Further, these agreed amendments have also been
presented to the Congress for approval. Satisfactory progress thereafter,
including actual passage of key legislation, will be a condition for the
release of the second tranche. It should also be noted that the Government's
comitment to carry out the needed reforms is very high, and a significant
number of prior actions have already been taken.
VI.  BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES
6.1      As of September 30, 1988, the Philippines had received 107 Bank loans
(of which two were on Third Window terms) amounting to $4,623.75 million and
six IDA credits amounting to $107.36 million. IFC total gross investments as
of September 30, 1988 totalled $222.5 million and investments held by IFC
(outstanding) totaled $92.8 million. The status of Bank Group operations in
the Philippines is shown in Annex 5. The share of the Bank Group in total MLT
debt disbursed and outstanding is currently about 152 and its share in total
debt service is about 20X. These ratios are expected to be about 13X and 152,
respectively, by 1995.
6 .2     Bank Group lending to the Philippines expanded from an average of
about $90 million and four loans per year in FY71-75 to an annual average of
about $420 million and seven loans in FY8O-84. However, the lending program
decreased dramatically in FY85 and FY86 because of the limited scope for
traditional project lending under economic circumstances then prevailing.
Only two loans were made in FY86 for a total of $151 million. Although the
lending program was reduced in size during the stabilization period, the
emphasis of the program ensured that greater weight was assigned to allevia-
tion of the adverse socioeconomic impact of the economic stabilization pro-
gram. The Bank has financed projects in virtually all sectors of the economy,
with particular emphasis on agriculture which has accounted for almost one
third of total Bank/IDA lending. Lending for industry, transportation,
energy, and social sectors followed in declining order of magnitude.
6.3      The recovery of the economy, and the reorientation of Government
policies after February, 1986, has facilitated an expansion in Bank lending.
In FY87, lending totalled $342 million, led chiefly by the Economic Recovery
Loan. This loan supported reforms of the public investment program, the
government financial institutions, the trade regime, and the tax system. Two
tranches of $100 million each have been released; it is anticipated that the
third and last tranche will be released in 1989. In FY88, total lending
expanded to $505 million, for four operations. These included the Government
Corporate Reform Program loan, which supports reforms in the management of the
government corporate sector, including the privatization, closure or merger of
the majority of government corporations. A Housing Sector Loan is providing
mortgage finance for the housing industry, and supports a reform program
designed to strengthen public sector housing finance institutions, including a
move toward more market-oriented interest rates.
6.4      In agriculture, lending focused initially on expanding the irrigation
system, credit programs, and other services to support rice production. The
experience with irrigation has been positive with the establishment of a



- 36 _
strong institution and expansion in irrigated areas, although cost recovery is
still a problem. Efforts have also been made to diversify agricultural
,production through loans for tree crops, livestock, fisheries, and integrated
rural development projects. The Bank has also provi4ed assistance under the
Agricultural SectorlInputs project to support programs of policy and institu-
tional reforms, and under the Agricultural Credit project to provide credit to
agricultural producers and to help establish a framework for a financially
sound rural credit system.
6.5      In the industrial and financial sectors, lending has supported policy
reforms under the Government's structural adjustment program. Structural
adjustment lending in 1980 and 1983 ($502.3 million, total) supported a series
of reforms of the tariff structure, the system of industrial incentives,
energy pricing and export promotion. An Industrial Finance Loan approved in
PY81 supported improvements in financial sector policies, including
liberalizing interest rates, reducing bank specialization, and increasing the
availability of longer-term funds. It also introduced the *apexu concept, to
broaden the reach of Bank lending by channelling lons through a number of
financial intermediaries, In addition, the Bank has supported a textile
sector restructuring project and has continued to provide financial support
and technical assistance to small and medium industries.
6.6      In infrastructure, the Bank has supported a number of transportation
projects (five highway projects, two rural roads projects, three ports
projects and one shipping project). The Bank's role has been to assist the
Government in the implementation of its program in the sector, with special
emphasis on institutional issues and strengthening maintenance capabilities,
and rural development. The Second Rural Roads Improvement Project (FY86), for
example, was designed to alleviate poverty in rural areas by providing farmers
easy access to markets and social infrastructure. To mitigate the social
consequences of the stabilization program, Bank-supported projects in water,
urban and regional development emphasized improvement of basic social
services. Future objectives would be to continue to provide assistance to the
sector institutions with which the Bank deals, assist them to formulate sector
priorities and investment programs, and implement appropriate sector policies.
6.7      The Bank strategy in the near future is one of continued support for
the Government's program, to assist in sustaining the recovery through financ-
ing critical investments, and to encourage the deepening of the reform process
within key institutions. At the same time the Philippines needs to start
addressing in an effective way the longer term structural issues underlying
the economyt poverty, population growth, and environmental management. Given
an adequate policy response on the part of the Government, the Bank could
support it with economic and sector analyses and a lending program of $400-600
million annually. The Bank has a crucial role to play through our continued
dialog with Government on these issues, our program of sector work and related
policy lending, as well as through providing coordination of donor support
through the mechanism of the Consultative Group.
6.8      In the ongoing two-year period we envisage further loans in support
of structural reforms. The proposed loan to support financial sector reforms
is the major operation during the current fiscal year. Another operation this
year will support small and medium scale industry; other operations currently
being processed relate to industrial restructuring, health development and
power distribution.



- 37 -
6.9      The Bank is engaged in a number of economic and sector studies which
will help define development issues and future lending strategies in key
sectors. Reports on poverty, natural resource management, and the energy,
financial and education sectors were completed in-1988. Their findings have
been discussed with the Government and will form the basis of future lending
operations. A new Country Economic Memorandum, based on a mission which
visited the Philippines in June, 1988 has been completed and circulated as
Report No. 7438-PH dated January, 1989. This report will serve as the
documentation for a forthcoming Consultative Group meeting, tentatively
scheduled for June, 1989. Other sector and economic work scheduled for the
coming year includes studies of regionalization/decentralization and rural
electrification.
VII. BANK-FUND COOPERATION
7.1      Bank-Fund collaboration in dealing with general economic matters in
the Philippines has been close and satisfactory. As stated earlier in paras.
1.12 - 1.13 the overall policy stance taken by the two institutions has been
consistent; the objectives of IMF's Standby Arrangements and the Bank's
Policy7based loans are complementary and mutually reinforcing. The IMP
attaches high importance to the reform of the financial sector and strongly
supports the proposed operation. Satisfactory implementation of financial
sector reforms will be an important part of IMF's medium-term macro reform
program to support its proposed EFF. In turn, the IMF program will ensure the
macro stability which will be necessary for the successful implementation of
the Adjustment Program to be supported by the proposed loan.
7.2      Two IMP staff members (IMF's Assistant General Counsel (Legislation)
and a staff member from the Central Banking Department) participated in the
November 1987 financial sector mission, whose report has formed the basis for
the proposed operation. The IMF staff Darticipated actively in the review of
the draft sector report. The IMP's Assistant General Counsel (Legislation)
participated again in the mission of June 1988 to discuss the financial sector
study report and to start preparation of the proposed loan. He also
participated in the appraisal mission.
VIII. RECOMMENDATION
8.1      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreements of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed loan.

PHILIPPINES
FINANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
MINISTRY OF FINANCE
MANILA
April 3, 1989
Mr. Barber Conable
President
World Bank
Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Conable:
Ret Statement of Policy on Financial Sector Ad3ustment
As indicated !n our letter of January 2, 1987, the Government of the
Republic of the Philippines has since carried out a number of reforms in the
areas of trade policy, public investment, taxation and restructuring of
government financial institutions. The Government has also followed, in the
context of standby arrangements with the International Monetary Fund ( Wi),
appropriate policies regarding monetary base growth, public sector credit
expansion and short term external debt. As a result of following these and
other appropriate macro economic policies more generally, the Philippine
economy was able to achieve a GNP growth rate of 5.9 per cent in 1987 and 6.7
per cent in 1988, without producing inordinate inflationary pressures and
exchange rate instability.
It is the intention of the Government to further strengthen the macro
economic framework by reducing the public sector deficit, containing
inflation, maintaining a competitive exchange rate, and raising savings and
investment levels so that an overall GNP growth of 6.5 per cent is achieved in
the medium term.
The Government recognizes that the financial sector, particularly the
commercial banking segment which is the largest component of the sector, must
play a major role in efficient resource mobilization and allocation to help
the economy achieve overall growth objectives. The Government also recognizes
that reforms are needed in the financial system to enable it to play its due
role.
The Government is, therefore, undertaking a financial sector
adjustment program, and is requesting the World Bank to make available to the
Philippines a quick disbursing policy based loan in the amount of $300 million
equivalent in support of the adjustment program. The broad objective is to
strengthen and improve the financial system, particularly the commercial
banking segment. More specifically, the adjustment program is intended tot
(i) strengthen the supervisory and regulatory framework for commercial banks,



-41-                       ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 9
(ii) improve the institutional arrangements for depositor protection, (iii)
reduce intermediation costs in the banking system by improving competitive
conditions and efficiency, and (iv) improve the institutional framework for
the mobilization and delivery of long-term credit.
1.       Bank Supervision and Regulation
a. Commercial Bank Reporting Requirements. Although the system of
reports that commercial banks are required to submit to the Central Bank of
the Philippines is adequate for supervisory needs, it is recognized that all
of the data and information thus received may not be fully and effectively
utilized. Accordingly, the Central Bank has initiated, in cooperation with
the Bankers Association of the Philippines (BAP), a comprehensive review of
commercial banks' reporting to the Central Bank with a view to standardizing
reports and enhancing electronic evaluation of data. Revised reporting
requirements will be prescribed when the review, now in progress, has been
completed. It is our intention to streamline and place greater reliance for
supervision and regulation on continuous offsite monitoring through analysis
of these reports.
b. Guidelines for Asset Valuation and Loan Loss Provisions. Although
the Central Bank has formulated guidelines on loan loss and other risk
classification, the rules for banks to make loan loss provisions have not
been uniform in their application. The Central Bank is, therefore, developing
underlying standardized principles for asset valuation and loan provisioning
and intends to require that these be applied uniformly by all banks.
c. Guidelines for Treatment of Trust Accounts.  Trust accounts have
increased substantially in recent years. 'hile part of this increase
represents a genuine growth of trust business, we believe that in some cases
trust accounts are being used to undertake normal banking activities on an off
balance sheet basis, with serious tax and reserve requirement implications.
We believe that the practices involved in trust account management need to be
investigated in order to devise a set of measures to prevent abuse.
Accordingly, a joint Central Bank/Bureau of Internal Revenue team has been set
up to review guidelines for the treatment of trust accounts by commercial
banks. Revised guidelines wi1l be issued after completion of the review
currently in progress.
d. Guidelines for Financial Reporting. The Central Bank dialogues
with the Accounting Standards Council (ASC) on the Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP) for banks and the Regulatory Accounting
Principles (RAP) for the purpose of reconciling them among other things.
Recently the Central Bank, ASC and BAP concluded the GAAP for the banking
industry. In order to improve consistency and transparency in financial
reporting, it is intended that RAP and GAAP for banks be reviewed further and
revised if there is need, concentrating on the definition of .'-_ceriality; the
definition, classification and reporting of renegotiated and past due loans;
the treatment of trust accounts; and the definition, treatment and reporting
of specific as well as general provisions for loan losses. The review
exercise in consultation with ASC and BAP has already started.
e. Guidelines Governing Emergency Loans to Banks in Distress. The
guidelines to cover emergency loans by the Central Bank to commercial banks in



-42-                      ANNEX 2
Page 3 of 9
distress will be revised in order to ensure consistency in their application.
The revised guidelines will provide that the maximum amount that the Central
Bank can advance to a bank in distress will not exceed 50 percent of the
amount of a bank's total deposits and deposit substitutes. The revised
guideline2 will also provide that the emergency advance be disbursed in two
tranches.
The Monetary Board has the authority substantially to implement the
measures indicated in (a) to (e) above. The measures indicated under items
(a) to (d) will be implemented when the reviews now underway have been
completed.  We expect that new regulations to give effect to these measures
will be issued in due course. Measures (f) to (j) discussed below, require
amendments to the Central Bank Act and the PDIC Act. These amendments have
been incorporated in bills which have already been introduced into the
Legislature, and the Government intends to pursue vigorously for the passage
of these bills.
f. Cease and Desist Orders. A new instrument of bank regulation is
being developed for use in a process of graduated response before it bs$omes
necessary to invoke maximal means such as commercial liquidation proceedings
against a bank. It is believed that the instrument may be particularly useful
in efforts to counter insider abuse before the latter causes irreversible
damage to a bank that may lead to its failure.
g.8New Criteria for Appointment of Receivers for Distressed Banks.
The criteria currently used by the Monetary Board in deciding whether or not
to a-,point a receiver for a distressed bank include its determination (i) that
the iiabilities of the bank exceed the realizable value of its assets, or
(i , that the bank's continuance in business would involve probable loss to
the depositors. Since these criteria may not be flexible enough to permit
timely action by the Monetary Board under all circumstances, it is proposed
therefore to add two additional criteria for appointing a receiver: (iii) that
the bank is unable to meet its obligations as they mature or (iv) that there
is a willful violation of a cease and desist order that has become final.
h. Curbing Insider Abuse (DOSRI Loans).  It has been determined that,
as a consequence of the current law on depositor secrecy, bank supervisors
have been handicapped in their efforts to detect insider loan abuses in a
timely fashion.  Such loans have frequently been associated with bank
failures. In order to curb abuses stemming from these loans, the Government
intends to seek an amendment to the current banking law so that all bank
directors, officers, or stockholders, together with their related interests as
defined in the law, will be deemed to have waived the secrecy accorded to
their bank deposits wherever held in the Philippines when their borrowings
from any of their banks exceed P5 million or 52 of the bank's net worth or the
maximum amount permitted by law, whichever is lower.
i. Empowering Banking Supervising Authorities to Institute Civil
Suits against Bank Directors and Officials Accused of Wrongdoing. Bank
directors, bank officials and others accused of wrongdoing are currently
subject to criminal suits which are protracted and difficult to prosecute.
The revised PDIC Act seeks that both the law and the practice in this regard
will be changed to authorize PDIC to institute civil suits. Civil suits will
serve as an additional disincentive against wrongdoing. Since the standard of
proof required in civil suits is less stringent than for criminal suits, the
chance of a successful outcome will also be enhanced.

J. Protection of the Staff of the Banking Supervisory Authorities
from personal losses resulting from suits brought against them for action
taken in performance of their duty. Civil suits have been brought against
members of the staff of the Central Bank for actions taken by them in the
performance of their duties. In order to protect the staff of the Central
Bank from such suits, the government is seeking to amend the Central Bank Act
so that the Central Bank is authorized to estallish reserves and make
expenditures fort (a) the provision of legal services; and (b) the purchase of
liability insurance or the provision of self insurance or coinsurance for its
personnel in connection with legal case arising from the performance of their
duties and functions. A protection against suit is also being proposed for
the staff of PDIC on actions done by them in good faith in the exercise of
their functions, through an amendment to the PDIC Act.
2.       Arrangements for Depositor Protection
Currently, the Central Bank staff acts as the conservators, receivers
and liquidators of failing banks. This practice gives rise to questions of
conflict of interest and also places a heavy burden on the Central Bank that
adversely affects its normal supervisory and regulatory role. On the other
hand, it deprives PDIC of any say in the affairs of a failing bank even though
PDIC is responsible to pay depositors after a bank has been closed. We
believe that the solution to its problem lies in a substantially enlarged role
for PDIC. Accordingly, the Government is seeking amendments to the PDIC Act
and the Central Bank Act so that PDIC will not only be authorized to serve,
but will be required to be appointed, as the receiver in all cases. This
means that the Central Bank's role would cease as soon as a determination has
been made by the Monetary Board that the condition of a bank has deteriorated
to an extent that the bank has to be closed and a receiver should be
appointed. All subsequent decisions would, in accordance with the revised
PDIC Act, be made by PDIC.
The measure discussed in the prior paragraph would result in a
greatly expanded role for PDIC. In addition, the role may be expected to
expand further in the future since the financial responsibility of PDIC is
also being increased inasmuch as the maximum amount of deposits insured is
proposed to be raised from P 40,000 to possibly P 60,000. Accordingly, it is
recognized that the PDIC must be substantially strengthened financially as
well as in terms of management and staff. The PDIC has prepared and adopted
an Institutional Strengthening Plan. It is the intention of the Government to
fully support PDIC in implementing the Plan.
In order to increase the role of PDIC in dealing with failed banks
and to enable it to implement the Plan, amendments to the PDIC Act and the
Central Bank Act have been incorporated into draft legislation. The bills
have already been introduced in the legislature, and the government shall
pursue vigorously the passage of these bills so that on or before the release
of the second tranche of the proposed loan, these bills would have been
enacted into laws substantially as already agreed with the World Bank.
To further strengthen PDIC, its paid-in capital needs to be
increased. The Government has assessed the resource requirements of PDIC to
perform its role effectively, taking into account the current obligations and



-44 -                       ANX 2
Page 5 of 9
resources of PDIC. The Government is seeking from Congress an increase in the
authorized capital of PDIC from its present P 2.0 billion to P 5.0 billion.
To effect this increase, the Government will request Congress to approve
budgetary allocations increasing the capital of PDIC by P 1.5 billion in 1990,
P 1.5 billion in 1991, and P 0.5 billion in 1992, in addition to the present
paid-in capital of P 1.0 billion and the P 0.5 billion already programmed for
1989.
3.       Intermediation Costs
The Government realizes that the financial intermediation costs i1.
the country are high and need to be reduced. The intermediation costs are
high because (a) there is lack of effective competition resulting in high
profit margins; (b) there are taxes on financial intermediation; (c) the debt
collection and insolvency laws and procedures entail inordinate delays and
therefore add to costs. In addition, the Central Bank's policy governing
compensation on reserves has also been revised. Steps have been taken in each
of these areas, as discussed below.
a. Increasing Effective Competition. As provided in its Charter, it
is the responsibility of the Central Bank to administer the monetary, banking
and credit system of the country. Accordingly, the health and performance of
the commercial banking sector, among other financial sectors, is one of the
Central Bank's major concerns knowing that the efficiency of financial
intermediation will help ensure the attainment of the country's overall
economic development program. Towards this end, it is the policy of the
Government to enhance and maintain conditions    conducive to effective
competition in the banking industry. The Monetary Board has accordingly
adopted the following policies for the purpose and will be disseminated in the
form of a circular.
(i)   Consolidation of the Banking Industry.  The elimination of weak
banks with high operating costs and the development of larger
and stronger commercial banks is expected to create healthy
competition and to bring about better services at lower costs
and a stronger financial system. The Central Bank shall
therefore refrain from sustaining weak banks except in times of
general financial emergency or when specific banks face problems
of liquidity rather than of solvency. The Central Bank shall
continue to encourage weak banks to merge with, or consolidate
into, stronger institutions as an option to strengthen the
weaker units as well as consider closing them in accordance with
the law. In the consolidation process, the Central Bank shall
continue to observe the principle of diffusion of equity in
commercial banks to prevent the concentration of ownership in
the financial systemi among a few.
(ii) Licensing of New Banks and Branches. The Central Bank shall
continue to review its policies on the licensing of new banks
and the opening of new branches to make them responsive to a
growing economy and to enhance and maintain effective
competition in the industry. There is no bar to granting new
bank licenses and, accordingly, the establishment of new banks
in the future shall be allowed, with the Central Bank



-45-
ANNEX 2
Page 6 of 9
determining the qualifications, both qualitative and
quantitative which shall be made public, such as but not limited
to compliance with all requirements of existing laws,
capitalization, direction and administration as well as the
integrity and the responsibility of the organizers and
administrators to reasonably assure the safety of the interest
which the public may entrust them. A new bank may also be
allowed to be established as a result of merger or consolidation
of weak and marginal banks.
On the opening of new branches, the Central Bank's objectives
are to increase availability of branches in the rural areas and
to increase competition in the banking industry generally.
Toward that end, the Central Bank has lifted the requirement to
purchase special five-year government securities as a condition
to open new branches. In rural areas, all restrictions on
opening new branches have been removed. The Central Bank may
also consider providing positive incentives to strong commercial
banks to open new branches by taking over weak banks. In urban
and particularly metropolitan areas, the Central Bank shall
retain its discretionary policy on branching, but allow a bank
to open a new branch so long as the bank's market share in that
area would not create any market concentration problems.   While
the Central Bank would not concern itself with the bank's
underlying business considerations, it will take into account
both in the case of rural and urban areas the bank's track
record of viability and prudential operations and take into
consideration the adverse effects of the-costs that the new
braneh could have on the bank's financial condition in the short
run.
(iii) Uni-'ormity of treatment. The Central Bank shall continue to
apply its rules and regulations uniformly and without
discrimination upon all commercial banks and other financial
institutions, whether government or private.
(iv) Maintenance of Conditions of Competition. The Central Bank
shall continue to maintain condition of competition among the
commercial banks and the whole financial system, encouraging
price competition and market-determined interest rates and
intermediation costs.
At the end of the year and annually thereafter, the Monetary Board will
review the impact of the above-mentioned measures, and will consider such
additional measures as may be necessary to achieve the stated objectives on
increasing effective competition.
b. Reducing Taxes on Financial Intermediation.
While it is the government's intention to phase out in due time
the 5 per cent gross receipts tax and the 20 per cent withholding tax on
inter-bank deposits, this is not possible at this time because of adverse
budget implications. The phase out would therefore be determined by the
progress made towards attaining the tax revenue objectives and improvement



-46 -                       ANNEX 2
Page 7 of 9
in tax administration.  The following tax revenue targets will be used as a
measure for these purposes#
1989    1990    1991    1992
Tax revenue to GN? ratio             12.4    13.5    13.8    14.2
Should the target be met for any given year, the Government will seek the
elimination of the withholding tax o1- interbank deposits, and the reduction
of the gross receipt tax by one percentage point. Each subsequent year
that the target is met, the Government will seek to further reduce the GRT
by one additional percentage point.
c. Improving Debt Collection and Insolv*ancy Law and Procedures.
(i)   Amend laws and Procedures governing debt recovery and real
estate mortgaMes.    Under current law and procedures, it is
extremely time consuming to foreclose a real estate mortgage. A
harmful result of the present law and procedures has been to
make banks reluctant to engage in long term secured lending.
Instead, banks lend on a renewable short-term basis, preferring
to have the assured right of not renewing a loan rather than the
security of a mortgage which may be difficult to foreclose. We
recognize that measures are needed to streamline the law and
practice in this area.
It is -intended that the redemption period under judicial
foreclosures will be reduced from the current 12 months to 6
months. In order to reduce the risk of substantial
deterioration in the value of the foreclosed assets and in order
to permit expeditious determination of issues during
negotiations for redemption, arbitration and a summary procedure
will be proposed. The differentiation between bank and nonbank
mortgages in the case of bank foreclosures will be proposed for
elimination so that no redemption period will be allowed
following a judicial foreclosure even though the mortgagee is a
bank. In addition, access to courts after an extrajudicial
foreclosure will be limited.
(ii) Amendment to bankruptcy laws. We believe that there are a
number of deficiencies in the current insolvency and
reorganization laws. The Government, therefore, intends to
pursue revision in the appropriate legislation in order to
accomplish the following objectives: (a) the process of
reorganization will be accorded adequate protection from
subversion by seizure of assets by creditors, (b) the courts
will be given explicit administrative authority to enable the
debtor enterprises to continue operations while the
reorganization proceeds, and (c) the Securities and Exchange
Commission or another agency will unambiguously have the power
to appoint a trustee.

Page 8 of 9
A special task force to undertake the work indicated in (i) and (ii)
-above has been constituted with instructions to complete its assignment by
December 31, 1989.
d. Required Reserves and Interest Paid Thereon.
The policy of the Central Bank governing interest paid on reserves
is being reviewed within the broader perspective of monetary policy needs
and the level of required reserves. The Central Bank will share with the
World lank the results of such a review before the end of 1989.
In this connection, the Monetary Board has agreed to consider
increasing, over a period of time, the present rate of interest being paid
on the cash portion of required reserves actually kept in deposit with the
Central Bank.
4. Institutional Framework for Mobilization and Delivery of Term Credit.
(a) The Central Bank's Role in Credit Allocation Programs. In
the past, the Central Bank has in certain cases been directly involved in
managing credit allocation programs and has accordingly borrowed and lent
funds in its own name. We have concluded that the Central Bank should be
phased out of credit allocation programs.
Accordingly, an agreement between the Central Bank and the
Department of Agriculture has alr2ady been concluded to transfer all
agricultural credit programs (except ALF) currently under Central Bank
management to the Consolidated Agricultural Loan Fund. As for the transfer
of ALF, the Government is considering the Land Bank or another appropriate
financial institution except DBP.
As far as the industrial sector programs are concerned (Apex and
IGLF), our intention is to transfer them to the Development Bank of the
Philippines (DBP). The Monetary Board and the Board of Directors of DBP
have passed formal resolutions approving the transfe:- of Apex and IGLF
programs to DBP. Steps necessary to effect the transfer of the Apex
program have already been started. For the transfer of the IGLF program, a
committee constituted by the Central Bank (including a representative of
DBP) is working out the details. The transfer is envisioned to take place
in a phased fashion.
(b) Onlending Rates. The Government recognizes that for efficient
resource allocation, interest rates need to be left to be determined by the
markets. Accordingly, the Government has in recent years moved to market-
oriented onlending rates in respect of government sponsored or supported
credit programs. The Government affirms that onlending rates will continue
to be market-oriented for all credit programs for which funds are obtained
in the first instance by the Government or with the support or guarantee of
the Government, irrespective of the source of funds or their cost.



-48-                       ANEX 2
Page 9 of 9
(c)  Reorientation of DBP.   In order to reform the institutional
'framework for the mobilization and delivery of term credit, the operational
orientation of DBP will be significantly changed from being a retail
lending institution to a predominantly wholessle bank. Towards this end,
DBP will be the main conduit for onlending of official funds obtained by
the Government for the private sector, and such funds will be made
available for onlending by DBP on a wholesale basis. The Board of
Directors of DBP is favorably considering a Policy Statement which spells
out this new operational orientation, and it is expected that the Policy
Statement will be subsequently approved by the Department of Finance and
the Monetary Board.
A more detailed Institutional Development Plan has also been drawn
up by DBP and approved by its Board, which Plan spells out how the
operational objectives stated in the Policy Statement are to be achieved.
We expect the Plan to be diligently and expeditiously implemented.
In consideration of the financial sector adjustment measures that
have already been initiated and those that are expected to be implemented
in the near future, as discussed above, the Government of the Republic of
the Philippines would appreciate it if the World Bank would give favorable
consideration to this request for a US$300 million Financial Sector
Adjustment Loan. We will continue close consultations with the World Bank
as the reforms are implemented as we did when the reform package was being
designed.
Yours sincerely,
