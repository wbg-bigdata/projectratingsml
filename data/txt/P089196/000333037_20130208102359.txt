This ICR was prepared by Graham R. Smith (consultant) with a large contribution from Julian
Latimer Clarke, and under the guidance and supervision of Huot Chea (ICR Task Leader). We are
so grateful for all the great inputs from E. Aldaz-Carroll, M. Verghis, A. Sow, Brendan
O’Driscoll, S. Guimbert, L. Kong, L. Ky, A. Khiev, L. Lecuit, and S. Khiev. A list of people met
and interviewed during the ICR preparation is attached in Annex 9.

The ICR is based on a detailed desk review of materials from the project files, relevant
documents and information from Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Economy and Finance,
General Department of Customs and Excise, Council for the Development of Cambodia, Ministry
of Justice and the Supreme Court; and reports of the International Labor Organization (Better
Factories Cambodia), Emerging Markets Consulting, UNCTAC and Webb Fontaine (consulting
firms); and World Bank Aide Memoires. The ICR field mission (including field visits) took place
during May–June 2012, and the ICR also benefited from the stakeholder workshop (combined
with the final Project Steering Committee meeting) that took place on July 30th , 2012; and from
consultations with other Development Partners.

F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
“The Project Development Objective is to promote economic growth by reducing transaction costs
associated with trade and investment, introducing transparency in investment processes, and facilitating
access of enterprises to export markets?.

The following intermediate objectives were put in place to meet the PDOs:

   Reducing transaction costs associated with trade and investment: This aspect of the program focused
    on border reforms to trade facilitation practices and was headlined by the automation of customs
    procedures at border checkpoints. The intended objectives were satisfactorily achieved as the customs
    automation system was rolled out to most major customs sites, covering nearly 100% of customs
    transactions and associated declarations. The end result surpassed the intended target.
   Facilitating access of enterprises to export markets: A grants matching scheme known as the Export
    Market Access Fund (EMAF) was established to provide financing for SMEs to penetrate export
    markets that may otherwise have been closed to them. EMAF has made satisfactory progress in
    helping firms draft export development plans, and helping exporters to access new markets. Although
    the project assisted a number of firms across several sectors, with generally positive results. The
    results were extremely good in some sectors, less so in others. The objectives of this component were
    largely met.
   Introducing transparency in investment processes: An investor tracking system was introduced to the
    Cambodia Investment Board. The program was slow to start and met with some internal resistance

    was provided, and an automated system to track potential and current investors was put in.
   Legal Transparency: The legal transparency component was designed to provide potential investors
    with access to information about the judicial process in Cambodia as a means of reassuring foreign
    investors about the predictability of contract dispute settlement in Cambodia. The small amount of
    information provided by the Ministry of Justice led to mixed results.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The project was prepared in 2004 and 2005, starting from a first World Bank investment climate
assessment (ICA), released in 2004. At that time Cambodia’s economy, as well as its political systems
and administrative structures, were still recovering from a legacy of the decades of civil conflict of the
1970s and 1980s, and the gradual restoration of the rule of law. Most of the population (estimated at 80
percent) was rural and poor; one third of the total population of 13.4 million lived below the poverty line
of $0.46-$0.63 per day. The garment industry, which started up in around 1995, grew at a remarkable
pace, to reach exports of approximately $2 billion in 2004, employing over 270,000 people and
comprising 76 percent of all Cambodia’s exports – the remainder being mostly rice and other foodstuffs,
and tourism. However, infrastructure remained very inadequate for the modern domestic sectors and for
exports.

The 2004 Investment Climate Assessment provided evidence of many weaknesses in the functioning
of export markets. In response, the Royal Government of Cambodia took important measures to set up
consultation mechanisms to build trust between the public and private sectors, and to build consensus for
a national poverty reduction strategy. The present project is a consequence of that initiative, and the
demonstration of political will to address the many deficiencies prevailing in the existing supply chain
mechanisms – at the same time as Cambodia joined the World Trade Organization (in Oct. 2004).

The Government showed its commitment to improving the investment climate and to facilitating
trade by formulating a 12-point action plan and asking the World Bank to help in its
implementation (see Box 1). The Bank-assisted project was designed in such a way as to help the
Government implement many (but not all) of these 12 Actions. The Government sought the World
Bank’s assistance in this field, mindful of the Bank’s successful experience in trade facilitation projects
focusing on customs reform, modernization and computerization in several other countries and regions.

Box 1: Government of Cambodia’s 12-Point Action Plan to Improve the Investment
Climate and Facilitate Trade, (July 2004)
Action 1: Establish a cross-agency trade facilitation /investment climate reform team.
Action 2: Establish transparent performance measurement including private sector monitoring.
Action 3: The trade facilitation process, including all licenses, procedures and documents, will be
reviewed to remove overlaps and unnecessary approvals. Following the re-engineering, a Single
Administrative Document will be implemented and other documents progressively eliminated.
Action 4: Introduce an overall risk management strategy to consolidate and rationalize all
examination requirements of the different control agencies.
Action 5: A strategic review of the role of CamControl will be launched to more productively
deploy the organization’s unique knowledge of quality control processes and make optimized use
of inputs and resources from other agencies, such as CED [Customs].
Action 6: A Single Window process to manage trade facilitation will be piloted in the Port of
Sihanoukville by December 2005. The Trade Facilitation process, once streamlined, will be
automated.
Action 7: The Government will introduce a WTO-compatible flat fee for service, and the service


                                                    15
will be defined by a service-level agreement. The fee structure will be public.
Action 8: Streamline the process and reduce the cost of incorporating with the Commercial
Register, which is maintained at the Office of the Clerk of the Commercial Court, and costs an
average of $650 and 30 days.
Action 9: Streamline the process for notifying the Ministry of Labor prior to hiring employees,
which costs $250 and 30 days to complete.
Action 10: Harmonize registration for VAT, income tax and company registration, using the
same form and resulting in the same unique identifier. This would facilitate information-sharing
across agencies.
Action 11: Implement a national award to promote good corporate citizenship in the private
sector.
Action 12: Monitoring and reporting will take place through the Private Sector Forum.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

“The Project’s objective was to support the Recipient’s strategy to promote economic growth by reducing
transaction costs associated with trade and investment, introducing transparency in investment processes,
and facilitating access of enterprises to export markets?.

Key indicators by which to measure achievement of this objective were as follows:

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
The PDO was not revised, but a few new baselines and target indicators were set after the 2009
restructuring to strengthen project performance.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

The main beneficiaries were expected to be traders (importers and exporters) and investors (domestic and
foreign). Secondary beneficiaries would be those finding jobs in the burgeoning export firms and
industries.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
The project financed several initiatives addressing the objective of facilitating both trade and investment
in the Cambodian economy. They were clustered into four components, primarily on the basis of the
Government agency responsible for managing the main activities (and in declining order of financial size).

Component 1: Trade Facilitation ($6.15 million): Information technology was to be applied to border
management activities, in the expectation that it would streamline operations, improve the level of
transparency and accountability, and facilitate the achievement of all border-related government
objectives. Accordingly, the project was to finance: (a) an electronic Single Window, integrating all trade
facilitation agencies, including the deployment of ICT for automation of customs functions, linked to
complementary improvements in systems, procedures and developments in the various organizations
involved in product clearance; (b) adherence to the Kyoto Convention (see below), including the adoption
of a risk management capacity; (c) design of a merit-based pay system for Cambodia’s trade regulatory
agencies; and (d) development of an Integrity Action Plan for the Customs and Excise Department2 based
on a self-assessment.

Box 2: The Trade Facilitation Agenda of the WCO’s revised Kyoto Convention (1999)
The revised International Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs
procedures (“Kyoto Convention?) was adopted in June 1999 as the blueprint for modern and
efficient Customs procedures in the 21st century. Once implemented widely, it will provide
international commerce with the predictability and efficiency that modern trade requires. The
revised Convention elaborates several key governing principles- chief among these are the
principles of:
   transparency and predictability of Customs actions;
   standardization and simplification of the goods declaration and supporting documents;
   simplified procedures for authorized persons;
   maximum use of information technology;
   minimum necessary Customs control to ensure compliance with regulations;
   use of risk management and audit-based controls;
   coordinated interventions with other border agencies;
   partnership with the trade.
The revised Kyoto Convention entered into force in 2006.

Component 2: Export Market Access Fund (EMAF) ($2.1 million): Support was to be provided to:
(a) the Ministry of Commerce’s Department of Export Promotion to set up a technical assistance window

                                                            
2
    Customs and Excise Department has later been changed to “General Department of Customs and Excise?


                                                               17
for exporters; and (b) a matching grant facility for private exporters, that would cover half of the cost of
achieving market standards, or evidence of compliance with those standards.
As a special case, the Garment Manufacturers’ Association of Cambodia (GMAC) applied for co-
financing over three years to finance the International Labour Organization’s Better Factories Cambodia
program to achieve socially responsible manufacturing standards.

Component 3: Private Participation in Infrastructure and Investment (PPI) ($1.2 million): To
implement the Law on Concessions and the Amended Law on Investment, a program of capacity building
would be carried out to improve the organizational capacity of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the
Council for Development of Cambodia (CDC), the National Audit Authority, infrastructure regulatory
bodies such as the Electricity Authority of Cambodia, and infrastructure line ministries, to manage and
deliver PPI transactions. The CDC and the Cambodia Investment Board would also be supported in
adopting strategies that would streamline the process of foreign direct investment and make Cambodia
more attractive as an investment destination, through improvements in the regulatory environment and in
factor markets.

Component 4: Legal Transparency ($0.4 million): (a) A website in the Khmer language would be set
up and maintained, to make available to the public the final judgments of all cases in the Supreme Court
and in the Court of Appeal. (b) Another website would be set up and maintained, to ensure the electronic
publication of all Cambodian laws, related regulations and draft legislation in the commercial law field.
(c) Training would be provided to use these systems, once set up. Publication of such information was to
contribute to increasing confidence in the capacity of the appellate courts to interpret, apply and enforce
Cambodian laws generally, and the commercial legal framework in particular, in a fair and consistent
manner. An increase in confidence in the transparency and predictability of judgments would reduce the
risk associated with private domestic and foreign investments.

1.6 Revised Components
The above components were to be implemented over four years from mid-2005 to mid-2009, with the
grant’s closing date set for December 1, 2009. Shortly before the end of this period (by that point only
about 40 percent of the grant was disbursed), the project was substantially restructured and the closing
date extended by 32 months to July 31, 2012. The restructuring was due in part to a difference of views
between the Government and the Bank on how the electronic Single Window should be set up and run.
The proposed restructuring reallocated resources from the sub-component on the electronic Single
Window (US$3.6 million) to (i) further extension of the customs automated system (comp. 1); (ii)
automation of Certificates of Origin (C/O) issuance (comp. 1); and (iii) creation of a Trade
Information Website (TIW, comp. 4)3. Early during project implementation, the Government indicated
its decision not to proceed with the institutional model initially envisaged for the creation of a Single
Window. However, it remained committed to offering much of the functionality initially envisaged under
such a Single Window, building on the platform of the customs automated system (the so-called
Automated System for Customs Data, or ASYCUDA). The proposed restructuring supported this new
approach through redeploying resources that will support further deployment of the customs automated
system (US$2.5 million), the automation of Certificates of Origin (one of the critical trade-related
processes, especially for the garment industry, US$0.2 million), and the dissemination of trade-related
information on a new TIW (US$0.7 million). Other resources were redeployed to continue support to
trade-related labor standards in the garment industries (“Better Factories Cambodia?) and additional
training4.

1.7 Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule,
and funding allocations)

This restructuring also took into account the slower-than-expected implementation of the Customs
automation component. The Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA World), developed and
marketed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), was adopted as the
border checkpoint solution. Several factors made for a slow start-up in the procurement of hardware and
advisory services, as well as the gradual roll out of the system to the various facilities of additional
Customs checkpoints. An extension of the closing allowed GDCE to substantially complete its roll-out.
Several of the sub-components suffered long delays, and extra time was important for achieving the
intended results. The project made good progress in implementing the ASYCUDA and rolling it out to
checkpoints, to the extent that it now covers nearly 100 percent of customs declaration application
processes.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their mitigations
identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

The Project’s original design was innovative and ambitious, and, in hindsight, it is clear that it stretched
the Government’s limited implementation capacity, especially regarding all the IT components. As
regards the proposed electronic Single Window, the project design presumed a degree of maturity and
cooperation among the various interested government bodies, that experience subsequently showed was
lacking. The initial proposal to install an electronic Single Window came from within the Government,
modeled on the Singaporean model, and which other ASEAN members sought to emulate as part of their
community commitment. Experience showed that it was too broad and complex a concept to implement
from scratch in a country at Cambodia’s stage of institutional development. Instead, the restructuring
allowed the two main agencies involved in trade and investment – the Ministry of Commerce, and the
General Department of Customs and Excise (under the Ministry of Economy and Finance) — to each
develop its own capacity to set up and manage electronic data systems and websites, with a view to
achieving a national single window at some future date. The trade information website and automation of
Certification of Origin (under the Ministry of Commerce) never materialized due to procurement delays.
The ICT deployment of ASYCUDA (under the GDCE) has been a success, however.

2.2 Implementation

A mid-term review was held in May 2008, a year later than planned at appraisal. Overall the review found
overall encouraging progress on customs automation and risk management,5 in particular with the launch
of ASYCUDA World at the port of Sihanoukville in May 2008, presided over by the Prime Minister of
Cambodia. Sihanoukville is the country largest seaport, where some 50 percent of all imports enter
Cambodia, making it GDCE’s most important border checkpoint.

The mid-term review concluded that the PDO remained relevant, but it recommended a minor
restructuring that was adopted with effect from August that year: funds were reallocated to (a)

 Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) supported risk management implementation and Australian Aid
(AusAID) supported the drafting of the risk management strategy


                                                               19
development of the Trade Information Website and ICT master plan for the Ministry of Commerce and
(b) further support to the ILO’s Better Factories Cambodia program. After that minor restructuring in
2008, GDCE requested Bank support to undertake a detailed review of ASYCUDA implementation in
March 2009. Concerns about its quality were largely addressed during that evaluation process, and a
baseline evaluation was conducted in October of the same year. The conclusions and lessons of the
evaluation were then incorporated into the project restructuring that took place later in 2009.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The M&E design was designed to capture appropriate information about each component of the program.
Each component will be dealt with in turn in this section.

Component 1: Trade Facilitation. This component relied on measurements of the ease of goods
movements extrapolated from figures and data that captured the reduction in cost and transit time for
imports into or exports from Cambodia. The overall goal of this component was to bring Cambodia into
conformity with its commitments to the WTO and ASEAN. The second goal of this component was to
enhance the business climate by increasing transparency and predictability of the trade regime and to
address governance concerns related to the imposition of informal or ad hoc payments and processes.
The indicators were therefore chosen to reflect progress towards these goals – such as transit time,
percentage of goods inspected, and number of document and percentage of goods transacted under the
automated system. The data was taken from standard World Bank products such as the Investment
Climate Assessments (ICAs) and the Doing Business Report.

Component 2: Export Market Access Fund. This component was designed with the overall goal of
enhancing the ability of the private sector to create new export markets for their goods. The means by
which this goal was to be achieved was through (i) a system of matching grants to exporters for them to
promote their goods in overseas markets, (ii) develop rational and succinct export development plans. The
number of plans generated and the amount disbursed in matching grants were appropriate outcome
indicators for this component. A large part of this component was devoted to funding the Better Factories
Cambodia program, managed by the International Labour Organization (ILO), which led to growth in
exports by fostering corporate social responsibility. The link between corporate responsibility, higher
investment and enhanced exports was not adequately captured in the results indicators. Gender dimenions
of this component could have been measured by estimating the number of female owned companies that
benefitted from the grants and the number of female employees hired in factories under the Better
factories program.

Component 3: Private Participation in Infrastructure and Investment. This component was designed to
encourage private sector participation in infrastructure projects and sharpen the RGC response to the
needs of potential investors and investors already in Cambodia. Progress in this component was hampered
by corporate governance issues surrounding the projects that were proposed for private sector
participation and, more recently, the project was held back by a complicated country relationship lowered
the RGC’s incentive to fully engage on this issue, especially with respect to the sometimes controversial
topic of concessions. On the investment side, the RGC updated the existing investor databases and
received technical assistance in the form of consultant support to establish and upgrade the Investor
Tracking and Aftercare Center. The indicators for public private investment were never met for the
reasons mentioned above and therefore the indicator was redundant. On the investment side, Cambodia’s
ranking in the Global Investment Promotion Benchmarking did not improve due to slow progress in
rolling out the investor tracking project. The indicator may have been poorly chosen, however, as an
independent survey of foreign investors (the Foreign Investor Perception Survey) showed an
improvement in investor perception of the role of Cambodia’s Investment Board during this period.


                                                   20
Component 4: Legal Transparency. The component was designed to increase legal transparency by
making the final judgments of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals publicly available in Khmer
language. The results indicator was based on revealing how many decisions had been disclosed as a
proportion of the total number of relevant judgments. Although the results indicator was simple and
robust, the result was compromised by the inability of the task team to determine the total number of
judgments issued by the courts. Without the total number of judgments, the degree of transparency
(measured as a percentage of overall judgments) was impossible to determine. The task team’s best
estimate, therefore, was that “less than 30%? of the judgments were made publicly available (for example,
court cases after 1997 were never publicly available.) The indicator was therefore valid only to the extent
that the overall number of judgments would be made available to the task team.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Procurement: Procurement faced repeated challenges including shortages of qualified consulting firms
and suppliers to bid for project packages, due to the very specialized nature of the consulting services and
goods respectively required for the project. The complex nature of the core customs software and
systems, meant that only a few private consulting firms knew the systems, and not many of them firms
were willing to bid on a project in Cambodia, which raised a fundamental challenge for procurement of
the development of the software and system package. Therefore, a UN Agency – UNCTAD - that
developed ASYCUDA software and made it available to governments without charge, was selected on a
single source basis to develop the first phase of the system and subsequently train the client staff in its use.
Later phases of the system roll-out, and capacity building for the client staff were procured competitively,
although certain ‘middleware’ required for the system had to be procured from a sole supplier using the
direct contracting method. The procurement to supply a system for automating issuance of Certificates of
Origin at the Ministry of Commerce elicited only a few bids, all which were rejected as non-compliant or
non-responsive. Re-bidding of this package delayed implementation, and it could not be completed by the
time of project closure. The package was eventually supported under the Trade Development Support
Program (TDSP), which is a multi-donor funded trade program managed by the World Bank. Complaints
were received about the procurement in the first round, and the Bank team handled those complaints
according to the Bank’s applicable complaint handling procedures.

In December 2007, an Independent Procurement Agent (IPA) was recruited by the Government to carry
out procurement under all Bank–financed projects in Cambodia, following instances of fraud and
corruption identified in other projects in the portfolio. After a difficult start-up phase, which resulted in
the recruitment of another firm in 2009, the coordination between the IPA and the implementing agency
has improved.

Disbursement: Disbursement was slow before the 2009 restructuring, but picked up quickly after
restructuring. The cumulative disbursement at the closing date is close to 100 percent of the total
allocated grant proceeds, which can be mainly attributed to progress of the customs automation expansion.

Financial Management: Throughout the implementation period, financial management has been
satisfactory. No significant issues have arisen. Quarterly financial monitoring reports (FMR) were
generally submitted by the due date, except for few instances where the submission was late for a couple
of days. Annual audited financial statements, together with management letters, have generally been
submitted on a timely basis. Internal audits have been duly conducted, as well as external audits.
Following the project failure to sign an auditor contract for the final audit before the project closing date
(July 31, 2012), exceptional approval was granted by the Bank to allow the final audit fee to be eligible,
even though the audit contract was not signed before project closing date. The final audited financial
statements, containing an unqualified (clean) opinion, were delivered to the Bank on time.



                                                      21
Safeguards: Environmental and social safeguard issues have not arisen, as the project activity involves
only installation of IT systems and related equipment at established sites, and technical assistance. The
project triggered no safeguard policies.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
A few technical assistance contracts need to be continued beyond the extended closing date of July 31,
2012. It has been agreed that funding for these contracts will, as far as possible, be continued under the
on-going World Bank-supported Trade Development Support Program (TDSP). The main candidates are
(a) the local team of IT specialists helping the General Department of Customs and Excise (GDCE)
complete the last few functions (Direct Trader Inputs, and transit function) of the ASYCUDA World and
to cover the postponed automation of Certification of Origin and Trade Information Website at the
Ministry of Commerce.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The design of the project responded well to the aims of the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP
2006-2010), of improving the competitiveness of country’s labor-intensive industries and their exports;
building a more conducive climate for the private sector to flourish;, and, generally facilitating trade,
through simplification of trading and investment processes, bringing greater transparency and better
governance to regulatory agencies, and building investor confidence. The project development objective
captured these aims succinctly. The project’s implementation kept focus on this objective, while
adjusting the mix of components as needed.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
The contribution of the project to the promotion of economic growth, and the reduction of associated
trade and investment costs (which is the higher order objective included in the PDO formulation), can be
measured indirectly through the improved GDP growth and improvements in investors perception of
Cambodia. Economic growth averaged 7.9% p.a. over the project life period (which was high). Between
2004 and 2012 the number of firms reporting corruption as a moderate, major or severe problem declined
from 74% to 53% (exceeding the target of 10 percentage point decline). Based on the more focused
indicator introduced in the 2009 restructuring, the share of traders considering "Customs and Trade" as a
severe or very severe constraint declined from 19.1% in 2009 to 5% in 2012 (also exceeding a target of
15% of traders).

More specifically, the achievement of the Project Development Objective can be assessed along the three
detailed dimensions included in the PDO formulation:
     reducing transaction costs associated with trade and investment;
     facilitating access of enterprises to export markets; and
     introducing transparency into the investment process.

Reducing transaction costs associated with trade and investment
The project’s main material benefit has been the reduction of associated costs, times and more predictable
and accountable processes for Customs to clear import/export declarations and release the goods; related
simplification of trade documents and procedures; and greater consistency and transparency in how the
responsible government agencies treat traders. The computerized customs clearance system (ASYCUDA
World) yielded great success in expediting clearance processes, with less physical interaction with
customs officers. This also reflects Government’s commitment to the Kyoto Convention trade facilitation
agenda. As a result, growth of trade has been strong, showing 126% increase from 2004 to 2012; customs

growth, averaging 7.9% p.a. over the 2004-2012 period.

     Projection

Before the existence of the project, customs clearance at the country's biggest seaport (Sihanoukville)
involved multiple steps, documents and hours of waiting that led to lost opportunity of trade and growth.
Today, all process goes with a single electronic document (called "Single Administrative Document" or
SAD) being deployed at most major customs checkpoints, covering nearly 100 percent of customs
declaration clearances. The largest motivational benefit has been the creation of incentives and rewards
for ‘good behavior’ on the part of traders, in response to the risk-based management system now applied
throughout customs transactions. The ‘green channel/red channel’ concept was new to Cambodian border
agencies, but good progress has been made, and the idea of ‘trustworthy traders’ has taken root, and is
likely to be embodied formally into a system of ‘authorized economic operators’ on the EU model.

Although export processing times continued to improve after implementation of ASYCUDA, the time for
imports has not immediately decreased. This is not an uncommon result of automation (Indonesia has had
a similar experience with their national single window) and can be attributed to the following issues: (i) it
takes time for users to familiarize themselves with the system, (ii) there are some modular components of
the automated solution that are still missing, such as direct trader input. Both factors significantly affect
time.

Another outcome associated with the program has been reflected in the latest World Bank logistics
performance ranking in 2012 (LPI 2012), that displayed an improvement of 28 rankings in Cambodia’s
position vis-à-vis other countries in the LPI 2012. This makes Cambodia the 12th fastest reformer in the

 The fact that customs clearance time for imports has not fallen fast enough despite ASYCUDA implementation is
unexpected, but it is not an uncommon result of automation (Indonesia had a similar experience with their
automation). It takes time for users to familiarize themselves with the system, and also there are some parts of the
automation that are still not fully functional, including some that really affect import time, such as the Direct Trader
Input (that allows traders to input data from their firms rather than from the port or customs sites).


                                                                                23
world over two years, one of the star performers among Low-Income Countries (9th place) and the only
country of the East Asia region to witness such a dramatic improvement in its trade logistics performance.
Various international studies indicate the significant contributions of trade logistics on competitiveness.

Sub-Component 1 – automation of Certificates of Origin issuance – has not fully achieved its objective
due to a failed procurement (as indicated above) and this component will be achieved instead under the
multi-donor trade facility that is managed by the World Bank, called TDSP. However, under the present
project, the procedures were substantially simplified and streamlined prior to automation.

As a result, the contribution of the AYSCUDA system outweighs some of the few shortcomings
discussed above, and the achievement of this part of the PDO is considered to be satisfactory.

Facilitating access of enterprises to export markets
The EMAF matching grants component encouraged small firms to become exporters by (i) providing
technical assistance to draft business plans and (ii) providing matching grants for exporters to promote
their products overseas and thereby facilitate the growth of export markets. Over the implementation
period, EMAF has promoted exports, succeeded in opening new markets and encouraged new exporters
and a greater variety of exported products. Firms that benefitted from grants estimate that they will
generate $274.50 for every $1 granted. Female owned companies constituted 33% of EMAF clients and
new exporters accounted for 16% of all EMAF clients. The results showed that the return on matching
grants was much higher in some sectors (such as rice) than others, leading to the conclusion that an
EMAF-style program that focuses on a single sector may exhibit higher returns.

A special component of this component was the ILO’s Better Factories Cambodia initiative, which
provided reassurance to large foreign buyers as to the social responsibility of factories located in
Cambodia. This led to a rapid increase in exports as factories received large orders from international
companies for export to overseas markets. The project had an indirect impact on corporate social
responsibility among garment factory managers regarding the wages and working conditions of their
labor force (mostly young women) and through a quality assurance scheme that has gained the industry
wider and deeper access to leading retail chains in the USA and European markets. The sustainability of
the Better Factories program increased steadily during the program. By 2011, more than 50% of the
program budget was earned from factory subscriptions and support from key industry groups rather than
from development partners.

Garment exports - the country’s largest foreign exchange earner - rose from US$2 billion in 2004 to US$4
billion in 2011 and are projected to reach US$4.6 billion in 2012. The industry employed 350,000
workers, with US$35 million spent for workers’ monthly wages. Industrial manufacturing continues to be
dominated by garment manufacturing, which contributed 26.8% of GDP in 2005 and 28.4% of GDP at
the time of project closure.

As a result the achievement of this part of the PDO is considered to be moderately satisfactory.

Introducing transparency in the investment process
Overall the project has been less successful in introducing transparency in the investment process. Under
Component 3, managed by the Council for Development of Cambodia (CDC), a Concessions Law was
developed and adopted by parliament. Relevant officials were trained, but no transactions involving
private participation in infrastructure (PPI) have been piloted under the new law. This is not altogether
surprising, as the preparation of the legal framework and procedures, and the corresponding training, were
overtaken by the global financial crisis of 2009-2010, which deterred such investment in emerging
markets (Cambodia’s FDI inflow fell to its lowest point in four years during the financial crisis,


                                                    24
accounting for only 5% of GDP in 2009). It was not even possible to pilot a low risk operation under this
component.

Similarly, the Investment Tracking System's roll-out to departments of CDC had not been effected by the
project’s closing date. The Investor Tracking System can be considered operational in one key department
only (the Project Evaluation and Incentives Department.

Associated with the slow progress demonstrated under this component, Cambodia's Ranking in the Global
Investment Promotion Benchmarking 2012 fell to 28% (well short of the PDO target of 50%). This fall in
ratings indicates that Cambodia performance was weaker relative to its peers and may be correlated with
the meager results of this component of the project..

The last activity, under Component 4, aimed at disseminating important information to potential investors
about the rule of law and civil and criminal judgments, has had little discernible impact. The websites for
the Ministry of Justice http://www.moj.gov.kh/ and the Supreme Court http://www.supremecourt.gov.kh/
have been set up and are accessible online. Successful training sessions have also been conducted. But the
volume and content of information available on those websites falls well short of expectations. Those
sites are supposed to make all cases available to the public. Despite an encouraging start made by the
Supreme Court in posting a selection of its civil and criminal judgment cases up to 1997, no cases after
that date have been made publicly available. Even the total number of cases processed by the courts
during that period is unavailable, therefore an estimate of the publicly available cases as a proportion of
the total number of court cases (less than 30%) has been used here (the Ministry of Justice has promised
to continue updating the website with translated court cases in future); Despite recent transparency
measures enacted by Ministry of Justice include releasing updated hearing schedules to the public and
improving the Ministry of Justice's web site, the volume of information remains short of the targeted PDO.
The Trade Information Website (TIW), which was added to this component during the 2009 restructuring,
to be administered by the Ministry of Commerce, was not established before the project closing date. This
latter component will be completed under the World Bank-managed Trade Development Support
Program. As a result, the achievement of this part of the PDO is considered to be unsatisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

The nature of many of the project’s components makes it hard, for several reasons, to calculate a net
present value, or an economic rate of return, not least because of the difficulty of defining a plausible
counter-factual: what would have happened in the absence of the project. The PAD included such an
analysis for simplification of the import process. Studies indicated that every day of delay caused by red
tape increases production costs by 1 percent. In general, improving logistics performance of low income
countries to the level of middle income countries will increase trade on average by 15 percent 7 . A
quantitative analysis of historical data by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD), estimates that, on average, each day saved results in an economic gain equal to the value of
0.5% of imports8. The indicated reduction of the number of documents and clearances, along with risk-
based inspection processes and lowered perception of corruption in trade, have shown great economic
return. Time of import was not reduced since the project restructuring, but it fell 1.4 days compared to the
time at approval9.

  The fact that customs clearance time for imports has not fallen fast enough despite ASYCUDA implementation is
unexpected but it is not an uncommon result of automation (Indonesia had a similar experience with their
Automation) as it takes time for users to familiarize themselves with the system, and also there are some parts of the

                                                               25
The most efficient outcome of the project was the introduction of the customs automation system. That
led to institutional and systemic changes in the General Department of Customs and Excise (GDCE) –
both in the way it operates and clears imports and exports – leaving no doubt that the economic and
financial return will be very high. The automation of Customs procedures makes compliance easier, since
the previous array of officials and agencies was replaced by an automated system, requiring a single entry
of information and decreasing opportunities for discretion, direct interface, and corruption.

On the aim of export promotion with matching grants, EMAF surpassed the target by supporting 65 firms
and associations (representing small and medium enterprises) to prepare draft export plans, 13 of which
are new exporters (short of the 30-firm target). EMAF is helpful in the context of Cambodia, as the export
community suffers from the lack of trade finance/export credit, due to the high interest rates of
commercial banks, and the absence of a domestic Exim Bank, or other guarantee facilities such as are
available in some other countries.

Another indicator, not included at appraisal, is the value of incremental exports achieved, relative to the
cost of managing the program (cost of international consulting firm), and each dollar disbursed by the
Government to beneficiaries. The international consulting firm evaluated proposals, provided technical
assistance to the beneficiaries, and helped prepare the firms’ export plans. Despite the successful outcome,
it leaves open the question of whether the consultant could have set up and tested a ‘model’ approach; so
that similar benefits could have been achieved at less operating cost, by relying more on Ministry of
Commerce staff rather than the international consulting firm, whose fee was nearly double the amount of
all EMAF disbursements to beneficiaries.

Another key beneficiary of the EMAF was the ILO’s Better Factories Cambodia (BFC) program, which
assessed working conditions in about 350 apparel factories with employment of some 350,000 workers.
Its staff offers a regular menu of 10 different training courses, in addition to advisory services. Monitoring
labor and working conditions, and reporting to buyers, provided the quality assurance that has gained the
industry access to the US and European retailers. But the BFC remains largely reliant on donor funding
(54% in 2011 and expected to fall to 30% in 2012). It is advisable for BFC to develop a detailed transition
strategy that includes a feasible plan for achieving full sustainability in the future (not dependent on
donors).

The US Trade Representative, Mr. Ron Kirk, visited Cambodia in August 2012, and participated in the
ASEAN–US Business Forum. He applauded Cambodia on doing well with its administration and
leadership, by putting in place and adding to the number of labor protection agreements in the textile
industry - which has greatly enhanced Cambodia’s attractiveness to US companies 10 . Despite these
encouraging outcomes, the project has been less efficient in promoting transparency in investment
processes, as illustrated earlier.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: moderately satisfactory

Overall, the achievements of the two parts of the PDO (reducing transaction costs associated with trade
and investment, and facilitating access of enterprises to export markets) outweighs the shortcomings in
the last part of the PDO (introducing transparency in investment process). This is confirmed by the fact
                                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                               
automation are still not fully functional, the ones that really affect import time such as the Direct Trader Input (that
allows traders to input data from their firms rather than from the port or customs sites).

that the target for the PDO indicator was exceeded. Given the overall continued relevance of the PDO,
and the fact that efficiency is considered moderately satisfactory, the overall outcome rating is considered
Moderately Satisfactory.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The customs automation led to improving the trade facilitation environment and, in turn, contributed to
increased exports of rice, garments and handicrafts, all of which rely for labor predominantly on the rural
population (by definition poor), low-income urban dwellers, and women (both rural and urban). The
Better Factories Cambodia initiative likewise has improved labor conditions where poor segments of
society are employed, including large numbers of women (83 percent of this workforce)11.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening


The automation of Customs has substantially enhanced the capacity and professionalism of customs
officers by introducing institutional reform and systemic change of the agency. It has built momentum for
reform and modernization. When the project was started in 2004 there was no automation, no green/red/
yellow channels, no risk management, and intense rivalry between approval agencies, each of which were
reluctant to relinquish direct contact with traders. The system has now helped to streamline and facilitate
many of these procedures.

While the EMAF matching grant was a useful tool to help shape the vision and design strategy of
businesses to access export markets, it remains unsustainable without financial support from development
partners, as the Government’s fiscal position remains weak.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
A stakeholder workshop was held on July 30th 2012 at the Sunway Hotel, Phnom Penh, with some 70
participants and was also joined by Project Steering Committee members. The workshop was organized
by the General Department of Customs and Excise, with representatives from all customs directors of the
automated customs sites; and representatives from government line ministries, Chamber of Commerce,
private sector, transport and freight forwarders association, national project team members, technical
advisory group members, PIU and donors (mainly World Bank, ADB, JICA, AusAID and EU) and the
experts from the IT consulting firm, Webb Fontaine.
Progress of the ASYCUDA system was presented by the project director, documenting the success of
having the automated system run smoothly with coverage of nearly 100 percent of customs declaration
process; and the risk management system is also in place, running alongside the system. The customs
representatives rated themselves as satisfactory in the achievement of their objectives, with some
challenges remaining to be addressed such as direct trade input, manifest and transit functions. The Royal
Government of Cambodia thanked the World Bank and other development partners who participated and
assisted the GDCE in its Reform Strategy 2009-2013, of which customs automation is part. The customs
representatives concluded by saying that the computerization helped reduce documentation and time and

improved trade facilitation with clearance procedures becoming more expeditious and transparent, and
revenue increasing12.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant
The risk associated with sustainability of the customs automation system remains high as it involves high
operation costs, for example the costs of outsourcing work to local IT consultants, software maintenance
and upgrades in the case where a new version is released. However, there have been indications of strong
will and commitment from the government to pursue its reform and modernization strategy. The
government revealed that the system had become comfortable now and it had reached a point of no return
(to manual processes). The strong political will from the government would help mitigate many of the
risks and challenges. In addition, the continuous support from the Trade Development Support Program
(TDSP) played an important role in helping maintain and sustain the system after the project ended, and
would help update the system should it have a new version from the software owner (UNCTAD).

On the other hand, the feedback from the private sector (such as the Second Investment Climate
Assessment and the views summarized in from Annex 8) points out the continuing concern of traders and
investors regarding the quality of governance and transparency in key parts of the Government (despite
the finding that their perception of corruption fell from 74 percent in 2004 to 53 percent in 2012).
However, this will likely be mitigated by the establishment of formal consultation mechanisms between
the government and the private sector. These include the Government - Private Sector Forum13 held semi-
annually and chaired by the Prime Minister; the Customs-Private Sector Partnership Mechanism that
meets quarterly; and other relevant Technical Working Groups that meet regularly or on urgent basis.
These mechanisms have been taken seriously by both sides over recent years, and have removed many
obstacles and solved multiple trade-related issues.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry


Rating: Moderately satisfactory

Feedback from the Government tells us that the Bank was seen as helpful in designing an innovative
project, responsive to the Government’s priority needs and capacity. At the same time, it should have
been recognized at appraisal that a Single Window, while effective and valued in countries with high-
performing public institutions, such as Japan and Singapore, would demand far more than could
reasonably be expected of it when proposed for a far poorer country with weak government capacity and
poor governance. The project was also overly ambitious in scale, given counterpart capacity and the
complexity of the components to be supervised.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

Implementation of the project spanned seven Bank fiscal years. Over those seven years 16 Bank
supervision missions filed ISRs, and Aide-memoires recorded their findings and were shared with the
Government after consultation. This frequency of supervision was adequate. 2009 was a year of intensive
attention while the restructuring was being defined and negotiated. Since March 2008 the Task Team
Leader has been based in Phnom Penh, allowing close and frequent exchanges with the various
implementing agencies, which facilitated the Mid-Term Review of May 2008, and led to the key
restructuring in 2009, that addressed some of the design flaws.



(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory – This rating integrates the quality at entry (MS) and the quality of
supervision (S).

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The Government has been an active partner in defining the project content, and in assigning
implementation to motivated, generally competent agencies, supported by coordinating committees and
other mechanisms to ensure the involvement of all relevant public–sector bodies, and by formal
consultation mechanisms (mentioned above) that give voice to the private sector and stakeholders.
Regular progress reports were submitted to the Bank (including FM and audit reports). In addition, close
cooperation and support was provided by all the relevant government agencies to all implementation
support missions, including the ICR mission.



(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The project teams of the GDCE and the Ministry of Commerce (on the EMAF segment, not on CO
automation) have performed satisfactorily, even highly satisfactorily in some respects. On the other hand,
the implementation performance of the project teams of the Ministry of Justice and the Supreme Court
has been considered by the ICR team as moderately unsatisfactory, because of long delays in setting up
their respective websites and uploading content. Similarly, the ICR team has viewed the Council for
Development of Cambodia (CDC) performance as unsatisfactory, due to its failure to introduce PPI pilot
activity and to roll out the Investment Tracking System, a failure which largely resulted from coordination
issues rather than design flaws in the project. The Ministry of Economy and Finance have been extremely
supportive over the project life period, and actively engaged in problem solving and in facilitating all
processes effectively.



(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory



                                                    29
The quality of performance has varied among the several implementing agencies. This rating is a
weighted average of them all, and of the four components.

6. Lessons Learned


 1. Computerization of customs has introduced significant changes. The radical reduction in the number
    of documents – from 44 during the time of project design to 11 documents14 during mid-term review
    (in 2008) – show the value of automation in motivating a coordinated simplification of trade
    procedures and the elimination of overlapping permits and other documents, as a prerequisite to the
    automation itself. Another major accomplishment by the GDCE is the successful implementation of
    an automated risk management system that has radically reduced the frequency of physical
    inspection of imported shipments, from 100% to fewer than 20%, – approaching what is generally
    considered international good practice, namely 10-15%. One complication that has yet to be resolved
    is that JICA designed one set of risk management criteria, which GDCE adopted early in the project
    implementation period, while UNCTAD, through ASYCUDA, designed another set, and on occasion
    the two sets give varying results. It is appropriate that GDCE should adjust its risk management
    criteria periodically in the light of on-going experience, and taking into account the frequency of
    fraud and other irregularities. But the essence of the automation is that traders with a good track
    record should be rewarded with predictable, favorable treatment.

2. Risks associated with IT projects are normally higher than most Bank projects that finance
   infrastructure and services. Procurement is more demanding, because of concerns about intellectual
   property rights, and the limited number of suppliers and of qualified consultants. Delivering such a
   project to a government with very limited institutional capacity is taking a big risk, but, thanks to the
   support and strong commitment from the government, it was eventually achieved, despite some over-
   reach – such as financing the electronic single window, which was later dropped to focus on customs
   automation. A key lesson for future similar activity, would be to focus on designing a less ambitious
   project that fully takes into account the client’s capacity.

3. The higher risk can sometimes produce higher return; the success of customs automation has led to
   systemic and institutional changes in the way customs clearance is operated. IT may be a good tool
   for institutional and structural changes. It can bring about a more transparent and predictable way of
   conducting transactions which can lead to growth of trade and of the economy. The crucially
   important factor in this success was the strong ground team, with close and frequent exchanges with
   the client. The Bank may not want to implement the same type of project in a country where there
   isn't such a strong field presence.

 4. This kind of customs automation/modernization project serves and supports the backbone of the
    private sector, and Cambodia’s national poverty reduction strategy emphases that the private sector is
    the engine of economic growth. The project responded well to that. It may be useful for other LDCs
    to learn from that approach.

5. Another lesson was learned when stakeholders in this project accused the Bank of excessive rigidity
   in its management of procurement, resulting several times in the rejection of all bids. In such cases
   rebidding delayed implementation by 6-12 months, which has been costly to the Government.

6. The EMAF matching grant system can be effective in encouraging and supporting innovative efforts
   of the private sector to expand exports and access new markets. However, designing and

                                                               30
    implementing the approach to be applied may involve substantial testing and learning on the part of
    the agency charged with evaluating the grant requests. Ample time should be allowed for the
    development and testing. The future lesson might be to simplify the process and involve the Ministry
    in the entire process, so as to increase capacity and sustainability, instead of employing consulting
    firms to screen proposals, which makes the activity unsustainable if not financed continuously by
    DPs. As mentioned above, fees for the international consulting firm was nearly double the amount of
    EMAF disbursements to beneficiaries. However, given the high risk environment, the project teams
    of both Bank and Government have delivered a very good outcome. As the government has gained a
    lot of experience from this innovative practice and had there been sufficient time for longer
    implementation of EMAF (i.e. 5 years), the operating cost of managing the process by using a
    consulting firm would have been much lower, and efficiency would have been much greater. This
    reflects the conclusion in the final EMAF-II report, pointing to the benefits of having a longer
    timescale in order to allow EMAF to work with less developed companies. This is important, because
    the decision to export for the first time is necessarily a strategic decision for companies’ management.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Grantee/Implementing Agencies/Donors

(a) Grantee/Implementing agencies

The government has prepared its own implementation completion report (ICR). On their own initiative,
an international individual consultant was hired as their main author. The report is of high quality: very
thorough, well documented, thoughtful in its evaluations, and drawing its own conclusions and
recommendations for future priorities. This gives grounds for optimism that what has been achieved so far
will be sustained, and indeed expanded. The government view is that progress made in the Trade
Facilitation (component 1) and Export Market Access Fund (component 2) was satisfactory, and that led
to an overall outcome rating of satisfactory in their ICR. The position is supported by the fact that
development objectives of many key actions have been met or are close to being met, and by including
progress that is not monitored by the indicators (e.g. the customs progress in adhering to the Kyoto
Convention’s trade facilitation agenda, the progress of reducing documents for exports etc.). While it is
understandable that the nature of many IT projects is very challenging for long-term development and
sustainability, the government considered the evidence of outcomes accomplished should be rated
satisfactory.

For one of the project objectives (under component 3 “PPI and Investment? is to introduce transparency
in investment process), the government assessment credited the Investment Tracking System (ITS) being
introduced, up and running; and noted that the piloting for 3 PPI projects had actually been considered,
but was not carried out due to high associated costs. The Bank view was that the ITS wa sonly
implemented in one of the seven departments that are critical to the functioning of the system. Similarly,
the pilots of PPI projects were not advanced, thus mitigating the developmental result of that component
of the project. In the case of Legal Transparency (component 4), while the government assessment rated
the progress of websites of the Ministry of Justice and the Supreme Court as up and running, the Bank
view is that the contents of the sites fall short of expectation and that the Trade Information Website
remains incomplete.

(b) Co-Financiers/Donors



There was no co-financier15 on this project, but there were a number of development partners working on
activities complimentary to the success of Customs reforms and its automation system. These included
the risk management strategy (AusAID and JICA) and the Customs technical assistance advisors (IMF)
and the early support of reviewing imports and exports documents (EU). All of the complementary
activities were complementary to the GDCE Strategic Reform and Modernization Work Program. Donors
appreciated the customs automation works led by the World Bank and assistance provided to GDCE to
realize its objectives, but suggested that there was still room to improve the quality of the ASYCUDA
World system and its data recording. Overall, Donors were complimentary on what has been put in place,
as the Bank has built a culture of proper documentation and rules compliance. Donors also commended
the Bank for proactively working with the government and putting in place a system that simplifies
procedures and facilitates trade in Cambodia (risk-based judgment function, for instance, replaced the
concept of physical inspection). Donors suggested that the remaining functions of ASYCUDA may need
to be pursued, including the Direct Trader Input function.



(c) Other partners and stakeholders

The ICR mission team met and discussed the project with the Secretary General of the Garment
Manufacturers Association of Cambodia (GMAC), the largest employing industry sector in Cambodia,
who also partly benefited from the project. GMAC reiterated the usefulness of having the customs
automation system in place, serving primary needs of the private sector as it facilitates import and export
processes and eliminates unnecessary signatures/stamps. In addition, the GMAC appreciated the support
of BFC in monitoring working and labor conditions in the garment industry, enhancing Cambodia’s
brand name, and facilitating access to the US and EU markets.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

A. Definition and Current Status

Component 1:
   Installation and start-up of Customs Automation System ASYCUDA World:
     Geographic roll-out is almost complete: of the 21 government self-planned stations, 20 are up and
        running. One station at a dry port was closed down due to losing a legal battle between their
        business partners, unrelated to the project, but the coverage of the system remains close to 100
        percent of all customs declaration processes (well above the PDO target).
     Functional expansion: Export and Bonded Warehouse functions are operational at Phnom Penh
        International Airport customs site. Transit and manifest functions are still under development and
        testing.
     Direct Trader Input system – to which traders attach high importance - is being pursued and
        developed by the GDCE,C as there are some additional technical supports that the customs would
        need from the original software owner (the UNCTAD). GDCE is seeking their support.
   Certificate of Origin Automation (added in 2009): A wide effort has been made to rationalize and
    simplify procedures for would-be exporters to document the local content in their products. Plans
    have been drawn up to automate the processing of certificates of origin, but implementation has been
    delayed because all bids in a recent tender were rejected as unresponsive and non-compliant. It is
    being re-tendered after the project closure and being funded by another World Bank program (Trade
    Development Support Program).


Component 2:
   Export Market Access Fund (EMAF): EMAF has been operational for about three years, in two
    phases. Phase 1 ran for two years, with MOC staff making allocation decisions on the advice of a
    private consulting firm. To speed up decision-making and disbursement under Phase 2, the consulting
    firm evaluated and approved individual beneficiary proposals, within guidelines and objectives set by
    MOC. Requests were processed far faster under Phase 2 and achieved better outcomes due to lesson
    learned from Phase 1. The final EMAF report pointed to the greater efficiency of having a longer
    timescale to implement the program, to allow EMAF work with less developed companies whose first
    time exports are their major strategic decisions.
   Better Factories Cambodia: BFC has been operational for 5.5 years. Factories seeking an export
    certification of origin are required by MOC to allow expert monitors, trained under the ILO Better
    Factories Cambodia program, to conduct random evaluation visits to their plants, to assess working
    and labor conditions, including fair wages and employee health and safety. The program has been
    regarded as a major contributor to the great success of Cambodia’s garment industry, in maintaining
    and accessing wider and deeper access to the leading retail chains in USA and European markets.


Component 3:
   Private Participation in Infrastructure: Legal documentation (implementing rules and regulation)
    has been prepared for the adopted Concessions Law, and relevant officials were trained and are
    expected to manage future PPI project. But no pilot transaction of private participation in
    infrastructure (PPI) was launched by the project closing date, and there appears to be no concrete plan
    to pursue this initiative.

   Investor Tracking System: The Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC)’s Cambodia
    Investment Board (CIB) – the Government’s main agency for promoting private investment and
    approving FDI application in Cambodia - is putting in place a computerized Investor Tracking
    System that interacts with the various government offices within the CDC, to allow wider and more
    reliable access to relevant information about them. Hardware was installed in 2010 and a local
    consulting firm helped in setting up the database, assembling information from various government
    sources. Prospective users have been trained, and the system was launched at one key department
    (Project Evaluation and Incentives Department), but the rolling out to 6 other CDC departments had
    not materialized by the project closing date (July 31, 2012).


Component 4:
   Ministry of Justice website (http://www.moj.gov.kh/) is operational but so far offers only limited
    content of information, falling short of expectations.
   Supreme Court website (http://www.supremecourt.gov.kh/) is operational but so far it displays only
    a selection of civil and criminal judgment of the Court made up to 1997; more recent decisions are
    being reviewed by a group of legal experts to determine what is appropriate to make public. Despite
    the encouraging progress made, the volume of information remained short of targeted PDO.
   Ministry of Commerce’s Trade Information Website (added in 2009): This is conceived as a trade
    portal (Single Window for information) under the Ministry of Commerce website. Relevant
    documents and a prospective system have been designed, but its installation was delayed when all
    bids were rejected as unresponsive and non-compliant. It is being re-tendered after the project closing
    date, and will be funded under a separate World Bank’s managed Trade Development Support
    Program.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
The World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index (LPI) shows a modest improvement on customs
performance with scores increased from 2.19 in 2007 to 2.30 in 2012. The gains in clearance time
compare favorably with good practice elsewhere. The rate of physical inspection is close to the
international ‘good practice’ norm of below 15%. An increase in Customs revenue was also discerned
over this project period.

With respect to the Better Factories Cambodia project, the trajectory of the program toward full 
sustainability (from dependence on the assistance of development partners) is well illustrated in the 
following table. By 2011, the Better Factories program was mostly supported by buyer’s subscriptions 
and industry groups rather than the contributions of development partners, thus indicating that 
sustainability of the program can be achieved over the medium?term.

Annex 7. Summary of Grantee's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Even before the Bank started preparing its Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR), the
Cambodian Ministry of Commerce, the lead implementing agency, had compiled its own ICR in semi-
finished form, so that it was available as a central reference work for the benefit of the Bank’s ICR
mission. For this purpose the Ministry hired an international consultant (an individual) to write the
report, but the text he drafted drew on conversations with and contributions from, a large number of key
managers and stakeholders of the several government agencies involved in the project’s implementation.
The resulting report is exceptionally thorough and detailed in its content, running to 90 pages. It is also
very thoughtful in its assessment of the extent to which the project objective was achieved, and in its
evaluation of performance by the agencies implementing the various components. This annex can
summarize only the main features and conclusions, and acknowledge the strong sense of ownership and
commitment to the project objective that runs through it, reflecting with credit on the National Project
Team that has overseen the project’s design and implementation.

The Government’s ICR reviews the process by which the project design and objectives were developed,
the restructuring that proved necessary after three years of implementation, the results achieved and the
lessons learned. The main starting point was the Government’s 12-Point Action Plan adopted in 2004 and
pursued since then, and the setting up of a Special Inter-Ministerial Task Force to bring together the
government ministries and other agencies involved in varying ways with the promotion of investment and
the facilitation of trade, and to ensure coordination among donors. The project, funded by the IDA grant,
was an instrument to help the government carry out this Plan of Actions.

The report documents the process followed when the Government and the Bank concluded that the
creation of a national single window, one of the main instruments foreseen for attracting investment and
facilitating trade, was premature, and that instead the key agencies would develop their own ‘windows’
(in the sense of websites bringing together all information relevant to the agency’s mandate) within a
common framework of sub-objectives and markets for that information. Thus computerization of customs
processing of import and export clearances became the project’s core activity. The reallocation of the IDA
grant that accompanied the restructuring of the project gave primary attention to trade rather than to
investment.

The Government’s ICR is structured in a similar way to that of the Bank’s. The Report concludes with
annexes similar to those of a Bank ICR, including a tabulation of all procurement transactions, a review
of the status of compliance with the grant agreement, and an economic analysis of the project’s impact.
Economic Analysis includes a review of findings by the IFC’s Doing Business for each year from 2008 to
2012 and the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index for 2012, as well as other third-party analyses of
the Cambodian economy in general, and trade in particular, over the period of the Project. It ends with a
tabulation of trade facilitation issues identified by the private sector, and a matrix reviewing achievements
between 2004 and 2012 in implementing the Government’s 12-Point Action Plan.
