                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1 - The mission has observed continued progress by the General Department of Customs and Excise (GDCE) to strengthen the existing ASYCUDA system and the geographic
                         expansion to other customs sites. A number of gaps identified in the previous mission (December 2010) have been narrowed or removed. Notable progress was achieved as a result
                         of efforts made by GDCE and accelerated by the successful contract with the IT consulting firm (Webb Fountain) as well as the IT quality assurance adviser. ASYCUDA now operates

                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                          Report No: ISR6137



                         in 11 customs sites and expansion to 21 offices is underway. While things are progressing well, the mission urged the government to reinforce the expansion of ASYCUDA to other
                         offices to reach the 80% of customs declarations transactions target by the end of the project (presently ASYCUDA covers 50% of customs declarations transactions).

                         2 - a). The EMAF contract was extended (EMAF2). EMAF2 Contract was signed in July 13, 2011 for a period of 11 months (it is expected to run until June 1, 2012). EMAF2 contains

                         a number of substantial changes in the operation and administration of the scheme as agreed by the Ministry of Commerce and the World Bank. The changes were designed to fast
                         track the assessment and approval process. By the end of December 2011, the EMAF2 changes have made good progress and the overall implementation trend shows a higher rate
                         of disbursement than previously. b). With respect to the Better Factories Cambodia (BFC) program, while the signing of a new MOU in July 29, 2011 between the RGC, GMAC and
                         ILO offering continued support of the BFC program until the end of 2013 is encouraging, progress toward transitioning to a sustainable institutional model has been continuously
                         delayed, raising concern of future sustainability of Better Factories Cambodia (BFC) after 2013. The mission shares the Royal Government's concerns about risks involved with the
                         transition process, and the need for BFC to retain its full credibility in the industry. It is encouraged to learn that non-donor funding for BFC operations increased from 36% in 2010 to
                         54% in 2011 (a key indicator of the project PDO).

                         3 - Limited progress observed in implementing the Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI) component. While training sessions on the Law on Concessions were conducted during
                         2009 and 2010 for central and provincial government staff, the sub-decree to implement the Law has not progressed and no pilot transaction is under consideration. This part of the
                         project development objective is unlikely to be met (Project Objective suggests a 3 PPI-contract being piloted under the Law on Concessions). On the Investor Tracking System
                         activity, the mission was encouraged by the progress toward partial launching of the System at the CDC (currently applied at the Project Evaluation and Incentives Department), with
                         full deployment being expected by March/April 2012. The mission encouraged a speedier and full roll-out of the ITS to other 6 departments at the CDC (the IT contractor is fixing a
                         few small customized-points to fit CDC demand).

                         4 - Finally, progress on legal transparency, the project's fourth component, has been limited. While the websites of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) and of the Supreme Court (SC) are
                         up and running for more than a year now, and successful training sessions have been conducted, the volume and usefulness of information available on those websites fall short of
                         expectations. While the site content of Ministry of Justice remains very limited, the Supreme Court site took a much more significant step to improve, update, and link to other
                         government ministries, the Bar Association and other public institutions. Civil and criminal judgment cases have been posted but it would need further update to reflect the latest
                         judgments. A number of laws and regulations have been posted on both websites but the mission encouraged both agencies to keep updating to reflect the latest available and
                         relevant rules and regulations. Another activity, the mobilization of the ICT adviser to support the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) in (i) the automation of the application processes for
                         Certificates of Origins (CO) and (ii) creating a Trade Information Website (TIW), has been delayed. The procurement process has been done (handled by IPA) for most of 2011 but
                         received non-compliant/non-responsive bidders, and re-bidding plan is underway. Given that there is not sufficient time to rebid and implement these packages under TFCP, we
                         would propose they be rebid under the Trade Development Support Program (TDSP).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The mission team agrees with the RGC that a two-month extension from June 1, 2012 to July 31, 2012 is warranted. The assessment made by the General Department of Customs
                         and Excise (GDCE) was an important factor in making this decision. An extended closing date, according to GDCE, would allow them to finalize crucial aspects of the customs
                         automation system (hereafter referred to as ASYCUDA) and allow it to meet its development objectives. In making this decision, the mission team noted that implementation of the
                         ASYCUDA contract is proceeding satisfactorily and a short extension of the project will allow for its complete geographic and functional roll-out as well as completion of capacity
                         building efforts.
