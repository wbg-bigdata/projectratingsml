Project
Objectives:         The main objectives of the proposed Project are: (a) to demonstrate the feasibility
and value of using low temperature geothermal water as a renewable indigenous
energy resource for use in district heating systems; (b) to reduce emission of
greenhouse gases (GHG) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) by replacing gas and heavy
fuel oil (HFO) with a sulfur content of 3.5%; and (c) to promote sustainable
management and the development of environmentally sound and non-polluting
geothermal resources. The Project would contribute to energy security
highlighted as a priority in the National Energy Strategy, and it would
demonstrate the feasibility of developing the indigenous Lithuanian geothermal
resources.



Project
Description:        The Project would consist of two components to optimize use of the available
geothermal energy resources in Klaipeda: (a) Technical Assistance and Training
Component provided under a Danish Grant; and (b) an Investment Component for
implementation of the Klaipeda Geothermal Demonstration Plant, financed partly
by grants from the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and EU-Phare, and a
loan from the Bank. The TA component would include: design of the necessary
equipment for extraction and transfer of geothermal energy to the district heating
system; preparation of a detailed drilling program; management support to
Enterprise Geoterma; training of local personnel; and supervision of Project
implementation. The Demonstration Plant component would include investments
in production and injection wells, above ground facilities, and piping for the
entire extraction and the connection to the district heating system.
Project Benefits:   The benefits of the Project would include: (a) considerable local and global
enviromnental benefits through the reduction of CO2, SO2, total particulate matter
(TPM), and NO, emissions; (b) demonstrations of whether indigenous geothermal
resources can be cost effectively developed on a larger scale (as recommended
in the Lithuanian Energy Development Program); and (c) savings in foreign
exchange used to import fossil fuel for heating purposes.
Environment
Aspects:            The proposed Project would have only positive environmental impacts as no
emissions would be generated by the Project, and it would also significantly
reduce the use of fossil fuels in affected areas. It is anticipated that the
geothennal energy from the Project would reduce both oil and gas consumption.
The Project would result in annual reductions in emissions of CO2 and NO, by
47,800 tons and 1 ton respectively if natural gas is replaced, and 51,940 and 110
tons respectively if HFO is replaced. In addition the replacement of HFO would
result in an additional reduction of SO2 of about 1,160 tons per year. The
proposed Project has been placed in enviromnental screening category "B". An
environmental review consistent with the provisions of the World Bank's
Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental Assessment" and the applicable
enviromnental procedures of the GOL was carried out.
Project Risks:      The Project would demonstrate utilization of low temperature geothermal water
as an efficient energy resource for district heating through the use of established
heat pump technology successfully used in several European countries (Denmark,
Germany, and Sweden). The main risks underscoring the demonstration
character of the Project include: (a) Technical Risks: lower than expected supply
of geothermal energy (amount of water and water temperature);  (b)
Implementation Risks: a longer implementation period due to limited
implementation capacity; a limited administrative capacity in Lithuania for future
development of the geothermal resources; and a delayed installation of a steam
boiler at Klaipeda District Heating Entrerprise to provide the driving energy to
the geothermal plant (absorption heat pumps). These risks would be reduced by:
(a) careful monitoring during drilling of production wells; (b) ensuring that



-iii-
appropriate project management arrangements are in place in a timely manner;
(c) preparing and executing a sound Action Plan for development of the
Enterprise Geoterma (EG); and (d) securing grant funding to cover the
manufacturing and installation of required steam or hot water boiler. The Swiss
Government has declared its willingness to provide this grant.
Furthernore, there is an Economic Risk that the price of available HFO or
natural gas would fall to the point where its use would be competitive with
geothermal resources. Given the global outlook for fuel prices this is unlikely.
Moreover it is anticipated that the Lithuanian Ministry of Environmental
Protection will penalize the use of the available HFO of relatively high sulfur
content. In this event, the economics of the Project will become even more
attractive.
The proposed demonstration project is experimental, and meets GEF investment
criteria. The ERR for a subsequent plant is dependent on actual investment costs
based on Lithuanian engineering and construction, aquifer temperatures, return
network temperatures, and future fuel prices, among other factors. Therefore,
a second plant may not be justified on economic grounds until experience has
been gained by implementation of the Demonstration Project. If the Government
would request financing for a second plant, the Bank would make an independent
assessment of that plant's economic and financial viability based on the
information gathered at the time of the financing request. The Government has
been apprised of these issues and agrees to proceed with the investment in the
Demonstration Plant based on the full understanding of the risks.

I. BACKGROUND
A. Country Context
1.1.        Lithuania is the southernmost Baltic country. It covers an area of 65,200 km2, with a
population of about 3.8 million. During the Soviet period, Lithuania had a strong economy, based on
specialized industries and agriculture, which was fully integrated into the larger Soviet system. Since the
restoration of Lithuanian independence in 1991, the country has undertaken a major program of political
and economic reforms, which has brought it from a centrally planned economy to a transitional market
economy. In this process, it has experienced adjustment shocks common to many economies in transition,
characterized by a significant decline in economic productivity and high inflation rates. The gross
domestic product (GDP) also declined sharply as a result of the collapse of trading relations with Russia
and other former Soviet Republics.
1.2.        The Government of Lithuania (GOL) has been pursuing economnic reform  and
stabilization, including price and trade liberalization. A formal macro-economic program was launched
in 1991, supported by two IMF standby arrangements (in October 1991 and October 1993), and more
;ecently an EFF program (ongoing). Since then, Lithuania has been successful in containing monetary
expansion and fiscal deficits. Lithuania introduced the national currency, the Litas (in July 1993), which
has been tied to the US Dollar since April 1994 (4 Litas (LT) = US $1). Inflation has been reduced from
an annual rate of 1,020% in 1992 to about 30% in 1995, and is projected to decline further thereafter.
The introduction of a currency board system in April 1994 has been effective in ensuring continued
macroeconomic stability. The estimated per capita income level was US $1,350 in 1994. The Bank
expects the Lithuanian economy to continue to recover. GDP growth rate was 3% in 1995, and is
expected tp stabilize around 5 % in the medium to long term.
1.3.        The Bank's overall strategy in Lithuania is to support the country's efforts to accelerate
structural reforms leading to a full transition to a market-based economy and, at the same time, to support
efficient investments in high priority sectors to facilitate a return to economic growth. To date the Bank
has provided the GOL with a Rehabilitation Loan (No. 3737-LT) of US $60 million in October 1992
(which closed on December 31, 1995), a Power Rehabilitation Loan (No. 3524-LT) of US $26.4 million
in January 1995, the Klaipeda Environment Loan (No. 6401-LT) of US $7 million, the Enterprise and
Financial Sector Assistance Loan (No. 3866-LT) of US $25 million in April 1995, the Siauliai
Environment Loan (No. 3963-LT) of US $6.2 million in December 1995, and the Private Agriculture
Development Loan (No. 3996-LT) of US $30 million in April 1996.
1.4.         The Public Expenditure Review completed in 1994, jointly prepared by the GOL and
the Bank, highlights the need to support priority investments in energy, transport and environmental
services. The proposed Project is regarded as a priority by the GOL, in line with the National Energy
Strategy, which supports the development of indigenous and renewable energy sources.
B. Sectoral Context
Energy Sector
1.5.        Overview. Lithuania's economy is challenged by six major problems in the energy
sector: (a) high energy intensity and the need for energy efficiency and conservation; (b) limited



2                                                                                 Chapter I
domestic energy resources, which currently supply only 2% of total energy demand; (c) almost total
dependence on imported fuels from Russia and thus a vulnerability to serious supply disruptions; (d)
declining exports owing to economic contraction and disruption of trade in the region; (e) rapid energy
price escalation and difficulty in passing. price increases through to final consumers; and (f) issues related
to the environment and to the safety of the Ignalina nuclear power plant. Faced with these challenges,
the Government of Lithuania (GOL) announced a National Energy Strategy in late 1992 based on cost
recovery, energy conservation, and the development of indigenous resources.
1.6.         Energv Consumption. Lithuania's economy is highly energy-intensive: at 1.5 kg of oil
equivalent per US $1 of GDP in 1990, it is several times higher than in other industrialized economies.
This is due to unrealistic energy pricing, inefficient methods of energy production and use, high system
losses, obsolete equipment, and inadequate maintenance of facilities.
1.7.         Lithuania's primary energy consumption dropped by 51 % between 1991 and 1993 (from
15 to 7.2 Mtoe), largely as a result of economic contraction, which in itself was influenced by steep
increases in the price of energy. In the same period, the energy mix changed substantially. The share
of natural gas declined from 27% of primary energy consumption in 1991 to less than 17% in 1993.
Nuclear power increased its share from 23% to 33%. The share of oil products in the primary energy
supply initially fell from 44% to 37% between 1991 and 1992, but rose to 42% in 1993 because of a glut
of heavv fuel oil (HFO) in the market, making it especially attractive to purchase, especially given the
higher cost of natural gas.
1.8.         Domestic Energy Resources. Despite substantial excess capacity in oil refining and
electricity generation, Lithuania has very limited primary energy resources. There is some potential to
develop local resources further, particularly onshore and offshore petroleum (about 50 and 100 million
tons respectively), natural gas, and geothermal fields. The country also has some peat deposits, and
renewable resources such as forest waste, which couid play a role in the fuel mix. The advantage of
exploiting geothermal resources when geothermal water is re-injected into the aquifer, is that there are
no adverse environmental impacts from utilizing this resource, compared to those of other national
resources.
1.9.         Institutional Setting. The Lithuanian energy sector remains largely state-owned with
control exercised principally by the Ministry of Energy. The main operating organizations are the
Lithuanian Power Company (LPC), Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant, Lithuania Gas, Lithuanian Fuel,
Mazeikiai Oil Refinery, Klaipeda Oil Export Company, the regional gas distribution companies, and a
number of research and construction companies. With a few exceptions, enterprises are designated as
Special Purpose State-owned Enterprises, thereby giving the Government greater power to intervene in
the management of state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
1.10.        LPC is the cornerstone of the electricity subsector, controlling electricity generation, the
transmission grid, inter-company trade and external contracts. LPC determines the amount of electricity
to be produced by its generating plants, contracts for fuel allocations, and pays its generators for
electricity based on production costs. All of Lithuania's district heating (DH) companies are also under
LPC control. LPC has a large number of heat-only boilers providing heat under its district heating
affiliates. Combined heat and power stations also provide heat to the district heating networks, although
the recent drop in electricity demand has made this source of heat less economic than running heat-only
boilers and supplying electricity from the nuclear power plant at Ignalina.



Background                                                                               3
1.11.        Enterprise Geoterma (EG), which will be responsible for the implementation of the
Project, was earlier a branch of LPC and responsible for the development of the Lithuanian geothermal
resources. By Government decree no. 1609 December 22, 1995, EG was corporatized and established
as an independent closed joint stock company, with the Government as the majority shareholder. EG
became registered as a legal entity March 1, 1996 at Vilnius City Council; registration no. AB96-269.
1.12.        Lithuania is in the process of establishing regulatory bodies concurrently with
commercialization of the energy sector. An interim body, the Energy Pricing Council, has been
established to submit pricing proposals to the Cabinet. An Energy Agency has been created to help
collect data and draft policy for the Government.
1.13.        District heating systems supply a major part of residential areas and industries with heat.
Residential areas (26 million mi2 of housing) obtain hot water at a maximum temperature of 150° C, and
many industries are supplied with steam. The annual heat production delivered to the district heating
systems is approximately 100 PJ, of which about 25 PJ are produced as steam for industry. The
residential heat consumption of 2.4 CJ/m2 is more than double that of Western Europe, as a result of
poorly insulated buildings and the poor condition of the district heating systems. In 1993, the total fuel
consumed in district heating systems had fallen to 0.74 bcm of gas and 0.9 million tons of heavy fuel oil
(HFO)--a drop of 0.3 bcm and 0.3 million tons respectively from 1991. This decrease reflects
significantly lower industrial consumption, and constrained supply to residential consumers. The share
of DH in final energy consumption actually rose from 22% to 24% between 1991 and 1993, however,
due to a drastic decline in electricity production. The vast majority of this heat was produced in heat-only
boilers.
1.14.        District Heating. The principal problems in the district heating systems are: (a) heat
production plants rely on heat-only boilers (HOB), fueled by natural gas or HFO, to provide 70% of
annual heat production, which is substantially less efficient than using heat from combined heat and power
plants; (b) the systems are run in "constant-flow operaiion mode", making load dispatching and consurrer
heat regulation (and therefore metering) impossible, and leading to excessively high power consumption
of water pumps; and (c) the pipe systems suffer from a monthly loss of 100-400% of total network water
volume, whereas a 5-15% monthly loss is the norm in modern, pre-insulated pipe systems. Based on a
200% monthly water loss, heat loss from a network can be estimated as 8 GJ/year/rn3 of network
volume. In general, measures such as modification of network connections would enable a reduced
network temperature, resulting in significant energy savings, and it has been agreed with the MOE (in
March 1995) that such network modifications are a priority in Klaipeda. However, the above-mentioned
problems would not be addressed under the Project, as it is focusing on a much more narrow aspect
concerning fossil fuel substitution.
1.15.        The GOL has been subsidizing district heating consumption through a combination of
cross subsidies from electricity and direct operating subsidies. Residential consumers are also partially
compensated for that part of their heat bill which exceeds 15% of the household income. This direct
subsidy, through LPC, is capped at an estimated average consumption level based on the cost to heat 15
square meters per resident and an extra 15 square meters per dwelling. In addition, the GOL announced
in late 1993 that it would enforce payment of the heating bills by linking it to electricity supply. There
are still several inherent problems with this system of subsidization: there is no guarantee that cross
subsidies will meet expected targets, and the consumer compensation scheme is designed for a ce tain
level of heat use which may not be possible to provide in all areas. Giveln the different subsidies, the
system is administratively complex, and is subsidized even at full tariff level before compensation is

provided.
New.         The in paragraph 1.14-1.15 above mentioned problems will not be addressed under tis
Project, as it will focus on the much more narrow issue of replacing imported fuels by use of indigenous
and renewable geothermal energy resources.
Environmental Sector
1.16.        Background. Environmental problems in Lithuania are moderate in number and severity.
Most pollution problems, particularly air pollution, are concentrated in urban areas and in industrial and
energy facilities throughout the country. Municipal and industrial discharges and agricultural runoff into
the north Baltic coast, Nemunas river, and Kursiu lagoon have caused serious pollution in these
waterbodies. Agricultural runoff contributes 40-50% of the nutrient load.
1.17.        Lithuanian energy production and consumption, together with industrial plants, have
historically been responsible for the majority of air pollution in the country. Lithuanian health authorities
report health effects associated with air pollution (particulates, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides),
principally heart and respiratory diseases. In urban areas and towns, locally significant air quality
problems occur during the winter heating season as a result of heavy fuel oil used in low-efficiency
boilers used for district heating and building heating. Aggregate air quality data suggest that problems
are especially high in Kaunas, Klaipeda, Siauliai, and Vilnius. While levels of air pollution in general
have declined during the last 2-3 years, due to decrease in economic activity, they should be expected
to increase in the medium-to-longer term perspective as the economic recovery occurs, unless energy
conservation measures are adopted, use of fuel is switched to less polluting fuels, and actions are taken
to control pollution.
1.18.        A major concern is the safety of the nuclear power plant, Ignalina, which supplies 90%
of electricity requirements, but does not comply with international standards. The international
community and the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized countries have requested that the nuclear plants
of Soviet design that lack the required safety provisions be retired as soon as possible, taking into account
vnergy demand in the country and alternative sources of power supply. The Ignalina nuclear power plant
is scheduled to be closed by 2008 at the latest.
1.19.        Country Environment Policy and Strategy. Environmental policy is characterized by a
combination of administrative procedures, legislation, and standards that were in use when Lithuania was
part of the Soviet Union and some new laws and provisions stipulated by the GOL. National objectives
are to: (a) create a legal system which would support more effective enforcement of environmental laws
and regulations; (b) establish a system of environmental standards reflecting European norms; (c) develop
an effective monitoring system; (d) improve the system of market based incentives; and (e) join basic
international agreements and conventions.
1.20.        Currently, there are eight laws directly related to environmental protection. The General
Environmental Protection Law, passed in 1992, is the core of the system and is complemented by a
Lithuanian environmental assessment procedure. Nine other complementary laws are under preparation
and review. The most important of these are the Law on Environmental Impact Assessment and the Law
on Waste Management. Lithuania is a party to a number of international environmental conventions and



Background                                                                            5
treaties. It is also active in the Enviromnental Action Program for Central and Eastern Europe and the
environrental working groups of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE).
1.21.        A national environmental strategy has been prepared by MOEP, over the past year, by
a joint Lithuanian and Irish consultant team with financing from the EU-PHARE program. It outlines
a program of short- and long-term actions. An important part of this strategy would be the identification
of actions to reduce the generation of pollution at source. This study will be completed by September
1995. As mentioned in para.
1.7, there is a trend toward
replacing natural gas with HFO,            Table 1.1: Emilouz from Burning Fuel

for natural gas than for HFO.                                          (kg/G)

Geothermal Sector
1.22.        Background. Geothermal water constitutes an enormous potential reserve of energy,
which varies in temperature depending on the geological formation and depth. In the Baltic region,
access to geothermal water is quite easy, as the drilling depth can be limited to about 800-1200 m in the
Devon stratum, where the temperatures are between 25-50°C. Temperatures between 75-85°C can be
found at a depth of about 2000 m (in the Cambrium stratum), but the availability of sufficient amounts
of water is questionable; that stratum is not recommended for extensive use until further data can be
developed.
1.23.        The resource for the proposed Project is situated in a series of Lower Devonian aquifer
sands underlying the district of Klaipeda, at a depth of about 1,200 meters. These sands are extensive
and their properties (thickness, porosity, permeability, sand consolidation, etc.) in the Klaipeda area
(based on well tests, core samples and other data) appear to be good to excellent. Being of a sedimentary
origin, the properties of the aquifer sands are predictable and may be extrapolated over a large area, thus
the heat reserves can be determined with a good degree of confidence.
1.24.        During 1989-1993 a Danish consultant group financed by the Danish EPA carried out a
comprehensive study (Baldc Geothermal Energy Study) to detennine the size and quality of geothermal
resources in Latvia and Lithuania and to assess the potential for utilizing geothermal energy to replace
currently used fossil fuel for heat generation. With the temperature of the water resources being between
30-950C, the energy could only be utilized economically for heating requiring access to a district heating
system.
1.25.        The study confirmed that substandal geothermal aquifers occur within the Devonian and
Cambrian strata, and it identified a number of cities, where the use of geothermal energy could substitute
for fossil fuel for up to 30% of energy consumption, dependent on the actual aquifer temperature. The



6                                                                              Chapter I
study also deternined that the largest and most promising storage areas are located in Lithuania.
1.26.        The findings of the study underscores the existence of a significant indigenous resource
and are briefly described as follows:
*   The technical supply of geothermal energy within the Lithuanian border is about 345 Exajoules
(345x10'8 J) or 96x109 MWh. The economical heat resource is 230 Exajoules or 64x109 MWh.
Of this amount, about 69% is located in the Devon stratum. In terms of fossil fuel, this would
correspond to 6.8 billion tons of oil equivalent (TOE) or an economic asset value of
approximately US $640 billion based on the current fuel price of US $95 per ton.
*   The geothermal area in Klaipeda covers 144 square km. The actual geothermal aquifer is at a
depth interval of 1,010-1,348 meters, with a permeability of 1,300 mD, and a temperature of 420
C. Klaipeda was found to have superior aquifer conditions, and sufficient geothermal
temperature conditions to allow for a demonstration of the extraction of geothermal energy. The
estimated supply of economical geothermal energy resource accessible for Klaipeda is 0.5
Exajoules or 139x106 MWh, with an estimated economic value of US $1.4 billion.
*   The annual heat demand in Klaipeda based on the existing district heating system is 5,600
Terajoules (5,600x1012 J) or 1.56x10° MWh. The proposed Project is based on meeting about
10% of the current heat demand for Klaipeda, 530 Terajoules or 1.43xl05 MWh, with an
estimated economic value of US $1.5 million per year.
1.27.        Lithuania's low temperature geothermal resources would be utilized mainly to complement
centralized district heating systems by substituting part of the base load supply presently provided by
fossil fuels. It is estimated, on a conservative basis, that about 10% of this heat supply in about seven
cities could be substituted by geothermal energy. Based on a total production of 51,014 TJ of hot water
from centralized heat-only boilers in 1994, geothermal energy could conceivably replace 5,000 TJ (about
120,000 toe) of imported fossil fuels, or about 2% of total 1994 fossil fuel imports.
1.28.        Based on the study, on August 17, 1993, the GOL issued Decree 631, granting a permit
for imnplementation of the geothermal demonstration plant. This permit, valid for three years, was
granted to the Lithuania Power Company (LPC). LPC was simultaneously granted the exclusive right
to produce heat energy in the plant for 25 years, and to supply the energy to the Klaipeda district heating
network. In addition, the Enterprise Geoterna (EG), a branch of LPC, has a license permitting the
search for, and exploitation of, geothermal resources. This license, and right to produce energyfrom the
geothermal pkmat have by Decree 1609, issued on December 22, 1995, been transferred to EG.
Furthermore, the new EG's Articles of Association, registered on March 1, 1996, describes the
commercial-economic activities related to the Lithuanian geothermal resources.
1.29.        Impact on Energv Imports. Lithuania's low temperature geothermal resources would be
utilized mainly to complement centralized district heating systems by substituting part of the base load
supply presently provided by fossil fuels. It is estimated that about 10% of this heat supply in about
seven cities could be substituted by geothermal energy. Based on a total production of 51,014 TJ of hot
water from centralized heat-only boilers in 1994, geothermal energy could conceivably replace 5,000 TJ
(about 120,000 toe) of imported fossil fuels, about 10% of fuel imports for heat generation or about 2%
of total 1994 fossil fuel imports.



Background                                                                           7
C. Bank Strategy and Experience
1.30.        The recent Energy Sector Review prepared by the World Bank (May 1994) highlighted
the following needs: (a) to target limited investment resources to improve production efficiency; (b) to
set price incentives to promote conservation; and (c) to imnprove the security of fuel supplies. The
Review recognized the benefits of geothermal energy for application in district heating.
1.31.       The Bank's environmental strategy in Lithuania is to support implementation of a limited
number of priority environmental investments which have significant impact and are complemented by
support for institutional strengthening activities. The Bank strategy recognizes the need to support
preventive measures to avoid adverse environmental impacts, through the use of policy and regulatory
measures. The Bank also seeks to develop projects which can provide the basis for the effective
mobilization of resources from other international financial institutions, bilateral donors and
nongovernmental sources.
1.32.        Bank experience in geothermal energy projects in Central and Eastern Europe is limited
to ongoing preparation work in Poland and Slovakia. In Poland, a project in Zakopane (US $130 million)
has been identified, as well as two projects in Zyrardow outside Warsaw (US $60 million) and in
Szczecin (US $120 million). In Slovakia, a project in Kosice (US $120 million) has been identified. All
projects would use geothermal water at a temperature of 85 - 95°C (higher temperatures than would be
used in the Klaipeda Geothermal Demonstration Project), and the heat would be transferred using existing
district heating networks through the use of heat exchangers.
1.33.        The Bank's experience in implementing geothermal projects is currently limited in regard
to power producing plants such as Olkaria in Kenya (US $59.9 million) for generation up to 45 MW of
electricity, and the recently approved project in the Philippines (US $305 million) partly financed by
GEF, for generating up to 700 MW of steam to be produced at Leyte and transported to Cebu and Luzon.
1.34.        The involvement of the Bank and the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) in the
proposed Project would provide an opportunity to support Lithuanian efforts to reduce dependence on
imported fossil fuels for heating and improve national environmental quality through the reduction of
localized air pollution (particulates and SO2) and improve the global environment through the reduction
of greenhouse gases. In the absence of Bank and GEF involvement, it is unlikely that the country would
be able to mobilize the technical assistance and financial resources required to implemnent a demonstration
project of this nature.
1.34        This involvement has already resulted in establishing the implementing agency as a
separate legal entity under Lithuanian law, developing a business plan for the company's involvement in
the development of Lithuania's geothermal resources, and contractual arrangements for long-termn supply
of geothermal energy to a district heating company as well as eventual future private sector participation.

II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Origins and Formulation
2. 1         The GOL requested the Danish EPA to extend the Baltic Geothermal Energy Study (para.
1 24) to include the preparation of a feasibility study for the construction of a geothermal demonstration
plant in Klaipeda, which was identified as being the best location for a demonstration project. The city
of Klaipeda is situated on the Baltic Coast on the mouth of the Kursiu Lagoon. With its population of
204,000, Klaipeda is Lithuania's third largest city. The town has an existing district heating network with
a related annual heat demand (1994) of 5,600 Terajoules (TJ).
2.2          The study indicated that a suitable size of the demonstration plant could provide about
10% of the heat demand to the Klaipeda District Heating System. Energy could be extracted from the
geothermal water by using heat pump technology based on absorption heat pumps. The feasibility study
also determnined that by reducing the temperature regime in the district heating network, an additional
24 % of geothermal energy could be extracted without any additional investments in the geothermal plant.
The proposed geothermal plant would produce 530 TJ annually without reduction of the network
temperature. This energy amount corresponds to about 16,500 tons of oil or 19.5 million m3 of natural
gas.
2.3          Preparation of the proposed Project included an identification mission in February 1994,
a pre-appraisal mission in September 1994 and an appraisal mission in March 1995. In between, a
number of preparatory field visits were made to review specific issues in combination with other missions
to the Region. These missions and visits have also included the participation of representatives of the
Ministry of Environment of Denmark.
B. Project Radonale
2.4          The Energy Sector Review, as mentioned in para. 1.28,, highlights the needs of
improving energy production effficiency and promoting energy conservation. These needs include major
undertakings in changing and rehabilitating the networks for district heat distribution. Such measures
would result in a higher Economic Rate of Return, compared to the proposed Project. The Government,
however, is currently not ready to reform the sector, which is why the proposed Project provides an
opportunity to initiate this reform. The proposed Project would be the first geothermal project to supply
heat to a district heating system in the Baltic States. It is also the first geothermal project financed by
the Bank, where the geothermal energy is extracted from an aquifer with a temperature as low as 42-
50°C, and transferred to a district heating system by use of heat pump technology.
2.5          The Project is considered a national priority, and is in compliance with the National
Energy Strategy's stated aim of developing indigenous energy resources. It also limits the environmental
impacts, both localized air pollution (particulates and sulfur dioxide) and those with broader impacts, such
as the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) which are covered by international
agreements ratified by the GAL, the Montreal Protocol, and the Framework of Climate Changes
Convention. The Project would initially reduce the emission of greenhouse gases from the boiler houses
in Klaipeda by about 10%.
2.6          The feasibility study, supported by the Danish EPA (para. 2.1), shows that the



The Project                                                                                  9
geothermal energy, compared to other indigenous energy resources such as peat and wood chips, has a
much larger development potential, and a lower heat generation cost based on a production capacity of
530 TJ.'
2.7           There is also the potential for a larger impact if the technical and economic exploitation
of this resource is confirmed. Geothermal heat could be expanded to eighteen larger urban areas with
existing district heating networks. Of these, seven have been specifically included in the Danish study.
The collective annual heat demand of these seven urban areas amounts to approximately 50 Petajoules,
or 13.5x105 MWh. As the heating networks are technically compatible, the replicability prospects of the
proposed geothermal project are good. Continued development of the Lithuanian geothermal resource,
to cover up to 20% of the district heating demand, would carry an inherent annual reduction in the CO2
emissions related to heat production on the order of 750,000 tons. The corresponding reduction in the
SO2 emission amounts to 22,000 tons. The savings, if all eighteen systems were to use geothermal
energy, would be equivalent to about 300,000 tons of HFO, with a total annual value of US $29 million,
based on the current border price of US $95 per ton.
C. Rationale for GEF Involvement
2.8           The Project would provide a mechanism for the GEF to test the feasibility of low
temperature geothermal energy as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and reduce the
dependence on fossil fuels in district heating systems. With successful implementation, the Project could
serve as a paradigm for other FSU republics with extensive district heating systems and renewable
geothermal energy resources. The Project is eligible for GEF funding as it conforms to the Guidance for
Programming GEF Resources in 1995 as follows: (a) it is sustainable; (b) it is a national priority in the
National Energy Strategy; (c) it provides the means of abating GHG at a cost below US $25 per ton of
carbon; (d) it includes an essential transfer of technology; (e) it would develop an indigenous and
renewable energy source; and (f) it would demonstrate that a further extraction of geothermal energy is
achievable when combined with other energy conserving measures in the Klaipeda district heating system.
The high potential of reducing greenhouse gases led the GEF Council to approve a US $6.9 million grant
on May 5, 1995 for the incremental costs of making the demonstration plant financially viable.
D. Project Objectives
2.9           The Project has the following main objectives:
*    to demonstrate the feasibility and value of using low temperature geothermal water as a renewable
indigenous energy resource in district heating systems;
*   to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) and SO2 by replacing gas and heavy oil (mazut
with a S-content of 3.5%); and
It should also be mentioned that peat is not considered a renewable resource, and the limited amount available has
been allocated for the intrial and agricultural sectors. Feeding the boiler with wood chips would require a thinning of all
forested areas in Lithuania, which would be unrealistic. Wood chips should be used for smaller boilers in the vicinity of
forests.



10                                                                           Chapter II
*   to promote sustainable management and the development of environmentally sound and non-
polluting geothermal resources both in a national and. regional perspective.
E. Project Components and Description
2.10         Project  Description.  The  proposed  Project would  be  developed  as  an
environmental/energy management project in the city of Klaipeda. The Project has two complementary
components:
(a) Technical Assistance and Training Component for:
*     design of the geothermal loop including all necessary equipment for extracting the heat
from the geothermal water and transferring it to the district heating system;
*     preparation of detailed drilling, testing, and completion programs;
*     management support for project implementation, including support in preparing tender
documents, and construction supervision; and
*     training of Lithuanian staff and management in the operation of a similar geothermal
plant in Thisted, Denmark to optimize the transfer of technology.
(b) Investment Component for:
*     establishment of two production wells and one injection well;
*     above ground facilities including building and necessary equipment such as absorption
heat pumps, heat exchanger, and auxiliary equipment for control and regulation of the
plant and the heat transfer to the district heating system; and
*     piping between production wells and geothermal plant, and between the geothermal plant
to the injection well, and piping between the geothermal plant and the district heating
network.
Further details of the components are provided in Annex 1 and a summary of the elements of the
proposed Project is provided in Annex 1, Chart 1.
2.11         Technologv. The proposed geothermal project involves the circulation of 600 m3/h of
420C geothermal water from about 1,200 meters depth via a closed geothermal loop, utilizing a heat
exchanger and heat pumps for the retrieval and subsequent supply of heat into the existing district heating
network in Klaipeda. The geothermal water would be extracted from two production wells and returned
with reduced temperatures to the same depth to maintain formation pressure and to avoid creating water
pollution problems. The technology proposed for utilization of the available low temperature geothermal
heat in existing district heating networks is well developed and is being employed in several European
towns and cities. A more detailed description of the proposed geothermal plant is presented in Annex 2.



The Project                                                                           11
2.12         The region was intensively investigated and explored in search of gas and oil fields. The
geological and petrophysical information from more than 400 boreholes have been compiled and
evaluated, and the predicted findings are described in para 1.26. The geotechnical and geothermal
information linked to the actual locations of the demonstration plant indicate that up to 850 m1/h could
possibly be extracted from the two production wells and the temperature of the geothermal water could
be as high as 480C. An increase in temperature would give an additional 20 TJ/°C, and increased water
extractions would result in an additional 85 TJ/100m3/h. Furthermore, if the network temperature regime
were to be discarded as a result of expected network modifications, a larger amount of energy could be
extracted from the geothermal water.
2.13         Drilling will be undertaken using traditional drilling mud (water based bentonitic mud).
The risk of severe drilling fluid loss to the aquifer zone and drilling "blindly" is not anticipated. Such
problems are encountered in highly fractured geothermal zones associated with faults and volcanic
activity, and not in the zone under consideration. Due to its sedimentary origin and the total absence of
organic material, the aquifer water is unlikely to contain H2S, CO, or hydrocarbons.
2.14         There are technical risks, however, which justify starting first with a demonstration plant.
They are: (a) the sustainable level of geothermal water that can be extracted; and (b) the temperature of
the geothermal water. Even if the plant design is very conservative and robust, these risks would result
in a lower than expected amount of geothermal heat being extracted. To reduce the impact of these risks
;he feasibility study is based on an energy extraction which is about 30% less than anticipated maximum
lutput.
2.15         Implementation Schedule. Project implementation would be expected to begin January
1996 and would be carried out over a three-year period. During negotiations the Project implementation
schedules presented in Annex 1.5 were confirmed.
F. Cost Estimates
2.16         The total cost of the Project is estimated to be US $18.02 million or LT 72.08 million
equivalent, including contingencies, but excluding taxes. The estimated cost distributed among project
subcomponents is shown in Table 2.1 and in greater detail in Annex 1, Table 9(b).
2.17         The total base cost is estimated at US $15.09 million. Physical contingencies are
estimated at US $0.75 million. Price contingencies between January 1, 1995 and December 1998 would
amount to approximately US $1.78 million or 11.2% of base cost plus physical contingencies. Total
contingencies represent 16.8% of the base cost. The foreign exchange component is estimated at
approximately US $15.01 million including contingencies, or about 83% of the total project cost.
G. Project Financing Armngements
2.18         Financing Plan. The proposed IBRD loan of US $5.9 rnillion would finance about 32.7%
of total Project costs. The loan would be repaid by the GOL over 20 years including 5 years grace at
the Bank's standard variable rate of interest.

2.19            The Global Environment Facility, GEF, would cofinance the project with a grant of US
$6.9 million, equal to 38.1% of total Project cost. Parallel cofinancing on a grant basis by the
Government of Denmark (US $2.5 million equivalent) and the European Union (US $120,000 equivalent)
comprises about 14.5% of total project costs. The local counterpart contribution of LT 10.4 million or
US $2.6 million equivalent would be provided by the GOL as a contribution to EG. A condition of
effectiveness of the Bank loan would be that Government contributions and the grants from GEF and from
Denmark have been declared effectve. The sunmarized financing plan presented in Table 2.2 includes
the proceeds of the Bank loan, the GOL contribution and cofinancing. Detailed financing plans are
presented in Annex 1.

2.20         Onlending Arrangements. The Govermment would onlend proceeds of the Bank loan for
EG, under terms similar to the Government's conditions with Bank; 20 years maturity including 5 years
grace and at the Bank's variable interest rate. EG should carry this foreign exchange risk. As a condition
of effectiveness of the Bank loan, a subsidiary loan agreement have to have been executed between the
Government and EG. The Government would furthermore channel the GEF grant to EG as a grant.
H. Procurement
2.21         Procurement under parallel cofinancing arrangements (US $2.62 million) would be carried
out through tied procurement in accordance with procurement regulations of the Government of Denmark,
and the EU-PHARE Program. All goods and works to be financed from the loan proceeds would be
procured in accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines (January 1995) including amendments
as of the loan signing date, using the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents. Procurement would be
undertaken in the following manner:
(a)    All contracts funded by the Bank and GEF which are estimated to cost more than
US $250,000 equivalent per contract would be procured following International
Competitve Bidding (ICB). The Borrower would use the Bank's Standard Bidding
Documents for Supply and Erect Contracts. Eight contracts totalling US $14.6 million
would be for: (a) drilling operations to establish production and injection wells; (b) well
completion; (c) building and civil works; (d) connection to boiler house and external
piping; (e) absorption heat pump; (f) heat exchangers; (g) filters, valves and internal
piping; and (h) control and regulation equipment, and would be awarded under ICB. Such
contracts would include all goods and civil works necessary for component
implementation.
(b)    Packages procured through ICB would account for 100% of the total value of the Bank
Loan and 92.1 % of the total value of the GEF grant. Invitations for bids would be
grouped in sizeable bid packages to enhance competition and benefit from economies of
scale in bid prices. The proposed packages for ICB procurement are described in greater
detail in Annex 1, Table 13 and Table 14.
(c)    One contract for consultant services, financed by the GEF, for control and evaluation of

drilling operations (US $0.16 million) would be procured through shortlisting and
competitive selection according to Bank Guidelines for Use of Consultants (August 1981).

2.22          Procurement training  was provided  by  the Bank's Procurement Specialist to
representatives of the MOE, LPC, KDHE, and EG. TENA (the procurement unit of LPC) would be
involved in the preparation of bidding documents and procurement arrangements, and already has
experience in the preparation of procurement documents in accordance to Bank standards. In addition,
to build up EG's procurement capacity, provision of international technical assistance for Project
implementation provided under the Danish grant should ensure adequate administration of procurement
(see Annex 1).
Z.23          Procurement Review. All ICB procurement packages for goods and civil works valued
at US $250,000 or more would be subject to the Bank's prior review and approval, in accordance with
paragraphs 2 and 3 of Appendix 1 of the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. All prior review items would
cover 100% of the total amount of the loan and the 92.1% of the GEF grant. The prior review threshold
for consultant services is US $100,000 for firms, and US $50,000 for individuals. Other loan-funded
activities would be subject to the Bank's post review during the supervision of the project, in accordance
with paragraphs 3 and 4 of Appendix 1 of the Guidelines.
2.24          All documents related to the GEF financed consulting services as well as the Terms of
Reference (TOR) for Technical Assistance provided under the grants from Denmark and EU-Phare will
require prior review by the Bank.
2.25          Procurement Monitoring. Procurement data would be collected and recorded for: (a)
prompt reporting of contract award information by the Borrower; (b) comprehensive quarterly reports
to the Bank by the Borrower; and (c) revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising,

I. Disbursements
2.26           The proposed Project is expected to be disbursed over a period of four (Bank) fiscal years
(1996-1999) with an estimated closing date on July 31, 1998. Disbursements per year are shown in Table
2.4. Table 2.5 shows the disbursement, per fiscal year, of all the financier's contributions for the
project. Descriptions of all the Bank loan and GEF grant proceeds and forecasts of expenditure and
disbursement for the proposed Project are shown in Annex 1, Table 16. The disbursement schedule is
shown in Annex 1, Table 17.

2.27           The pace of the disbursement deviates substantially compared to the chosen sector
schedules. The implementation of the Project is, however, limited to one investment component, where
the underground work has to be carried out in a very short period, whereafter all the necessary above-
ground installation can start. If implemented in a western country, the Project would easily be finished
within two years. Furthermore, the substantial Technical Assistance (granted by the Government of
Denmark) serves as a guarantee for timely implementation.
2.28           The proceeds of the Bank loan and the GEF grant would be disbursed against:
(a)    For goods: 100%  of foreign expenditures, 100%  of local ex-factory expenditures and
80% of local expenditures for other items procured locally;
(b)    For works: 100% of foreign expenditures and 80%  of local expenditures; and

(c)    100% of expenditures for consultancy services and training.
All cofinancers would manage their own disbursements.
2.29         Disbursement requests would be prepared and submitted to the Bank by EG. It is
expected that EG staff would attend disbursement training courses organized by the Bank.
2.30         Disbursement would be made against standard Bank documentation. The documentation
to support these expenditures would be retained by EG for review by Bank supervision missions and
verification by external audits. Disbursement requests would be fully documented except for expenditures
under contracts for goods and equipment valued at less than US $250,000 equivalent, where statements
of expenditure (SOE) would be used. The minimum size of the application for direct payment and
issuance of a special commitment is US $100,000 equivalent.
2.31         To facilitate Project implementation, the Borrower would establish a Special Account in
one of the major foreign commercial banks on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank to cover the
Bank's share of expenditures. The authorized allocation would be US $500,000, representing about four
months of average expenditures made through the Special Account. During the early stages of the
Project, the initial allocation to the Special Account would be limited to US $250,000. However, when
the aggregate disbursement under Loan has reached the level of US $2,000,000, the initial allocation may
be increased to the authorized allocation of US $500,000 by submitting the relevant application for
withdrawal. Applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted monthly or when
one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. Documentation requirements for
replenishment would follow the standard Bank procedure as described in the Disbursement Handbook,
Chapter 6. In addition, monthly bank statements of the Special Account which have been reconciled by
the Borrower would accompany all replenishment requests. During negotiations the terns and conditions
of the establishment and operation of the Special Account were set forth.
J. Environmental Aspects
2.32         Preparation of the proposed Project has included an environmental review consistent with
the applicable procedures of the GAL and the provisions of World Bank Operational Directive 4.01,
"Environmental Assessment" for a category "B" project. As the Project would not generate waste or any
emissions to either air or water, the review has been based on gathered information about environmental
benefits as a result of reduced consumption of fossil fuels. Implementation of the Project would result in
improvement of ambient air quality through annual reductions in emissions of CO2 and NO, to the amount
of 47,800 and 310 tons respectively if natural gas is replaced, and 51,940 and 265 tons respectively if
HFO is replaced. In addition, the replacement of HFO would result in an additional reduction of S02
of about 1160 tons per year. The reduction of S02 and NO, would result in an improvement of the
ambient air quality at the national level, while the reduction of CO2 is regarded as a global benefit,
thereby also making the project eligible for GEF funding. Annex 3 summarizes the findings of the
environmental review. Attached as Annex 4 is the Bank's Environmental Data Sheet.
2.33         EG has received all routine approvals for construction of the geothermal plant, including
the local electricity company and the water and sewage company. EG has also received a formal
environmental impact clearance from the Ministry of the Environment. The Ministry of Construction and
Urban Development, will issue the permission to start construction.






M. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Enterpise Geoterma
3.1          The implementing agency for the Project will be the closed joint stock company,
Enterprise Geoterma (EG). Its staff was previously employed by the Lithuanian Power Company (LPC),
within which it constituted a unit entrusted with the promotion of geothermal energy. EG was formed
through a Govemment decree dated December 22 1995. The majority shareholder of the company is the
Govemment of Lithuania (GOL) through its Ministry of Energy. LPC remains a minority shareholder of
the company.
3.2          The focus of the company is the development of the geothermal resources in Lithuania.
To that end, EG will act as project promoter, developer and operator/administrator. Given the financial
constraints on the company, it intends initially to focus on the implementation of the Klaipeda geothermal
project. Subsequently, and subject to access to soft financing, it will promote other projects in Lithuania
(such as development of the Vidmantai wells or a new geothermal facility at Silute). The company has,
as a middle term goal, to become a provider of expertise in geothermal energy and the utilization of hot
industrial waters, and operate not only in Lithuania, but also in the other Baltic countries.
3.3          The shareholders' agreement between GOL and LPC dated February 15, 1996 provides
that the initial capital of the company will be LT 5.8 million. The company will issue 0.58 million shares
with a par value of LT 10 each. It is expected that the capital contribution of LPC, of LT 2,793,800
LT, will be in kind (essentially the two geotherrnal wells at Vidmantai referred to above), and will not
increase in the future. On the other hand, the Government is expected to contribute initially LT 3.0
million, and during project implementation, will contribute an additional 45.5 million LT. As a result,
the Govemment share will increase from 52% in early 1996 to 94%. Each percentage in shareholding
gives the right to appoint a Director to the company's Board. While EG has been set up as a closed joint
stock company, the Shareholders' Agreement provides that the acquisition of shares is open to new
investors under certain conditions.
3.4          EG has a Board of Directors comprising five members, of which three represent the
Government and the others LPC. The Chairman of the Board is the Undersecretary of the Ministry of
Energy. The Board meets about four times annually. The Board determines policy and has the authority
to approve the annual work program and the budget, to approve the appointment of senior personnel, and
to approve the interim and annual accounts of EG. The day to day management of the company is
delegated to the Managing Director.
B. Organization and Management
3.5          EG has a permanent staff of seven. It is headed by a Managing Director with a solid
background in geothermal energy. The staff comprises an accountant, an engineer, and an economist, as
well as a draftsman and a secretary. During Project preparation, EG obtained technical assistance from
a Swedish energy utility, ' provided through a Swedish grant; under this assistance, a Business Plan was
prepared, and endorsed by EG. In addition, the contractual framework for the Project was elaborated. EG
will undoubtedly need managerial assistance in the future, if it is to achieve its corporate goals (para. 3.2).

This will be particularly the case if EG decides to bring additional partners to the project.' Arrangements
are presently underway to secure the above-mentioned managerial assistance, and the Swedish Government
has verbally agreed to provide this assistance through Sida.
C. Project Implementation and Supervision
3.6          EG will be responsible for Project implementation. EG will be assisted, as required, by
international consultants2 to support the preparation of technical specifications, bidding documents,
, -ndering, bid evaluation, contract awards, supervision of civil works and equipment installation, and
follow-up activities.
3.7          The proposed Project would be supervised by Bank personnel from both headquarters and
the Riga and Vilnius offices of the Regional Mission for the Baltic Countries. In addition, representatives
of the Danish EPA would also participate in supervision missions. A proposed supervision plan is
presented in Annex 1, Chart 2.
3.8          Recognizing that the proposed Project would be the first Bank project in Lithuania
involving installation of sophisticated mechanical and electrical equipment for transferring geothermal
energy to a district heating system, it is anticipated that it would require significant supervision (about 20
sw/year). This supervision would be particularly intensive during the first two years when considerable
input would be required for engineering and procurement aspects. During the last year, supervision would
be reduced to about 15 sw/.
D. Reports, Accounts and Audits
3.9          During negotiations, an understanding was reached on the scope of reporting on financial,
managerial and technical matters pertaining to EG in general, and the Project in particular. In particular,
EG is expected, with the support of the Project Coordinator, to submit to the Bank semi-annual progress
reports on each project component, estimated and revised costs, schedule, objective, and activity.
3.10         To monitor the financial perfonnance of EG, assurances were obtained during negotiations
that: (i) it will submit on a semi-annual basis financial progress reports in which the actual results would
be compared with the Budgets; and (ii) it will appoint independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank to
audit its accounts, as well as its Project accounts on an annual basis, and the audit reports will be
submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year. EG also agreed during negotiations
to submit Progress Reports and a Completion Report in accordance with Bank Guidelines.

IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. Background
4.1          The executing agency for the project will be the newly created Enterprise Geoterma (EG),
whose staff was previously employed by a branch of the Lithuania Power Company (LPC). EG is a Joint
Stock Company, whose majority owner is the Government of Lithuania and in which LPC has a minority
stake (para. 3.3). The company has only one significant asset, i.e. two wells drilled, but not completed
at Vidmantai, at a cost of about US$0.7 million. These wells will constitute the contribution of LPC to
the equity of the company. The opening Balance Sheet of EG, confirmed by the Financial Directors of
EG and LPC, was recently received and found satisfactory.
4.2          The heat output resulting from the Project will be used by the Klaipeda District Heating
Enterprise (KDHE), a branch of LPC. The financial standing of LPC and KDHE is critical to the future
performance of EG, given that it will be the sole buyer of heat, once the Project has been commissioned.
The financial records of KDHE are incomplete, for instance: (a) services provided by LPC headquarters
are not charged; (b) branches do not have assets registers; and (c) branches do not have their own capital.
Under the circumstances, special contractual arrangements had to be elaborated to protect EG's investment
in the Project (see section D).
B. Financial Framework for Enterprise Geoterma
4.3          EG at present does not have any extemal source of revenues. As a result, during Project
implementation, it needs extemal support. To that end, the Government has agreed to support EG through
annual grants sufficient to cover its operating expenses during Project implementation.
4.4           Once the Project is commissioned, EG will sell heat to KDHE, a branch of LPC. Detailed
financial projections for EG are at Annex 1.2. Their supporting assumptions are at Annex 1.3. Important
assumptions made are that: (a) in the coming years, EG will be solely concemed with the implementation
of the proposed Project (to be fully-financed by external sources); (b) EG will not undertake any new
ventures and/or incur borrowings beyond those contemplated for the Project; (c) the Project will be built
within the estimated costs and time frame, and yield the anticipated benefits; and (d) the selling price of
heat will be US$100/ton of mazut equivalent. The resulting financial projections can be summarized as
follows in Table 4.1:

Debt Service Coverage Ratio         2.9      1.4     1.1     1.1
4.5          As the above table indicates, following project completion: (i) EG will operate at a loss,
but have a positive operating income; (ii) its debt equity ratio will remain adequate, below 50:50; and (iii)



20                                                                                  Chapter IV
most importantly, it will have a positive cash flow, yet its debt service coverage ratio will remain modest,
of the order of 1.1. The financial prognosis would have been more encouraging had EG not been
subjected to a flat tax equivalent to 1% of its gross assets, which will account for more than 10% of its
revenues.
4.6           EG's financial performance in its initial years will undoubtedly be precarious, particularly
given its reliance on a single Project to achieve financial security. Furthermore, the company will confront
specific financial risks related to Project construction (cost overruns, delays, geological risks etc.) and
operation (perforrnance of geothermal wells, cost of inputs' ). In order to mitigate the financial risks, the
Project is to be largely financed by equity (67%). Furthermore, during negotiations EG agreed to: (i)
submit not later than October 31 of each year its operating and capital budget, as well as the budget of
the Projectfor Bank approval; and (ii) not to enter into new geothermal ventures, and/or incur new long
term debt without the prior agreement of the Bank Given these assurances, the financial risks related to
EG's operations have been reasonably mitigated.
C. Financial Standing of District Heating
4.7           Another area of concern is the financial standing of the district heating enterprise KDHE,
which will use the output of the Project. In recent years, LPC has been operating at a loss, largely
attributable to the district heating operations. This is illustrated by LPC's financial results for 1994 in
Table 4.2. The main cause for the losses has been the insufficiency of the residential heat tariff in
relation to the cost of fuels. The Government is aware of the problem, and has significantly increased
those tariffs from 19 LT/Gcal in 1993, to 37 LT/Gcal in 1994 and 83 LT/Gcal in 1995. Nevertheless, one
has to recognize that: (a) according to Government estimates, district heating already accounts for 15%
of consumers' income;2 (b) individual household extensions are not equipped with meters or regulators
so that consumers cannot control their consumption in accordance with needs; and (c) district heating
enterprises are not yet equipped to operate on a commercial basis. As a result, at this juncture, losses
from the district heating activity are expected to be covered by a combination of a surcharge on electricity
tariffs and Govemrnment subsidies3.
4.8           In this respect, within the framework of the Power Rehabilitation Project4 the Government
and the Bank agreed that: (a) for all practical purposes, power and heat tariffs, together with Government
subsidies, will be sufficient to cover costs and allow a reasonable return on investments; and (b) subsidies
will be gradually phased out. As indicated in Table 4.2, LPC made a loss in excess of US $77 million
in 1994. Government subsidies amounted to US $22 million. The gap was covered essentially by
borrowings and delayed payments to suppliers. In November 1995, the Government and LPC submitted
a financial action plan to the Bank having as an initial target cost recovery, and aiming to rehabilitate the
sector's finances in the medium term. LPC has so far made improvements in regard to collection of
I      In particular, electricity will account for 65% of the cost of operating the plant, and in excess of 25% of
EG's operating expenses.
2      The Government subsidies low income households for the portion of the heat bill (heat and hot water) which
exceeds 20% of income.
3      Industrial tariffs, at 75 LT/Gcal broadly cover costs.

4.9            In addition, the systemic issues of the District Heating sector in Lithuania -- including
tariffs, operational efficiency, and ownership -- are expected to be addressed under the Second Energy
Project currently under preparation. In this respect, LPC is expected to submit to the Bank a program for
the transfer of district heating systems to district/municipal, and/or private sector ownership. Furthermore,
it is also understood that municipalities have expressed interest in owning heat supply assets for providing
heat to their constituents. This could prove a better institutional framework in the long term, provided
that the heat supply activity is financially viable.
D. Financial/Contrmetual Arrangements for Project Operations
4.10            Once the project is commissioned, EG will sell heat to KDHE, a branch of LPC. Given
the high investment being contemplated for the geothermal plant and the project being designed to provide
heat to KDHE, a take or pay contract between EG and KDHE on behalf of LPC has been entered into.
The contract provides that, over a 25 year period, KDHE is, under normal circumstances, obligated to
accept a quantity up to an amount equal to the base load heat demand over the year: currently equal to
475 GWh corresponding to an effect of 55.8 MW or 48 Gcal/h. The price to be paid will be based on
actual heat production cost (border price, custom duty, transport, storage, handling in Klaipeda,



22                                                                             Chapter IV
environmental fees) for KDHE during the previous quarter, inclusive of taxes. The contract also specifies
that the obligation to purchase will start on January 1, 1999. This contract ensures that EG, upon Project
completion, will have a ready buyer for its heat, and secures the price at which it will be compensated.
In this respect, this sets an important precedent for the future of the geothermal activity in Lithuania.
During negotiations it was agreed that LPC will take all necessary measures to ensure that KDHE
complies with its obligations wider the take or pay contract.



V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
5.1          The proposed geothermal demonstration project is aimed at: (a) developing an unutilized
indigenous energy resource which would mitigate the emission of green-house gases (GHG); and (b)
demonstrating that the resource can be used cost-effectively to partially replace fossil fuels in the district
heating (DH) systems in Lithuania. Development of indigenous geothermal resources is an integral part
of Lithuania's Energy Development Program as it would reduce the country's dependence on energy
imports (over 98% of primary energy is imported) and also mitigate environmentally damaging emissions.
In the base case, it is expected that 530 Terajoules (TJ) of geothermal energy can be reliably extracted and
delivered to the Klaipeda DH system. Additional amounts of heat could be extracted, without additional
investment or operating costs in the geothermal plant, if: (a) the temperature in the geothermal aquifer is
at the higher end of the range expected; and (b) the DH system is itself rehabilitated and modified to
improve its operating efficiency, thereby lowering the temperature regime in the network and increasing
the utilization level of geothermal energy. Under optimal conditions the annual energy yield could reach
650 TJ.
5.2          The replicability of the proposed demonstration plant, from economic, financial and
technical points of view, can be fully assessed only after the demonstration plant is operational. However,
it is expected that a subsequent plant could be built at a lower capital cost by maximizing local engineering
and other technical skills developed through transfer of technology under the demonstration project. The
economic analysis has been done for the demonstration plant and for a subsequent plant built at a lower
capital cost, assuming the base case scenario of 530 TJ/year heat extraction. Additional scenarios,
reflecting both down-side risks and the possible additional benefits, have been incorporated into the
sensitivity analysis (Tables 5.5 and 5.6).
A. Project Benefits
5.3           Both mazut (heavy fuel oil with 3-3.5% sulfur) and natural gas are presently used in
Lithuania's DH systems. The economic value of geothermal energy is based on substituting freely traded
-mazut (the dominant fuel), the price (border price and internal transport cost) of which is presently market
based in Lithuania. The efficiency of mazut boilers (around 85%) and the operating costs of delivery,
storage, etc. (5% of fuel price) have been added to the fuel price. National and global (carbon mitigation)
environmental benefits have been added to the basic benefits of fossil fuel substitution. Additional benefits
would include the development of an environmentally attractive indigenous and renewable energy resource
and a slight improvement in energy independence (over 98% of fuels are presently imported). Cost
estimates are largely based on imported equipment and technical assistance for the demonstration plant,
and a reduction in these costs through the expanded use of local resources for any successor plant.
Valuation of benefits is based on:
Mg=: The average price of mazut delivered to Klaipeda in 1994 was US $66/ton (about the same
as 1993). Local prices increased in early 1995 to about US $110-115/ton and dropped to around
US $90-95/ton by mid-March. Local prices during early 1996 has reacged US $125-135/ton.
Average Rotterdam prices over the last six months were US $107/ton for 1 % sulfur heavy fuel oil
and US $95/ton for 3 % sulfur mazut (both cif). Based on these prices and recent price trends, it
has been assumed that the price of mazut (3% sulfur) will reach about US $100/ton (in January
1995 dollars) by 1998, the time the proposed plant starts operating. This is comparable with the
present price of natural gas in Lithuania (US $90/thousand cubic meters), which has remained

relatively stable over the last two years.
*    Environmental Benefits:  Based on Bank estimates for similar projects in other comparable
countries, the following values have been used: S02 - US$ 600/ton, NQ - US $250/ton, and
particulates - US $1000/ton, CO2 - US $7/ton (US $25/ton of carbon). Mitigation of carbon
emissions is assumed to be a global, and not a national, benefit.
5.4             Estimated reductions in mazut and natural gas, and the relevant pollutant emissions are
presented in Tables 5.1.

B. Project Economic Costs
5.5             Capital Costs (all costs in constant March 1995 US $!. As this is a demonstration project,
investment and start-up costs are estimated to be substantially higher than for a subsequent plant, which
would employ a greater proportion of local engineering and technical inputs based on the transfer of
technology achieved through the demonstration project. Investment costs (including physical contingencies)
are estimated at US $16.3 million for the demonstration project and US $13.0 million for a subsequent
plant. Base costs include engineering and technical assistance, drilling of production and re-injection wells,
and plant construction. Past exploration costs are treated as "sunk" costs; additional exploration costs are
not expected as the resources are well-documented.
5.6             Operatin  and Maintenance (O&M) Costs. Costs were supplied by consultants and consist
mainly of electricity (for pumping and circulation), maintenance, and salaries. The economic price of
electricity has been assumed at US cents 4.0/kWh (this would be higher if nuclear plant retirement costs
'vere included). Annual O&M costs are estimated at about US $0.51 million for the first 2 years during
which international TA is required, and US $0.45 million after that.
5.7            Capital and O&M costs per unit of geothermal heat utilized are sensitive to the level of heat
extracted from the geothermal water. These costs are compared in Table 5.2.

5.8             Because of the high capital costs per unit of heat extracted (Table 5.2), the economic
viability of geothermal energy in Lithuania is sensitive to the quantity of heat extracted and the price of the
alternative fuel. Reference prices (excluding environmental costs) are presented in Table 5.3 for
comparison with the costs of geothermal heat production shown in Table 5.2.

C. Economic Rate of Return

C       Global environmental benefits include national benefits and reduced CO2 emissions
5.10            The basic conclusions derived from the economic analysis are:
*    Demonstration Plant:  Without taking into account environmental benefits, the proposed
demonstration plant is not economically viable. However, grants from the GEF and the Danish
EPA, aimed at promoting GHG mitigating technologies, would allow the project to meet its
recurring costs and debt-service obligations under the expected circumstances. In order to yield
a real economic rate of return (ERR) of 10%, energy extraction should be raised to 780 TJ/year
or the price of the fuel substituted (mazut) would have to be 50% higher than the $100/ton level
anticipated. It is estimated that this extraction could be achieved under the 'best case" technical
scenario under which: (a) geothermal resources were at 48 IC instead of 42 IC assumed in the base
case (to be confirmed through the demonstration plant); and (b) priority investments were
undertaken to improve the efficiency of the district heating systems to which geothermal heat

would be supplied (this is to be implemented under a separate project for which Bank support has
been sought by the Govermment of Lithuania).
Successor Plant: Based on expected reductions in capital costs and stable fossil fuel prices (US
$100/ton of mazut), any successor geothermal plant would need to supply at least 660 TJ/year in
order to yield an ERR of 10%. This is within the range of technical possibilities (Table 5.5).
Modifications to the DH networks, expected to be undertaken in the near future, by themselves are
expected to have an ERR above 20%, and would allow this level of geothermal heat extraction.
Alternatively, mazut prices would need to be 25 % higher than the level anticipated to yield an ERR
of 10%.
5.11         Including the global benefits the Project receives an ERR of 11.7%. The high reduction
of CO2 has rewarded the Project with a substantial grant from the GEF; US $6.9 million. As can be seen
in pra 5.3 the global value of CO2 is US $7/ton. The utilizing of the GEF grant corresponds at a cost of
US $ 5.3/ton for sequestering CO2 over the lifetime of the Project.
D. Project Risks and Sensitivity Analysis
5.12         TehnicaL Riskm. The geothermal resources in the region have been extensively explored
and are well documented. Also the technology proposed for utilization of the available low-enthalpy
geothermal heat in existing district heating networks is well developed and is being employed in several
European towns and cities. However, location-specific technical risks remain connected with the
geothermal resources and the condition and operation of the DH system to be supplied. Specific sub-
surface risks are related to: (a) the sustainable level (rate) of geothermal water that can be extracted; and
(b) the temperature of the geothermal water. These risks can only be fully assessed through undertaking
the demonstration project. However, no limitations are expected in the rate of extraction and the
temperatures are expected to be in the 420 to 480C range.
5.13         Above surface uncertainties are mainly associated with the temperature of the return water
in the DH system and the amount of make-up water added to the system (as both these streams are to be
heated by the extracted geothermal heat). The lower the return temperature and the greater the level of
make-up water, the higher the amount of geothermal heat which can be utilized, thereby improving the
project's economic viability. General efficiency enhancing rehabilitation of the DH system is expected to
reduce the average return temperature and reduce the level of make-up water.
5.14         Furthermore, during summer time when the Easter Boiler House is shut down, the required
driving energy to absorption heat pumps needs to be supplied from a separate steam or hot water boiler.
This boiler is currently not available at KDHE, but the Swiss Government has declared its willingness to
provide the required grant funding to cover manufacturing and installation costs of the boiler at KDHE.
5.15         The amount of geothermal energy that is expected to be utilized (with no increase in capital
and operating costs) under different possible scenarios of aquifer temperatures and return water
temperatures are presented below in Table 5.5.

5.16            The other main project risks stem  from  possible cost overruns, delays in plant
commissioning, and a fall in the prices of the fossil fuels to be partially substituted by the extracted
geothermal heat. The implementation related risks have been addressed through appropriate start-up
assistance and by establishing EG as an independent, commercially managed coroporation. Fuel prices
are hard to predict, but have remained above the "switching" value of US $92/ton of mazut from January
to May 1995 (Table 5.6(b)). Additional project risks include the inability of the geothermal heat supply
company EG to recover its supply costs from the DH company, and be financially viable and independent
to pursue the further commercialization of geothermal energy in Lithuania and elsewhere. Risks associated
with cost recovery and the financial viability of the Project, will be mitigated through a heat supply contract
between EG and LPC, on behalf of the KDHE, which provides EG with the cash flow needed to operate
independently and pursue the future development of geothermal energy.
5.17            Snsitivi  Anaysis: Base case benefits are conservative with respect to the amount of heat
that can be extracted from the demonstration and successor plants. Aquifer temperatures are assumed to
be at the low end of the range expected, and larger amounts of geothermal water could be obtained.
Environmental benefits have been excluded from the sensitivity analysis but, if included, would
substantially increase the ERR as seen in Table 5.5. The economic sensitivity of the proposed Project, and
any successor plant, has been assessed conservatively by: (a) determining the values for geothermal heat
extraction, capital costs and mazut prices which would yield an ERR of 10% (switching values); and (b)
determining the impact on the base case ERR if average mazut prices remained depressed (at 85 % of the
expected level). Worst and best case scenarios, under which heat extraction remains at the base-case level,
and capital costs and mazut prices vary simultaneously by ± 10% and ± 15 % respectively, have also been
considered. As a separate case, capital costs for the demonstration plant have been reduced by the foreign
grant contribution of US $9.5 million in order to test whether the proposed project can cover its recurring
costs and debt-service obligations under the sensitivity scenarios considered. The analysis is presented in
Table 5.6(a) and (b).

5.18         The following key conclusions can be derived from the sensitivity analysis:
(a)  The demonstration plant will need grant funds in order to be financially sustainable; grant fiuds
already secured would allow the plant to cover its recurring costs and debt service obligations.
The plant could maintain a 10% financial rate of return on its non-grart capital if total capital costs
increased by 15%, fuel prices dropped by 8% (to US $92/ton), or heat extraction dropped to 485
TJ/year.
(b) Under the base case scenario, a successor plant would need to extract at least 660 Tl/year of
geothermal heat in order to yield an ERR of 10% (excluding environmental benefits). This level
of extraction is within the range of technical possibilities when pursued in combination with
expected network modifications.  Its achievement could be better defined through the
demonstration plant and further facilitated through efficiency-enhancing network modifications.
Under the best scenario expected, geothermal heat production would be about 770 TJ/year. The
successor plant is sensitive to changes in capital costs and the prices of substitute fossil fuels. A
reduction in capital costs by 25% (to US $9.8 million excluding price contingencies) or an increase
in substitute fuel (mazut) prices to US $125/ton (in constant 1995 US $) would be needed to yield
a 10% ERR. These switching values are not expected to be reached.
5.19         Imac on Energy Imports. Lithuania's low temperature geothermal resources would be
utilized mainly to complement centralized district heating systems by substituting part of the base load
supply presently provided by fossil fuels. It is estimated that about 10% of this heat supply in about seven
cities could be substituted by geothermal energy. Based on a total production of 51,014 TJ of hot water
from centralized heat-only boilers in 1994, geothermal energy could conceivably replace 5,000 TJ (about
120,000 toe) of imported fossil fuels, or about 2% of total 1994 fossil fuel imports.
5.20         Economic Performance Criteria. Specific parameters which will be monitored during
project implementation because of their potential impact on the economic viability of the proposed Project
(and any subsequent geothermal plants) will include: (a) capital and operating costs; (b) sales price of
geothermal energy (equal to price of substituted fuel); (c) quantity of geothermal heat extracted and sold;
and (d) operating conditions of the DH system needed to optimize the use of geothermal energy.

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
I. THE PROJECT
A. Introduction
1.           This Project Implementation Plan (PIP) was prepared during appraisal and was agreed
during negotiations with the borrower in accordance with procedures set out in the OPIBP/GB 10.00'.
The complete project design is presented as an overview in Chart 1.
B. Project Scope and Objectives
2.            The Klaipeda Geothermal Demonstration Project (the Project), the first geothermal
investment Project in Lithuania, has the following main objectives:
*     demonstrate the use of a renewable indigenous energy resource to replace currently
imported fossil fuels;
*     reduce the emission of GHG and SO2 by replacing heavy oil (mazut with a S-content of
3.5); and
*     promote sustainable management and development of geothermal resources both from the
national and regional perspectives.
C. Project Description
3 .           The proposed Project would be developed as an environmental/energy management
project in the city of Klaipeda. The Project has two complementary components:
(a) Technical Assistance and Training Component (a more detailed description is found in Annex
1.1):
*     design of the geothermal loop including all necessary equipment for extracting the heat
from the geothermal water and transferring it to the district heating system;
*     preparation of detailed drilling, testing and completion programs;
*     management support for project implementation, including support in preparing the tender
OPR issued new procedures on September 17, 1993 requiring that an Implementation Plan be prepared and included
in the Staff Appraisal Report. These procedures have been incorporated and issued in the OP/BP/GB 10.00, lnvestmnent
Lending: Identification to Board Approval."



2                                                                             Annex I
documents, construction supervision; and
*     training of Lithuanian staff and management in operation of the geothermal plant in
Thisted, Denmark to optimize the transfer of technology.
(b) Investment Component:
*     establishment of two production wells and one injection well;
*     above ground facilities including building and necessary equipment such as absorption
heat pumps, heat exchanger, and auxiliary equipment for control and regulation of the
plant and the heat transfer to the district heating system; and
*     piping between production wells and geothermal plant, as well as piping from the
geothermal plant to the injection well, and piping between the geothermal plant and the
district heating network.
4.           Technologv. The proposed geothermal project involves the circulation of 600 m3/h of
42°C geothermal water from about 1,200 meters depth via a closed geothermal loop, utilizing a heat
exchanger and heat pumps for the retrieval and subsequent supply of heat into the existing district heating
network in Klaipeda. The geothermal water would be extracted from two production wells and returned
with reduced temperatures to the same depth to maintain formation pressure and to avoid creating water
pollution problems. The technology proposed for utilization of the available low temperature geothermal
heat in existing district heating networks is well developed and is being employed in several European
towns and cities.  A more detailed description of the proposed geothermal plant (designed for the
production of 530 Terajoules (TJ) per year) is presented in Annex 3.
5.           Energy savings. The feasibility study prepared by Danish consultants and funded by the
Danish EPA indicated that a suitable size of the demonstration plant could provide about 10% of the total
heat demand to the Klaipeda District Heating System, which is about 5,600 TJ/year. Energy could be
extracted from the geothermal water by using heat pump technology based on absorption heat pumps.
The feasibility study also determined that by reducing the temperature regime in the district heating
network, an additional 24% of geothermal energy could be extracted without any additional investments.
The geothermal plant proposed by the consultants would produce 530 TJ without reduction of the network
temperature. This latter energy amount corresponds to about 16,500 tons of oil or 19.5 million m3 of
natural gas.
6.           Enviromnental benefits. The proposed Project would have only positive environmental
impacts as no emisdons would be generated by the Project, and it would also significantly reduce the use
of fossil fuels. Due to higher prices for natural gas compared to HFO with high sulfur content (3.5%),
it is anticipated that the geothermal energy from the Project would reduce both oil and gas consumption.
The KGDPC would result in annual reductions in emissions of CO2 and NO, by 47,800 and 310 tons
respectively based on replacement of natural gas, and 51,940 and 265 tons respectively if HFO is
replaced. In addition the replacement of HFO would result in an additional reduction of SO2 of about
1160 tons per year.

D. Finance
7.            Background. The executing agency for the project will be the newly created Enterprise
Geoterma (EG), whose staff was previously employed by a branch of the Lithuania Power Company
(LPC). EG is a Joint Stock Company, whose majority owner is the Goverrnent of Lithuania and in
which LPC has a minority stake (para. 3.3). The company has only one significant asset, i.e. two wells
drilled, but not completed at Vidmantai, at a cost of about US$0.7 million. These wells will constitute
the contribution of LPC to the equity of the company. The opening Balance Sheet of EG, confirmed by
the Financial Directors of EG and LPC, was recently received and found satisfactory.
8.            The heat output resulting from the Project will be used by the Klaipeda District Heating
Enterprise (KDHE), a branch of LPC. The financial standing of LPC and KDHE is critical to the future
oerformance of EG, given that it will be the sole buyer of heat, once the Project has been commissioned
The financial records of KDHE are incomplete, for instance: (a) services provided by LPC headquarters
are not charged; (b) branches do not have assets registers; and (c) branches do not have their own capital.
Under the circumstances, special contractual arrangements had to be elaborated to protect EG's
investment in the Project.
9.            Financial Framework for Enterprise Geoterma. EG at present does not have any external
source of revenues. As a result, during Project implementation, it needs external support. To that end,
the Government has agreed to support EG through annual grants sufficient to cover its operating expenses
during Project implementation.
10.          Once the Project is commissioned, EG will sell heat to KDHE. Detailed financial
projections for EG are at Annex 1.1. Their supporting assumptions are at Annex 1.2 Important
assumptions made are that: (a) in the coming years, EG will be solely concerned with the implementation
of the proposed Project (to be fully-financed by external sources); (b) EG will not undertake any new
ventures and/or incur borrowings beyond those contemplated for the Project; (c) the Project will be built
within the estimated costs and time frame, and yield the anticipated benefits; and (d) the selling price of
heat will be US$100/ton of mazut equivalent. The resulting financial projections can be summarized as
follows in Table 1:

11.          As the above table indicates, following project completion: (i) EG will operate at a loss,
but have a positive operating income; (ii) its debt equity ratio will remain adequate, below 50:50; and (iii)
most importantly, it will have a positive cash flow, yet its debt service coverage ratio will remain modest,



Project Implementation Plan                                                                  5
of the order of 1.1. The financial prognosis would have been more encouraging had EG not been subjected
to a flat tax equivalent to 1% of its gross assets, which will account for more than 10% of its revenues.
12.           EG's financial performance in its initial years will undoubtedly be precarious, particularly
given its reliance on a single Project to achieve financial security. Furthermore, the company will confront
specific financial risks related to Project construction (cost overruns, delays, geological risks etc.) and
operation (performance of geothermal wel!s, cost of inputs' ). In order to mitigate the financial risks, the
Project is to be largely financed by equity (67%). Furthermore, during negotiations EG agreed to: (i)
submit not later than October 31 of each year its operating and capital budget, as well as the budget of
the Project for Bank approval; and f(i) not to enter into new geothermal ventures, and/or incur new long
term debt without the prior agreement of the Bank Given these assurances, the financial risks related to
EG's operations have been reasonably mitigated.
13.           Financial Standing of District Heating. Another area of concern is the financial standing
of the district heating enterprise KDHE, which will use the output of the Project. In recent years, LPC has
been operating at a loss, largely attributable to the district heating operations. This is illustrated by LPC's
financial results for 1994 in Table 2. The main cause for the losses has been the insufficiency of the
residential heat tariff in relation to the cost of fuels. The Government is aware of the problem, and has
significantly increased those tariffs from 19 LT/Gcal in 1993, to 37 LT/Gcal in 1994 and 83 LT/Gcal in
1995. Nevertheless, one has to recognize that: (a) according to Govemment estimates, district heating
already accounts for 15% of consumers' income2; (b) individual household extensions are not equipped
with meters or regulators so that consumers cannot control their consumption in accordance with needs;
and (c) district heating enterprises are not yet equipped to operate on a commercial basis. As a result, at
this juncture, losses from the district heating activity are expected to be covered by a combination of a
surcharge on electricity tariffs and Government subsidies3.
14.           In this respect, within the framework of the Power Rehabilitation Project4 the Government
and the Bank agreed that: (a) for all practical purposes, power and heat tariffs, together with Govemment
subsidies, will be sufficient to cover costs and allow a reasonable return on investments; and (b) subsidies
will be gradually phased out. As indicated in Table 2, LPC made a loss in excess of US $77 million in
1994. Govermnent subsidies amounted to US $22 million. The gap was covered essentially by borrowings
and delayed payments to suppliers. In November 1995, the Govemment and LPC submitted a financial
action plan to the Bank having as an initial target cost recovery, and aiming to rehabilitate the sector's
finances in the medium term. LPC has so far made improvements in regard to collection of energy debts.
15.          In addition, the systemic issues of the District Heating sector in Lithuania -- including
tariffs, operational efficiency, and ownership -- are expected to be addressed under the Second Energy
I      In particular, electricity will account for 65% of the cost of operating the plant, and in excess of 25% of
EG's operating expenses.
2      The Government subsidies low income households for the portion of the heat bill (heat and hot water) which
exceeds 20% of income.
3      Industrial tariffs, at 75 LT/Gcal broadly cover costs.

Project currently under preparation. In this respect, LPC is expected to submit to the Bank a program for
the transfer of district heating systems to district/municipal, and/or private sector ownership. Furthermore,
it is also understood that municipalities have expressed interest in owning heat supply assets for providing
heat to their constituents. This could prove a better institutional framework in the long term, provided that
the heat supply activity is financially viable.
16.            Financial/Contractual Arrangements for Project Operations.   Once the project is
commissioned, EG will sell heat to KDHE, a branch of LPC. Given the high investment being
contemplated for the geothermal plant and the project being designed to provide heat to KDHE, a take
or pay contract between EG and KDHE has been entered into. The contract provides that, over a 25 year
period, KDHE is, under normal circumstances, obligated to accept a quantity up to an amount equal to
the base load heat demand over the year; currently equal to 475 GWh corresponding to an effect of 55.8
MW or 48 Gcal/h. The price to be paid will be based on actual heat production cost (border price, custom
duty, transport, storage, handling in Klaipeda, environmental fees) for KDHE during the previous quarter,
inclusive of taxes. The contract also specifies that the obligation to purchase will start on January 1, 1999.
This contract ensures that EG, upon Project completion, will have a ready buyer for its heat, and secures
the price at which it will be compensated. In this respect, this sets an important precedent for the future
of the geothermal activity in Lithuania. During negotiations it was agreed that LPC will take all
necessary measures to ensure that KDHE complies with its obligations under the take or pay contract

E. Project Justification and Risks
17.          The proposed geothermal demonstration project is aimed at: (a) developing an unutilized
indigenous energy resource which would mitigate the emission of green-house gases (GHG); and (b)
demonstrating that the resource can be used cost-effectively to partially replace fossil fuels in the district
heating (DH) systems in Lithuania. Development of indigenous geothermal resources is an integral part
of Lithuania's Energy Development Program as it would reduce the country's dependence on energy
imports (over 98% of primary energy is imported) and also mitigate environmentally damaging emissions.
In the base case, it is expected that 530 Terajoules (TJ) of geothermal energy can be reliably extracted
and delivered to the Klaipeda DH system. Additional amounts of heat could be extracted, without
additional investment or operating costs in the geothermal plant, if: (a) the temperature in the geothermal
aquifer is at the higher end of the range expected; and (b) the DH system is itself rehabilitated and
modified to improve its operating efficiency, thereby lowering the temperature regime in the network and
increasing the utilization level of geothermal energy. Under optimal conditions the annual energy yield
could reach 650 TJ.
18.          The replicability of the proposed demonstration plant, from economic, financial and
technical points of view, can be fully assessed only after the demonstration plant is operational. However,
it is expected that a subsequent plant could be built at a lower capital cost by maximizing local
engineering and other technical skills developed through transfer of technology under the demonstration
project. The economic analysis has been done for the demonstration plant and for a subsequent plant built
at a lower capital cost, assuming the base case scenario of 530 TJ/year heat extraction. Additional
scenarios, reflecting both down-side risks and the possible additional benefits, have been incorporated into
the sensitivity analysis.
19.          The basic conclusions derived from the economic analysis are:
*   Demonstration Plant:  Without taking into account environmental benefits, the proposed
demonstration plant is not economically viable. However, grants from the GEF and the Danish
EPA, aimed at promoting GHG mitigating technologies, would allow the project to meet its
recurring costs and debt-service obligations under the expected circumstances. In order to yield
a real economic rate of return (ERR) of 10%, energy extraction should be raised to 780 TJ/year
or the price of the fuel substituted (mazut) would have to be 50% higher than the $100/ton level
anticipated. It is estimated that this extraction could be achieved under the "best case" technical
scenario under which: (a) geothermal resources were at 48 °C instead of 42 °C assumed in the
base case (to be confirmed through the demonstration plant); and (b) priority investments were
undertaken to improve the efficiency of the district heating systems to which geothermal heat
would be supplied (this is to be implemented under a separate project for which Bank support has
been sought by the Government of Lithuania).
*   Successor Plant: Based on expected reductions in capital costs and stable-fossil fuel prices (US
$1 00/ton of mazut), any successor geothermal plant would need to supply at least 660 TJ/year in
order to yield an ERR of 10%. This is within the range of technical possibilities (Table 5.5).
Modifications to the DH networks, expected to be undertaken in the near future, by themselves
are expected to have an ERR above 20%, and would allow this level of geothermal heat
extraction. Alternatively, mazut prices would need to be 25% higher than the level anticipated
to yield an ERR of 10%. If these heat extraction or fossil fuel price thresholds were not met,
specific policy interventions such as environmental taxes on fossil fuels, or direct production

subsidies, would be required to replicate the demonstration plant economically (not considering
the environmental benefits) and financially.
20.           Proiect Benefits. Both mazut (heavy fuel oil with 3-3.5%  sulfur) and natural gas are
presently used in Lithuania's DH systems. The economic value of geothermal energy is based on
substituting freely traded mazut (the dominant fuel), the price of which is presently market based in
Lithuania. The efficiency of mazut boilers (around 85%) and the operating costs of delivery, storage, etc.
(5% of fuel price) have been added to the fuel price. National and global (carbon mitigation)
environmental benefits have been added to the basic benefits of fossil fuel substitution. Additional
benefits would include the development of an environmentally attractive indigenous and renewable energy
resource and a slight improvement in energy independence (over 98% of fuels are presently imported).
Cost estimates are largely based on imported equipment and technical assistance for the demonstration
plant, and a reduction in these costs through the expanded use of local resources for any successor plant.
Valuation of benefits is based on:
*    Mazut: The average price of mazut delivered to Klaipeda in 1994 was US $66/ton (about the
same as 1993). Local prices increased in early 1995 to about US $110-115/ton and dropped to
around US $90-95/ton by mid-March. Average Rotterdam prices over the last six months were
US $107/ton for 1% sulfur heavy fuel oil and US $95/ton for 3% sulfur mazut (both cif). Based
on these prices and recent price trends, it has been assumed that the price of mazut (3% sulfur)
will reach about US $100/ton (in January 1995 dollars) by 1998, the time the proposed plant starts
operating. This is comparable with the present price of natural gas in Lithuania (US $90/thousand
cubic meters), which has remained relatively stable over the last two years.
*    Environmental Benefits: Based on Bank estimates for similar projects in other comparable
countries, the following values have been used: SO2 - US$ 600/ton, NO. - US $250/ton, and
particulates - US $1000/ton, CO2 - US $7/ton (US $25/ton of carbon). Mitigation of carbon
emissions is assumed to be a global, and not a national, benefit.
21.           Estimated reductions in mazut and natural gas, and the relevant pollutant emissions are
presented in Table 3.

22.           Project Economic Costs (in constant March 1995 US $). As this is a demonstration
project, investment and start-up costs are estimated to be substantially higher than for a subsequent plant,
which would employ a greater proportion of local engineering and technical inputs based on the transfer
of technology achieved through the demonstration project. Investment costs (including physical
contingencies) are estimated at US $16.3 million for the demonstration project and US $13.0 million for
a subsequent plant. Base costs include engineering and technical assistance, drilling of production and

re-injection wells, and plant construction. Past exploration costs are treated as "sunk" costs; additional
exploration costs are not expected as the resources are well-documented.
23.          Operating and Maintenance (O&M) Costs. Costs were supplied by consultants and consist
mainly of electricity (for pumping and circulation), maintenance, and salaries. The economic price of
electricity has been assumed at US cents 4.0/kWh (this would be higher if nuclear plant retirement costs
were included). Annual O&M costs are estimated at about US $0.51 million for the first 2 years during
which international TA is required, and US $0.45 million after that.
24.          Capital and O&M costs per unit of geothermal heat utilized are sensitive to the level of
heat extracted from the geothermal water. These costs are compared in Table 4.

25.             Because of the high capital costs per unit of heat extracted (Table 4), the economic
viability of geothernal energy in Lithuania is sensitive to the quantity of heat extracted and the price at
which it is sold. As the sales price is linked to the prevailing market price of mazut (or natural gas).

27.             Proiect Risks and Sensitivity Analylsis. The geothermal resources in the region have been
extensively explored and are well documented. Also the technology proposed for utilization of the
available low-enthalpy geothermal heat in existing district heating networks is well developed and is being



Project Implementation Plan                                                           11
employed in several European towns and cities. However, location-specific technical risks remain
connected with the geothermal resources and the condition and operation of the DH system to be
supplied. Specific sub-surface risks are related to: (a) the sustainable level (rate) of geothermal water that
can be extracted; and (b) the temperature of the geothermal water. These risks can only be fully assessed
through undertaking the demonstration project. However, no limitations are expected in the rate of
extraction and the temperatures are expected to be in the 420 to 480 range.
28.          Above surface uncertainties are mainly associated with the temperature of the return water
in the DH system and the amount of make-up water added to the system (as both these streams are to be
heated by the extracted geothermal heat). The lower the return temperature and the greater the level of
make-up water, the higher the amount of geothermal heat which can be utilized, thereby improving the
project's economic viability. General efficiency enhancing rehabilitation of the DH system is expected
to reduce the average return temperature and reduce the level of make-up water.
29.          The amount of geothermal energy that is expected to be utilized (with no increase in
capital and operating costs) under different possible scenarios of aquifer temperatures and return water
temperatures are presented below in Table 7.
30.          The other main project risks stem from possible cost overruns, delays in plant
commissioning, and a fall in the prices of the fossil fuels to be partially substituted by the extracted
geothermal heat. The implementation related risks have been addressed through appropriate start-up
assistance and by establishing EG as an independent, commercially managed corporation. Fuel prices
are hard to predict, but have remained above the "switching" value of US $92/ton of mazut from January
to May 1995 (Table 8(b)). Additional project risks include the inability of the geothermal heat supply
company EG to recover its supply costs from the DH company, and be financially viable and independent
to pursue the further commercialization of geothermal energy in Lithuania and elsewhere. Risks
associated with cost recovery and the financial viability of the Project, will be mitigated through a heat
supply contract between EG and the KDHE which provides EG with the cash flow needed to operate
independently and pursue the future development of geothermal energy.
31.          Sensitivity Analysis: Base case benefits are conservative with respect to the amount of
heat that can be extracted from the demonstration and successor plants. Aquifer temperatures are
assumed to be at the low end of the range expected, and larger amounts of geothermal water could be
obtained. Environmental benefits have been excluded from the sensitivity analysis but, if included, would
substantially increase the ERR as seen in Table 7. The economic sensitivity of the proposed Project, and
any successor plant, has been assessed by: (a) determining the values for geothermal heat extraction,
capital costs and mazut prices which would yield an ERR of 10% (switching values); and (b) determining
the impact on the base case ERR if average mazut prices remained depressed (at 85 % of expected levels).
Worst and best case scenarios, under which heat extraction remains at the base-case level, and capital
costs and mazut prices vary simultaneously by ± 10% and ±15% respectively, have also been
considered. As a separate case, capital costs for the demonstration plant have been reduced by the
foreign grant contribution of US $9.5 million in order to test whether the proposed project can cover its
recurring costs and debt-service obligations under the sensitivity scenarios considered. The analysis is
presented in Table 8(a) and (b).

32.             The following key conclusions can be derived from the sensitivity analysis:
(a)   The demonstration plant will need grant funds in order to be financially sustainable; grant funds
already secured would allow the plant to cover its recurring costs and debt service obligations.
The plant could maintain a 10% financial rate of return on its non-grant capital if total capital
costs increased by 15%, fuel prices dropped by 8%  (to US $92/ton), or heat extraction dropped
to 485 Tl/year.
(b)  Under the base case scenario, a successor plant would need to extract at least 660 TJ/year of
geothermal heat in order to yield an ERR of 10% (excluding environmental benefits). This level
of extraction is within the range of technical possibilities when pursued in combination with
expected  network  modifications.   Its achievement could  be better defined  through  the
demonstration plant and further facilitated through efficiency-enhancing network modifications.
Under the best scenario expected, geothermal heat production would be about 770 TJ/year. The
successor plant is sensitive to changes in capital costs and the prices of substitute fossil fuels.
A reduction in capital costs by 25% (to US $9.8 million excluding price contingencies) or an
increase in substitute fuel (mazut) prices to US $125/ton (in constant 1995 US $) would be
needed to yield a 10% ERR. These switching values are not expected to be reached.
33.             Impact on Energv Imports. Lithuania's low temperature geothermal resources would be
utilized mainly to complement centralized district heating systems by substituting part of the base load
supply presently provided by fossil fuels. It is estimated that about 10% of this heat supply in about



14                                                                                              Anneir I
seven cities could be substituted by geothermal energy. Based on a total production of 51,014 TJ of hot
water from centralized heat-only boilers in 1994, geothermal energy could conceivably replace 5,000 TJ
(about 120,000 toe) of imported fossil fuels, or about 2% of total 1994 fossil fuel imports.
34.             Economic Performance Criteria. Specific parameters which will be monitored during
project implementation because of their potential impact on the economic viability of the proposed Project
(and any subsequent geothermal plants) will include: (a) capital and operating costs; (b) sales price of
geothermal energy; (c) quantity of geothermal heat extracted and sold; and (iv) operating conditions of
the DH system needed to optimize the use of geothermal energy.
F. Project Costs
35.             The total cost of the Project is estimated to be US $18.02 million or LT 72.08 million
equivalent, including contingencies, but excluding taxes. Table 9(a) shows the cost distribution by
Project component. The estirnated cost distributed among project components is shown in Table 1 of the
Project Summary and in greater detail in Table 9(b) in this Annex.
36.             The total base cost is estimated at US $15.09 million.  Physical contingencies are
estimated at US $0.75 million. Price contingencies between January 1, 1995 and December 1998 would
amount to approximately US $1.78 million or 11.2% of base cost plus physical contingencies. Total
contingencies represent 16.8% of the base cost. The foreign exchange component is estimated at
approximately US $15.01 million including contingencies, or about 83 % of the total cost of the KGDPC.

G. Financing Plan
37.             The proposed IBRD loan of US $5.9 million would finance about 32.7 % of total Project
costs. The loan would be repaid by the GOL over 20 years including 5 years grace with repayments
calculated on an annuity basis at the Bank's standard variable rate of interest.
38.             The Global Environment Facility, GEF, would cofinance the project with a grant of US
$6.9 million, equal to 38.1 % of total Project cost. Parallel cofinancing by the Govermnent of Denmark
(US $2.5 million equivalent) and the European Union (US $120,000 equivalent) comprises about 14.5%
of total project costs. The local counterpart contribution of LT 10.4 million or US $2.6 million equivalent
would be provided by the GOL. The sumunarized financing plan presented in Tables 10 and 11 show
the required financing by year and financier.

II. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
A. Organizations Responsible for the Project and Interagency Coordination
39.          Institutional Setting. The Lithuanian energy sector remains largely state-owned with
control exercised principally by the Ministry of Energy. The main operating organizations are the
Lithuanian Power Company (LPC), Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant, Lithuania Gas, Lithuanian Fuel,
Mazeikiai Oil Refinery, Klaipeda Oil Export Company, the regional gas distribution companies, and a
number of research and construction companies. With a few exceptions, enterprises are designated as
Special Purpose State-owned Enterprises, thereby giving the Government greater power to intervene than
is normal for state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
40.          LPC is the cornerstone of the electricity subsector, controlling electricity generation, the
transmission grid, inter-company trade and external contracts. LPC determines the amount of electricity
to be produced by its generating companies, contracts for fuel allocations, and pays its generators for
electricity based on production costs. All of Lithuania's district heating (DH) companies are also under
LPC control. LPC has a large number of heat-only boilers providing heat under its district heating
affiliates. Combined heat and power stations also provide heat to the district heating networks, although
the recent drop in electricity demand (due to price increases) has made this source of heat less economic
than running heat-only boilers and supplying electricity from the nuclear power plant at Ignalina.
41.          Entenprise Geoterma. Enterprise Geoterma (EG), which will be responsible for the
implementation of the Project, was earlier a branch of LPC and responsible for the development of the
Lithuanian geothermal resources. By Government decree no. 1609 December 22, 1995, EG was
corporatized and established as an independent closed joint stock company, with the Government as the
majority shareholder. EG became registered as a legal entity March 1, 1996 at Vilnius City Council;
registration no. AB96-269.
B. Agreements between Borrower and Implementing Agencies
42.          The following agreements were reached between the Borrower and the Implementing
Agencies during negotiations:
(a)    The Borrower would identify how their counterpart contributions would be provided and
specify the procedures to be used for on-lending through the MOF to EG.
(b)    EG has nominated the personnel for carrying out the Project;
(c)    The MOE and EG agreed to the implnentation plan for the Project;
(d)   The MOE will undertake to obtain all required Permits and Licenses;
(e)    The MOE and MOEP will work to ensure more stringent enforcement of air pollution
regulations; and
(f)    The transfer price for geothermal energy between KDHE and EG will be established
according to a formula.



18                                                                              Annex I
C. Responsibilities of Implementlng Agencies
43.          Enterprise Geoterma. The implementing agency for the Project will be the closed joint
stock company Enterprise Geoterma (EG). Its staff was previously employed by the Lithuanian Power
Company (LPC), within which it constituted a unit entrusted with the promotion of geothermal energy.
EG was formed through a Government decree dated December 22 1995. The majority shareholder of
the company is the Government of Lithuania (GOL) through its Ministry of Energy. LPC remains a
minority shareholder of the company.
44.          The focus of the company is the development of the geothermal resources in Lithuania.
To that end, EG will act as project promoter, developer and operator/administrator. Given the financial
constraints on the company, it intends initially to focus on the implementation of the Klaipeda geothermal
project. Subsequently, and subject to access to soft financing, it will promote other projects in Lithuania
(such as development of the Vidmantai wells or a new geothermal facility at Silute). The company has,
as a middle term goal, to become a provider of expertise in geothermal energy and the utilization of hot
industrial waters, and operate not only in Lithuania, but also in the other Baltic countries.
45.          The shareholders' agreement between GOL and LPC dated February 15, 1996 provides
that the initial capital of the company will be LT 5.8 million. The company will issue 0.58 million shares
with a par value of LT 10 each. It is expected that the capital contribution of LPC, of LT 2,793,800
LT, will be in kind (essentially the two geothermal wells at Vidmantai referred to above), and will not
increase in the future. On the other hand, the Government is expected to contribute initially LT 3.0
million, and during project implementation, will contribute an additional 45.5 million LT. As a result,
the Government share will increase from 52% in early 1996 to 94%. Each percentage in shareholding
gives the right to appoint a Director to the company's Board. While EG has been set up as a closed joint
stock company, the Shareholders' Agreement provides that the acquisition of shares is opened to new
investors under certain conditions.
46.          EG has a Board of Directors comprising five members, of which three represent the
Government and the others LPC. The Chairman of the Board is the Undersecretary of the Ministry of
Energy. The Board meets about four times annually. The Board determines policy and has the authority
to approve the annual work program and the budget, to approve the appointment of senior personnel, and
to approve the interim and annual accounts of EG. The day to day management of the company is
delegated to the Managing Director.
47.          Organizat ion and Management. EG has a permanent staff of seven. It is headed by a
Managing Director with a solid background in geothermal energy. The staff comprises an accountant,
an engineer, and an economist, as well as a draftsman and a secretary. During Project preparation, EG
obtained technical assistance from a Swedish energy utility, ' provided through a Swedish grant; under
this assistance, a Business Plan was prepared, and endorsed by EG. In addition, the contractual
framework for the Project was elaborated. EG will undoubtedly need managerial assistance in the future,
if it is to achieve its corporate goals. This will be particularly the case if EG decides to bring additional
Lunds Energy AB.

partners to the project. ' Arrangements are presently underway to secure this assistance, and the Swedish
Government has verbally agreed to provide this assistance through Sida.
48.           Proiect IMIlementation. EG will be responsible for Project implementation. EG will be
assisted, as required, by international consultants to support the preparation of technical specifications,
bidding documents, tendering, bid evaluation, contract awards, supervision of civil works and equipment
installation, and follow-up activities.
49.           Other specific responsibilities of the EG under supervision of the Project Coordinator are
the following:
(a)    improve and finalize TORs, preparation of short-lists, and technical evaluation of TA
proposals received;
(b)    preparation of detailed specifications and procurement documents for approved equipment
lists, review of bid packages and evaluation of offers received;
(c)    prepare and submit disbursement requests to the Bank and bilateral donors;
(d)    monitoring of detailed procedures, implementation schedules, and program(s);
(e)    review of physical targets and preparation of revised estimates of financial resources
needed to support future actions;
(f)    liaise with the Bank and other involved agencies for Project administration and
supervision matters;
(g)    prepare and distribute consolidated periodic reports to the MOE, MOF and other
participating institutions, including the Bank, reflecting: (i) the status of implementation
progress, problems encountered and corrective actions needed; and (ii) current costs of
each Project sub-component and estimated costs of completion;
(h)    ensure the timely preparation and submission to the Bank of annual audit reports of
Project expenditure, including Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) and accounts; and
(i)    prepare a draft Implementation Completion Report (ICR) within six months after the
completion of the Project.
D. Role of the World Bank during Supervision
50.           The proposed Project would be supervised by Bank personnel from both headquarters and
the Riga and Vilnius offices of the Regional Mission for the Baltic Countries. In addition, representatives
of the Danish Ministry of Environment and Energy would also participate in supervision missions.
A potential investor has indicated tentative interest in taking a participation in the Project.

51.             Recognizing that the proposed Project would be the first project in Lithuania involving
installation of sophisticated mechanical and electrical equipment for transferring geothermal energy to
district heating system, it is anticipated that it would require significant supervision. This supervision
would focus on the first two years when considerable input would be required for engineering and
procurement aspects.
52.             A mid-term review would be conducted to evaluate project progress and assess the status
of actions to be undertaken to ascertain a successful Project implementation and to strengthen EG's
managerial capacity for further developing the Geothermal resources of Lithuania. The loan agreement
would include provisions which allow the Bank, in consultation with the Borrower, to make adjustments
in the details of these items and the schedule for their implementation.
53.             About 20 staff-weeks of effort each year are planned for the first two years and about 15
staff-weeks a year thereafter would be required for supervision. Following the start-up mission,
supervision requirements would include several supervision missions and an annual review; in later years
one supervision mission and an annual review would be conducted. The final supervision mission would
be to prepare the Project completion report. A detailed supervision plan for project implementation is
presented in Chart 2.

E. Accounts and Audits
58.          EG, would prepare semi-annual progress reports on each project component, estimrated
and revised costs, schedule, objective, and activity (starting from Loan Effectiveness). To monitor the
financial performance of EG assurances should be obtained during negotiations that: (a) it will submit not
later than October 31 of each year its operating and capital budget, as well as the budget of the Project
for Bank approval; (b) it will submit on a semi-annual basis financial progress reports in which the sacual
results would be compared with the Budgets; and (c) it will appoint independent auditors satisfactory to
the Bank to audit its accounts, as well as its Project accounts on an annual basis, and the audit reports
will be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year; the audit reports will
contain a separate opinion on compliance with the financial covenants under the Loan.
59.           To monitor project implementation, during negotiations, agreement will be sought that
EG will submit Progress Reports on a quarterly basis and a Implementation Completion Report in
accordance with Bank Guidelines. To gauge progress during the implementation of the Project, a series
of project monitoring indicators were identified during appraisal, and are described in detail in Section
4 below.

B. Procurement Arrangements and Schedule
61.          Like many other Eastern European and FSU countries, Lithuania does not have a tradition
of competitive bidding for the procurement of public goods and services. All procurement during the
Soviet period was done centrally. The GOL is now in the process of preparing legislation instituting
public procurement rules and regulations as part of its comprehensive program to transform its economy
from a centrally planned to a market-oriented system based on the development of a competitive private
sector. The GOL has requested the Bank to provide assistance in this area. A Country Procurement
Assessment Report (CPAR) is not required at this stage. Since the introduction of procurement legislation
is expectod to take some tirne, assurance for this proposed Project was obtained during Appraisal that the
GOL would apply procurement procedures which are consistent with the Bank's 'Guidelines for
Procurement Under IBRD and IDA Credits" (January 1995).
62.          Procurement under parallel cofinancing arrangements (US $2.62 million) would be carried
out through tied procurement in accordance with procurement regulations of the Government of Denmnark,
and the EU-PHARE Program. Procurement would be undertaken in the following manner:
(a)    All contracts funded by the Bank and GEF which are estimated to cost more than
US $250,000 equivalent per contract would be procured following International
Competitive Bidding (ICB). The Borrower would use the Bank's Standard Bidding
Docurnents for Supply and Erect Contracts. Eight contracts totalling US $14.6 million
would be for: (a) drilling operations to establish production and injection wells; (b) well
completion; (c) building and civil works; (d) connection to boiler house and external
piping; (e) absorption heat pump; (f) heat exchangers; (g) filters, valves and internal
piping; and (h) control and regulation equipment, would be awarded under ICB. Such
contracts would include all goods and civil works necessary for component
implementation.
(b)   Packages procured through ICB would account for 100% of the total value of the Bank
Loan and 92.1% of the total value of the GEF grant. Invitations for bids would be
grouped in sizeable bid packages to enhance competition and benefit from economies of
scale in bid prices.
(c)    One contract for consultant services, financed by the GEF, for control and evaluation of
drilling operations (US $0.16 million) would be procured through shortlisting and
competitive selection in accordance with Bank Guidelines for Use of Consultants (August
1981).
Table 13 gives a summnary presentation of procurement arrangements.
63.          Procurement training was provided by the Bank's Procurement Specialist for
represenatives of the MOE, LSPS, KDHE and EG. TENA (the procurement unit of LSPS) would be
involved in the preparation of bidding documents and procurement arrangements, and already has
experience in the preparation of procurement documents in accordance to Bank standards. In addition,
to build up EG's procurement capacity, provision of international technical assistance for Project
implementation provided under the Danish grant should ensure adequate administration of procurement.

64.          Procurement Review. All ICB procurement packages for goods and civil works valued
at US $250,000 or more would be subject to the Bank's prior review and approval, in accordance with
paragraphs 2 and 3 of Appendix 1 of the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. All prior review items would
cover 100% of the total amnount of the loan and the 92.1 % of the GEF grant. The prior review threshold
for consultant services is US $100,000 for firms, and US $50,000 for individuals. Other loan-funded
activities would be subject to the Bank's post review during the supervision of the project, in accordance
with paragraphs 3 and 4 of Appendix 1 of the Guidelines.
65.          All documents related to the GEF financed consulting services as well as the Terms of
Reference (TOR) for Technical Assistance provided under the grants from Denmark and EU-Phare will
require prior review and approval by the Bank.
66.          Procurement Monitoring. Procurement data would be collected and recorded for: (a)
promnpt reporting of contract award information by the Borrower; (b) comprehensive quarterly reports
to the Bank by the Borrower; and (c) revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising,
bidding, contract award, and completion time for individual contracts.
67.          A sumnmary of procurement packages for works, equipment,and technical assistance
indicating the schedule for tendering, the estimated cost and completion time is shown in Table 14.

C. Disbursements
68.          The proposed Project is cxpected to be disbursed over a period of fur (Bank)  c yeas
(1996-1999) with an estimated closing date on December 31, 1998. Disbursemet per year are shown
in Table 15, which shoes the disbursent, per fiscal year, of all the financier's contributions for the
Project. A detailed breakdown for each quarter is given in Table 18. Descriptions of all the Bank loan
and GEF grant proceeds and forecasts of expenditure and disbursenent for the proposed Project are
shown in Table 16. The disbursement schedule is shown in Table 17.

69.          The pace of the disbursement deviate substantially compared to the csen sector
schedules. The implementation of the Project is, however, limited to one investment conponent, where
the underground work has to be carried out in a very short period, whereafter all the necessay above-
ground installation can start. If implemented in a Western country, the Project would easily be finished
within two years. Purthermore, the substantial Technical Assistance (granted by the Govermnent of
Denmark) serves as a guarantee for timely implementation.
70.          The proceeds of the Bank loan and the GEF grant would be disbursed against:
(a)    For goods: 100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of local ex-factory expenditures and
80% of local expenditures for other items procured locally;
(b)    For works: 100% of foreign expenditures and 80% of local expenditures; and
(c)    100% of expenditures for consultancy services and training.
The Danish Ministry of Environment and EU-Phare would manage their own disbursmanents.
71.          Disbursement requests would be prepared and submitted to the Bank by EG. It is
expected that EG would participate in disbursement training organized by the Bank.
72.          Disbursemnent would be made against standard Bank documentation. The domentation
to support these expenditures would be retained by EG for review by Bank supervision missions and
verification by external audits. Disburseent requests would be fully documented except for expenditures
under contruacts for goods and equipment valued at less than US $250,000 equivalent, where staments
of expenditure (SOB) would be used. The mininmm size of the application for direct payment and
issuance of a special commitment is US $100,000 equivalent.



Project Implementanon Plan                                                                    27
72.           To facilitate Project implementation, the Borrower would establish a Special Account in
one of the major foreign commercial banks on termns and conditions satisfactory to the Bank to cover the
Bank's share of expenditures. The authorized allocation would be US $500,000, representing about four
months of average expenditures nade through the Special Account. During the early stages of the
Project, the initial allocation to the Special Account would be limnited to US $230,000. However, when
the aggregate disbursement under Loan has reached the level of US $2,000,000, the initial allocation may
be inoeased to the authorized allocation of US $500,000 by submitting the relevant application for
withdrawal. Applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted montly or when
one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. Documentation requirements for
replenishment would follow the standard Bank procedure as described in the Disbursement Handbook,
Chapter 6. In addition, monthly bank statements of the Special Account which have been reconciled by
the Borrower would accompany all replenishment requests. The terms and conditions of the a,tablishment
and operation of the Special Account would be set forth during negotiations.

D. Loan Covenants for Implementation
74.            Chapter 6 of the Staff Appraisal Report shows a complete list of loan covenants to be
monitored during the Project.



IV. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
A. Actions to Monitor Developnent Objectives
75.          Project monitoring indicators were developed during appraisal in order to enable tracking
of Project inputs on key development objectives throughout the Project cycle. At the mid-tenn review,
the need to fine-tune or restructure the Project design will be based on the data received from these
indicators.
B. Project Indicators
76.          Given the essential role program monitoring and evaluation play in determining the impact
of a given intervention on development objectives, a number of indicators will be used to monitor and
evaluate progress during the implementation of the Klaipeda Geothermal Demonstration Project.
However, the progress of these indicators would be evaluated in relative, not absolute, terms. During
supervision, a selected number of commercial, operational, financial and environmental indicators would
be monitored in accordance with Project objectives.
(a)    Cow7uercial indicators
Extraction of geothermal energy is expected to be larger than described due to
higher temperature in the aquifer, and actions to improve building insulation are
expected to reduce the network return temperature. These deviations will be
continuously monitored and recorded as they will have a clear impact on the sale
of heat.
(b)   Operational indicators
D     Heat extracted from the geothermal water and delivered to the network will be
monitored and compared with actual aquifer temperature and temperature of the
return network water.
*     It should be demonstrated that the use of geothermal energy has resulted in a
reduction of use of imported fossil fuels.
(c)    Financial indicators
The transfer price for geothermal energy between EG and KDHE would be
monitored in accordance with the Loan Agreement.
The following standard financial indicators, in addition to the internal rate of
return, would be monitored:
-     An Operating Ratio (ratio of operating costs to operating revenues,



30                                                                               Annex 1
including depreciation and interest costs, but excluding debt service
payments) not to exceed 85%;
-     A Debt Service Coverage Ratio (the extent to which internal cash
generation covers total debt services) not to fall below 1.5; and
-     A Current Ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) not to fall
below 2.0.
(d)    Environmental Indicators
Operational performance and level of air pollutant reduction achieved by the
geothermal demonstration plant will be recorded as a result of geothermal energy
delivered to KDHE, and based on the actual mix of fuel (natural gas and HFO)
used for heat generation.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED UNDER THE DANISH GRANT






A'.m1.
Technical Assistance Provided Under the Danish Grant
Background
1.           The Danish Environmental Protection Agency has offered parallel financial support for
the implementation of the Klaipeda Geothermal Demonstration Project up to US $2.5 million. The
Danish support has been referred to as the technical assistance component (TAC) under the Kilaipeda
Geothermal Demonstration Project, comprising four major fields of activity. These are:
a)  Project steering, coordination, and supervision of the implementation and start-up of the
demonstration plant;
b)  Engineering and specifications with regard to the aquifer development and surface demonstration
plant;
c)  Procurement and contracting with regard to required goods and services; and
d)  Training of Lithuanian State Power System and Enterprise Geoterma staff for the purpose of
sustainable operation and maintenance of the demonstration plant.
An important goal under the Danish Project support is to provide the TAC in a manner which allows
continued geothermal development in Lithuania,
both in Klaipeda as well as other urban areas in
western Lithuania.   This requires detailed
documentation and thorough reporting procedures
in step with plant development.

DONG will be assisted by two sub-contrcted     Wde. consructon            s.ufate -
companies, Petroleum Geology Investigators and
Houe & Olsen (see Box 1).
Scope of Work
3.           The implementation and start-up
phase of the Kilapoda Geothermal Development Plant is expected to take three years subsequent to the
Bank's approval of the Project. The Danish project support consists of approximately 25,600 man-hours



2
of work, including Danish on-site supervision with regard to the drilling, testing, and completion of the
geothermal wells as well as for the construction and installation of the geothermal surface plants. The
various work tasks and activities are summarized as follows:
*   Agreements
*   Main plant design
*   Drilling, testing, and completion of wells;
*   Approvals, including environmental and safety aspects;
*   Design/technical specifications;
- Mechanical
- Electricity and control
- water and sewage
- district heating connection
- pipeline between wells
- building
*   Bidding, purchase and contract documentation;
*   QA, QC, and follow-up on construction;
*   Training of operating personnel at Thisted geothermal plant (Denmark);
*   Hook-up, test, and commissioning;
o   Assistance during start-up; and
*   Assistance during production.
4.           Project -tei   an  Coordination.  Danish project steering, coordination, and
participation in the project implementation are assumed as mandatory requirements for the Danish project
support.
5.           The project steering comprises management of the Danish project group in addition to
the advisory function to be provided to the Lithuanian Owner/Operator (Enterprise Geoterma) with a view
to a time and cost effective operation.
6.           The project manager will ensure effective liaison between the Lithuanian/Danish project
groups and the parties providing financing to the project, and will coordinate the project with other
related activities of technical/economic interest that could improve the geothermal heat generation. The
total manpower requirement with regard to project steering and coordination is estimated at 5,600 man-
hours.
7.           On-site supervision by the Danish consultants on behalf of the Operator is planned both



3
with regard to the drilling, testing, and completion of the geothernal wells as well as for the construction
and installation activities required for the implementation of the geothermal production and injection
plants.
8.           Reporting. Adequate documentation with regard to the progress of the project is
considered a basic requirement for proper steering and coordination of the project. It is of particular
importance for project sustainability and continued geothermal development elsewhere in Lithuania. IN

addition to routinely prepared and issued monthly progress reports, a number of completion reports (well
completion, construction, and installation) as well as a final project implementation report are required.
Based on a manpower requirement of 70 man-hours per month for documentation/reporting activities,
the total project support for this component is assessed at 2,000 mnan-hours.
9.           The manpower requirement under the Danish financial support for the implementation
of the Klaipeda Geothermal Demonstration Project is summarized in Table 1, allocated to work category
and year of activity.
10.          Supervision OA/OC. Based on the Lithuanian estimate with regard to the implementation
of the geothermal wells, a total manpower requirement for full-time on-site supervision is estimated at
1600 man-hours. The on-site supervision with regard to construction and installation of the geothermal
plants is planned to extend over approximately 18 months and require 4,000 man-hours of work,
including the installation and tuning of the absorption heat pumps. The engineering department in DONG
is ISO 90001 certified and relevant QA/QC procedures will be applied to the project.
11.          Engineering. The detailed engineering and specifications present the most time consuming
activity under the Danish project support and comprise 8,000 man-hours that can be divided into two
parts:
a)  The preparation of the drilling, testing, and completion programs for the two geothermal
production wells, the single injection well, and the specifications required for the procurement
of pertinent equipment, services, and consumables. The drilling operations are currently planned



4
to take place with mixed Lithuanian/Western equipment, services, and consumables. Including
aquifer formation, evaluation of this work is estimated to take 1,700 man-hours to complete.
b)  A total of 7,100 man-hours is estimated with regard to the performance of the program
engineering and specifications required for the construction, installation, and start-up of the
geothermal plant, i.e., including man-hours for technical support (drafting, computer processing,
and analysis, etc).
12.          Procurement. Assuming single stage procurement with regard to all the above items, it
is estimated that it would require a total of approximately 2,000 man-hours of work to assist Enterprise
Geoterma to prepare, issue, review, and negotiate the final contracts with the pertinent bidders.
13.          Training and Education. The work activities described above will be closely coordinated
with the Lithuanian Operator. Hence a large portion with regard to the transfer of methodology and
knowledge will be on-the-job training. In this context, training and education will be an important
component in conjunction with the planned procurement of Western goods and services under the project.
The training and education provided by the contractors will also include in-house courses, workshops,
and small seminars. Such educational activity is more or less standard procedure among the contractor
companies considered for participation in the project.
14.          An important part of the training and education component comprises the on-the-job
training and education for operation and maintenance of the geothermal plant. The operation of the
absorption heat pumps is a finely tuned operation and requires well-trained and dedicated personnel. This
part of the training component will be initiated at the Thisted Geothermal Plant in Denmark and will be
followed up with the start up of the Klaipeda Geothermal plant. Based on the allocation of two Danish
engineers during six months for training purposes, it is estimated that this component would require 1,600
man-hours of Danish project support.
15.           The training and education will be given with a view to make it possible for Enterprise
Geoterma to operate the demonstration plant and erect more geothermal plants in Lithuania. The Danish
consultancy assistance will thus include training of personnel within Enterprise Geoterma concerning
planning, erection, and operation of a geothermal plant.
16.          The training for the planning and erection of the plant will primarily be implemented
through joint work during the design, specification, procurement, and supervision phases, but it will also
include some training in the use of a Western computer aided design tool such as Autocad (Autocad LT
is expected to be given to Enterprise Geoterma as part of the technology transfer).
17.          The operating training will primarily include training at the Thisted Geothermal
Demonstration Plant with courses and participation on the daily operation of the plant. The opening
training will also include assistance with the writing of an operations manual and assistance in the
operation of the Klaipeda Geothermal Demonstration Plant during the start up phase.
18.          Goals and Expected Results. The goal of Danish support is to assist Enterprise Geoterma
with the successful planning, erection, start-up, and operation of the Klaipeda Geothermal Demonstration
Plant. A further goal is to make it possible for Enterprise Geoterma to erect more geothermal plants in
Lithuania with greater Lithuanian participation.
The assistance from the Danish project group to Enterprise Geoterma and the experience



5
gained through the Klaipeda Geothermal Demonstration Project, together with the training and education
planned for the Project, is expected to make it possible for Enterprise Geoterma to:
a)  Erect the Klaipeda Geothermal Demonstration Plant successfully;
b)  Avoid start-up problems;
c)  Avoid operation problems such as sand production, pump break downs, corrosion, loss of
injectivity, and down time;
d)  Obtain an optimized operation of the plant with a maximized geothermal heat production;
e)  Plan, design, erect, and operate new geothermal plants with higher Lithuanian content and
participation; and
f)   Eventually participate in geothermal projects outside Lithuania.

Assumptions underbying the Financoia Projectionst
A. Baskgwmd
1.    Until recently, the present activities of Enterprise Geoterma (EG) were carried out by a
unit of LPC. As such, EG has no financial record. EG recently submitted its opening balance
sheet (as of ... ), which has been confirmed by the head of finance at LPC. As the opening
balance sheet indicates, EG has only one material asset, two wells at Vidmantai, which await
development. EG intends to make use of this asset in the future, probably after the completion of
the Klaipeda Project. These wells have been valued at 2.7 million LT (US$0.7 million). These
wells will also constitute the contribution of LPC towards the capital of EG. The balance of the
capital will be paid by the Govenmient which will provide its own funds, as well as those of
other donors. Thus, the equity of the Government in EG will gradually increase.
2.    The projections are expressed in current LT, at the constant exchange rate of US$1 = 4.00
LT. Local inflation was estimated as follows:

Subject to procurement constraints, the GEF grant will be disbursed prior to the IBRD loan. The
IBRD loan will be onlent by the Government to EG on the same terms, i.e. over 20 years
including a 5 year grace period. The loan amount includes a provision to finance interest during
construction over 1996-99.
4.   In addition, the Government of Lithuania will provide a grant of $0.3 million (LT. 1.3
million) toward the financing of EG's operating expenses during the period 1996-98.
C. Income Statements
5.    Sales of heat were assumed to begin in 1999, at a constant level equivalent to 127
Gcal/year (530 GJ per year), at a price equivalent to US$100/ton, with an heat rate (taking into
account boiler efficiency) of 0.1289 ton/Gcal (which is broadly consistent with historical
records); this turns out to be LT 51.56/Gcal (US$3.08/GJ).
6.    The operating expenses of EG during the construction period were derived from the
detailed business plan of EG prepared with the assistance of external consultants. Sailaries and
wa=es are provided for 7 staff, and include a contribution to social funds.
7.    Con£Ilinj erves are mostly for legal expenses, as well as interpreters. Overheads
include provisions for Board attendance, office expenses, utilities, insurance and travel.

8.    The Operating Costs of the gothermalln pnt were derived from engineering estimates
and confirmed by EG. The cost of elerici1v was derived from a consumption estimated at 9,350
MWh per annum, at an average tariff of US,3.5 /kWh (LT 0.14/kWh).  Sries an d   for
plant operators were estimated at LT 300,000 in 1999 and subsequently increased with inflation.
(                      expenses in 1999 were estimated on the basis of plant value; a
provision for insurance is also included in this category. The provisions for Direct Taxs reflect
the interpretation by EG of the Law on Immovable property and are particularly onerous. 1

ANNEX 1.4 Project Economic Analysis
Main Assumptions
All costs and benefits are valued in constant 1994 US $.
As no market for long-term capital exists in Lithuania, a real discount rate of 10% has been
assumed for NPV and switching value calculations
Useful heat extraction (base case): 530 Terajoules/year
Substitute fuel prices
Natural gas                    US $90/thousand cubic meters
Mazut (3%  S)                  US $100/ton (delivered to Klaipeda storage facilities)
Boiler Efficiency (fossil fuels):      85%
Additional handling charges
Natural gas                    None (price assumes delivery to existing boilers)

Geothermal energy is natural heat, stored in mobile fluids present in geological strata, at
temperature above the annual average values. Low temperature geothermal energy, below 100
degree Celsius '°C', is widespread all over the world and is exploited for district heating,
agricultural and industrial use by extracting the heat from the subsurface fluids. The development
of such energy is generally connected to several factors: geologic and thermal conditions, climate,
industrial and technological development etc.
Low temperature geothermal energy technology is well proven and is operational in several
European countries: Iceland; Sweden; Denmark; France; Italy; CIS etc. for a variety of uses but
essentially district heating and agriculture. When used for residential or district heating systems,
the geothermal source substitute basically for the fuel in the conventional system. Heat is generally
extracted from the geothermal water by heat exchangers, but higher efficiency heat pumps become
essential for low temperature source to allow recovery of sufficient amount of heat from the
geothermal fluid. Development of low temperature geothermal projects is strictly dependent on
the proximity of end-users, because long distance transportation is not economical as heat losses
and insulation costs would render the project uneconomical. When converting a heating system to
geothermal, the additional costs needed are represented by drilling of production and disposal wells
to re-inject spent water, heat exchangers and pumps, and modifications to the distribution net work
which are often necessary.
The proposed project consists of a pilot 'demonstration' plant representing the first phase
in the development of relatively extensive geothermal resources for space heating in Klaipeda and
other urban areas in Lithuania. It represents an important pilot phase in the more general Power
and Heating Rehabilitation Project with an objective to: establish the feasibility and economic
viability of exploiting geothermal resources for district heating; reduce the dependence on imported
fossil fuels for power generation and heating; and contribute to the mitigation of the environmental
impact of carbon, sulfur and nitrogen oxides emissions.
RESOURCE ASSESSMENT
In Lithuania, geothermal potential is confined to the Cambrian and Lower Devonian which
underlie most of the Lithuanian and Latvian territories, at depth ranging from 2000 to 900 meters.
In the Klaipeda area, the above aquifers are encountered at depth of 2000 and 1200 meters



for the present development.
Geothermal resource evaluation was undertaken by an independent consultant (Petroleum
Geology Investigators "PGI" of Denmark), in collaboration with the Danish Geological Survey,
on the basis of data collected from some 60 wells drilled to explore for hydrocarbons in Lithuania.
The estimates were made using volumetric calculations in accordance with procedures approved
by the commission of European Communities for the transformation of hydro-geothermal data into
energy resources. Estimates for Lithuania indicate a heat resource potnial from the Cambrian and
Lower Devonian of some 345 Exa Joules 'EJ' (10's Joules), equivalent to 96 trillion Kwh,
assuming a heat extraction down to a temperature of 15 IC. In terms of fossil fuel, the above
potential corresponds to about 8600 million TOE1.
In Klaipeda area, the economic geothermal heat resources are estimated at about 1460 peta
Joules (PJ= 10' J), based on a resource area extending 2 kn beyond current city limits, and an
average aquifer temperature of 42 IC. Assuming that a fraction equivalent to 30% of the heat
would be extracted for the district heating net work, the geothermal resources available at Klipeda
are estimated at about 440 PJ. Such heat reserves would sustain some 80 years of heat supply based
on a total annual heat demand in Klaipeda of 5.6 PJ. The proposed demonstration project is
designed to cover of about 10% of the current heat demand in Klaipeda, 0.53 PJ per annum,
equivalent to 1.43x105 MWh. The main parameters considered in the above estimates are
summarized in the table below:

The main geothermal aquifer zone in Klaipeda is situated in the Lower Devonian Formation
at an average depth of about 1250 below ground level (GL). The zone is subdivided into two nain
units: Dlikn and Dlgr, each composed of series of sand horizons, predominany fluvio-deltaic to
shallow marine in origin. The cumulative gross thickness of aquifer sands in the Klaipeda area is
about 250 meters and the net sand thickness is about 140 meters. The aquifer sands are generally
characterized by favorable petrophysical properties and are very prolific: sand porosity ranges from
15 to 30%; and permeability ranges from 0.5 to 3.2 Darcies.

The aquifer water is neutral and contains about 96 gram per liter of salt (sea water contains
35 gram per liter), mainly of sodium chloride. The presence of hydrogen sulfide (112S) has never
been detected while drilling into the geothermal zone or from water samples obtained from the
Devonian aquifers in wells drilled in Lithuania. The average composition of the geothermal water

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project consists of recovering heat from hot water produced from the Lower Devonian
aquifer sands. The water is then circulated through a closed loop in a doublet, production-injection
well, configuration comprising heat absorption pumps and heat exchangers to extract a fraction of
the heat carried by the geothermal water. The heat recovered is then injected into the existing
district heating network in Klaipeda. In essence, the geothermal loop replaces part of the boiler
function in the conventional district heating systern.
The project comprises two main components: development and construction of the
geothermal loop mentioned above, which entails the drilling of three wells and the construction of
heat recovery facilities; and training and technical assistance to guarantee a smooth and timely
project implementation, and technical transfer to facilitate the future development of the Lithuanian
geothermal resources. The loop is designed based on the same concept used at the Thisted
geothermal plant in Denmark which is now in operation since 1984. This design has been chosen
because of the close similarities of aquifer parameters (petrophysical properties, depth and water
temperature) at Klaipeda and Thisted.



Geothermal Loop
The geothermal loop entails the following components:
Driling - A total of three wells will be drilled under the project: two production wells to
supply some 600 m3/ hour; and one re-injection well to circulate the cooled water back to the same
aquifer. The wells will be completed with 90' inch production casing and would be equipped with
a submersible centrifugal electric pumps having a capacity of 0.27 MW each capable of delivering
some 300 m3 per hour. The two production wells will be drilled with a distance of about 200
meters between them. The wells would be deviated from the vertical in order to attain a horizontal
departure, at the aquifer level, of about 400 to 500 meters. This would maximize the area drained
by each well resulting into higher well production capacity. In addition, drilling the two wells from
the same surface location minimizes surface piping which would reduce cost and heat losses.
The re-injection well will be drilled in an inverted line drive configuration relative to the
production wells at equal distance of 800 to 1000 m from the production wells, at the main aquifer
level. Such spacing between the injector and producers is required in order to delay the arrival of
the re-injected cooled water into the production wells and to allow longer time for the water to be
reheated in contact with the reservoir rock. The re-injection well will be equipped with a surface
pump of sufficient capacity to re-inject all the cooled water back into the same aquifer zone.
Heat Recovery Facilities: Heat is extracted from the geothermal water using an absorption
heat pump and heat exchangers. The configuration of the heat absorption pump comprises an
evaporator, an absorber, a condenser, a working fluid regenerator, and heat exchangers. The pump
uses lithium bromide (LiBr) solution as the heat absorbent working fluid. The aquifer water from
which heat is to be recovered, is caused to flow through an evaporator, while the hot water utilized
for district heating is circulated separately in the absorber and condenser, which would transfer the
heat extracted from the geothermal water to the district heating system.
The absorption heat pump is driven by 150-160 OC hot water from a boiler, which is part
of the district heating system. The heat supplied by the boiler to operate the pump would then be
transferred to the district heating network together with the extracted geothermal heat. The
absorption heat pump used in the project is characterized by very small power consumption and
operating cost.
The geothermal loop is designed using corrosion resistant materials for piping, welding and
valves. The piping material is made of diffusion proof carbon steel and the valve installed are air
proof. The geothermal water circulated into the system will be pre-filtered to avoid deposition of
scale. The loop will be operated at over-pressure to eliminate the entry of oxygen from the air into
the system. Over-pressure in the loop will be maintained during stoppage using pressured nitrogen
cylinders. The above design concept, together with very low CO2 content and H2S free geothermal
brine, is expected to lead to a corrosion rate of less than 0.1 mm/year. The experience gained,
during the past decade, from the Geothermal Demonstration plant at Thisted in Denmark has
proved the above design to be reliable and cost effective.
The main components and the general layout of the geothermal loop for the Klaipeda
geothermal demonstration plant are shown schematically in the figure below.

Environmental Review
A. Overview
1.            Introduction. Preparation of the proposed Project has included an environmental review
consistent with the applicable procedures of the GOL and the provisions of World Bank Operational
Directive 4.01, "Environmental Assessment" for a category "B" project. As the Project would not
generate waste or any emissions to either air or water, the review has been based on information about
environmental benefits as a result of reduced consumption of fossil fuels.
2.            Consultation process. The environmental review for the proposed project was prepared
in coordination with Enterprise Geoterma (EG). EG will obtain the routine approvals for construction
of the geothermal plant, including approvals from the local electricity company and the water and sewage
company. Geotermia is in the process of requesting a formal environmental impact clearance. Upon
completion, the Ministry of the Environment will then check whether impacts are correctly assessed, and
whether mitigation measures are adequate. Finally, the Ministry of Construction and Urbanistics will
issue the permission to start construction once all approvals are in place.
B. Current Environmental Conditions In Klaipeda'
3.            Environmental quality problems are not as severe in Lithuania as those encountered in
other countries of the FSU and eastern Europe. The decline in economic activity over the past five years
has corresponded with a drop in industrial activity and energy use, resulting in an overall decline in
pollution. However, in smaller cities dominated by a single large manufacturing facility, emissions from
these plants are still high enough to result in adverse health impacts. This is, for example, true of
Jonava, where a significantly higher incidence of children's respiratory disease and eye disease has been
reported. 2
4.            However, it appears that the concentration of most pollutants has dropped, with the
exception of NO2, which has risen in almost all cities since 1991. This can be attributed to an increase
in vehicular emissions, which is estimated to cause 70% of air pollution in cities (Lithuania Ministry of
Environment).
5.            Klaipeda's main pollution problem in previous years was caused by an industrial plant
that produced batteries. This has been temporarily closed down, due to limitations placed on industrial
output. Today whatever air pollution problems exist are principally caused by traffic congestion in the
I      Water pollutio is no discussed, as it is irrelevant to the use of geothermal eergy in this case.

older parts of the city. Many district heating substations in the city center are old and inefficient, which
exacerbates the situation.
6.            According to Ministry of Environment figures for Klaipeda (1993), the average
concentration of main pollutants in Klaipeda was low and did not reach the Highest Permitted
Concentration (HPC). However, the accuracy of these figures cannot be independently verified. The
average concentration of sulfur dioxide was 0.005 mg/rn3 and the maximum concentration was 0.123
mg/m3. (This does not exceed WHO guidelines of 125 micrograms per cubic meter.) Concentrations
showed no increase over 1992. Concentrations were higher in winter, which can be attributed to
increased use of electricity and heating. The average concentration of NO2 in the town center and the
industrial site was 0.03 mg/m3. The maximum amount of NO2 was registered in the town center (because
of intensive traffic) and reached 0.32 mg/n3, which is 3.8 times higher than HPC. Throughout the rest
of the town, the maximum concentration ranged from 0.15 to 0.20 mg/r3, 1.8 to 2.4 times HPC. (The
WHO does not issue an annual guideline, but the EU annual limit value for nitrogen dioxide is 200
micrograms per cubic meter, which is clearly exceeded in Klaipeda for much of the time). The average
contribution of CO2 was 1 mg/r3. The concentration of CO2 only exceeded HPC once in 1993, when
it reached 7 mg/m3. Klaipeda compared favorably with other regions of Lithuania, in terms of both
average and maximum concentrations of sulfur dioxide and CO2. However, it recorded the highest
maximum concentrations of NO2 in 1992 and 1993. Information on PM,O was not available.
Health Impacts
7.            According to the best available scientific evidence, most health damage from exposure
to sulfur dioxide is caused by brief exposures to high ambient concentrations, as opposed to long term
exposure to low average concentrations. Therefore, the maximum concentrations observed in Klaipeda,
and the higher level concentration in winter poses a health hazard.
8.            Recent epidemiological surveys performed in the United States have established a linkage
between excess mortality and exposures to low levels of PMIO. and for sulfate particles (formed from
sulfur dioxide).3 These studies appear to indicate that that there may be no safe threshold levels below
which health damage does not occur, and that health effects have a linear relation to ambient
concentrations. Other studies have demonstrated similar linkages. Ostro (1994)4, reviewed studies of
premature mortality, finding an average effect of 0.96 percent increase in mortality per 10 micrograms
per cubic meter of PMIo. Ostro also reviews studies that detail the observation of effects of sulfur dioxide
on the respiratory system within short term exposures.
9.            The epidemiological effects of nitrogen dioxide are more uncertain, and are primarily
linked to exposure of children to indoor gas stoves. Effects from outdoor nitrogen dioxide have not been
established (Ostro 1994).

10.          Rerglations. Every industrial enterprise, utility, and heating company must request an
emission permit, for which there is no charge. The permit is issued by the regional Department of the
Environment. If the permitted amount of emnissions is exceeded, in terms of tons/year, a fine is imposed
(collection rates are unavailable). The fines differ according to substance, and are indexed to inflation
four times a year. Pemnitted concentrations of pollutants are determined according to the State Control
Regulations on Stationary Sources of Air Pollution, issued by the Ministry of Environment in 1992, in
accordance with Order 97. New HPC standards will be issued on January 1, 1996, and will be applied
to all new and rehabilitated boilers. In cases where boilers use two or more different kinds of fuel,
standards for complex pollutant emissions will be higher.
C. Project Description
11.          The proposed Project will be developed as an environmental/energy management project
for the city of Klaipeda. The Project has two components:
(i)    Technical Assistance and Training Component:
-     design of the geothermal loop including all necessary equipment for extracting
the heat from the geothermal water and transferring it to the district heating
system;
-     preparation of detailed drilling, testing and completion programs;
*     management support to the Project implementation for Enterprise Geoterma,
including support to LSPS/TENA in the preparation of tender documents;
*     training of Lithuanian staff and management in operation of the geothermal plant
in Thisted, Denmark to maximize the transfer of technology; and
*     supervision of the implementation of the project including installation of the
geothermal loop as well as underground work.
(ii)   Investment Component:
*     establishment of two production wells and one injection well;
*     above ground facilities including building and necessary equipment such as
absorption heat pumps, heat exchanger, and auxiliary equipment for control and
regulation of the plant and the heat transfer to the district heating system; and
*     piping between production wells and geothermal plant, as well as piping from the
geothennal plant to the injection well, and piping between the geothermal plant
and the district heating network.

D. Environmental Impacts
12.          The Project has overwhelmingly positive environmental impacts.  The negative
environmental impact occasioned is minimal: the disposal of residues (drilling mud, formation water and
diesel) from drilling operations during implementation. Risks associated with the production of CO2 or
H2s (hydrogen sulfide) are very low as the resource is of a sedimentary origin. Contamination of the
aquifer with sulfate-reducing bacteria is very unlikely because the production and re-injection of water
is carried out via a closed loop, which is designed to eliminate the entry of oxygen and bacterial
contamination. H2S or acid fluids are generally encountered in geothermal systems associated with
volcanic activities. Other risks such as subsidence of the overlying terrain are virtually non-existent -
because all water produced is re-injected into the aquifer to maintain the formation pressure at its original
value.
13.         Implementation of the KGDP would result in improvement of ambient air quality through
annual reductions in emissions of CO2 and NO, to the amount of 47,800 and 310 tons respectively based
on replacement of natural gas, and 51,900 and 265 tons respectively if HFO is replaced. In addition the
replacement of HFO would result in an additional reduction of S02 of about 1160 tons per year.
14.          The economic benefits of reducing C02, NO, and SO2 emissions have been calculated on
the basis of mitigation costs and are valued as follows:
Carbon Dioide Mitigation: An economic value of US $7/ton of CO2 (US $25/ton of carbon)
reduction has been assumed based on values employed in other similar projects. It is indicative
of the level of GEF grant financing possible for greenhouse gas reduction projects. Pending any
regional environmental cooperation agreement between Lithuania and Western Europe, and
rationalization of carbon taxes in Europe, the economnic value of CO2 mnitigation to the Lithuanian
economy is assumed to be equal to the level of grant funding that has been made available for
CO2 mitigation. Carbon (C) emissions from natural gas are estimated at 19.45 kg/GJ.
NO. Migation: Marginal abatement costs, estimated at around US $250/ton of NO,, are used
as a proxy for mitigation benefits. Abatement costs typically range from US $250 to US $1000
per ton of NO, removed in other parts of the world depending on the baseline level of NO.
emissions, capacity factors, fuel, and capital investment required. Since Lithuania's present
emissions (baseline) are relatively high, low cost technologies (low temperature burner nozzles,
air control monitors, etc.) can be employed to significantly reduce emission levels. NOx
emissions from natural gas combustion are low and estimated at 0.0001 kgs/GJ.
Sulfur Dioxide Mitlgation: An economic value of $600 per ton of sulfur dioxide has been
assumed, and is derived from the range of values estimated in damage studies performed in
industrialized and developing countries. This estimate has been employed based on values
calculated for Poland, a country with similar geographic, environmental, and economic
conditions.
15.          Lithuania is a signatory of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC), and as such has demonstrated a willingness to support projects resulting in greenhouse g3s
reduction. Moreover, an anticipatory approach towards the possible adoption of a carbon tax by the



- v -
European Union will facilitate Lithuania's adjustment to the added costs of such a tax, were Lithuania
to join the EU.
16.          Both from  the perspectives of limiting health damage, and from  assumed public
willingness to comply with future environmental policy, the proposed geothermal project would have
beneficial local results. In order to fully assess the benefits in reduced health damage, data for PM1O, and
information on health and labor costs is necessary. However, it is clear that given high short term
concentrations of sulfur dioxide, the reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions (in the case of mazut
replacement) could only be benign. Given the tighter standards to be enforced in 1996, and a possible
stricter enforcement of the prohibition of the use of mazut with a Sulfur content greater than 2.5%, the
use of geothermal energy would make it easier for KDHE to meet standards.
E. Proposed Mitigation Actions
17.          Protection of drinking water zones. The consultants have estimated the salinity of the
geothermal water in Klaipeda to be 8.8% by weight. Therefore, it is important that the water does not
flood farm land or enter groundwater. The use of a closed loop system will avoid such leakages.
Geothermal water which is used to clean up the pipe system prior to re-injection will lead to the sea
through the sewer system. Drinking water zones will be protected by a cement casing. Basins and pits
on the well site will be sealed off, and measures will be taken to avoid residue spills during testing and
production. Solid wastes from the drilling operation will be deposited in suitable controlled landfills.
18.          Blow out prevention. The likelihood of gas or oil presence in the Devonian aquifer zone
is considered very small. Nevertheless, the casing and cementing programs are designed to resist a blow-
out from the Devonian aquifer.
19.          Prevention of gas release. If necessary, measures will be taken to prevent gases from
being released from geothermal water in the sewer. Water destined for the sewer will first be sprayed
into a basin in which it slowly runs towards the inlet pipe of the sewer system, in order to release
combustible gases, if present. The absorption heat pump does not utilize CFC gas, but a LiBr-water
solution, and therefore does not lead to gas leakage to the atmosphere.
F. Enviromnental Monitoring and Institutional Issues
20.           Discussions have been held between the consultants and the Lithuanian Geological Survey,
the Lithuanian Energy Agency and the Ministry of the Environment. The Geological Survey expressed
its support for the project, and offered assistance as required. The Survey provides government
supervision with regard to the exploitation of Lithuanian underground resources. Pending the receipt of
an orderly drilling proposal, the Survey will be able to provide clearance within a month. The Ministry
of the Environment provides government supervision with regard to an environmentally acceptable
drilling operation. The Ministry has expressed concern that installation of the wellhead be adequately
performed. It has also stressed that measures be taken to prevent gas entering the sewage system. These
concerns have been addressed, and follow-up will be closely monitored.
