Borrower            The Republic of Nigeria
Implementing Agency Ministry of Finance
Financing Data      IDA Credit of SDR 323 million (US$ 500 million equivalent)
Operation Type      Development Policy Operation
Main Policy Areas   The main policy areas supported by the DPO are: (a) maintaining
                    confidence and stability of the banking system, and (b) sustaining
                    growththrough soundmacroeconomicpolicies and budget priorities
Key Outconle        The followingoutcomes are expectedas a result ofthe proposed operation:
Indicators              Banking system liquidity is restored and increased confidence allows
                        normal functioning of the interbank markets for Naira and foreign
                        exchange.Government debt markets functionmore efficientlyand become
                        more liquid. (Use of the extended window facility declines from W 480
                        billiodday to below W 200 billiodday; parallel market USD exchange rate
                        fallsto within 10%of the interbank rate).
                        The banking system becomes more sound and transparent. (Capital
                        adequacy ratios remain above 15 percent through 2009. Improved
                        reporting and accounting encourages investment in bank debt & equity,
                        and better pricing for debt issuances by banks on international markets.
                        Banks' ability to manage risk improved by access new sources of credit
                        information).
                        Federal government expenditure in 2009 remains within a range of 23-25
                        percent of non-oil GDP (21.2 in 2008,25.4 in 2007,21.4 in 2006).
                        Execution rate of the federal capital budget (in percent of the 2009 budget
                        as finally approved by the National Assembly) rises from 53.9 percent in
                        2008 to morethan 60 percent in 2009.
                        Non-oil revenue collected at the federal level (as percentage of non-oil
                        GDP) increasesfiom 8.6% in 2008 to 9% in 2009.
                        Month-end financial statements produced by 75 percent of federal
                        government MDAYswithin 7 days. (Baseline: formerly no automated
                        statements).
                        65% of Federal Government contracts using national standard bidding
                        documents. 95% of Federal Government contract awards above W 75
                        million are published.
Program             In respondingto the on-going global financialcrisisthe proposed credit
Development         is intended to provide budgetary support to the Federal Government of
Objective(s) and    Nigeria to offset the fiscal impact of the crisis and support the
Contribution to CAS Government in maintaining its current economic reform path in the
                    financial sector, fiscal policy, management and governance. The three
                    program objectives are: (i) maintaining confidence and stability in the
                    Financial System; (ii) strengthening the Banking System; and (iii)
                    supporting the objectives of the 2009 budget focused on raising
                    Governmentinvestment spendingto acceleratenon-oil growth.

I Risksand Risk    1The main risks associated with the operation, which the measures        I
I Mitigation       1supportedby the operationalso seekto &tigate, are:                      I
                       Governance risk: Nigeria is a country that faces governance
                       challenges. The Credit includes prior actions to strengthen
                       transparency as regards the financial sector and public financial
                       management.
                       ~olitiialsupport:Government is strongly committedto takingtough
                       decisions in supporting of a program of ambitious reforms despite
                       the context of a global financial crisis and severe economic
                       downturn. The letter of development policy signals the authorities'
                       commitment to policy reform and a strong communications
                       strategy.
                       Economic risks: On the external side, a firher reduction in oil
                       prices and the continued reduction in foreign remittances coupled
                       with a M e r deteriorationin the world economy and international
                       financialmarkets could seriouslyimpact economic circumstancesin
                       Nigeria. The authorities are monitoring the situation closely and
                       Nigeriahas as yet managedto withstand a seriousexternalshock.
                       Financial sector risks: GivenNigeria's current accountingstandards
                       and the continued worldwide pressure on international financial
                       markets, efforts to shore up the Nigerian banking sector might not
                       be sufficient. The Credit includes prior actions to nitigate against
                       this risk and supports a medium t&      program of financial sector
                       reforms.
                       Security issues: There is a risk of deterioration in the security and
                       law and order situation,which could shiR Government's focus from
                       economic matters. While this risk cannot be directly mitigated, the
                       Governmentis committedto improved security,as confiied by the
                       renewed efforts to end militancy in the Delta. The Governmenthas
                       also showed its commitment in this area by the recent creation of a
                       ministry for the Niger Delta, and a significant increase in budgetary
                       allocations.

1.      Oil plays a dominantrole in the Nigerian economy accounting for over 95 percent of exports
and nearly 81percent of Government revenues.' In the wake of the global financial crisis, oil prices
fell from a peak of US$ 147hbl to around US$ 40hbl. before recovering to about US$ 60hbl in
March 2009. This situation presents tremendous macroeconomic challenges for Nigeria. At current
prices and production rates Government revenues will be dramatically smaller in 2009 than in
previous years. Although oil revenue has been managed carefully over the past years with
Governmentbuilding up savings in the excess crude account, falling oil prices, productionproblems,
and the deteriorating fiscal outlook have reduced international confidence. Also, large portfolio
outflows that had begun at the beginning of 2008 and triggered a decline in the stock market further
accelerated in the wake of the global financial crisis. The smaller oil revenue inflows and weakening
confidence with concomitant lower net capital inflows have put increasing pressure on the Naira,
M e r deterring investments.Net capital outflows have also impacted the stock market, which has
fallen dramatically since the beginning of 2008. In combination, these factors led to liquidity
pressures within the banking system in late 2008 and the first months of 2009. WhileNigerian banks
continue to be well-capitalized, declining economic growth, coupled with the banks' lending to the
oil industry and its suppliersand exposureto the stockmarket, is putting pressure on bank earnings.

2.      Ahead of the internationalfinancial crisis,Nigeria's economy experienceda sustained growth
spurt. Since 2001, Nigeria's growth of the non-oil economy acceleratedto more than 8 percent. This
growth performance was made possible by a combination of sound macroeconomic management,
notably the introduction of an oil-price based fiscal rule, with economic and governance reforms.
Increased agricultural production played a key role in the expansion of the non-oil economy as
previously pent-up domestic demand increased prices for food products and led to increased land
under cultivation. As a result, incomes rose
significantlyin rural and urban areas duringthis time.
                                                                      Figure 1: Growth Projections

3.      The international financial crisis is now
bringing this growth episode to an end. Non-oil
growth projections have been revised substantially
downwards from 6.8 to 3 percent in 2009 and 2010
(see Figure 1). Compounded by the decline in oil
output, overall growth in 2009 and 2010 is expected
to fall to 2.9 and 2.6 percent respectively, down
from 5.3 percent in 2008. The decline in oil prices
and the resulting sharp drop in oil revenue is also
creating fiscal pressures. The oversall fiscal balance
of the consolidated Government is projected to turn


1Source: Based on the 2008 UNCTAD data, the most highly concentrated export structure in the world."

from a surplus of 5 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2008 to a deficit of about 8
percent of GDP in 2009. The consequent increase in financing requirements will increase
pressures on the domestic capital markets. Despite the achievement in economic management
since 2001, the economy is thereforeseverely affectedby the crisis.

4.      The proposed Development Policy Credit (DPC) would support the Government's efforts to
maintain its current reform path and limit the crisis impact on the non-oil economy. The policy
actions supported by the credit aim at sustaining a stable and sound financial sector, maintaining
sound management of oil revenues, refocusing budgetary expenditures on investments addressing
growth bottlenecks for the economy, and continuing reform efforts in the area of public financial
management. In particular, the monetary authorities have taken aggressive measures to provide
sufficientliquidityto the banking system, and advanced measures to tightenbank oversightas part of
a medium-term financial sector reform program. The Government has approved a 2009 budget that
uses a conservative oil price, reprioritizes spending toward capital outlays, and taken measures to
accelerate execution of capital spending. At the same time, reforms continue in improving
transparency and accountability, and ensuring value for money in procurement. Going fonvard the
credit identifies a set of medium term actions required to support implementation of the identified
structural reforms, see attached matrix in Annex 2. These relate to both strengtheningthe financial
sector, macroeconomic management and public financial management and procurement. These
actions4iscussed and endorsed by the authorities-lend           themselves to monitoring. Their
realization will be crucial to maintaining the momentum for reform supported by this credit and to
achievingthe envisaged structuraloutcomes.

5.      The DPC is closely aligned with the Government's overall medium-term reform agenda
and the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The Government outlined its program in the 7-point
agenda, which is based on the Nigeria Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy
(NEEDS). The seven focus areas are: (i) critical infrastructure (particularly electricity and
transport) ; (ii) Niger Delta regional development; (iii) food security; (iv) human capital
development; (v) land tenure changes and home ownership; (vi) national security; and (vii)
wealth creation. The Bank's support for this agenda is formulated in the 2009-2013 CPS,
presented to the Boardjointly with this proposed credit.

6.      The global financial crisis and the associated economic downturn have affected Nigerian
macroeconomic indicators, as manifested in: (i) lower share prices and market capitalization on
the Nigerian Stock Exchange Market (NSE); (ii) balance of payment pressures emanating from
lower commodity prices especially oil; (iii) reduced Government revenue; (iv) capital outflows
due to foreign investor flight from the NSE market and withdrawal of dollar-denominated assets
from some banks; and (v) reduced foreign exchangereserves.

7.      Indications are that the miacroeconomic environment is improving, a consequence of
Government's response to the global economic slowdown and improved external environment.
The Government, however, recognizes that global developments will negatively affect real GDP
growth in Nigeria in 2009. The slowdown would definitely impact negatively more on the very
poor segment of the population. In this context and in view of endemic infrastructure and
unemployment challenges, the Government plans to put in place strategic interventions that
would address infiastructurebottlenecks, reduce unemploymentand alleviate poverty.

A. Recent Political Developments

8.      The last decade has been the first period of continuous democratic governance in Nigeria.
Nigeria returned to democratic governance in 1999,after 16 years of military rule. The transitionto
another civilian regime in 2003 was the first civilianto civilian transition the country had recorded.
President Obasanjo was elected in 1999, and then re-elected in 2003. He was succeeded following
the 2007 elections by President Umaru Musa YarYAdua.Nigeria's political terrain through 2008 was
marked challenges regarding the electoral process. However, the outstanding court challenges to the
results of the electoral process were resolved in confirming the result of the 2007 elections outcome.
Already in March 2009 the Federal Executive Council adopted a series of significant electoral
reforms designed to strengthenthe electoral process.

B. Economic Management and Transparency Efforts since 2006

9.      During the period 2001-2008Nigeria's economy grew rapidly. In contrastto previous growth
episodes, recent analysis shows that growth was not primarily driven by rising oil prices-the
economic impact of which was largelyneutralized through fiscal policy-but              by accelerating non-oil
growth. Non-oil growth averaged only about 3-4 percent in 1995-2000,and it more than doubled to
8-9 percent in recent years. Key underpinnings of the growth accelerationin the non-oil sector were
the improvement of macroeconomic management and reforms of the financial sector. Greater
attention was also paid to improving the investment climate, strengtheninggovernance and boosting
investments through privatization. Combined, these attracted increasing capital flows (including
remittances and foreign direct investment), and stimulated domestic demand. Improved
macroeconomic and fiscal management was greatly facilitated by Nigeria's successful efforts to
securethe largest debt write-off in the history of the Paris Club reducing its external debt fiom US$
33 billion in 2003 tojust US$3.5 billion in 2006.

10.     At the center of strong macroeconomic performance was the prudent management of oil
revenue. An oil-price based fiscal rule was introduced in 2004. Under the rule, the approved
budget is based on a conservative reference price for oil, and any excess revenue is saved in
the Excess Crude Account. This mechanism largely de-links expenditure from oil prices by not
only limiting federal expenditure but also subjecting transfers from oil revenue above the oil
reference price to state Governments to a negotiation with the ~ederation.~As a result, the
mechanism succeeded in avoiding boom-bust cycles of spending that had plagued Nigeria
since the 1970s. Sound fiscal policies were twinned with prudent monetary policies to curb the
inflation rates of 40 percent per year in the 1990s to between 14 and 18 percent during 2001-
2005 and to single digits in 2007, only mildly accelerating in 2008. Notwithstanding these
positive developments, the country faces important macroeconomic management challenges
related to its federal structure, with the Excess Crude Account being challenged in courts as
being unconstitutional. Further reforms, including in the area of fiscal federalism, are needed
to ensure that sound fiscal management becomes a responsibility of all levels of ~overnment.~


 Nigeria's constitution provides for allocation of more than 54.2 percent of oil revenue to the states and local
fovernment according to a revenue sharing formula.
 For example, large disbursements from the ECA to states in 2008 could have fuelled unsustainably high
expenditure increases, if the budget execution rate had been higher.

11.     Macroeconomic stabilization was accompanied by a series of reforms aimed at improving
public sector performance and accountability. In the area of public fmancial management, a Fiscal
Responsibility Act (FRA) and new procurement law were passed in 2007 at the federal level and
similar laws are being adopted in all states. The Accounting Transactional Recording and Reporting
System (ATRRS) was rolled out, and a computerized federal payroll management system was
launched. Preparations for the adoption of the Government Integrated Financial Management
Information System (GIFMIS) have gained pace and an E-payment system introduced in 2008
promises to increase transparency and accountability further. These systems reforms are still under
implementation, and need further work to deliver on their promise of transforming budget
management and controls into a fully fimctional set of tools for managing public fmances. In
addition,reform efforts in public financialmanagement at the federal level have not been matched at
the sub-national level, where half of public resources are spent. While some states have made
important strides, others lag behind. The Bank's program supports several reform-minded state
GovernmentsthroughPublicFinancial Management (PFM)diagnostics and reforms.

12.     Successfulinitiatives were undertaken to increase transparency and reduce corruptionthrough
the establishment of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Nigeria also adopted
and is implementingthe Extractive Industries TransparencyInitiative (NEITI) to improve governance
of the oil and gas sector. Disclosure on revenue allocations to all levels of the Government has been
regular through newspapers and Government websites. Nigeria's success in improving the
management of the economy and strengthening governance has also been reflected in a sharply
improved rating on the World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) which rose
fi-om 2.8 in 2006 to 3.4 in 2008. In addition, corruption
perceptions have improved, with Nigeria climbing from           Figure 2: GDP Growth 2005-2008 and
                                                                     Contribution to GDP in 2008

rankings. Notwithstanding these improvements, there is
still scope to reducing corruption and improving
governanceboth atthe federaland the sub-nationallevels.

C. Recent Economic Developments

13.     Following robust growth in 2007, Nigeria's
economic growth decelerated in 2008, in the wake of
the global economic crisis. Gross domestic product
(GDP) grew by an estimated 5.1 percent in real terms in
2008+ompared       with 6.4 percent in 2007. Oil output
declined by 5.5 percent-more      than in previous years               Contribution to GDP ,2008

owing to growing unrest in the Niger Delta. However,                           (percent)
non-oil growth remained buoyant at 7.7 percent,
reflecting growth in all sectors of the economy, in
particular agriculture and services (see Figure 2Error!
Reference source not found.).

14.     High international oil prices until the third
quarter of 2008 and improved non-oil revenue
collections kept the fiscal position relatively strong. In

the first three quarters of 2008, the price of oil in the international market remained very high,
reaching an all-time high of US$ 147 per barrel in July (as against an oil reference price in the
2008 budget of US$ 59). As a result, oil revenue significantly exceeded the budget leading to
savings in the Excess Crude Account of about US$ 18 billion at end-2008. Also, reflecting
improvements in tax administration, non-oil revenue exceeded budget projections and was
significantly above 2007 collections.

15.     The overall fiscal balance of the consolidated Government in 2008 was a robust 5 percent
of GDP. Total consolidated Government expenditure in 2008 fell marginally from 29.5 percent
of GDP in 2007 to 27.8 percent in 2008. While federal Governmelit expenditure is estimated to
have fallen from 15.9 percent of GDP in 2007 to 13.5 percent in 2008, states and local
Government (SLG) expenditure is projected to have risen from 12.4 percent to 13.8 percent.
Recurrent expenditure accounted for 84 percent of federal expenditure.

16.     In view of the uncertain duration and depth of the crisis the federal Government
continues to exercise caution in using the Excess Crude Account (ECA) and limits draw-downs
to offset shortfalls in revenue and to finance critical infrastructure. In the first half of 2008, a
total of US$ 6.8 billion was shared from the ECA with states. In June 2008, US$ 5.3 billion from
the ECA were allocated to the power sector, and the bulk of these resources have been
withdrawn into a separate account for managing the power sector investments.

17.     Headline inflation increased well above the
                                                                    Figure 3: Inflation 2005-2008

(year-on-year) in December (see Figure 3). This

hike was due not only to the increase in food

was concentrated in a few sub-sectors: oil and gas,
telecommunications, and wholesale and retail trade. However, individuals and households
increasingly benefited from consunier and mortgage credits. Growth in credit to the private
sector slowed down significantly at end-2008, as foreign trade credit lines to Nigerian banks
began to dry up as a result of the global economic crisis, and the decline in Nigeria's stock
market affected banks' asset quality.

19.     The fall of oil prices and declining capital inflows led to a substantial reduction in foreign
currency inflows and a sharp decline in the exchange rate, prompting the central bank to reintroduce
temporary exchange controls. In an effort to stern the depreciation of the exchange rate, in January
2009, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) imposed temporary exchange controlsthat effectively led to
a suspensioiiofthe credit of the interbankforeign currencymarket. These measureshave had the effect
of stabilizing the exchangerate inthe CentralBank oflicial window at between W144.54146.5 to the
US$ since end-January 2009. However, they have also resulted in increased activity in the parallel

market4 for foreign exchange where the rate of depreciation is much higher. Initially the spread
between the parallel market and the official rate was about 38 percent (between end-November 2008
and end-March 2009), but followingthe announcementon May 21St,2009, of the authorities' intention
to normalizethe foreign exchange market within 3 months and a set of measures lesseningthe impact
of the restrictions the spreadhas declinedto around 10percent.

20.      The decline of the stock market in combination with coizcerns raised in the media about the
accuracy of banks' financial reporting, and depreciation of the exchange rate led to stress on the
banking system. Concernswereraised aboutthe true level of capitalizationofthe banks. In conjunction
with the ten-fold increase in bank minimum capital to W 25 billion (introduced as of end-December
2006) many banks made initial public offerings (IPOs). At the time the demand for bank shares far
outstripped the supply, leading to a sharp rise in share prices and encouraging the banks to make
repeated shareofferings.As a result severalbanks managed to accumulatecapitalof overW 100billion.
When stock market prices adjusted both as a result of portfolio outflowsresulting fiomthe global crisis
as well as the adjustment to more sustainable pricelearnings ratios on the Nigerian market, banks in
Nigeria were heavily impacted, particularly because they had lent to customers both directly and
through their broking subsidiaries for the purpose of purchasing shares. The CBN is monitoring the
situation of individual banks carefilly and has determined that the impact of this margin lending on
bank solvency is manageable for the banking system, given its high level of the capitalization.
Nonetheless, uncertainty as to the extent of individual bank's exposures awakened fears regardingthe
quality of bank disclosure and reporting practices. Particular concerns relate to the reporting of the
value of investments at cost rather thanmarket value; provisioning for non-performing loans based on
time overdue rather than their expected recovery; and the lack of consolidation in both financial
reporting and supervisionofbanks andtheir subsidiariesand affiliates.

21.      In early 2009 when these domestic factors were compounded by the liquidity impact of the
global crisis on trade, portfolio, remittance and Foreign Direct Deposit (FDI) inflowsbank depositors'
confidence was undermined, and deposit interest rates rose sharply as banks began to compete for
liquidity and banks with liquidity hoarded cash and reduced their counterparty risk on the interbank
market, firms and individuals also hoarded foreign currency to avoid temporary foreign exchange
restrictions,and a "flight to quality" took place. In response, the CBN took actionto supplyliq~udityto
the banking systemby opening an extended window facility, reducing liquidityratio requirements,and
reducing reserve requirements. These measures were supplemented by temporary interest rate caps
imposed (at the request of the banking industry) to reduce price-based competition for deposits. In
combination, these measures have restored some confidence to the system, with borrowing from the
extended window facility falling from a peak of about W 480 billiodday in November and December
2008 to about W 280 billionlday in mid-May 2009, and banks also reported in May 2009 that deposit
interestrateshave alsobegun to fall inlinewiththe reduced liquiditypressure.

D. Macroeconomic Outlook

22.      The Governmentremains committed to sound macroeconomicmanagement,and maintains an
adequate macroeconomic policy stance. In piloting the economy through this difficult year, the
Government is appropriately trying to sustain Government spending, but with a focus on improving

market due to tax, customs, and excise evasion.

effectiveness of expenditure for growth and employment creation. Annex 3 provides the related
assessment by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the adequacy of the medium-term
macroeconomicframework.

23.         Low growth is projected for 2009-2010, with a subsequent slow recovery (Table 1). Over the
medium term, non-oil growth is expected to accelerate fiom about 3 percent in 2009-2010 to 6.5
percent in 2014, reflecting the gradual recovery of the economy following the end of the global
financial crisis.

24.     Followingthe sharpdecline in oil revenue,the overall fiscal balance is projected to turn from a
s~uplusof 5 percent of GDP in 2008 into a consolidated deficit of 8.4 percent of GDP in 2009 and 3.4
percent of GDP in2010. Theprojectedwidening of the fiscaldeficitis based on a conservativeoilprice
of US$45/bbl. The primary deficit as a percentage of non-oil GDP is expected to improve from 27.8
percent in 2008 to 25.1 and 22 percent in 2009 and 2010 respectively, reflecting the fact that much of
the increase in the overall deficit is on account of higher capital expenditure.Under the medium-term
projections,the budget would be graduallyreturning to overall balance by 2014.

25.     Despite the economic downturn, the federal Government is. maintaining efforts to
strengthen the fiscal balance and reprioritize Government spending. In response to the crisis, the
2009 budget caps recurrent expenditure, and makes a determined effort at targeting major growth
bottlenecks through higher allocations for capital spending in priority sectors. In percent of non-
oil GDP, recurrent expenditure will decline by 1.3 percentage points in 2009 reflecting cuts in
overhead expenditure due to reduced international travel and transport, workshops, and meal
entitlements. Capital expenditure will increase by 2.4 percentage points of noii-oil GDP in 2009,
mostly in the area of works, housing, agriculture, transport and power (see Table 2).

26.     In terms of the capital spending, the federal Government is seeking to both to increase
allocations and accelerate execution compared with 2008. The content of the capital budget, in
line of the division of labor within the federation, focuses on roads, agriculturelwater, and power
(Figure 4). In addition 6 percent of the capital budget is distributed as grants through the MDG
office. Faster execution of works, power projects, and investment in priority sectors or
distribution of grants will have a direct employment effect, but also address longer-term supply
bottlenecks.

proactive response by the central bank.

Headline inflation (on an annual average                                                                                          1
basis) is projected to increase from 11.2
percent in 2008 to 14.2 percent in 2009,
partly reflecting the impact of strong growth
in monetary aggregates in 2008. Medium-
term projections assume that inflation will
remain between 8 and 9 percent.

30.     Nigeria's current account balance is
projected to move from a surplus of 4.5
percent of GDP in 2008 to a deficit of 9
percent of GDP in 2009 and 3.5 percent of
GDP     in   2010     (Figure    6),  reflecting
significantly lower oil exports and the sharp decline in oil prices from peak levels in 2008. The
current account is projected to improve gradually but remain in deficit in the medium-term
through 2014. External reserves are projected to continue to decline from a peak of US$ 62

billion in September 2008 to US$ 39.6 billion (about 8.8 months of import cover) by end-2009
and US$37 billion (about 7.5 months of import cover)by end-2010.

31.     A debt sustainability analysis conducted in 2008 by Nigeria's Debt Management Office
found that Nigeria's debt outlook was robust. The results were confirmed by Bank and Fund
staffs' calculations. Despite the significant changes in oil prices since the completion of the last
Debt SustainabilityAnalysis, in view of very low debt servicing ratios, the risk of debt default
over the medium term remains low. Under a scenario of a prolonged oil price shock (calibrated
as one standard deviation of Brent crude prices over the period 1970-2006) Nigeria's external
debt ratio could reach 37 percent of GDP by 2027, but debt service payments would remain low
at around 1 percent of exports. The bulk of current outstanding external debt is to multilateral
creditors, and Government continues to reiterate its desire to contract any future borrowings on
concessional terms. The stock of domestic debt of the federal Government has increased only
modestly since 2005, mostly as a result of the securitizationof budget and pension arrears.

32.     The Nigerian authorities intend to continue implementing reforms aimed at ensuring
long-term debt sustainability. Key elements of the debt management framework include: (i)
limiting external borrowing to concessional terms and specified thresholds to ensure debt
sustainabilityin the future; (ii) requiring state Governments to seek federal Government approval
for external borrowing; (iii) setting guidelines and limits on federal guaranteesfor borrowing by
parastatals; and (iv) improving data on public debt. To address concerns about domestic
borrowing at state and local Government levels, the CBN has significantly increased
provisioning requirements for commercial bank lending to sub-national Governments, while the
Securities and Exchange Commission introduced rules for sub-national bond issuance that
significantly reduce the risk of default on sub-national debt.

33.     Long-term challenges and risks remain for staying on a sustainablefiscal path (Figure 7).
These challenges result from the careful equilibrium in managing- the excess crude account
                                                                    -

between the different levels of Government.A break-down of this consensus-driven approach to
                                                                                         - -
reducing the impact of oil price volatility on spending would destabilize macroeconomic
aggregates. Similarly, a successful challenge to

sustainable fiscal management. However,
Government's strict adherence to the oil-price
based fiscal rule coupled with a conservative
estimate of the 2009 oil reference price of US$
45 per barrel bodes well for addressing the
challenge.    The     Government       has    also
established and continues to empower the
Fiscal Responsibility Commission to monitor
and enforcethe provisions of the FRA.

E. Status of IMF activities in Nigeria

34.     In 2005, Nigeria became the first country to adopt an IMF Policy Support Instrument
(PSI), which expired in late 2007. The PSI supported Nigeria's reform program set out in the
homegrown National Economic Empowerment & Development Strategy (NEEDS) of 2004 -
2007. The IMF commended Nigeria's performance under the program in the area of
macroeconomic policy and structural reforms, noting that the development of a strong policy
framework, supported by continued political commitment, was critical to preserving the gains.
The authoritieshave indicated interest in a successor prograni. In March 2009, an IMF staff visit
took place to assess the impact of the current crisis. The IMF cautioned about the temporary
exchange controls imposed by the Central Bank and highlighted the downside risks for the 2009
budget.5 The most recent assessment, which confirms the adequacy of the medium-term
macroeconomic framework in the face of the global financial crisis, is attached in Annex 3.

F. Governance

35.     Significant progress has been made on governance which needs further strengthening.
The recent and substantial improvements in macroeconomicstabilizationwere accompaniedby a
series of reforms aimed at strengthening the institutional and legal frameworks for transparency,
accountability and public sector performance. These include putting in place the FRA, the NEITI
and Public Procurement legislations at the Federal level in 2007, consistent with best
international practices. The implementation of these new Laws is ongoing and in need of further
support--cascading down to the sub-national levels of Government. The Accounting
Transactional Recording and Reporting System (ATRRS) was rolled out, and an Integrated
Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) was launched in 2007 leading to significant
savings on the wage bill in six pilot Ministries,Departments and Agencies (MDAs). Preparations
for the adoption of the Government Integrated Financial Management Information System
(GIFMIS) have gained pace and an E-payment system introduced in 2008 promises to increase
transparency and accountability further. The Auditor General has significantly reduced the
backlog of audit reports up to 2006.

36.     The passage of the procurement law was followed by: (i) the establishment of a
regulatory agency (Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP)) that provides procurement oversight
function; and (ii) development of some procurement tools such as implementation regulations
and the National Procurement Manual. The creation of a professional procurement cadre in the
civil service has further enhanced the quality of procurement. Competitive bidding in public
contracts is now widespread with significant savings being made and there are improved
consultations with anti-corruption agencies, civil societyorganizations(CSOs) and parliamentary
oversight committees.

37.     On the Anti-Corruption front, Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission
(EFCC) has made significant in-roads on indicting high level corrupt officials and recovery of
stolen assets as well as on internet fraud in the past 4-5 years. These achievements are reflected
in improvements in Nigeria's TI corruption perception index from 101'' out of 102 countries in

important challenges both at the federal and the state level.

39.     Obtaining more current poverty estimates will have to await the results of the new NLSS
(2009) currently being conducted, with results expected by the end of 2009. However, strong
growth in the non-oil economy, especially since 2003, suggests that poverty is likely to have
fallen substantially, especially as growth has been buoyant in all sectors and was driven
primarily by agriculture. This conclusionis also supported by a recent analysis of data of General
Household Surveys of 1999, 2004 and 2006 which indicate that real incomes in the formal and
the informal sectors have risen significantlyin real terms, especially in the mral informal sector.

A. Government's Response to the Unfolding Crisis

40.     The impact of the international financial crisis began to be felt in Nigeria in the fall of
2008. In response the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) and the CBN took a number of
immediate and proactive actions which, in some cases, rapidly accelerated implementation of
key components of Nigeria's long term reform program developed with bank and donor support
under the aegis of the Financial Sector Strategy 2020 (FSS 2020) framework, an agenda
described in detail in (Table 2), and public financial management reform. The measures
undertaken in response to the crisis included establishing a Presidential Committee to coordinate
FGN's anti-crisis program; measures to stabilize the banking system and restore confidence;
fiscal adjustments including work to develop progranls to offset the impact of the economic
slowdown on the poor; and, administrative reforms designed to improve revenue collection and
the quality and transparency of Government expenditures. These policies (includingthe oil-price
based fiscal rule, targeting of growth bottlenecks, containing recurrent costs and wages, tackling
subsidies, and prudent borrowing) will be important to build the confidence of domestic and
international investors in the Government's ability to stay on a sustainablepath and help mitigate
the crisis.

           Creating a Presidential Committee to coordinate the response to the crisis: In January
           2009, the President inaugurated this committee which is chaired by the President

himself and which includes key Government Ministers, four prominent State
Governors, business leaders, academics and the trade unions. The Committee meets
on a regular basis and has proven an effective mechanism for coordination as well as
consensus building around measures to be taken.

Adopted a framework for strategic interventions to address supply constraints and
unemployment in the context of global economic crisis: With a view to addressing the
crisis the presidential committee to coordinate the response to the crisis already
approved a framework to improve growth prospects, notably: (i) the upgrading of key
roads; and (ii) the adoption of a massive program of relatively small maintenance and
clean-up projects for roads, drainage and other basic infrastructure.

Stabilizing the banking system. The CBN acted swiftly to counteract liquidity stress
in the banking system as a result of a combination of exchange rate depreciation,
hoarding of liquidity by banks, firms, and individuals, and a "fight to quality" by
depositors. An extended borrowing window was opened at the CBN to provide
liquidity for up to 365 days, and access to the window was eased by expanding the
range of acceptable collateral to include high quality commercial paper. The CBN
facility is backed up by liquidity borrowing facilities available from the Nigerian
Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) for banks in full regulatory compliance (this
facility has so far not been used). Liquidity pressures have been eased further by a
stepped reduction of reserve requirements from 4 percent to 1 percent and of the
regulatory bank liquidity ratio requirement from 40 percent to 25 percent. Interest rate
pressures on banks were eased by reducing the Monetary Policy Rate from 9.75
percent to 8 percent and, at the banking industry's request, the imposition of
temporary interest rate caps to dampen the bidding up of deposit rates. In
combination, these measures have been successful in reducing liquidity stress on the
system and restoring some liquidity to the interbank market: daily borrowing from the
extended window facility fell from a peak of about 86 480 billion in November and
December 2008 to about 86 280 billion in mid-May 2009, and in the same month
banks reported that deposit rates had begun to fall below the cap rate 15 percent and
limited liquidity was returning to the interbank market.

Improving the transparency of the banking system to improve depositor and investor
confidence (Box 1). As the international financial crisis developed starting in mid-
2008, the CBN swiftly accelerated the implementation of measures to strengthen bank
supervision and the quality of bank financial reporting which had formed part of the
FSS2020 medium tern1 agenda to upgrade the quality and reputation of the banking
system to international standards. These measures included: announcing that banks
would be required to convert to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as
of 31StDecember 2010; initiating the procurement process for a major international
accounting firm to assist the CBN with transitioning to IFRS-based supervision and
regulation; requiring all banks to adopt a common financial year end of 31 December;
placing resident bank inspectors in all banks to continuously monitor them; adopting
a program for the introduction of consolidated risk-based supervision; and,
implementing the e-FASS information system which provides real time data on
banking transactions to improve the CBN's ability to monitor and analyze the system.

These measures to improve supervision were supplemented by the issuance of
regulations covering the operation of private credit bureaus and, by May 2009, the
issuance of the first two provisional licenses to private bureaus. The development of
the private credit information industry should enable banks to better manage their
credit risks using higlier quality and more timely information on borrowers.


 Box 1: Investors See Upgrading Banks' Reporting & Governance as Essential

 "Following three strong years of growth in capital and assets, Nigerian banks have evolved very
 rapidly from the small, fragmented, and structurally weak players of the pre-consolidation
 era....Nigerian banks have also become more complex on account of the increased variety of assets,
 liabilities and to some extent, capital structures that they have since acquired. This increased balance
 sheet variety has not been accompanied by sufficiently more advanced levels of financial reporting,
 both in terms of frequency and depth of reporting. Whereas the typical pre-consolidation bank might
 be limited in its credit risk exposure only to large corporate, foreign and local banking counterparties
 and the Federal Government, current bank balance sheets are more likely to include unsecured
 consumer credit risk, trade finance exposure, equity markets risk, sovereign fixed income and
 corporate lending risk, corporate or residentialreal estate backed debt, as well as significant potential
 for foreign currency risk as part of large scale asset and liability transactions with international
 counterparties. Given these new realities, accounting and financial reporting standards that may have
 been sufficient in the years before 2005 have now become at best archaic as a basis for continuous
 public assessment of conxnercial bank's financialposition and performance."

Recasting the budget: Prior to September2008, the Government had announced an oil
reference price of US$ 62.5 per barrel. This was quickly reduced to a much more
conservative price US$45 per barrel-the               lowest among oil producers-which            has to
date proved a far more accurate and prudent forecast, resulting in an overall sound
budgetary framework, albeit not one free of risks from further declines in oil
production and prices.

Upholding the use of the Excess Crude Account: In 2008 the National Economic
Council decided to allocate withdrawals to finance ongoing and critical projects in the
power sector (US$ 5.3 billion). The Government recognizes the need to retain
balances on the Excess Crude Account so as to have a fiscal cushion with which to
address eventual medium term needs, especiallyshould the crisis persist.

In early-2009 the Government inaugurated the Fiscal Responsibility Conmission to
monitor and enforce the provisions of the 2007 Fiscal Responsibility Act. The Fiscal
Responsibility Commission, which includes members of the private sector and of
NGO's in addition to Government officials, is empowered to review the
implementation of the F M , investigate contraventions to the act and report them to
the National Assembly

Eliminating non-essential recurrent expenditure and focus on priority sectors: The
2009 budget shifts the focus from recurrent to capital expenditure to spur growth and
tackle infrastructure bottlenecks. To limit current expenditure, measures were put in
place to contain overhead expenditureand the wage bill. The 2009 budget shifts focus

             from recurrent to capital expenditure to spur growth and tackle infrastructure
             bottlenecks. It undertook a detailed review of bottlenecks in capital budget execution
             and took measures to accelerate the releases of the capital budget and remove
             procedural bottlenecks without jeopardizing quality. In addition, employment-
             intensive projects to rehabilitate physical infrastructure are a focus of additional
             spending expected to boost incomes and address poverty. Overall these efforts result
             in a strong improvement of the quality of the 2009 budget from a development
             perspective. The Government has also announced its intent to further prioritize the
             budget through the use of the Cash Management Committee, and a further round of
             elimination of less essential spending and introduction of priority spending in key
             areas of service de1ivery.s

             Deregulation of the petroleum downstream sector: With a view to improving the
             efficiency of the petroleum downstream sector and creating conditions conducive to
             investment by the private sector, the Government decided to embark upon the
             deregulationof the petroleum downstream sector.

             Intense efforts are underway to improve the quality of spending and the execution of
             the budget: This includes significant reforms in the area of Public Financial
             Management and Procurement where the Bank and other donors are supporting a
             wide-ranging program of reforms at the federal and state level. In addition, the
             Government has developed Medium Term Sector Strategies for most key sectors of
             the economyto form the basis for budgeting and investment planning. Availability of
             funds for commitment of expenditures is becoming more predictable through cash-
             backing of budget releases. A cash management policy has been prepared with plans
             to implement a Treasury Single Account. Meanwhile, the Government has adopted
             electronic payment through the use of mandates until such time when connectivity
             challenges and use of an integrated inter-switch system is established.

             Initiating reforms aimed at internal revenue generation: The crisis has strongly
             enhanced the awareness of the Nigerian leadership of the need to diversify not only
             the economy but especially the fiscal revenue base. There is now broad recognition
             that this is the only way to ensure Nigeria being on a long term sustainable growth
             path. The Government has therefore formed a Presidential Steering Committee on the                     .
             Global Economic Meltdown with the mandate to develop a two year program for
             customs reform. Ongoing tax administration measures include an increased reliance
             on e-payments (expected to reduce leakages) and increased staffing. In addition,
             actions are taken to continue building on the reforms undertook in 2007 and 2008 by
             further implementation of the four bills adopted in 2007.~The Federal Inland
             Revenue Service (FIRS) is implementing a modernization plan that includes: (i) the
             preparation and implementation of a change-management action plan for FIRS
             organizational reform; (ii) the development of new tax administration procedures to


 The four bills are: the new Federal Inland Revenue Serviceact which raises the status of the FIRS to semi-
autonomous agency and enhances its abilityto raise revenue for its own administration,the Bill for an Act to amend
the Companies Income Tax Act, the Bill for an Act to amend the Value added Tax, and the Bill for anAct to amend
the National Automotive Council Act

           improve transparency and effectiveness, including in collection, audit dispute
           resolution and investigative intelligence and preparation of new operation manuals;
           (iii) the development of institutional capacity of FIRS information systems, including
           preparation of training needs analysis, a comprehensivetraining plan and provision of
           general and specialized staff training; and (iv) the modernization of the basic FIRS
           information system including provision of network facility support, intensive ICT
           training for both senior management and end-users and preparation of a preliminary
           study for integrated tax information management system.

B. Nigeria's development agenda: NEEDS and the 7-Point Agenda linkages

41.    NEEDS. In 2004, the Nigerian Government articulated a poverty reduction strategy - the
National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS). NEEDS was designed
to focus on the four main goals of Wealth Creation, Employment Generation, Poverty Reduction
and Value Re-Orientation. The strategic pillars of NEEDS were: Empowering People, Promoting
Private Enterprise and Changing the Way the Government Does its Work. The strategy was
implemented between 2004 and 2007 and provided effective guidance to the authorities' broad
reform agenda. Key macroeconomic indicators improved during the NEEDS and significant
progress was made in the areas of public expenditure management, governance, transparency and
accountability. Many social indicators also improved, e.g. school enrolment at all levels of
education increased and the HIVIAIDS infection rate declined. However, maternal and infant
mortality rose during the NEEDS implementation period and access to basic health care
remained weak. A successor strategy to NEEDS (NEEDS-11) was prepared shortly before the
beginning of the new administration.

42.    7-Point Agenda. The current administration has articulated its reform priorities in a 7-
point agenda that is based on NEEDS. NEEDS-I1 and the 7-point agenda are currently being
harmonized in a National Development Plan which is pending the approval of the Government.
The seven focus areas of the new strategy are: (i) critical infrastructure (partic~~larlyelectricity
and transport); (ii) Niger Delta regional development; (iii) food security; (iv) human capital
development; (v) land tenure changes and home ownership; (vi) national security; and
(vii) wealth creation. These policy priorities of the Government can be defined as follows:

           Sustainable growth: in the real sector of the economy Building upon the reforms in
           macroeconomic management to foster private sector and employment growth. The
           elements include a firm fiscal policy, transparent fiscal operations, development
           oriented monetary and exchange rate policies, and strengthening of the financial
           sector.

           Physical Infrastructure. In power: develop an integrated, lowest cost, expansion plan
           for the development of the Nigerian electricity industry in the medium and long-term;
           upgrade and reinforce distribution networks; develop an appropriate gas policy to
           encourage production and supply of gas for electricity generation; develop gas
           production and supply infrastructure; and develop a policy on IPPs. In transport:
           provide platforms for public-private partnerships (PPP), which will require extensive
           capacity building in Ministries and agencies. In roads: explore mechanisms to ensure
           funding for maintenance investments. In railways: revive the system and involve the

private sector. In aviation:the priority is to anchor reforms, including a recertification
project, on the National Civil Aviation Authority.

Agriculture: Develop a private sector led input supply and distribution system;
support all-season farmingby promoting rain-fed and irrigated farming with emphasis
on Fadama agriculture; develop markets and agribusinesswith adequate infrastructure
in transport, power and water resources; expand existing initiatives such as bio-fuel;
strengthenagriculture research and streamlinethe extension delivery system; improve
competitiveness of Nigerian agriculture in the international markets; increase the
budgetary allocationto agriculture; reform the land tenure system; and restructure or
replace the National Agricultural and Co-operative Development Bank (NACRDB)to
improve the flow of financeto the agricultural sector.

Human Capital Development: In education - improve the efficiency and effectiveness
of available funds in MDG and Universal Basic Education (UBE) program
implementation, particularly at the state level; design and implement education
reforms at the state level based on Federal education reforms. In health: further define
and coordinate health care responsibilities at the federal, state and local Government
levels; revitalize the primary health care system; fully utilize the potential of Public-
Private Partnerships; increase access to anti-retroviral drugs; substantially reduce
infant and child mortality rates; make substantial progress towards the health related
MDGs; achieve 100 percent success rate in child immunization; and provide
Nigerians with easy access to health insurance.

Security, Law and Order: Improve policing, judicial reforms; give a greater role to
civil society and advocacy groups in educating people on proposed bills and in taking
part in National Assembly public hearings; and improve the Nigerian prison system.

Combating Corruption: Strengthen anti-corruption agencies and establish anti-
corruption units within Ministries; greater transparency in budgetary and fiscal
activities; empower NGOs and civil societies to inquire about Government spending;
improve funding of the Auditor General's office; and pass of the Freedom of
Information Bill.

Niger Delta: In March 2007, the Niger Delta Regional Development Master Plan was
formally launched. The plan, a US$50 billion, 15-yearsequenced framework,aims to
address poverty and community needs in an environmentallyand socially sustainable
manner. Also, in March 2009, the Niger Delta Ministry was established which will be
in charge of implementingthe plan.

C. Nigeria's Financial Sector Reform Strategy

       1. Reforms have greatly strengthened thefinancial sector

43.    While FSS 2020 (see below) lays out a sizeableagenda for furtherreform, it is importantto
recognize that major reform of the financial sector started in 2004 with a 13-pointreform agenda
issued by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). It aimed to transform the financial sector into a
growth catalyst, focusing on increasing minimum capitalization for banks to $425 billion from
December 2005. The financial sector reform efforts also witnessed the phased withdrawal of public
sector funds fEom the banking sector, the adoption of a rule-based regulatory framework and an
automatedprocess for the rendition of returns by banks and other financialinstitutionsthrough the
enhanced Financial Analysis and Surveillance System (e-FASS). A number of relevant laws were
updated and enforced and the period saw a closer collaboration with the Economic and Financial
Crimes Commission (EFCC) in the establishmentof the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), and the
enforcementof the anti-moneylaundering and other economiccrimemeasures.

44.    As a cornerstone of the 13-point reform agenda, the CBN raised the minimum capital
requirement of banks from 812 billion (US$ 15.4 million) to N25 billion (US$ 192 million) in
June 2004 and banks that could not meet this requirement either merged or had their licenses
revoked. By the end of the consolidation exercise in December 2005, the number of banks had
dropped from 89 to 25. The success of these banking sector reforms (Table 5) together with
sound macroeconomicreforms has created opportunitiesfor improvingthe availability of finance
for productive investments, including:

            Banking consolidation has created banks with a significantly increased capital and
            deposit base which can be leveraged for term finance and outreach. As the largest
            financial market in Africa other than SouthAfrica,Nigeria has significant potentialto
            promote financial sector development also on a regional level;

            Nigeria is now rated BB- by Standard & Poor's and itch,^

            Total external debt dropped to US$ 3.5 billion in December 2006, compared to US$
            33 billion in 2003;

            In 2004 a new regulatory framework for the pension system was introduced with the
            establishmentof a strong regulator, the Pension Commission, and the pension system
            for public sector employees was changed from a defined benefit to a funded defined
            contribution system. Pension finds are now worth an estimated 34300 billion (US$
            2.5 billion), with a projected annual growth rate of 15percent; and

            In early 2007, one Nigerian bank issued over-subscribed bonds in the international
            markets without guarantees from any Government or multilateral agency. In addition,
            several other Nigerian banks have accessed several tens of millions of United States
            dollars in lines of credit from international financial institutions without Government
            guarantees.


7Recently, S&P changed its rating outlook from stableto negative, but left the rating unchanged at BB-.

45.      Notwithstanding the tremendous successes achieved under the CBN's 13-point agenda,
the Nigerian authorities are cognizant of the need to further strengthen the financial sector and in
2006 embarked on the development a comprehensive, long-term, strategic plan for the
development of the financial sector -the                                  Financial System Strategy 2020 (FSS 2020). The FSS
2020 steering committee defined the vision for the strategy as follows: "To be the safest and
fastest growingjnancial system amongst emergingmarket countries".

46.      The strategy aims to build on the success of the recent banking sector reforms to promote
greater stability,depth and diversity for the entire financial system. It covers all priority areas of
the financial system. The World Bank, FIRST, IMF and IFC have supported the formulation of
FSS 2020 with extensive technical assistance. Nevertheless, FSS 2020 remains a home grown
approach and is fully owned by the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance, regulatory agencies,
and with industry representatives fully participating.

         2. TheFSS 2020 Frameworkfor Financial Sector Reforms

47.      The process of putting together FSS 2020 was highly consultative involving
representatives of all the regulators, industryparticipants, academics, donors etc. From the outset
'focus groups' were organized for various sub-sectorss. They met regularly and their findings
were reported and discussed at a series of retreats culminating in an international conference held
in June 2007 opened by the President, which provided an official endorsement to the vision
outlined in FSS 2020. Subsequently the Bank worked closely with the CBN to undertake further
diagnostic work to set the baseline and develop an implementable roadmap for FSS 2020
focusing on such areas as: banking sector, payments and remittances, debt management and debt
market development, capital markets, insurance, pensions, housing finance and social housing,
SME access to finance, microfinance, corporate governance, and creditor rights & corporate
insolvency.

48.      In each area, experts drafted concise papers identifying the key challenges to achieving
the FSS 2020 vision and outlining practical, time-bound steps for overcoming them. In many
cases, the papers have been discussed at length by industry stakeholders convened under the
rubric of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) FSS 2020 Working Groups.



 Namely, capital markets, housing finance,regulation and legal framework,insurancemarket, credit market, SMEfinance,
money and FOREX markets, monetary policy, IT and communicationsand human capital as well as qualityassurance.

49.    In an effort to maintain a results-oriented focus, support was also provided in assisting
the CBN in putting together a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework for FSS 2020 and
advising the project implementationunit-housed       (temporarily)by the CBN-in     organizing the
envisaged transition to an implementation office referring to the Steering Committee to be
appointed by the President.

50.    Crucial to the success of FSS 2020 so far is that the strategy and process have all along
been owned and managed by the Nigerian authorities. In supporting the authorities in moving
FSS 2020 from the drawing board to implementation the Bank has broadened its involvement
beyond providing technical support to supporting the complex change management challenge.
This support to FSS 2020 has been greatly appreciated by Nigerian stakeholders, and the
Nigerian authorities have managed ta make significant gains in the area of financial sector
reforms which are elaboratedin the following section.

                    PV. WORLDBANKGROUPSTRATEGY PROPOSEDDPC AND


A. Link to the CountryPartnership Strategy and other Bank operations

5 1.   A new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Nigeria is being presented simultaneously
to the Board with this Credit. The second country partnership strategy covers FY10-13 and
focuses on three themes. These are: (i) improving governance; (ii) maintaining non-oil growth;
and (iii) promoting human development, and were identified in the Government's Seven Point
Agenda and reaffirmed in stakeholder consultations. Governance will be both a core theme and,
because it is fundamental to achieving results in the other two areas, is also a cross-cutting
theme, an integral part of virtually every form of support. When work began on formulating the
CPS I1 in September 2008, the global crisis was just beginning to emerge and had not yet
touched Nigeria. Since then, as discussed in Chapter 1 of the CPS, the Nigerian economy has
begun to feel the effects of the crisis. As a result, the CPS is supportingthe Government, as an
integral part of its assistance program, in dealing with the impact of the global crisis. The focus
of the DPC on strengtheningthe banking sector and on raising Government spending is also fully
aligned with the core theme of governance and that of maintaining non-oil growth. The adoption
of International Financial Reporting Standards, for example, will improve accounting and
auditing standards, at the heart of improved banking sector supervision and governance in the
financial sector (Box 7 CPS 11).

52.     The DPC complements other operations in the Bank's active and prospective portfolio.
Two large CDD operations (Fadama 111, US$ 250m and Community Social Development
Project, US$ 200m) are just starting implementation. These operations will be crucial for
cushioning the impact of the crisis on the rural poor by providing basic social and infiastructure
services to rural communities as well as support for income generating activitiesto small holder
farmers. In addition, the Bank is working wit11 the Government through its Millenium
Development Goals Office (MDG) on designing and rolling out a Conditional Cash Transfer
program based on international best practice. In the power sector, generally accepted to be the
key to unlocking Nigeria's growth potential, the Electricity and Gas Improvement Project is
designed to remedy the key problem of unreliable gas supply to power generating plants, thus
creating the basis for sustainable growth in the sector through PPP investments. This is
complemented by work on the creation of a sound regulatory fiamework for 'PPPs. Finally, the

Bank supports a large portfolio of operations in the human development sector. The health
portfolio will gradually move away from vertical disease programs to a programmatic approach
to mother and child survival. In education the emphasis will be on girl's education in the North
and skills development for the labor market at secondary, vocational and tertiary levels.

53.     In the Niger Delta, the approach will be attentive to the particularly fragile circumstances
of the area. Sustainable development in the Niger Delta will be difficult in the absence of a peace
settlement acceptable to all parties. Nevertheless, the Bank, DFID, USAID and the AfDB
Development Bark have worked closely with UNDP to agree on a joint position on the Niger
Delta. In the absence of a peace settlement, development partners will continue to seek
opportunities to work with state Governments in the Niger Delta which demonstrate commitment
to reform and better governance. The Bank is currently implementing CDD projects in the core
states of Niger Delta (Fadama I11 and Community Social Development), and is in early stages of
discussion with Bayelsa state, initially focusing on analytic work and policy dialogue, leading
eventually to lending in the medium term. The Federal Government created a new ministry in
September 2008, which is expected to be responsible for implementing the 15 year, US$ 50
billion Niger Delta Regional Development Master Plan. Partners will work closely with the
Ministry and its parastatals on future supportto the Niger Delta.

B. Analytical Underpinnings of the Credit

54.     The proposed Credit is intended to provide budgetary support to the FGN to offset the
fiscal impact of the crisis and signal the Bank's endorsement of the accelerated implementation
of reforms in the financial sector, fiscal policy and management, and improvements to
governance which the Government and CBN have undertaken in response to the crisis. Support
for these actions is based on a range of economic and sector work on the Nigerian
macroeconomic and financial sector that were concluded in 2008, includingg:

        1. Financial Sector Development

             Banking Sector Diagnostic: This report focuses on how the banking sector can be a
             major driver in achieving the FSS 2020 vision once it addresses the risks of the
             sector.

        * Housing Finance: This report address the issue of what can be done to close the
             current housing gap, estimated at more than 17million units.

             Social Housing: The focus of this report is primarily on the options available for those
             further down the income distribution to finance their housing needs.

        * Pensions Industry Assessment: This report analyzes and makes recommendations for
             further development of the 2004 pension reform.

        *    Insurance Industry Assessment: This report analyzes the underdevelopment of the
             Nigerian insurancemarket and makes recommendations for reforms.


9A fuller description of the economic and sector work briefly described in this section can be found in Annex 1.

   Access to Finance: This report identifies key issues for microfinance, branchless
   banking and SME finance.

   Capital Markets: The report highlights the sizeable growth experienced in the capital
   market due to structural changes in the financial system and identifies additional
   reforms to ensure its continued development.

a  Report on Observance of Standards and Codes for Creditor Rights: The report found
   that although the Insolvency and Creditor Rights regime of Nigeria is strong in
   certain aspects it remains in urgent need of reform.

   Nigeria Investment Climate Assessment 2008: The ICA 2008 was based on a survey
   of 2,300 enterprises based in Nigeria. It concluded that Nigerian firms are

C. Lessons Learned from Prior Operations

55.     The 2005 CPS reflected four key strategic elements. First, it focused on areas where the
Bank could have "quick wins" to establish the Bank's role, after a relatively modest presence in
Nigeria. Second, it used a lead states approach, which involved selecting states with committed
and capable leaders, and which was to serve as incentives for other states to improve their
governance. Third, the strategy was a formal partnership with DFID. Finally, the strategy
envisaged a gradual increase in the International Development Association (IDA) envelope, as
governance and capacity improved.

56.     In terms of development objectives, the overall outcome was assessed as moderately
satisfactory by the CPS I Completion Report. Moderately satisfactory progress was made on
liunian development indicators (good on HIVIAIDS, immunization coverage, primary school
enrollment and gender ratio, but stagnation in maternal and child mortality rates); good progress
on non-oil growth (including the establishment of regulatory institutions for the
telecommunications and the transport sector, and a number of successful privatizations), and
moderate progress on selected aspects of governance at the federal level, with scope for
improvementremaining at both the federal and the state levels.

57.     Key lesson drawn from the Completion Report of CPS were to focus on the following
areas: (i) power and transport to stimulatenon-oil growth; (ii) human development efforts at state
level with the need to support health systems instead of concentrating resources in vertical
disease programs; (iii) CDD approaches that integrate local and state Governments to ensure
sustainability and maintenance of infrastructure; (iv) move away from a lead state approach
towards a differentiated approach to states; and (vi) expand the partnership with DFID and bring
other developmentpartners on board.

D. Coordinationwith Other DevelopmentPartners

58.     CPS I was a formal partnership with DFID. Under CPS 11, the partnership will be
expanded to include the Afiican Development Bank (AfDB) and USAID as well as DFID and
the World Bank in line with the Government and CPSCR recommendations to enhance
opportunities for donor coordination. The CPS I1 partners account for over 80 percent of
Nigeria's developmentassistance. By agreeing to a singlejoint strategy, partners will strengthen
the likelihood of increasing development effectiveness. Partners will also continue to coordinate
closely with Nigeria's other main development partners, including the UN funds, programs and
agencies, JICA and the European Commission.

59.    In developingFSS 2020 the authoritieshave worked closely with the World Bank, DFID
and the IMF. The intention is to further develop this collaboration in the implementationphase,
including the involvement of other donors such as GTZ and USAID. The technical assistance

required to build the capacity of regulators and private sector participants is considerable. A
comprehensive reform agenda has been developed focusing on developing accounting and
reporting systems, regulatory and supervisory capacity, risk monitoring and managing systems
etc.

60.     Following high-level discussion with the authorities, the AfDB has begun exploration of
a parallel budget support operation for Nigeria that could be on the order of US$ 150 million.
The Bank team will closely coordinate with the AfDB.

     V. GOVERNMENT      OF NIGERIA'SPROPOSEDREFORMPROGRAMSUPPORTED DPC                BY


A. Overview of the DPC

61.     In responding to the on-going global financial crisis the proposed credit is intended to
provide budgetary support to the FGN to offset the fiscal impact of the crisis and support the
Government in maintaining its current economic reform path in the financial sector, fiscal policy
and management, and governance. It builds on strong Government ownership of a medium-term
reform program, which consolidatesthe successful record of economic management and reforms
since 2001, despite occasional setbacks. This strong alignment with home-grown programs,
building on solid achievements to date while adapting the medium-term policies to address the
challenges from the financial crisis, sets it apart from earlier quick disbursing lending operations
in the 1980s as does its emphasis on cushioning the damaging impacts of the financial crisis on
those at the lower end of the income distribution.

        Objective1: Maintaining Confidenceand Stability in the FinancialSystem

62.     The proposed credit lends support to the CBN's measures undertaken to ensure the
stability of the banking system by ensuring its liquidity. The PDO-supported measures are: an
extended borrowing window at the CBN to provide liquidity for up to 365 days and access to the
window was eased by expanding the range of acceptable collateral to include high quality
commercial paper; a back up liquidity borrowing facility available fiom the NDIC for banks in
full regulatory compliance; stepped reductions of reserve requirements fiom 4 percent to 1
percent and reduction of the required bank liquidity ratio from 40 percent to 25 percent;
reduction of the Monetary Policy Rate fiom 9.75 percent to 8 percent intended to dampen the
bidding up of deposit rates. The Government has also adopted a comprehensive plan to increase
the liquidity and efficiencyof the Government debt markets, which should result in an increased
depth of the market and a greater variety of Government debt products and instruments which
participants will be able to manage their liquidity.

63.     In combination, these measures have been successful in reducing liquidity stress on the
system and restoring some liquidity to the interbank market: daily borrowing from the extended
window facility fell fiom a peak of about N 480 billion in November and December 2008 to
about Ba; 280 billion in mid-May 2009, and banks reported that deposit rates hsba begun to fall
below the cap rate 15percent and that limited liquidity was returning to the interbankmarket

        Objective 2: Strengthening the Banking System

64.     The proposed credit lends support to a significant acceleration of measures needed to
strengthen bank supervision and regulation and increase the attractiveness of Nigerian banks for
investors and borrowers. These measures were identified as part of the FSS 2020 medium term
reform agenda and had been the subject of extensive discussions between the Bank and the CBN
and NDIC, but had not been expected to commence implementation in the short term. The
measures include: the CBN's announcement that banks would be required to convert to
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as of 31St December 2010; the CBN's
initiation of the procurement process for a major international accounting firm to assist it with
transitioning to IFRS-based supervision and regulation; requiring all banks to adopt a common
financial year end of 31 December;placing resident bank inspectorsin all banks to continuously
monitor them; adopting a program for the introduction of consolidated risk-based supervision;
and, implementing the e-FASS information system which provides real time data on banking
transactionsto improve the CBN's ability to monitor and analyze the system. These measures to
improve supervision are supplemented by the issuance of regulations covering the operation of
private credit bureaus. The development of the private credit information industry should enable
banks to better manage their credit risks using higher quality and more timely information on
borrowers.

65.     Prior actions identified to occur before closing of the Credit in December 2009 are
designed to support the implementation of the measures to improve bank supervision and
banking sector transparency already announced by the CBN. Once implemented,these measures
should improve the access of Nigerian banks to international debt and equity markets and help to
restore full depositor confidence in the system. These actions include: completion of an
assessment of the financial impact of the introduction of IFRS reporting on banks; issuance by
the Nigerian Accounting Standards Board (NASB) of Nigerian accounting standards (SAS) in
full compliance with IFRS as applied to the banking sector (this will ensure that banks are not
faced with additional costs as a result of having to fulfill regulatory and legal reporting
requirements using different accounting standards); alignment of CBN and NDIC regulations
and supervision with IFRS; implementation of a comprehensive training program for CBN and
NDIC supervisors to allow them to work effectively in an IFRS environment; and, adoption of
the framework for risk based supervision now under consideration by the CBN and NDIC.
Further prior actions will support the commencement of licensing of private credit bureaus and
the issuance of a tender to establish a computerized movable collateral registry. These actions are
intended to support the development of an improved flow of credit information and facilitate an
increase in credit activity by improving the ability of banks and other financial firms to secure
lending.

        Objective3: Supporting the objectivesof the 2009 budgetfocused on raising
        Governmentinvestmentspending to accelerate non-oilgrowth

66.     The proposed credit will provide support to the 2009 budget's objective of maintaining
fiscal stability and continuing emphasis on prioritizing investment to reduce the economy's
dependence on oil exports. The PDO-supports the rebasing of oil revenues using a conservative
averageprice of US$45/bbl., limits current expenditure by containing overhead expenditure and
the wage bill, and tightens restrictions on the use of the ECA, which is now limited to financing

ongoing and critical projects in the power sector and financing the revenue shortfall that
emanated from the crisis. In addition, the Presidential Steering Committee to coordinate the
response to the global crisis has already approved a framework to improve growth prospects,
including through targeted infrastructure projects. The Governmenthas also announcedits intent
to better prioritize spending through the introduction of a Cash Management Committee, and a
further round of elimination of less essential spending and introduction of priority spending in
key areas of service delivery. The Government recognizes the need to retain balances on the
Excess Crude Account so as to have a fiscal cushion with which to address eventual medium
term needs, especially should the crisis persist. Fiscal discipline will be encouraged by the
establishment of the Fiscal Responsibility Commission to monitor expenditures. The budget
supports the strategic objective of encouraging non-oil growth by shifting the focus of
expenditure from recurrent to capital expenditure, which will spur growth and address
infiastructurebottlenecks.

67.      The proposed credit will also supportthe Government's work to improve non-oil revenue
collection and to improvethe quality of expenditure. To reduce oil dependency and provide more
stable revenues by diversifying their sources, the Government has initiated an audit of the
customsrevenue collectionprocess and has initiated a working group to develop two year reform
programs both for tax administration and customs. The quality and governance of expenditure
are being improved by the implementation of an accounting transaction reporting system,
adoption of a cash management policy, and strengthening of the electronic payments system.
These measures are supported by implementation of the Public Procurement Act (which meets
international standards) publication of its regulations, and publication of Government contract
awards in the National Procurement Journal and on its website.

68.      Although the Credit focuses on the federal budget and policies, it is embedded in a
broader agenda of improving fiscal management on the state level. The Bank currently is
supporting several states through both state-level PER'S, PEFA's and procurement assessments
as well as the State Governance and Capacity Building projects. These initiatives build on the
progress that has already been made in several states, notably the adoption of Fiscal
Responsibility and procurement laws, as well as improvements of the payroll payment and
expenditure management system (including through the adoptioii of Integrated Financial &
Economic Management Information Systems (IFEMIS) in a number of states). They aim at
improving the effectivenessof spending on the delivery of social services(notably educationand
health). In combination with improving effectiveness on the federal level, these initiatives are
critical to deliver on the Government's poverty reduction objectives.

B. Proposed DPC Prior Actions

69.     The proposed DPC highlights 13 prior actions that are elaborated below. In addition to

Box 2: Application of Good Practice Principles in Development Policy Lending to the Proposed Credit

Principle 1: Reinforce ownership

  The reform program is filly owned by Government and elaborated both within Government's FSS2020 strategy,
  and the NEEDS and SEEDS documents. The program reflects policy measures which Government has proposed
  and is committed to do.

Principle 2: Agree upfront with the government and otherfinancial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework

  The medium-term policy matrix, which outlines short and medium-tern actions with clear and measurable
  outcome indicators and targets, was developed jointly with the Nigerian authorities and discussed with the IMF
  and other donors.

Principle 3: Customizethe accountabilityframework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances

  The reform program is based on Nigeria's needs. It reflects the significant policy measures on various fronts
  needed for stabilization of Nigeria's economy, the protection of financial sector reform gains and the enhancement
  of competitiveness and economic growth for poverty reduction. The program also focuses on outcome-oriented
  actions to achieve program objectives.

Principle 4: Choose only actions criticalfor achieving results as conditionsfor disbursement

  The policy matrix focuses on actions that are critical for achieving the set outcome goals. The number of prior
  actions has been limited to thirteen.

Principle 5: Conducttransparentprogress reviews conducivetopredictable and performance-basedfinancialsupport

  Progress made with the implementation of reforms and achievement of outcome goals will be monitored through
  preparation of regular macroeconomic updates, and a progress matrix, which outlines the status of reforms and
  outcome indicators.


70.      Expected Outcomes: The following outcomes are expected to be reached by December
2009, the closing date of for this proposed Credit:

             Banking system liquidity is restored and increased confidence allows normal
             functioning of the interbank markets for Naira and foreign exchange. Government
             debt markets function more efficiently and become more liquid. Use of the extended
             window facility declines from $4 480 billiodday to below $4 200 billiodday; parallel
             market USD exchange rate falls to within 10percent of the interbank rate.

             The banking system becomes more sound and transparent. Capital adequacy ratios
             remain above 15 percent through 2009. Improved reporting and accounting
             encourages investment in bank debt &: equity, and better pricing for debt issuances by
             banks on international markets. Banks' ability to manage risk improved by access
             new sources of credit information.

             Federal Governlent expenditures in 2009 remain within a range of 23-25 percent of
             non-oil GDP (21.2 in 2008,25.4 in 2007,21.4 in 2006).

             The capital budget execution rate rises from 53.6 percent in 2008 to more than 60
             percent in 2009.

             Non-oil revenue increases from 8.6 pe;cent of GDP in 2008 to 9 percent in 2009.

             Month-end financial statements produced by 75 percent of Federal MDAs within 7
             days.

             95 percent of Governmentcontract awards are published.

             The medium-term actions presented in Annex 1are measuresthe Government intends
             to implement following disbursement of the operation. Since this is a single-tranche,
             stand-alone operation, they are not directly supportedby the operation.

             The program supportedby the proposed DPC is elaborated in more detail below. The
             program components include;


         1. Maintaining Confdence and Stability in the Financial System

                 a. Measures to Stabilize the Banking System

71.      Outcome goal. Banking system liquidity is restored and increased confidence allows
normal functioning of the interbank markets for Naira and foreign exchange. Government debt
markets function more efficiently and become more liquid. Use of the extended window facility
declines from W 480 billiodday to below W 200 billiodday; parallel market USD exchange rate
falls to within 10percent of the interbankrate.

72.      Issues. The decline of the stock market in combinationwith concerns raised in the media
about the accuracy of banks' financial reporting, and depreciation of the exchange rate led to
stress on the banking system. Bank depositors' confidencewas undermined, deposit interest rates
rose sharply as banks began to compete for liquidity and highly liquid banks hoarded cash and
reduced counterparty risk from the interbank market, firms and individuals hoarded foreign
currency to avoid temporary foreign exchangerestrictions, and a "flight to quality" took place.

73.      The CBN took action to supply liquidity to the banking system by opening an extended
window facility, reducing liquidity ratio requirements, and reducing reserve requirements. These
measures were supplemented by temporary interest rate caps imposed at the request of the
banking industry to reduce price-based competition for deposits. In combination, these measures
have restored some confidence to the system, with borrowing from the extended window facility
falling from a peak of about W 480 billiodday in November and December 2008 to about W 280
billiodday in mid-May 2009, and banks also report that deposit interest rates have also begun to
fall in line with the reduced liquiditypressure.

74.      Reform Strategy to Reach Outcome Goal: The proposed DPC will support the
following CBN, NDIC, and Govement actions to maintain confidence and the stability of the
Nigerian banking system:

             Measures to reduce liquidity pressures on the banking system: the CBN has
             established an extended borrowiiig window at the CBN to provide liquidity for up to
             365 days and access to the window was eased by expanding the range of acceptable
             collateral to include high quality commercial paper; stepped reductions of reserve

            requirements from 4 percent to 1 percent and reduction of the required bank liquidity
            ratio from 40 percent to 25 percent; reduction of the Monetary Policy Rate from 9.75
            percent to 8 percent intended to dampen the bidding up of deposit rates. The NDIC is
            also maintaining a back up liquidity borrowing facility available to banks in full
            regulatory compliance. Further liquidity is available from the CBN which has
            authority to purchase problem assets from banks.

            The Government has adopted a comprehensive plan to increase the liquidity and
            efficiency of the Government debt markets, which should result in an increased depth
            of the market and a greater variety of Government debt products and instruments,
            thus better enabling market participants to manage their liquidity.

            The CBN's monetary policy committee announced on May 21, 2009 that all
            exchange restrictions would be phased out over the next three months. To this effect
            the CBN put in place a range of measures with immediate effect, including an
            increase in the net foreign exchange position of banks from 1 to 2.5 percent and the
            removal of the requirement for banks to transact at 1percent around the CBN rate and
            increasing from 10 to 60 the number of Bureau de Change participating in the retail
            auction market for foreign exchange.

                6.Strengthening the Banking System

75.    Outcome goal. The banking system becomes more sound and transparent. Capital
adequacy ratios remain above 15 percent through 2009. Improved reporting and accounting
encourages investment in bank debt and equity, and better pricing for debt issuances by banks on
international markets. Banks' ability to manage risk improved by access new sources of credit
information.

76.    Issues. Before the onset of the international financial crisis, the Nigerian banking system
experienced impressive growth in an environment of increased competition. Since 2006, Banks
have been opening new branches, expanding to new geographical areas (including establishing
subsidiaries in other countries), moving into new areas of activity such as retail loans, insurance
and brokerage services and introducing new products. Increased competition has put strains on
profitability.

77.    Overall, the banks' capacity and infrastructure required to adequately manage risks
(which includes bank supervision, accounting and auditing standards and practices, and banks'
internal risk management systems and governance) has struggled to keep up with the dramatic
growth of the system itself. The pace of expansion of banks is creating stress on systems
designed for a much smaller and simpler environment and banks are only now putting in place
the required, more comprehensive risk management systems. Management and specialized
professionals with experience in managing large complex financial institutions are in short
supply, despite efforts to bring in experts with experience from other countries.

78.    The CBN has responded to this increase in vulnerability by attempting to improve
supervision practices (see further description below) and these efforts have been intensified in
the context of the international financial crisis. The global financial turmoil has led to a reversal

of portfolio flows to the country (net equity outflows were estimated to amount to over US$ 3.4
billion in 2008) and precipitated a decline in the Nigerian stock market (over 60 percent in
2008), which has significantly affected Nigerian banks. These institutions formed between 60 to
75 percent of the market capitalizationof the NSE. Moreover, Nigerian banks have increasingly
relied on equity markets to raise capital especially after the consolidation exercise of 2005 and
have engaged in direct and indirect lending for sharepurchases (marginloans).

79.     Given the weaknesses in the accounting and financial reporting framework, there is
considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of the exposure of banks to share lending, but
official reports suggest that it could amount to less than 10 percent of total bank loans. In any
case, losses linked to share lending are likely to appear in balance sheets with some delay, partly
because the CBN in 2008 allowed banks to reschedule debt repayments on margin loans for a
year. Unfortunately most banks do not appear to have taken the opportunityto provision for bad
loans preferringto announce bumper dividends in an attemptto shore up falling share prices.

80.     Given that the expansion of credit was also strong to firms that are second and third tier
suppliers of goods and services to the oil and gas sectors, the quality of loan portfolios is also
vulnerable to recent reductions in oil prices. These price reductions may have a disproportionate
impact on the credit quality of these borrowers, because their position in the supply chain makes
them likely to be the first, and most, affected by the reduced cash flow of the sector and any
reduction in exploration activity.

81.     In addition, a large fraction of corporate audited financial statements may be unreliable
due to weaknesses in second and third tier accounting firms' practices and governance. The
unreliability of corporate financial information increases the risks and costs of financial
intermediation by requiring more due diligence on the part of lenders while simultaneously
making it more difficult for bank supervisors to accurately assess the quality of borrowers, and
hence the need for provisions.

82.     Most Nigerian banks appear to be strongly capitalized, but the banking system is highly
segmented by quality and the recent increase in spreads between interbank rates and T-bill rates
reflects concerns about counterparty risk in the interbank market. Despite double digit inflation,
banks prefer to invest in T-bills yielding as little as 5-7 percent instead of lending on the
interbank market at around 16 percent. This risk aversion is exacerbated by the lack of
transparency in bank balance sheets linked to relatively weak accounting and financial reporting
frameworks.

83.     A weak credit information environment also contributes to increased costs and risks that
banks face, particularly for retail loans as well as loans to small and medium enterprises.
Furthermore, the high costs of contract enforcement in Nigeria, as well as inefficiencies in
mechanisms for enforcement and registration of collateral and antiquated insolvency laws also
increase the costs of financial intermediation and reduce access to finance. Procedures for taking
and registering securities in Nigeria are inefficient and are accompanied by excessively high
filing fees that generate perverse incentives for banking practices such as inaccurate registration.
Overall,the Nigerian legal frameworkis considered to be expensive and time-consuming as well
as typically favoring debtors.

84.    Reform Strategy to Reach Outcome Goal. The proposed DPC will support the following
Government actions to maintain the soundness of the Nigerian banking system and enhance
transparency:

           CBN adopts a timetable for banks to implement IFRS-based regulatory reporting as
           of December 31, 2009. An effort to introduce IFRS in Nigeria is presently being led
           by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Nigerian Accounting
           Standards Board (NASB) for all listed firms in the country, but bank supervisors'
           preparations for the implementation of IFRS by banks are more advanced. The fact
           that financial statements in Nigeria are not prepared according to IFRS" has
           important implications for the transparency and accuracy of financial statements
           (especially for financial intermediaries). Delays in klly implementing IFRS will also
           continue to hamper banking supervisors' ability to detect and anticipate emerging
           problems in the system in the context of the global financial crisis. Crucially, IFRS
           requires full consolidation of subsidiaries and affiliates based on the risks to the
           parent posed by them and the degree of actual control exercised by the parent rather
           than allowing an affiliated company to be treated as an investment. For supervisors
           attempting to implement consolidated supervision, the lack of IFRS reporting may
           thus mask the "full picture" of a banking group's operations and their risks, making a
           comprehensive supervisory assessment more difficult. As part of the IFRS adoption
           process, both bank supervisors (CBN and NDIC) will need to adapt regulations to
           IFRS and, most importantly, train bank inspectors to apply IFRS in the supervision
           process. The CBN has initiated the procurement process for a major international
           accounting firm to provide supportto it during the transitionperiod.

           Adoption of a timetable for all banks to implement a 1 January - 31 December
           financial year with effect from 31 December 2009. At the moment, Nigerian banks
           have varied financial years which creates opportunities for banks to "window dress"
           their results and, also, is believed to create periodic liquidity stresses in the system as
           a result of banks seeking to inflate their balance sheets in order to gain prestige by
           seeming larger. The uneven financial years also creates problems for supervisors by
           making it difficult to accurately compare banks using year-end results, making it
           harder to detect and address trends in the sector. The CBN has now instructed banks
           that all will have financial years ending on 31 December, with the result that as of
           2010comparable period financialreports will be produced.

           Adoption of a program for consolidated risk-based banking supervision. Banking
           supervision in Nigeria is still mainly compliance-based, an approach which has
           inherent shortcomings in its ability to identify problems early in the credit cycle.
           These shortcomings are reinforced when the transparency of banks' reports is limited.
           The CBN and NDIC are moving to consolidated risk-based supervisionwith technical
           assistance from the IMF and DfID. This reform is crucial given the conglomerate
           structure of Nigerian banks. In the short term, the CBN and NDIC bank supervision
           departmentsneed to develop their capacity with great rapidity to meet the challenges
           posed by the explosivegrowth and increasing complexity of the banking system.


loA few banks have voluntarily adopted IFRS as a result of their participation in internationalmarkets.

                                                       33

            CBN and NDIC have also recently implemented a regime of resident examiners.
            Resident examiners will provide continuous supervision of banks. The measures
            taken so far indicate the regulators' commitment to improving supervision,but efforts
            to modernize supervision and regulation will take quite some time to reach fruition
            and will require intensive technical assistance to support the retraining of the CBN
            and NDIC bank supervision departments' management and staff.

            Inlplementation of the Electronic Financial Analysis and Surveillance System
            (eFASS). The CBN has sponsored the move towards the eFASS system that has
            allowed for real time transaction monitoring. This has significantly improved
            statutorycompliance and anti-money laundering programs.

           Adoption of steps to enhance credit information systems. In October 2008, the CBN
            issued licensing regulations for credit bureaus in Nigeria ("Credit Bureau
           Regulations"), which are well designed and should pave the way for development of a
           competitive credit information system. The CBN currently maintains a credit
           informationsystem, the Credit Risk Management System (CRMS), with both positive
           and negative data and a profile on the total liabilities a debtor has acquired within the
           banking system.A total of four private companies of significantsize (and as many as
           four others) are currently operating and waiting to be licensed. These actions have
           created a framework for an improved credit risk management system.


       2. Sustaining Growththrough Sound Macroeconomic Policies and Budget Priorities

                a. Supporting Macroeconomic Stability and Non-oil Growth through Sound
                   Fiscal Policies

85.     Outcome goal. Federal Government expenditure in 2009 remain within a range of 23-25
percent of non-oil GDP (21.2 in 2008'25.4 in 2007'21.4 in 2006).

86.    Issues. Prior to 2003, the Government's expenditure levels were largely determined by
available revenue: In periods of high oil prices, both current and capital expenditure spiked,
while following the end of the oil price boom expenditure were significantly curtailed. The
expenditure retrenchment following the end of a period of high oil prices often led to a
substantial contraction of non-oil economic activity, resulting in the familiar boom-bust cycle.
Moreover, as the scope for expenditure retrenchment was often somewhat limited, periods of
high oil prices were frequently followed by a substantial widening of the fiscal deficit and high
volumes of new domestic and external debt, leading to an unsustainable debt burden. The
establishmentin 2003 of an oil-price based fiscal rule and of an Excess Crude Account where oil
revenue above the established oil reference price were deposited succeeded in ending the period
of boom-bust cycles and helped build support for the October 2005 debt relief deal which
eliminated the bulk of Nigeria's external debt. However, the legality of the Excess Crude
Account continues to be challenged, given that the constitution stipulates that all revenue in the
federation account needs to be shared with all tiers of the Government.

87.    Reform strategy to reach the outcome goal. The proposed DPC will support the
following Government actions to support macroeconomic stability and non-oil growth through
sound fiscalpolicies.

           The Government has enacted a budget using a conservative oil price of US$ 45 per
           barrel and continues to implement a policy under which the Excess Crude Account is
           credited with excess oil revenue (after compensating for any shortfalls in nonoil and
           oil revenue). The oil reference price of US$ 45 is the lowest among oil exporters.
           Although the oil-price based fiscal rule foresees that only shortfalls in oil revenue are
           being compensatedfor through access to the Excess Crude Account, the Government
           has chosen to also compensate for shortfalls in non-oil revenue through the Excess
           Crude Account with a view to ensuring effective implementation of the 2009 budget
           in the context of the global financial crisis.

           The Government has established the Fiscal Responsibility Commission to monitor
           and enforce the provisions of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2007 (gazetted in
           December 2007): The FRA which was enacted by President YarYAduain November
           2007 institutionalizesthe oil-price based fiscal rule and basic principles of the use of
           the Excess Crude Account. It also foresees the regular preparation of a Medium-Term
           Fiscal and Expenditure framework to guide expenditure allocations in conformity
           with the strategic priorities of the Government and limit spending and new debt to
           macro-economically sustainablelevels. Statesare now in the process of adopting their
           own fiscal responsibility bills following the model of the federal Govenment. A key
           innovative feature of the fiscal responsibility bill is the institution of a Fiscal
           Responsibility Commission which consists of Government officials as well as
           members of civil society and the private sector and has broad powers to review the
           implementation of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, investigate contraventions of the Act
           and report these to the National Assembly. The institutionalizedinvolvement of civil
           society and the private sector in monitoring fiscal responsibility provides a new
           mechanism for enhancing the transparency and accountability of resources. The
           inauguration of the commission at this juncture demonstrates the Government's
           resolve to safeguardthe efficiency of Government spending in the wake of the global
           financial crisis.

               b.Adjusting Expenditure Priorities to Economic Challenges

88.    Outcome goal. Capital budget execution rate (in percent of the 2009 budget finally.
approved by the National Assembly rises from 53.6 percent in 2008 to more than 60 percent in
2009.

89.    Issues. The execution of Nigeria's capital budget has been volatile reflecting a variety of
shortcomings, including MDAYscapacity constraints in the area of project design, planning and
supervision and difficulties in the procurement process. The execution of the capital budget was
particularly weak in 2008, largely on account of uncertainties over the 2008 budget (given that
the original 2008 budget was subject to both an amendment and a supplementary budget and its
final version only enacted in November 2008), lack of familiarity with the new procurement

procedures and the late release of the capital vote. Measures to accelerate the execution of the
capital budget are particularly important in view of Nigeria's large infrastructure gap.

90.     Reform strategy to reach the outcomegoal:

            The Government has enacted a budget containing recurrent spending to $41.6273
            trillion (61.4 percent) and increasing capital spending to W1.0223 trillion (38.6
            percent) of the MDA budget. With a view to addressing critical infrastructure
            bottlenecks that affect non-oil growth and constrain private investment as well as
            maintain incomes of those at the lower end of the distribution through employment-
            intensive projects, the 2009 budget foresees a reorientation of spending towards the
            capital budget. While reducing the infrastructuregap has always been a priority of the
            Government, the Government considers alleviation of such bottlenecks particularly
            urgent to mitigate the impact of the crisis on non-oil growth and incomes. The 2009
            budget was signed into law by the President on March 10,2009.

            The Government released capital expenditure of W187 billion to MDAs by January
            2009, (a considerable share of the first quarter capital vote), as against no release in
           the same period 2009. With a view to acceleratingexecution of the capital budget, the
            Government decided to release capital expenditure early in the year as recommended
            by the Review on Capital Budget Implementation (Annex 7). The unavailability of
           resources had been a significant constraint to the effective execution of the capital
           budget in the past. Data from April 2009 indicatethat more than half of capital budget
           resources released so far have been spent.

            The Government has appointed a Presidential Steering Committee on the Global
           Economic Crisis to manage the Government's crisis response. The Presidential
            Steering Committee on the Global Economic Crisis has been an effective instrument
           to coordinate the Government's response to the crisis, including the implementation
            of measures aimed at strengthening the stability of the financial sector and the
           deregulationof the downstreampetroleum sector.

           The Presidential Steering Committee to coordinate the response to the crisis has
            adopted a fran~eworkfor strategic interventions to address supply constraints and
           unemployment in the context of the global economic crisis. To this end, it has
           identified a number of interventions, such as the upgrading of key roads, the adoption
           of a program of relatively small maintenance and clean-up projects, and putting in
           place incentivesfor the use of other ports.

                c. Raising Non-Oil Revenue

91.     Outcome goal. Non-oil revenue increases from 8.6 percent of GDP in 2008 to 9 percent
of GDP in 2009.

92.    Issues. Collection of non-oil revenue has been constrained in the past by capacity
constraints at the Federal Inland Revenue Service and the customs administration.

93.     Reform strategy to reach the outcome goal. The DPC supports the Government's                .
measures to strengthennon-oil revenue collection.

            The Government has initiated audit of processes in revenue collecting agencies.
            Process audits in all revenue-collecting agenciesof the Government are in the process
            of being adopted and are expectedto identify a range of shortcomings.

            The Government has created a customs reform committee. The Government has also
            created a Presidential Task Force on customs reform to comprehensively reforming
            the customs administration, including by reducing leakages and streamlining of
            administrativeprocedures.

               d. Improving TransparencyandAccountabilityfor Use of Public Funds
                  through Effective OversightArrangements

94.     Outcomegoal Month-end financial statements produced by at least 75 percent of Federal
MDAs within 7 days.

95.     Issues. Financial Reporting: Nigeria does not have a national public sector accounting
standard but in 2002 the Federal and State Governments agreed adopted a common reporting
format for the preparation of final accounts. Timely and quality financialreports that are publicly
available provide an opportunity to hold public officers accountability for the use of public
funds. The financial reports should also meet minimum acceptable standards to be useful for
making decision on strategic allocation of resources for service delivery. Although the financial
statements have become timely they do not include all sources of funds. ATRRS has been
deployed to all MDAs and used to submit transcriptsto the Treasury for consolidation.However,
budget figures are not captured to produce budget performance reports.

96.     Chart of Accounts: The current chart account is limited as it does not allow classification
of the budget to align ministries activities with policy priorities. Key segments such as
geographical location, program and projects are missing in the classification system. The
classificationsystem used by the Budget Office is not consistent with the Chart of Accounts used
by the Office of the Accountant General making it difficult to directly report actuals against
approved budget.

97.     Reform strategy to reach the outcomegoal:

            The Governmenthas implemented the interim Accounting TransactionRecording and
            Reporting System (ATRRS). Although ATTRS has been deployed to all MDAs, the
            system is not linked up with the Treasury and manual vote books are still maintained.
            Transcripts are submitted using backup devices. A robust and well secured
            information mariagement system is required to protect the credibility of financial
            reports for decision making. The conceptualization of the Government Integrated
            Financial Management Information System (GIFMIS) has been completed through a
            consultative process under the direction of steering committee chaired by the
            Accountant General and reporting to the Minister of Finance. A phased
            implementation approach has been adopted starting with the core foundation modules

           (General Ledger including bank reconciliation, Appropriation, Expenditure Payment
           and Reporting). The system is expected to become operational in 2010 at the Budget
           Office and the Accountant General's Office and will later be roll-out to MDAs and
           FPOs with additional modules (Purchasing, Revenue, Assets and Inventory);
           interfaces will be provided to existing debt management systems and revenue
           administration systems. The implementation of GIFMIS will transform the way
           Government operates financial management. The quality and timeliness of financial
           reports will also be improved.

           Develop a multi-dimensional chart of accountsto provide a framework to align policy
           priorities with the budget and financialreports. The budget is expectedto translatethe
           policy intent of the Government into costed activities for implementation by the
           various MDAs. In order to be able to analyze and report on the budget, the
           classification system should be flexible enough to allow for aggregation of data as
           well as drill-down to the lowest level. In preparation for the implementation of
           GIFMIS an inter-ministerial committeesis in place to expand the chart of accounts to
           include critical segments such as: fund, organization, program, project, objects and
           location. The aim is to ensure consistencybetween codes used for budget preparation
           and accountingand financial reporting. The new chart of account will be comply with
           the IMF-GFS 2001 manual and provide a framework for preparation of annual
           financial statements in accordance with the International Public Sector Accounting
           Standards.

           The Government has established a cash management committee. Timely availability
           of cash is critical for successful implementation of the budget. Fiscal discipline
           requires keeping expenditure within the Government cash constraints. Reliable
           forecasting tools should be used whereby revenue projections and cash plans will
           inform preparation and publication of Disbursement Schedules as stipulated in the
           Fiscal Responsibility Act. To achieve this, the Office of the Accountant General
           should be in a position to undertake timely and efficient bank reconciliation to
           determine its overall cash position at any point in time. Fragmentation of bank
           accounts in commercial banks and limitations in connectivity infrastructure at the
           MDAs poses a serious challenge to consolidate Government's cash position. The
           recently developed Cash Management Policy notes that "A Treasury Single Account
           (TSA) shall be maintained at Central Bank of Nigeria with each MDA responsible for
           the management of its allocations but effecting payment through the TSA ... up to
           their cash allocation ceiling". With GIFMIS the TSA will be more efficient and
           further solidify the E-Payment system.

               e. ImprovingAccountability9Effectiveness and Valuefor Money in Public
                  Procurement

98.    Outcome goal: 65 percent of Federal Government contracts using national standard
bidding documents and 95 percent of Federal Government contract awards above N75 million
are published.

99.    Issues: Increased value for money (VFM) in the use of public resources: Key elementsof
obtaining value for money in public procurement are unhindered availability of detailed
regulations, relevant procurement tools-standard      bidding document and appropriate human
resources with good skill mix. The public procurement Act and the implementation regulations
have been prepared, but implementationis rather slow. Though standardbidding documentshave
been developed, they are yet to be fully tested and put in use in all MDAs. Standardization of
tender document and its use by MDAs will promote consistency,improved quality and efficiency
of procurement practices and enhanceincreased participation of bidders. In the past, procurement
functions had been managed by administrative staff with little or no experience in procurement.
This led to poor quality of procurement decisions resulting in increasedunit cost of procurement,
corruption and substantial losses to the budget. Establishment and training of a procurement
professional cadre in the public service will address this risk and increase capacity,
professionalism and the cost-effectiveness of public spending. There is the need also to build
EFCC's and anti-corruption agencies capacity to understand the procurement act and reforms for
investigativeand sanctionpurposes.

100.   Reform strategy to reach the outcomegoal:
                                            d




           The Government in 2007, has enacted the Public Procurement Act and developed
           implementation regulations consistent with international best practices. The Act and
           its implementation regulations though consistent with internationalbest practices, will
           only produce the desired result of effective and efficient use of resources if fully
           implemented and in a timely manner. Enforcing compliance with these instruments
           and putting in place mechanism to make them readily available to the public, apart
           from promoting desired integrity and accountability of public procurement, will
           further facilitateand increase public confidence in Governmentprocurement.

           The reform strategy will further support usage of already developed Standard Bidding
           Documents first in pilot MDAs-about      30 percent coverage of procuring entities in
           200819 and then attain 60 percent in 2009110. Also Procurement capacity and training
           needs assessment will be finalized and recommended action plan implemented in
           phases coveringpilot MDAs in FY 2009110 and subsequently all procuring entities by
           2010111. The capacity of EFCC's and other anti-corruption agenciesto understand the
           procurement act and reforms for investigative and sanction purposes will be
           undertaken by Government by end 2010.

           A functional BPP website has been established where relevant information about
           procurement reforms and contract award decisions will be published (in addition to
           publishing them in the procurement Journal). Recently, contract awards for threshold
           above S75 million per contract are published in National Procurement Journal (bi-
           monthly). Government will prepare a procurement perception index using survey of
           private sector perception of public procurement including establishing procurement
           performance benchmarking using OECDIDAC methodology to measure reforms
           progress by Fy2010. Also, a Code of Conduct for civil society participation as
           observers in public procurement process will be prepared and adopted by FY
           200912010.

                                VI. OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

A. ParticipatoryProcess

101.    The specific reforms supported by the proposed Credit are critical elements of the
Government's program responding to the international financial crisis, which is embedded in the
medium-term reform agenda outlined in Section 11. The 2009 budget was debated and amended
in the national assembly, and different viewpoints were widely publicized. The Government has
also presented and debated its policy intentions widely in public fora and through the media.
Reforms in the financial sector involve close consultations with various stakeholders in the
financial sector. Finally, public financial management reforms are introducing transparency into
public financial management (i.e., through publication of contract awards), and participatory
elements in monitoring performance under the Fiscal Responsibility Act.

B. Poverty and Social Aspects

102.    The poverty and social impacts of the international financial crisis in Nigeria are being
felt through the slowdown in non-oil growth, and tightening banking sector liquidity. The
Government's efforts aim at stemming these (indirect) effects through a pursuit of proactive
policy measures on the fiscal side and in the financial sector.

103.    The specific reforms supported by the proposed Credit are likely to have positive poverty
and social impacts by helping to sustain growth and employment. The proposed Credit supports
measures that supply short-term liquidity to the financial sector and over time lead to a more
transparent and better supervised sector. A liquid and stable financial system is critical to
enabling private sector investment and sustaining Nigeria's non-oil growth, in turn raising
income and creating opportunities for the poor. Financial sector development has been a key
element in the growth acceleration during the early 2000s. Expanding access to banking and
financial services beyond the highest income brackets through sustained expansion of the
financial sector also has a direct positive effect on income generation for the poorer segments of
society.

104.    More effective and transparent budget planning and execution will raise the impact of
public investment on addressing growth constraints. The 2009 budget makes a concerted effort to
raise the level of capital spending and execution, and the Government is implementing reforms
to enhance the effectiveness and transparency of spending. As outlined above, the capital budget
includes key investments to address growth bottlenecks in Nigeria, notably through roads,
power, and agricultural investments. Better execution of Government capital spending would
have both an immediate employment impact as well as support long-term growth objectives,
thereby supporting poverty reduction targets. In addition, the Government is re-prioritizing
capital budget releases on a quarterly basis so as to enhance its employment impact, and is
contemplating to further recast the budget with this objective. In combination, these actions
offset some of the negative impact of the financial crisis on employment.

105.    The Credit is embedded in a range of additional initiatives under the medium-term
program aiming at enhancing the poverty impact of Government interventions and protecting
vulnerable groups. First, Government is conducting its own review of poverty and social impacts

of particularly sensitive reforms so as to define appropriate mitigating measures. Second, the
federal Government through the MDG office is experimenting with conditional grants so as to
identify and expand the activities that show greatest potential for impact. The latter is done in a
context of intense investments in improving statistical performance at the federal and state level.
Third, as mentioned above, the Bank and donor community seek to support states in improving
their public financial management so as to ensure that spending at the state level, with its service
delivery implications, improves its impact.

C. Fiduciary Assessment

106.    Public financial management has improved in recent years, and a broad reform program
is being implemented with support of the donor community. The federal Government has
increasingly aligned its budget to the medi~mand longer-term policy priorities defined in
NEEDS and the 7-point agenda of the President. Even though important elements of forward
strategic and budget planning have been incorporated in the annual budget process, the strategic
fr-ameworkremains too broad to guide details of the budget process. A fiscal strategy paper was
prepared in 2007 and updated in 2008, which covers a three year period. The budget
classification system was revised in 2005 yet it needs further upgrading to go beyond financial
compliance and incorporate Government policies, priorities and programs. In addition, the
coding structure has limited flexibility and scope for analyzing different dimensions. To address
this issue, a new chart of accounts is being prepared as part of the introduction of GIFMIS and
will be adopted in 2009.

107.    Since 2003, the federal Government has made a significant effort to advance the reform
of the PFM system. Nonetheless, there is still scope for the improvement of capacity at the
federal level. In particular, there are capacity gaps in the areas of in-year budget monitoring and
control. Monitoring is also hampered by the fact that a considerable portion of federal spending
remains outside the official federal budget. Such off-budget spending includes public
investments in the oil sector ("cash calls"), investments funded with excess oil revenues saved
with the special Government account, and projects funded under the donor supported programs,
including IDA credits.

108.    Several improvements have occurred since 2005 in terms of cash management,
accounting and reporting. At the federal level, the cash management function was strengthened,
and cash releases became more predictable. A decision was made to clean up the Government
balance sheets by writing off long outstanding and largely fictional public liabilities. This will
make future balances more realistic. The Accounting Transactional Recording and Reporting
System (ATRRS) has been rolled out widely in the federal administration. Also, a major contract
was signed to install a computerized federal payroll management system. Much of the
accounting processes, however, continue to remain manual and there are significant backlogs.
Preparations for adoption of the Government Integrated Financial Management Information
System (GIFMIS) have gained pace with the establishment of a GIFMIS steering committee in
September 2007 and core teams.

109.    Progress has been made on timely reconciliation of fiscal and monetary accounts. The
ATRRS supports better reporting and monitoring as well as reconciliation of cash books and
bank statements. CBN has introduced Real Time Gross Processing System (RTGS). This will

improve the timeliness of recording and accounting for revenue and also disbursing of funds.
The implementation of GIFMISwill also further improve the bank reconciliationfunction.

110.    The Offices of the Accountant General and of the Auditor General have made major
progress in reducing the backlog of reports. The audit examination of the financial statementsfor
2002-2006 has been completed and for 2007 the audit examination is in progress. The Auditor-
General for the Federation has forwarded the statements for the years 2002-2005 to the National
Assembly. Of these audits the National Assembly has cleared the audit for 2002-2003. By statute
the Auditor-General is required to publish the financial statementswithin 7 months of the end of
the financial year. The 2008 financial statement is expected to be finalized and submitted for
audit within a few weeks. The implementation of the GIFMIS should greatly improve on the
timeliness and accuracy of management reports and annual statementsof accounts.

111.    The openness and scrutiny of the budget by the Legislature and the public has improved
with the publication of the federal budget on websites and in newspapers. The appropriations
committees of the National Assembly have started the practice of requesting the Executive to
account for use of previous budget allocations before passing the current budget. The
Government continues to regularly disclose information on revenue allocations to all levels of
the Government in widely circulatednewspapers and also on Governmentwebsites.

112.    Challenges remain the lack of consolidated reporting at the federal level, as well as
insufficient reporting on budget assets and liabilities. There is also the need to improve quality
of external budget audit. It is expected that Adoption of a new Audit Law would help accelerate
progress in this area. In the absence of timely audit reports it is difficult to hold budget holders
accountable for the use of public funds. There are few instances of withholding budget
allocations for non-submission of required returns. The PAC has also been able in some
instances to recover revenues not properly accounted for by MDAs. However, the application of
administrative sanctions and prosecution can still be considerably improved.

113.    Starting from 2004 budget, the Government initiated production of annual budget
perforniance reports, which are released to the general public. The Federal Ministry of Finance
produces in-year budget implementation reports on a quarterly basis (within a month after the
end of period). The Government plans to post quarterly budget execution reports on its web-
page.

114.    In procurement, Nigeria has been implementing a reform program based on the
recommendations of the 2000 Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR). The 2007
PEMFAR, shows that implementation of procurement reform has brought about substantial
improvements in obtaining value for money in public sector expenditure. This has fiu-ther
introduced some level of transparency into the country procurement process. Some of the actions
taken by Government to advance the procurement reform in Nigeria include: (a) the
establishment of the procurementprofessionals cadre at the Federal level in 2006; (b) the passage
of the Procurement Bill in June 2007 to further sanitize the public procurement system, which
has often been the subject of abuse and corruption; and (c) the establishment of a functional
regulatory body, the to speed up implementation of recommendations. The BPP has organized a
series of sensitization workshops at the Federal and State levels. The National Bidding

documents have also been produced by BPP. The recent PEMFAR report indicated that contract
prices were reduced substantially.

115.    As regards the control environment at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the IMF
conducted a full safeguards assessment in 2001 with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement,
which expired on October 31, 2001. The assessment, which included an on-site visit, was
completed on November 28, 2001. The assessment concluded that vulnerabilities existed in the
areas of financial reporting and legal structure of the Central Bank. Staff findings and proposed
recommendations are reported in the related staff report. No fwther safeguards assessment has
been conducted. The CBN's financial statements are audited on an annual basis and the reports
rendered timely. The 2008 audited financial statementhas been completed and the auditors gave
an unqualified opinion on the 2007 financial. The reports are made public. Nonetheless, given
the absence of a more recent IMF Safeguards Assessment or equivalent information from other
sources relating to the control environment in the CBN, the foreign exchange proceeds of the
loan will be deposited into a dedicated Bank account, and an independent audit will be carried
out of the flows in this account as outlined below.

D. Disbursement and Auditing

116.    Borrower and credit amount. This Credit is a single tranche IDA Credit of SDR323
million (US$ 500 million equivalent). The tranche would be made available upon Credit
effectiveness.

117.    Disbursement arrangementsand use of funds. The credit amount will be disbursed into a
dedicated foreign currency account of the Borrower at the Central Bank of Nigeria, to be used
exclusively for the proceeds of the DPL. The account will form part of Republic of Nigeria's
foreign exchange reserves. The Borrower will ensure that an equivalent amount of the Loan is
promptly accounted for in its budget management system and thereby be available to finance
budget expenditures of the Republic of Nigeria. The Borrower will provide to the Bank a written
confirmation within 5 working days of disbursement that this accounting has been done, with
supporting details. The government will make withdrawals from this account either directly for
US$ denominated budgetary expenditure, or transfer the resources in local currency where they
will form part of Government Treasury Bank Accounts to finance budgeted expenditures in local
currency. See Figure 8 below depicts the funds flow arrangements. The dedicated accounts and
the transactions therein will be recorded in the Government's budget management and
accounting system.

118.    An audit of the dedicated foreign currency account will be carried out for each fiscal year
of the CBN by independent auditors acceptable to IDA, and submitted to IDA within 4 months
of the end of the fiscal year. The terms of reference of the audit will be agreed before submission
to the Board.

119.   Disbursements of the credit will not be linked to any specific purchases and no
procurement requirements have to be satisfied, except that the Borrower is required to comply
with the standard negative list of excluded items that should not be financed with Bank credit
proceeds. In the event that the proceeds of the credit are used for ineligible purposes as defined
in the Financing Agreement, the equivalent amount of the credit will be cancelled and the
Borrower will be required to refund an amount equal to the amount of the said payment. The
administration of this credit will be the responsibility of the Federal Ministry of Finance.
Ongoing discussions with the Government on the overall reform program being supported by
this Credit will form the basis for reporting on substantive policy issues. Fiduciary aspects and
risks of this Credit are discussed elsewherein this document.

E. EnvironmentalAspects

120.   The specific measures supported by this Credit are not expected to have likely and
significant adverse effects on the environment, natural resources, and forests. Environmental
effects may arise under the broader overall activities funded by the Government's budget, and
implementedunder national regulations, but not be directly linked to the specific policies.

121.   As this is a budget support operation it is not be possible to ring-fence the environmental
impacts of the operation. However, the policies and measures supported by the proposed Credit
could be potentially associated with both positive and negative environmental effects. At a
minimum, the DPC interventions should not exacerbate existing environmental pressures, e.g.
not driving illegal national or regional trade in forest or mineral products. The country has
adequate environmental laws and regulations. However, Nigeria's institutional capacity for
environmental management is still in need of strengthening. States and Local Government Areas
(LGAs) are encouraged to set up their own environmental protection agencies. The capacity of
FME in implementing and enforcing provisions of Nigeria environmental laws will be

strengthened. IDA will work closely with the Federal Government of Nigeria to build
appropriateand pragmatic response measures and guidelines within the StatelFederalsystems.

122.    All of the spendingthat will be supported by the DPC will come under the jurisdiction of
the national systems for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). And the elements of planned
spending at the state and sector levels will also be subject to Nigerian provisions for EIA and the
relevant sector guidelines for infrastructure and manufacturing industries. IDA can support the
Nigerian authoritiesin closelymonitoring these standardsand ensuring that they are met.

123.    Targeted provision of environmental management support to address the health, safety
and environmental challenges in specific areas can be provided by other Bank-funded project.
Given the current level of compliance with national regulations, the DPC targets on
environmental stewardship will be kept under review during the implementation period of the
Credit.

F. Implementation,Monitoring and Evaluation

124.    The Federal Ministry of Finance is coordinating the implementation of the proposed
Credit. The FMF regular shares detailed information on budget implementation on a monthly
basis and can provide daily information on the status of the implementation of the Excess Crude
Account. A regular dialogue on public financial management reform takes place through the
supervision of the Economic Reform and Governance Project, which support a key set of these
reforms.

125.    Those reforms of the financial sector supported by this DPC are overseen by the Central
Bank of Nigeria. The Central Bank bears responsibility for setting the parameters for liquidity
management and for all matters relating to banking supervision, including setting standards for
financial reporting standards for the banking system, implementing supervisory practices, such
as risk-based supervision and consolidated supervision.

126.    The Policy Matrix (Annex 2) provides the list of outcome indicators. The latter were
agreed upon with the Government of Nigeria in 2009. Outconie indicators reflect progress over
an agreed-upon baseline.

G.Risks and Risk Mitigation

127.    Since 2003, Nigeria has made considerable progress in economic management and
strengthening governance, notably reflected in the substantial improvement in Nigeria's ranking
on the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) and on Transparency International's
CorruptionPerception Index (see paragraph 13).Nonetheless, in undertaking an operation of this
size and scale there will clearly be a number of risks involved. Compounded with the usual
operational risks that revolve around; political risk, country risk and fiduciary risk there are the
additional risks associated with the first budget support operation undertaken in Nigeria since
1981.Withinthis context, the major project risks are outlined below.

128.    Governance risk: Nigeria is a country that faces governance challenges. However, there
is now a strong consensus in favor of policies to sustain growth and macro conditions are now
more stable. The Credit includes key prior actions that have already been undertaken and will

                                                 45

strengthen transparency as regards the financial sector and public financial management in
Nigeria.

129.    Political support: Government is strongly committed to taking tough decisions in
supporting of a program of ambitious reforms. These decisions will have to be taken in the
context of a global financial crisis and severe economic downturn that will depress earnings and
could intensifl social tensions. They will also have to be taken in the run-up to an election to be
held in 2011 that promises to be hard fought. However, not using this opportunity to get rid of
wasteful public expenditures and counter-productive economic regulations will in the long run
create an even worse situation. It is important that the potential negative reactions are mitigated
by a strong communications campaign and early signaling of the authorities' medium term
commitment to a policy framework. The latter is evidenced by the attached letter of development
policy.

130.    Economic risks: On the external side, a further reduction in oil prices and the continued
reduction in foreign remittances coupled with a further deterioration in the world economy and
international financial markets could weaken the export sector, reduce household transfers, lower
capital inflows, limit economic growth and reduce flexibility for policy reforms. Owing to these
reasons, the external imbalances may continue to widen despite the short-term measures taken.
This could in turn reduce business and consumer confidence at home and abroad and prompt a
vicious cycle. However the authorities are monitoring the situation carefully and have already
taken steps to relax the temporary exchange rate controls. Nigeria's external reserve situation
remains healthy and has managed to withstand a serious external shock.

131.    Financial sector risks: Given Nigeria's current accounting standards and the continued
worldwide pressure on international financial markets, efforts to shore up the Nigerian banking
sector might not be sufficient. If a few banks within the Nigerian system came under speculative
attack or failed due to internal reasons this could also trigger disturbances in the domestic
financial sector. In such a case, large amounts of money would be required to recapitalize the
banking sector. Although World Bank and IMF staffs consider this possibility very unlikely both
institutions stand ready to support Nigeria with additional cash infusions should such a situation
take place. Once again the Credit itself includes key prior actions in the financial sector that
mitigate against this risk. It also aims to support a medium term program of support for the
financial sector that will help strengthenthe sector and reduce its vulnerabilityin times of global
uncertainty.

132.    Securityissues: There is a risk of deteriorationin the security and law and order situation,
.which could shift Government's focus from economic matters. However, this risk cannot be
directly mitigated. The Credit would rely on the Government's cornniitment to improved
security, as confirmed by the renewed efforts to end militancy in the Delta. Improved security is
one of the points of the President's seven-point agenda. The Government has also showed its
commitment in this area by the recent creation of a ministry for the Niger Delta, and a significant
increase in budgetary allocations.

2     The shockwave of the global financial crisis has served to indicatatne
need for deepening economic reform. We remain committed to diversifying
tne production of our economy. While the current global economrc
rneitdown has come with its attendant challenges, the government will use
it as an opportunity to further improve confidence and stability in ike
financial system, sustain growth through sound macroeconornic polrccss
and budget priorities, Inthis connectior~,enhanced focus will be of brlild::.!g

especially for the youths. The policy agenda of the government going
forward is also discussed.


1     ECONOMIC PERFOMANCEDURING 2004 AND FIRST HALF OF
      2008

4.    Macroeconomic performance was remarkably strong during 2003-
2008 period; Real GDP growth averaged 7.1 percent. Growth was
generally broad-based, as all the sectors with the exception of the oil sector
recorded substantial growth. Fiscal and external positions strengthened
significantly, as evidenced in sustained surplus in the current account
balance (CAB) and enhanced Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and
remittances flow as well as portfolio investments. These developments
culminated in robust external reserves, reaching an historical high of about
US$65 billion on August 8, 2008. The country earned debt forgiveness of
US$18.0 billion and repaid US$12.0 billion, which led to an exit from the
Paris Club of creditors. Nigeria has also successfully ex~tedits London Club
debt by redeeming par bonds (US$1.486 billion) and repurchasing its
promissory notes, culminating in a sustainable public debt position.
Convergence between the official and parallel market exchange rate was
achieved. In addition, the financial sector deepened with the consolidation
of the banking and insurance sub-sectors. A favourable sovereign rating
(BB-) has facilitated placements by Nigerian banks on international
markets.

5     The strong economic performance was underpinned by critical
reforms, including: (i) the adoption of an oil-price based fiscal rule, which
has allowed the government the opportunity to smoothen expenditure,
thereby reducing the historical strong correlation between government's
expenditure and oil-related revenue; (ii) the introduction of Medium-Term
Sector Strategies (MTSSs) and Medium Term Expenditure Frameworks
(MTEFs), with the objective of ensuring consistency between sectoral
spending plans, existing government development priorities, and envisaged
resource envelopes; (iii) enactment of Fiscal Responsibility Legislationand
Public Procurement Acts; (iv) the establishment of Debt Management
Office (DMO), which has contributed immensely to effective debt
management in the country as well as the strengthening of the debt

markets; and (v) successful use by the Central Bank of Nigeria of indirect
(market) instruments, especially the open market operations (OMO) and
discountwindow operationsfor monetary control.

6. Additional measureswere put in placewith the objectiveof increasing
transparency as well as ensuring improved governance, including: (i) the
introduction of a Value for Money audit in government procurement
contracts,; (ii) the rolling out of Accounting Transactional Recording and
ReportingSystem (ATRRS),culminating in timely availability of fiscal data;
(iii) the establishment    of a computerized federal payroll management
system (IPPIS); (iv) the establishment of the Economic and Financial
Crimes Commission (EFCC); and (v)             the   adoption of the Nigeria
Extractive IndustriesTransparency Initiative (NEITI) to improve governance
of the oil and gas sector. The government continues to regularly provide
information on revenue allocations to all levels of the government in widely
circulated newspapersand also on governmentwebsites.

II          THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND THE
            MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTIN NIGERIA

7.     The global financial crisis and the associated economic downturn
have affected Nigerian macroeconomic indicators, as manifested in: (i)
lower share prices and market capitalization on the Nigerian Stock
Exchange (NSE); (ii) balance of payment pressures emanating from lower
commodity prices especially oil; (iii) reduced government revenue; (iv)
capital outflows due to foreign investor flight from the stock market and
withdrawal of dollar-denominatedassets from some banks; and (v) marked
naira depreciationand (vi) reduced foreign exchange reserves.

8.     Indications are that the macroeconomic environment is improving, a
consequence of government's response to the global economic slowdown
(as discussed below) and improved external environment. The NSE has
witnessed improved performance, as reflected in improved share prices
and market capitalization; and there has been a narrowing of the premium
betweenthe market and official exchange rates. The government, however,
recognizesthat global developments will negatively affect real GDP growth
in Nigeria in 2009. In this context and in view of endemic infrastructure and
unemployment challenges, the government plans to put in place strategic
interventions that would address infrastructure bottlenecks and reduce
unemployment.

9.     Against this background and in effectively responding to the on-going
global financial crisis, the Federal Government of Nigeria is seeking
financial support from the World Bank, The envisaged credit is expected to
provide needed financing assistance for strategic interventions and
development priorities as well as support the government in sustaining its
current economic reform path in the financial sector, fiscal management,
and governance.


1111   NIGERIA'SRESPONSE TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS

A.     The New Framework for Economic Management

10. To address the challenge posed by the global crisis, a new
framework for National Economic Management was put in place by the
government. The framework aims at strengthening the capability to
respond to the global meltdown and at the same time laying a good
foundation for sustainable development. The Presidential Steering
Committee on Global Economic Crisis (PSCGEC), which is at the apex of
this new framework, was inaugurated in January 2009. The PSCGEC has
broad Stakeholder Composition, including Executive Governors of Four
States, Ministers, Chief Economic Adviser, Principal Secretary to the
President, Governor of the CBN, Independent Economist, representatives
of the Private and Financial Sectors and Labour Unions. A reinvigorated
and reconstituted National Economic Management Team, with wider
membershipthat cut across the critical sectors of the economy, was put in
place to provide technical support to the Presidential Committee and the
Federal Executive Council. Technical Working Groups, bothering on
macroeconomic management, public finance, the real sector and
infrastructurewere constituted with mandates and work programs. Second-
tier linkages and coordination mechanisms are being developed with
Ministries, Departments and Agencies that are involved in implementingthe
7-Point Agenda.      This  new institutional framework       for  economic
management has proven to be an effective mechanism for consensus
building and in-depth discussion of critical policy issues.

B      Monetary and Credit Policies and the Global Financial Crisis

11.    Monetary policy instruments were aptly adopted to address the
adverse impact of the global financial crisis on the macroeconomic
environment. The focus has been on: improving liquidity in the banking
system; ensuring the stability and strengthening of the banking system and
avoiding undue exchange rate volatility. Specific measures ~~ndertakenare:
(i) series of cuts in the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR), leading to the current
rate of 8 percent; (ii) provision of a new extended window facility and
expansion of the range of acceptable collateral for borrowing; (iii) reduction
of the required liquidity ratio from 40% to 25%; (iv) reduction of reserve
requirement from 4% to 1% and (iv) replacement of the Wholesale Dutch
Auction System (WDAS) with the Retail Dutch Auction System (RDAS),
with a view to eliminating speculative demand for foreign currencies.

12. There has been increased emphasis on the importance of sound
regulatory framework and enhanced supervision of financial system. As
part of measures to ensure data integrity, the Electronic Financial Sector
surveillance (e-FASS) as a tool for banks' returns, was deployed for timely
analysis and identification of early warning signals. Resident examiners
were deployed to banks, which has greatly improved examiners' access to
data and information of banks. The adoption of a common-accountingyear
for all banks is envisaged for end-December 2009. This is very important
for ensuring data integrity and comparability. A timetable for banks to
submit    International Financial Regulatory Standards        (IFRS)-based
regulatory reports as of December 31", 2010 and a program for the
introduction of consolidated risk-based banking supervision have been
adopted.

C.    The 2009 Budget and the Global Economic Slowdown

13. The 2009 budget was prepared against the backdrop of a changed
global landscape and guided by three main principles. First, priority has
been given to critical infrastructure that would aid the development of the
private sector, thereby increasing income-generating opportunities so as to
reduce unemployment and poverty. Second, we have sought: measures
that have the potential to improve the competitiveness of our economy.
Third, with a view to accelerating the return to healthy GDP growth rates,
we have sought measures that promote a more diversified economic base,

tap new opportunities, and provide new economic drivers to benefit Nigeria
in the long run.


14.    In the light of the challenges in the oil market, the 2009 budget puts
increased emphasis on widening the base for non-oil taxes. Specifically,
non-oil revenue is projected to increase by 51.8% from the N1.3 trillion
achieved in 2008 to the N1.973 trillion projected for 2009. The budgeted
increases in non-oil revenues are expected to come not from higher tax
rates, but from securing improvements in the efficiency of collection by the
major revenue generating agencies. The 2009 Budget envisages total
revenuefor the FederalGovernment of N2.2652trillion.

15. The Federal Government has also rationalized expenditure by re-
prioritizingspending to deliver on the promises of the Seven-Point Agenda.
The 2009 Budget allocates 93% of the Capital Expenditure'to five key
priority sectors: (i) critical infrastructure - power, aviation, petroleum
resources, works, transport and infrastructural projects within the Federal
Capital Territory; (ii) human capital development; (iii) land reform and food
security; (iv) Security; and (iv) the Niger Delta. The Aggregate Expenditure
is budgeted at N3.1018 trillion and has the following elements: N1.0223
trillion for Capital Expenditure; N1.6273 trillion is budgeted for Recurrent
Expenditure; N168.62 billion for Statutory Transfers; and an amount of
N283.65 billion for Debt Service.

16. Another special feature of the 2009 Budget is the focus on specific
deliverables in terms of public goods and services that the MDAs have
undertaken to provide to Nigerians. This focus on achieving and tracking
the impact of resources utilized on the welfare of Nigerians is part of the
ongoing reforms to introduce a comprehensive performance-based
budgetingsystem. The measurabletargets and outputs set include:

       Power Generation: delivering 1.2 billion SCF of gas to the domestic
       market to ensure the attainment of the target 6,000MW of power by
       the end of 2009;

       Works; Housing & Urban Development: completing the construction
       and rehabilitation of 3,293km of roads and maintenance of over
       10,000kmof federal roads every year for the next 3 years;

       Health: completing modernizing work on three Teaching Hospitals in
      Awka, Calabar and Ife, and seven Specialist Hospitals in Kaduna,
       Lagos, Kano, Calabar, Enugu, Maiduguri and Abeokuta;

   e   Security: the Police are increasing their investment in community
       policing and are targeting a 40% reduction in crime in 7 cities nation-
      wide, namely Abuja, Lagos, Kano, Ibadan, Port Harcourt, Maiduguri
      and Onitsha.

   o   Food Security: increasing land under cultivation by 5%, optimizing
       220,000 hectares of irrigated land and irrigating 12,000 hectares of
       arable land to increase crop yields by between 50% and 250%, and
       increase agriculture's contributionto GDP by 5%; and

   o  The ~ederal'Capital Territory: completing three key headquarters
       structures, namely the Foreign Affairs Headquarters, the Shehu
       Shagari Complex and the Federal Secretariat Building Phase II
       (Bullet House) so that MDAs can relocate to these premises instead
       of embarking on multiple headquarters projects.

17. The projectedfiscal balance at the federal level for 2009 is a deficit of
about N836.6 billion (3.02 percent of GDP). The deficit is to be financed by
a combination of sources, including outstanding signature bonuses,
proceeds from privatization and withdrawal of some accumulated reserves
that the Government has with the African Development Bank's Nigeria
Trust Fund. The balance is expected to be financed by borrowing from the
domestic and international financial markets. The projected deficit is to
make up for falling oil revenues while ensuring that we keep our
commitment to maintaining essential expenditure, particularly in critical
infrastructure. However, it is our expectation that as the global recession
recedes and our revenues improve, this deficit will be reduced over the
nextfew years to a more modest level.


18. The request for World Bank's assistance is predicated on the need to
finance strategic interventions and development priorities in ,the context of
the 2009 budget, that would help address infrastructure bottlenecks, reduce
unemployment and alleviate poverty. The envisaged credit support from
the World Bank in conjunction with planned reforms in the public financial
management areas would further help in enhancing the effectiveness and
productivity of government's expenditure. Against this background and in
effectively responding to the on-going global financial crisis, the Federal

Government of Nigeria is seeking financial support from the World Bank.
The envisaged credit is expected to support the government in sustaining
its current economic reform path in the financial sector, fiscal policy and
managementand governance.

19. The government is committed to further enhancing expenditure
efficiency in combination with expenditure prioritization.The Excess Crude
Account is also being used to smoothen the adverse impact of the global
economic slowdown on the budgetary revenue. In this connection, the
National Economic Council reached a consensus in March to share US$1.5
billion from *theExcess Crude Account. It must however be indicated that
there is a limit to which the Excess Crude Account can be used to meet the
revenue shortfalls, in view of the 2007 Memorandum of Understanding,
which sets a minimum threshold of N l trillion in the excess crude account.
Notwithstanding more-recent recovery in oil prices, there are still
uncertainties surrounding the duration and depth of the global economic
recession with attendant adverse impact on the budgetary revenue. In this
connection, it is critical that the government continues to exercise caution in
the use of Excess Crude Account with a view to preventing its fast
depletion and the associated negative impact on macroeconomic
indicators. The government continues to work on the modalities for putting
in place a Nigerian Sovereign Wealth Fund.

20. Additional efforts are being made towards ensuring effective
implementation of the 2009 budget. A Cash Management Committee has
been established with the objectives of: (i) managing and controlling cash
available to Government at any point in time; (ii) supporting budget
implementation and promoting efficient resource allocation; (iii) ensuring
that budgetary revenues are realized and that adequate machineries are
put in placefor prompt collection, accounting and remittance to the relevant
revenue accounts on a real-time basis; and (iv) integrating government
cash and debt management.


21.       While efforts are being made to further reprioritize spending as
envisaged in 2009 budget, it is essential that critical expenditures are
preserved and government puts in place strategic interventions that would
help address infrastructure bottlenecksand unemployment in the context of
sharper global economic downturn relative to the level envisaged in the
2009 budget. In an attempt to further respond to the global economic

recession, we plan to urgently put in place measures that would help
address supply bottlenecks and unemployment. Such interventions would
help contribute to the diversification of our economy as well as putting the
country in an enhanced position to be able to withstand any future global
economic challenges.

22.   The envisaged credit support is in alignment with CBN's measures
undertaken to enhance the stability of the banking system by ensuring its
liquidity. The measures, being supported by PDO, are: (i) the putting in
place of a new extended window facility at the CBN and the expansion of
the range of acceptable collateral for borrowing; (ii) reductions of the
required liquidity ratio requirement from 40% to 25%; (iii) stepped
reductions of reserve requirementsfrom 4% to I%; and (iv) reduction of the
Monetary Policy Rate from 9.75% to 8%. The Government remains
committed to ensuring that banking system liquidity is restored as well as
normal functioning of the interbank foreign-exchange markets. In addition,
the government has also adopted a comprehensive plan to increase the
liq~~idityand efficiency of the government debt markets. This holds the
promisefor ensuring increaseddepth of the market and a greater variety of
government debt products and instruments.

25.   The proposed credit lends support to the acceleration of measures
considered vital to strengthening bank supervision and regulation and
further increase the attractiveness of Nigerian banks for investors and
borrowers. These measures were identified as part of the FSS2020
medium term reform agenda, but had not been expected to commence
implementation in the short term. The measures include: the CBN's
announcement that banks would be required to convert to International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) by end-December 2010; the CBN
has adopted a timetable for all banks to implement a lSt       ~anuary-31st
December financial year; a program for the introduction of consolidated
risk-based supervision has been adopted; resident inspectors of banks
have been placed in all banks. These measures would contribute to
ensuring that the banking system becomes more sound and transparent.

26.   The envisaged credit will provide support to the 2009 budget's
objective of sustaining growth through sound macroeconomic policies and
budget priorities. The PDO lends credence to our efforts in making sure
that the 2009 budget was based on a conservative oil price of US$45 /bbl,
in the light of uncertainties in the oil markets. The Federal Government

remains committed to continue to implement a policy under which the
Excess Crude Account is credited with excess oil revenue, after
compensating for shortfall in revenue. These measures would put us in a
positionto havethe Federal Government expenditure in 2009 remain within
a range of 23-25 percent of non-oil GDP.

27.    The PDO is also in support of the strategy to ensure that expenditure
is tilted toward critical infrastructures that would help enhance the
economy's growth potential. In this regard, the 2009 budget contains
recurrent non-debt expenditure at N1.6 trillion (61.4%) and increases
capital spending to about N1 (38.6%) of the Federal Government
expenditure (excluding statutory transfers and debt service). With a view to
ensure high capital implementation rate, capital expenditure of N187 billion
for the first quarter of 2009 was released by January. In view of the
uncertainties surrounding the depth and duration of the global economic
slowdown, the government is in the process of putting in place strategic
interventionsthat would address supply constraintsand unemployment.

28.    The proposed credit, in our view, will also support our efforts towards
further enhancing transparency in budget preparation, execution and
reporting. In this connection, the government has implemented interim
Accounting Transaction Recording and Reporting System (ATRRS). With
the progress made in automating accounting statement, we expect that
about 75% of our MDAs will produce month end financial statement within
7 days. In view of lower-than-envisaged revenue in the first quarter of 2009,
the Cash Management Committee has been resuscitated, with the main
objective of supporting budget implementation and promoting efficient
resource allocation. In the area of public procurement, the Public
Procurement Act and Implementation regulations are consistent with
internationalbest practices. They are operational and made available to the
public. Contract awards are published in National Procurement Journal (bi-
monthly) and BPP website. With the progress already made, we are
committed to ensuring that at least 65% of Federal Government contracts
are based on national standard bidding documents and 95% of Federal
Government contract awards above N75 million are published.

29.   With a view to addressing the impact of the global financial crisis on
the Nigerian economy, the Presidential Steering Committee on Global
Economic Crisis has agreed to a framework on strategic interventions to
help address infrastructure bottlenecksand unemployment.

V       POLICY AGENDA GOING FORWARD

A National Development Plan


30.     The Government's Development Strategy draws from President
Umaru Musa Yar'Aduals 7-Point Agenda, draft NEEDS 2 and Vision 2020.
President Yar'Adua has set out his administration's goals in the form of a
seven-point agenda encompassing the key issues of critical infrastructure-
particularly electricity and transport; Niger Delta Regional Development;
Food Security; Human Capital Development (Health, Education and
Training); Land Tenure Changes and Home Ownership; National Security;
and Wealth Creation.

31.     The National Planning Commission (NPC) is working closely with
the Federal MDAs to develop indices, clear deliverables and timelines
for objectively tracking the implementation process. The Government is
also in the process of developing a comprehensive medium term
development plan. This is expected to bring in the perspectives of
States, Local Government Authorities (LGAs) and private sector into the
formulation of National Development Plan (NDP)' .

32. The major thrust of the 5'h NDP is to achieve high levels of pro-
poor growth, the MDG target and make Nigeria one of the top twenty
largest economies in the world by year 2020. This is also designed at
tackling the problems in the real sector, especially with respect to
physical and human infrastructure, rising levels of unemployment and
poverty as well the current structural and institutional weaknesses in the
economy. The target is to ensure an average annual GDP growth of
7.5% with the non-oil sector being the growth driver from 2010 and
beyond.

33. As part of the efforts in facilitating effective implementation of
the process, it is planned that the NBP framework will be replicated at
,the state level. In this regard, the leadership of States Governments

                           -

'ln this renard, the draft NEEDS-:! has been harmonized with the 7-Point Agenda to form
the draft 5' NDP to span from 2009-2012. Thc process is expected to be completed within 5
           R
months.

is being encouraged to buy-in into the process to facilitate
accelerated development of the country.

34. The long-term economic development strategy of Government is
anchored on the Vision 20:2020. The Vision 2020 framework has been
approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC). The current
Administration has also formally inaugurated the framework for
developing Nigeria's Vision 2020 plan. At the peak of the framework is
the National Council on V2020, which is chaired by Mr. President. The
Council is closely supported by the National Steering Committee which
is the operational arm and chaired by the Honourable MinisterIDeputy
Chairman of NPC. The other key supportive structures include the
Business Support Group, Stakeholder Development Committees and                 .
the National Technical Working Groups (NTWGs) which consist of
private sector experts in relevant thematic areas. The NV20:2020 plan
is expected to be launched by the President in October 2009. The
medium term development plan (5th NDP) is also to serve as
operational vehicle for the implementation of the NV20:2020 plan.

B     Strengthening Public Financial Management (PFM) Systems

35.   Recent progress in further enhancing transparency in the
implementation of the budget included the constitution of the Fiscal
Responsibility Commission. Fiscal prudence is considered important to
macro-economic stability, enhanced growth, wealth creation and poverty
reduction. Inthis regard,the government will continue to apply the oil-price-
based fiscal rule. The Medium Term Sector Strategies for key sectors will
continue to form the basisfor budgeting and investment planning.

36. The government remains committedto movingforward reforms in the
Public Financial Management areas. Envisaged reforms in this area
include: (i) computerization of the Budget Office and Office of the
Accountant General of the Federation (OAGF), with a view to
interconnecting their operations with those of the Bureau of Public
Procurement (BPP) and CBN, under the Government Integrated Financial
Management Information System (GIFMIS); (ii) establishing a well
functioning Treasury Single Account; (iii) institutionalizing a predictableand
timely disbursement of budgeted funds to MDAs; (iv) major initiatives in
ICT applications, which are already underway and include the IPPlS and

the GIFMIS. Government has also directed the fast-tracked implementation
of an e-payment system and integration of IPPlS into the GIFIMIS.

C.    ENHANCING CONFIDENCE AND STABILITY IN THE FINANCIAL
      SYSTEM

37.   Notwith~tanding.the considerable successes achieved under the
CBN's 13-point agenda and in the arena of pension reforms, we are fully
cognizant of the need to further strengthen the financial sector and to this
effect, we have developed a comprehensive, long-term, strategic plan for
the development of the financial sector, underpinned by Financial Sector
Strategy (FSS) 2020. FSS 2020 builds on the success of the financial
sector reforms to promote greater stability, depth and diversity for the entire
financial system. It covers all priority areas of the financial system.


38.   With a view to further strengthening the financial system, the
envisaged financial sector reforms include: (i) adjusting regulatory liquidity
requirements in line with stabilization of system liquidity; (ii) easing and
eventual elimination of extant administrative interest and exchange rate
measures; (iii) consolidating debt portfolio management strategies aiming
at benchmark building; (iv) amending banking regulations, reporting
requirements, and supervisory procedures to conform to International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); and (v) adopting a framework for
risk-basedsupervision.

39.   In conclusion, we would like to reiterate the commitment of the
Government to all these reforms, and we trust that this request for World
Bank support for their implementation will receive your favorable
consideration.

                                Yours sincerely,

 Good n~acroeconolnicmanagement and successful reforms initiated earlier this decade
 have enabled tlle economy to negotiate the global financial crisis front a position of
 strength. The oil price based savings rule has been effective in breaking tlte link betwccn
 public spending and oil prices with a cushion of USS18 billion (15 pcrcent of non-oil GDP)
 of oil revenucs saved by end-2008. The banking sector was recapitalized followilig a
 successful consolidation exercise, paving the way for a rapid expansion of tlte tinancia1
 sector. Increased confidence in economic prospects and managetnent was reflected in higher
 foreign reserves, which peaked at USS62 billion (16 months of in111orts) in September 2008.
 Growth has been robust, with non-oil growth averaging over 9 pcrcent in the past 5 years,
 and inflation is well below rates prevailing earlicr in the decade.

 The impact of the global financial crisis is nevertl~elessexpected to be significant. The
 main transmission mecl~anismis tl~rougllthe lower price of oil, which is putting fiscal and
exter~ialaccounts under signiticant pressure. A lack of high-frequency data niake it difficult
to assess the reaction of the real eco~iol~iyat this stage. However, reduced availability of
financing, constraints on public spending, and uncertainty about global and do~nestic
prospects, ufill weigh heavily on consumptioll and investnlent until well into next year.
Non-oil growth is expected to slow from an estinlated 7.6 percent in 2008 to 4.0 percent in
2009-1 0. Oil production remains constrained by security-related disruptions in tlle Niger
Delta, but is projected to be about 2 millioi?barrels per day-20             percent below its peak in
2005. Overall GDP growth is projected to decline fiom 5.3 percent in 2008 to about 3 percent
in 2009, before recovering slightly to about 3 112percent in 2010. Inflation has ~~ioderated
corn a peak of 15.1pel.cent in Decentber 2008 to 13.3percent in April 2009, and is expected
to fnll to single digits towards the end of this year as the eeonoinic slowdown takes hold and
supply bottlenecks related to domestic fuel sltortagcs ease.

Against this backdrop, the autllorities have souglit to preserve public spending while
allowing the overall fiscal balance to swing into deficit in response to sharply lower oil
revenues. The budget for 2009, which is based on a conservative oil price assi~mptiot~of

signlfieant rcol-~cntationtowards capital projects). It nsstimcs an increase in non-oil revenues
wl~icl~will be d~ffIcultto achieve. though past experience suggests that capital spending is
also likely to be lower than planned. Spending by cash-strapped strite and local governments
is likely to bc significantly recit~ced.At tiic consolidated government level, staff estimate tlint
tlie non-oil prilnary deficit \vill therefore fall from 30 percent of non-oil GDP in 2008 to
about 76 percent in 2009-a      moderately contractiona~-yfiscal stance.


While there is a case for a looser fiscal stance than this fro111a cyclical perspective, the
prudent approacl~being followed by tile atrtliorities is justified. Staff estimate that the
overall fiscal bnlance will swing from a surplus of 3.6 percent of GDP in 2008 to a deficit of
8.6 percent in 2009. In the absence of significant cxternal resources. financing this deficit
domestically will be cltallenging. but feasible through a combination of past oil savings and
borro\ving. The remaining oil savings could in pr~nciplefinance a larger deficit, but the
exceptionally uncertain outlook for oil revenues warrants a degree of caution in determining
the pace at wl~icl~they are utilized. Administrative capacity limits also 1.1eedto be considercd
in any major scaling up of public spending. Next year, based 011 projected oil price of
US$ 75,the financing requirement should fail to a no re conifortable Icvel, with the overall
balance projected to drop to below 4 percent of GDP even after providing for a slight
relaxation in the non-oil deficit to support the domestic economy.


Moiietary and exchange rate policies are returning to a more normal footing as
exreptio~~almeasures to provide liquidity support to the banks and liniit pressure on
the excliange rate are being unwound,


e   LVhcn the global financial crisis broke in September 2008, the central bank responded
    swiftly to safeguard the financial system by providing additional liquidity to the domestic
    nioney markets. As initial uncertainty about flc impact of the crisis has dissipated, and it
    has become clearer that syste~liicliquidity is more than amplc, tile central batik has begun
    to withdraw liquidity suppo~t.The central bank should look to restore conventional
    monetary policy focused on price stability in the period ahead.


a  The exchange rate was allowed to depreciate by 25 percent against the US dollar around
   the turn of the year, but ren~ains,in real effective rerrlis, above its level 12 months ago
   when oil prices where peaking. Tenlporary administrative measures to lirnit the pressure
   on the excllarlgerate, whlch effectively closed tlze interbank market for foreign exchange,
   failed to address the underlying imbalance in supply and demand for foreign exchange. A
   parallel niarket for foreign excl~angereemerged, a large parallel market premiuni
   developed, and foreign reserves continued to decline, reaching US$45 billion in May
   2009. The central bank has begun to ease restr~ctionswith a view to returning to a fully
   liberalized foreign exchange market by August 9009. Building on this. thc exchange rate
   should be allowed to respond flexibly to major external shocks.

Sorne signs of stress are evident in the banking systern as it goes through its first down
turn since a successf111consolidation and recapitalizatio~lprogram. Tlie dirccr impact of
the global financial crisis has been contained: there is   110exposure to complex domestic or
foreign financial instrun~ents:foreign bank ownership is very low; and reliance on foreign
f~rndingis reportedly limited. However, tlie quality of some credit extcnded during the rapid
expatision of the financial sector Iias been questioned (including equity-related lending). An
increasing share of loan pol-tfolios could beeonie lion-pcrforn~ingin tlie current environment
as a result of banks' exposures to equity market losses and other sectors affected by the
econoiiiic do\tlnturn. Poor transparcncy and disclosure on the part of banks tends to preclude
a full understanding of tlie cluality of their assets. This hinders sitpervisors in their assessntait
of potential risks and vulnerabilities in the system, and has likely also contributed to fears of
counter-party risk and segmentation in the interbank market.

Annex 5: Analytical Underpinnings of the Credit

1.      The proposed Credit is intended to provide budgetary support to the FGN to offset the
fiscal impact of the crisis and signal the Bank's endorsement of the accelerated implementation
of reforms in the financial sector, fiscal policy and management, and improvements to
governance which the Government and CBN have undertaken in response to the crisis. Support
for these actions is based on a range of economic and sector work on the Nigerian
macroecoi~omicand financial sector that were concluded in 2008, including:

Financial Sector Development

           Banking Sector Diagnostic: This report focuses on how the banking sector can be a
           major driver in achieving the FSS 2020 vision once it addresses the risks of the
           sector, e.g. strengthening bank risk management capacity and banking supervision,
           transition from Nigerian accounting standards to International Financial Reporting
           Standards (IFRS) and diversify lending exposures away from volatile industries like
           the oil sector.

           Housing Finance: This report address the issue of what can be done to close the
           current housing gap, estimated at more than 17million units. The report recommends
           improving the time and cost of property registration, reforming the primary mortgage
           institutions and the National Housing Trust Fund. The report brings together some of
           the policy lessons learnt in the creation of mortgage liquidity facilities around the
           world and presents this as a possible contribution towards development of the
           mortgage market.

           Social Housing: The focus of this report is primarily on the options available for those
           further down the income distribution to finance their housing needs. It also looks to
           cover other aspects of housing finance, such as access issues and the availability of
           funding for construction of housing. The report is targeted at policy makers both in
           the financial and housing spheresto consider a more broad-based approach to housing
           policy than just relying on the private sector to develop housing which will be paid
           for through mortgages. It suggests the need to develop the Real Estate Investment
           Trust (REIT) framework, create a national framework for housing PPPs, clarify the
           micro-finance rules for housing products and withdraw the proposed VAT increase
           on housing.

           Pensions Industry Assessment: This report presents the background of the 2004
           pension reform which was designed and implemented to: (i) improve the fiscal
           sustainability and welfare adequacy of the pension system; and (ii) create a well-
           regulated, prudently operating industry. The report presents recommendations to
           address flaws within the current pensions' framework. It concludes by explaining that
           the continued success of the pension industry depends on developments in capital
           markets, public debt management policies, the insurance industry, and interagency
           cooperation-issues    centralto the FSS 2020 agenda.

Insurance Industry Assessment: This report highlights the fact that the Nigerian
insurance market is grossly underdeveloped and consumers are underinsured to a
significant degree. The report suggests enforcing compulsory insurance policies and
cracking down on fake companies as ways to quickly grow the industry. In the
medium term, Nigeria will need to overhaul the accounting and regulatory framework
for the industry, invest in improved IT systems and mount a public awareness
campaign.

Access to Finance: This report identifies key issues for microfinance, branchless
banking and SME finance. There are encouraging signs that access to finance is
poised for growth, but the sector faces regulatory issues. Improved information, the
promotion of creditregistries, adoptinga leasing law and operationalizinga moveable
asset register are recommended as ways of growing access to finance in Nigeria.

Capital Markets: The report highlights the sizeable growth experienced in the capital
market due to structural changes in the financial system. The report suggests that high
cost elements might be preventing more companies from getting listed on the NSE
and impeding the development of an issuer market. Also, the limited supply of
financial instruments restricts investors to follow near identical investment strategies
with    little  opportunity    for   diversification. The    report   concludes    with
recommendationsto address these challenges.

Debt Markets and Debt Management: This report highlights recent improvements in
Government debt management capacity and remaining areas for improvement,
particularly in the areas of strategy development, cash flow forecasting, cash balance
management and developingthe secondary market.

Report on Observance of Standards and Codes for Credit Rights: The report found
that although the Insolvency and Creditor Rights regime of Nigeria is strong in
certain aspects it remains in urgent need of reform. The report concludes that the
principal legislation that drives the legal framework for insolvency and creditor rights
in Nigeria, the Companies and Allied matters Act and the Bankruptcy Act, are both
antiquated and do not incorporate the features of modern international best practices
of insolvency.

Nigeria Investment Climate Assessment 2008: The ICA 2008 was based on a survey
of 2,300 enterprises based in Nigeria. It concluded that Nigerian firms are
unproductive largely due to a lack of electricity, good roads and access to affordable
finance. Each year 16 percent of sales in Nigeria are lost as a result of poor
infrastructure, crime and corruption. Deepening the financial sector would serve to
boost the productivity and performance of Nigerian businesses.

Doing Business in Nigeria 2009: This is part of an annual series of reports that
compares more than 180 countries around the world in terms of the ease of doing
business. The report finds that Nigeria is ranked 11gth - a position that has remained
fairly static over the last few years. Nigeria ranks particularly poorly on registering

          property, dealing with licenses, trading across borders and paying taxes. However, the
          country fairs relatively well in employing workers and protecting investors.

          FSS 2020 Change Management and Implementation Plan: The objectiveof this report
          was to evaluate current/proposed change management approaches for the
          implementation of the FSS 2020 vision. The report reviewed the current change
          architecture for transitioning the FSS 2020 vision and provided recommendations to
           strengthen it. The report concluded by suggesting that for the FSS 2020 vision to be
           successfully implemented, there needs to be a two-pronged change management
           approach working concurrently to engage in changing a large complex system and
           develop institutional capacity.

Public Financial Management

           Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR):
           This report conducted in 2006 proposes actions to promote a sound Public Financial
           Management Environment. The PEMFAR report provides the analytical
          underpinnings for Government's ongoing efforts to address the weaknesses in Public
           Expenditure Management. The report noted that while advances were made in
          macroeconomic and debt management, budget formulation, accounting, and
          procurement reform less progress was made with respect to capacity building,
           including in the Budget Office, and in such areas of financial accountability as
           reporting, monitoring, and disclosure.

           Debt Markets and Debt Management: This report highlights recent improvements in
           Government debt management capacity and remaining areas for improvement.

           Review of capital budget implementation: A recent review of obstacles to the faster
           execution of the capital budget resulted in a number of measures being adopted by the
           Government, including the early release of the capital vote and the swift approval of
           the 2009 budget as well as the introduction of a template for MDA's to monitor and
           evaluate the implementation of capital projects. A summary of the recommendations
           is in Annex 7.

           State-level Public Expenditure Reviews and Public Expenditure and Financial
           Accountability Assessments (PEFA): Several states have already completed Public
           Expenditure reviews and PEFA assessments and use these to inform their reform
           agendas in the public financial management area.

Nigeria's GrowthStrategy

           Employment and Growth Study: Targeted interventions to remove binding constraints
           in employment-intensivevalue chains, in particular in the physical infrastructure area,
          were identified as a key strategy to enhance the employment-intensity of growth in a
          recent study by the Bank on employment and growth. The study found that
          notwithstanding high, sustained growth in the non-oil economy since 2001, the share
           of the population outside the labor force had not declined and that youth

unemployment was on the rise.' To improve the employment intensity of growth it
proposes a number of value chains with high near-term potential for employment
creation.

        ANNEX6:NIGERIA'SFINANCIALSECTORREFORMPROGRAM                          UNDER FSS2020

A. Overview of the Nigerian Financial Sector

1.      Nigeria's financial sector is dominated by domestic commercial banks. The recent
banking consolidation has, on the whole, significantly strengthened the banking sector. Most
banks are well capitalized, liquid and profitable. In the process of meeting the new capital
requirements, banks raised the equivalent of about US$ 3 billion from domestic capital markets
and attracted about US$ 652 million of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into the Nigerian
banking sector.14NPLs are on a declining trend while deposits have grown considerably. The
increased competition among banks arising from the need to deploy their enhanced capital has
led to significant changes in their business models. There has been considerable credit growth
largely to the corporate sector while banks have also been tapping the retail sector including
through their expanded branch network. Some banks have initiated expansions in cross-border
operations, while many have inherited subsidiariesfrom the nonbank sector, strengtheningcross-
border and cross-border linkages.

2.      There is a strong relationship between the financial sector performance and a strong
macroeconomic policy framework. A key risk to the financial sector is a relaxation in fiscal
discipline and complications in monetary management.

3.      A number of features of the financial sector could also pose challenges going forward.
These include: (i) the emergence of large banks with both cross-border and cross-sector
operations in the absence of consolidated supervision; (ii) the considerable growth in credit
provided by the banks; (iii) the size of the banking sector's share on the stock exchange; (iv) the
share of foreign investor presence in the domestic treasury bills and bond markets; and (v) the
strategic risks that banks would be overly eager to deploy capital and deposits into risky
activities. These features raise particular concern and call for policies to ensure that they are not
allowed to undermine the soundness of the financial system. Efforts are being made to mitigate
these risks through a strengthening of the supervisory capacity to monitor the developing
banking system and environment.

4.      Developments in the capital markets have mirrored the structural changes that have taken
place in the financial system. Structural changes in debt management, reforms in the pension
fund industry and the consolidation of the insurance sector have had a significant impact on the
equity and Government bond markets, although the corporate bond market has not seen a
resurgence.

5.      In spite of the overall stability and enhanced performance of the banking system,
financial sector depth and intermediationremain below peer countries and the average for low-
income countries. Capital and asset growth have yet to translate into better access to finance for
SMEs (especially in the manufacturing sector), low-income households and micro enterprises.
Credit remains concentrated in large enterprises. Short loan maturities do not meet the funding
needs for long-term productive investments. The challenge, therefore, will be to overcome the


l4Iweala and Kwaako,Nigeria's Economic Reforms: Progress and Challenges. Brookings InstitutionReport, 2007.

constraints in the lending environment: lack of information about financial health and credit
histories of prospective clients, weak corporate governance, accounting and auditing discourage
financial institutions from expanding their lending business into new market segments.

6.      A key area for further action is the legal and judicial framework for the financial sector.
Strengthened creditor rights and insolvency systems will be necessary to foster greater
confidence in commercial contracts. Lack of secured lending frameworks and high transaction
costs in securing and transferring land titles are a serious impediment for mortgage finance, a key
market for conmercial banks and an important source of SME finance. Private infrastructure
finance will require clear policy and institutional frameworks for private participation in
infrastructure. Positive momentum in the microfinance sector needs to be supported through
adequate supervisory capacity further diagnostic work on the demand for financial services and
the institutional capacity of formal and informal providers to provide adequate supply.

B. Nigeria's Financial SectorReform Strategy

7.      Major reform activities in the financial sector started in 2004 with a 13-point reform
agenda issued by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). It aimed to transform the financial sector
into a growth catalyst, focusing on increasing minimum capitalization for banks to S25 billion
from December 2005. The financial sector reform efforts also witnessed the phased withdrawal
of public sector funds from the banking sector, the adoption of a rule-based regulatory
framework and an automated process for the rendition of returns by banks and other financial
institutions through the enhanced Financial Analysis and Surveillance System (e-FASS). A
number of relevant laws were updated and enforced and the period saw a closer collaboration
with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in the establishment of the
Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), and the enforcement of the anti-money laundering and other
economic crime measures.

8.      As a cornerstone of the 13-point reform agenda, the CBN raised the minimum capital
requirement of banks from $42 billion (US$ 15.4 million) to $425 billion (US$ 192 million) in
June 2004 and banks that could not meet this requirement either merged or had their licenses
revoked. By the end of the consolidation exercise in December 2005, the number of banks had
dropped from 89 to 25. The success of these banking sector reforms together with sound
macroeconomic reforms has created opportunities for improving the availability of finance for
productive investments, including:

        e   Banking consolidation has created banks with a significantly increased capital and
            deposit base which can be leveraged for term finance and outreach. As the largest
            financial market in Africa other than South Africa, Nigeria has significant potential to
            promote financial sector development also on a regional level;

        e   Nigeria is now rated BB- by Standard & Poor's and itch'^;

        e   Total external debt dropped to US$ 3.5 billion in December 2006, compared to US$
            33 billion in 2003;


15Recently, S&P changed its rating outlook fron~stable to negative, but left the rating unchanged at BB-.

                                                        78

             In 2004 a new regulatory framework for the pelision system was introduced with the
             establishmentof a strong regulator, the Pension Commission, and the pension system
             for public sector employees was changed fiom a defined benefit to a funded defined
             contribution system. Pension funds are now worth an estimated $4300 billion (US$
             2.5 billion), with a projected annual growth rate of 15percent; and

             In early 2007, one Nigerian bank issued over-subscribed bonds in the international
             markets without guarantees from any Government or multilateral agency. In addition,
              several other Nigerian banks have accessed several tens of millions of United States
             dollars in lines of credit fiom international financial institutions without Government
              guarantees.

                   Source: CBN, SEC, NSE, World Bank and Pencom.


21.     Notwithstanding the tremendous successes achieved under the CBN's 13-point agenda,
the Nigerian authoritieswere cognizant of the need to strengthenfurther the financial sector and
in 2006 embarked on the development a comprehensive, long-term, strategic plan for the
development of the financial sector - the Financial System Strategy 2020 (FSS 2020). The FSS
2020 steering committee defined the vision for the strategy as follows: "To be the safest and
fastest growingfinancial system amongst emerging market countries".

22.      The strategy aims to build on the success of the recent banking sector reforms to promote
greater stability, depth and diversity for the entire financial system. It covers all priority areas of
the financial system. The World Bank, FIRST, IMF and IFC have supported the formulation of
FSS 2020 with substantivetechnical assistance.Nevertheless, it remains a home grown approach
and is fully owned by the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance.

C. The FSS 2020 Framework for Financial SectorReforms

23.     The process ~f putting together FSS 2020 was highly consultative involving
representativesof all the regulators, industry participants, academics, donors etc. From the outset
'focus groups' were organized for various sub-sectors16.They met regularly and their findings
were reported and discussed at a series of retreats culminating in an international conference held
in June 2007 opened by the President, which provided an official endorsement to the vision


l6 Namely, capital markets, housing finance, regulation and legal framework, insurance market, credit market, SME finance,
money and FOREX markets, monetary policy, IT and communications and human capital as well as quality assurance.

outlined in FSS 2020. Subsequentlythe Bank worked closely with the CBN to undertake M e r
diagnostic work to set the baseline and develop an implementable roadmap for FSS 2020
focusing on such areas as: banking sector, payments and remittances, debt management and debt
market development, capital markets, insurance, pensions, housing finance and social housing,
SME access to finance, microfinance, corporate governance, and creditor rights & corporate
insolvency.
24.    In each area, experts drafted concise papers identifying the key challenges to achieving
the FSS 2020 vision and outlining practical, time-bound steps for overcoming them. In many
cases, the papers have been discussed at length by industry stakeholders convened under the
rubric of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) FSS 2020 Working Groups.

25.    In an effort to maintain a results-oriented focus, support was also provided in assisting
the CBN in putting together a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework for FSS 2020 and
advising the project implementation unit-housed      (temporarily) by the CBN-in   organizing the
envisaged transition to an implementation office referring to the Steering Committee to be
appointed by the President.

26.     Crucial to the success of FSS 2020 so far is that the strategy and process have all along
been owned and managed by the Nigerian authorities. In supporting the authorities in moving
FSS 2020 from the drawing board to implementation the Bank has broadened its involvement
beyond providing technical support to supporting the complex change management challenge.
This support to FSS 2020 has been greatly appreciated by Nigerian stakeholders, and the
Nigerian authorities have managed to make significant gains in the area of financial sector
reforms which are elaborated in the following section.

D. Nigeria's Financial SectorReform Program in Detail

27.     As explained above, the Central Bank of Nigeria has been driving an ambitious program
of reforms in the Financial Sector for many years. The CBN together with the Federal Ministry
of Finance and other financial sector regulators and stakeholders intend to pursue this reform
program over the medium term. An overview of plans in the following subsectors is provided
below;

            Enhanced Access to Finance for SMEs;

            Increasing Access to Finance for the Poor;

            Strengtheningthe Environment for Financial SectorDeepening;

            Developing Capital Markets to Fund Medium and Long Term Development; and

            StrengtheningPensions Systems.

E. Enhanced Access to Finance by Small and Medium Enterprises

28.     Suggested outcome goal: Increase the percentage of small and medium-sized firms with
lines of creditor loans from financial institutionsfrom 5 percent in 2007 to 10percent by 2012.

29.     Issues: Tighter monetary conditions since the onset of the international financial crisis
have resulted in less access to credit for small and medium enterprises. In this situation banks
prefer to reduce their risks by focusing on lending to domestic top-tier corporations. Banks have
increasingly also been able to engage in lending to multi-nationals whose access to foreign
markets is impacted by the tightening of credit conditions abroad.

30.     In 2007, only 5 percent of Nigeria's small and medium enterprises (SMEs) had access to
loans or lines of credit, while more than 80 percent reported they would like to have access to
these financial instr~ments.'~SMEs report access to finance as the third most important obstacle
to doing business after the lack of access to electricity and good roads. Given the potential that
SMEs have in boosting growth and employment, Nigeria can gain substantially by improving
their access to finance. SME finance is constrained by lack of data, inadequate regulations and
infrastructure for collateral registration and insufficient credit information. Regulations require
loans to be collateralized, limit the types of acceptable collateral and impose a complex and
expensive system of registration charges. At the same time the laws relating to security over
movables (i.e. equipment) are antiquated, fragmented and do not offer Nigerian businesses an
effective means of raising capital.

31.     Furthermore, the lack of a fully functioning credit information system is not conduciveto
increased access to finance for the SME sector. However, with quick approval of well designed
regulations, Nigeria could establish a competitive and open credit information industry where
private credit bureaus work alongside the CBN's Credit Risk Management System (CRMS).

32.     Financial providers are challengedto offer adequate servicesto SMEs. Checks, which are
normally used as security in suppliercredit (particularly in developing nations), have a very poor
reputation in Nigeria. As a result, checks are not considered reliable and hence do not function as
credit or collateral. There are few financial products tailored to SMEs. Globally, leasing is a
widely-used service for SMEs, although the lack of a leasing law in Nigeria is constraining
development of this sector in the country. Finance companies have limited tools for credit risk
assessment and lack of information and understanding of value chains that are important in the
developmentof factoring services.

33.     Past attempts to promote SME finance have not been successful, and this could lead
authorities (and skeptical banks) to be hesitant in implementing new policies for the sector. Five
venture capital companies were established to manage a publicly funded fund to support the
sector, the Small and Medium Enterprises Equity Investment Scheme (SMEEIS). Their
experience offer strong indications for how to further support the development of SME finance,
given that they are still operational and have valuable experience and understanding of the
sector.

34.     Reform Strategy to Reach Outcome Goal: The following are suggested reform actions
that have been discussedwith the relevantNigerian stakeholders:

          Adoption of steps to enhance credit information systems. In October 2008, the CBN
          issued licensing guidelines for credit bureaus in Nigeria ("Credit Bureau
          Guidelines"), which are well designed and should pave the way for development of a
          competitive credit information system. The CBN currently maintains a credit
          information system, the Credit Risk Management System (CRMS), with both positive
          and negative data and a profile on the total liabilities a debtor has acquired within the
          banking system. A total of four private companies of significantsize (and as many as
          four others) are cwrently working on credit bureau initiatives in Nigeria. These
          actionshave created a framework for an improved credit risk management system.

          Improved collection and dissemination of data by SMEDAN, CAC, CBN and other
          relevant stakeholders regarding SME finance. In order to adequately set policy and to
          have a baseline against which results can be compared, data needs to be collected and
           made available to relevant policy making agencies, private sector, industry
           associations, and the broad public. For that purpose, the CBN could expand open item
           code 10860of the Monthly Statement of Assets and Liabilities(MBR 300) to include
           lending products such as leasing, factoring and loans under credit lines issued to
           SMEs. The CBN could also begin to classifythe SME data by type of loan, loan size,
           company size, and economic sector based on the additional SME information
          provided by financial intermediaries and make the aggregate data (sum total for all
           financial institutions) public via the CBN website and its reports. The Company
           Affairs Commission (CAC) can also play a crucial role in improving SME data by
           making more widely available the database that it manages on companies and
           business names and the information that it collects on annual financial returns for all
           companies.

           Adoption of steps to enhance collateral registration to reduce the costs and risks of
           lending. The CAC plans to adopt regulations that permit registration of individual
           items of property as collateral. Currently, it manages a workable registry of floating
           claims on company assets, but the registry does not identify individual assets, and
           only incorporated businesses can make use of it. Plans to develop a computerized
           movable collateral registry are also crucial to reduce the costs and delays attendant on
           registering mortgages and liens. The creation of computerized land registers presents
           significanttechnical and legal problems (partly due to the uncertainties of title created
           by customary ownership laws). Further study of how other African countries are
           resolving these problems may provide useful inputs into designing a computerization
           strategy.

F. Increasing accessto financefor the poor

35.    Suggested outcome goal: To increase the proportion of the adult population (those that
are eighteen and over) that uses formal financial sector services from 21 percent to 40 percent by
2012.

36.      Issues: A recent study revealed that only 21 percent of Nigerian adults have access to
formal sector financial services.''        The unbanked are predominantly rural, female, from
subsistence farming backgrounds and more likely to be living in the North West part of the
country. Access to finance for such vulnerable groups is seen as key to unlocking growth for
poor farming communities. A comparative analysis of the growth rates of different countries
over a 30-year period has produced convincing evidence that a deeper financial system
contributes to growth-and         is not merely a reflection of prosperity.1gCountries with deep
financial systems also exhibit lower incidences of poverty than others at the same level of
national income.

         I. Nigeria has developed a strategy to deepen access tofiance

37.      Nigeria's authorities recognize the need to develop and deepen the Nigerian financial
sector. As described above, the Central Bank took the lead with the 13-point agenda that was
implemented starting in 200415 and more recently with the Financial System Strategy 2020
(FSS2020). The reform teams have committed to ambitioustargets with the CBN publicly stating
that: "By 2020, the Nigerian credit to GDP ratio will be among the top three of emerging
markets, including access to creditfor the productive SME sub-sector and 70% of the Nigerian
population. " This goal addresses documented needs. Sixty one percent of the unbanked state that
they wish to have access to formal sector financial services. However, the strategy is also
confronted by a number of challenges.

38.       The primary challenge is how to provide services to the poor on a financially viable and
sustainable basis. Nigeria has a long history of community finance, microfinance and SME
finance initiatives aimed at providing services to the unbanked population. However, their
performance has been at best mixed. Nigerian authorities are learning from the past and moving
rapidly to put in place a raft of new legislation as well as improving on existing acts and
regulations. Given Nigeria's geographic size and development status, successfblly expanding
access to finance is likely to involve innovative new access technologies such as branchless
banking.

          2. Developing a commercial microfnance sector

39.       The CBN launched the Microfinance Policy, Regulatory and Supervisory Framework for
Nigeria in 2005. It was an important turning point for the industry as it established the
Microfinance Bank (MFB) as an institutional vehicle for privately-owned deposit-taking
microfinance institutions.Following the establishment of the new regulatory framework, several
projects (including an IDA-IFC supported operation focusing on MSME development) have
succeeded in demonstrating that commercially sustainable,professional microfinance institutions
can operate and thrive in Nigeria's wbm and pesi-urban areas.

40.       The microfinance policy has been successfbl in catalyzing capital investments by a large
number of Nigerian and international investors in the newly created MFBS.~'The new MFBs


18Finscope study carried out by Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFinA) in 2008.
l9Making Finance Work for Africa, Patrick Honohan and ThorstenBeck, 2007.
20It is estimatedthat more than US$ 50m has been raised to support newly created MFBs since 2005.

have enjoyed a remarkable rate of growth. At the same time the new policy has inadvertently
created conditions that have the potential to undermine the performance of the sector.

41.     Low capital requirements to operate an MFB (currently N20million or US$ 150,000)
have permitted a large number of undercapitalized and weak institutionsto remain in the market.
It has also not provided an incentive for MFBs to merge and thereby create the economies of
scale that would be needed to effectively install IT platforms, provide training to credit officers
and have the available capital to expand effectively. The microfinance policy also imposes
relatively high capital requirements for a state-wide MFB license (341 billion or US$ 7.5
million). This has resulted in 98.9 percent of MFBs licensed as single units. It also provides a
strong incentive for MFBs to locate in the South West in and around Lagos, the financial hub,
rather than moving to underserved areas. The geographical restrictions also impede beneficial
specialization. Finally the rapid growth rates have undermined the ability of many MFBs to
manage growth resulting in reduced asset quality.

42.     The lack of readily accessible market and financial institution performance data
undermines evidence-based decision making for all stakeholders including policy-makers,
regulators, investors, MFB managers and the public. This coupled with the lack of apex
institutions has led to irrational growth of the sector. With over 1,000 MFBs to oversee, central
bank capacity to regulate the sector is also stretched. While not creating systemic risks for the
sector, as the MFBs only account for 1 percent of system assets, supervision of such a large
number of institutionspresents a considerable challengeto the CBN and detractsfrom the CBNYs
focus on supervisingthe 24 large commercialbanks.
        3. Usingbranchlessbankingto reach thepoor

43.     Branchless banking involves the delivery of financial services through agents andlor new
technologies to reach under-served populations. It has a transformation potential to expand
access to finance by reducing the cost and increasingthe points of service, especially in the rural
areas. Nigeria's mobile phone sector has grown at a phenomenal rate exceeding 30 percent per
annum in recent years. It is estimatedthat more than 50 percent of the population has access to a
mobile phone and more than 40 percent of those are in the rural areas. Nigeria can benefit greatly
by learning from and implementing solutionsthat have successfullybeen implemented in Kenya,
Brazil, the Philippinesand elsewhere.

44.     In Nigeria the main payment instruments available include credit transfers, checks,
electronic debits and payment card systems. Electronic purses (a form of stored value cards),
internet-based banking along with mobile payment services have recently been introduced.
Increasing branchless banking in Nigeria will require increasing the relevant infrastructure
especially the point of sales (POS) terminals and introducing conducive mobile payments
guidelinesto promote branchless banking.

45.     At the moment Nigeria has one of the lowest penetration rates of POS even when
compared to other African countries. The ATM infrastructure is dramatically hindered by
legislation that does not encourage sharing of facilities. This results in a situation in which there
are multiple ATM machines at the same location which is a waste of resources on much needed
infrastructure that could be used to increase penetration of financial services.

46.     The Central Bank is in the process of drafting mobile payments guidelines to promote
branchless banking. It is expected that the ,legislation will cover anti-money laundering ,and
combating the financing of terrorism (AMLICFT) requirements as well as consumer protection.
The CBN is working with a variety of stakeholders such as switch operators, mobile phone
companies and others to ensure that the guidelines that emerge will be practical and
developmental in nature.

         4. Financing Social ~ o u s i n ~ ~ l

47.      It is estimated that Nigeria's housing shortfall is in excess of 17million units. While only
21 percent of the Nigerian population has access to formal sector finance, less than 0.5 percent of
the population has access to housing finance. This number represents a very small elite. Even in
urban areas more than 85 percent of the population rents, often spending over 40 percent of their
income in the process. The failures in the rental framework leave them with a lack of security
and without any choice but to accept such market practices as paying 2 years rent in advance.
Landlords cannot take all the blame though as the current framework provides them with very
little protection and makes it prohibitively expensive to evict a tenant, as well as taking close to 2
years to accomplish. A balanced approach is needed which will improve affordability for renters
and provide the right inducements for landlords to invest more heavily into good rental
accommodation.
48.      The alternative solution in more rural areas or peri-urban areas is self-construction. This
is typically slow, inefficient and does not produce good quality housing. Housing microfinance
could help lower income households buy building materials in bulk, pay for title regularization,
and pay for an expansion or an improvement to an existing dwelling. Yet virtually none of the
700 Micro-Finance Banks or other providers of micro-finance loans have yet to engage in
housing micro-finance in any meaningful way. The contrast with South America is stark, where
this product has enjoyed widespread success and has helped improve countless lives in slum
areas. The potential is there, if steps are taken to create the right environment and to foster the
introduction of housing micro-finance into Nigeria.

49.      Nigerian developers currently focus almost entirely on high-end, high margin
developments since financing housing is an expensive and risky proposition. Due to widespread
public sector failures they are often forced to provide all the required infrastructure such as
roads, drainage and electricity. Nigerian banks do not provide products suited to the extreme
cash-flow patterns that developers' experience. Government can play a role in encouraging
developers to go down market by providing infrastructure and developing public-private
partnerships for the constructionof affordable housing estates. A unified approach is needed that
brings together the Federal Housing Authority (FHA), the National Social Insurance Trust Fund
(NSTIF), and the State Housing Corporations. It is also important to broaden the current agenda
away from mortgages alone to make housing finance more relevant to lower income households.

50.      One of the most important sources of finance for the housing sector, the Urban
Development Bank of Nigeria has recently been re-structured and is under new management.
This institution's main objectives are to structure deals and finance infrastructure for the housing
sector, by providing sub-debt and therefore making infrastructure investment more attractive for

21Housing Finance for the Poor, Simon Walley March 2009 unpublished mimeo.

commercial banks. Despite the successfhl restructuring, the implementation of new activities by
the Urban Development Bank needs to be accelerated. One of the major constraints on
developers in producing large-scale affordable housing is the cost of infrastructure which at the
moment falls entirely on the developer. Constitutionally it is local Governments which should
provide water and sewerage services as well as access roads. The Urban Development Bank is
looking to facilitate this by providing 'mezzanine' finance which would help local Government
in financing infrastructure and would effectively provide a credit enhancement for banks to
participate in loan syndication.

51.    Reform strategy to reach the outcome goal: : The following are suggested reform
actionsthat have been discussedwith the relevant Nigerian stakeholders:

            Improving microfinance penetration and coverage: The CBN is considering (a)
            publishing historical information including financial statements, outreach and
            performance data as well as interest rates for all MFBs on the CBN website, (b)
            prioritizing supervision efforts on the largest MFBs and develop off and on-site
            supervision tools and training programs, (c) moving towards a revision of the
            regulatory framework for MFB's involving higher minimum capital requirements for
            unit MFBs and allowing mergers and acquisitionswithout geographic restrictions and
            (d) aligning all MFB wholesale lending programs with a market-based model for
            pricing and eligibilityrequirements.

            Promoting branchless banking initiatives: The CBN will promote the interoperability
            of the retail payments system. It will also ensure that the mobile payments guidelines
            address (a) key issues such as the use of agents and/or third party service providers
            and (b) prudential risks involved in nonbank-led models of mobile banking.

            Financing Social Housing: The Federal Government of Nigeria will commission a
            detailed diagnostic study on Nigeria's private rental housing market. It will set up a
            working group to prepare recommendations on real estate development finance and it
            will clarify and develop the regulatory framework for Housing Micro-finance. In the
            longer term Government is also planning to (a) develop a REITS framework, (b)
            createa framework for Housing Public Private Partnership Schemes and (c) introduce
            a more coordinated and inclusive Housing Policy.


        5. Strengthening the Enabling Environmentfor Financial Sector Deepening

52.    Suggested outcome goal: To develop secure and efficient payment and remittances
systems so that the proportion of non-cash payments rises from X percent to Y percent and the
costs of remittances are reduced from 8 percent to 4 percent or less for firms covering 80 percent
of the market 2012.

53.    Issues: There is a significantpositive correlationbetween improved payment systems and
credit to the private sector. Having a good retail payments system, a range of payment
instruments and a higher degree of interoperability of retail payment systems will facilitate
commerce and trade. Remittances (funds sent by migrant workers to their families back home)

represent a significant and growing proportion of GDP and export earnings. Annual remittances
to Nigeria are through official channels are estimated at US$ 4.5 billion while estimates of total
remittances sent to Nigeria are as high as US$ 10 billion. Remittances help to smooth
consumption, stimulate investment and act as an important counter-cyclical safety net for the
poor. There is also strong evidence that reducing the fees on remittances encourages remitters to
send the fknds through formal channels and provides the receivers with an incentive to open a
bank account.22Nigeria has embarked on ambitious programs to improve the country's payment
system and reduce fees for remittances.

                6. Improving Nigeria's Payments System

54.     The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has embarked on a comprehensive reform of the
national payment system that will significantly modernize payment transactions in line with
international standards and best practices. The vision of the Nigerian authorities is to create an
electronic payments infrastructure that is nationally utilized and internationally recognized as
being world class.

55.     The CBN recognizes that certain payments system improvements will not take place
without its leadership. The CBN's goal is to achieve high quality, reliable and affordable
payment systems thereby increasing confidence in the banking system, achieving greater use of
banking services in all geographic locations, and reducing Nigerians' dependency on cash and
checks. It is also spearheading the implementation of a central switch to achieve interoperability
for the card-based systems in Nigeria. In 2006, the CBN commissioned a real-time gross
settlement (RTGS) system which it owns and operates. The RTGS system was implementedwith
the primary aim of reducing risk and enhancing efficiency in the payment systems.

56.     Although a systemically important payment system, the RTGS system does not currently
meet international standards for risk mitigation and efficiency and does not meet the needs of
users. The provision and repayment of intraday liquidity is not automated in the RTGS system.
Because the processes are manual and administrativelyburdensome, intraday credit entries, once
booked are not always reversed in a timely way. The spillover of intraday credit into overnight
lending may therefore compromise the CBN's management of monetary policy. The necessary
connectivity between the banks' internal banking systems and the RTGS systemhas not yet been
implemented and straight-through-processing is therefore not achievable. Banks are unable to
promote RTGS use for third party payments as, without the necessary connectivity,they lack the
capacity to process large volumes of these payments through this system. Additionally, the
RTGS system is not effectively linked to the central settlement and clearing systen1's (CSCS)

57.     Electronic depository for securities. One of the consequences of the foregoing is that
checks remain the primary payment meanstfor large-value payments, including settling securities
trades. And check usage continues to expand, despite the existence of the RTGS system. Checks
currently account for over 90 percent of non-cash payments in Nigeria.

58.     The use of electronic payment instnunents, in particular debit and credit cards, in Nigeria
and by Nigerians abroad is constrainedby the perception of corruption and a generalized fear of

fraud, misuse, or loss. It is reported that the international card issuers (Visa and Mastercard in
particular) often block, or refuse to pay, even genuine transactions as a precautionary measure
against misuse. Nigeria has three private switch operators that are not interoperable. Currently
banks compete on the branding and deployment of ATMs and they acknowledge that the non-
collaborative and competitive approach they now take to the deployment of ATMs results in a
less than optimal distribution of ATMs and is not cost-effective.

59.     In this regard, the CBN, jointly with the banks, is currently implementing a central
switch, which will be operated by the Nigerian Inter Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), to
achieve interoperability among all the card-based systems in Nigeria. Such interoperability is a
critical prerequisite for the effective distribution of ATMs and POS terminals throughout the
country (currently multiple ATMs are positioned side-by-side in a single location, while other
areas remain under-served).

60.      Securities settlement systems are an integral part of the national payment system and are
critical to the effective functioning and development of the capital market. Equally, the interbank
money market is critical in an environment in which large value payments are settled in a gross
system as higher levels of liquidity are then needed. Currently, the CBN acts as registrar for
Government securities while the CSCS operates the central securitiesdepository.

61.      The secondary market for Government securities has recorded significant growth over the
years and now averages an estimated 866 trillion annually. The CSCS reports average daily bond
trades of $425to 8630 billion through the existing securities depository. Trades are done over-the-
counter with cash settlement mainly by check. The Money Market Dealers Association and
CSCS are jointly implementing a trading platform for Government securities, even while the
Ministry of Finance and the Debt Management Office are reported to be moving towards the
implementation of a new trading platform. It is important that these initiatives be coordinated.

                 7. Reducing the cost of Remittances to Nigeria

62.      International remittances amounted to about US$ 4.2 billion (7 percent of GDP) in 2006,
through 700,000 transactions, an increase of about 30 percent over 2005. However, informal
remittance flows into Nigeria are thought to be large, with much hand carrying of cash. Including
infornlaltransfers, total remittance inflowsmight be as large as US$ 10billion.

63.      In terms of geographical coverage, disbursement of remittances is restricted to bank
branches. This means that some recipients have to travel lon distances to collect their money.
About 35 percent of bank branches are in Lagos and Abuja!              The requirement that only banks
serve as agents of remittance companies, coupled with the imposition of exclusivity contracts by
international money transfer operators, has resulted in a near monopolistic situation, with high
commission rates. This provides an incentive for people to transfer cash using informal channels.
Western Union charges approximately 7 percent of the principal sum to send money to Nigeria.
This is significantly more than in other large markets where a competitive situation has

Nigeria." USAID, October, 2007.

developed. In the Mexico-US corridor, for example, where many players compete, the average
cost is between 3 and 4 percent of the sum transferred. Unlike in other countries global
remittance service providers are not required to be licensed or regulated in Nigeria.

64.    Late in 2008, the CBN outlawed exclusivity arrangements between banks and remittances
services providers in order to open the market to potential new entrants and thereby bring down
the cost of remittances. The CBN is working to encourage increased transparency in remittance
services, by requiring the publishing of the fee schedule at both ends as well as the exchange
rates, margins, time taken to make the transfer and specific locations of access points in both the
sending and receiving countries. Appropriate consumer protection is also important. Senders
should have rights including error dispute resolution.

65.    Reform strategy to reach the outcome goal: The payment system strategy seeks to
promote confidence in, and usage of, electronic payment instrunlents that are safe. It also
pron~otesthe adoption of internationally accepted standards that encourage interoperability and
straight-through-processing for payment service providers and users, to minimize end-to-end
costs and error rates and prevent or detect fraud. The remittance strategy seeks to reduce the cost
and increase the transparency of the market for remittances in Nigeria. Achieving these goals
will require progress in the following areas:

            Upgrading the RTGS system: The system functionality should include straight-
            through-processing connectivity to the banks' systems as well as to CBN's to
            automate intraday liquidity management-lending,           collateral management, and
            repayment. Straight-through-processing removes reliance on manual processes,
            reduces operational risk, and facilitates third party payments by banks on behalf of
            their customers. Ultimately it will support greater use of the RTGS system and more
            efficient management of intraday liquidity. A multi-functional payment system with
            interfaces to the regional payment system to be developed for the West Africa
            Monetary Zone for cross-border payments will also be important as will a linkage to
            the central securities depository for the settlement of securities market transactions on
            a delivery versus payment basis.

        * Impose check limits: Determine check limits based on an analysis of check usage
            trends and impose cap on checks jointly with a system of penalties and incentives to
            promote use of the RTGS system. This will facilitate the desired migration from
            checks to the RTGS system. This exercise may also be expanded to include a
            simulation of the impact of the check limits on banks' multilateral net settlement
            positions. This will inform the extent of collateral (guarantee fund, for example) that
            may be required to guarantee settlement of automated clearing house files in the
            RTGS system. This would obviate the need for an arbitrary or excessive requirement
            for collateral from the respective banks.

            Improve system integration: It is recommended that CBN oversee and coordinate
            with the Ministry of Finance and the dealers the implementation of the trading
            platform for secondary market transactions. Automating the interfaces between the
            RTGS system, the trading platform and the electronic depository will support

           efficient trade initiation and the settlement of securities market transactions on a
            delivery versus payment basis.

           Promote uptake and interoperability of card services: The CBN is working to
            encourage payment service providers to collaborate to increase ATM and POS
            ownership, improve the interoperability of ATM and POS terminals (through the
            implementation of the central switch as planned) and rationalize their deployment
            throughout the country. The aim is to achieve the widest distribution of these units to
            the rural unbanked and achieve greater use of banking services and an expansion of
            the customer base for the banking system as a whole. This process can be supported
            by joint promotional campaigns to encourage the use (by consumers) and acceptance
            (by merchants) of cards and other electronic payment instruments.

            Liberalizing the market for incoming Nigerian remittances: The CBN has recently
            moved to liberalize the market banning the exclusivity arrangements between banks
            and remittance service companies thereby allowing the entry of new non-bank
            players. It is expected that this will generate significant benefits including reducing
            the cost of remittances. The use of non-bank agents as distribution points will extend
            geographical coverage of payout points, especially in rural areas. It will also
            encourage a greater proportion of the remittance flows currently moving through the
            informal market to switch to the formal market. This will increase the security of the
            transfers and enable improved data collection. Making continued progress on this
            agenda will require cooperation among a range of Nigerian authorities led by the
            CBN.

                8.Developing capital markets tofund medium and long-term development

66.     Suggested outcome goal: (i) Increased market activity with equity trading volume
increasing to 34500 billion in 2012 from 34138.1 billion in 2007; (ii) Increase in market
capitalization as percent of GDP. (iii) Increase in number of listed companies from 212 in 2008
to 220 in 2012 (iv) Increase in the average number of corporate bond issuance from 1.5 during
1999-2007 to 3 in 2012; (iv) Increased efficiency of Government bond market with an increase
in the value of secondary market trading.

67.     Issues: The Nigerian equity market has experienced growth due to structural changes in
the financial system. In part this reflects increases in the minimum capital requirements in the
banking and insurance sectors. In part as an outcome of the rapid growth in new issuances the
Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) became one of the most over-valued exchanges in the world in
early 2008. Banks and insurance companies accounted for 19 of the top 20 companies by
turnover volume. To a large extent, growth in the financial sector drove much of the 75 percent
appreciation in the NSE All-Share Index in 2007. This was partially fuelled by the practice of
lending against share purchases by the banks. However, since March 2008, the stock market has
witnessed a sharp decline with the Nigeria All Share Index losing more than 60 percent of its
value. The correction (from very high PIE ratios) was triggered inter alia by foreign investor
withdrawal owing to distress in international financial markets, and led to margin calls and
increases in required collateral,precipitatingfurther declines.

68.     The high costs of issuance and trading curtails the interest of more companies from
listing on the NSE and stifles liquidity. The number of listed companies grew only from 195 to
213 during 2002-08. The overwhelming majority of IPOs in recent years have been in the
banking sector. Therefore, the key driver of growth on the NSE have been changes in regulation
(that is, raising capital requirements for banks and insurance companies) which have led to
public offerings in an effort to satisfy the new minimum capital requirements.

69.     Although fees relating to initial public offerings (IPOs) and trading were reduced in
September 2008, they are still much higher than average transaction costs in other emerging
markets. Recently, the registrar has been under heavy criticism, with many market participants
viewing it as a bottleneck to IPOs. The problem stems from lack of capacity in the industry to
handle an increase in the number of IPOs and particularly the large number of small retail
investors that now subscribeto them.

70.     The governance of the NSE-the          main stock exchange in Nigeria-is       in need of
strengthening. The NSE is currently a traditional self regulated organization, owned by its
memberslbrokers. As in all such structures, there is the risk that (a) self-regulation is
compromised by members and management failing to act in the public interest, and (b)
management becomes entrenched. Measures to improve governance around the world have
involved strengthening Government oversight, demutualizing the exchange, and separating the
self-regulatory function from the trading function. Demutualizing the NSE and creating a self-
regulated organization (SRO) would be appropriate to reduce conflicts of interest and improve
oversight.

71.     The Nigerian capital markets and their participants are regulated by a patchwork of
institutions with uneven powers, competence, and status. The SEC regulates capital markets
under the 1999 Investment and Securities Act (last amended in 2007). The NSE regulates its
members. The National Pension Commission (PENCOM) regulates the pension industry. The
National Insurance Commission (NAICOM). regulates the insurance industry. The Debt
Management Office (DMO) regulates both the primary and the secondary market for
Government debt. Efforts are underkay to strengthen the coordinatingbody for regulators of the
financial services industry-the        Financial Services Regulatory Coordinating Committee
(FSRCC). The authorities recognize the need for stronger cooperation among regulators,
particularly as the financial industry has moved to conglomerate structures. In addition, increased
regulatory focus on risk-based methods of regulation and supervisionis taking place.

72.     There is a scarcity of skilled human resources both in the securities industry and among
regulators. The creation of new regulators (which attracted scarce staff from other regulatory
bodies), the establishment of the new pension fund industry (which attracted manpower from the
small mutual fund industry), and more generally the drive to expamd into new products and
markets by the newly consolidated banking sector has exposed the shortage of skills in the new
environment.

73.     Reform strategy to reach the outcome goal: A successfulreform strategy for this sector
would include progress onthe following key issues:

              Significant reduction in IPO and trading fees by SEC: The SEC, NSE, and market
              players reduced the fees relating to initial public offerings (IPOs) and trading in
              September 2008. The costs of an IPO was trimmed from roughly 4.5 percent to 3.2
             percent (excluding underwriting). The costs of trading were cut from 2.5 percent to
              2.0 percent (sell-side), and from 2.3 percent to 1.8percent (buy-side).Although more
              still needs to be done in reducing issuance costs, given the impediments that high
              issuance costs are posing to the IPO market, the September 2008 reduction in costs is
              an important step towards enhancingthe depth and liquidity in the market. The recent
              change in SEC regulations permitting issuance of shares through book building,
              eliminatingthe need for underwriting, is also a positive step in this direction.

              Strengthen registrar infrastructure and move towards mandatory dematerialization of
              certificates: The SEC has taken a number of steps to strengthen the registrar
              infrastructure that includes: (a) issuing a deadline for complaintsregarding unfinished
              settlements of subscriber cases; (b) forbidding registrars to be registrars for affiliated
              companies; (c) raising the minimum capital requirement; (d) demanding that the
             registrars upgrade their procedures and use modern technology; and (e) making it
             mandato2yfor new IPOs to be fully dematerialized in the Nigerian central depository
              (CSCS).

             Publication of rules on market makers and adoption of plan for their registration: The
              SEC is working on establishing capital requirements and other regulations for
             upcoming market maker schemes for equity trading on the NSE. In addition, the
             establishment of formalized borrowingllendingarrangementsis being considered.

             Adoption of plan to transition to IFRS: For accounting and reporting, the SEC stands
             firmly in favor of adoption of the International Financial Reporting System rather
             than the adaptation of the rules. While there is discussion as to whether to adapt
             international financial reporting system standards, rather than fully adopting them,
             adoption will ensure that the accounting system for Nigerian banks and corporations
             moves efficiently to international standards and that these entities and the accounting
             profession reap the full benefits arising from international recognition of the
             improvements achieved by adherence to international accounting and disclosure
             standards.

                  9. Developing and expanding the GovernmentDebt Market

74.     Issues: The Nigerian Government debt market has developed at a remarkablespeed since
reforms started in 2003 and the main building blocks for a second phase of the reform are
already in place. The primary market has developed soundly according to best international
practices. This has included regular auction calendars, lengthening of the average maturity of
outstanding debt, issuance of Federal Government (FGN) Bonds of standard maturitiesfrom 3 to
20 years and a primary dealerlmarket maker scheme. The challenge now, as already envisaged



24  But even new public offerings may become rematerialized fiom CSCS at the shareholdersrequest as company
law gives the shareholdera right to demand paper based certificates.

                                                       92

by the DMO, is to consolidate market benchmarks for T-Bonds proactively managing tlie
outstandingdebt portfolio and to increase liquidity in the secondary market.

75.     The secondarymarket is still incipient given that most of its reforms date only from 2006,
but has been growing significantly. However, most market participants point to lack of
secondary market prices and low competition under the primary dealers scheme as the main
problems. Success will depend on the combined efforts of the DMO, the CBN, the SEC, the
CSCS and market participants. Collaborative efforts in such areas as issuance policy,
development of the money market and investment in market infrastructure will all impact the
level of secondarymarket activity.

76.     The development of a diversified investor base is a key challenge in Nigeria. However,
this diversification is unlikely to be achieved to its full potential until secondary market issues
concerning transparency and competition are addressed. These are major concerns for the
growing pension fund industry. Nigeria's settlementinfrastructurehas not developed at the same
pace as other areas in debt markets. Shortcomings include the institutional split between the
CBN for T-Bills and CSCS for T-Bonds. Currently an interagency group is working on
upgrading some criticalareas, such as connectivitybetween CBN and CSCS. A clearer definition
of the institutional organization (CBN and CSCS responsibilities and governance arrangements)
of the clearing and settlementinfrastructurefor T-Bills and T-~ondsare alsorequired.

77.     Market developments have been so fast and recent that there are regulatory gaps or
overlaps that need to be addressed in four areas in particular. First, the responsibilities of the
different supervisors need to be defined in a context of financial intermediaries taking new roles
and risks as debt market intermediaries. Second,there is a need to develop supervision of market
conduct and trading systems that applies to markets in both private and Government securities,
including regulations on pre- or post-trading price dissemination for OTC markets. Third, the
legal framework needs to be developed for more sophisticated market activity and products,
including repos, short selling and their supporting settlement infrastructure and risk management
schemes. Finally, more specific regulations are needed on fixed income mutual funds, especially
money market mutual funds.

78.     Reform strategy to reach the outcome goal: The reform strategy to develop the
Government debt market, currently being considered by Nigerian authorities includes:

            DM0 to develop and adopt an action plan to enhance efficiency and liquidity in
            Government debt market: The DM0 intends to focus on (i) rep0 markets; (iii)
            secondary markets; (iv) C&S infrastructure; (v) investor base and (vi) regulatory
            framework for debt markets. The specific priority areas that have been identified for
            support are (i) liability management of transactions relating to issued government
            debt: buy backs and switches; (ii) revision of arrangements for primary dealers to
            increase competition; (iii) rep0 markets and securities lending: standardization of
            business rules, collateral valuation, tax and accounting standards and prudential
            regulations and clearing and settlement requirements; (iv) clearing and settlement
            infrastructure:strategic decisions and upgrades.

                10.Strengthening insurancefor better risk management

79.     Suggested outcome goal: (i) Annual insurance premiums grow from approximatelyW 6
billion in 2008 to W180 billion in 2012; and (iii) Annual auto claims payout as a proportion of
premium rises from 15percent in 2007 to 40 percent in 2012.

80.     Issues: At present, the Nigerian insurance industry is underdeveloped relative to
comparable emerging nations. The industry has not grown in the last 35 years in inflation-
adjusted terms. Consumers are relatively uneducated on the benefits of purchasing insurance
products, and many informed policy holders have doubts whether their claims will in fact be
paid. As a consequence, the Nigerian market place is significantly underinsured, both in absolute
terms and compared to its peers--developing countries with similar GDP per capita. In order to
strengthen the industry, major steps have been taken by the Ministry of Finance that include an
increase in capital requirements for insurance companies to a minimum of US$ 16 million in
2007. The impact of this regulation was to halve the number of insurers to 49. However,
significant work still needs to be carried out in order for the Nigerian Government to meet its
objective of transforming the industry into a key international player.

81.     The legislative framework governing the industry is not in line with international
standards, with items which would ordinarily be covered by regulations having been "hard
coded" into the Nigerian Insurance Act 2003. As a consequence, many minor changes cannot be
made to the insurance legislation without the approval of Parliament. The Insurance Act 2003
does not address key issues such as risk management and anti money laundering, has vague
guidelines on technical reserves calculations and, contrary to international standards, does not
include risk based elements in the computation of insurance company solvency. The Decree
which deals with the establishment and functions of National Insurance Commission
(NAICOMFthe Insurance Regulator-is             outdated as it stems from 1997, whereas IAIS
principles were published in 2003.

82.     NAICOM carries out offsite monitoring and on-site inspections in a routine fashion. Until
February 2008, NAICOM did not practice risk based supervision, nor did it appear to fully
appreciate the technical issues of policy holder reserving and solvency. However, over the past
year, efforts are underway to move from the traditional compliancebased approachtowards risk-
based supervision. Further NAICOM requires significant capacity building in the areas of law
enforcement, IT upgrading and staff training to enable it to perform its expanded role in
regulating the insurance industry in an effective manner.

83.     Reform strategy to reach the outcome goal: Major initiatives by the Government, the
Central Bank of Nigeria, the Insurance Regulator and broad membership of the Nigerian
Insurance Industry aimed at developing the industry are underway including:

           Restructuring of NAICOM: The Insurance Regulator has been radically restructured.
           More than 50 percent of the work force has been retrenched and the organization is
           now searchingfor professional recruits to expand its capacity.

           Adoption of improved insurance supervision plan: NAICOM is gradually moving
           from compliance to risk-based supervision. A review of off-site monitoring and on-
           site inspections took place in November 2008. Reconmendations on suggested

           improvements to existing practices were also put to NAICOM, and new manuals
           were produced with assistance from the Bank. This process is also driving the need to
           upgrade NAICOM's IT systems for which project documents are already at an
           advanced stage of preparation. Furthermore, a compulsory insurance awareness
           campaign was launched in 2008 and NAICOM is approaching stakeholdersto replace
           fake insurance with genuine products, especially in motor and marine insurance. In
           addition, during 2008 there has been strong recognition on the part of all stakeholders
           that a "framework law/regulations/guidancenotes" approach in line with international
           standards would need to be adopted, particularly as two countries in the WAMZ
           region, Ghana and The Gambia, have already done so.

           Enforcement of measures to ensure legitimate claim payment: In the past, a major
           criticism of Nigerian insurance companies has been that they do not pay claims fairly.
           This matter has been addressed partially by the consolidation exercise. In addition
           during NovemberIDecember 2008, NAICOM embarked on a revised process of on-
           site inspections designed,to include new procedures to ascertain the claim payments
           approach of insurance companies. The recent temporary take-over of NICON, which
           forced it to honor claims, also served to set an important precedent in the industry.

                11. Strengthening Pensions Systems toprovide old-age income security and
                  channelfinance for development

84.     Suggested output goal: (i) Risk-adjusted returns of PFAs rise and the diversification of
PFAs' portfolios increases geographically and by asset class; (ii) Assets under management by
PFAs grows; (iii) PFAs better match their portfolios to match the risk aversion and investment
preferences of account holders with the variety of portfolios available to participants increasing.

85.     Issues: The organizational and regulatory approach adopted by the private pension
industry in Nigeria-the   primary service providers (PFA and pension fund custodians) and their
regulator (PENCOMCas established following major reforms initiated in 2004 lives up to
international best practice. Remaining concerns relate to how the industry can be legally and
institutionally protected to ensure that it maintains its observance of international standards and
how the legal and regulatory framework governing the industry can be further strengthened to
ensure fiscal sustainability and welfare adequacy of the pension system and its role in channeling
long term funds to productive means.

86.     The PFA market, as in other countries with mandatory defined contribution schemes, is
highly concentrated. The hture growth of membership depends, first, on the capacity of
Government agencies (tax authority, Ministry of Labor, and others) to enforce the registration of
labor contracts, wage reporting, and collection of contributions, wd second, on the adoption by
the states of the provisions of the 2004 Pension Reform Act. Since it is unlikely that reforms in
these areas will be undertaken soon, leading to a rapid growth in membership, the PFA market
looks to be saturated for the time-being and consolidation in the number of PFAs is to be
expected. Mergers, acquisition, and exits would probably happen even sooner were PENCOM to
adopt a regulation reducing the ceiling on asset management fees.

87.     Currently, PFAs are not allowed to manage multiple portfolios, forcing all members to
hold the same portfolio. PENCOM intends to maintain this provision in the future while PenCom
as supervisor and the PFAs as asset managers gain capacity and pension f u d parlicipants
become more financially literate. This approach is also consistent with the level of development
of the securities market. The supply of domestic securities is small and there is little secondary
trading and room for portfolio differentiation as yet.

88.     The Pension Reforn~Act and the relevant PENCOM regulations and guidelines on fees
set the types and level of fees the pension Eund industry can charge. Asset management fees are
limited to 2 percent of assets, custodians can charge fees of up to 0.6 percent of assets, while
PENCOM is entitled to a regulatory fee of 0.4 percent. These fee levels, especially 2 percent for
asset management, are very high compared to mature markets, but are not out of line with fee
levels seen in other, newly emerging pension fund markets. However, eventually it will be
desirable to bring pressure on the efficiency of the industry through a reduction of the 2 percent
asset management fee.

89.     PENCOM was established to formulate and oversee pension policy in Nigeria as well as
to regulate and supervise the private pension industry. It is unusual to appoint a financial sector
regulator to formulate and oversee pension policy. The regulatory function and the policy
formulation function require different skills, expertise, modes of operation, and level of
independence. Whereas policy formulation is at the heart of the Government, prudent regulation
and supervision require a high level of independence from political interference. It is likely that
requiring PENCOM to serve both roles will lead to undesirable compromises, as their objectives
and means can easily be contradictory.

90.     Reform strategy to reach the outcome goal: The reform actions to strengthen the
pension sector that are currently part of Government's initiatives include:

           PENCOM issues regulation on PFAs investment policies, disclosure, asset allocation
           and pricing: The Pension Reform Act and the previous guidelines on investments
           established quantitative limits for portfolio composition as a result of which the room
           for judgmentldiscretion by PFAs was curtailed. PFAs felt obliged to apply the exact
           limits to their portfolios rather than undertake investment decisions according to
           targeted riskheturn profiles. In addition, these investment policies and benchmarks
           were not disclosed in a standardized format (if at all) as a result of which new entrants
           could not select among PFAs according to their specific riskheturn profiles. In early
           2008 PENCOM issued guidelines on PFAs investment policies, disclosure, asset
           allocation and pricing to address these issues.

           PENCOM issues regulations on investment management: PenCom to issue
           investment management rules regarding: (i) separation of the assets of retirees from
           those of active members; (ii) setting out permissible marketing practices-including
           permissible incentives to members and agents; (iii) setting out limits on asset based
           management fees and brokerage fees applicable to pension funds; (iv) limiting direct
           investment in property.

0 PENCOM and other regulators sign MOU to increase cooperation: PFAs operations
  are closely linked with those of other financial service providers such as brokers,
  traders, life insurers, auditors and actuaries. As a result PENCOM's regulatory efforts
  may be rendered partially ineffective by activities being undertaken by these other
  service providers. Thus in this area it is particularly important that the regulators
  (PENCOM, the Securities and Exchange Commission and ,the Nigeria Stock
  Exchange) sign a memorandum of understanding which lays out the scope and
  manner of cooperation, including reporting andjoint activities.

  PENCOM to prepare a timetable to liberalize overseas investment based on
  consultations with market participants. The regulations will need to specify the types
  of securities and intermediaries in and through which the PFAs would be allowed to
  invest and the conditions which the PFAs wishing to invest abroad would need to
  meet. The liberalization of overseas investments should be linked to an agreed set of
  legal, macroeconomic, fiscal, and financial sector indicators, the achievement of
  which would trigger regulatory responses aimed at expanding the investment horizon
  of PFAs.


Overview of Public Financial Management Reforms

1.      The Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR)
report conducted in 2006 proposes actions to promote a sound Public Financial Management
Environment to address the weaknesses in Public Expenditure Management. The report noted
that while advances were made in macroeconomic and debt management, budget formulation,
accounting, and procurement reform less progress was made with respect to capacity building,
including in the Budget Office, and in such areas of financial accountability as reporting,
monitoring, and disclosure.

2.      The Government is addressing these weaknesses through the implementation of wide
ranging reforms including through the Economic Reform and Governance Project covering three
key areas: (i) financial management and information systems; (ii) external audit; and (iii)
financial reporting. The long term reform agenda is further articulated the National Strategy for
Public Service Reforms: "Towards a World-Class Public Service" which aims to rebuild the
public service with emphasis on critical institutional changes, installing management systems,
and restoring professionalism, merit, competence, and client focus in the medium-term (by
2011). The PFM pillar of this strategy has four key target results: (i) sustained macro-economic
and fiscal stability; (ii) strategic allocation and results-based budgeting of funds; (iii) efficient
management of resources, accounting and reporting; and (iv) integrity in the use of public funds.

3.      The Bank is in discussions with the Ministry of Finance to assist them to conduct a Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) self-assessment with the objective of (i)
assessing the status of the Federal PFM system, processes and institutions to establish baselines
to monitor implementation of the PFM pillar of the National Public Sector Reform Strategy
(NSPSR); and (ii) to track progress in PFM since the PEMFAR assessment.

4.      Suggested output goal: sustained macro-economic and fiscal stability

5.      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework to monitor progress in implementation of
the budget and to assess whether the expected outputs are being produced and the results realized
are not yet in place.

6.      Chart of Accounts: The current chart account is limited as it does not allow classification
of the budget to align ministries activities with policy priorities. Key segments such as
geographical location, program and projects are missing in the classification system. The
classification system used by the Budget Office is not consistent with the Chart of Accounts used
by the Office of the Accountant General making it difficult to directly report actuals against
approved budget.

Reform strategy to reach the outcome goal

7.      Development of sector strategies to implement Government's polices as the basis of
formulationof the budget by costing of activitiesto be implemented by the various MDAs within
an MTSS and MTEF.
8.      Develop a multi-dimensional chart of accounts to provide a framework to align policy
priorities with the budget and financial reports. The budget is expected to translate the policy
intent of the Government into costed activities for implementation by the various MDAs. In
order to be able to analyze and report on the budget, the classification system should be flexible
enough to allow for aggregation of data as well as drill-down to the lowest level. In preparation
for the implementation of GIFMIS an inter-ministerialcommitteesis in place to expand the chart
of accounts to include critical segments such as: fund, organization, program, project, objects
and location. The aim is to ensure consistency between codes used for budget preparation and
accounting and financial reporting. The new chart of account will be comply with the IMF-GFS
2001 manual and provide a framework for preparation of annual financial statements according
to the International Public Sector Accounting Standards.

9.      The Government intends to introduce program budgeting and as a first step will improve
the classification of the budget by functions of Government according to strategic priorities.
Program budgeting and enabling chart of accounts (as a first step to Performance-Based
Budgeting) should be operationalwithin a stable MTEF and annual budget cycle.

10.     Suggested output goal: efficient management of resources, accounting and reporting.

Issues

11.     Financial Reporting: Nigeria does not have a national public sector accounting standard
but in 2002 the Federal and State Governments agreed to adopt a common reporting format for
the preparation of final accounts. Timely and quality financial reports that are publicly available
provide an opportunity to hold public officers accountable for the use of public funds. The
financial reports should also meet minimum standards to be useful for making decisions on the
strategic allocation of resources for service delivery. Although the financial statements have
become timely, they do not adequatelyreflect all sources of funds. ATRRS has been deployed to
all MDAs and has been used to submit transcripts to the Treasury for consolidation. However,
budget figures are not. captured to produce budget performance reports. Management and
reporting structure are still guided by the Finance (Control and Management) Act 1958.

12.     Cash Management: The current practice of transferring cash to various MDA accounts
held in commercial banks leads to a situation of idle cash balances since Government is not in a
position to accurately ascertain its cash position when issuing budget releases and may resort to
unnecessary borrowing. Capital budget performance25for 2008 was 43.9 percent with instances
of huge amounts returned to the Central Bank at the end of the financial year. This can be
attributedto late passage of the budget and lack of timely information on the availability of cash
to plan for budget execution.The Fiscal ResponsibilityLaw requires that the AccountantGeneral
shouldprepare an annual cash plan one month before the start of the year and that the Minister of


25 A background paper prepared for the Budget Office of the Federation: "Budget Implementation, Monitoring and
Evaluation". Prof. Mike I. Obadan (March, 2009)

Finance should publish a disbursement schedule within thirty days of enactment of the
Appropriation Act but this is not currently done. The challenge is to build skills at the MDA
level to prepare annual work plans from which procurement plans can be derived and tied to
disbursement schedules and cash release.

Reform strategy to reachthe outcome goal

13.     The Bill for the amendment of the Finance (Control and Management)Act, Cap 144LFN
1990 is with the Attorney General for review and submission to the National Assembly. The
objective of this Act is to secure transparency, accountability and sound management of the
revenue, assets and liabilities of Government and other public institutions. The Act aims to (a)
regulate financial management; (b) ensure that all revenue, expenditure, assets and liabilities are
managed efficiently and effectively and in a transparent manner; (c) ensure that officers are put
in a position to be able to manage and control all available resources and be more accountable;
(d) ensure the timely provision of quality information; (e) eliminate waste (including fruitless
expenditure) and corruption in the use of public resources; (f) stipulate the responsibilities of
persons entrusted with financial management; and (g) provide for other matters relating to
financialmanagement.

14.     The Government has implemented the interim Accounting Transaction Recording and
Reporting System (ATRRS). Although ATTRS has been deployed to all MDAs, the system is
not linked up with the Treasury and manual vote books are still maintained. Transcripts are
submitted using backup devices. A robust and well secured information management system is
required to protect the credibility of financial reports for decision making. The conceptualization
of the Government Integrated Financial Management Information System (GIFMIS) has been
completed through a consultative process under the direction of steering committee chaired by
the Accountant General and reporting to the Minister of Finance. A phased implementation
approach has been adopted starting with the core foundationmodules (General Ledger including
bank reconciliation, Appropriation, Expenditure Payment and Reporting). The system is
expected to become operational in 2010 at the Budget Office and the Accountant General's
Office and will later be roll-out to MDAs and FPOs with additional modules (Purchasing,
Revenue, Assets and Inventory); interfaces will be provided to existing debt management
systems and revenue administration systems. The implementation of GIFMIS will transform the
way Government operates financial management. The quality and timeliness of financial reports
will also be improved.

15.     The Government has adopted a cash management policy. Timely availability of cash is
critical for successful implementation of the budget. Fiscal discipline requires keeping
expenditure within the Government cash constraints. Reliable forecasting tools should be used
whereby revenue projections and cash plans will inform preparation and publication of
Disbursement Schedules as stipulated in the Fiscal Responsibility Act. To achieve this, the
Office of the Accountant General should be in a position to undertake timely and efficient bank
reconciliationto determine its overall cash position at any point in time. Fragmentation of bank
accounts in commercial banks and limitations in connectivity infrastructure at the MDAs poses a
serious challenge to consolidate Government's cash position. The recently developed Cash
Management Policy notes that "A Treasury Single Account (TSA) shall be maintained at Central
Bank of Nigeria with each MDA responsible for the management of its allocations but effecting
payment through the TSA ...up to their cash allocationceiling".

16.     Availability of funds for commitment of expenditures is becoming more predictable
through cash-backing of budget releases. Meanwhile, the Government has adopted electronic

payment through the use of mandates until such time when connectivity challengesand use of an
integrated inter-switch system is established. With GIFMIS the TSA will be more efficient and
further solidifythe E-Payment system.

17.     Improved financial reporting by adopting the cash model of the International Public
Sector Accounting Standard (IPSAS). Personnel from The Government Accounting Standards
Advisory Board (GASAB) in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India
Government will work closely with counterparts from Office of the Accountant General of the
Federation, Nigerian Accounting Standards Board and Office of the Auditor General for the
Federation to conduct an .The specific objective of the assessment is to develop a report for the
country authorities which: (a) provides the Government and other interested stakeholders with a
common well-based knowledge as to where the country stands against the internationally
developed norms of public sector financial reporting; (b) assesses the consequences of the
prevailing variances; (c) provides a basis for measuring interim compliance; and (d) charts paths
for improved compliance with IPSAS casli basis.

18.     Suggested output goal: integrity in the use of public funds.

Issues:

19.     The internal audit function for now mainly focuses on pre-payment audit and post audit
of transactions. The Internal Audit Units are not staffed with adequately qualified professionals
and there is no clear professional career path. Independence is not assured due to insufficient
funding and there is over-reliance on financial support from the Auditees (MDAs). Audit
Committees are not in place to follow-up on implementation of internal audit findings and
recommendations.

20.     Whilst the Auditor General has made efforts to clear the backlog of audit reports up to
2006, more efforts are needed to improve on the quality of audit practices by adoption of
International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Currently a volume one report is issued containing
findings on transactions audits and a volume two is later issued to provide an audit opinion on
receipt of the financial statements.The audit report needs to be comprehensiveto cover all public
funds and highlight systemic control issuesthat pose a fiduciary risk to public funds. The Federal
Government still uses a 1956 Audit Law Which needs to be update to strengthen the
independence of the Auditor General and broaden the scope of work and adopt modem audit
techniques.

Reform strategy to reach the outcomegoal

21.     Internal audit should play an important monitoring role in evaluating the effectivenessof
the control systems within the Government's operations in meeting its strategic objectives. In
this regard a shift from pre-payment audit is required with a new focus of ensuring: (i) MDAs
conform to the Government's strategy (NEEDSIseven-point agenda); (ii) effectiveness and
efficiency of operations; (iii) reliability of financial reporting; and (iv) compliance with
applicable laws and regulations. The Auditor General can place reliance on the work of the
Internal Audit hction if found to be independent and operating according to acceptable
standards. Establishment of Audit Committees to approve and monitor internal audit work

programs and follow up on internal audit findings and recommendations will enhance the quality
of the Internal Audit function across Government.

22.      Public assets register system will be installed in all MDAs to ensure that assets are
properly accounted for and utilized for the purposes intended.

23.      Strengthen oversight institutions such as the Office of the Auditor General, the Public
Accounts Committee and the Fiscal Responsibility Council. Access to budget information and
financial reports provides an opportunity for open public participation in the budget process. The
work of the Legislature and the Auditor General to hold the Government accountable is further
strengthened through publication of financial information. For the Auditor General's Office to
perform its mandate objectively, the Office needs to be independent of the Executive. In this
regard, the long outstanding Audit Bill needs to be passed to provide for the operational and
financial independence of the Auditor General's Office. There is need for qualified staff and
facilities for discharging its constitutional responsibilities and piloting of value for money (VFM)
audits.

24.      The capacity of the Public Accounts Committee especially the secretariat that is expected
to provide technical advisory services needs to be built. Furthermore, a functional Fiscal
Responsibility Commission will ensure strict compliance with transparency and accountability
provisions

Summary recommendations for improving capital budget implementation

25.      With a view to analyzing constraints to the more effective execution of the capital
budget, the Budget Office of the Federation commissioned in March 2009 a study which resulted
in a number of recommendation^.^^              Some of the recommendations have already been
implemented, while others are still being considered by the Governrnent.


26.      Restoring confidence in the Budget Formulation Process and Commitment to
Implementation. For MDAs to be able to properly budget for that component of a multi-year
project that can be implemented in a fiscal year, they need to be assured that projects that are
admitted into the budget will be funded annually to completion. Also, it should be possible for
projects whose contracts are not awarded by the third quarter to be rolled over and funded in the
budget of the subsequent year. This means that projects that are not likely to be completed by
year end should be identified early for roll-over to the next budget. Reassuring MDA's on this
will prevent rushed and wasteful spending by MDAs at year-end to exhaust budget releases. An
essential prerequisite for the more effective execution of the capital budget and avoiding
overloading of the budget are realistic cost estimates for projects.

27.      Early preparation and submission of the Appropriation Bill and early enactment of the
Bill into an Act. This is fundamental and the present practice requires significant improvement.
For this to happen there is need for a clear timetable for budget formulation and enactment. The
budget process for the next fiscal year has to start early in AprilMay of the current fiscal year so


26This study was prepared as background paper for the workshop on capital budget implementation held on March
24,2009 in Abuja

                                                      104

that the Appropriation Bill can be submitted to NASS by the first day of September. By the end
of the year, it should be enacted and ready for implementation from January of the new fiscal
year.

28.     Early Release and Cash-backing of Warrants. In light of the above recommendation and
against the backdrop of the experience of 2008, it is highly desirable to have a systematic, as
opposed to rushed and inefficient, implementation of the capital budget. To this end, the
quarterly release of funds should be done in the first month of each quarter.

29.     Effective coordination with the National Assembly. Extensive consultations with the
National Assembly prior to the submission of the annual budget is essential to avoid substantial
revisions to the budget that may not be fully coordinated with MDAs and stretch their
implementation capacity and introduce uncertainty on budget outcomes.

30.     Adhere to the MTEFIMTSS Framework to ensure budget discipline: To this end, the
following measures are important.

           The annual capital budget should be based on the prioritization articulated in the
           MTEFIMTSS. Avoid introducing new projects that are inconsistent with priorities
           outlined in the MTSS.

           NASS should be involved in the MTSS prioritization. Other stakeholders should also
           be involved to make the process highly participatory and bottom-up.

31.     Capacity Building for compliance with the Public Procurement Act. The Procurement
Act entails procedures which help to ensure that budgets and spending are not only based on
authentic, reasonable and fair costing, but are also appropriately geared to the realization of set
targets and priorities reflected in the budget. What is required is for MDAs to build appropriate
capacity to fully implement the Act, build adequate capacity for compliance with the procedures
and commence early compliance with aspects of the processes even before the enactment of the
budget.

32.     Capacity for Project Implementation: To achieve this objective, it is important to consider
the central deployment of technical/professional staff by the Ministry of Works to ministries that
do not have the in-house capacity to prepare project documents. Furthermore, there is the need
for systematic training and re-training of budget officers, procurement officers, monitoring and
evaluations officers, etc, on budget implementation processes and best practices.

33.     Monitoring and Evaluation of Projects: MDAs need to strengthen the monitoring and
reporting on projects. This requires the setting up monitoring and evaluation units and adequately
empowering them with funds, human capacity and logistics. Adequate funding of M&E could be
achieved by earmarking a share of the capital budget of the MDA (0.5 - 1%) for monitoring and
evaluation. Regarding the timely production of progress reports on budget implementation, the
plans of the Budget Office to send monitoring templates to MDAs as basis to provide quarterly
reports on capital budget implementation is an important undertaking. Finally, one way to ensure
that MDAs comply with the reporting requirement is to tie release of funds for
projects1procurement to reports on earlier funds released or projects executed.
