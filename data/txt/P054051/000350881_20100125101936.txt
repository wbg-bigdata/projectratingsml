1.     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1     Context at Appraisal
The Solid Waste and Environmental Management Project (SWEMP) were presented to the
Board on October 10, 2000 and became effective in December of that year. Board presentation
coincided almost exactly with the beginning of the 2nd Palestinian Intifada.i The implications of
this event were not fully appreciated by donors or the general public at the time, but by
November 2000 Israeli-Palestinian military hostilities were in progress. These and subsequent
events left some 1,500 Palestinians and 400 Israelis dead and had a major negative effect on the
Palestinian economy, social fabric and institutions. They also seriously impacted the prospects
for peace that emerged after the September 1993 Declaration of Principles (better known as the
Oslo Agreement) between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). Further,
they had an extremely negative impact on the implementation of SWEMP--the project location,
Jenin, was a major battlefield--and on the entire Bank portfolio in West Bank and Gaza (WBG).ii

It is perhaps worth noting that 1999 and the first part of 2000, the period during which SWEMP
was being prepared, was a very optimistic one. The Clinton administration was urgently trying to
forge a more lasting peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians. In addition, there
was talk of building a major industrial estate on the Jenin-Israel border. These latter efforts
helped place the environment and Jenin on the policy agenda. SWEMP was also prepared in the
context of a broader process of policy evolution in WBG. Beginning soon after the signing of
Oslo in 1993 and leading the donor effort, the Bank focused on emergency rehabilitation (mainly
infrastructure, health and education). After significant successes, in 1997 the Bank began to
promote a more ambitious longer term strategy aimed at addressing institutional and governance
issues and promoting sector-specific restructuring and reform.iii SWEMP was one of the
cornerstones of this strategy.
1.2      Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The "overall" PDO as stated in the PAD was: "to implement an environmentally sound solid
waste management system for Jenin District". The PDO indicators were: i) beneficiary
satisfaction with services provided; ii) financial sustainability of project through gradual increase
in tariff and revenue collection to meet collection and disposal costs; iii) passage of the
Environmental Law; and iv) over 200,000 population served. As noted in the PAD, the
objectives supported the Bank's broader policy thrusts outlined above. The indicators focused
on widespread benefits to the local population; cost recovery and the building of capacity at
national and local levels. They also focused on preserving two key national assets: scarce
groundwater resources and the considerable natural and cultural heritage of the West Bank.
1.3   Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
The PDO remained unchanged during the life of the project.
1.4     Main Beneficiaries
The target beneficiaries at appraisal were the 200,000 people living in the Jenin District in 2000.
This target was never revised. It was expected at appraisal that the target population would
benefit from improved SWM services; better public health due the closure of unsightly and
unhygienic; better preservation of water quality in underground aquifers. In addition, it was
expected that tourism--especially from across the northern border with Israel--would benefit

                                                                                                    1
from the cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing environment envisaged. Further, municipalities
and the MEnA were expected to benefit "through enhanced institutional capacity building".iv




                                                                                              2
1.5    Original Components
The project comprised 3 basic components and was estimated to cost a total of US$14.0m. The
components were as follows:
1.     Design and Construction of Controlled landfill at Zahrat Al-Finjan,v Jenin District
       including the following: construction of Landfill; closure of uncontrolled dumpsites; and
       recurrent costs during operation of the landfill (US$9.5m; 68 percent of project costs).
2.     Primary Collection, Haulage and Disposal of Solid Wastes by Municipalities and
       Villages of Jenin District: equipment for SWM and incremental operation and
       maintenance costs of the equipment (US$3.25m; 23 percent of project costs).
3.     Capacity Building in the Jenin Joint Service Council (JSC) and the Participating
       Municipalities: assistance in public awareness campaigns; monitoring and enforcement;
       strengthening the implementing capacity of JSC and municipalities in SWM; and piloting
       recycling projects (US$1.25m; 9 percent of project costs).
Components 1 and 3 were financed by the Bank, and component 2 by the European Union (EU).
The Bank share of total project cost was US$9.5m or 68 percent; the EU's share was US$ 3.25m
equivalent or 23 percent; and the Palestinian Authority's share was US$1.25m or 9 percent of the
total. The composition of the PA's share was not stated in the PAD, however it is believed to
have included customs, taxes foregone, and acquisition costs for the landfill site. The JSC was
responsible for implementing components 1 and 2, while the JSC and the MEnAvi shared
responsibility for implementing component 3.
1.6     Revised Components
The components were not changed. However, at the request of the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
the Legal Agreement was amended on December 18, 2002 to make provision for "Part Z:
Damage repair and Emergency Service Support Activities". This comprised: Carrying out of a
program through (i) JSC and (ii) EQA, consisting of the provision of goods and the execution of
works, with a view to rehabilitating damaged physical and institutional infrastructure, and
mitigating the decline in essential public service provision, including, electricity, water,
wastewater, solid waste and social services.
An amount of US$0.5m was provided from an internal reallocation of funds.vii The original and
actual components and costs are summarized in Table 1. Here it will be seen that the final project
cost is US$14.42m equivalent,viii and the Bank share about US$9.42m. A more detailed
breakdown is provided in Annex 1.

1.7      Other significant changes
There were several other changes during implementation, but none involved changes to the PDO
or were significant enough to require a restructuring. The main changes included: i) redesign and
operation of the landfill to reduce the footprint, reduce costs, increase efficiency, and preserve
important site features including existing olive trees, and an existing road; ii) separation of the
landfill design from construction instead of the original design/build plan; iii) widening of the
geographic scope of the project by the Jenin JSC to accept waste delivery from several other
municipalities in the Nablus and Tulkarem governorates and iv) linkage of SW tariffs to prepaid
electricity bills in Jenin between January and June 2008 resulting in more efficient collections.ix
It is also worth noting here that at the request of the government the project was extended several
times. It was supposed to closed in December 2005 but did not closed until June 2009.x

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Quality was not formally reviewed through the QAE process. However, the following is a brief
retrospective assessment: i) Consistency with Assistance Strategy: The PDO at appraisal was
wholly consistent with and supportive of the overall Assistance Strategy for WBG. Particularly,
SWEMP was designed to directly support 3 of the 4 broad Assistance themes: a) opportunities
for private sector involvement through public-private partnerships; b) public sector management
and institution building; and c) human resource development and poverty alleviation. The project
was also consistent with the Bank's Middle East and North Africa Region's three-pronged
environmental strategy which included strengthening of institutions, arresting emerging
pollution, and protecting scarce natural resources.
ii) Soundness of Background Analysis: SWEMP built on the experience of several other Bank
projects; on the successful experience of a similar project in middle Gaza funded by GTZ
including the establishment of SWM JSC; on a feasibility study funded by a PHRD grant; and on
technical and administrative support from the Bank-administered TATF. It also drew upon
studies undertaken by the PA itself. Thus it was well grounded in analyses.
iii) Participation and Dialogue during Preparation: During preparation, discussion with
Ministry of Local Government (MOLG), EQA, the Jenin local government units (LGUs) and
community groups, and Israeli environmental and military authorities seem to have been
extensive. There was also considerable dialogue with donors who were then active in the sector,
particularly the European Union (EU), the governments of Germany, Japan and Italy.
iv) Project Design: Project design was appropriate, eschewing complexity, and focusing on one
relatively small geographic area (Jenin) and one core task (sanitary landfill construction). Also,
the requirements for the establishment of a Contingency Fund to support landfill operations and
the proposed increases in tariff during implementation were necessary and reasonable in the
circumstance. However, scheduling of implementation left something to be desired. While the
PAD makes reference to an Implementation Plan prepared by the Client, there was no clearly
defined timeline for the implementation of the key components. Also, the PAD makes reference
to the readiness of the tender document for the design/build landfill contract in September 2000

                                                                                                        4
(i.e., roughly at Board), but this seems to have been overly optimistic. Further, monitoring
indicators were not specified in sufficient detail, leading to eventual attempts by the Bank
supervision team to attempt to re-specify the indicators.
v) Project Risk Evaluation: The risks were well defined. One of the eight risks identified were
rated high; four were rated substantial; and three were rated modest. The overall project risk was
rated substantial. The risk assessment and mitigation measures were probably realistic and
appropriate at the time. However the major risk that dramatically and negatively affected
implementation--the onset of the second Palestinian Intifada in September 2000, less than 2
weeks after the project was submitted to the Board and before effectiveness--was not anticipated.
Given that few if any donors in WBG anticipated this near cataclysmic event; it would be
unreasonable to have expected the project preparation team to have done so. This major event
and the subsequent Israeli military response had a tremendously negative impact on almost all
aspects of Palestinian life and on the Jenin community particularly.
2.2     Implementation
Four factors may be cited as decisive in project implementation, one negative and four positive.
The first and only negative factor was the delay in the preparation and execution of the core
landfill component, caused largely by Israeli military response to the Intifada beginning just after
effectiveness, peaking in 2002 when Jenin was effectively blockaded, project offices were shot
at, waste containers and roads were damaged, and PIU staff, consultants and Bank supervision
operated with difficulty. Even after the hostilities peaked, Israeli checkpoints and restrictions on
movement of people and goods--including construction material supplies--slowed progress
(according to ISRs the project was at risk up to early 2005 because of the hostilities). Despite
these problems, considerable progress was made by the PIU during the period in cleaning up the
urban areas and closing the uncontrolled dumpsites, building public awareness, and preparing the
landfill design. In fact, the PIU did perhaps about as much as they reasonably could under the
circumstances. This effort was recognized by the January 2004 mid-term review which was
highly complementary about the "exemplary" work undertaken and progress made under very
difficult conditions. This review recommended only minor changes to the landfill design and
monitoring arrangements. It did note that the planned intake of the waste (180-200 tons/day) was
much less than desirable for economic reasons, but considered it acceptable in the situation.xi
The second factor was the extremely bold decision by the JSC to employ the services of an
Israeli SWM expert in helping to redesign the landfill under a supervision contractxii--a risky
decision at the best of times, but extraordinary given the on-going political and military conflict
and major suffering among the population in Jenin. This decision not only resulted in more
efficient design and considerable cost saving, but may have helped reassure Israeli authorities
that adequate environmental standards were being adhered to, and it may have helped disarm the
Military authorities--possibly reducing the political risk and thus facilitating implementation
though this cannot be verified.
The third and perhaps most decisive factor was the decision of the Nablus municipality to
participate.xiii This plus the later participation of Tulkarem municipality i) more than doubled the
delivery of waste to the landfill; ii) vastly improved the technical efficiency of the landfill; iii)
completely changed the economics of the project; xiv iv) almost tripled the number of potential
beneficiaries; and v) reduced the pressure on the JSC for further tariff increases within the Jenin
Governorate to improve cost recovery--particularly at a time of widespread local financial
distress.xv Unexpectedly, the Jenin landfill in effect became the Northern West Bank Region
landfill--a major and highly positive change.

                                                                                                   5
The fourth factor was the strong on-ground Bank supervision team -- the support of which
cannot be too highly stressed. This was a critical role, well played. (See discussion in Sec. 5.1)xvi
2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E Design: The output indicators were appropriate though, as noted, not adequately specified
(see Sec. 2.1).
M&E Implementation: Because of the M&E design deficiencies, progress monitoring had to rely
almost solely on general statements and initiatives of the PIU--a situation that was recognized by
the Bank supervision team--certainly by April 2005 (ISR # 10). Also, the 2005 supervision team
noted that the quality of the available data left something to be desired.
M&E Utilization: Two important uses should be noted. The PIU kept good records and closely
monitored progress on the closure/rehabilitation of the unsanitary dumpsites. Also, they
undertook several social surveys (with the help of the Arab American University in Jenin) and
informal consultations with municipalities and village councils to assess beneficiary satisfaction
with services and willingness to pay. In addition they utilized the data collected to inform JSC
decisions on tariff changes, collection methods, site dumping charges, etc. Further, they used the
data to help the participating LGUs to inform their own decisions--in effect, providing technical
assistance to them. However, it is not clear how systematic the surveys were.xvii The issue here
apparently was not the unwillingness of the PIU to monitor and evaluate systematically. It was
more one of their not having an appropriate monitoring framework and effective instruments.xviii
2.4      Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
a)       Environmental Safeguard Compliance: The project triggered OP 4.01. The
Environmental Assessment including project specific Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
was prepared and disclosed locally and in the InfoShop. The project also comprised EMP
mitigation measures. For example, the landfill to be constructed and operational in accordance
with international standards including: i) two layers of polyethylene liner were installed to
protect the groundwater with leachatte deposited into a specially designed pool; ii) the landfill is
fully fenced and a guarded gate is in place prohibiting access to unauthorized persons or wild
animals; iii) deposited waste is compacted and covered reducing the foul odors; iv) very limited
impact on environment since cover material from the landfill excavation process stored on site;
v) waste collection efficiency has been improved especially with the construction of sub-regional
transfer stations and the utilization of trailer trucks reducing with that traffic generated by the
many municipal owned waste collection trucks. Unfortunately, environmental monitoring by
EQA over the landfill operations has not been undertaken as planned. EQA staff undertook only
a limited official review of the landfill operations with very little reporting on compliance
recorded. However, EQA has recently agreed with the Jenin JSC on an action plan that would
ensure routine review, and compliance monitoring of key environmental indicators. The results
of this agreement remain to be seen.
b)       Social Safeguard Compliance: OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement was not triggered
in spite of the identification of two issues related to loss of income to waste-pickers and land
acquisition. In fact there were about 50 waste-pickers whom were affected by the project. Ten of
these were full-time waste pickers, and they were all offered job in the formal SWM sector. Only
eight of the ten took advantage of this opportunity while the remaining two indicated that they
were not interested. The remaining pickers were waste collection workers whose income has
improved with their transfer to the JSC. With regard to land acquisition, the post project
Beneficiary Assessment indicated that the original landowners were evidently satisfied with the
compensation paid to them. Although potential safeguard issues, particularly those related to loss

                                                                                                    6
of livelihood, seem to have been handled well given the circumstances. If the standards being
observed in 2009 were to have been applied, OP 4.12 would have been triggered. In retrospect,
OP 4.12 was triggered during the August 2009 amendment of the associated Italian TFGA.
c)       Fiduciary Compliance: Procurement and Financial Management
Procurement was generally well managed by the PIU and EQA, and the Bank's procurement
Guidelines were respected. Thus there were no significant procurement problems. Bank
procurement supervision was also satisfactory and responded well to issues as they arose.
Financial management was also satisfactory. Adequate accounting systems and controls were
established at the PIU, and the staff was generally competent and well trained. The required
quarterly and annual reports were produced--mostly on time--and timely and informative audit
reports were prepared and submitted to the Bank for review. (See Annex 2.3 for a summary of
the procurement and financial reporting, and safeguard compliance generally.)
2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
The JSC and the PIU have been making plans for the post-completion operation phase, and have
already taken a number of significant steps. They have competent managerial and operating staff
in place and managing effectively; they have prepared an operating plan for the next few years
(though this has yet to be made available to the Bank for review); and just as important they have
signed a contract with a private investor to establish a waste recycling plant--a highly significant
development. Of course there are risks, and these are discussed in Sec. 4 below.




                                                                                                  7
3.     Assessment of Outcomes
3.1      Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
SWEMP spoke frontally to the Bank's policy objectives at appraisal. Priorities have changed
since the Intifada. By 2005 the Bank began to reconnect with its earlier efforts at reform and
institution building. In the current context, the now widely acknowledged successful design and
implementation of SWEMP provides a useful model. The project's achievements have, and
continue to support the Bank's strategy and assistance program in the WBG. The latest program
(FY08-10) aims to support the PA's Reform and Development Plan (PRDP), with the
overarching objective of accelerating Palestinian economic recovery. PRDP is anchored on four
pillars, and SWEMP supports two of the four as follows: Pillar No.1: improve governance and
support fiscal reform; and Pillar No. 4: public infrastructure development. Further the follow-on
SWMP is among the Bank's key instruments to support the PRDP. It provides additional
financial and technical resources for an operation based on and quite similar to SWEMP, and
aims to serve the large population in the southern West Bank.
3.2      Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Overall Achievement of PDO: To implement an Environmentally Sound Solid Waste
Management System for Jenin District. Rating: HS. (See discussion below.)
Beneficiary Satisfaction: Survey findings present a rather mixed picture. The data indicate that
the institutional beneficiaries (the LGUs) are quite satisfied, and several outside the system are
desirous of joining in. A few LGUs however seem to have mixed feelings about the cost and
whether or not their areas are cleaner than before. With households the picture is more
mixed.Those who were aware of the new landfill operation seemed to be quite positive, though
several seemed unaware dispite the public education efforts of the JSC. Most also seemed
reasonably tolerant with the tariff. (See additional coments in Achievement by Component below,
Sec. 3.6, and Annex 2.2.) Rating: MS
Financial Sustainability: As indicated in Sec. 3.3 below and Annex 3, the landfill operation (the
key project component) is financially sustainable. Not only is it able to pay back the Bank Credit
as required under the subsidiary agreement between the JSC and MOF, it is also generating
sufficient surpluses to maintain and improve service levels, replace equipment, and expand the
landfill once the capacity at current cells is exhausted. Sustainability should also be further
enhanced by the proposed private sector-led recycling operation. Of course there are risks, see
Section 4 below. But few if any Bank/donor projects in WBG show such positive prospects.
Rating: HS
Passage of the Environmental Law: The law was passed in December 2000, quickly satisfying
this criterion. Rating: S
Number of People Served: Almost the entire urban population of Jenin and Tubas Governorates
is now served--the 200,000 targeted. Even more significant as noted above, the landfill now
accepts waste from Nablus, Tulkarem and Anabta municipalities. This was an initiative of the
Jenin JSC which almost tripled (600,000) the population served. Rating: HS
Achievement by Component: The assessment here focuses on objectives. A summary of output
by component is presented in Annex 2.2.
Safe disposal of solid waste in controlled landfills: There were two output indicators:



                                                                                                 8
Proof of Purchase/Lease of land: A condition of Effectiveness met in 2000 without delay.
Rating: S
Construction of controlled landfill: This was achieved in mid 2007--albeit some 4 years late. By
all accounts the design, construction and operation of the landfill has been very good (some
would say exemplary), attracting visitors ranging from school children to visiting Bank and
donor dignitaries and the Palestinian Prime Minister--culture changing eventsxix. In addition, the
random and uncontrolled dumpsites in Jenin and Tubas governorates were closed. Rating: S
Environmentally Sound Collection and Transfer of Solid Wastes to Landfills in Jenin District:
There were two indicators as follows:
Mitigation measures from the EIA implemented: These have all or significantly been
accomplished. Rating: S
Number of uncontrolled dumpsites rehabilitated and closed: The PAD referred to some 100
uncontrolled dump sites would be closed. However, this was based on the preliminary analysis
undertaken in the feasibility study conducted by ERM prior to project preparation. More careful
analysis conducted by the JSC indicated that the actual number was 85,xx and these have all been
closed and rehabilitated. Closure took place in two stages. In the first stage some of the worst
sites were closed and rehabilitated--and some were considerably re-engineered to a much higher
technical standard and used as temporary sites pending the completion of the new landfill.
Finally all of the sites were closed once the new Landfill was completed in mid-2007. Rating:
HS
It is worth noting here that the EU supported the Landfill waste management and collection
equipment component; and the Italians later supported a related SWM component in the Anabta
(Tulkarem District) to the south west of Jenin.
Stakeholder Ownership of Project: There were two indicators as follows:
Beneficiary satisfaction with services provided: As indicated in the beneficiary satisfaction
section above, the findings here are mixed. (Also see BA Section below and at Annex 5.) Rating:
MS.
A well functioning JSC. By any realistic criteria, the Jenin JSC performed well above
expectations. They led strongly, promoted and defended their project, and took difficult as well
as creative decisions to achieve the PDO. (See discussion on implementing agency performance
in Sec. 5.2 (b)). Rating: HS
Enhanced Implementation Capacity within the Municipalities to Efficiently Manage the Project:
There was a single indicator here: Establishment of a management structure to implement the
project - such as solid waste management council or a Corporation. What has been said above
with respect to the JSC applies equally well to the PIU. (See also later discussion in Sec. 5.2 (b)).
Rating: HS
Enhanced monitoring and enforcement capacity within the EQA: Again there was a single
indicator here: EQA houses a SWM project monitoring unit with well trained staff. This is the one
significant weak spot in the entire project. Seemingly EQA were simply unable to deliver
effectively on their commitments under the project. The location of EQA's headquarters and
leadership in Gaza may have made it difficult to respond to events and commitment in the West
Bank, much less in Jenin. Rating: MUS
3.3    Efficiency
Focusing specifically on the question of efficiency, the following should be noted:
The number of beneficiaries has been tripled with no increase in initial capital expenditure.
Further, the estimated expenditure per beneficiary over the next 15 years has decreased from

                                                                                                   9
US$160/person using PAD assumptions to US$51.2/person (US$32m/200,000 in 2000 vs.
US$30.7m/600,000 in 2009).
The technical efficiency of the landfill has been greatly enhanced because of the economies of
scale achieved in going from a waste intake of 180-200 to 400-500 tons/day. Although this
shortens the life of the landfill, a potentially positive offsetting factor is the recycling component
that is already being implemented and is due to greatly expanded.
With regard to tariffs, the 2000 PAD indicated an existing weighted average tariff of NIS10/
household/month within a range of NIS 5-17; and it estimated the need for the tariff to be
increased to about NIS18/household/month for effective cost recovery. The published 2008
accounts of the JSC indicate that full cost recovery was covered from users, and that this was
achieved at tariffs ranging from NIS10-18/household/month. Further tariffs can support not just
operating costs, but capital repayments and replacement costs s well.

More broadly, the PAD (Section E) noted the difficulty of fully quantifying the economic
benefits of sanitary landfill projects because of the difficulty of calculating the value of benefits
associated with spillover effects. It also noted that "...analysis based on up-to-date costs
indicates that the project is economically viable based on revenues from service users only."
Further, it indicated that a weighted average tariff of NIS17 /household/month was thought to be
feasible; and on the basis of "...discounted cash flows at a 12 percent cost of capital, an average
payment of NIS17.4 per household would result in a positive benefit cost ratio of 1.18:1". The
recently conducted and relatively broad analysis of the landfill operation (see Annex 3)
concludes that:
On the basis of the original PAD assumptions,xxi the IRR is 12 percent at 80% cost recovery
(base case), increasing to 26 percent at 90 percent recovery, and decreasing to 0 percent at 70
percent recovery. This indicates that the project remains feasible, but is slightly more sensitive to
a decline in the payment rate than originally expected. However, given the changes in the project
the PAD assumptions are no longer realistic.
The current IRR is approximately 43% at 90% cost recovery (current base case), decreasing to
32% at 80% recovery, and to 17% at 70% recovery. In more constrained conditions where both
collection efficiency declines by 10% and operating costs rise by 10%, the IRR is still 22%. It is
only when a 20% decline in collection efficiency is accompanied by a 10% increase in cost that
the IRR drops to 0%. This indicates that the project, while quite robust, is more sensitive to
collection efficiency than cost rises, as predicted in the 2000 PAD cost assumptions, but this
sensitivity is less acute than originally estimated. Further, the estimated rates of return are
significantly greater than the Bank's 10-12% threshold for MENA countries.

The current evaluation also concludes that JSC appears to have developed a realistic tariff
structure for those municipalities (22 at the present time) that pay for waste collection and/or
disposal on a per ton basis. In sum, the ZAF Landfill is deemed to be an efficient and viable
going concern, even if the unquantifiable spillover effects are not factored into the analysis. Not
the least of these unquantifiable are protection of the invaluable groundwater aquifer; a cleaner
environment; improved public health; lands released and increased property values nearby the
closed dumpsite--not to mention the value of the institutional changes engendered. When these
are factored in, the net economic benefits would appear to be very positive indeed.
3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating


                                                                                                    10
Overall rating: HS. Based solely on the raw rating score on each indicator the overall rating
should be S only (see Annex 2.1). However, this ICR takes the view that this rating seriously
underestimates the achievements of this project for the following reasons:
1.       An environmentally sound landfill has been constructed--even to the satisfaction of Israeli
authorities who recently cited the Jenin experience as the reason for their willingness to support the new
SWMP (Bank's November 2, 2009 meeting with these authorities).
2.       The key beneficiary and cost recovery targets were greatly exceeded.
3.       The project: (a) is technically far more efficient than planned by virtue of increased scale
economy; (b) is moving quickly to incorporate significant recycling--far beyond anything originally
envisaged at appraisal; (c) is helping to change the culture, a conclusion that was reinforced by the views
of the participants in the Stakeholder Review meeting held on November 11, 2009;xxii (d) has had a
significant impact on institutional reform and policy development outside of Jenin and outside the SWM
sector;xxiii (e) has helped to change the PA's SWM's strategy for the West Bank, reducing the number of
planned sanitary landfills, significantly improving the overall economies of scale and resource allocation.
4.       The JSC and PIU ownership and commitment and performance has been extraordinary--well
beyond that in any other recent project in WBG--and demonstrated in a very difficult context.
5.       While the BA data may be somewhat ambiguous, its finding of some 50 percent of citizens
interviewed are satisfied with the service is not to be taken lightly. This is deemed to be a good result in
this difficult sector. Further, citizen satisfaction is strongly evidenced by the willingness to pay for the
services--albeit through the linkage to the prepaid electricity bill in Jenin.
Taken as a whole, the above achievements are extraordinary. The one really weak point was
environmental monitoring. This may seem to be highly problematic, and is to some extent.
However, as things stand in WBG the central government is developing and it is the LGUs that
really count and are the ones accountable to citizens for environmental quality and service
delivery. EQA needs to improve but the JSC and the LGUs are performing well--at least on
SWM issues in Jenin. Thus, as a practical matter EQA's weak monitoring performance does not
detract significantly from the major achievements noted above. An interesting question is why
the above factors were not reflected in the ISRs (see Annex 2.3). The answer may be that the
Bank's progress monitoring and reporting system does not normally go beyond examination of
the project specific issues and indicators outlined in the PAD. Thus, it may not fully capture
some key aspects of the larger development picture.
3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
The overarching themes have been environmental protection, sustainable municipal service
delivery, and the building social capital. It should be clear from the above discussion that much
has been accomplished in these areas.
(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development: These areas were not
specifically targeted. However, the poor will benefit from the closure of unsanitary dumpsites
next to their dwellings (often the typical location), and from the health and property value
benefits that should accrue. Some 1,200 dunums were made usable, some for community
recreational purposes, because of the clean up and closure of the dump sites. Also, a significant
number (about 7,000 person days) of lower-level employment and income opportunities were
created under the emergency damage repair sub-component and several could materialize--
particularly if the proposed private sector-led recycling initiative noted above is successful.
These will benefit the poor. In addition, in the process of closing the dumpsites several access
roads to relatively poor villages were improved, making it easier for people and goods to move
in and out. This is sure to have had a positive impact on access to trading opportunities, to
education, and to health and social services for women as well as the poor. Further, women, who

                                                                                                         11
often bear the brunt of family health and problems, are likely to have benefited
disproportionately. However, the above mentioned benefits are difficult to quantify.
(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening
The JSC accomplishment has been significant. Not only did they succeed in its main SWM
mission, it seems to have become a locus for discussions on other municipal matters. This augurs
well for further municipal development and local development in general. Further, it has
demonstrated that fruitful institutional cooperation is possible not just in Jenin, but also across
and between governorates--no small accomplishment. Some examples of change include: i)
MOLG's and EQA's decision to establish only 3 sanitary landfills in the West Bank instead of
the 5 previously planned--with Jenin covering the North; ii) The success of the Jenin JSC has
encouraged the PA, in particular MOLG & EQA, to establish similar JSCs in other governorates;
iii) The recently approved Bank SWMP in southern West Bank will be working with two JSCs
(Hebron and Bethlehem) who have even joined forces to establish an umbrella called the Higher
JSC for both governorates, to manage waste generated in both governorates; and iv) The JSC
concept is being replicated to cover other sectors, for example wastewater management.
(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
Few expected that: i) the JSC and PIU would function as well as they did; ii) the fee collection
problem would be largely solved in Jenin by the previously unplanned attachment to the pre-paid
electricity bill; iii) other governorates would join in, resulting in improved economies of scale for
the landfill as well an altogether more efficient SWM strategy for the Northern West Bank and
WBG as a whole; and iv) the landfill would be so well implemented that it would become a must
stop for donors and visiting Bank officials, a place to educate the local children and the wider
community on SWM values--triggering a change in the local culture towards SWM. Even fewer
would have expected significant Israeli-Palestinian cooperation in this area. Fewer still would
have expected the Israelis to have formally approved the location of temporary dumpsites during
the ZAF landfill construction--which they did!
3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
a)      Summary of the Beneficiary Assessment: In order to assess the impact on the target
population, a beneficiary assessment (BA) was conducted by consultants contracted by the JSC
in October 2009. This sought to obtain information from a range of stakeholders. Three types of
questionnaires were prepared and applied as follows: i) individual citizens living in the original
Jenin/Tubas service area (106 persons, both men and women); ii) LGUs (17 out of an expanded
set of 82 served by the project) and iii) landfill workers. The survey lacked a proper baseline and
had to rely largely on "snapshot impressions. Also, the methodology was not always clear.
Nevertheless a number of useful conclusions may be drawn--albeit tentatively.
       Some Specific Findings: i) Public awareness, collection and tariffs: Only 31 percent of
respondents knew about the project, largely residents in the ZAF neighborhood. However, 62 percent of
respondents interviewed believed that the SW collection has improved, and 89 percent were committed to
paying the SWM tariff; ii) Collection efficiency and street cleanliness: About 50 percent of respondents
thought that the streets had become cleaner, while about 25 percent believed that there was no change and
25 percent believed that the situation has become worse; iii) Closing of uncontrolled dumpsites, and
health: 97 percent of respondents supported the closing of the dumpsites. 71 percent believed that the
project has contributed to ending or reducing the open burning of solid waste, and 60 percent believe that
the health status of the community has improved; iv) LGUs and SW service coverage: 59 percent of
LGUs indicated that SWM coverage in their area did not change, 23 percent experienced an increase in
SWM coverage, and 11 percent a decrease. However the service is held in high regard by municipal
leaders and they believe that the public have high confidence in the reliability of waste collection and

                                                                                                       12
would resist any return to previous practices. Further, the leaders point out that 56 LGUs are now
represented in JSC, and several more are seeking to join; and v) Landfill workers: The workers, for their
part, seemed to need to be better informed about the larger purposes of the project and to feel more
involved.
        General Conclusions and Recommendations: The BA consultants concluded that the project had
been generally successful with the public at large as well as the LGUs. The latter were particularly
appreciative of the service and several current non-participants are now anxious to join. Furthermore, the
public on the whole thought that the SWM service had improved and seemed willing to pay the increased
tariffs charged. However, the public needs to be much better informed about the project, and needed a
formal mechanism to express their concerns about aspects of the landfill as well as the service. (Further
details of the BA are presented in Annex 5.)
b)       Summary of Stakeholder Workshop Findings: A widely attended workshop was held
in Ramallah on November 12, 2009. The minutes of the workshop are attached at Annex 6. In
general, the participants agreed that: i) project objectives were realistic and were in agreement
with the project assessment and rating--including the HS with respect to the PDO; ii) the project
had significantly improved service delivery and the quality of environment in their communities,
and had become a prototype to be replicated in other governorates; iii) the lessons identified
were relevant and appropriate. However, they expressed concern about the lack of adequate
external monitoring by EQA, and some of the recent complaints regarding noxious odors
supposedly issuing from the new landfill. In response to the latter, the PIU manager and the Bank
task manager explained that i) a recent meeting had been held with complainants to discuss the
issue; ii) a committee had been established to review the situation and report back on the
complaints; iii) the preliminary evidence indicates that the landfill was not responsible; and iv)
that there were several other potential contributory sources.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
While currently the risks to development outcomes appear minimal, there can be no such rating
respect to any project in WBG. Political and military clashes are always looming on the horizon.
Further, the potential for negative intra-Palestinian and inter-municipal rivalries is well known.
Any one of the above could have a serious negative effect on the sustainability of the
development outcome. In addition, there is no guarantee that the PIU will continue to manage
effectively, or that a serious economic downturn will not make tariff collection problematic--
throwing the current rosy financial and economic outlook for the landfill into disarray. It is
impossible to predict the probabilities of any of the above negative impacts. However, some
prudent steps are advisable. These include i) training the next generation of JSC and PIU
leadership; ii) further strengthening PIU organization and operations; iii) preparing a realistic
management plan for the next 5 years or so; iv) establishing an appropriate, efficient and
sustainable performance monitoring framework; v) expanding and institutionalizing the public
awareness programs and strengthening public feedback mechanisms; and vi) creating incentives
for continued good performance. One possible incentive for the JSC is the possibility of
increased earnings from the conversion of landfill waste to bio-gas on a commercial scale--a
possibility which is currently being explored. On the positive side, Israeli environmental and
military authorities appear to be fully supportive of ZAF, seeing it as a significant and mutually
beneficial achievement.xxiv Rating: M

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1     Bank Performance

                                                                                                       13
(a)      Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry: Bank performance at appraisal was
satisfactory. Apart from the issue of indicator specificity, the key weaknesses at the lending stage
were over-optimism regarding the time needed for the preparation of the detailed design of the
sanitary landfill component; ambiguity concerning the indicators and lack of specificity on
intermediate monitoring targets; and over-optimism on the rate of disbursement. Also, given the
status of preparation of the sanitary landfill design at appraisal--it was supposed to have been
ready to go to bid in September 2000 but was not--it seems quite unlikely that the Bank could
have disbursed totals of US$3m by December 2001 and US$7.5m by December 2003--which
was the original plan. This rate of disbursement seems unlikely even if the Intifada did not
intervene. On balance however, as already noted the weaknesses identified, though not
insignificant, do not outweigh the considerable strengths of the technical and institutional
preparation at appraisal. Rating: S
(b)      Quality of Supervision: Given the extremely difficult operating environment, Bank
supervision performance is deemed generally satisfactory and excellent in a few areas. On few
occasions Bank staff were unable to visit the project site in Jenin. Similarly, JSC/PIU personnel
were unable to travel outside of Jenin for meetings. In addition, on a few occasions HQ-based
Bank supervision staff were even unable to obtain visas to visit WBG. Despite the difficulties,
the Bank supervision team managed to provide strong and continuous support to the JSC/PIU in
helping to resolve problems throughout. They were flexible in agreeing to changes in the project
to achieve the PDO. They were responsive to initiatives from the JSC, for example, with respect
to emergency damage repair creation; to hire Israeli landfill consultants; to invite Nablus and
Tulkarem municipalities to join in; and to embark on recycling pilots. They also took the
initiative in disseminating information about the project to other municipalities, to ministries, and
to other donors. Importantly, the on-ground supervision team opened up and maintained a
continuous and cordial dialogue with Israeli environmental and military authorities that
facilitated the movement of project related people and goods at critical junctures, and probably
protected the project from much greater harassment and possible damage--if not complete
termination. On the negative side, EQA seems to have disappeared off the supervision map.
Nevertheless, the negatives pale in comparison to the positives. (Annex 2.3 summarizes the
Bank's monitoring and reporting experience.) Rating: S
(c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance: Overall Bank performance is
deemed satisfactory based on the satisfactory preparation and supervision stages. Rating: S

5.2      Borrower Performance
(a)      Government Performance: The Governments performance is adjudged to be
satisfactory. Though details are lacking, it appears that the three key government agencies
MOLG, the MOF and EQAxxv) were very supportive during project preparation. In particular: i)
MOLG was instrumental in establishing the Jenin JSC through the Local Government Law of
1997; ii) EQA was instrumental in promoting the passage of the new Environment law in 2000;
and iii) another public agency the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and
Reconstruction (PECDAR) was instrumental in providing initial support to the JSC/PIU for
office accommodation, equipment and the installation of the financial management systems
necessary to efficiently manage the project. Implementation: During implementation i) MOLG
were very supportive, though relatively passive in the latter stages; and ii) the MOF played a key
role in on-lending the credit proceeds to the JSC and in supporting the acquisition of land for the
new landfill site.xxvi. Further, MOF responded admirably to the needs of the PIU, and strongly

                                                                                                  14
supported their requests for rescheduling of closing dates and reallocations of funds where
necessary to achieve project objectives. In fact, as noted the Minister of Finance himself visited
the site on a number of occasions, was highly impressed, and thereafter became one of the main
champions of the project--apparently seeing it as a good example of what Palestinians can
achieve when they set their minds to it. Further, the Jenin Governor was very supportive, helping
to mobilize support for landfill participation by other governorates and to clear implementation
bottlenecks. Rating: S
(b)      Implementing Agency Performance: There were two implementing agencies JSC and
EQA. JSC was responsible for 95 percent of the Bank share of the project and achieving the key
project objectives, and they performed extremely well as has been extensively documented
above. On the other hand, EQA, who were only responsible for only 5 percent of the project cost,
did not perform up to expectations. While they did considerable work in improving public
awareness and undertaking emergency job creation in Gaza, they did not achieve very much with
respect to the key tasks of capacity building and environmental monitoring.xxvii Given the
dominant weight of the JSC in achieving the PDO and its very good implementation
performance, overall agency performance is deemed highly satisfactory. Rating: HS
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance: Overall borrower
performance is rated satisfactory. This is based on the outstanding performance of the JSC--the
key implementing agency; the good performance of the Government agencies at preparation; and
the highly supportive performance of the Jenin Governorate and the MOF in the middle and later
stages of project implementation. Rating: S

6.      Lessons Learned
Eight key lessons may be cited out of the several learned. Most go beyond the particular sector
and WBG situation and speak to project development in both normal and conflict situations.
i)       In conflict situations, it is advisable to seek out and build upon the common interests that often
exist beneath the heat and rhetoric. This can sometimes open up previously unforeseen possibilities for
cooperation. One of the key insights of the Bank preparation team was that Israelis were as interested as
the Palestinians in ensuring effective environmental control and hence the success of the project. Building
on this knowledge, the team took the necessary steps of closely consulting the Israeli military and
environmental authorities, promoting dialogue among technical specialists on both sides, and keeping the
channels of communication open even at the height of conflict. Without these the project may not have
taken off much less successfully survived the conflict.xxviii
ii)      Local ownership is more critical for project success than is often recognized. Local ownership is
often taken for granted as a self-evident prerequisite for project success. Beyond this, it is often not paid
much attention during project preparation. However, without unusually strong ownership and leadership
on the part of the Jenin JSC and PIU the project would probably have failed. The key actions of the JSC
and the PIU have already been described in the previous sections 2.2, 3.2 and 5.2 (b), and are thus not
repeated here, except to say that this was the JSC's project, not the Bank's, and they were prepared to take
difficult decisions when needed.
iii)     Individuals can and do make a major difference to project success; thus seeking out and strongly
supporting capable local professionals is advisable. The issue of leadership goes beyond the structure and
operational role of the PIU and the relationship between the JSC and the PIU. There seems to be a general
consensus that PIU manger was a key motive force behind project success. To quote from a recent
discussion with the Bank-team leader at appraisal: "Hani", the PIU manager, "is responsible for a high
percent of the success of the project".xxix Further these individuals often have significant tacit (local
situational) knowledge that can be tapped/mobilized to effectively support a project. For example JSC and
PIU leaders knew a great deal about negative impact of the unsanitary disposals sites, the collection


                                                                                                          15
capacity and practices of the LGUs; and local attitudes towards waste disposal and cost recovery, etc., and
were thus able to help focus the project and enhance the possibilities for success. A further example is
that the Israeli consultant hired by the JSCxxx proved far more effective in finding efficient and practical
solutions for the landfill design issue than the foreign experts.
iv)      Effective channels of public communication and feedback support sustainability and can and
should be built into project design. While public education was a key component of the project was
generally successful, the feedback from the public on service quality, area cleanliness, etc., is proving
very effective in forcing the JSC to be vigilant and responsive to public complaints. This is helping to
improve/maintain service quality, thus improving the chances of project sustainability.
v)       Investment in changing the culture is often as important as physical investments, and sometimes
more so: Though difficult to specify before hand and often the result of luck--as partly in this case--
these investments make it difficult for a return to bad habits and practices and thus strongly support
project sustainability.
vi)      SWM can serve as an effective entry point for improving municipal management and service
delivery: The sector is highly visible, often neglected, and the potential negative impacts obvious to the
public. However, efficient solution requires institutional cooperation in waste collection and disposal--
hence the need for an effective JSC. However, once formed, an effective JSC provides an excellent venue
for addressing other municipal and inter-municipal issues.
vii)     Early preparation, consensus building and "learning" can pay significant dividends. The project
learned from earlier initiatives in middle Gaza and the formation of a JSC for SWM; and from earlier
Bank-supported projects. The technical, environmental and social studies and workshops supported by
these and other donor investments not only explored the policy and technical dimensions of the SWM
problem, they also helped establish the feasibility of the project; helped disseminate knowledge; helped
build consensus and promote dialogue among authorities and technical specialist on both the Palestinian
and Israeli sides. This helped to ensure that the JSC when formed was relatively well informed on
environmental and managerial issues and could hit the ground running. Early investment in donor
participation also paid significant dividends in later support. The Bank preparation team's efforts in
bringing in other donors--particularly the EU and the Italians--very early in the project preparation cycle
later helped in burden sharing and mobilizing necessary financial and technical support for the project.
viii)    Consistent, thoughtful, and dedicated on-ground Bank supervision support can be the difference
between success and failure. Despite the political and military conflict, the on-ground Bank supervision
team managed to maintain close and very supportive contact with the PIU and the JSC. They also played
a pivotal role in opening up and keeping the dialogue going with both the Israeli military and civilian
authorities even at the height of the conflict--providing critical space for project implementation. Without
this the project might have failed.

7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/ Partners
(a)     Borrower/implementing agencies: The summary of the JSC/PIU's report is presented in
Annex 7. This summary is part of a much more extensive document that is too large to be
incorporated into this ICR. The report notes the project objectives; the background to, formation,
objectives and operation of the JSC; the challenges faced implementation under very difficult
conditions; the measures taken to close dumpsites and develop the new landfill; the
characteristics of the landfill design; the public information program; the structure and operations
of the PIU; and much more. It indicates that the JSC/PIU are very proud of what has been
accomplished, and are very appreciative of Bank and EU's assistance in making the project
possible. The full EQA report is presented in Annex 7. To summarize, the project registered a lot
of progress since its launch despite the difficulty of the situation in the WBG and the continuous
closure and the siege imposed by the Israeli military forces since September 2000. Additionally
the project faced many obstacles since the Palestinian elections in 2006 and the closure of EQA

                                                                                                         16
office in Gaza in 2007. On the other hand during project implementation, nearly most of the
foreseen objectives either fully or partially achieved. The raising awareness and monitoring
objectives were partially implemented. Nevertheless, additional tasks, related to emergency
employment generation and technical support to Anabta SWEMP, have been achieved.
(b)     Cofinanciers: The EU was the only cofinancier. Their comments are presented in full in
Annex 8. In these comments the EU notes that the ".... landfill ("Zahrat Al-Finjan" site) marks a
turning point in the solid waste management sector in the West Bank", and goes on to note the
project's several positive environmental and social impacts. However they also note a number of
problems with specification and operation of the equipment acquired using EU funds.

Annex 3.       Economic and Financial Analysis
This assessment was carried out by Dr. Philip Rushbrook, an Environmental Economist who was
contracted by the Bank ICR team. Due to his vast expertise in this sector, his assessment extends
beyond the economic sustainability to include technical review of the SWM operation.

Overall Findings
The Jenin Joint Services Council (JSC) has developed a modern and regular waste collection
service. It has earned the trust of residents in the northern West Bank and by example is
attracting more communities prepared to pay higher tariffs for a reliable waste service. In
general, households pay ~US$ 4/month compared to about US$ 1/month for pre-SWEMP
services. Public opinion is firmly behind municipalities continuing to provide the JSC waste
service and residents are unlikely to tolerate a return to open dumping or irregular collection. The
sanitary landfill at ZAF is an exemplary operation and the team in place is competent to maintain
the operation.
JSC has developed a responsive Management Board structure to reflect the diverse range of size
and prosperity within its 56 member communities. The PIU responsible for implementation of
the IDA-funded credit activities, has direct access to decision makers on the Management Board
through its influential chief executive and knowledgeable technical team.
The project objectives to create a modern waste collection and disposal service, generate public
support and build technical and financial sustainability have been achieved. This is an impressive
outcome and the project participants should be congratulated. Furthermore, the core
achievements of the project to build solid support from municipal leaders, a streamlined
management structure, public support for new services, careful financial control, reliable revenue
generation and sound technical capabilities approach should be reproducible elsewhere in the
West Bank and the MENA region.
There is a risk the JSC waste service may become too successful with the commencement of
disposal of waste at the ZAF site from Nablus and elsewhere. JSC handles waste from about
600,000 residents in northern West Bank, up to three times the initial intention to provide a
service for about 200,000. On aspect of this rise in demand is that landfill lifetime would be
exhausted sooner than expected, say 15 to 20 years. Consequently, further landfill capacity may
need to be financed before the end of the present IDA credit repayments. Other options such as
increased recycling and waste diversion to extend landfill lifetime are also being pursued by the
PIU. In October 2009, the JSC signed an agreement with the private sector to establish a
recycling and composting facility at the landfill site.
The audited financial position of the JSC after its first full year of trading (2008) appears healthy.
A small operating loss of less than 1 percent of total expenditure was offset by a large reported
cash surplus. Late payments from municipalities are running at 23 percent. Nevertheless, peer
pressure between municipalities is high and the PIU has found with increasing experience the
final payment rate is much higher. Projections for 2009 from monthly operating cost records and
revenue billings to municipalities indicate an overall trading surplus. This, combined with cash
reserves in the bank, enable IDA credit repayment of US$ 180,000 to be serviced adequately
from 2010.



                                                                                                   21
The JSC business model appears robust. An IRR of 43 percent was achieved assuming full
revenue recovery from municipalities (and the present indications are this is achievable),
conservative replacement costs for vehicles and landfill equipment, foreseeable further landfill
engineering and known credit repayments. Sensitivity was examined to a 10 percent rise in costs,
a 10 percent reduction in collection efficiency and where both occur. In these cases the IRR
values remained between 32 and 22 percent. It is only when a 20 percent decrease in collections
is accompanied by a 10 percent rise in cost that the IRR falls to zero. Thus the JSC operation is
more sensitive to collection efficiency than to cost increases as predicted in the 2000 Project
Appraisal Document, but this sensitivity is not as acute.
Attention has to be given to ensuring sufficient reserves are available to finance new collection
vehicles and cover planned and unplanned landfill engineering works. Costs presented in audited
accounts have been controlled well in 2008 and providing there are no excessive external cost
pressures future increases in waste tariffs should be modest. The precise tariff charged to each
municipality varies to reflect the type of collection and/or disposal service they receive from JSC
and the haulage distance to ZAF. The average cost to municipalities in 2008 was US$ 14/ton.
Dumpsite rehabilitation has been highly successful with 39 areas cleared. Thirty have been
redeveloped for productive use, four given over for social use as parks and five returned to
natural land.
The Environmental Quality Authority has benefited from capacity-building under the terms of
the credit. Much of this work was on internal training and salaries. Capacity has been built in
design reviews, office support services and reporting. Little capacity in regulatory inspection or
environmental monitoring has been developed. The absence of laboratory facility and national
standards for waste facilities were cited as drawbacks.

Summary
The SWEMP is regarded as an exemplary solid waste management project. The JSC waste
service delivered by the PIU was found to be a confident, competent and financially sound
operation. It should be acknowledged as achieving an impressive set of outcomes:

   -   A very well run collection and disposal operation with a strong management team,
       regular access to municipal leaders in the JSC and sound technical capabilities
   -   A sound business model resulting in a well financed operation, achieving sustainable
       revenue streams, good cost control and an IRR resilient to credible financial and
       operational variations
   -   Strong municipal and public support for the reliable collection arrangements put in place
       and the quality of the ZAF landfill operation
   -   A tolerable service cost to residents, paid for as a small proportion of the electricity pre-
       payment system
   -   Strong demand from residents and leaders in other municipalities to join the JSC service
   -   An extensive dump clearance program completed where the majority of sites are now
       used or earmarked for agricultural, development or recreational purposes.

              Solid Waste and Environmental Management Project (SWEMP)
1. Background

The overall objective of the SWMEP has been to implement an improved, environmentally sound solid
waste management system for Jenin district and latterly, an increasing number of surrounding
municipalities and communities. The intention to improve solid waste management on the West Bank
began in 1998 when the World Bank financed a feasibility study focusing on the prevailing situation in
Jenin and Hebron Districts.
In 2000 an IDA credit of $ 9.5 million was approved for the Jenin district SWEMP. It consisted
of three components:

      1. The construction of a sanitary landfill and rehabilitation of numerous uncontrolled
         dumpsites
      2. Commencement of regular waste collection and provision of landfill machinery and
         other vehicles
      3. Raise awareness in communities of waste-related risks and build capacity within the
         environmental authorities

The IDA credit covered components 1 and 3 and specified repayments will begin after 10 years,
i.e. 2010 and should be completed by 2040. Between 2010 and 2020 repayment is based on 2
percent pa of the capital sum outstanding and thereafter at 4 percent pa between 2020 and 2040.
Finance for the second component was provided as a grant from the European Union.

The JSC set up a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) to manage the development of the new
sanitary landfill and to operate a new waste collection system on behalf of the municipalities
within the JSC. The PIU now collects waste from most member municipalities and has
established a tariff of changes based on the collection and waste delivery arrangement agreed
with each one.

Progress on implementation began slowly due to a deteriorating security situation in 2002 and
consequent restrictions on the ability of organizations to undertake development work. Municipal
support for the project remained firm and following and improvement in the security situation
the JSC purchased of the ZAF site. Design and construction of the ZAF landfill began in 2005,
with completion and first waste received in June 2007. The landfill occupies about 185,000 m2
whereas the size of the whole site is about 2,400,000 m2. Consequently, there is sufficient
additional land for future extensions to the landfill operation. The constructed capacity of about
2.9 million m3 is estimated to have a life of 15 to 20 years dependent upon the rate of filling (say,
for present inputs of about 135,000 tons per annum, volume utilization of about 150,000 m3 pa
is a realistic assumption).

In parallel to the improvement of waste management services, initially US$500,000 (later
reduced to US$400,000) was made available to the national Environmental Quality Authority.
The purpose was to raise the Authority's capacity in the field of waste management to ensure a
good standard of environmental protection was built into the landfill design and subsequently
maintained through inspections and advice. They also undertook to increase the awareness of
local residents to the risks of indiscriminate waste disposal and associated health risks.


                                                                                                   23
The credit implementation period has ended and the focus is now on ensuring the long term
technical and financial sustainability of the project investments.

2. Approach to the Assessment
The time available to undertake the mission was short. Therefore, it was decided at the outset to
focus the field visits on gathering information for a realistic review of the financial and technical
sustainability of the achievements delivered by the SWEMP. This, in turn, enabled a reasoned
opinion to be formed on the likelihood of the IDA credit to be repaid when payments fall due
from 2010.
Two days were available for field visits to the Jenin area of the West Bank. This was a very short
period and it was appreciated this would be insufficient to gather an in-depth examination of the
merits and issues. Instead, the assessment has drawn upon information gathered in the time
available from key project personnel, the auditor's report and recent and previous reports from
World Bank missions and West Bank organizations involved in the Project.

The assessment report was completed following the field visits and assimilation of the
information received.

3. Assessment Findings
Municipal Commitment to JSC
Key points:

      The JSC waste service is held in high regard by municipal leaders

      No municipality of dominant size to control collective decision-making by the JSC Management
       Board

      Direct involvement each month by the PIU in Management Board meetings

      High public confidence in the reliability of waste collection and resistance to return to previous
       practices

      Fifty-six communities are now in the JSC with more seeking to join and, together with separate
       arrangements for more distant municipalities; the JSC now provides waste collection and/or
       disposal facilities for about 600,000 inhabitants.

The establishment of the Jenin JSC was instrumental in building consensus between
communities in the northern West Bank. Most notably, it was able to devise a Management
Board and governance structure to represent the interests of the communities of differing size
and local circumstances. The apparent absence of a dominant member or groupings has
permitted a relatively swift decision-making process and general unity between communities to
accept higher tariffs in turn for improved waste services.

Strikingly, the PIU has been success in overcoming initial skepticism from municipal leaders and
built up strong public confidence by maintaining reliable waste collection from residential areas
over the past two years. Municipal leaders in Jenin and Ya'bad commented that public attitudes


                                                                                                      24
towards waste appear to have changed permanently and citizens probably would not tolerate a
return to unreliable waste collection or open dumping

The JSC has achieved public and political recognition for improved waste collection and
disposal operations in 56 municipalities/communities. Six other municipalities dispose of waste
at the landfill but are not members of the Jenin JSC. With a recent addition of waste from Nablus
and Qalqiliya cities (neither members of the Jenin JSC) arriving for disposal at the ZAF landfill,
it is estimated by JSC the SWEMP now benefits approximately 600,000 residents in the northern
West Bank.

The JSC has established a 20-strong Management Board that meets monthly to oversees the
waste collection and disposal service and decide on major operational and strategic issues
including waste service tariffs. It is the subsequent responsibility of each municipality to levy
charges on the households in their area (typically as part of electricity prepayment). The JSC
Management Board is regarded by leaders as representative of the wide range of community and
municipal administrations across the northern West Bank. It is also said by the JSC's Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) senior staff to be effective at making decisions at its monthly
meetings

Municipal leaders in Jenin and Ya'bad expressed a high regard for the quality of technical
operations achieved by the PIU and commented that residents are prepared to pay the
municipalities for the collection service they now receive. However, some municipalities believe
the collection and disposal tariffs levied by the PIU are high and have an adverse impact on their
municipal budgets. Recent tariff reductions were mentioned by the PIU following pressure from
the Management Board to reflect reductions in the cost of fuel. This was regarded as a temporary
adjustment and PIU recognizes it is important to take a long term view to waste management
financing and the expectation is tariffs will rise modestly in the future.

It was mentioned in conversations in PIU and the EQA that the waste service has become
synonymous in the northern West Bank with environmental improvement: a positive and
commendable outcome. This is further endorsed by further requests to the JSC from other
municipalities to join the waste service.

Financial Adequacy
Key points:
      The first full year of operation (2008) was close to breakeven in its income with respect to its
       annual operating cost

      A notable cash surplus is reported in the annual accounts. This sum is likely to grow and is
       sufficient to cover unplanned engineering expenses and IDA credit repayments from 2010 at 2
       percent (US$180,000 pa)

Financial accounts
The first full year of operation following the opening of the ZAF landfill and rationalization of
JSC collection operations was 2008. The audited accounts and 2008 were used in this brief
assessment. In 2008 JSC made a small trading loss of US$10,621 (0.6 percent) against total
revenues of US$1,910,251 and total operating expenditures of US$1,920,872. This loss is not

                                                                                                    25
regarded as significant as late payments from some municipalities were received in 2009. To
achieve a balanced operating cost account in the first full year of operation is a good
achievement.

 Total revenues                               1,910,251                      424,426
 Total expenditure                            1,920,872                      901,253
 Difference                                    (10,621)                     (476,827)

 Cash in hand/at bank at end of year           677,117                       494,051

The `disposal revenues' portion (US$1,699,103) of total revenues in the 2008 audited accounts
are understood to represent about a 77 percent recovery rate of the waste charges billed to
municipalities. If these outstanding accounts are recovered then the first year of full operation
would show a healthy trading surplus (about US$390,000). This sum would provide a trading
surplus sufficient to readily service the IDA credit repayments at 2 percent from 2010
(US$180,000). If all else remains equal, then it would also be sufficient to cover credit
repayments at the higher 4 percent pa from 2020 (US$360,000).

The JSC has accrued a strong cash surplus in its accounts in both 2007 (US$494,051) and 2008
(US$677,117). The sources of this cash surplus were not ascertained but are understood to
include transfers from municipalities in previous years and retained cash from investment and
municipal sources. The surplus rose by US$183,066 between 2007 and 2008. The principal
source of this increase is described in the 2008 JSC accounts as a surplus cash inflow from
`financing activities' not operational activities. This should be monitored.

Economic Analyses: Supporting Data and Explanations
It was recognized by the JSC and Bank staff that the economic basis for the operations of the
PIU at Jenin JSC have changed considerably since the commencement of the project. In the
original PAD in 2000 it is believed the following assumptions were applied:

      A 15 year time horizon, with the base year as 2000
      The full IDA credit of $9.5m applied to the waste management and collection service led
       by the Jenin JSC
      Total benefits over the 15 year period of $38m and total costs of $32m
      No further capital investments in collection vehicles, landfill equipment and engineering
       works at ZAF after the utilization of the IDA credit
      The initial waste system from JSC provided to about 200,000 inhabitants
      80 percent payment rate of invoices by municipalities by the fourth year (Year 0 = 20
       percent, Year 1 = 40 percent, Year 2 = 60 percent, Year 3 = 80 percent)
      IDA credit repayments based on 2 percent pa for 10 years from 2010 and 4 percent for 20
       year thereafter
      Sensitivity analyses of the payment rate at 90 percent and 70 percent cost recovery


                                                                                                    26
These original assumptions were compared with data from the 2008 audited accounts for JSC to
examine their relationship to the original project appraisal. Whilst the comparison was a similar
as possible some differences are inevitable, in particular the tight control exerted over costs and a
larger than expected number of municipalities paying for waste to go to ZAF.

These cost differences are presented in Table 2.

Table 2: Total revenue and expenditure estimates for the PAD assumptions using 2000
estimated data and 2008 actual data
                                                                                  2009 mission

Total revenues                     38                          30.8                    41.8
Total expenditure                  32                          28.4                    30.7

The IRR values for the base case and sensitivity analyses at 90 and 70 percent cost recovery
show the spread of the IRR percentages are wide with the 2008 data than originally expected in
the 2000 PAD (Table 3). They indicate that using the original PAD assumptions the project
remains feasible but is slightly more sensitive to a decline in the payment rate than originally
expected. However, the 2009 mission found the original 2000 PAD assumptions are no longer a
realistic representation of the situation found during the 2009 mission. Therefore, a new set of
assumptions were developed that provide a fairer and more accurate representation of the
prevailing conditions in the northern part of the West Bank.

90% cost recovery                               11.6%                            26%
Base case (80% cost recovery)                    7.6%                            12%
70% cost recovery                                2.8%                             0%

To address the changing circumstances underlying the project, a broader economic analysis was
undertaken. In particular, waste collection and disposal has increased rapidly to service around
600,000 inhabitants and the total income from municipalities has risen considerably, whilst
operating costs have been contained successfully (Table2). Prompt payment rates by
municipalities are 77 percent and intensive peer pressure amongst municipalities has ensured the
remaining invoices are paid too. Therefore, total cost recovery is reported to be very high. To
reflect this situation a 90 percent repayment rate has been used in the base case. The Jenin JSC is
also holding a sizeable cash surplus based on the 2008 audit (US$677,000). In addition, the total
IDA credit to be repaid by the JSC has reduced to $8.6m through design changes, with the
remaining $0.9m to be paid by other bodies within the Palestinian Authority. Consequently, the
following assumptions were used to more closely reflect the present operating situation for Jenin
JSC:

      A 15 year time horizon, with the base year as 2008, using audited data

80% payment recovery                                32%                                 22%
70% payment recovery                                17%                                  0%

The JSC business model appears robust. Its sensitivity to a 10 percent and 20 percent reduction in
collection efficiency appears low, with IRR values of 32 percent and 17 percent respectively.
Furthermore in more constrained conditions where both collection efficiency declines by 10 percent and
operating costs rise by 10 percent, the IRR is still 22 percent. It is only when a 20 percent decline in
collection efficiency is supplemented with a 10 percent cost increase that the IRR drops to 0 percent.
The JSC operation is more sensitive to collection efficiency than cost rises, as predicted in the 2000 PAD
cost assumptions, but this sensitivity is less acute than originally estimated.

Tariffs: The JSC appear to have developed a realistic tariff structure for those municipalities (22
at the present time) that pay for waste collection and/or disposal on a per ton basis. A variable
charging rate has been negotiated with each municipality reflecting the cost of collection,
transport distance to landfill, transfer cost where necessary and disposal cost. Collection and
disposal combined fees vary between NIS 27/t and NIS 100/t (about 7.2 and 26.7 US$/t
respectively). This range of tariff prices represents a wide spread over the average cost for waste
handled by JSC at US$14 /t (i.e. total expenditure in 2008 US$1,920,872 / 135,000 t/y). For
those municipalities undertaking their own collection and haulage a gate fee is charged on a
disposal only basis (about US$ 8/t).
Other municipalities (40) have negotiated a monthly lump sum payment irrespective of tonnages
received. These are mainly but not solely smaller communities and the rationale for this different
charging arrangement is not known.

                                                                                                        28
Future expenditures: Sufficient financial reserves need to be maintained into the future, to
replace the ageing waste collection vehicle fleet. Ensuring the maintenance of a regular waste
collection service is the central feature of the JSC operation in the view of residents. This is the
primary justification for the higher tariffs charged to municipalities than their previous level of
expenditure for open dumping. In addition, future expenditures on vehicle and landfill equipment
replacement, together with planned (e.g. landfill gas venting) and unplanned (e.g. slope failures,
pollution events) civil engineering works at the landfill will need to be financed to maintain the
availability of the waste service.
It is also noted that provision for financing new landfill design and construction will be
necessary, given that at present filling rates the existing landfill will be full in 15 to 20 years and
well before the full repayment of the credit due in 2040. Further revenue-generating landfill
capacity will need to be developed between 2022 and 2027. Alternatively, it is understood that a
major recycling facility is planned by a private contractor, which, if successful, would divert at
least 50 percent of the waste from ZAF and potentially double the remaining landfill lifetime to
around the time of completion of credit repayments.

The operational lifetimes assumed for collection vehicles (10 years) and landfill equipment (7
years) are longer than usual and a clear vehicle replacement program is required to ensure the
longer term sustainability of the waste service. Depreciation periods 7 years for collection
vehicles and 5 years for landfill equipment would be more realistic.

Assessment of Technical Capability by the Environmental Economist Consultant
1. Disposal Operations
Key points:
       A sanitary landfill of good design has been constructed and modern landfill equipment has been
        provided

       The site addresses the technical requirements to deposit wastes carefully, isolate from
        surrounding geology and control environmental releases as suggested in World Bank guidance

       The PIU has a knowledgeable engineering team interested and committed to operating the site to
        a good standard

       The constructed landfill has capacity, at present rates of filling, for 15 to 20 years and further
        space is available at the ZAF site for future extensions

       Routine environmental monitoring of groundwater and the presence of-site of landfill gas should
        be instigated.

    Personnel: A trained and qualified engineering capability based at the ZAF sanitary landfill
    is present in the JSC's PIU management team. During site visits and in discussions the
    management and engineering personnel demonstrated a sound knowledge of modern waste
    landfill methods. Since the landfill began receiving wastes in mid-2007 they have
    implemented a good standard of controlled waste placement.




                                                                                                       29
Design: The landfill has been well designed and constructed. Improvements, initiated by the
PIU at the design stage, on the site's position and layout to avoid the construction of a culvert
were sensible and saved considerable capital expenditure.
The site has capacity for about 2.9 million m3 of waste and is arranged in four cells. Cells 1
and 2 are in operation at present and, at the present rate of waste filling, have an estimated
life of about 7.5-10 years. Cells 3 and 4 are similar in size and would provide about 7.5-10
years of further landfill lifetime. Fortunately, JSC purchased a larger land area than presently
required and plans to extend operations across the site in due course.
Operations: The standard of waste tipping operation observed was high. One of the best seen
in a middle income economy. The approximate monthly waste tonnage received at the ZAF
landfill is 11,000t, equating to about 250,000t of municipal waste deposited in the last two
years. This monthly rate of input tallies well with weighbridge data seen for July and August
2009.
Waste is being deposited at the tip face in a controlled manner, i.e. all incoming waste is
weighed; drivers are directed where to empty their loads; a small working face is maintained,
bulldozer used to spread waste in about 1m layers; periodically a specialized landfill
compactor compacts the waste; and the spreading and compacting process is repeated to
build up two-meter lifts. The site is currently filling its sixth lift.
The PIU staff said they accomplish a high waste emplacement density of 1 t/m3. No landfill
survey data was presented to verify this figure but after observing site operations a
reasonably high initial density (0.8 t/m3 or higher) is likely to be achieved. Subsequent rapid
degradation of the high organic content in the incoming waste will further improve over time
the final density of landfill wastes. Waste is covered each day with at least 15cm of soil cover
and temporary haul roads are constructed from rock and soil to facilitate access for collection
vehicles to reach the tipping face. Soil cover usage is liberal and could possibly be reduced
without loss of protection by experimenting with reduced thicknesses and observing if
continued odor suppression is achieved. Excessive use of cover material, over time, has an
adverse impact on site volume and hence, landfill lifetime.
No evidence of fly or rodent infestations were observed during the site visit and no elevated
levels of pungent odors were encountered. Only occasional traces of smell from fermenting
wastes were noted during waste emptying from collection vehicles.
It was noted that scavenging for plastic is undertaken by pickers working at the tipping face.
It is understood these are JSC staff and the plastic is taken to a compound at the landfill for
washing and chipping. It was reported that two tons of plastic chips are exported from the
site each day. This figure was not checked but appears high given the type of plastics
processing equipment in use.
Leachate and Gas Management: Leachate can be collected from the landfill and passed into
a leachate lagoon before being re-circulated back periodically through the landfill to undergo
further microbial decomposition. The PIU reported there have been no uncontrolled releases
of leachate to surface watercourses, suggesting quantities of leachate re-circulated are being
managed responsibly. Leachate in the lagoon appears relatively dilute and was not seen to be

                                                                                              30
   out-gassing or have a black, organic-rich coloration. This suggests the conditions for
   microbial decomposition within the landfill are satisfactory and sustained methanogenic
   degradation of the deposited waste has been achieved.
   Leachate is not monitored in the two groundwater monitoring points installed near the
   landfill. This should be rectified. The PIU plan to begin groundwater and leachate lagoon
   monitoring on a monthly basis with analyses performed at a local university. Details on the
   parameters to be measured were not provided. No environmental monitoring of operations is
   undertaken by the environmental regulator, EQA and there is no mechanism at the present
   time to set an environmental permit for landfill operations.
   The presence of sustained methanogenic degradation in the landfill could not be verified
   directly. No landfill gas monitoring wells have been constructed and no gas testing takes
   place at the landfill. Gas monitoring at the PIU office and maintenance facility should be
   undertaken as a safety as these are below the height of the landfill and may be vulnerable to
   gas accumulation if the site containment is breached. Smoking on the landfill should be
   prohibited to avoid the possibility of igniting a gas pocket or the waste itself. The PIU said
   they may construct gas wells in the future if an economic use for the gas can be identified. It
   is expected well construction to prevent unplanned gas migration off-site would be required
   soon for environmental safety purposes too.
2. Collection Operations
Key Points:
      JSC has rationalized several former local collection services into a comprehensive system
       utilizing fewer vehicles with more efficient vehicle routings

      A regular collection service has been established and communities now expected this improved
       standard

      With only six recent acquisitions most of the 28 collection vehicles are in the late stages or at the
       end of their economic lifetimes

      Transfer stations have been constructed to reduce the costs of collection for areas about 20km or
       more away for the landfill

   The JSC is operating 28 collection vehicles, of which most (22) were already old when
   transferred from municipalities. Its 6 newer vehicles were provided through an EU aid grant.
   The present collection fleet is the result of a rationalization of collection routes and closure of
   inefficient local municipal waste services. As a result, the number of collection vehicles was
   reduced from 50 vehicles.
   The present fleet comprises four vehicle sizes: 3 x 4m3; 9 x 5m3; 5 x 9m3; 2 x 12m3.
   Collection is daily from larger towns and residential areas and twice or thrice weekly from
   other communities. Collection operations were not directly observed. Whilst traveling
   through the northern West Bank very few municipal waste accumulations were seen in towns
   or villages suggesting regular waste collection are being achieved successfully.
   Three two-level, top loading simple waste transfer stations have developed where waste
   collection vehicles empty their contents into larger 32m3 containers. When full the containers

                                                                                                         31
   are transported to ZAF landfill by two hook lift trucks. One new site at Jenin western villages
   was visited and the operation appeared tidy and properly used. Transferred waste is also
   brought to the landfill by municipalities (e.g. Nablus) outside the Jenin JSC area.
3. Social Benefits
Key Points:
      Improved waste services are now available to an estimated 600,000 inhabitants of the northern
       part of the West Bank
      Thirty-nine uncontrolled dumpsites, some with multiple disposal locations, were rehabilitated and
       returned to natural (5), social (4) or productive (30) use

      Rehabilitated dumpsites used for new residential development                      or   combined
       residential/smallholding use have seen their land values double or even triple.

   Improved Waste Service to Residents: Previously municipal waste either went uncollected in
   many towns and villages or undertaken by relatively unreliable systems. Waste accumulating
   closed to residential areas inevitably attracted vermin and posed an obvious risk to public
   health from communicable diseases. Irregular open burning of uncollected waste
   accumulations in residential areas was commonplace and at nearby open dumps contributes
   to poor local air quality and exacerbates respiratory disorders in vulnerable residents.
   Quantifying social benefit from improved solid waste management is difficult. However, a
   value of US$1/household/week (US$ 4/month) may be inferred by reflecting the willingness
   of most residents to pay this sum for improved waste collection as an integral part of their
   electricity tariffs.
   After-use of Closed Dumpsites: The SWEMP has been successful in closing and
   rehabilitating fifty-four separate dumping locations at 36 dumpsites. Details of the dumpsite
   locations, the fate of the recovered waste and after use are presented in Annex 2. Five sites
   were visited during the assessment and all were free from new waste accumulations. The
   most inventive use of land was children's playgrounds and parks at four places and five
   others situated close to roads were left to return eventually to natural ground. The
   overwhelming majority of locations (30) had been returned to agricultural use (15) or
   undergoing redevelopment (or close to) new housing (15).
   Where former dumpsites in communities have been cleared of waste and returned to
   agricultural land and/or suitable for new housing (i.e., about 30 locations) values per m2 were
   mentioned by local residents to have increased over 2.5 times from US$4.4-5.9 /m2 to
   US$11.8-13.2 /m2.
   Where land has been left to revert to nature (5 locations) then no financial benefit has been
   assumed although undoubtedly general improvement in the environmental status of an area
   will be achieved eventually.
   The use of rehabilitated land as parks or playgrounds (4 locations) provides a distinct social
   benefit from the general improvement of community amenities. The facilities are free at the
   present time and consequently local municipalities have taken on the responsibility for their
   maintenance and development. This additional public cost was recognized but had not been


                                                                                                     32
   quantified by the one municipality visited during the assessment. Leasing a small number of
   concession stands at the Ya'bad children's park was planned.
4. Environmental Quality Authority (EQA)  Capacity Building
Key Points:
      EQA have the responsibility to safeguard the environment
      SWEMP funds have been primarily used by Ramallah and Jenin-based staff for training courses,
       review of designs, community events, salaries and contractors

      Not all funds were utilized and about US$ 60 000 has been reimbursed to the Bank in 2009.
       Disruption within in the EQA occurred due to its financial department being based in Gaza

      Since landfill operations commenced at ZAF EQA has not built up sufficient capacity to conduct
       site inspections or environmental quality sampling

      The Palestinian Authority has not yet established limits on landfill emissions or a licensing
       system for waste facilities.

   Initially, a provision of US$500,000 was built into the credit to satisfy environmental
   concerns during landfill design, construction and operation. In 2003 the World Bank agreed
   for US$100,000 from the IDA credit to be re-directed towards emergency reconstruction of
   walls and restoration of agricultural lands in ten municipalities. This left the remaining
   US$400,000 available for the SWEMP program of activities in northern West Bank.
   These funds have been used largely for:
          Reviews of engineering and environmental studies at the design stage of the landfill

          Two rounds of community awareness raising on solid waste management

          Staff salaries

          General authority-wide capacity building delivered through training contractors and
           attendance at courses held in the West Bank and in Egypt.

   The outcomes achieved, as reported by EQA, were increased staff capacity and competence
   in general office administration, financial management, proposal and report writing and
   strategic planning. Capabilities in waste management activities included preparation of
   technical TORs for data collection and groundwater monitoring, quality assessments at some
   dumpsites before and after rehabilitation and the provision of technical support to Wadi
   Shaeer JSC. The new capabilities achieved were not evaluated during the assessment. It is
   understood that since operations commenced neither site inspections nor environmental
   quality sampling have not been conducted by EQA at the ZAF landfill.
   One area has been recognized by EQA as requiring further development in the future. No
   field or laboratory capabilities are available within the EQA for environmental sampling and
   independent inspection of waste facilities. It is unfortunate the EQA, as the environmental
   regulator, to did not use a portion of the credit to establish modest testing facilities in the
   Jenin area for environmental quality sampling.


                                                                                                  33
The role of EQA as an effective and knowledgeable regulator is hampered an absence from
the Palestinian Authority of an environmental permitting system for landfill operations or
standards on maximum permissible concentrations of waste contaminants in ground or
surface waters. EQA do not believe they are sufficiently empowered to take a lead in this
matter without the backing of regulations from the central administration.
EQA are preparing a report of their activities related to the SWEMP but this has not yet been
forwarded to the World Bank. It is noted that not all of the credit funds were utilized by EQA
and in June 2009 payments of UK 29,410 (about US$47,000) and US$12,542.20 were
remitted back to the World Bank.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Impact Assessment
5.1     Beneficiary Survey Results
Source: Beneficiary Assessment of Zahrat Al-Finjan Landfill Project, Universal Group for Engineering and
Consulting, Nablus, Palestine, October 2009.

This annex is divided into three parts: The first section (A) is a brief summary of the Beneficiary
Assessment completed in October 2009 and including main findings and lessons learned. The
second section (B) summarizes some relevant social issues from a recent independent SWEMP
assessment, and finally (c) additional lessons learned which the project team would like to
emphasize are summarized.

A)      The Beneficiary Assessment

A Beneficiary Assessment (BA) was completed in October 2009 in an effort to measure the level
of satisfaction among beneficiaries. However this exercise was only partially successful because
of lack of adequate baseline information/indicators. Changes over time were therefore difficult to
measure, and the assessment had to largely rely on a 'snapshot' impression.

Key objectives of the BA

The BA has attempted to evaluate local concerns and attitudes towards the ZF operation in
general and includes a discussion of the impacts of the project on the quality of life as perceived
by the served communities. LGU satisfaction with the SWM system is explored and the opinions
of a range of beneficiaries are highlighted.

Methodology

The methodology applied in the BA include (i) A review of background material, including the
review of previous social surveys; (ii) Meetings and interviews with ZF employees; (iii) Site
visits and meetings with LGUs and other beneficiaries. In order to obtain information from a
broad range of stakeholders three types of questionnaires were prepared and applied to (i) ZF
workers, (ii) LGUs (17 out of 82 served by the project) and (iii) individual citizens (106 persons,
both men and women).

Beneficiaries

Target at appraisal was about 200,000 people living in the Jenin district. However the project
ended up benefiting about 600,000 people.

Expected benefits

The project was implemented in an environment where key social issues included a marked lack
of trust, common purpose and public ownership of SWM. Cooperation between villages and

                                                                                                           37
municipalities was largely absent. The project would, if successful contribute to building social
capital in two areas: (i) Stakeholder cooperation: Improved cooperation involving local,
municipality and central stakeholders, and (ii) Changing attitudes: create increased trust in SWM
institutions, public awareness, ownership and willingness to pay (WTP).

More specifically, expected benefits included (iii) Improved SWM service, (iv) better public
health as a result of closure of unregulated dumpsites, (v) improved preservation of groundwater
quality, and (vi) a cleaner environment would benefit tourism. The last two expected benefits can
only be measured in a longer-term perspective

Summary of main findings

With regard to the points above, which observations/conclusions can be drawn at this point with
a reasonable degree of certainty? And based upon this information can any systematic findings
be presented with regard to e.g. affordability/reliability of service, reduction of disease, and
changes in property values?

Stakeholder cooperation: The BA maintains that the project has succeeded in establishing
increased trust and cooperation at the LGU level through regular interaction and the sharing of
ideas and experiences. This is not easily verifiable, but in view of the extremely difficult
environment in which the project was implemented, a significant degree of local cooperation
would likely be a prerequisite for the successful completion of the project.

Changing attitudes: Several awareness campaigns have been launched, and one specific result
has been the documented willingness to pay which indicates that beneficiaries believe SWM has
improved. According to the BA, there is a high commitment to paying the SW tariff which is
supported by 89% of those interviewed. Building ownership and changing attitudes to SWM is a
process which will take time, but the project seems at least to have made important steps in this
regard.

Closing of uncontrolled dumpsites; The closing is supported by 97% of the persons interviewed
and 71% maintained that the project has contributed to ending or reducing the open burning of
solid waste.

 Improved Solid Waste Management - The BA indicates that SW collection efficiency has
improved but basis for this observation is not spelt out. With regard to improvements in the
quality of service, the evidence presented in the BA is somewhat mixed. Roughly half of the
interviewed stakeholders indicated that the streets have become cleaner, while the other half is
equally divided between those who saw no change and those who thought it had become worse.
While this may suggest that work remains with respect to changing attitudes, the fact that there is
willingness to pay for the new service would seem to indicate that it is affordable and that
beneficiaries in general see an improvement of quality as a result of the project. 59% of LGUs
indicated that service coverage in their area did not change, 23% experienced an increase in
coverage and 11% a decrease.




                                                                                                  38
Better public health - An important aspect of SWM is the closing of uncontrolled dumpsites
which as indicated above has very broad public support, and the majority maintain that the
project has contributed to ending or reducing the open burning of SW. In addition 60% believe
that the health status of the community has improved as a result of the project and 62% maintain
that the SW collection has improved. No specific indicators have been presented in the BA, but
improvements are highly likely and can only be measured over a longer time period. In addition
to better public health and potential future reduction of pollution related diseases, the after-use of
closed dumpsites represents significant social benefits as previous unregulated sites are turned
into agricultural land, playgrounds and parks.

Several additional benefits were also emphasized in the BA:
Job creation: Employment created both during construction and operation is seen as an
important positive social impact. It should in particular be noted that all previous full-time waste
pickers who expressed interest have been able to obtain formal employment in the solid waste
sector.

Land values; Another potential benefit relates to increased land values, although available
information differs. According to the independent SWEMP assessment land values have doubled
or even tripled based on discussions with local residents, but this evidence is highly anecdotal.
The BA seems to indicate that land values had fallen closer to the landfill so without access to
more comprehensive information any conclusions would at this point be highly speculative.

Public awareness: Only 31% know about the project, largely residents in the ZF neighborhood.
There is a high commitment to paying the SW tariff which is supported by 89% of those
interviewed. 60% believe that the health status of the community has improved as a result of the
project and 62% maintain that the SW collection has improved. It is nevertheless stated that in
2002 62% of the sample indicated that they were satisfied with the level of SWM, while in 2009
this number was reduced to 60%. However, it is difficult to tell from the BA if the two samples
were directly comparable and how the questions had been presented, but additional efforts
should be made to increase public knowledge of the project.

Lessons learned

In the Beneficiary Assessment the key lessons learned are summarized as follows:

The extensive closure and rehabilitation of unregulated dumpsites is seen as a major
achievement. Informing the citizens and the LGUs of the project has supported the later
operation of the ZF landfill and has contributed to improved cooperation of the LGUs with ZF-
JSC. This can be counted among the other successes of ZF project.
BA recommendations include:
      Additional efforts should be implemented to improve the awareness of the public towards ZF
       project and SW management and ZF-JSC should extend their services to include other villages
       and LGUs to enhance the success of the project.
      The LGUs employees should be more involved in the awareness programs as to transfer the
       knowledge to their families, friends and others.
       The SW complaint system should be improved. This can be done by introducing a Complains
       Unit to document complaints and ensure necessary follow-up.

                                                                                                    39
      The employees and workers should be given more attention to let them feel that the success of ZF
       is theirs.
      ZF-JSC needs more vehicles, equipments and tools and should improve their inspection system

B) Relevant Findings from the Independent SWEMP Assessment (Assessment Report On
Economic and Technical Status and Technical Capability)

This brief assessment carried out in September/October 2009 differ in certain areas, but also
seems to confirm many of the social benefits highlighted in the BA. Some additional
perspectives are also emphasized. Relevant findings on collaboration at the local level as well as
social benefits are highlighted below:

Municipal commitment to JSC
Key points:
      The JSC waste service is held in high regard by municipal leaders

      No municipality of dominant size to control collective decision-making by the JSC Management
       Board

      Direct involvement each month by the PIU in Management Board meetings

      High public confidence in the reliability of waste collection and resistance to return to previous
       practices

      Fifty-six communities are now in the JSC with more seeking to join and, together with separate
       arrangements for more distant municipalities; the JSC now provides waste collection and/or
       disposal facilities for ~1 million inhabitants.

Strikingly, the PIU has been successful in overcoming initial skepticism from municipal leaders
and built up strong public confidence by maintaining reliable waste collection from residential
areas over the past two years. Municipal leaders in Jenin and Ya'bad commented that public
attitudes towards waste appear to have changed permanently and citizens probably would not
tolerate a return to unreliable waste collection or open dumping.

Social benefits
Key points:
      Improved waste services are now available to an estimated 1 million inhabitants of the northern
       part of the West Bank
      Thirty-nine uncontrolled dumpsites, some with multiple disposal locations, were rehabilitated and
       returned to natural (5), social (4) or productive (30) use

      Rehabilitated dumpsites used for new residential development                      or    combined
       residential/smallholding use have seen their land values double or even triple.

Improved waste service to residents
Previously municipal waste either went uncollected in many towns and villages or undertaken by
relatively unreliable systems. Waste accumulating closed to residential areas inevitably attracted
vermin and posed an obvious risk to public health from communicable diseases. Irregular open
burning of uncollected waste accumulations in residential areas was commonplace and at nearby

                                                                                                      40
open dumps contributes to poor local air quality and exacerbates respiratory disorders in
vulnerable residents
Quantifying social benefit from improved solid waste management is difficult. However, a value
of US$1/household/week (US$ 4/month) may be inferred by reflecting the willingness of most
residents to pay this sum for improved waste collection as an integral part of their electricity
tariffs.

After-use of closed dumpsites
The SWEMP has been successful in closing and rehabilitating fifty-four separate dumping
locations at 36 dumpsites. Five sites were visited during the assessment and all were free from
new waste accumulations. The most inventive use of land was children's playgrounds and parks
at four places and five others situated close to roads were left to return eventually to natural
ground. The overwhelming majority of locations (30) had been returned to agricultural use (15)
or undergoing redevelopment (or close to) new housing (15). The use of rehabilitated land as
parks or playgrounds (4 locations) provides a distinct social benefit from the general
improvement of community amenities.


C) Additional lessons learned which the team would like to highlight

   The role of Beneficiary Assessments

In spite of the constraints outlined in the BA discussed above, periodic assessments were carried
out (1999, 2003, and 2009) during the life of the project, an effort which indicates that the need
to involve stakeholders and strengthen local ownership was recognized by project management.
However, in designing these assessments more attention should be given to indicators which can
be monitored over time by creating a baseline prior to project implementation which subsequent
BAs can build on. This does not have to be a complex exercise, but should focus on a few key
variables (e.g. cost, perceived quality and coverage, reliability, willingness to pay etc). Other
issues are extremely difficult to quantify but should nevertheless be discussed, such as changed
attitudes to SWM, ownership, increased trust and cooperation.

   Social safeguard policies

OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement was not triggered in spite of the fact that about 50 waste
pickers were affected by the project. Ten of these were full-time waste pickers, and they were all
offered jobs in the formal SWM sector. Eight of these took advantage of this opportunity and
two indicated that they were not interested. With regard to land acquisition, it is emphasized in
the PAD that an earlier proposal to acquire the landfill site by expropriation was discontinued.
Purchase of land further north of the original site was then agreed with the owners, at a price not
less than prevailing market rates. The BA consultant also contacted several landowners who sold
their land as a result of the project, and the previous owners were reportedly satisfied with the
price.
Although potential safeguard issues related to loss of livelihood of waste pickers seem to have
been handled well given the circumstances, if we apply standards observed in 2009, OP 4.12
would have been triggered.

   Involving a social development specialist

                                                                                                 41
A review of project documentation indicates that social issues in general were given inadequate
attention by the Bank throughout implementation, and social development expertise did not
participate in most of the supervision missions. In projects of this nature involving a variety of
social issues a SD specialist should be a regular member of both preparation and supervision
teams. This would likely have facilitated a more systematic approach to both safeguards and
broader social development issues.

5.2     Beneficiary Assessment Finding on JSC and Stakeholder Cooperation
Source: Beneficiary Assessment of Zahret Al-Finjan Landfill Project, Section5.3, Universal Group for Engineering
and Consulting, Nablus, Palestine, October 2009.
Stakeholder Cooperation
ZF-JSC includes 20 LGUs that enhanced cooperation between the stakeholders at the
institutional level through together-work in a common effort to meet public interest.

Periodical meetings of ZF-JSC members at the level of Municipal or village mayors; 83 meetings
were held since the establishment of ZF-JSC on 24 July 2000. ZF-JSC adopted the majority rule
to make the decisions in secret and is committed in this system in all aspects of decision making.
For example the members participation in the abroad conferences was a hot issue at the table of
ZF-JSC at the beginning, since all of them wanted to participate in those conferences. ZF-JSC
came to the conclusion of voting on a suggestion of making the participation sequent to the
members and the priority based on the population size of the member's locality. As a result the
members become more comfortable with this decision. `Arraba as a nearby town to ZF landfill
requested 10% discount for the SWM services, but Jenin Municipality objected that. The JSC
solved the issue by making the majority rule; as a result all the members are committed and trust
the decision.

ZF-JSC is a unique experience in the West Bank in regard to the institutional cooperation and
coordination at the local governorate level. ZF-JSC includes permanently all the large LGUS and
periodically another three small LGUS of both Jenin and Tubas Governorates. They are
gathering periodically at the same table discussing not only their concerns, needs and problems
towards SWM their cities and villages, but also to the northern part of the West Bank.

Now, the LGUs have high level of cooperation and coordination than ever before, such
opportunity of being at the same table give them the chance to discuss wide range of issues more
than the SWM. Sharing ideas and experiences and common interests became true between these
parties. There are many examples of these successful and useful debated topics at ZF-JSC.
Commitment and trust from the members of ZF-JSC make them as one community; they discuss
problems even not related to SWM such as electricity, water supply, building codes and
construction activities. Sometimes they discuss conflicts between two families and possible ways
to solve them.

       Intensive Learning Implementation Completion and Results Report Workshop
                                   November 12, 2009
                              Best Eastern Hotel, Ramallah

1.     A World Bank Intensive Learning Implementation Completion and Results Report (IL-ICRR)
mission was mobilized to the West Bank during the period of November 11 - 13, 2009 for the Solid
Waste and Environmental Management Project (P054051). The mission was led by Mr. Ibrahim Dajani,
Senior Operations Officer and Task Team Leader, Mr. Kingsley Robotham, Principle Urban
Development Specialist and lead ICR Author (Consultant), and Ms. Fifi Antar, Program Assistant.

2.      During this mission, a Stakeholder Workshop to discuss the draft IL-ICRR was convened in
Ramallah. The Workshop was co-chaired by the Deputy Minister of Local Government, the Deputy
Governor of Jenin and the World Bank. Participants in the workshop represented a number of key
Palestinian Authority (PA) institutions including Ministries of Local Government and Planning, the Jenin
Governorate, and Jenin Joint Services Council. Participants also represented the Nongovernmental
Organizations and donors active in this sector, BIA consultants, as well as the private sector. A list of
Workshop participants are shown in Annex 1.

3.      The Workshop featured a number of keynote speakers and structured presentations by the Bank
task team, the co-financier European Commission, and the implementing agency (Jenin JSC). The
presentations, which were held in three sessions, triggered lively discussions about the three main
questions raised including: Were the Objectives Reasonable and Did the Project Achieve these
Objectives?; 2) Is this Operation Sustainable, Institutionally and Financially?; 3) What Lessons Can We
Learn From This Operation? and 4) Are the Proposed Performance Ratings Realistic?

4.      The first session featured keynote opening statements and presentations followed by question and
answer session. Speakers and participants praised the efforts of the World Bank, the Jenin JSC and other
partners and the great efforts in seeing the main output of this project, i.e. sanitary landfill in Zahrat Al-
Finjan, operational. Comments varied from a first of its kind large scale infrastructure in the West Bank to
the need to ensure that is operating in accordance with the national standards to the need for continued
public awareness. Participating Mayors from Jenin Governorate presented comparisons between the
quality of environment in their communities before and after implementing this project.

5.       The second session focused on addressing the project objectives and associated ratings. In
general, the participants were in agreement with the Project assessment and ratings. Specifically, there
was consensus about the realism and achievements of the project objectives in terms of implementing an
environmentally sound solid waste management system for Jenin District. This system has even extended
its services to neighboring governorates extending the number of beneficiaries from 200,000 to some
600,000. In addition to the construction of the sanitary landfill, the project also closed and rehabilitated
some 85 dumpsites contributing to significant improvement in the quality of environment. Moreover, and
while not directly financed by the project, the receipt of waste from neighboring governorates is also
contributing to the closure and rehabilitation of other uncontrolled and rehabilitation of several dumpsites.



                                                                                                           44
As for the ratings, there was consensus that the proposed "Highly Satisfactory" ratings for the PDOs and
Achievement per Component adequately reflect the project's accomplishments.

6.      The third session focused on the sustainability of this operation. In this respect, the participants
spoke highly of the sound institution established to oversee the management of waste in Jenin and Tubas
Governorates, exemplified by the Jenin Joint Services Council and its executive branch. There was also
consensus that this overall set up has become a prototype to be replicated in other governorates in the
West Bank. Financially, several participants, especially the participating mayors, were satisfied with the
benefits derived from the new SWM system and the significant improvement in the quality of
environment currently provided to their communities in comparison with the increased service costs. The
participants were also encouraged by the JSC's recent partnership with the private sector to establish a
waste recovery scheme towards recycling and composting of municipal waste received at the Zahrat Al-
Finjan landfill. This scheme, if successful, is expected to generate additional financial resources as well as
reduce the volume of waste to be land-filled extending the landfill's life by 5  7 years.

7.       The final session discussed lessons learned and performance ratings. The participants agreed that
the following lessons can contribute to the preparation and implementation of future operations in the
West Bank and in other regions where the Bank is active. The lessons are:
       Local ownership is more critical for project success than is often recognized;
       Individuals can make a major difference to project success; thus seeking out and strongly
        supporting capable local professionals is essential;
       Importance of effective public consultation and information sharing and effective
        communication channels;
       Early preparation and consensus building can pay significant dividends during project
        implementation;
       In conflict situations, it is advisable to seek out and build upon the common interests that
        often exist beneath the heat and rhetoric. This can sometimes open up unforeseen
        possibilities for cooperation;
       Significant tacit (local situational) knowledge often exists, and can sometimes be
        tapped/mobilized in support of the project;
       Consistent, thoughtful, and dedicated on-ground Bank supervision support can be the
        difference between success and failure.
8.       The participants have expressed concerns about the shortcomings of the monitoring of the landfill
operations. Despite the various monitoring measures adopted by the JSC at the landfill, still they believed
that external monitoring, led by the Environmental Quality Authority is key to ensuring that the landfill is
operating according to environmental standards established by the Palestinian Authority. Any deviation
from these standards will need to be reported and rectified. The participants also discussed the recent
experience related to complaints from communities surrounding the Zahrat Al-Finjan Landfill which
made it to the national media i.e. the odor in their communities which they believe due to poor landfill
management. The Bank's team leader reported on his recent meeting with the stakeholders in Zahrat Al-
Finjan and the agreed actions reached to address these complaints, including a) the need to establish
communication channels to allow for better exchange of views and feedback; and b) the establishment of
a fact-finding committee led by an NGO from Jenin to verify the causes of the odor and whether the
landfill is being managed in accordance with the operations manual.


                                                                                                           45
9.      On performance, the meeting agreed with the proposed overall "Satisfactory" rating for the Bank
and the Borrower and the specific "Highly Satisfactory" rating for the implementing agency. Though a
few, especially those who have been directly involved in the project implementation, expressed that
Bank's performance deserves a higher rating than that proposed by the consultant.

10.      Conclusion and Next Steps: The Bank mission expressed it sincere appreciation to all the
participants and their active contribution to the discussion and for their agreement to extend their
participation for one hour beyond the planned workshop program. The mission informed them that the
team will revise the report taking into consideration their comments and suggestions towards presenting it
for internal Bank review. Once this is concluded the final report is expect to be completed, published and
disseminated in hard copies and on the Bank's Website.

                         Executive Summary of the Project

The Palestinian Development Plan (PDP) for 1999-2003, presented at the Consultative Group
meeting in February 1999, identified investments in natural resource protection,
infrastructure rehabilitation and private sector development as priorities. In the solid waste
management field, the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC), as part
of its regional planning exercise, identified four sites, Jenin, Tulkarem district, Bethlehem
and Hebron for the possible location of regional landfills.

In 1998 at the present of the Palestinian Authority a feasibility study financed by the Bank
through a PHRD grant was undertaken with the objective of developing a solid waste
management strategy for the West Bank(since SWM issues were already being addressed in
Gaza) and develop priority interventions in the sector. The study identified integrated SWM
projects for Jenin and Hebron Districts.

The overall objective of the project will be to implement an environmentally solid waste
management system for Jenin District. This objective would be pursued through the following
activities: construction of a controlled sanitary landfill in Jenin district (ZF landfill);
rehabilitation/closure of uncontrolled dumpsites; improvement in solid waste management
(SWM) services in the district through the supply of equipment and the strengthening of
management and operation capacities, building institutional capacity in the newly created
Joint Services Council (JSC) for regional SWM services strengthening the institutional and
monitoring capacity of Environmental Quality Authority (EQA).

The Joint services council was established in the year 2000 by a decision from the Ministry
of local governments, the council consists of 15 municipalities and 5 village councils. The JSC
has its own mission and its own vision, and worked hard from the beginning to achieve the
objectives of the project (the construction of the sanitary landfill of Zahrat Al Finjan).

The JSC was able to achieve all the aims of the projects through several actions mentioned in
details in the report In 2002 , during the Israeli invasion to Jenin city , the Governorate was
completely closed, the military barriers prevented the movement of the citizens, the waste
containers were damaged by the Israeli tanks, thus the waste were accumulated everywhere.
Therefore, the council agreed with the World Bank to allocate the amount US$ 500,000 as an
emergency aid to the local communities participating in. the council faced many challenges
during the implementation of the project related to different reasons( local support, financial,
political) but due to their insistence to complete the project and with the support and the
guidance of the World bank , the council was able to construct the sanitary landfill and
improve the solid waste system in the whole governorate.



                                                                                              49
During the previous period the council rehabilitated and closed the random dumpsites which
were used by the various local governments, the closure and the rehabilitation process
were carried out according to the international engineering standards and procedures,
details about this issue are mentioned under the topic civil work. The council followed all
the required steps until the construction of the landfill was completed and the operation of
the sanitary landfill on 15/7/2007.

The construction of ZF landfill was completed in June 2007. The landfill works included
according to the determined design; Excavation & Embankment works, Lining works,
Leachate System, Rainfall drainage , Roads ,Civil works, Mechanical works, Electrical
works ,Fence and gate, you'll find more details about each item of these in the report.

The operation of the landfill includes several activities carried out daily and according to the international
standards in a way that protect the environment and the public health. The
Acceptable waste for ZF landfill is municipal solid waste, all Hazardous waste, infectious
waste, liquid waste and other waste not considered as municipal waste are not accepted at
ZF landfill, and there is poster at the gate of the site show the user the unacceptable waste.
The direction of the waste is the responsibility of the Forman at the waste cells, the
spreading and compaction of waste occur every day by using the suitable equipment, the
soil cover is spread uniformly every day while the leachate and the gas are well treated at
Zahrat Al Finjan according to the engineering standards.

The collection and transfer of solid waste are considered the base for solid waste
management since both processes need around 75% from the total cost. The solid waste
collection system in ZF landfill is controlled through identifying the waste quantity of the
different local communities, population and household number, and the distance to the
landfill. These data is recorded at the weighbridge room. The transfer stations are
important issue related to this subject and discussed in detail in this report.

According to the EIA study for the ZF landfill, the expected negative impacts have been
assessed and listed. The mitigation measures have been discussed taking into consideration
reducing the potential negative environmental impacts.

From the beginning of the project the council worked hard to strengthen the abilities of all
those related to the project, individuals and institutions through conducting conferences,
workshops and training courses. Since the project is considered one of the most successful
projects in the whole region, many visitors from different institutions came to visit the site
to benefit from this unique experience.

From the start of the project, the main objective of the council was to maintain the
sustainability of the project through improving the solid waste service within the whole
governorate, increasing the waste service fees and improving the fees collection rate of the
various local governments. The Financial management and the sustainability of the project
are mentioned in the financial part of the report in addition to the procurement, the
disbursement, performance evaluation and much more financial facts related to Zahrat Al
Finjan Sanitary landfill.

I.    INTRODUCTION
 The Palestinian National Authority gives considerable priority to the solid waste due to their
 potential negative impacts on natural resources and public health such as the groundwater. In
 1998 Ministry of Planning and International cooperation (MOPIC) prepared the Regional
 Development Plan and Solid Waste Strategy, this strategy identifies Jenin area as priority for
 developing solid waste management. In year 1999 the Palestinian Environment Quality
 Authority (EQA) issued the first Palestinian environmental law, which calls for preparing
 integrated solid waste management plan and in year 2000 EQA issued the Palestinian
 Environmental Strategy (PES). The PES identified implementation and construction of 3-5
 sanitary landfills in the West Bank. Jenin sanitary landfill (Zahrat El Finjan) was one of these
 sanitary landfill sites in the northern area of West Bank.

 In November 2000, the agreement for implementing the Solid Waste and Environmental
 Management Program (SWEMP) was signed between the World Bank and the ministry of
 finance for the benefit of Jenin Joint service council for solid waste management (JJSC) and the
 EQA. SWEMP project co-financed by the European Investment Bank (EIB) and coordinated
 through the Mediterranean Environmental Technical Assistance Program (METAP) aims at
 implementing an environmentally sound solid waste management system for Jenin District. This
 system aims at:
    1. Construction of a controlled sanitary landfill (Zahrat El- Finjan)
    2. Rehabilitation and closure of uncontrolled dump sites
    3. Improvement in solid waste management services in the district through the supply of
       equipment and the strengthening of management and operation capacities
    4. Building institutional capacity for JJSC.
      5. Strengthening the institutional and monitoring capacity of EQA.
 The first four objectives were implemented by JJSC, while the fifth objective was implemented by EQA. This report
 covers the EQA component only which counts for 500,000 US$ among which 100,000 U.S. dollars were deducted
 for emergency program.

 Most of the activities of EQA- SWEMP component were implemented before year 2006. Nevertheless,
 few activities were carried out through SWEMP project for period 2006-2009 due to the political situation
 in GAZA. It is worth to mention that the project was managed by EQA Gaza office, and only in May
 2008 transfer the account of SWEMP project from Gaza to Ramallah taken place.


II.   OBJECTIVES
 In the spirit of the main goal of EQA- SWEMP component "Strengthening the institutional and
 monitoring capacity of EQA", the following objectives seen to carry out this component:

      a. To Provide technical support for the JJSC Project Implementation Unit (PIU)
      b. To Prepare ToR's and to contract local NGO's for implementing public awareness programs and
         other consulting services. And to supervise and implement public awareness activities in Jenin-
         Tubas area.


                                                                                                               53
       c. To develop the capacity of EQA staff by Providing training programs in different topics such as
          financial management and accounting, computer science, management and others and to involve
          the EQA staff in environmental monitoring and inspection of solid waste management levels.
          Furthermore, to enhance the capacity of EQA by transferring the project staff members from
          project wise to permanent governmental employees.
       d. To monitor the process of the closure and rehabilitation of random dumping sites.
       e. To better understand and get experience in monitoring the construction and implementation of
          new development of sanitary landfill sites (Zahrat El Finjan)
       f. To cooperate with Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) to help EQA in carrying out ground water
          monitoring program.
 To fulfill those objectives and to be in the process from the early stages, EQA participated in most activities during
 the preparation, design and implementation stages either for EQA component and for JJSC component. Among
 these activities:

       9 Setting out the project objectives
       9 Revising and reviewing the appraisal document
       9 Reviewing and revising the fesibility studies and the Environmental and Social
         Assessment Studies.
       9 Reviewing the Trust Fund agreement
       9 Participate in negotiation sessions and workshops
       9 Preparing ToRs for carrying out consulting services and procurement.

III.   ACHIEVEMENTS
 Since the beginning of the project in early 2001 the project registered a lot of progress despite
 the difficulty of the situation in the West Bank and Gaza and the continuous closure and the
 siege imposed by the Israeli military forces since September 2000. Additionally the project faces
 many obstacles since the Palestinian elections in 2006 and the closure of EQA office in Gaza in
 2007. On the other hand during the implementation of the project, nearly most of the foreseen
 objectives either fully or partially achieved. The raising awareness and monitoring objectives
 were partially implemented. Nevertheless, new set of objectives agreed with the World Bank
 additionally implemented and achieved due to the political situation or due to new developments
 such as:

       9 To Coordinate and supervise the implementation of the emergency project, which is, developed
         for the benefit of some municipalities and village councils.
       9 To provide technical support to Wadi Shaeer Joint Service Council (WSJSC).

 Following are achievements of the project:

       Training and Capacity Building:

       9 Hiring 7 experts for different periods during the implementation of the project such as:

              o Project coordinator.
              o Public Awareness expert for the period October 1st ,2001  November 30,2005
              o In formation and data base expert for the periods September 1st, 2001  Feb 28,
                2002 and from June 1st 2001  July 31st 2003.
              o Financial accountant for the period November 1st 2001, - June 30, 2002.

                                                                                                                    54
        o Environmental Information Expert (GIS, GPS) for the period January 1st 2002
          December 31, 2003.
        o Environment monitoring consultant January 1, 2005- September 30,2005.

The above-mentioned staff were transferred from project wise to governmental employees
except the awareness expert, who had special obstacles that did not help EQA in searching for
getting him as a governmental employee.
 9 Through its training program, EQA intends to raise the capacity of its staff. Computer
     Group training course was taken place; fourteen (14) staff members get benefit from this
     training. The training course was 120 hours long and covered several subjects related to
     computer science and information technology including the use of different software (MS
     office, Outlook, Access, and others). At the end of the courses each participant was
     awarded a certificate from implementing agency (National Institute for Information
     Technology).
 9 A financial management-training course was to enhance the capacity of the financial
     managers and accountants. This course is carried out by the Arabic Center for
     Information Technology. The duration is 60 training hours three days a week. The staff
     members engaged in the training are the General Director for Financial and
     Administrative Directorate, Financial Director in Hebron office and one accountant.
 9 A training course about proposal writing and fund raising carried out by MAAN
     institution for 14 EQA staff members.
 9 A training course with about 200 hours held by Continuous Education Center (Birzeit
     University), for the benefit of the EQA high management staff in Gaza and West Bank.
     The course concentrate on strategic planning and financial management
9 To develop the staff capacity EQA in cooperation of General for consulting services held a
  training course of 10 staff members (6 from Gaza office & 4 from Ramallah office) on April
  2007. The components of the training course includes financial, and Administration management

Public Awareness:
EQA carry out several activities to raise the public awareness towards solid waste
management in the project area such as:
9 EQA in cooperation with JJSC contract Water and Environment Development
   Organization (WEDO), to carry out a public awareness program in Jenin governorate.
   The program consist of holding workshops and lectures, cleaning and forestation
   campaigns in all sites, PRA training courses 18 T.V and radio episodes, training 45
   teachers on child to child approach, disseminating brochures and stickers, designing
   public awareness campaigns in addition to preparing the solid waste management
   awareness strategy.
9 EQA recruit public awareness expert to coordinate the awareness program and to carry out other
  activities of awareness with schools and women associations
9 Some of the objectives can not be fully achieved and implemented due to political and managerial
  problems. Those objectives are the implementation of all awareness activities and the
  implementation of monitoring and enforcement. Only one complete awareness campaign carried
  out in cooperation with WEDO (Package 1) in addition to other awareness activities implemented
  by the awareness expert. While we can not implement package 2 (random dumping) awareness
  campaign.

Support to JJSC and WSJSC PIU's :

                                                                                               55
   9 EQA play as a backstop for the PIU as a technical advisor in all stages of the project in-
     term of helping in setting out the project objectives. Some of these activities are:
    o   The cooperation and coordination with JJSC began before from the early beginning of the project.
        EQA helped JJSC in preparing the bylaw of the JJSC. Besides that EQA managed the capacity
        building program for the JJSC. This program funded through PECDAR and executed by the
        Center for Engineering and Planning. The outputs of this program were 21(12 in English and 9 in
        Arabic) manuals and procedural guidelines for municipal solid waste management.
    o   revising and reviewing the appraisal document, r
    o   reviewing and revising the feasibility studies and the Environmental and Social Assessment
        Studies,
    o   Reviewing the Trust Fund agreement, Participate in negotiation sessions and workshops,
    o   reviewing ToRs for carrying out consulting services and procurement and revising and evaluating
        reports,
    o   Evaluating the tender document in cooperation with JJSC, assessment of random dumping,
        attending core stone meetings and workshops to support PIU,
    o   Contact and communicate village councils and municipalities to dispose their solid waste into
        Zahrat El Finjan by having a ministerial decision to accredit Zahrat El Finjan a regional landfill
        for the Northern area of West Bank.
    o   EQA advices JJSC in evaluating the tender documents, designs and construction of the land fill.
    o   EQA exchange knowledge with JJSC regarding the recycling of solid waste at Zahrat El Finjan
        Sanitary Landfill. Moreover, EQA gives JJSC a recommendation letter to go ahead with this
        project.

  9 In order to accelerate WSJSC, EOA Carried out feasibility study to help the council in determining
    the best solid waste management option either constructing sanitary landfill at the abandoned
    quarry or to rehabilitate Anabta dumpsite and convert it to transfer station and to use Zahrat El
    Finjan as a final disposal. EQA contracting engineer Nader El Khateeb to carry out this study,
    which recommend both technically and financially to go with converting Anabta Dumpsite to
    transfer station and to use Zahrat El Finjan as a final disposal. The study also gives a draft
    memorandum of understanding between JJSC and WSJSC.

Environmental Monitoring:
 9 The continuous Israeli closures of Jenin Governorate in 2005 hinder the process of monitoring the
     closure and rehabilitation of the dumpsites. Despite that, EQA conducted several visits to these sites
     in cooperation with the JJSC project implementation unit (PIU). These visits were conducted in
     different working stages such as transferring the solid waste from the randomly spread dump sites
     to the temporary dumps, implementing the leachate collection pond in Jenin dump site,
     rehabilitation of the dump sites. Environmental monitoring reports were prepared for some of these
     dumpsites. The visits were recorded to al Yamoun, Al Mahatta, Tubas, Silet Al Harthiya, Jaba,
     Qabatiya, Jenin and others. Several comments were discussed with the PIU staff and the work was
     done efficiently. In the early stages of the process EQA helped the PIU in determining the quality
     parameters to be tested in some dump sites and also helped them in searching for specializes
     laboratories in which PIU carried out several tests.
 9 More over EQA held several visits to Zahrat El Finjan site during construction and operation and
     discuss the some environmental concerns with JJSC.
 9 EQA prepare data base for environmental NGOs in the project area and collect data about soild
     waste management in the area.
 9 EQA prepared TOR for ground water monitoring expert in addition to preparing a memo of under
     studding with PWA on order to carry out water monitoring in Zahrat el finjan area, but due the
     political situation and some change as of world Bank staff, EQA carry out these activities.


                                                                                                        56
   9 On the other hand two TORS were prepared to hire two experts (CIM experts) for two year to help
     in purporting regulations for hazarders and domestic waste but unfortunately EQA cannot secure its
     portion of money to recruit these experts.
   9 EQA chairman (the minister) conduct a visit to Zahrat El Fijan in accompany of around 100 people
     from Ramallah governorate "mainly from Rammon village" to introduce to them the best practices
     sanitary landfills. This visit will help in convincing the public to accept the construction of
     Ramallah regional sanitary landfill.

 Emergency Component:
  9 Due to the severe conditions in West Bank and Gaza, EQA in cooperation of the World Bank
     mission decided to transfer US$100,000 (one hundred thousand US dollars) for the benefit of the
     Emergency Projects in the Palestinian rural areas in West Bank and Gaza. Ten municipalities and
     village councils, six in Gaza and four in West Bank get benefit from the project. The municipalities
     and village councils are Beit Lahia, Rafah, Beit Hanoun, Khuzaa, Abasan Al Kabirah, and Al
     Buriej municipalities in Gaza Strip. Tequa, Al Shiukh, Suorif municipality and Aboud village
     council in the West Bank. This project helps in providing trees for the damaged and uprooted areas
     in addition to building stonewalls to identify the damaged land parcels and other activities. The
     implementation of this component helps in contracting workers through the employment generation
     and conservation of environment. More than 5,000 working days in West Bank and Gaza were
     registered.
  9 To measure the effectiveness of the emergency project, EQA develop and distribute a questionnaire
     to the municipalities. The questionnaire shows the need of this type of interventions and it helps in
     future executing of similar projects.

IV. GAINED EXPERIENCE AND LESSON LEARNED
 EQA Participated in most activities during the preparation, design and implementation stages either for EQA
 component or for JJSC component. Among these activities:

     9 Setting out the project objectives
     9 Revising and reviewing the appraisal document
     9 Reviewing and revising the feasibility studies and the Environmental and Social
       Assessment Studies.
     9 Reviewing the Trust Fund agreement
     9 Participate in negotiation sessions and workshops
     9 Preparing ToRs for carrying out consulting services and procurement

 EQA better understand the Banks regulation in procurement and in consulting services and
 carefully used the Brown book (procurement) and the green book (Consulting services).
 Moreover it was a good chance to EQA to bennefit from the variety of expertise in the World
 Bank in different sectors such as: Environment, social financial, and lawyers. Additionally, it
 was a good opportunity to be involved in evaluating the tenders for design of Zahrat El Finjan
 sanitary landfill, closure and rehabilitation of random dumping sites, environmental and social
 assessment studies.

 The involvement of EQA in the preparation of the appraisal document and the trust fund
 agreement helps a lot in reviewing these documents for new projects such as the Southern Waste
 Management and Environmental Program and also WSJSC solid waste management Project.



                                                                                                         57
  Environmental and social impact study (ESIA) will be a basic format for Ramallah and Hebron
  sanitary landfills.

  The political situation in the period Sep 2000- 2004 affects the operation a lot and hinders the
  process of implementing the project in the assigned period. Also this situation hinders the
  cooperation between EQA offices in West Bank and Gaza.

  Implementing awareness campaigns activities was challenging for such project with very long
  period and during unrest times. Package 1 was carried out during the breaking of the second
  intifada, where the environment was luxury at that time of continuous closures and curfews.

  The Palestinian experience in implementing sanitary landfills was limited and this project gives
  us the opportunity to learn from the process even in unordinary situation. EQA learn about
  developing Environmental managements plans, get familiar to sanitary landfill components
  (Fence, gate, weighing bridge, compacting solid waste, covering solid waste, leachate collection
  and treatment, gas collection and monitoring,...), learned experience in rehabilitation and closure
  of open dumping, and ESIA studies.

  The project sets out a good base for institutional setup and arrangements between EQA, JJSC,
  ministry of local government, ministry of planning. One of the major outputs was the issuing of
  Joint service council bylaw.

  The visibility of EQA is highly seen by implementing the awareness campaigns and through
  implementing the emergency component as EQA work hand in hand with 10 municipalities and
  village councils in West Bank and Gaza.

V.     Evaluation of the Performance of the Bank
  For EQA SWEMP component it was only the World Bank and there is no Co financiers. Due to
  the prolongation period of the preparation and the implementation of the project several team
  leaders were involved in this operation which affect negatively the process of communication.
  Each team leader needs few months to understand the project and to follow up.

9,     SWEMP project and future similar projects
  This project laid down the basic principles in treating future similar projects. Several documents
  prepared during this project will help a lot in implementing other projects. Some of these
  documents are: Environmental and social assessment studies, feasibility studies, solid waste
  management awareness strategy, joint service council by law, PIU terms of reference. Also
  Zahrat El finjan plays core role as a success story in changing the Palestinian attitude against
  solid waste management, by convincing Palestinian people in other governorates to go a head
  for implementing sanitary landfills on regional level. Current projects get benefit from SWEMP
  are Southern waste and environment management project and Ramallah- El Bireh Solid waste
  management project and Wadi Shaeer solid waste management project.

VII.   Financial Audit Report
  The external financial auditor Talal Abu Ghazala upon request of EQA prepared he final audit
  report which covers the period January 1st, 2006 till June 30, 2009. It is worth to mention that


                                                                                                     58
 EQA sent to the World Bank application number 9 and EQA will refund the available amounts
 of money to the world bank through ministry of finance.(attached the audit report)

VIII. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
    The situation in the West Bank and Gaza since September 2000 was very tough and terrible.
    Siege and curfews were imposed on the Palestinian cities and villages hindering transportation
    even between very adjacent communities. This situation was clearly practiced in Jenin and
    Ramallah were most of our work takes place. For example Jenin dumpsite was already
    rehabilitated and the leachate collection pond was constructed, but due to the continuous
    Israeli invasions in Jenin city the Jenin dumpsite is still uncontrolled. Moreover in many days
    the wastewater treatment site was transformed to a dumping site. Moreover some activities of
    WEDO program were delayed due to requirements of the Ministry of Education as they as to
    postpone the Child-Child training to October 2003. Besides that, WEDO enforced to change
    part of the staff for some activities of the project due to the situation and special
    circumstances.
   There is a very good cooperation and coordination between EQA and JJSC through its PIU.
    Among this cooperation discussion about most project components takes place. This
    cooperation will be continued in future.
   It was a good chance to EQA to benefit from the implementation of this project, which
    formulate a backstop for other similar projects.

i
   The beginning is now dated at September 2000.
ii
    The crisis had an extremely negative impact on the entire Bank portfolio in WBG. The basic facts concerning the
crisis are summarized in the Palestinian Economy and the Intifada: "Four Years--Intifada, Crisis and Palestinian
Economic Crisis", World Bank, October 2004. The crisis resulted in strong pressures to utilize all potentially available
Bank funding (including funding from other on-going Bank projects) to help address create urgently needed
employment opportunities for the local population because of rapidly increasing unemployment and consequent
economic hardship. In response the Bank portfolio was comprehensively restructured in mid-2002 to free up funds for
emergency damage repair and employment creation.
iii
    Some of the flagship projects during this period included the Legal Development Project; the Palestinian NGO
Project; the Community Development Projects I and II; the Municipal Infrastructure Development Projects (MIDP) I
and II; the Health Systems Development Project; the Education Action Project; the Gaza Water and Sanitation Services
Project; the Southern Area Water and Sanitation Service Project; and the Electricity Sector Investment and
Management Project.
iv
    The Social Assessment section of the PAD outlined several other expected benefits, as follows: The project would
"...contribute to building social capital in respect of SWM in two major areas: Stakeholder cooperation: institutions
(villages, municipalities, the ministry, NGOs and the public) work together in a common effort in the public interest;
coordinated definition of respective responsibilities. Public knowledge, attitudes and practices: (i) increased trust in
project and in SWM institutions (ii) public awareness of the benefits of better integrated SWM and the real social,
aesthetic and health costs of the current "without project" system and practices; (iii) public sense of responsibility for
and ownership of environmental management and cleanliness; (iv) public willingness to pay; and behavior modification
in relation to SWM disposal, future recycling projects, etc." The latter were perceived to be necessary in a context of
widespread lack trust among organizations of state and their consequent unwillingness to work closely together for the
common good.
v
    Generally referred to hereafter as ZAF.
vi
    MEnA was later renamed Environmental Quality Authority (MQA). EQA is used hereafter in this document.
vii
     Letter from Country Director Nigel Roberts to Minister of Finance Salam Fayyad dated December 18, 2002.
viii
      The EU contribution is approximate because of exchange rate fluctuations. The actual disbursement was 3.6m
euros.
ix
    According to the files, most of the other changes arose out of the JSC/PIU's assessment of the realism of the initial
plan, or opportunities arising to improve the efficiency of the landfill design and/or operation. For example, it proved
impossible in the circumstances to pursue a design/build operation due to the lack of effective contractor response--the
latter stemming from the then ongoing military hostilities. Also, it seemed to have been more efficient for the PIU to
collect waste directly from many of the smaller municipalities and village councils than to wait for the latter to improve
the efficiency of their operations. According to the PIU, this was due to better overall SWM personnel and equipment
utilization by the JSC, and more predictable delivery of waste to the landfill.
x
    It was due to close in June 05 but did not close until June 09. One of the main reasons for the extensions after 2007
was the need to complete the Italian financed but Bank administered Anabta SWM project which was located adjacent
to but not in Jenin.
xi
    500 tons per day was considered by the visiting team experts to be the minimum.
xii
     The initial design by the international landfill consultant (Hydroplan of Germany) contracted under the project was
too costly; used more land than was necessary; required the closure of the existing access road; interrupted a historic
railway track; and required the construction of culverts under the land fill as well as the construction of 2 dams. The
Israeli Consultant was hired as a sub-consultant by Hydroplan, and helped with construction supervision as well as
redesign.
xiii
      The opportunity to include the large Nablus municipality seems to have arisen out the fact that the latter was often
under siege from the Israeli military for extended periods (in fact most of the time) and was thus having difficulty
transporting its waste to an Israeli controlled landfill some 45 km away in the Jordan Valley (compared to Al-Finjan's
23 km). The exact date of the Nablus decision is unknown but it was well before the opening of the landfill in July 07.
Nablus was one of the first to deliver waste to the new landfill.
xiv
     The January 2004 mid-term review observed that the expected landfill waste intake was well below that necessary to
achieve economies of scale--in fact half of what was desirable.
xv
     The JCS did raise tariffs in stages over the period, from about NIS 4/hh/month up to about NIS 16/hh/month.




                                                                                                                      67
xvi
     Despite the importance of the third factor, it is the synergistic effect of the positive factors that is perhaps unusual.
xvii
      Nor is it clear that the data collected were ever seriously reviewed by the Bank supervision team.
xviii
       The data used in this ICR were for the most part independently verified by consultants and an independent
beneficiary survey.
xix
      Information reaching other municipalities, ministries and donors (often via Bank-supervision staff) that something
important was happening in Jenin with respect to SWM. This made the Jenin landfill a must visit for observation of best
practice in WBG, and a must stop for visiting Bank senior officials. It is this latter realization of significant change in
Jenin that probably began to help change the culture--and not just on SWM and not just in Jenin, but also on the wider
national possibilities for inter-municipal cooperation in service delivery. This in turn informed and smoothed the way
for the preparation of recently approved Bank-supported Southern West Bank Solid Waste Management Project
(SWMP, FY-09). The latter is essentially a replication of SWEMP, drawing on the same concept and several of the
SWEMP consultants.
xx
    The documents report various numbers. According to the PIU completion report 54 sites were closed in 39 areas.
However, several of the sites consisted of multiple locations, giving rise to 85 number reported here.
xxi
     Whilst the assumptions were similar to the PAD, some differences were inevitable, in particular the tight control
exerted over costs and a larger than expected number of municipalities paying for waste to go to the new landfill.
xxii
       Participants indicated that citizens in Jenin blocked the road on a recent occasion when an unreconstructed LGU
tried to establish a new uncontrolled dump site. Also, the beneficiary assessment provided evidence that citizens and
LGUs now viewed a return to uncontrolled dumping as an anathema.
xxiii
        The beneficiary assessment provided evidence that the Jenin JSC is being used as a venue to discuss and address
other municipal service delivery issues (see Note at Annex 5.2), and that several other municipalities are queuing up to
join the "club". Also, information on the project files indicates a very positive impact on local governance and
institutional cooperation generally in WBG--evidenced partly by the progress in developing the new Hebron SWM
project.

xxiv
      This is based on recent discussion with these authorities on SWMP.
xxv
     As indicated above, EQA was also an implementing agency.
xxvi
      The landfill partly sits on lands leased from the government, and MOF was highly instrumental in facilitating this
lease.
xxvii
       EQA's performance was hampered by the fact that the head office and the Minister were based in Gaza and were
thus isolated from the main stream of activities in the West Bank. This problem was made even more acute by the onset
of the Intifada in late 2000. However, there seems to be some additional explanatory factors, including: weak
leadership and a lack of sufficient managerial and technical focus.
xxviii
       They promoted dialogue among technical specialists on both sides of the divide both before and during project
implementation (including hosting small group workshops of technical experts from both sides outside of Israel);
choose a site that had been already approved for sanitary landfill construction by Israeli military authorities and thus
not open to challenge from outside; encouraged Palestinian specialists and authorities visit Israel and to learn from and
build on the Israeli experience.
xxix
       It is perhaps unusual to personalize an issue in these reports but it is probably justified in this case. Hani personally
undertook much of the analysis himself and led most of the initiatives--supported of course by the JSC.
xxx
     To be accurate and perhaps for obvious reasons, the Israeli consultant was not hired directly but through the foreign
consultant.
