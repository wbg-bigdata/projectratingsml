Working Report                           i                                AMCO RAP
I       EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.1     Overview
The resettlement of the AMCO community in Kitwe, Zambia, is to take place as part of the
Copperbelt Environmental Project (CEP), which aims to address the environmental and social
legacy of mining in the Copperbelt conducted during the years of state-owned enterprise under
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) Limited, in light of current privatisation efforts. In
this instance, houses occupied by the AMCO community are cracking as a result of surface
subsidence caused by mining and are to be relocated.
The objectives of the study are to undertake a detailed analysis of the social and economic activities
of AMCO residents and develop a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) to ensure that residents are
resettled in a timely and efficient manner.
Planning for the resettlement of the community is being conducted according to the requirements of
the Copperbelt Environmental Project, the appropriate laws and regulation of the Republic of
Zambia as well as the applicable World Bank guidelines. Responsibility for the resettlement vests
with ZCCM-Investment Holdings, the company formed after the privatisation of its predecessor,
ZCCM.
1.2     Historical Background
AMCO is located adjacent to a residential area, Mindolo, on the northwestem periphery of the city
of Kitwe some 500m north of the Mindolo Stream. AMCO is approximately 5 km from the centre
of Kitwe. The settlement falls within the Mindolo Ward and is under the administrative control of
the Kitwe City Council.
The houses were originally built for contract labour by AMCO in the 1960's, a contractor to ZCCM
Ltd., on land now owned by Mopani Copper Mines (MCM). Mpelembe Drilling then used these
buildings in the 1980's. Many of the houses are still occupied by the original labourers, or their
families and descendants, who have assumed "ownership" status. Others have been sold, or given,
to new residents by the original labourers, many of whom have now been residing in this location
for an average of 12 years. The sale and purchase of these houses, whilst done in exchange for
money, was never concluded with an exchange of title or registration with the council. Tenants
have mostly been resident in their homes for a shorter period, commonly less than 4 years, although
one has been renting since 1982.
Cracking of a few houses has resulted in some AMCO residents being provided with temporary
accommodation by ZCCM-IH until such time as the construction of the new settlement is complete.
1.3.,   Resettlement Principles
1ZCCM-IH recognises the fact that involuntary displacement of households from the caving area
could, if not carefully managed, result in socio-economic hardships for the affected persons.

Working Report                          ii                               AMCO RAP
However, given that the residents' lives are in danger as a result of subsidence, their relocation is
viewed to be in their best interests, with which they concur. A number of principles have been
detailed in the report that would underpin the resettlement planning and implementation process.
1.4     Planning
The compilation of the RAP was preceded by a considerable amount of preparatory work
undertaken by ZCCM-IH, both in initiating a consultation process with the affected community,
and in gathering information on the community via a census conducted by Citizens for a Better
Environment. Additional work by the Government Valuation Department also recorded valuable
information concerning the community in their valuation report.
A Steering Committee was formed early in 2003 to represent the community in consultations with
ZCCM-IH and other stakeholders. The RAP process focussed on corroborating the information
gathered previously, adding to the level of detail the necessary for the compilation of the plan and
consulting with a wider range of key stakeholders to gather views, obtain support and conceptualise
the resettlement process.
1.5     Profile of affected community
An overview of the national, regional and local populations has been included in the report to
provide comparison with the AMCO and host community. Overall, the community is poor by
comparison with limited skills and employment opportunities.
AMCO is comprised of 89 households, 583 persons, occupying 78 homes (actually very small
apartments), which are affected by surface subsidence. 52 households were noted to "own" their
homes, while 37 families reported that they were tenants. Three of these families reside with the
"owners" of their respective houses, to whom they pay rent, while 8 units are occupied by 2
families each (16 families). Rent is paid to 29 "owners" either living in AMCO (5 cases) or
elsewhere.
The AMCO community is characterised by a very youthful population, with 46% of the population
under the age of 15 and only 4% over 55 years of age. Such a young demographic has important
implications for dependency patterns.
55% of the total population is female with 51% of those older than 19 married. 64% of household
heads are male.
Only 18% of the economically active population are formally employed, 40% being "self-
employed" and the remainder unemployed. Formal employment is significantly higher among men
who comprise 79% of those formally employed with women mainly being self-employed.
In terms of economic activity, 85% cited agriculture as the main activity followed by informal trade
at 25% (e.g. charcoal and grocery retailing), small business (22%) and mining (19%). Average

Working Report                         iii                              AMCO RAP
household income of the AMCO community is about K280 000 per month. Agricultural activities
are geared to food production with vegetables, maize and groundnuts being the main crops. The
only livestock are ducks and chickens. Banana and mango are the main fruit trees owned by
residents. Limited agricultural production inputs are purchased with cultivation being only by hand.
22% indicated that they irrigate their crops, mostly from the Mindola stream. Natural resources
used include charcoal, grasses/reeds for construction and some fishing.
43 residents identified fields close to the village, which averaged 3 105m2 with a median of
1 762m2 . Total land sizes (including all fields) ranged from 14 676m2 (1,47 ha) to 34m2. In addition
to the fields close to the village, many residents noted other fields used by them located some "two
hours" walk away. Many members were reluctant to disclose details, as utilisation of these fields
would not be affected by the move.
Education levels are low, which is partly a reflection of the young population, with 16% with no
formal education, 18% having completed Grade 7 and only 26% having completed Grade 8 or
higher (5% completed Grade 12). The majority (66%) of scholars, representing 35% of the
population, are in primary school (Grades 1 - 7). Children attend a wide range of schools in the
area with the majority attending Mindolo Upper Basic School, some 2 km to the east. Many
children do not attend school.
Religion plays an important role in the lives of AMCO residents with a range of churches attended,
which is also a reflection of the range of languages spoken. ChiBemeba is predominantly the home
language of most residents but 6 other languages are also spoken.
House ownership, rental and general occupancy is complicated, which needs to be taken into
account for compensation arrangements - especially when the central thrust of the resettlement is to
afford people improved opportunities and circumstances at their new place of residence. Housing in
AMCO is largely in the formn of contiguous houses ranging in size from 31 to 17 mi2. There are
other larger freestanding structures including a tavern. Many residents have constructed additional
structures, which abut the houses. Typically, these include showers/washrooms, cabins, latrines and
verandas.
There is a single operational water standpipe in AMCO with households using an average of 1001
per day. Few residents are aware of who is responsible for maintenance of the supply. The other
source of water is the Mindolo Stream. The majority of respondents indicated that they would be
willing to pay if piped water were to be provided, but at nominal rates (KS 000 pm).
The primary sources of energy used is charcoal for cooking and heating and candles for lighting
(none recorded electricity) However, the majority of respondents indicated that they would be
willing to pay for electricity, at an average of K15 000 pm. By comparison, the majority of
residents were less willing to pay for solid waste disposal.
The most common illness noted by AMCO respondents is malaria, followed by respiratory tract
infections, sexually transmitted infections including HIV / AIDS, diarrhoea and tuberculosis. A

total of 60 (10%) household members were noted to have been ill during the month of July 2003.
Residents mainly utilise the nearby Mindolo Clinic for health services.
There are no communal, religious or recreational facilities other than the office of the Movement
for Multiparty Democracy (MMD). The nearest football field is located next to the Mindolo Clinic.
1.6     Profile of host community
The proposed relocation site is located in a vacant area close to the existing settlement, in Mindolo,
between the Mindolo clinic and Mindolo Upper Basic School. The Mindolo Ward has a population
of 16 025 people (2000) comprising of 2 329 households. A sample survey of households indicated
a young population as per the AMCO village with 29% adult males, 28% adult females, and 43%
children under the age of 18. Similarly, 32% are formally employed (mainly work in the mining
sector), a further 28% either informally or self-employed, with 40% unemployed. These high levels
of unemployment can be expected to lead to friction with AMCO residents for local jobs.
Average income levels are much higher than AMCO at K600 000 pm. This differential may explain
negative perceptions of sectors of the host community towards AMCO residents regarding such
matters such as general living standards, levels of hygiene and cleanliness, social practices, as well
as potential criminal activity. Should the AMCO residents be settled in conditions potentially
superior to their own then this could also lead to conflict.
1.7     Extent And Impact Of Resettlement
The potential impacts resettlement will have on the residents of AMCO can be summarised as
follows:
*  Displacement of a total of 89 households, comprised of 583 persons
*  Certain of these can be considered vulnerable households, including female-headed
households, those relying on extemal remittances, as well as young children, orphans, the
elderly and disabled persons. A total of 189 persons fall within these latter categories.
*  Loss of existing croplands and fruit trees (within caving area),
*  Loss of certain economic activities and social facilities, such as the tavem, communal
areas, trading stalls, etc.
*  Effect on public safety and security, felt mainly by the host community
*  Positive impacts include better access to markets, proximity to social services (schools,
clinics, churches, police and transport services)

Working Report                          V                               AMCO RAP
1.8     Views on community resettlement
The conceptualisation and planning of this RAP are based on a wide range of consultations that
have taken place with key stakeholders. The consultation process was initiated by ZCCM in
December 2002 with a number of interactions subsequently occurring. Numerous interactions then
took place between the AMCO community and the RAP planning team in August 2003. The host
community was engaged on two separate occasions by the RAP team. Views on resettlement were
obtained from the AMCO residents, the host community as well as the following government
organisations:
* Kitwe City Council; Local councillor; Mindolo Clinic; Mindolo Upper Basic School;
Deputy District Administrator; and District Agricultural Coordinator
In additions consultations were also held with the following NGO's to obtain their views and where
they could assist the resettlement process:
* CETZAM; Citizens for a Better Environment; Mindolo Ecumenical Foundation; Oxfam;
YWCA
Finally consultation was held with the Mopani Copper Mines and the Asset Holding Company -
MMS. A Key Stakeholders meeting was then held where all views were outlined and workshopped.
1.9     Resettlement Implementation
Site selection
Two alternative sites for resettlement were presented to the AMCO community. The first, at
Kawama Farm, was rejected because of its distance from the social, commercial and agricultural
resources, services and facilities AMCO utilise. The AMCO community decided on a site for
resettlement immediately adjacent to, and east of, the Mindolo Township. The topography, soils
and climate on the resettlement sites are very similar to those of the AMCO site. Both sites have
been heavily urbanised and degraded.
Since the proposed land for resettlement belongs to ZCCM-IH, there is no need to apply for
authorisation for the settlement. However, finality on zoning is required. The portion of land used
for settlement would then be excised from the existing portion of ZCCM-IH's land and a new
subdivision created. This subdivision would then be handed over to the Kitwe City Council, which
would then issue individual leasehold (99-year) title to the members of the AMCO community.
Since the area is to be used for residential use, there cannot be any large-scale agricultural activity,
other than small-scale home-based cultivation. Mopani Copper Mines has undertaken to allocate
larger fields on land some 5 km from the site. This land will not vest with the AMCO community,
but will be theirs to use under a written agreement with Mopani.

Valuation of assets
Following the initial population census conducted on 26 and 27 December 2002, a valuation of the
community's assets was undertaken by the Government of Zambia's Valuation Department. The
valuation covered the following assets:
a)     Houses, latrines, showers, stores, shops and ancillary structures,
b)     Fruit trees,
c)     Backyard gardens and land used for agricultural purposes within the caving area.
The community has not signed off on the findings of the survey.
1.10    Eligibility & compensation
The types of house occupation that exist in AMCO are as follows:
1. Owners" residing in AMCO, not renting any property to others;
2. Owners residing in AMCO and renting out space inside their homes, which they share with
the tenants;
3. Owners residing in AMCO and renting out other houses in the settlement;
4. Owners residing elsewhere, renting out houses in AMCO;
5. Tenants living in separate structures;
6. Tenants sharing with other tenants; and
7. Tenants sharing with owners.
Different compensation entitlements apply to each of the above categories. Compensation has been
divided into following categories:
1. Compensation for structures lost, as determined by the Government Valuation Survey;
2. Compensation for additional structures such as vegetable stands, latrines, shelters other
assets including fruit trees and crops lost, also noted in the survey;
3. Disturbance allowance (20% of the value of structures indicated above) based on the
recommendations of the Government Valuation Department
4. House at resettlement site (including title deeds signifying official ownership) - standard
size, based on replacement size of structures lost plus I Om2;
5. House at resettlement site of minimum size (30m2) for tenants;
6. Transport of household and moveable assets to new site; and
7. Compensation for lost rental income.

1.14    Monitoring and evaluation
Monitoring is an essential component of the resettlement process designed to ensure that targets are
achieved and standards maintained. An independent monitoring agent must be appointed by ZCCM-
IH, who has past experience in monitoring of similar projects and be familiar with the particular
context. Initially, monitoring should be conducted every quarter beginning January 2004. After the
first year of monitoring, visits should be conducted every six months for at least twenty-four months
thereafter. The monitoring requirements are listed in the report.
1.15    Livelihoods Restoration Plan
Of crucial importance for the AMCO community is their ability to sustain themselves in their new
settlement. Therefore, the livelihoods restoration plan is a vital component of resettlement planning
and ultimately decides the fate of the affected community. On the positive side, the AMCO
community will be relocating to a proximal site and hence will not be removed from places of work,
schooling or health services. In fact, they will be closer to these facilities than before. However there
will be negative impacts, the most conspicuous of these being the loss of their food gardens and other

fields as a result of the move. One must not underestimate the stress caused by resettlement and the
ability of these emotional aspects to adversely affect people's livelihoods.
The livelihoods restoration plan consists of seven components:
*  Agriculture;
*   Institutional capacity building;
*  Health, hygiene & family;
*   Financial skills;
*  Enterprise training;
*  Recreational facility; and
*  Community participation in the resettlement.
ZCCM-IH will appoint an independent agent to finalise the planning and implement the livelihood
restoration plan. This agent should be an individual or organisation with a depth of experience in
sustainable development projects and experience with poorer communities. Responsibility for the
livelihoods restoration plan will fall on ZCCM-IH. It will be responsible for the initial cost of project
planning and implementation and monitoring for two years after resettlement. Thereafter,
responsibility for the community vests with the Kitwe City Council and other authorities involved.
The implementation of the livelihood restoration plan should commence as soon after the RAP has
been approved.
An indicative budget for the livelihoods restoration plan is provided in the Table E4. The figures will
require confirmation prior to implementation of the plan.

process.
1.16    Conclusion
According to process, the RAP is to be presented to all parties involved to establish that all issues
have been incorporated and appropriately addressed. Once the draft report has been approved by
ZCCM, it is to be distributed to all Key Stakeholders and presented to a public workshop in late
September, after which it will be finalised.

2       INTRODUCTION
The resettlement of the AMCO community in Kitwe, Zambia is to take place as part of the Copperbelt
Environmental Project (CEP), which aims in part to address the environmental and social legacy of
mining in the Copperbelt conducted during the years of state-owned enterprise under Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) Limited, in light of current privatisation efforts. In this instance,
houses occupied by the AMCO community are cracking as a result of surface subsidence caused by
mining. The houses were originally built for contract labour by AMCO, a contractor to ZCCM Ltd.,
on land now owned by Mopani Copper Mines (MCM). Many of the houses are still occupied by the
original labourers, or their families and descendants, who have assumed ownership status. Others
have been sold, or given, to new residents by the original labourers, many of whom have now been
residing in this location for approximately 10 years.

2.1     Background to the Copperbelt Environmental Project
The mining of copper and minor minerals such as cobalt, lead and zinc, has been the backbone of
Zambia's economy for over 80 years. While these mining activities have provided infrastructure
development and have accounted for the bulk of Zambia's foreign earnings, they have resulted in
many negative and sometimes harmful environmental consequences. These impacts have accumulated
over time.
ZCCM-IH, the holding company created out of ZCCM, retained liability for a wide range of
environmental concerns, which were not passed on to private investor consortia. ZCCM-IH is
charged with, among other tasks, managing the remediation of the defunct mine sites and lands, as
well as implementing and/or financing the obligations agreed to with investors as part of specific
privatisation deals, such as decommissioning of defunct sites within newly defined Mine License
Areas.
The CEP is being implemented in both the Copperbelt (see Map 2 for location) and Kabwe, to address
environmental liabilities associated with the mining sector, following the privatisation of the mining
assets. The principal objectives of the plan are to:
*  Protect the public health and safety;
*  Reduce or prevent environmental degradation; and
* Allow a productive re-use of the land either to its pre-mining use or an acceptable alternative,
where applicable.

2.3     Historical Background
The AMCO settlement has been in existence since the 1960s when it was used as housing for mine
labourers. The majority of current residents have lived in the settlement since the early 1990s when
they either bought or were given houses by former mine employees resident in the village. These
transactions were never legally registered, and, in fact, were illegal in that the mine employees never
owned them in the first place. A number of current residents are renting their homes from others who
have lived in the houses they have become de facto "owners" of since 1966 (for example, Mr. Iloni
Simpamba in house A14 who is the oldest man in the village, aged 77). Tenants have mostly been
resident in their current homes for a shorter period, commonly less than 10 years, although one (Mr
Chipulu Mungole in house Gl) has been renting the house he lives in since 1982 from Mr. Augustine
Mwaba, who owns a number of properties in the settlement. It is however important to note that actual
'ownership' status is somewhat intangible, since the only actual title for the houses in question still
belongs to ZCCM-IH.
2.4     Current Economic Context
The predominant economic activity in the area is mining of copper. While Kitwe is the most
economically diversified city in the Copperbelt, it is still heavily dependant on the mining and
processing of copper and cobalt. Copper prices have been in continuous decline since the highs
reached shortly after independence in the 1960s (see Figure 1). This has resulted in a loss of
profitability and retrenchments in the mines and related industries. Poverty has deepened and more
people have been forced into the informal economy to survive.

The socio-economic problems at AMCO are symptomatic of other urban areas in the Copperbelt. The
establishment of large-scale mining and metallurgical facilities in the 1930s resulted in a substantial
and sustained influx of job seekers. These people migrated to the Copperbelt, a region that had
previously been thinly populated. In 1969, 91% of the Copperbelt's population lived in urban centres
(Hywel Davies, 1971). Eighteen percent of all Zambians lived in the Copperbelt at this time, which
had five of the country's six largest towns. In this province the location of each of the principal urban
centres (excluding Ndola) was dictated by the location of the ore deposits. By the 1990s, more than
one million people resided in the Copperbelt.
The decline of the copper industry has had serious social and economic consequences. Increasing
numbers of people have been retrenched from the copper mines and the industries, which support
them. This has lead to high rates of unemployment. The inability of many residents of Copperbelt
towns to pay for services has decreased the viability of local authorities. Increasing numbers of people
are engaging in informal agricultural activities as a survival strategy. Large tracts of ZCCM-IH land,
formerly set-aside for mining purposes, has been targeted by local authorities for settlement and
cultivation.

2.5     Need for Resettlement
AMCO is located on mine land adjacent to a residential area on the north-western periphery of the
city of Kitwe. A prominent fracture, that can be seen in old surface subsidence plans, cuts across the
AMCO housing area. This fracture is shown in the plan attached to the "Report on Stability Concerns
of AMCO houses located in the Mindola caving area." (Mopani Copper Mines, 2002. See Annex 3),
and has raised concerns about the safety of the residents living in the area. A surveillance survey was
conducted in November 2002 to investigate the extent of surface fractures and cracks. The
surveillance team determined that fractures pass through some gardens and some of the AMCO
houses. A decision was therefore taken to demolish all existing buildings in the area, and to resettle
residents.
2.6     Statement of Principles
ZCCM-IH recognises the fact that involuntary displacement of households from the caving area
could, if not carefully managed, result in socio-economic hardships for the affected persons. The
following principles were adopted to underpin the resettlement planning and implementation process:
* Resettlement will be planned and carried out in accordance with the laws of Zambia, the
CEP Environment and Resettlement Framework, the guidelines of World Bank
Operational Policies and Bank Procedures, 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement), as outlined in
Annex 1, and the Resettlement Plan. Where full adherence to these laws and guidelines is
not possible (e.g. if these laws and guidelines clash), plans and motivations for deviation
will be prepared by ZCCM-IH and submitted to the relevant authorities for approval.
* The resettlement process will be transparent and conducted with the active participation
of the affected households and communities.
* Affected households have been notified of the need to relocate, and a representative
community structure has been formed to facilitate communication between ZCCM-IH and
the communities. This structure will be capacitated to participate in the resettlement
planning, implementation, and monitoring processes.
* The importance of minimising the disruption of natural resource utilisation and seasonal
crop cycles will be factored into the planning process, as will other sources of livelihoods.
*  The affected communities will be relocated to a township, which is to be established on a
site selected by the communities. Provision will be made for full compensation of losses,
as well as provision for municipal services at the relocation site.
* In accordance with the objectives of World Bank OP 4.12, "resettlement activities (will
be) conceived and executed as (a) sustainable development program, providing sufficient
investment resources to enable persons displaced by the project to share in project
benefits. Displaced persons (will) be meaningfully consulted and (will) have opportunities

to participate in planning and implementing (the) resettlement program." Furthermore,
"Displaced persons (will) be assisted in their efforts to improve their livelihoods and
standards of living or at least to restore them, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels."
* Affected households will be assisted to relocate, i.e. to physically move possessions to
their new homes.
* Affected households will also be assisted to re-establish their economic base.
* The resettlement process will be subjected to a regular process of independent monitoring
and review.
Against the background of these principles, the following actions have already occurred:
* Affected households have been notified of the need to relocate, and a representative
community structure has been formed to facilitate communication between ZCCM-IH and
the communities. This structure will be empowered to participate in the resettlement
planning, implementation, and monitoring processes.
* It has been agreed with the AMCO community that they will be relocated to the Mindolo
Township, to a site selected by the community. Provision will be made for full
compensation of losses, as well as provision for municipal services at the relocation site.
* This RAP has been commissioned to integrated all previous and ongoing actions, and will
be approved by the appropriate authorities prior to implementation.
2.7     Approach and Methodology
2.7.1   Introduction
The compilation of the RAP was preceded by a considerable amount of preparatory work that was
undertaken by ZCCM-IH, both in initiating a consultation process with the affected community, and
in gathering information on the community. In the sphere of consultation, a Steering Committee
representing the community was formed early in 2003. Information gathered has included socio-
economic data by means of a census survey, as well as an official valuation of assets conducted by the
Govemment Valuation Department. Records of meetings held prior to the RAP process commencing
in August 2002, including findings of the original census, are included as Annex 10, while findings of
the Government Evaluation Report are included as Annex 4. The task of the RAP consultants was to
integrate this existing information and build on it through the various activities outlined below. This
was used to compile a RAP in accordance with the principles described in Section 2.6.
2.7.2   Objectives
The specific objectives of the work conducted as part of compiling the RAP were to

*  Provide a detailed analysis of the social and economic activities of AMCO residents who will
need to be resettled as a result of mining activities causing houses to crack and associated dangers
of subsidence.
*  Develop a RAP, which will ensure that the AMCO residents are resettled in a timely and efficient
manner, without disrupting their social and economic livelihoods.
2.7.3   Methodology
In order to satisfy the requirements of the ZCCM-IH terms of reference (ToR), and the residents of
AMCO, the following broad process was adopted to conduct a situation analysis and compile the
RAP:
*  Stakeholder consultation;
*  Data collection;
*  Geo-spatial analysis and mapping; and,
*  Resettlement budgeting.
These steps are described in detail in the sections that follow.
Consultation
Virtually the entire RAP planning process comprised one form of consultation or another. A summary
of meetings held is provided in Table 1 below. Views solicited are captured in Section 6. Records of
meetings are attached in Annex 11.

The aims of the consultation process were:
*  To determine the basis for compensation in terms of household possessions;
* To continue the dialogue between ZCCM-IH, its consultants and the community;
* To provide a platform for discussion and resolution of resettlement issues and processes;
* To maintain transparency; and,
* To build trust.
All meetings with stakeholders were documented and a record was kept of comments, questions and
attendance. Responses to queries were provided as far as possible, with outstanding queries still
awaiting final response documented.
Consultation with AMCO community
Meetings with the community were pursuant to consultations already held between ZCCM-IH and the
AMCO community. The community had already consented to relocate, hence the thrust of the RAP
consultations was to inform the community of the purpose of the surveys and valuations, to explain to
them their rights as co-planners of the resettlement process and to begin the resettlement process in
earnest.
Consultation with host community
The incorporation of the host community into the resettlement planning process is critical in the event
of resettlement of the AMCO community into a currently inhabited area. One of the potential
resettlement sites identified by the AMCO community in the nearby Mindolo Township will have an
impact on the host community. This community resides in houses and flats purchased from ZCCM as
part of the privatisation process. The consultants included this community in the consultation process
giving special attention to the possible differences in income levels between the settlers and the host
community.
While a final decision on a relocation site for the AMCO residents has not been made, the community
has made a preliminary selection of one of three sites offered to them in Mindolo Township. This site

lies on a vacant piece of land, which was formerly used for residential purposes. Based on the
probability of this site being used for resettlement, consultation during the RAP process included
residents surrounding this area who may be considered as the potential host community. Consultation
focused on the Mindolo community near the vacant land in general, and more specifically on people
residing in blocks of flats immediately adjacent to the proposed relocation site.
Consultation with other stakeholders
A range of key stakeholders were consulted as part of the RAP planning process. Details of these
meetings are provided in Section 6.
2.8     Limitations
The compilation of this document was based on three weeks of intensive consultation and community
surveying that built on approximately nine months of groundwork initiated by the project proponent,
ZCCM-IH, and some key stakeholders. This groundwork includes the formation of the AMCO
resettlement steering committee, a census of the community and the valuation of household conducted
by the Government Valuation Department. However, given the sensitivity of resettlement and the
impacts the process has, more time would have served the planning process. Fortunately, community
liaison structures are included on the RAP to maintain the consultation process and keep AMCO
informed.
Costing of the RAP is also constrained by a lack of information. Only once detailed planning
commences can costs be accurately determined. Therefore, the indicative budgets for the
implementation of the RAP and for the livelihoods restoration plan are based on previous resettlement
exercises with the necessary escalation factored into the budget to account for currency fluctuations
and inflation. Budgets have been conservatively prepared.

3       KEY FEATURES OF BIOPHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
3.1     Climate
The area falls into an equatorial convergence zone dominated by warm, moist tropical maritime and
equatorial air masses yielding heavy rainfall by means of convection storms in summer. The climate
of the study area is sub-divided into three "seasons". The rainy season is warm and wet and lasts from
November to March. Most of the annual precipitation (1 250 mm, INR, 1997) falls within this period,
and mean daily temperatures range from 20 to 23°C. This is followed by the cool season - lasting
from April to August - where little if any rainfall occurs and mean daily temperatures range from 15 -
19°C (Envirolink, 1999). After this the hot season occurs, a hot, dry period lasting from September to
the end of October, when mean daily temperatures range from 24 - 31 'C.
3.2     Topography
The Zambian Copperbelt is characterised by gentle relief with a thick soil layer moderating changes in
elevation. Between Kitwe and the Congolese border, the land surface dips towards the south, with a
maximum elevation of 1,460 m occurring at the Kafue/Congo watershed (the DRC border). Ninety
five km south-south-east of this maximum, near Kitwe, the surface is 1,160 m above mean sea level
(Limpitlaw, 2003).
The AMCO site slopes to the south towards the Mindola stream, which is also similar to the selected
resettlement site.
3.3     Soils and Land Capability
Soil formation in Zambia is strongly influenced by rainfall pattems as these affect the degree of
weathering and leaching (Mackel, 1971). In the Copperbelt, high rainfall and low nutrient base rock
have resulted in leached, nutrient-poor and sandy soils (Booth et al., 1994).
Traditional agricultural practices in the Copperbelt consist of chitemene slash-and-bum cultivation
(Limpitlaw, 2003). This type of cultivation is widely practiced in Zambia but is not an option at the
AMCO site owing to intense levels of cultivation by AMCO residents. The settlement adjoins the
Mindola stream and cultivation is thus typical of "dambo" cultivation. Dambos are geomorphological
features and are commonly treeless, grassy floodplains, filled with partly residual and partly
transported soils and clays. Dambos are local water sources, and while many dry out in the dry
season, most retain a water table close to the surface (Mackel, 1974).
The soils of the AMCO site are possibly higher in clay than those of the resettlement site, where the
soils are redder in colour. With access to water, the potential for vegetable production at the
homestead should be higher than the AMCO site.

3.4     Water Resources
The Mindola stream flows some 500m south of the AMCO village. Water bodies, including those
associated with tailings dams, such as the Mindola tailings dam complex, are extensively fished in the
Copperbelt. The Mindola 15A tailings impoundment lies a few kilometres upstream of the AMCO
Settlement.
3.5     Biological Diversity
The ecozone in which the Zambian Copperbelt occurs is a moist savanna, known as the miombo
woodland. Miombo is considered to be a fire-climax because, without the disturbance caused by fire,
the climatic climax vegetation would be a dense dry forest known as muhulu (Limpitlaw, 2003).
Characteristic species of miombo woodlands are Brachystegia, Julbernardia and Isoberlinia (Mfckel,
1971). Under optimal conditions miombo woodlands are characterised by 10 - 15 m tall trees, which
form a light canopy. Species diversity is high and many smaller trees form an irregular lower layer or
understory. The woodland floor is lightly covered by medium to tall grasses and a shrub layer is
frequently present. In some places, and often due to the activities of man, this structure changes into
open grassy woodland with continuous grass cover and an open canopy (Mfickel, 1974).
In the Copperbelt, and elsewhere on the plateau, nearly all miombo has been subjected to chitemene'
or other types of agriculture, and consequently its structure and floristic composition have been
altered and probably greatly simplified (White, 1983). This is typical of both the AMCO and
resettlement site with both areas greatly disturbed with limited natural vegetation (or wildlife)
remaining.
3.6     Overview of Mining Operations
High levels of ore extraction, such as those at Mindola, result in surface deformation. This consists of
(Butcher, 1998):
*     A susbsidence zone immediately above the workings;
*     A zone of ravelling characterised by tensional fractures; and
*     A possible tension zone.
Butcher (1998) reports that subsidence features in the Zambian Copperbelt are usually characterised
by the formation of smooth subsidence troughs with some surface cracking. Sinkholes form due to
' Chitemene, or citemene, means "to cut". It is historically associated with the Bemba people. It is an effective
means of establishing high levels of transient fertility in low fertility soils. Characteristics of the system include
cutting and burning of trees to create ash-gardens, as well as mound creation, where grass is naturally
composted (Limpitlaw, 2003). Essentially a system of mixed cropping, chitemene gardens may be planted with
millet, gourds, pumpkins, small cucumbers, sorghum and some maize (Moore & Vaughan, 1994).

4       PROFILE OF AFFECTED COMMUNITY
4.1     Social Context
4.1.1   National
Population
(Possibly move the following section to annex in final report)
The population of Zambia was estimated at about 10.3 million people according to the 2000 National
census. Of these approximately 5.1 million are male and 5.2 million female. According to the Living
Conditions Monitoring Survey (LCMS), which was conducted in 1998, approximately 62% of the
population live in rural areas, compared to 38% residing in urban areas. The Copperbelt and Lusaka
provinces are the most urbanised. The Zambian population is notably young, with 45% being under
the age of 15 and 15% under the age of 5. A further 24% comprises youths between the ages of 15
and 24. The potentially most productive age group, aged between 25 and 49 years, constitutes only
29% of the population and only 3% of Zambians are over the age of 60. Mortality levels are high,
with 15% of households accounted for in the LCMS having experienced at least one death in 1998.
The highest number of deaths (51%) occurred amongst children under the age of 5, indicating poor
living conditions characterised by poor nutrition and sanitation, followed by the 24-59 year olds who
constitute the most productive age group.
Education
School attendance recorded in the 1998 LCMS can be summarised as follows:
Table 2: School Attendance per age group, Zambia, 1998
Age group     Percenlage attending
school:
5-6            16%
7-13            68%
14-18            54%
19-22            17%
Gender disparities between those attending school change with the age groups of the learners. In the
5-6 year old group the percentage of girls attending school was higher than that of boys, while
percentages in the 7-13 year old age group (primary school), are equal. By secondary school (aged 14-
18), the proportion of girls attending school is lower than that of boys, with disparities increasing
significantly by tertiary level, thus indicating that girls drop out of school at a much higher rate than
boys, especially from secondary level upwards.

Health
The LCMS found 11% of the population to be either ill or injured at the time of the survey. Incidences
of illness or injury were higher in rural households than urban, and particularly high amongst small-
scale farmers in rural areas. The highest level of illness/injury in urban areas occurred in low cost
residential areas. The most common illnesses were fever/malaria (32%), cough/cold/chest infection
(15%), headache (9%), and diarrhoea without blood (7%).
The Zambian labour force totalled approximately 4 million people in 1998, 53% of which were male
compared to 47% female. The total employed labour force in the same year was approximately 3.5
million, also 53% male and 47% female. These figures increased to 4.6 million (labour force) and 4.5
million (employed) respectively by 1999 (according to the central Statistical Office's "Selected Socio
Economic Indicators 2000 publication). This left a total of about half a million unemployed in 1998,
decreasing to just over 400 000 in 1999. The proportion of 'employed' persons aged 12 and above
involved in the informal sector was estimated at 79% in 1998, with 89% being female compared to
71% male. The informal sector was defined as "employment where the employed persons were not
entitled to paid leave, pension gratuity and social security, and worked in an establishment employing
5 persons or less".
The LCMS noted that the majority of the unemployed in 1998 were in the age groups 12-19 (25%),
20-24 (2 1%), and 25-29 (13%).
Of those formally employed, the majority (70%) were working in the agriculture, forestry and
fisheries industry.
Of the 3.5 million 'employed' according to the LCMS, 55% were self-employed, while "unpaid
family work" constituted a further 27%, govemment employees 7%, and parastatal organisations
about 2%.
Income and Assets
Average monthly household income in 1998 was about K204 621 according to the LCMS, while the
official census estimate for that year placed average eamings at K184 281. Average eamings recorded
in the 2000 census had risen to K245 265. The LCMS noted average income in urban areas to be
almost 3 times higher than that in rural areas.
The most important sources of income according to the LCMS were regular salaries/wages (33% of
total national income), and non-farming business (32%). In rural areas the most important source of
income was the consumption of own-produce, accounting for 26% of income, followed by non-

farming business (23%). Regular salaries/wages were the primary source of urban income (47%),
while non-farming business constituted a further 37%.
The most prominent assets owned by households accounted for in the LCMS were radios (54%),
bicycles (30%), televisions (26%), stoves/cookers (23%), and electric irons (21%). In rural areas
radios (38%), followed by bicycles (36%) were most commonly owned assets, while radios, owned by
71% of the urban population was the most common asset, followed by televisions (48%),
stoves/cookers (44%), electric irons (40%), refrigerators/deep freezers (25%), bicycles (23%), and
video players (16%).
Household Expenditure
Food is the most important item of household expenditure, accounting for 59% of total expenditure,
significantly higher in rural areas (72%), than in urban areas (48%). Such high proportional
expenditure on food implies constrained or low household income levels, as indicated by the Engels
Curve. Rural households depend largely on own-produced food, amounting to 43% of total
expenditure (consumption), compared to only 3% in urban households.
Poverty and Coping Strategies
Incidence of poverty measured in the LCMS had increased from 69% in 1996 to 73% by 1998. 58%
of the population were recorded to be extremely poor, 15% moderately poor, and 27% not poor,
according to the 1998 survey. The increase in poverty is mainly attributed to an increase in urban
poverty from 46% in 1996 to 56% in 1998, while rural poverty levels remained about equal. This also
correlates to the fact that economic growth in 1998 was negative, compared to a high positive growth
rate in 1996.
The most common coping strategies households turned to in times of need were:
1. Reducing the number of meals per day (64% of households);
2. Reducing other household items (62%);
3. Substituting ordinary meals with items such as mangoes, pumpkins and sweet potatoes (51%);
and
4. Charity from relatives, friends or neighbours (58%).
Access to Facilities
The LCMS noted that 55% of the Zambian population had access to clean and safe water in 1998.
Such access was significantly higher in urban areas (89%), than rural (37%).

The most common source of energy used for lighting is kerosene/paraffin, used by 62% of
households, while electricity is used by only 19%. The predominant energy source used for cooking is
firewood (61%), followed by charcoal (23%), while 15% use electricity.
Pit latrines are the most common toilet facility used by 62% of the population. 17% of households use
flush toilets, 3% "other" types of toilets, while 19% did not have any type of toilet facility in 1998.
Garbage disposal is predominantly done by digging a pit, with only 3% of households noting
collection for landfill disposal.
Urban households are on average closer to facilities such as a food market, post office, health
facilities, etc., than rural households, but rural and urban households have equally easy access to a
primary school and a hammer mill, and to a lesser extent, to public transport facilities.
Household food production
The majority of Zambian households are engaged in some form of agriculture, either growing crops,
or raising of livestock or poultry, or fish farming, or game ranching, or a combination of these
activities. In 1998 such activities were recorded for 71 % of total households, including almost all rural
households (91 %), and 33% of urban households.
About 71% of agricultural households grew maize in 1998, producing about 9.4 million 90 kg bags of
maize in the 1997/98 season (amounting to about 0.990 kg bags of maize per capita). Local maize was
grown by the majority (59%) of maize growers while 41% grew hybrid maize. Most maize (88% of
total production) was produced in rural areas.
Child Nutrition
Almost half (46%) of children under five years of age, who had started receiving food supplements,
were fed 3 times a day in 1998. Nutritionists recommend children under 5 to be fed five times a day
(LCMS, 1998). Children in urban areas were on average fed more often than those in rural areas.
Children with more educated mothers were on average fed more often than those whose mothers are
less educated.
Vaccines against tuberculosis (BCG) had been received by 98% of children aged 12-23 months in
1998, while over 70% had been vaccinated against Diphtheria, Pertussis, and Tetanus (DPT3
vaccine), and polio, and about 91 % against measles.
Stunted growth (too short for age) was recorded amongst 53% of children aged 3-59 months, while
24% were underweight (low weight for age), and 5% wasted (low weight for height). The incidence
of stunting, underweight and wasting was lower in higher income households, and mother's level of
education.

Community Development Issues
Agricultural requirements, including inputs, credit facilities to purchase inputs, markets for produce
and extension services, were most highly ranked amongst the majority of households surveyed in the
LCMS in 1998.
The second most important requirement was water supply, followed by food, and then the proviron of
health facilities or improvement of existing facilities.
4.1.2   Regional
The study area falls within Zambia's Copperbelt Province. The Copperbelt has dominated the history
of Zambia since the first modem copper mines were constructed in the 1920s. Copper has provided
around 80 - 90% of the value of Zambia's exports for the rest of the century. Zambians from all over
the country flocked to the Copperbelt throughout the century, attracted by the relatively well-paid jobs
and good working conditions offered by the mines. In 2000 the population of the Province was 1.7
million (just over 50% female). Kitwe District, in which the study area falls, has the largest population
within the province, at almost 390 000, almost 51% of which are female.
4.1.3   Local
The study area falls within the Nkana Constituency of Kitwe Ward which, according to the 2000
Census, had almost 80 000 people, belonging to 11 439 households. The Mindolo Ward of this
constituency, within which both the current AMCO village, and the proposed relocation site fall, had
approximately 16 025 people, belonging to about 2 329 households, with men and women
approximately equally distributed. The AMCO community as well as that at the host site fall within
what is known as Mindolo 2 ward, which has a population ofjust under 7 000 people based on clinic
catchment figures.
4.2     Historical Sketch of affected settlement
4.2.1   AMCO community
The AMCO Settlement is located on mine land near Mindolo, a residential area situated on the
outskirts of the city of Kitwe, and has been in existence since the 1960's. The settlement was initially
established as a temporary housing unit for personnel who were hired to sink the Mindola North Shaft
at Nkana Mine. The original intention to demolish the houses after the shaft was completed never
occurred and the original residents who remained, and others who subsequently moved into the
houses, assumed defacto "ownership" of the structures as there were never any eviction actions taken
against these occupants.

Shared houses
During the socio-economic survey conducted as part of the RAP process, it was noted that a number
of households currently share homes. Such cases were noted in 9 of the "households" (as indicated by
house number) surveyed. While in some cases families sharing the house are related, as children grow
up, marry, and share their parents home, in other cases the relationship is either that of an 'owner' and
'tenant' and their respective families, or more than one family of tenants co-renting a house from an
'owner' living elsewhere. A list of households indicated to be sharing houses is attached as Annex 8.
Owners and Tenants
Official, legally binding ownership of the AMCO houses is vested in ZCCM-IH, while Mopani
Mines, which has taken over the surrounding area through the privatisation process, owns the land.
However, it is important to note that a type of "ownership" status has emerged over the years during
which the houses have been occupied, to such an extent that some residents regard themselves as
"tenants" and are paying rent to others whom they regard as the rightful "owners" of the houses.
While some "owners" are still resident in AMCO, others have moved elsewhere but still collect rental
income from the properties now occupied by tenants.
Of the 77 households recorded in the original survey conducted in January 2003 by ZCCM, 58
claimed to own the homes they live in, while the remaining 19 rented their homes. The 89 households
of the RAP survey undertaken in August 2003, reside in a total of 78 houses (no vacant houses were
recorded in this survey), some of which have been physically divided into separate units (block F),
others housing more than one family per unit.
During the RAP survey 52 households were noted to "own" their homes, while 37 families reported
that they were tenants. Three of these families reside with the "owners" of their respective houses, to
whom they pay rent, while 8 units are occupied by 2 families each (16 families). These 16 families
each pay rent to "owners" living elsewhere. The remaining 18 tenant families occupy separate homes
either belonging to absentee landlords (16 cases) or, in 2 cases, "owned" by other AMCO residents.
There are thus a total of 29 "owners", either living in AMCO (5 cases), or elsewhere, who are
obtaining rental income from homes in the settlement.
A list of tenants, including the names of the owners to whom they are paying rent, and amounts paid
for rental, is included as Annex 7 to this report.
Duration of Stav
Table 3 below shows that AMCO residents have been living in their current homes for a period of
between two months and 37 years, with an average length of stay of 9 years, (8 measured by median.
The median, as opposed to the average, is the number in the middle of a set of numbers; that is, half
the numbers have values that are greater than the median, and half have values that are less). This
table shows that owners have on average been living in their current homes much longer than tenants.

Many of the current "owners" are former employees of Mpelembe Drilling, who used the compound
built by AMCO and added one unit, or relatives who have inherited the houses from their original
"1owners". Others claim to have bought the houses for varying amounts, some more realistic than
others. What emerges from this is that the houses, whether legally "owned" by residents/outsiders,
have been regarded as an economic asset which some have been willing to buy, while others willingly
pay rentals, thus providing an income to the perceived "owners".
Temporarv Resettlement of certain houses
In July 2003 it became necessary to temporarily resettle 8 households whose houses were starting to
show particularly severe damage and were considered unsafe to remain in. Table 4 below provides a
summary of the households resettled, dates they were moved, payment of compensation based on the
Government Valuation, and addresses to which they have been temporarily moved. ZCCM-IH has
negotiated a 6-month contract with landlords from whom the temporary resettlers are currently
renting, following which altemate arrangements may be sought. This will depend on progress of

resettlement planning, as well the possible need for additional contingency measures should more
people require such a temporary move due to further damage to houses. ZCCM has agreed to
undertake another structural survey of the AMCO settlement before the rainy season commences in
about October 2003, to determine the potential need for additional contingency plans to temporarily
relocate others who may be in danger of structures collapsing.

Changes in "ownership"
Although the various surveys conducted (ZCCM census, valuation, and RAP survey) correlate for the
majority of households, a number of apparent changes have been noted with respect to ownership of
some of the houses. While the majority of these cases can be explained, certain cases have yet to be
resolved and are being investigated further to determine authenticity of residence. The most
prominent of these is the case of house A16, from which Mannas Chanda, originally noted as owner
of this house, was relocated on 25 July as part of the temporary relocation process (see above). The
RAP survey found this house re-occupied by an extended family comprised of a mother's family, and
that of one of her daughters. The family originally claimed to comprise two households, and has been
thus captured in the register, with a query regarding the authenticity of such a split. It now appears as
though no one should be residing in this house. Attempts to determine the current household's
relationship to Mr. Chanda revealed only vague responses.

Host communitv
The proposed relocation site is located in a vacant area close to the existing settlement, in Mindolo,
between the Mindolo clinic and Mindolo Upper Basic School. (See Map 8). The host community
refers to Mindolo residents living nearest to the proposed site.
Houses in Mindolo were originally built by ZCCM for mine employees. The area on which the
proposed resettlement site is located also used to contain mine houses, but these were demolished in
about 1985, due to being sub-standard housing. The original intention was to replace these houses
with other residential units, but this never materialised. Subsequently the vacant area has been used
for some cultivation, although the particular area chosen as resettlement site has been less subjected to
this than the areas closer to the river.
Other houses in the surrounding settlements which also belonged to the mine were transferred to
sitting tenants as part of retirement/redundancy packages at the time that ZCCM Limited was
unbundled and the various units offered for sale to different mining houses as part of the privatisation
process. In many cases, title has yet to be passed to the new owners of these houses but this aspect is
being handled by ZCCM-IH under its property management wing.
4.3     Government and Administration
The AMCO settlement falls within the Mindolo Ward of Kitwe. A councillor, Councillor S E Kajinga,
represents the ward. Mindolo was a ZCCM mine township before houses were sold to residents and
responsibility for service provision transferred to the Kitwe City Council and the Asset Holding
Company. Water, sewerage and solid waste disposal is managed by AHC while electricity is supplied
by ZESCO. The DA's office is responsible for coordinating government departments and
implementing government policy at the district level while the provincial authorities in Ndola
coordinate government policy at provincial level. The agencies through which this is done are the
District Development Coordinating Committee (DDCC) in each district and the Provincial
Development Coordinating Committee (PDCC) in each province. The DDCC reports to the PDCC,
which in turn reports to the National Development Coordinating Committee (NDCC). The DA chairs
the DDCC while the PDCC is chaired by the respective Provincial Permanent Secretary or Deputy
Minister. Council officials attend the DDCC and the District Planning Officer (a Council official) will
report on relevant development issues to the DDCC. The DDCC meets once a month and PDCC
meetings most probably on a quarterly basis.

4.4.1   Leadership structures
Prior to the establishment of the Relocation Steering Committee in January 2003, the only leadership
structure existing in AMCO community was the Movement for Multi Party Democracy (MMD)
executive committee for the area, known as the Mwanawasa branch of Mindolo ward of the Nkana
Constituency. This committee consists of 24 people and chaired by Mr. Stephen Kasongo, while

MMD membership in the community is approximately 50 people. This committee has been the
structure primarily responsible for overseeing issues such as general maintenance of basic living
conditions (notably the water supply, as well as general sanitation and cleanliness around the
settlement), as well as obtaining, through requests to the Ward Councillor, Mrs Kajinga, transport for
events and other basic services. This committee is also the structure through which disputes and
conflict within the community is mediated. The Branch Committee Register can be found in Annex 9
to this report.
The primary leadership structure present in the AMCO community is the Steering Committee that was
formed on 28 January 2003 to represent the community in the relocation process. This committee is
comprised of representatives from the various blocks in the settlement, as well as a representative of
those renting homes, and, due to the important role they play in the community, a representative from
the MMD executive. The Steering Committee is comprised of the following members:

(F7)                Dories Makamba
Rosemary Mulenga
The reason for Mr. Rodwell Simpamba (originally elected representative for Block B)'s replacement
was that he was among those who had to be temporarily resettled in June 2003 due to the already
severely damaged state of their houses.
When asked what they felt the Steering Committee's role should be, responses from the community
all indicated that the committee's main functions are to represent the community, and relay
information on the resettlement from outsiders (e.g., ZCCM, Mopani Mine, the consultants, and
others) to the community. Emphasis was placed on the committee's responsibility to organise
meetings to disseminate information to the community, as well as to ensure that community views are
effectively transmitted to outside parties. Particular concems the committee are expected to deal with
include matters relating to the rights of tenants, and to ensure that the resettlement proceeds quickly
and smoothly.

4.4.2   Population size and character
According to the original census of the community who are to be resettled, which was conducted in
December 2002, a total of 620 persons were to be resettled. These comprised of 103 adult males, 226
adult females, and 291 children below the age of 18. These people inhabited a total of 77 houses (one
of the total 78 is vacant), equating to an average household size of 8 people per household. Of the 77
households, 52 were male-headed, and 25 female-headed. However, the detailed census and socio-
economic survey conducted as part of the RAP in August 2003 accounted for more households in
total as note was taken of instances in which houses were shared by more than one household, but a
slightly smaller population. An additional 11 households were accounted for by the additional
families, resulting in a total of 89 households recorded. The population accounted for by these
households however is only 583, equating to a smaller average household size of 6.5 people per
household. One possible reason for this is that the original census also enquired specifically about
other persons living in the house at the time of the census, both children and adults, some of who were
not recorded again at the time of the second census since they may have moved on from the original
location.
A complete register of households recorded in the RAP survey is included as Annex 5 to this report.
Age and Sex Distribution
The AMCO community is characterised by a very youthful population, with 46% of the population
under the age of 15 and only 4% over 55 years of age, as can be seen in Figure 3 below. The
remainder equates to 50% between the ages of 15 and 55, which may be considered the potentially
most productive age group. Such a young demographic has important implications for dependency
patterns, as well as for future population growth potential.

The RAP survey counted a total of 583 people, 55% of which were female, and 45% male. The higher
number of women is possibly a function of limited altematives available to them but could also reflect
a higher mortality of men (husbands).
Figure 4 below notes the age and sex distribution of the AMCO population in 5-year time intervals.
From this figure, it can be seen that early-adolescent girls (aged 10-14) comprise a large proportion of
the community, followed closely by pre-adolescent (5-9 years old) boys and girls. These groups are
significant for various reasons. The fact that they are all in potentially school-aged category places
emphasis on the importance of access to educational facilities, and a potential need for additional
resources in this regards (whether it be in the form of assistance to existing schools, or provision of
additional training facilities). Another possible deduction from these age characteristics is a potential
for a high rate of fertility and potential future population growth, particularly considering the large
number of girls who will soon reach puberty. In this regard, factors that need to be considered include
special emphasis on awareness raising programmes especially focusing on (although not restricted to)
girls, dealing with issues such as family planning and AIDS education, and emphasising altemate
roles for women that need not revolve around bearing and raising children.

Of the 89 households heads recorded in the RAP Survey, 57 (64%) are male, and 31 (35%) are

4.4.3   Economic Profile
Economically Active Population
Of the 77 households surveyed in December 2002, 37 household heads were formally employed, 23
were self-employed and had small businesses, 10 relied on farming for an income, while the
remaining 7 claimed to depend on support of family members. The RAP census in August 2003
recorded economic activity of all household members. Of the 264 adults over 18 (51% female)
accounted for, 153 (58%) are economically active, with 47 (18%) indicating formal employment, the
remaining 105 (40%) being "self-employed". Formal employment is significantly higher among men
who comprise 79% of those formally employed (37 people), compared to only 10 women (21%). By
contrast more women (64 = 61%) than men (41 = 39%) are self-employed. A total of 106 people
(40%) were noted as "unemployed", the majority of these (53%) being women. Only 7 "migrant
workers" (6 male, 1 female) were accounted for by the households surveyed. This information is
presented graphically in Figure 6 below:

Households were urged to include agricultural practices members engage in as economic activities,
noting this to be for subsistence/consumption purposes only if no cash income was derived from such
activities. From the Figure above the importance of agriculture is clear.
Apart from agriculture, the most common economic activities are informal trade (25%), small
business (22%) and mining (19%). Trade-related activities clearly form an important component of
people's livelihoods, which needs to be considered in the design of an appropriate livelihoods
restoration! enhancement programme.
Household Income
Average household income of the AMCO community is about K280 000 per month, which translates
to a per capita income of less than K50 000 (US$10) per month (based on average household size of
between 6 and 7 people). Figure 8 indicates the percentage of the population falling in different
income categories, noting that about two thirds of the population earn under K300 000 ($61) per
month.

Average income derived by what households indicated as their "main" activity (as part of all
activities) is just under K300 000 per month.
Average income from agriculture as "main" cash activity, as indicated by 7 respondents, is
approximately K250 000 per month. This figure is inflated by one respondent claiming to earn K1.2
million per month through sale of agricultural produce. Removing this "outlier" from the equation
results in an average of just under K80 000 per month from agricultural activities. Of the 71
respondents who noted agriculture as a non-main activity, the majority (60), noted it to be for
subsistence/ agricultural purposes only.
Agricultural (cropping) activities commonly occupy all those family members not engaged in other
activities. A total of 181 people from the total 78 households who indicated crop production as an
economic activity (both "main" and "other") were noted to engage in this activity.
Mining, which is the most common "main" activity indicated by 16 households, with 17 people
employed in this sector, provides the respective households with an average income of approximately
K450 000 per month.
Small businesses, trading, and informal trade provide an income for 11, 4 and 10 households
respectively, and occupy 27 household members combined. The average income derived from these
activities combined is estimated at about K330 000 per month.
It is also important to note that there are 29 families, 5 of which are resident in AMCO, while the
remaining 26 live elsewhere, who rent out houses in the settlement as a source of income. Although
the legal status of such "ownership" may be in question, the fact that they are regarded as such, and
obtain an income on this account, needs to be recognised in determining eligibility for compensation
as part of the resettlement process. Rental income varies between K5 000 and K36 000 per month,
with an average amount of approximately K20 000. Detail on rentals paid by individual tenants is
summarised in Annex 7.

Income in Kind
In addition to cash incomes, household livelihoods are supplemented by subsistence agricultural
practices. Table 6 below notes the percentage of the population surveyed indicating that they consume
the following crops grown either in gardens around the settlement, or in fields further away. Note that
more than one answer was possible for this question and percentages thus do not add up to 100%.
From this figure maize and groundnuts stand out as the most commonly produced crops for home
consumption purposes, noted by 71 % and 69% of the surveyed population respectively.

Detail on the croplands to be compensated can be found in the Valuation Report compiled by the
Government Valuation Department, included as Annex 4 to this report but details are limited (6
gardens recorded) and no values have been indicated. It is to be noted hat the majority of residents
claim to be farmers. Of the 77 households recorded in the December census, 25 have gardens within
AMCO area, either behind their houses or in the caving area. A further 44 have gardens outside the
AMCO area. Only 9 households have no gardens. However, information on location per resident was
limited so further survey was undertaken as part of the RAP.
Georeferenced, panchromatic, aerial photographs at scales ranging from 1:8,000 to 1:30,000 were
used to assess existing land use patterns in the settlement area. The most recent photography

shape of field sizes. The distance from the Mindolo stream, used by a few residents for watering
certain crops, can also be noted. It will be noted from the map that there are a number of fields
cultivated by non-AMCO residents within the caving area, which is a common problem in many
restricted mining areas of Zambia

The survey established that 43 residents clearly identified their fields, which totalled 13,35 ha giving
an average area of 3 105m2 and a median of 1 762m2. Most residents had one field with one resident
having 5 fields. Total land sizes (including all fields) ranged from 14 676m2 (1,47 ha) to 34m2.
Information obtained from the RAP survey established that 43 residents identified fields close to the
village as opposed to 23 in the December survey. These have been illustrated in Map 5. Presently
these fields and gardens are mainly rainfed. See Chapter 8 for recommendations on replacement and
development options.
In addition to fields near the settlement and within the caving area, it was also noted that community
members make use of fields located far away - "more than two hours' walk". It must be noted that,
although efforts were made to obtain more detailed information on the fields in question, community
members were reluctant to become involved in such investigations, particularly since they emphasised
that their access to these fields would not be affected by the move and would be available after the
move. The list below must also be seen just as an indication of the extent of this phenomenon, since
some community members declined to become part of the discussion, noting that their fields were
"too far away" to record.

4.4.7   Education profile
Table 9 below shows the highest level of education attained by members of the AMCO community.
From this table it can be seen that the highest level of education attained by the largest group (18%) of
the population is Grade 7 (end of primary education). Only 26% have completed Grade 8 and higher
levels of education, and a significantly smaller percentage (5%), have completed Grade 12.
The table also shows that women outnumber men in most primary levels (except Grades 1 and 4), up
to Grade 8, after which men outnumber women at all higher levels, except in one instance where a
woman can be seen to have obtained a university degree.

4.4.8   Religious activities
Religion plays an important role in the lives of AMCO residents, similar to the rest of Zambia.
Community members attend a variety of churches in the surrounding areas, as summarised in Section
4.7.8.
4.4.9   Health and welfare status
The most common illness noted by AMCO respondents to the RAP survey is malaria, noted to have
affected members of 45 of the households surveyed, followed by respiratory problems, indicated by
29 households. These and other illnesses noted are summarised in Figure 10 below:

tL e-                   - ^ -   -  -   P
A total of 60 household members, 20 male and 40 female, were noted to have been ill during the past
month (July 2003). The ages of those ill, range between 4 months and 77 years, with an average age
of 20 years. Of these the majority (18) suffered from Malaria, followed by coughing (14). The high
incidence of respiratory diseases in AMCO village as well as the broader Mindolo environment may
be attributed to pollution and dust generated by mining activity in the area.
Findings from the survey regarding most common illnesses correspond closely to information
obtained from the nearby Mindolo clinic, indicated as the primary health care facility used by the
majority of the SMCO community. According to Sister Harriet Bwele of the Mindolo Clinic, the five
most common diseases in the areas are as follows:
*  Malaria;
*  Respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia;
*  Diarrhoea;
* Tuberculosis (TB);
*  Sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

Draft Report                                                                 AMCO RAP
Apart from STIs and TB, these diseases are particularly common in local children. In the case of the
former, Sister Bwele commented that the clinic had noticed a doubling in the number of infections
during 2002 - 2003. STIs infect mainly the sexually active youth. Peer educators have been trained to
educate the youth regarding safe sex practices. Unfortunately, according to Sister Bwele, miners in the
community feel "invincible" and are thus not concerned with safe sex practices. They also have
numerous lovers and their spouses are therefore at risk.
4.4.10 Cultural and language profile
The community, like the majority of people in the Kitwe area, are predominantly Bemba speaking,
and this is the language used by all in general interaction. People do however originate from all over
Zambia, and other languages that are spoken, if only within households and in the company of others
from their home provinces, include:
*  Mambwe
*  Namwanga
*  Tumbuka
*  Lozi
*  Nyanja
*  Tonga
4.4.11 Security
Security is not considered a serious concem within AMCO at present. This may at least partly be
attributed to the high extent of poverty in the settlement, which makes it an unattractive target for
crime.
4.4.12 Local NGOs and CBOs
There is a range of NGOs working in the Kitwe area. Many of these have religious affiliations and
others are local offices of familiar international organisations. During the consultations conducted as
part of the planning, several of these organisations were contacted. Details of these consultations are
contained in Section 6.
The only comnmunity-based organisations that were consulted as part of the planning programme were
the AMCO RDC and the Crime Prevention Unit of Mindolo.
4.5     Land tenure and use
Land on the Copperbelt as in the rest of the country is classified in two basic categories referred to as
state land and customary land and can be held under statutory leasehold for a period not exceeding 99
years. Mine licence areas on the Copperbelt fall under the category of state land. ZCCM Limited held

land under statutory leaseholds of 99 years on all its mine licence areas. The land on which the
AMCO settlement is situated belonged to ZCCM Limited before its privatisation and since the sale of
the Mindola Shaft and ancillary facilities, belongs to Mopani Mines Plc the new owners of the
Mindola Mine.
In the transition from state ownership of the mines to private ownership, illegal squatting and use of
mine land have occurred on some pockets of land on the Copperbelt. Mopani Mines Plc has put in
place a scheme for allocating seasonal farming plots to individuals in order not to cut off access to
productive land for subsistence farming. This scheme is being implemented on all Mopani land that is
not in a caving area and will be strictly enforced and monitored so that fields cannot be extended or
used by anyone other than the individual to whom the permit is issued.
4.5.1   Land tenure
The land on which the AMCO community currently resides belongs to MCM. It was formerly
ZCCM-IH land, which vested with the new owners upon privatisation. However, as part of the
privatisation process, ZCCM-IH is responsible for a number of social and environmental issues, of
which AMCO is one. Thus ZCCM-IH, even though they do not own the land where the AMCO
community resides, is responsible for the planning and implementation of the community resettlement
programme.
4.5.2   Settlement patterns
Houses are located within 6 blocks as indicated in Section 4.4.2.
4.6     Agricultural activities
4.6.1   Ownership of livestock and domestic animals
The only livestock noted were chickens and ducks, while a few dogs could be observed in the
settlement. Poultry appeared to be kept for consumption purposes. These livestock will be moved with
the community.
4.6.2   Crop production
An analysis of residents undertaking agricultural activities was undertaken, which is summarised in
the following three figures. Figure 11 shows the numbers planting field crops with maize and
groundnuts being the main field crops produced. These are commonly planted between November and
December, but with a range from October to January.

Banana and mango are the main fruit trees owned by residents with sugarcane being a very popular
crop as illustrated in Figure 12 below. Minimal inputs, such as fertilizer, are applied to these trees or
sugar cane.

4.6.4   Agricultural practices
Those engaged in Agriculture make use of very basic methods of production. The majority use no
additional inputs (e.g. pesticides and fertilizer).
Seeds are commonly obtained and stored from the previous year's harvest, or bought from others in
the community or other sources, commonly also stock from previous harvests.
Of 72 respondents who indicated engaging in agricultural activities, 24% indicated using fertilisers,
and a further 5% noted using manure in soil preparation. Only 8% indicated use of pesticides.
In cases where inputs (including seeds, fertilisers and pesticides) are purchased, these are commonly
obtained from the following sources: Nakadoli Market, Chisokane Market, Swings Farm Products,
Swinney Enterprises, and Zamseed.
Ploughing is without exception done by hand by means of a hoe. This limits the effective area that can
be brought under cultivation, thus reinforcing the subsistence rather than commercial nature and scale
of agriculture practiced.
Only 22% of respondents indicated that they irrigate their crops, mostly from the stream, by means of
buckets and other containers, although others use water from the communal tap for this purpose as
well for fields near their homes. Two respondents noted using furrows from the stream, while one
noted sprinkler irrigation.
4.6.5   Utilisation of Natural Resources
Charcoal is widely used as cooking fuel, while some households also noted use of firewood for
cooking and lighting purposes (See Section 4.7.2).

Grass is used for erection of pit latrine and shower screens as well as for fencing around vegetable
gardens. In cases where families have built additional rooms mud block walling is used for
construction.
A number of respondents noted fishing from the local (Mindolo) stream as a source of income, while
some also noted this stream as a source of water for irrigating crops. In such cases water is colleted
from the stream in buckets and other containers.
4.7     Communal infrastructure
4.7.1   Water Supply
The community obtain water from one communal tap in the area. Another communal tap exists but is
not working. Since water is currently obtained free of charge, implications of future rates to be
charged for water provision need to be considered. When asked who is responsible for maintaining
their source of water, responses varied, indicating that few know this. Responses are indicated below
in Table 11, showing that while 10% of respondents acknowledged that they were unsure about the
issue, 46% claimed that it is the community who is responsible, 27% thought it to be Mopani Mine,
while 4% and 3% respectively indicated "Council", or "Govemment" as the responsibility, and 9%
believed some other party (including the MMD and "Nkana Water & Sewerage") to be responsible.

Households currently use on average just over 100 litres of water per day, obtained from the
communal tap. Based on an average household size of between 6 and 7 people, this translates to
between 14 and 17 litres of water per person per day. A breakdown of approximate amounts of water
used per day can be seen in Figure 14 below, which shows that the majority (51%) use between 50
and 100 litres per day.

Although no one currently pays for water, the vast majority (83 respondents) indicated that they
would be willing to pay if piped water were to be provided. Amounts respondents indicated that they
would be willing and able to pay vary between Kl 000 and K150 000 per month, with an average of
K17 000, and a more realistic mode and median amount of K5 000 per month.
4.7.2   Sources of Energy
The primary sources of energy used are charcoal for cooking (83 respondents) and heating (81
respondents), and candles for lighting (81 respondents). Some respondents also indicated using wood
for cooking (11 respondents) and heating (3 respondents), and paraffin for lighting (14 respondents).
Another energy source noted by 11 respondents was batteries, used in televisions, radios and other
appliances.
Although there is a Zesco line running through the settlement, none of the residents indicated
electricity as a source of energy. It was however noted amongst their more important needs and
requirements for post-resettlement.
When asked about their willingness to pay for electricity 83 respondents agreed that they would,
while 5 noted that they would not, due to lack of income. The remaining 4 did not respond. Amounts
households indicated that they would be willing to pay for electricity varies between K2 000 to
K50 000 per month. While the average amount indicated just under K15 000, the median and mode,
both K1O 000 is a more realistic measure of what the majority of households feel they would be
willing and able to pay for such a service. When considering households' ability to pay for electricity,
it is important to consider that they are currently paying for charcoal, candles and paraffin, which,
although cheaper, already make people aware of the concept of paying for energy. When the concept
of pre-paid electricity was explained at a community meeting all agreed that this would be the optimal
system of payment.

4.7.3   Transport, access and communication systems
There are no public transport facilities that come directly to AMCO village. The nearest taxi rank is
located next to the Mindolo clinic, about 10 minutes walk away. In emergencies, particularly related
to cases of illness or pregnancy when community members urgently need to get access to health care
facilities, arrangements can sometimes be made to organise transport through the Ward Councillor
and the local branch of the MMD. Roads surrounding the suburb, particularly leading to Mindolo, are
in poor condition.
Figure 9 in 4.4.5 shows that 54% of the community have radios and 45% have televisions, which can
be regarded as means of obtaining information to on the outside world.
Infrastructure and services used by the AMCO community are shown in below:

4.7.4 Sanitation/ Waste disposal systems
Sanitation systems used by the 77 households surveyed in December 2002 can be summarised as
follows in Table 12:

The most common means of solid waste disposal is through "disposal in a field", indicated by 62% of
respondents to the RAP survey. Other methods used include digging a hole to bury waste (30% of
respondents), or buming waste (18%). Removal of waste to a landfill or "dumping site" is rare but
was noted by 6% of respondents, while 2% noted "other" means, including discarding it in a vacant
house. (Note that more than one response was possible and percentages hence to not add up to 100).
Respondents appeared somewhat less willing to pay for waste disposal, with 16 respondents
indicating that they would not pay for such a service. The remaining 73 households did however
indicate willingness to pay amounts varying from K500 to K50 000, with an average amount of just
over K4 000, and a more realistic median and mode of K2 000 per month.
4.7.5   Schools
According to the original census conducted in January 2002, of the total 291 children below the age of
18, 152 attend schools outside AMCO since there are no schools within the AMCO community.
The RAP survey recorded a total of 204 scholars. When asked about the various schools attended,
responses were received for 155 (76%) of the scholars, the remaining 24% being "unknown" by the
respondent. The schools indicated are summarised in Table 13 below, noting the number and
percentage of scholars attending the respective schools. While some of these schools are far away
(some in Ndola, others as far as Lusaka), and scholars attending them may be expected to reside away
from home to do so, those within the Kitwe environment are indicated on Map 7, in which the
position of the schools with respect to the current settlement as well as the host community are shown.
It can be seen from Table 13 that the largest proportion of scholars (47%) attend the Mindolo Upper
Basic School, which is located just next to the proposed resettlement site. Another 10% go to Salimu
Community School for the vulnerable, which is also located in Mindolo, within easy access from the
resettlement site.

4.7.6   Health care facilities
Since there are no health care facilities in the area, residents all seek medical attention from the clinic
in Mindolo, which is situated approximately 2 km from the community. Some residents also indicated
seeking medical attention at the Central Hospital in Parklands approximately 5km from the
settlement, as well as the Buchi Clinic located near the hospital. These facilities are indicated on Map
7, noting their position with respect to the current settlement and proposed resettlement site.
The Mindolo Clinic caters for the demarcated ward of Mindolo 2, which has a catchment population
of 6 288 people (2003). Both the existing AMCO settlement and the host site are included in this ward
catchment. The clinic has 23 staff, comprised as follows in Table 14 below:

The clinic was involved in an education programme, which involves informing the local populace
about the various diseases, their cause, reasons for their prevalence and means to limit their spread.
This includes basic hygiene tutorials, the sale of mosquito nets, and lessons on nutrition.
Insofar as combating the five common illnesses (See Section 4.4.9), Sister Bwele made the following
remarks:
*  Malaria - draining marshy areas to limit the availability of suitable habitat for mosquito plus
encouraging community members to purchase mosquito nets;
*  Train volunteers to go out into the community and teach a range of health and hygiene issues
which lead to reduced gastric problems, increased nutritional value in the foods people eat and so
forth;
*  Encouraging home-based care for HIV / AIDS and TB patients. Although no proof is available, it
is that that the increase in TB is as a result of an increase I HIV / AIDS.
*  The clinic provides a series of training programmes for no more than 30 adults at a time, which
include a range of health, and hygiene related matters. These training programmes are known to
improve the situation in communities.
Among the communities' concerns regarding health care facilities is the distance that must be
travelled on foot, which although only a "10 minute walk", becomes problematic in cases of
emergency, most notably in the case of pregnant mothers.
4.7.7   Communal facilities
Recreational facilities include a football field for (male) children, located next to the Mindolo Clinic,
and a tavern, which was built by one of the landlords "owning" houses in AMCO. Other recreational
activities include house visits.
There is a communal "gathering place" in the centre of the village where some wooden benches have
been constructed under the shade of a tree.

The settlement also contains an office for the Movement for Multi Party Democracy (MMD), which is
the only existing leadership structure apart from the Relocation Steering Committee.
Community members also engage in recreational activities outside AMCO, including
*  Church events and interactions at a variety of churches summarised in Section 4.7.8.
*  Activities organised at the various schools indicated in Section 4.7.5,
* Bars and tavems in surrounding neighbourhoods.
It is for this reason some AMCO members believe integration with the host community will be
smooth, since people already interact in various social situations.
4.7.8   Churches
Churches that are attended by members of the AMCO community include the following:
*  Catholic
*  United Church of Zambia
*  Pentecostal
*  Methodist
*  7th day Adventist
*  Christian Missions in Many Lands
*  Kimbanguist
*  Watchtower Society
The location of these churches with respect to the existing settlement and proposed resettlement site
can be seen in Map 7.
4.7.9   Cemeteries
The community all make use of the Municipal Cemetery situated on the Kitwe-Chingola road about
2.5 km from the T-junction connecting Mindolo to the Kitwe-Chingola road.
4.7.10 Public safety and security
Security infrastructure for both the AMCO community and the host community in Mindolo, include
the Mindolo Police station, as well as the community-policing forum, situated next to the Mindolo
clinic.

4.8     Host Community Profile
The Host Community is comprised of residents of Mindolo Township, particularly those residing
within close proximity of the proposed resettlement site. A sample survey was conducted in this
community to obtain some indication of population characteristics, particularly with regard to
household size and composition, and economic activities. The survey focused on residents closest to
the proposed site, residing in the flats opposite Mindolo clinic, and in Nkosi and Bupe roads of
Sections Al and A3. This information can be used in combination with population estimates from the
2000 Census to obtain an understanding of the community.
4.8.1   Population Size and Composition
According to the 2000 Population census, the Mindolo Ward, situated within the Nkana Constituency
of Kitwe District in the Copperbelt Province, had a population of 16 025 people, with men and
women approximately equally distributed. The population was comprised of 2 329 households,
translating to an average household size of just under 7 people per household.
The sample survey in the host community was conducted with 15 households, accounting for a
population of 114 people, thus indicating an average household size of 7.6 people per household,
slightly higher than that of the ward as a whole. The larger households commonly relate to increased
incidences of extended families living together as children who are financially unable to move out of
their parent's homes begin to raise their own families in the same homes. This was among the
concems noted in the host community, motivating a need for additional housing space to be made
available following the resettlement, when the area surrounding the site becomes zoned for residential
purposes.
The population of the surveyed households was comprised of 29% adult males, 28% adult females,
and 43% children under the age of 18. This indicates a relatively young and potentially burgeoning
population, emphasising needs such as education and employment creation, as well as housing and
other infrastructure to cater for future population growth.
4.8.2   Economic Activity
Of the adult population recorded in the sample survey, 72% were noted to be potentially
"economically active", defined as either working (full or part time), or looking for work.
State of employment of the "economically active" population are summarised in Figure 15 below,
noting 32% to be formally employed, a further 28% either informally or self employed, while 40% are
unemployed. This figure is the same as that for the AMCO community's unemployment (see section
4.4.3). Informal/ self-employment is however much higher among AMCO residents (40%), while
formal employment is significantly lower (18%). The similarly high rate of unemployment among the
host community could be a potential cause of friction as community members could see the new
community as potential competition for scarce jobs. The higher rate of informal/ self-employment

could also be seen as competition to the smaller proportion of Mindolo residents engaging in similar
activities.

The types of activities engaged in by members of the host community are summarised in Figure 16
below, noting mining to be the most prominent occupation for almost 30% of the population followed
by informal trade and small businesses. This pattem is similar to that noted in the AMCO community,
with respect to sectors of employment other than agriculture. The prominence of informal trade and
small businesses among the AMCO community could be regarded as a threat to those engaged in
similar activities in Mindolo. This could manifest in areas such as common market areas, and
attention should be given to ensuring smooth integration of AMCO traders in the host area's social
and economic frameworks.
Although 1 respondent in the host community noted agriculture, the area's residential status prohibits
extensive cultivation around the settlement, limiting agricultural production to household gardens and
distant fields, as some members of AMCO were also noted to use.

Occupation
Average income among the host community is significantly higher than that of AMCO residents,
ranging between K200 000 and Kl.2 million per month, with an average income of about K600 000
($122). This aspect is worth considering when evaluating perceptions the host community may have
of the resettlers, particularly with regards to matters such as general living standards, levels of hygiene
and cleanliness, social practices, as well as potential criminal activity. Another area of potential
conflict that may arise as result of social perceptions related to well-being, relates to how the host
community will react to seeing AMCO residents resettled in conditions potentially superior to their
own, potentially aggravated by current differences in living standards based on significant income
differences.

5       EXTENT AND IMPACT OF RESETTLEMENT
5.1     Introduction
This section summarises the potential impacts resettlement will have on the residents of AMCO, also
noting the probable extent of such impacts based on information on various aspects of community life
described above.
5.2     Magnitude of displacement
5.2.1   Households
The displacement will potentially affect a total of 89 households, comprised of 583 persons. These
figures are based on the most recent RAP survey that was conducted in August 2003. It needs to be
noted however that there are still some queries pertaining to the eligibility of certain of these
households to be resettled, based on inconsistencies between the final RAP survey, and the ZCCM
census and Valuation report findings conducted earlier in 2003. These cases are being followed up.
5.2.2   Identification of vulnerable persons
Persons/ households who are considered to be particularly vulnerable to any potential shocks3 such as
resettlement may require special attention to ensure ongoing viability of existing livelihoods. Some
such potentially vulnerable groups include the following, identified in the ZCCM Census of the
AMCO community in December 2002 as well as RAP survey:
Table 15: Potentially Vulnerable Groups
Vulnerable Groups                              Number
Female-headed households                                                        31
Households relying exclusively on extemal remittances for income                 7
Households depending primarily on agriculture for survival                      10
Households who have gardens in the AMCO area                                    43
Households relying on self-employment in the form of small businesses for a     23
living
Other potentially vulnerable groups include children, the elderly and the disabled (recorded the RAP
survey) as well as orphans (recorded in ZCCM survey). Details about such individuals within the
AMCO community are summarised in Table 16 below, indicating a total of 189 persons, 80 male and

109 female, who may require special attention as part of the resettlement process. Detail on these
individuals is included in Annex 6.

Children <7           131   51     80          4
Elderly >60            10    7      3         68
Disabled               16    5     11         26

TOTAL                 189   80    1091
5.2.3   Extent of partial or total loss of household assets
Detail on the household assets that will be lost and require compensation can be found in the
Valuation Report compiled by the Government Valuation Department, included as Annex 4 to this
report.
5.2.4   Loss of existing cropland
Certain detail on the existing cropland that will be lost and require compensation can be found in the
Valuation Report compiled by the Government Valuation Department, included as Annex 4 to this
report. Since the land in question never officially belonged to the community, it was not valuated as
part of the process of determining compensation. It is however important to consider use of this land
as an important part of households' means of subsistence, and for this reason a detailed survey of
fields was carried out as part of the RAP process. The results of this survey are presented in the land
use map shown in Map 5 and Map 6. These maps correlate fields with households.
5.2.5   Affected public infrastructure
The impact on existing public infrastructure will be minimal, since facilities to be impacted directly
(i.e. existing within the current settlement), are few, and the proposed resettlement site is within easier
access of most social infrastructure (including schools, health care facilities, churches, and transport
facilities) currently used by the community.
Losses that will be incurred include:
*  2 taps - 1 of which is functional,
* The local tavern belonging to Mr. Augustine Mwaba, for which he will be compensated,
*  Communal space in the centre of the settlement, which could be incorporated in plans for the
resettlement site,
*  The YMCA pre-school, which may be resumed at the resettlement site.

*  A number of stalls belonging to residents and catering for the community, selling items such as
vegetables, fish, and charcoal. These can however resume operation after resettlement. Physical
infrastructure has been noted in the Valuation Report, and will be compensated for accordingly.
5.2.6   Effect on public safety
Potential impacts the resettlement could have on matters related to public safety and security are felt
more acutely by the host community, some of whom claim there to be a strong criminal element
within AMCO. Such fears and perceptions relate largely to the difference in socio-economic status
between AMCO residents, who are regarded as "squatters" who are mostly unemployed and thus
expected to turn to crime, and residents of Mindolo who are accustomed to a somewhat higher
standard of living.
A contrary position which has been noted is the advantage of having the AMCO community move
into the proposed resettlement site, since this area, which is currently vacant, is said to be a hiding
place or escape route for thieves. This will no longer be possible once the area has been converted into
a residential settlement.
For AMCO residents, the more central location and close proximity of the community-policing forum
next to the Mindolo clinic can be expected to result in an improved sense of security. It is however
also true that AMCO residents are currently unlikely victims of crime, owing to their perceived (and
actual) poverty levels. Following relocation their living standards can be expected to improve, which
could increase their vulnerability to crime, particularly theft.
5.3     Affected Economic Structures
Economic structures that will be affected by the resettlement include the following:
1. A tavern belonging to Mr. Augustine Mwaba
2. Various stalls selling items to others in the settlement, including fruit and vegetables, charcoal,
fish, and other grocery items.
3. Houses which are rented out, thus providing rental income to owners
While items I and 3 above have been included in the Government Valuation Report, and will be
compensated accordingly, it is recommended that compensation for lost rental income be provided to
owners who will be affected by this. The period for this compensation should be long enough for
replacement of the structures and for new tenants to be found.
Impacts on crop production as an economic activity is discussed in further detail below:
5.3.1   Effect on cropping activities
Cropping activities affected are:

Draft Report                                                                 AMCO RAP
1. Vegetable plots close to current homesteads
2. Fields used for cropping
Phasing of relocation can be undertaken in such a manner as to minimise loss of field production, as
households will still have access to their fields during the resettlement process both close to the
current village as well as those more distant (located "two hours walk" away). Household vegetable
production losses may be more difficult to minimise owing to the incidence of theft when left
unattended. It is therefore proposed that vegetable gardens be established at the replacement
homesteads before relocation takes place. These new homestead gardens, with access to water, will
largely replace production from fields close to the AMCO village.
Once resettlement has been successfully undertaken, it is recommended that the community be
discouraged from retuming to the AMCO site, owing to the inherent dangers of subsidence.
5.3.2   Effect on fruit trees and standing crops
Detail on the fruit trees and standing crops that will be lost and require compensation can be found in
the Valuation Report compiled by the Govemment Valuation Department, included as Annex 4 to this
report. It is proposed that cash compensation be combined with a mix of fruit tree seedlings provided
to each household.
5.3.3   Effect on utilization of natural resources
Current use of natural resources is summarised in Section 4.6.5. Particular impacts could relate to
reduced access to wood as source of energy by those using it as the move is to within a residential
area with fewer trees around. The more commonly used charcoal will however still be readily
available.
Those engaged in fishing will still have access to the stream, while irrigation from the stream, which
was only noted by a few 22% of respondents, may be replaced through a potential agricultural
assistance programme forming part of the Livelihoods Restoration Programme (See Section 7.4.2).
5.3.4   Access to markets and trade
Access to markets and potential for trade is likely to be improved by the move, since the community
will be moved to a more central position within the same social structures, and utilising the same
facilities, as they are operating in currently. Access to transport will be improved since the
resettlement site is nearer to the current taxi rank used, and this in tum will facilitate easier access to
markets around Kitwe, including Nakadoli, Chimwemwe main market and Chisokone market in the
town centre.

6       VIEWS ON COMMUNITY RESETTLEMENT
6.1     Introduction
A wide range of consultations that have taken place, and which will still take place with key
stakeholders underpins the conceptualisation and planning, and ultimately implementation of this
RAP. The list of stakeholders consulted as part of the RAP planning process is shown in Table 1. It
should be noted that the consultation process did not begin with the start of the RAP planning process.
ZCCM-IH, the AMCO community, the Mindolo community, Councillor S E Kajinga, Citizens for a
Better Environment and others began this process at least as far back as December 2002. This
dialogue assisted the RAP planning process in several ways, most important being the fact that the
community and key stakeholders were already familiar with the intended process.
The intensive consultation process conducted as part of the RAP planning exercise aimed to:
* Inform key stakeholders of the RAP process, its objectives and outputs;
* Solicit the views of keys stakeholders, including the affected community;
* Identify possible partners in the resettlement implementation and livelihood restoration processes;
* Consult with potential service providers;
* Objectively describe the process to the AMCO community.
Minutes of meetings held with key stakeholders are appended (Annex 11). A summary of the key
issues emerging from the stakeholder consultation process are summarised in the sections that follow.
Note that some of the engagements with the AMCO community were not recorded in formal sets of
minutes and therefore are not appended. However, the views gathered during these informal
discussions are incorporated into the sections below.
6.2     Affected Communities
The views of the two affected communities, namely AMCO and the host community, Mindolo, are
presented below.
6.2.1   AMCO
Numerous interactions took place between the AMCO community and the RAP planning team. Of
these interactions, the meetings held with the AMCO RDC, including the key stakeholder workshop,
were formally recorded and appear in Annex 11 as minutes. The AMCO RDC was formed in response
to the impending resettlement and comprises nine members. The RAP team was formally introduced
to the committee on Friday 1 August 2003. Thereafter, the committee was consulted on two occasions
as well as at the key stakeholder workshop. As part of the household and cropland surveys,
individuals from the AMCO community were also consulted. A needs analysis survey was conducted
the results of which appear in Section 8.5. Their views, questions and opinions are incorporated
below.

Draft Report                                                                 AMCO RAP
Compensation:
* The community is aware of, but has not signed off on, the government valuation survey.
* When will compensation take place?
Host community:
* The host community will be jealous of the AMCO community because they will be the recipients
of new houses and services.
* Suggestion that a joint working group be formed to facilitate integration.
Tenants and landlords:
* The RDC suggested that tenants be given plots to build on at the new site, but not houses.
Agricultural lands
* The community was open to the idea that agricultural land be provide on exiting Mopani Copper
Mines land under a formal arrangement with Mopani.
Site selection
* The AMCO RDC has selected the middle option next to Mindolo as the resettlement site.
Services
* The RDC expressed their desire for electricity at the new site.
House design
* The community asked how many rooms their new houses would have.
* The community expressed a desire to see what the Ming'omba settlement at Kasumbalesa looked
like.
6.2.2   Host community
The host community was engaged on two separate occasions - at a meeting with host community
representatives and at the key stakeholder workshop. Prior to engaging with the host community,
there were several rumours focusing on a perception that the host community did not want AMCO
persons to settle next to them because of various social pathologies that AMCO people apparently
exhibited. Upon consultation, however, these views were toned down considerably, although the host
community did express a need for AMCO to conform to the requirements of Mindolo insofar as
behaviour is concerned. The host community had been in contact with the local councillor, Councillor
Kajinga, to discuss their views. She was also present at the meeting with the host community.

Draft Report                                                                 AMCO RAP
The views of the host community which were presented at a meeting on 6 August 2003 are
summarised as follows:
*  Not all of the Mindolo community are opposed to the AMCO resettlement;
* The host community are concerned about AMCO's reputation and wanted them to be educated
and sensitised;
*  The new settlement would reduce crime in the area by developing marginal land and encouraging
settlement by others;
*  The Mindolo representatives expressed a wish that housing plots also be allocated to Mindolo
residents to combat their own overcrowding issues;
*  Mindolo proposed setting up a joint committee with AMCO to facilitate integration;
*  The Mindolo community requested that Mindolo residents be allocated houses in the new areas;
*  They requested a community recreation centre.
6.3     Local Authorities
The Kitwe City Council is responsible for Mindolo where the AMCO community will settle. Their
involvement in the resettlement planning and implementation processes is crucial. Two meetings with
the council took place and it was also represented at the keys stakeholder workshop. In addition,
Councillor Kajinga was present at the workshop and formally met with on two occasions.
6.3.1   Kitwe City Council
The council expressed the following views:
*  Legalities of resettlement - since the land earmarked for resettlement belongs to ZCCM-IH there
is no need to apply for settlement authorisation. However, the current zoning did require
confirmation. The site for settlement would be excised from the existing portion and a new
subdivision created. This subdivision would then be transferred to the council, which would then
issue individual title to the new homeowners. The settlement plans have to be presented to the
council and letters of offer made to the new settlers.
*  Service provision - the area would be serviced but the level of service is undecided. The council
opined that providing the AMCO community with services they could not pay for and maintain
was not sustainable, yet it is equally important for AMCO to be sensitised to the obligations of
what a homer owner must do.
*  Planning requirements - the area would need to be surveyed. The council would provide the
planning services for the new site.
*  Host community issues - the possibility of tension between the host community and the AMCO
settlers was raised. The council suggested that development inputs be directed at both
communities to stimulate integration.

*  Council participation in the process - the council is very important player in the process and its
involvement should be from the beginning. The council should have a seat on the resettlement
steering or planning committee.
*  Influx control - influx of people should be managed and new settlement on the site must be
prevented. Once AMCO have moved, the council would encourage others to settle on the new site
when it became council property and was a site and service area.
6.3.2   Local councillor
The local ward councillor, Mrs Kajinga, has been party to the AMCO settlement from its inception.
The councillor's views on the resettlement are as follows:
*  Community integration - the councillor has been facilitating integration by listening to the
concerns of both parties.
*  Mindolo community perceptions - the councillor conveyed that many in Mindolo view people
from AMCO as prone to unsavoury behaviour.
*  Land availability - the councillor conveyed the community's request that land owned by ZCCM-
IH be given to the council thereby opening up land for settlement.
*  Recreation facilities - the councillor mentioned that the Mindolo Ward did not posses a recreation
facility. The local community lacked a centre where basic skills could be taught.
* Timing of resettlement - the councillor expressed concern that with the onset of the rainy season,
the AMCO residents would be in further danger from subsidence.
6.3.3   Mindolo Clinic
The Mindolo Clinic located at Mindolo Township caters for some of the health requirements for the
local community. It is clearly strained in terms of being able to satisfy the community. For a brief
overview of the area's most pressing health issues, please refer to Section 4.4.9. Although Sister
Bwele did not present an opinion regarding the AMCO resettlement, she did outline what type of
education programmes she would be able run for the AMCO community as part of the livelihood
restoration process. This basically entails the training of up to 30 persons at a time in a range of health
and nutrition related matters.
6.3.4   Mindolo Upper Basic School
The school is one of several to which the children of the AMCO community attend. The school will
be the closest school to the new site. The Head Teacher was met with and he outlined some of the
basic educational issues the ward faced:
*  The school is over enrolled and another school is necessary in order to meet the demand;
*  There is only 1 high school in the area which cannot cope with the number of students in need of
secondary education;

*  Accommodation for the schoolteachers is a problem.
6.4     District authorities
At the district level, the Deputy District Administrator and the District Agricultural Coordinator
(DACO) were consulted. The District Administrator is a political appointee and represents the
national govemment at district level.
6.4.1   Deputy District Administrator
The Deputy District Administrator expressed concem regarding the danger that AMCO residents were
exposed to in the form of surface subsidence.
6.4.2   District Agricultural Coordinator
The DACO was consulted over his possible role in the livelihood restoration process, which will
emphasise small-scale agriculture and improved productivity. The DACO is able to provide training
and extension services.
6.5     Non-governmental Organisations
The purpose of consulting with a range of non-govemmental organisations (NGOs) was firstly to
discuss the type of livelihood restoration activities that could be suitable for the AMCO community
and, secondly, to establish which of these NGOs would be willing to participate in the livelihood
restoration process. Many of these organisations have a wealth of experience in skills training,
agricultural, micro-finance and so on, the very areas that the livelihood restoration plan focuses on.
6.5.1   CETZAM
CETZAM are specialists in providing training in basic financial management skills, financial
discipline, and the benefits of savings to poorer communities. It also runs trust banks and provide
incremental loans to small-scale business people. The organisation also teaches spiritual awareness
and deals with other social issues such as HIV / AIDS, family planning. Given that the AMCO
community will be receiving relatively substantial compensation monies, it was thought that
establishing a dialogue with CETZAM would be beneficial. They are likely to become involved in the
project and will provide basic financial management skills to the community.
6.5.2   Citizens for a Better Environment
Citizens for a Better Environment (CBE) are an active environmental NGO in the Copperbelt. It has
been involved in the AMCO resettlement for a considerable period and was a keen participant at the
key stakeholder workshop. Its track record in monitoring the Kawama and Ming'omba resettlement in
Chililabombwe is exemplary. The organisation was approached because of its involvement with the
AMCO resettlement but also to establish whether it would be prepared to participate in the AMCO
community's livelihood restoration process. CBE's views are as follows:

Draft Report                                                                AMCO RAP
* CBE involvement - CBE sits on the resettlement steering committee and also conducted a census
of the AMCO community.
* Host community - CBE do not foresee any problems with the host community although there
may be some jealousy and vandalism.
* Livelihood restoration - CBE remarked on the need for small business development and
agriculture.
* Agricultural land - CBE stated that if no agricultural land was provided for the AMCO
community, then the site selected for resettlement would be unsuitable.
* Environmental issues associated with the resettlement - the Mindolo Stream is periodically
contaminated with cholera, which, in 1992, resulted in 1 000 deaths. Currently the stream is not
impacted on by mining but by run-off from townships and sewers. CBE mentioned that there were
no negative environmental impacts associated with the new site but if waste management was
inadequate then the stream will be impacted upon.
6.5.3   Mindolo Ecumenical Foundation
The Mindolo Ecumenical Foundation (MEF) borders the site for resettlement. The centre is home to a
variety of religious organisations and has a strong training focus. The site to be settled by AMCO was
previously a mine township, which was raised in the 1985. When the township was in existence, the
MEF had problems with theft and vandalism. This was expressed in relation to the development of a
new settlement in the area. The MEF asked whether altemative land elsewhere was not available for
settlement. The MEF also commented on the high number of orphans in the area, some of who
originate form AMCO, as well as the prevalence of malnutrition amongst AMCO children.
The MEF provides training and expressed a willingness to participate in the training of the AMCO
community. Training programmes centre on, amongst others, welding, brick making, brick laying,
candle making and batik.
6.5.4   Oxfam
Oxfam run a livelihoods programme in certain Copperbelt districts and as such their involvement with
the AMCO resettlement is important. The organisation promotes rather than implements and therefore
works through local partners involved in agriculture, basic education, institution building and micro-
enterprise. Oxfam commented that the Ming'omba community near Chililabombwe exhibited a lack
of ownership and responsibility for their new houses. This was something that was to be avoided with
AMCO. Oxfam expressed a willingness to participate in the livelihood restoration process in a
coordination role. The organisation views this work as a logical extension of its livelihoods work.
Oxfam emphasised the importance of land for agriculture as well as the need for a livelihoods
assessment.

6.5.5 YWCA
The YWCA is located in the grounds of the Mindolo Ecumenical Foundation. The aim of engaging
with the YWCA was to determine what training function it performs within the community with a
view to incorporating some of these programmes into the livelihood restoration plan. The training
conducted includes tailoring, fashion designing, English, marketing and HIV / AIDS awareness. An
issue, which the YWCA representative raised, was that of physical abuse especially of women and
children.
6.6     Other organisations
The organisations covered below are all key stakeholders in the AMCO resettlement process.
6.6.1   Mopani Copper Mines
Mopani Copper Mines (MCM) owns the land where the existing AMCO community resides. The
history of the land is discussed earlier in this report (Section 4.5). The following were discussed with
MCM:
* Access to land - the AMCO community would not have access to their old lands once they had
moved. This was because MCM was trying to halt land-use in caving areas. MCM has initiated a
programme to halt cultivation in hazardous areas but also assisted in finding alternative lands for
people to cultivate. This land was demarcated and farmers signed an application form and were
granted rights to a piece of land. The MCM Community Liaison Officer, together with the MCM
Manager of Special Projects, was coordinating this programme. MCM's awareness campaign had
already halted farming in some areas. According to MCM only three AMCO residents were
farming in MCM caving land: 0 Muyenda, G Mwanamute and J Bwalya. However, only these
three were eligible for MCM compensation in the form of alternative plots. MCM land rangers
patrolled MCM land and monitored settlement and cultivation. A register of users is kept and only
these are allowed into the farming areas. MCM have a ChiBemba / English brochure explaining
their actions.
* Alternative land for AMCO - MCM will consider providing land to the northwest of AMCO, on
the same basis as outlined above, as an alternative for the AMCO community. It is to be noted
that this land will be available for as long as MCM does not require it for mining purposes.
6.6.2   Asset Holding Company - MMS
The Asset Holding Company - Mine Municipal Services (AHC) is responsible for the provision of
water to what were mine townships. The AHC is a private company and the intention is to merge it
with the Kitwe City Council after a period. The AHC was engaged to determine the options for water
reticulation for the AMCO community one they relocate as well as what are the most suitable means
for providing water and water borne sewerage. In addition, the issue of payment for services (10 -
15% collection efficiency in poorer areas) was debated. The AHC is of the view that it is best if a
community divides into groups of 10 households each of which is responsible for payment for a single

standpipe. In terms of the availability of water at the new site, the AHC explained that this was not a
problem. The only issue is to decide what type of water provision would be suitable for the
community. The consultant's propose that every household should have piped water, as a) they will
need to be connected to the water-borne sewerage system and b) have access to water for small-scale
homestead vegetable production.
6.6.3   Government Valuation Department
The Government Valuation Department (GVD) conducted a household asset inventory evaluation,
which included physical structures, business evaluation and fruit tree compensation estimates. The
survey is described elsewhere in this report (Section 7.4). The GVD were consulted and also attended
the key stakeholder workshop. A key issue was that the AMCO community had not signed off on the
GVD report. This was emphasised as critical to the process and a recommendation was made to both
the GVD and to ZCCM-IH that this should take place as a matter of urgency.
6.7     Key Stakeholder Workshop
A workshop held on Friday 8 August 2003 brought together all the key stakeholders in the
AMCO resettlement process excepting for CETZAM, the Asset Holding Company and the
District Agricultural Coordinator. Aside from the absence of these stakeholders, the workshop
was the first forum where the resettlement was debated at length and the main issues brought to
the fore. The agenda for the workshop included the following: Reason for workshop; Workshop
outline & presentation; ZCCM overview; Questions; Golder presentation; RAP process;
Government valuation & compensation; Socio-economic survey; On-going consultation; Site
selection; Relocation timing; Proposed services; Livelihoods; Restoration Plan; Resettlement
implementation management; Monitoring and evaluation; Questions and the Way forward.
The key issues emerging from it are as follows:
The need to disclose the results of the Government Valuation Department survey as well the
need for the AMCO community to sign-off on the survey;
The need to ensure that the community's access to agricultural land is guaranteed;
The general need to ensure that the resettlement does not detract from the affected
community's livelihoods, but enhances them;
The need for the AMCO community to recognise that their resettlement and ownership of
new homes is a responsibility that requires commitment especially for maintenance of the
homes and for the provision of services such as water and sanitation.
A second public workshop is scheduled for the end of September 2003 where the
recommendations of this report will be disclosed to key stakeholders and the larger public. Input

7       RESETTLEMENT IMPLEMENTATION
7.1     Policy Framework and Guidelines
The guidelines goveming the approach adopted are as follows:
* The ZCCM-IH Environmental and Resettlement Framework;
* The objectives of the Copperbelt Environmental Project (CEP);
* The requirements of the Govemment of the Republic of Zambia;
* Sustainable livelihoods approach (SLA)
* The IFC / World Bank involuntary resettlement policy documentation.4
These policies are applicable to not only physical relocation and it's planning, but also to loss of
assets necessary to sustain livelihoods. In this respect, one of the key components of involuntary
resettlement is that the RAP includes provisions for the reestablishment of the affected persons'
livelihoods and that these provisions are supported by adequate financial provision, competent
persons to guide and implement the plan, and sufficient time. An equally important component of
resettlement is that of monitoring. The resettlement process does not end with the physical relocation
of persons to new houses, but continues until such time as the community has been re-established.
The sustainable livelihoods approach will be applied as a theoretical guide to ensure that the various
components of people's lives are accounted for and factored into the resettlement planning. The SLA
is a useful tool for understanding the various components that constitute people's livelihoods and
developing social management plans to reduce and mitigate shocks and vulnerabilities and enhance
opportunities.
7.1.1   CEP Environmental and Resettlement Framework
The RAP for AMCO residents has been conducted in line with the principles outlined in Chapter 8 of
the Environmental and Resettlement Framework for the CEP, dealing specifically with resettlement
issues (see Annex 2).
4 The emphasis of their policies is that livelihoods should be restored to at least the same level as prior to
relocation if not materially improved.

7.2     Process Summary
7.2.1   Consultation
The resettlement planning process has involved a significant amount of consultation with the residents
of AMCO as well as other key stakeholders. Following the decision that houses would be demolished
and the community resettled (see Section 2.5), a meeting was held with the community in December
2002 to discuss the resettlement process, and particularly the need to collect information regarding the
number of people living in the area and social and economic activities engaged in. This first meeting
was attended by 52 community members, who all supported and cooperated with the data collection
process.
Following the initial census, a meeting was held on 2 January 2003 to provide feedback on the census
to the community, as well as to discuss further issues related to the resettlement process, and obtain
comments from the community regarding the process. This meeting was attended by 85 community
members.
On 28 January 2003 another meeting was held with the AMCO community, during which the
Resettlement Steering Committee, consisting of AMCO representatives, was formed through a
process of nomination and elections.
As part of the final preparation for the AMCO RAP, a community meeting was held by the RAP team
appointed on 8 August 2003.
Table 1 provides a summary of the consultation process and Section 6 summarises the views of the
key stakeholders regarding the AMCO resettlement.
7.2.2   Surveys and planning
Once the community had been informed of the resettlement process, an initial survey was undertaken
to determine the size and character of the community. The survey team comprised of 3 ZCCM-IH
officials, 1 from Kitwe Town Council, and 2 from Citizens for a Better Environment (CBE). Four
community leaders were identified to assist with mobilising residents for meetings, as well as to point
out the boundaries of the community. The first survey was conducted on 26 and 27 December 2002,
and aimed primarily at determining the number of households to be resettled.
Activities undertaken as part of the compilation of the RAP involved a detailed socio-economic
survey aimed to
a) verify and update findings from the original census survey, and
b) obtain additional detailed information on socio economic conditions to serve
as baseline against which to measure potential impacts of resettlement on the

Draft Report                                                                 AMCO RAP
community, as well as to guide the design of a livelihoods restoration plan for
the affected community.
In addition to the socio-economic survey, fields used by households for cultivation of crops, both
inside the caving area and outside, were measured and geo-referenced as part of a process to
determine the degree to which the community utilises land and the importance the land is for
subsistence. Land inside the caving area will not be accessible after resettlement, and hence it will be
necessary to find suitable alternatives for cultivation resettlement.
7.2.3   Site selection process
Two alternative sites for resettlement were presented to the AMCO community. The first, at Kawama
Farm, was rejected because of its distance from the social, commercial and agricultural resources,
services and facilities AMCO utilise. The second site, on ZCCM-IH land adjacent to Mindolo
Township, was accepted on the basis that it is very near to the existing AMCO settlement and its
ownership by ZCCM-IH is fortuitous. Up until 1985, the proposed site was inhabited but the
residences were demolished.
7.3     Land Tenure, Acquisition and Transfer
Since the proposed land for resettlement belongs to ZCCM-IH, there is no need to apply for
authorisation for the settlement. However, it is unclear what the land is currently zoned for, and
should this be for purposes other than residential, the land will have to be rezoned. The portion of land
used for settlement would then be excised from the existing portion of ZCCM-IH's land and a new
subdivision created. This subdivision would then be handed over to the Kitwe City Council, which
would then issue individual leasehold (99-year) title to the AMCO community. Prior to construction,
the township layout and house designs would have to be presented to the council and letters of offer
made to the new settlers. The cost of making arrangements for title is ZCCM-IH's responsibility. The
provision of water will be the responsibility of the Asset Holding Company, but the community will
be required to pay for this service.
Given that the area is to be used for residential (and not agricultural) use, there cannot be any major
agricultural activity, other than small-scale home-based cultivation, in the area. Larger fields will be
located on Mopani Copper Mine land some distance - ± 5 km - from the site. This land will not vest
with the AMCO community, but will be theirs to use under a written agreement with Mopani.
7.4     Valuation and Compensation of Assets and Croplands
Following the initial population survey that was conducted on 26 and 27 December 2002, a Valuation
of Assets of the AMCO community was commissioned on 21 January 2003. The valuation was
undertaken by the Government of Zambia's Valuation Department. The valuation covered the
following assets:
a) Houses, latrines, showers, stores, shops and ancillary structures,

Draft Report                                                                  AMCO RAP
b) Fruit trees,
c) Backyard gardens and land used for agricultural purposes within the caving area.
Assets were evaluated between 3-6 February 2003 by an inspection team from the Government
Valuation Department.
7.4.1   Eligibility
The matter of eligibility for compensation as part of the resettlement process needs to consider a
variety of factors relating to different categories of people who may be said to be affected by the
relocation. Such categories include:
1. Owners" residing in AMCO, not renting any property to others
2. Owners residing in AMCO and renting out space inside their homes, which they share with
the tenants
3. Owners residing in AMCO and renting out other houses in the settlement
4. "Owners" residing elsewhere, renting out houses in AMCO
5. Tenants living in separate structures,
6. Tenants sharing with other tenants,
7. Tenants sharing with owners.
Different compensation entitlements apply to each of the above categories of affected persons.
Compensation itself can be divided into various items, including:
1. Compensation for structures lost, as determined by the Government Valuation Survey
2. Compensation for additional structures such as vegetable stands, latrines, shelters other assets
including fruit trees and crops lost, also noted in Valuation
3. Disturbance allowance (20% of the value of structures indicated above) based on the
recommendations of the Government Valuation Department
4. House at resettlement site (including title deeds signifying official ownership) - standard size,
based on replacement size of structures lost (the consultant's recommend that this be increase
by lOmi - see Section 7.8)

5. House at resettlement site - minimum size (the consultant's recommended that a minimum
size of 30m2 be considered for those with units smaller than this and for tenants sharing one
unit - see Section 7.8)
6. Transport of household and moveable assets to new site
7. Compensation for lost rental income
Recommendations regarding how the compensation requirements listed above should be allocated
amongst the various categories of affected parties are summarised in Table 17 below, which also
indicates the number of households per category of affected parties. A "V" in this matrix indicates
that a particular category of affected party is entitled to a particular category of entitlement, while a
blank denotes that it is not. Table 18 indicates the total number of households who will be entitled to
each of the various compensation categories, which is then summarised in Table 19.

7.4.2   Basis of valuation and compensation5
The section that follows is based on the report submitted by the Government Valuation Department:
The basic principle of the law of compensation is that the sum awarded, should, place the claimant in
the same financial position as he would have been in, had there been no question of his land being
compulsorily acquired. This means that he6 should not be worse off than he was before the
acquisition.
In addition to assessing the value of the land acquired, assessments for severance, injurious affection
and disturbance are also made.
Injurious affection refers to depreciation caused by what is done on land taken by the acquiring
authority. Both severance and injurious affection do not apply to the present case because in fact the
land in question does not belong to the settlers.
The amount of disturbance payment shall be equal to:
a) the reasonable expenses of the person entitled to the payment in removing from the land from
which he/she is displaced; and
b) if he was carrying on a trade or business on the land, the loss he will sustain by reason of the
disturbance of that trade or business consequent upon his having to quit the land.
For the subject properties, the issue of disturbance does not in the true sense arise as there are no
fixtures to be removed or some business disrupted and the affected households will be transported to
the new and better homes to be built for them. However, we are of the considered opinion that the

compensation for any "invisible" costs of relocation, be taken at 20% of the total value of the assets
for the household.
7.5     Key Relocation Issues and Management Actions
The following sections outline some of the key resettlement issues and management actions.
7.5.1   Disclosure of valuation survey
See 7.4 above.
7.5.2   Expansion of the resettlement steering committee
A Resettlement Steering Committee was formed on 28 January 2003 at a community meeting. The
formation of this committee involved the nomination of representatives from each of the housing
blocks in AMCO, followed by the election of candidates from the nominees. In addition to the block
representatives, the Branch Chairman from the MMD executive for AMCO was also allowed to elect
a representative to the committee. A representative was also elected from the residents renting houses
in the settlement. The composition and functions of this committee is discussed in more detail in
Section 4.4. 1.
The implementation of the RAP will see the involvement of additional stakeholders and it is
recommended that the Steering Committee be expanded to include these key stakeholders. The
composition of the committee should be as follows:
AMCO community representatives;
Mindolo Township (host) representatives;
ZCCM-IH representatives;
CBE representative;
Oxfam representative;
Kitwe City Council representatives;
Asset Holding Company representative;
Implementation agent;
Mopani Copper Mines representative.
Golder Associates Africa



75                                     5802
The committee should convene twice a month during the initial phases of RAP implementation and
thereafter on a monthly basis. The responsibilities of the committee are to oversee RAP
implementation. The committee is also charged with resolving disputes and grievances and also with
discussing the settlement plans, services and other provisions of the RAP. Expansion of the steering
committee should take place immediately after the appointment of the implementation agent.
7.5.3   Appointment of implementation agent
The implementation of the RAP is to be conducted by qualified experts. ZCCM-IH will be
responsible for their appointment and remuneration, but the team appointed will be expected to liaise
with the steering committee and the working group (see Section 7.5.4). The nature of implementing a
RAP requires that the team is on the ground for a considerable length of time and includes local
expertise. In light of this, it is recommended that the appointed experts are able to maintain a team on
the ground for at least three months. Once the RAP is approved, ZCCM-IH should consider the
appointment of the implementation agent. The agent can then be tasked with funding suitable
contactors, ensuring ongoing communication with the affected community and other stakeholders and
generally take responsibility for implementing the RAP. The implementation agent will be appointed
via a closed tender process and their appointment will be referred to the steering committee for
comment but not for approval. The agent should comprise a team of persons; this could also change
during the process as the demands of the implementation change. It is also advised that ZCCM-IH
retain resettlement advisers during the process.
The implementation agent will be expected to:
Deal with complex issues that will certainly emerge during the implementation process;
Be present throughout the RAP implementation process;
Be experienced with Zambian social issues;
Negotiate with a range of stakeholders;
Skilled in managing community expectations;
Be punctual in meeting deadlines; and
Have budgeting skills, and
Project management skills for development as well as construction projects.
Use of ZCCM-IH's own community and environmental personnel is also expected to facilitate the
resettlement process with the appointed implementing agent. The agent will be expected to take joint
responsibility for liaison with the affected and host communities, and other stakeholders, during the
Golder Associates Africa



76                                      5802
RAP implementation process. This communication should dovetail with ZCCM-IH's own liaison
efforts and structures.
7.5.4   Appointment of a resettlement working group
The resettlement working group is responsible for the overseeing the daily implementation of the
RAP. Its membership, significantly smaller than the steering committee, should comprise:
AMCO community representatives;
Mindolo (host) representative;
ZCCM-IH representatives;
Kitwe City Council representatives;
Asset Holding Company representative;
Implementation agent.
The working group is expected to meet frequently, at least weekly during the initial phases of RAP
implementation and thereafter on an ad hoc basis. Its main responsibilities are as follows:
Finalising the actions contained in the RAP;
Coordinating the RAP's implementation;
Monitoring progress of RAP implementation;
Maintain communication with the affected and host communities;
Deal with local govemment issues, and
Deal with contractual issues.
Appointment of the working group should take place immediately after the appointment of the
implementation agent.
7.5.5   Planning of new settlement
The responsibility for the design of the new AMCO suburb will fall with the Director of Planning at
the Kitwe City Council. Planning of the new site will entail a site survey, site demarcation, both of the
perimeters of the entire site as well as the individual plots, as well as the location of the houses on the
standard low-cost housing plot (size 12m x 27m). Costs involved with the planning of the site will be
Golder Associates Africa



77                                     5802
borne by ZCCM-IH. Until such time as the settlement is completed, ZCCM-IH will be responsible for
any costs incurred.
The provision of services, especially water and electricity, still needs to be finalised. At this stage,
water provision will be provided to each household with responsibility for coordinating payment for
the water falling on the owner. Power supply has been identified by the community as a priority, but
at this stage it is unclear whether power will in fact be affordable. However, it is recommended that
the site be planned and provision be made for main-line infrastructure to supply the community.
Negotiation in this regard will need to be taken up with ZESCO, the Zambian energy supply utility. It
is understood that ZESCO are introducing a pre-paid power option, which could be suitable for the
AMCO community's needs. Therefore, the planning of the new settlement will require the input of the
Asset Holding Company as well as ZESCO.
7.5.6   Conceptual layout of the new site
The map below illustrates the possible location of the new settlement site. It can be noted that the site
is located away from the Mindola stream, where current cultivation is highest, and between the
existing roads in the area to minimise disruption to existing traffic movements but to also to provide
good access during and after construction.

Plans will require the approval of the Kitwe City Council and the Surveyor-General in Ndola.
7.5.7    Preparation of cost schedules
The resettlement process comprises a number of different activities. Many of these will require a
tender process and the drawing up of contracts. An indicative list of activities which constitutes the
physical implementation of the RAP is as follows:
Site survey;
Site demarcation;
Plot demarcation;
House design;
Golder Associates Africa



79                                      5802
Procurement and preparation of building materials;
Site preparation;
Service installation;
House construction;
Garden plot preparation;
Transportation of AMCO residents and movable assets;
Demolition of existing AMCO settlement.
A quantity surveyor will be used to prepare the cost schedules for the various contracts. The timing of
this is shown on the implementation schedule (Section 7.6).
7.5.8   Measures to prevent seKtlement
ZCCM-IH are in the process of obtaining sign boards which inform the public of the intention to use a
portion of the land next to Mindolo Township for the purposes of resettling the AMCO community.
These signboards will discourage settlement on the land and also prohibit use of the land for
agricultural purposes. As part of the community liaison function to be continued by ZCCM-IH (see
following section), the liaison personnel are to regularly visit the new site (weekly) and monitor land
use activities. Prompt erection of these signboards is advised. Using existing structures such as the
Crime Prevention Unit of Mindolo, the local councillor and so forth, ZCCM-IH can disseminate their
intention to use the land and limit its random use.
A further concern in many resettlement projects is the appearance of settlers on affected land. Given
that ZCCM-IH has three registers - their own census, the Government Valuation Department survey
and the RAP survey - of affected persons, the new settlement by persons at the AMCO site can be
controlled. ZCCM-IH has conveyed to the affected community that no further settlement will be
tolerated. If this does occur, then these new residents will not be compensated or resettled. ZCCM-IH
will liaise with the authorities to ensure that new settlement is halted and that agricultural land use at
the new site is discouraged. However, given that construction of the new site will not commence until
at least April 2004, limited farming of the proposed site should be tolerated.
Agricultural land use in caving areas will not be permitted on Mopani Copper Mines' land. MCM
have land rangers who regularly patrol thee areas and are actively discouraging farming in caving
areas (see Section 4.5). Cases of settlement will also be reported to the steering committee.
All key stakeholders are to be informed of the initiatives designed to halt settlement and farming.

7.5.9   Community liaison structure
ZCCM-IH has been in consultation with the AMCO community and other key stakeholders since
December 2002. It is essential that this momentum is sustained and formalised. It is proposed that:
ZCCM-IH have a dedicated team to take responsibility for community liaison up until the
implementation agent is appointed;
That this team communicates with the affected community every fortnight until the appointment
of the implementation agent whereupon the agent will assume responsibility for community and
key stakeholder liaison;
A member of the liaison stricture is to represent ZCCM-IH on the resettlement steering committee
and working group;
ZCCM-IH is to record its formal interactions with the affected community and key stakeholders
and note any major issues that arise;
The ZCCM-IH liaison structure is to prepare a summary of the RAP findings for the affected
community and key stakeholders in ChiBemba and English;
The liaison personnel are to encourage the affected community to continue with their livelihood
activities throughout the duration of implementation of the RAP so as to avoid their losing vital
sources of income or other livelihood benefits;
Affected community members and other stakeholders are to be encouraged to consult the ZCCM-
IH liaison personnel. Responses to their queries should be given and recorded.
7.5.10 Dispute & grievance procedures
Given the sensitivity with relocation and the range of expectations the move is likely to generate, it is
certain that a range of issues will emerge. Many of these will revolve around important considerations
such as timing of relation, compensation, payment of disturbance allowance and so forth. It is also
likely that intimidation will take place and that vulnerable sectors of the AMCO community may be at
risk. In order to allow people to voice their concerns confidentially if required, it is necessary that a
formal dispute resolution procedure be implemented. It is vital that all grievances receive a fair
hearing and that they are resolved to the satisfaction of all parties concerned.
The suggested dispute resolution procedure for the affected community, and also for other
stakeholders, is as follows:
The matter should first be brought to the attention of the AMCO Resettlement Steering
Committee or the ZCCM-IH liaison person, or the implementation agent, or any member of the
working group or steering committee;
Golder Associates Africa



81                                     5802
Upon further investigation of the matter by the ZCCM-IH liaison person or the implantation
agent, a meeting will be convened between the complainant and the relevant community structure;
If the matter cannot be resolved at the above forum, the it will be referred to the working group or
steering committee;
If this body fails to provide the necessary clarity on the matter, then the formal authorities will be
consulted, namely the Kitwe City Council;
If the matter requires legal input, then it should be referred to the legal department of the Kitwe
City Council with full participation by ZCCM-IH;
All disputes and grievances are to be formally recorded and tabled at working group meetings for
the record. The monitoring agent will use these records during the resettlement monitoring
process.
7.5.11 Actual site for resettlement
Although the site selection process is completed at a general level, the exact boundaries of the site
have not been confirmed. This will require the participation of the community in conjunction with the
Kitwe City Council and ZCCM-IH. This should be completed soon after the implementation agent is
appointed. Please refer to Map 8 for the suggested site.
7.5.12 Construction
Once the surveying and town planning of the new site has been completed and accepted by the
affected community, other key stakeholders and the Kitwe City Council and the Surveyor-General in
Ndola, the construction aspect of the resettlement can be initiated. This entails:
Tendering process;
Preparation of contract documents for various contractors;
Site preparation;
Procurement and preparation of building materials;
Service installation;
House construction.

7.5.13 Physical relocation
Dates for resettlement are outlined in the implementation schedule (Figure 17). Movable household
assets will be transported prior to the occupation of the houses at the new site. The implementation
agent and the affected community will agree upon dates for transportation of assets and for
occupation. At this stage, land for agriculture will be formally available to the affected community.
7.5.14 Demolition of old settlement
Upon relocation, the existing AMCO structures will be demolished. This area, on Mopani land, will
be unavailable for agriculture and settlement given that it is on land prone to surface subsidence. An
approved contractor will conduct demolition. All salvageable materials will be made available to the
affected community before demolition. Demolition should take place as soon after relocation as
possible to prevent occupation of the structures by squatters.
7.6     Implementation Schedule
The implementation of the RAP should commence as soon possible after the RAP has been approved.
This serves to manage expectations and also reduces the anxiety of the affected community. It is
essential that the community be encouraged to continue to live as normally as possible until such time
at the resettlement takes place. This implies that their agricultural practices should not be halted and
their commercial activities continue. Delays in implementation also result in changes to the settlement
population, which ultimately renders the survey data redundant. Delays in resettlement also have cost
implications, which are also to be avoided. Overall, the sooner resettlement takes place the better. The
major influences on executing the RAP are as follows:
The onset of the rains determine agricultural practices but also prevent construction of the new
settlement until April 2004; and
The appointment of the implementation agent once the RAP has been approved.
An indicative implementation schedule is shown in Figure 17.

7.7     Organisational Responsibilities and Functions
This section summarises the agents responsible for the financing and implementation of the RAP. It
does not include those responsible for the livelihoods restoration plan.
7.7.1   Administrative and financial responsibility
The administrative and financial responsibility for implementing the AMCO RAP belongs to ZCCM-
IH. Elsewhere in this report its historical obligations have been described. ZCCM-IH will provide the
funding for the implementation of the RAP including payment for the services of experts employed
for its implementation, the construction and relocation of the AMCO community as well as the
funding of the livelihood restoration plan.
7.7.2   Responsibility for RAP implementation
The actual implementation of the RAP will be the duty of the implementation agent and the structures
created - the steering committee and working group - to support its implementation. The roles of each
of these agencies have been discussed previously (Sections 7.5.2 to 7.5.4).
7.8     Budget
The indicative budget presented in Table 21 is based on the resettlement at Ming'omba with figures
escalated to 2003 and adjusted using input from a local architect. A rate of US $240 per square metre
was used to calculate the cost for house construction, site preparation and service installation. A final
budget will be compiled once the various contracts are in place for the RAP implementation.
The size of the houses have been based on the following logic:
Any house less than 30m2 has been increased to a minimum of 30m2 The smallest house is
currently 13m2;
Houses above 30m2 have been increased by a further lOM2 (referred to as "standard houses");
Tenants sharing with other tenants and with owners will be allocated the minimum sized house of
3Om2.
The table below provides a summary of the range in house sizes:

Since the area of resettlement falls within an area for urban development, it will be necessary for each
house to link into the sewerage mainline and will thus require piped water. For this purpose, it is
assumed that water will be piped to two rooms in the house as well as a garden tap. Electrical
connections are not included in the house costs but provision is made for main reticulation for future
connection.
Table 21 below summarises total costs of resettlement, taking account of house replacement costs,
water, sewerage and electrical services, establishment costs, design fees as well as other provisions
identified in the entitlement framework.

Owners not resident on site will be compensated for the value of the buildings, as determined by the
Government Valuation Department, as well as provision for rent loss. Budget provision has been
allowed for 12 month's rent, which should provide ample time for this income stream to be re-
established elsewhere.
7.9     Monitoring and Evaluation
Monitoring is an essential component of the resettlement process designed to ensure that targets are
achieved and standards maintained. An independent monitoring agent must be appointed by ZCCM-
IH, the appointment of which must be referred to the steering committee for comment but not
approval. The agent must have past experience in monitoring of similar projects and be familiar with
the particular context. Initially, monitoring should be conducted every quarter beginning January
2004. After the first year of monitoring, visits should be conducted every six months for at least
twenty-four months thereafter.
Monitoring should:

*   Ensure the implementation of the RAP according to the principles contained in it;
*   Ensure that affected persons receive their due compensation;
*   Ensure the proper functioning of the resettlement support structures;
*   Check that the dispute resolution and community liaison procedures are functional and that
records are being kept and issues addressed;
*   Ensure that the physical relocation of households is successfully completed;
*   Ascertain the well-being of vulnerable persons;
*   Ensure that the demolition of the old settlement is completed soon after relocation;
*   Ensure that the livelihood restoration plan is successfully implemented;
*   Include the submission of reports after each monitoring visit.

8       LIVELIHOODS RESTORATION PLAN
8.1     Introduction
The physical relation of the AMCO community is a relatively straightforward series of events
culminating in the move from the existing site to the new site some 1.5 km to the east. This will
involve the use of a range of contractors whose interaction with the community will be limited to
some employment opportunities for affected persons and others from the immediate vicinity. Of
crucial importance for the AMCO community is their ability to sustain themselves in their new
settlement. Therefore, the livelihoods restoration plan is a vital component of resettlement planning
and ultimately decides the fate of the affected community. On the positive side, the AMCO
community will be relocating to a proximal site and hence will not be removed from places of work,
schooling or health services. In fact, they will be closer to these facilities than before. However there
will be negative impacts, the most conspicuous of these being the loss of their food gardens and other
fields as a result of the move. One must not underestimate the stress caused by resettlement and the
ability of these emotional aspects to adversely affect people's livelihoods.
8.2     Objective
The livelihoods restoration plan is designed to stimulate sustainable development of the AMCO
community such that their standard of living is improved. Elements of the plan are also designed to
benefit the host community, Mindolo. The plan covers land-, wage- and enterprise-based livelihoods.
The plan entails the implementation of social, economic and agricultural projects leading to improved
standards of living and the creation of enhanced local capacity.
Note that the plan presented below is a conceptual plan that requires further elaboration and
quantification.
8.3     Scope
World Bank Operational Policy 4.12 recognises that resettlement may result in severe social,
economic and environmental impacts. These problems include the dismantling of production systems,
loss of productive assets and income and the relocation of people to areas where there is increased
competition for resources. The directive calls for the planning and execution of development
programmes, which provide the resettled community with sufficient investment resources and
opportunities to improve their livelihoods.
The livelihoods restoration plan is for the benefit of the affected community, AMCO. However, it is
not designed exclusively for their benefit and elements of the plan are also directed at the host
community. The selected projects fall within the scope of local development initiatives and
programmes and as such there is local capacity to implement and monitor the initiatives.

8.4     Approach
During the RAP consultation process, several key stakeholders were engaged with the specific
purpose of establishing their areas of expertise, their experience with development projects and their
wiliness to participate in the livelihoods restoration plan associated with the AMCO resettlement. The
key stakeholders consulted, excluding ZCCM-IH, the affected and host communities, are as follows:
* CETZAM;
* Citizens for a Better Environment;
* Councillor Kajinga;
* District Agricultural Coordinator;
* Kitwe City Council;
* Mindolo Clinic;
* Mindolo Ecumenical Foundation;
* Mopani Copper Mines;
* Oxfam;
* YWCA.
In addition, the community socio-economic section contained a needs analysis component. Members
of the affected community were also consulted individually and their needs discussed. A similar, but
very much less extensive, exercise was conducted with the host community at Mindolo. The data
presented in Section 4 was used in the development of the livelihoods restoration plan.
8.5     Needs Hierarchy
Collating the results of the socio-economic survey as well as the outcomes of various consultations,
the affected community put forward the following as their priorities for the ideal type of resettlement:
* Housing:
*  Individual houses,
*  Separate sleeping rooms for adults and children,
*  Separate kitchens,
*  Plots big enough to allow for vegetable gardens;
* Water-borne sanitation;
* Pre-school centre with playground facilities;
* Electricity:

*   Pre-paid or fixed charge;
* Individual household water connections:
*   Families will bear responsibility for payments;
* Market site;
* Hammer mill (milling locally produced grains);
* Carpentry workshop and tools;
* Sewing skills centre;
* Proper waste disposal facility;
* Street lighting;
* Neighbourhood watch security;
* Recreation facilities to promote community interaction:
*   football ground.
8.6      Vulnerabilities
The main vulnerabilities that the affected community will be prone to are as follows:
* Loss of agricultural land;
* Loss of access to fruit trees, although this is limited;
* Exposure to jealousy and other community issues at new site;
* The inactivity associated with waiting and the impact this can have on livelihoods;
* The anxiety associated with resettling and the tendency for timetables to shift.
8.7      Development Initiatives
The livelihoods restoration plan consists of seven components:
* Agriculture;
* Institutional capacity building;
* Health, hygiene & family;
* Financial skills;
* Enterprise training;
* Recreational facility;
* Community participation in the resettlement.
Golder Associates Africa



91                                      5802
Each of these is discussed in detail in the following sections. An overview of each is provided with
timing and costs supplied in later sections. Each component will have to be considered in detail during
the planning phase.
8.7.1   Agriculture
The agricultural component has three constituents:
* Home garden production;
*  Field production; and
*  Fruit trees.
Home gardens
All of the affected community have home gardens for very small-scale agriculture. Given that
agricultural practices are practices by the majority of the affected community, it is important that
agriculture receives the attention it deserves. The aim of the project is to improve the production of
homestead vegetable gardens by providing water as well as intensive training, extension and
supplementing agricultural inputs such as seeds, seedlings and fertiliser. Home gardens will be
developed before the construction of the houses, once the location of house on the plot has been
decided. Extension services will provide training on composting, fertilising and green manuring as
well as on the layout of gardens and sustainable agricultural cultivation to minimise external
purchases. All households will receive seeds or seedlings, an implement and fertiliser.
The District Agricultural Coordinator (DACO) and Citizens for a Better Environment will be
responsible for providing the various services to the affected community. Host community farmers
should be able to benefit from the training but will not receive the various material inputs. ZCCM-IH
will be responsible for funding the training and inputs.
Fields
A number of households have larger fields located further away from the existing settlement. They
use these and other locations on a seasonal basis and shift according to the season. Replacement lands
for that which will be lost is a priority. Mopani Copper Mines (MCM) has agreed in principle to make
land available to the affected community on a formal basis but not indefinitely. This land is not close
to the new site and will require that people walk to and from their fields, which they already do. The
affected community has made it clear that their priority at this point is housing. Agricultural lands are
important, but are not afforded the same status as housing. Therefore, it is proposed that the MCM
route be considered and that each land user be granted a formnal right to use the MCM land for
cultivation. The extension services and training provided by the DACO and CBE should be extended
to the fields. ZCCM-IH will ensure that formal arrangements are entered into between MCM and the
affected community.

Fruit trees
The AMCO community will be moving from a site with mature fruit trees, for which they will receive
compensation, to a site with little or no tree cover. For the purposes of shade and fruit production it is
recommended that fruit trees be planted, with protection, once site and plot demarcation have been
completed. A minimum of five tree species (avocado, papaya, mango, guava, orange) should be
planted by every household. These trees will be provided by the DACO's office and funded by
ZCCM-IH. The DACO will provide training as to the best way of planting each species.
8.7.2   Institutional capacity building
This component has two constituents:
* Capacity building of AMCO / host committee members; and
* Capacity building of community in respect of home ownership;
AMCO / host committee members
The AMCO and Mindolo residents who participate on the steering committee require further
development to enable them to assume a more active role in the resettlement process. The aim of this
initiative is to assist in building the capacity of these individuals to allow them to better input into the
resettlement and other processes. These persons will be trained with skills in transparency and
accountability and allow them to become more efficient and effective. The training can potentially be
provided by CETZAM and the Mindolo Ecumenical Foundation (MEF). Costs will be borne by
ZCCM-IH.
Home ownershiP responsibilities
Although the community have naturally expressed their desire for improved homes, they were
informed during the resettlement planning process of the responsibilities that home ownership
(leasehold) implies. These responsibilities range from basic household care and maintenance to
consideration of neighbours and, importantly, payment for services. Given that the community want
running water and electricity, they too will be responsible for payment for these services.
CETZAM, Mindolo Ecumenical Foundation (MEF) and the YWCA are potentially able to provide
training to the affected community around the responsibilities of home ownership and what this
entails. This will include suggestions as to how best to afford services such as water and electricity as
well as basic home care skills.
8.7.3   Health, hygiene & family
Some of the main diseases affecting the local community are malaria, diarrhoea and sexually
transmitted infections. Some of these can be reduced by very simple training programmes and / or the
purchase of very basic preventative materials like mosquito nets. The Mindolo Clinic is able to
Golder Associates Africa



93                                     5802
provide training for no more than 30 persons, which will cover basics such as family planning,
hygiene and sanitation, and treatment for sick persons. Other issues covered include family abuse and
other social pathologies. This training is also appropriate for the host community.
8.7.4   Basic financial skills
The affected community will be entitled to a relatively substantial compensation and disturbance
allowance. Wise use of this resource is advisable and this requires training. Organisations, such as
CETZAM, specialise in equipping communities with basic financial skills such as saving, budgeting,
business plans and purchasing. One key issue, which will have to be addressed, is whether the
affected persons should receive the entire compensation and disturbance allowance, or whether these
funds should be safely invested and accessed at set intervals. Entrepreneurs may want to access these
amounts for business ventures. This should be planned in conjunction with the community and
financial planners.
8.7.5   Enterprise training
The community expressed the need for skills enhancement, specifically in the areas of tailoring,
carpentry and the provision of a mill. The YWCA runs fashion design and sewing classes and hence is
ideally suited to training those people wanting tailoring skills. The Mindolo Ecumenical Foundation
provides carpentry and related training and can be called upon to provide the necessary programmes.
The community also expressed a need for a mill, which could be provide and become the mainstay for
a cooperative or for a single businessperson.
8.7.6   Recreational facility
Both AMCO and Mindolo bemoaned the lack of recreational facilities. The construction of a small
community hall with rooms and ablution facilities that could function as a gathering centre for
training, religious activities and so forth is proposed. The facility should be equipped with a
blackboard and benches. This would facilitate community integration.
8.7.7   Community participation in the resettlement
There are a range of opportunities where the affected, and host, community could participate in the
actual implementation of the RAP. These include:
*  Employment by contractors;
*  Clearing the new site and preparing agricultural land; and
*  Access to cleared vegetation for charcoal production and other purposes.
The employment of affected persons and persons from the host community should be written into the
contractors' agreements. Obviously, the skills levels would have to be ascertained, but where suitable,
local labour should be used for the resettlement construction process. The RAP will be implemented
in a manner that optimises community involvement and employment generation opportunities. In
Golder Associates Africa



94                                     5802
order to facilitate the involvement of the affected and host communities it is recommend that an
employment desk be created which will undertake the following:
* Register all community members wanting work during the RAP implementation;
*  Register the type of skills that each community member has, their experience and so forth;
* Facilitate the employment of community members by the contractors i.e. a matchmaking role.
This is to be coordinated by the lead agent responsible for the implementation of the livelihood
restoration plan.
8.8     Organisational Responsibilities
ZCCM-IH will appoint an independent agent to finalise the planning and implement the livelihood
restoration plan. This agent should be an individual or organisation with a depth of experience in
sustainable development projects and experience with poorer communities. Ideally a Zambian-based
organisation / individual should be used in conjunction with the necessary outside expertise.
It is recommended that the following structure be established to oversee the implementation of the
restoration plan:
*  ZCCM-IH contracts in the lead agent with extensive experience in sustainable livelihoods, to
coordinate the implementation of the livelihoods restoration plan;
*  The lead agent is then responsible for delegating the various components of the plan to various
competent local agencies;
*  ZCCM-IH liaises only with the lead agent, who have the overall responsibility for the plan's
implementation;
*  The lead agent is represented on the resettlement working group;
*  ZCCM-IH distributes project funding to the agents responsible for the direct implantation of the
plan. The lead agent will require a management fee for coordinating the implementation of the
plan;
*  The lead agent will be responsible for selecting the various agents, but ZCCM-IH will draw up
the contractual agreements and be responsible for payment;
*  The lead agent will submit a regular progress report to ZCCM-IH;
*  The lead agent will also be responsible for hiring agents to monitor the implementation and
impact of the restoration plan;
*  The lead agent will have to keep detailed records.
The development and implementation of these projects requires ongoing consultation with the
affected community. This is required to maintain continuity and also to get buy-in from the
community. As soon as the lead agent is confirmed, a formal liaison process with the community will
Golder Associates Africa



95                                     5802
have to be developed, similar to the one suggested in Section 7.5.8. While ZCCM-IH is responsible
for the successful implementation of the restoration plan, the potential partners identified will be
required to commit to their respective roles.
8.9     Project Development Process
All the initiatives identified above should follow the cycle indicated below:
*  Development of a project committee comprising all actors
*  Preliminary planning amongst partners and community leadership
*  Development of terms of reference for each partner plus a memorandum of understanding
*  Incorporating a strong sustainability component into each initiative
*  Ongoing management
*  Participatory monitoring and evaluation
*  Consultation with the resettlement implementation agent.
8.9.1   Administrative responsibility
The livelihoods restoration plan will be administered by ZCCM-IH in conjunction with the lead agent.
The lead agent will liaise directly with the implementation agent, but the two will have separate roles
with some overlap. The lead agent responsible for implementing the restoration plan will be
represented on the resettlement working group.
8.9.2   Financial responsibility
Responsibility for the livelihoods restoration plan will fall on ZCCM-IH. It will be responsible for the
initial cost of project planning and implementation and monitoring for two years after resettlement.
Thereafter, responsibility for the community vests with the Kitwe City Council and other authorities
involved.
8.10    Implementation Schedule
The implementation of the livelihood restoration plan should commence as soon after the RAP has
been approved. An indicative implementation schedule is shown in Figure 18:
