F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Project Development Objectives (PDOs), as stated in the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD), were to: (i) address environmental liabilities associated with the
mining sector, following the privatization of the mining assets; and (ii) improve future
compliance of the mining sector with environmental and social regulations.

  The wording of the PDOs in the PAD differed from that in the Development Financing
Agreement (DFA) between IDA and the Republic of Zambia, according to which the
Project aimed to assist the Borrower's efforts in: (a) addressing environmental liabilities
and obligations associated with the mining sector, following the privatization of the


                                                ii
mining assets of ZCCM; and (b) strengthening the capacity of its environmental
regulatory institutions to improve future-compliance of the mining sector with
environmental and social regulations. Given that the PDOs in the DFA were, in addition
to being more specific and achievable, the Objectives negotiated and signed by both
parties, the assessment of Project Results in this ICR is based on the DFA version of the
PDOs.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design


1.1     Context at Appraisal

1.     Country context. Zambia is a land-locked country in sub-Saharan Africa of about 753,000
km2 (291,000 square miles) that has maintained peace and political stability since gaining
independence in 1964. At the time of project appraisal, Zambia’s economy had been experiencing
a steady decline in the purchasing power of its copper resources,1 and its per capita income had
fallen from US$752 in 1965 to US$351 in 2002. During the 1990s, in an attempt to reverse the
economic downturn, the Government implemented an extensive liberalization and deregulation
program. While the economy began to experience a modest recovery of 1.4 percent per annum in
1999, poverty reduction remained a challenge due to a heavy debt burden, weak institutional
capacity, and ineffective spending. In 1998, an estimated 73 percent of the population lived below
the poverty line (Zambia Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), 2004). In recent years, at a rate of
6 percent per annum, Zambia has enjoyed a period of rapid economic growth, and inflation has
fallen to single digits. However, despite its macroeconomic and fiscal recovery, poverty remains
high at about 60 percent (CAS Progress Report, 2011).

2.       Sector background. Since independence, copper mining has been the backbone of the
country's economy2 and a powerful force in shaping urban development in the Copperbelt
Province in the Northern part of Zambia where the mines are concentrated. The Government of
Zambia gained control of the copper mines in 1973 and created the state-owned Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) in 1982. As a result of deteriorating copper prices,
reinvestments in Zambia’s copper industry dwindled, productivity declined, compromising
ZCCM’s financial sustainability. Losses reached unsustainable levels, averaging US$20-30
million per month.3 With a view to increasing productivity through foreign investment and
private sector development, between 1995 and 2000, the Government proceeded to sell ZCCM
assets to private investors. ZCCM was transformed into an investment holding company, ZCCM-
IH.4 ZCCM's privatization was expected to mark a turning point in Zambia's economic reform,
providing the basis for improved environmental management, economic stability and growth.

3.     The poor economic performance of the mining sector in Zambia in the 1980's and 1990's
led to an increasingly inadequate handling of environmental issues arising from mining activities.
At the time of privatization, ZCCM was burdened with enormous environmental liabilities
accrued over 70 years of mining operations. The appropriate handling of ZCCM’s adverse
environmental legacy was a key issue during negotiations with private investors who were
unwilling to accept legal responsibility for historical environmental liabilities, given both the
extent and seriousness of mining-related environmental and public health liabilities (See Box 1).
Hence, the Government made the strategic choice to clearly delineate the liabilities to be
transferred to investors from those that would remain with ZCCM-IH and the Government.

  The value of copper exports was halved from US$895 million in 1991 to US$430 million in 2000, before
rising slightly to US$504 million in 2001.
2
  Throughout the 1970's and 1980's, the copper industry was the second largest employer in the country
after the Government, generating about 85 percent of Foreign Exchange Earnings, 30 percent of
Government Revenues and 15 percent of GDP.

  ZCCM-IH became a minority shareholder with 10-20 percent share in the newly privatized mining,
processing and power facilities in the Copperbelt; ZCCM-IH is 87 percent Government-owned.

Box 1: Mining-induced environmental problems in the Copperbelt and Kabwe at appraisal

Air pollution. Copper smelters were emitting               Risk of catastrophic failure of tailing dams. Some
300,000 to 700,000 tons of sulfur dioxide (S0 2) per       tailing dams were located close to human
year. S02 was affecting the health of residents in         habitation; their destabilization due to the lack of
adjacent communities, particularly in the form of          maintenance, and the dismantling of decant
respiratory problems.                                      structures by vandals were feared to cause extensive
                                                           physical and ecological damage and, potentially,
                                                           loss of life.
Soil contamination. S02 emissions from smelters,
after converting to sulfuric acid (H2S04), impacted        Unplanned urban development. Nearly ninety per
soils and caused loss of vegetation downwind of            cent of the Copperbelt’s population is urban. The
smelter stack emissions. Dust particles containing         concentrated demand for natural resources, such as
copper, nitrous oxides and organic acids had entered       water, energy and wood, led to unsustainable use of
streams and affected aquatic fauna. Redundant              water resources, and overdependence on charcoal
chemicals,     and     oil    laced    with   PCBs         fuel by urban households were the main causes of
(Polychlorinated Biphenals) or other hazardous             deforestation. Poor urban sanitation caused the
waste (including radioactive Uranium tailings)             eutrophication of waterways by untreated sewage
further contributed to soil contamination.                 effluents, and the occurrence of noxious weeds.

                                                           Lead poisoning in Kabwe. In addition to copper

widespread negative human health and ecological            (including 9,000 children) were affected by high
impacts downstream from the mines that extended            lead levels in the soil, due to naturally occurring
as far as the Kafue River, its tributaries and             mineralization as well as the impact of the smelting
wetlands.                                                  and mining operations.


4.     Rationale for Bank assistance. The overarching theme of the Bank’s 2000-2003 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Zambia was to support diversified and sustainable growth. The
CAS objective for the mining sector, which represented the main pillar of the Government’s
economic restructuring program,5 was to remove constraints to such growth through the
privatization of mining assets. The Copperbelt Environment Project (henceforth referred to as
CEP or the Project) was specifically identified in the CAS to address the environmental liabilities
associated with the privatization of ZCCM assets. The Project further aimed to synergistically
complement external support to the Government’s privatization process provided by the World
Bank’s International Development Association (IDA), International Finance Cooperation (IFC),
and other development partners.6 In addition to mitigating ZCCM’s adverse environmental
legacy, the Project aimed to reinforce ongoing support to the Government’s efforts to prevent
new environmental liabilities from occurring through new mining activities or mine closure in the
event of a pullout by investors.7

5
  The mining sector remained the major contributor to Zambia’s economic growth, representing an average
share of GDP of 9.1 percent between 2006 and 2009. Further, the sector’s contribution to foreign exchange
earnings and the country’s formal employment levels were 70.3 percent and 8.5 percent respectively in
2009 (Republic of Zambia (2011). Sixth National Development Plan 2011-2015, pg. 26).
6
  Privatization was supported by several World Bank Group operations, including the IDA-funded Mine
Township Services Project (whose Outcome, according to the World Bank Group’s Independent Evaluation
Group, was rated Satisfactory), the Economic Recovery and Investment Promotion Technical Assistance
Program (whose Outcome was rated Moderately Satisfactory), and the IFC-investment in the Konkola
Copper Mines Plc.
7
  The IDA-supported Environmental Support Program (ESP), whose Outcome was rated Unsatisfactory and
which closed in 2003, aimed to help build the capacity of the Environmental Council of Zambia (ECZ) to
fulfill its regulatory role. The CEP was expected to complement and supplement NORAD’s support to
ECZ through the Industrial Pollution Prevention Programme, which also closed in 2003. Furthermore, the

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

5.        Project Development Objectives. The original Project Development Objectives (PDOs),
as stated in the PAD, were to: (i) address environmental liabilities associated with the mining
sector, following the privatization of the mining assets; and (ii) improve future compliance of the
mining sector with environmental and social regulations. The wording of the PDOs in the
Development Financing Agreement (DFA)8 between IDA and the Republic of Zambia differed
substantially from that in the PAD, according to which the Project aimed “to assist the
Borrower’s efforts in: (a) addressing environmental liabilities and obligations associated with the
mining sector, following the privatization of the mining assets of ZCCM; and (b) strengthening
the capacity of its environmental regulatory institutions to improve future-compliance of the
mining sector with environmental and social regulations.9? Part (i) of the PDOs in the DFA was
thus defined more broadly to encompass obligations, defined as contractual responsibilities
negotiated with investors during the privatization of the mining sector as well as liabilities,
defined as the Government’s legal responsibilities for cleaning up mining related environmental
liabilities. Part (ii) of the PDOs in the DFA, on the other hand, was defined more narrowly than in
the PAD by referring to “strengthening the capacity of environmental regulatory institutions to
improve future compliance of the mining sector? rather than promising to actually improve
compliance by the sector, which hinges on factors that are beyond the Project’s control. Given
that the PDOs in the DFA were the ones negotiated and signed by both parties, in addition to
being more specific, measurable, and achievable, the DFA version will be used to assess Project
results.10

6.      Key Performance Indicators. The wording of the 10 Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
in the DFA, albeit not significantly different in terms of substance11 is slightly different from that
in the main body of the PAD; the 10 KPI in the DFA are slightly more specific. 12 The 10 Key
Performance Indicators (KPIs) specified in the main body of the DFA (Schedule 2), comprised of
Outcome/Impact and Output Indicators are listed in Table 1 below.



Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) financed the Environmental Management in the
Mining Sector Project, which aimed to develop the Mine Safety Department (MSD)’s technical capacity to
regulate, monitor, enforce and/or implement appropriate environmental management practices on behalf of
EZC.
8
  There was only one DFA for both the US$19 million IDA Credit and the US$21 million IDA Grant. In
recognition of the severity of environmental degradation and urgent need for remediation in the Copperbelt,
an IDA Grant of US$21 million equivalent was allocated solely to the Environmental Management Facility
(EMF) to be established under Component 1 of the Project to address priority environmental liabilities. The
IDA Credit was to finance the remaining Project activities. The US$4.2 million equivalent of the Euro 10
million Credit from the Nordic Development Fund (NDF) was designed to finance the entire Component 2
of the Project, i.e., strengthening of the environmental regulatory framework; the remainder of the NDF
Credit proceeds was allocated towards environmental remediation activities, with particular focus on the
proper disposal of hazardous substances.
9
  The PDOs in the DFA and the Project Agreement (PA) between IDA and the Environmental Council of
Zambia (ECZ) were identical.
10
   In light of the complexity of the Project, this ICR exceeds the 25-page standard for “regular? projects.
11
   One of the Outcome/Indicators in the main text of the PAD was listed as an Output indicator in Annex 1
of the PAD; and several indicators in the PAD’s Annex appeared to be more results-oriented, for example,
as it specified numeric targets for reducing pollution flow and loads.
12
   Schedule 7 of the DFA lists the same 10 KPIs as the main body of the PAD, albeit not categorized as
Outcome/Impact and Output Indicators, with target dates. The wording and classification of the KPIs in the
main text of the PAD differed from those in the PAD’s Project Design Summary.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

7.       The PDO and Key Performance Indicators were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

8.       The Project’s direct beneficiaries included people living in mining communities in the
five Copperbelt towns15 and Kabwe whose health was expected to improve through reduced
exposure to mining-induced environmental pollution and lowered risk of accidents (PAD). Its
indirect beneficiaries included:
x The people of Zambia, who were envisaged to benefit from a more robust economic position
    resulting from the removal of potential impediments to new private investments in the mining
    sector.

13
   As part of the unbundling of ZCCM, for each mining operation being privatized, investors had to prepare
Environmental Management Plans (Investor EMPs) detailing mining companies’ environmental obligations
as part of the sales agreement. In parallel, Counterpart EMPs, detailing the environmental liabilities to be
addressed by ZCCM-IH and the Government, were prepared for each property sold to investors.
14
   The Consolidated Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) aimed to incorporate the EMPs prepared for
the different investment packages, and looked beyond individual mining sites at ecosystem-wide issues
such as watershed management and air pollution, as well as soil and sub-surface water contamination. The
CEMP ranked issues according to the severity of their potential impacts on the environment, and
particularly on human health.
15
   The Copperbelt Province comprises the mining towns of Ndola, Kitwe, Chingola, Mufulira, and
Luanshya.

                                                     4
x    The Environmental Council of Zambia (ECZ)16 and its delegated authorizing agencies, such
     as the Mines Services Department (MSD) in the Ministry of Mines and Minerals
     Development (MMMD), were intended to benefit from improved regulatory capacity, in the
     form of enhanced competencies of their staff in regard to strategic planning, monitoring, and
     evaluation of environmental issues and proposed mitigation measures.
x    NGOs, the Copperbelt University, University of Zambia, technical institutes, etc., were
     supposed to contribute to and benefit from the strengthening of the national environmental
     management capacity through their involvement in consultancies, studies and targeted
     training.

9.       These primary target groups were not revised. In addition to the key beneficiaries
identified in the PAD, private investors were expected to benefit from Project investments, since
they did not have to incur the cost of remediating environmental liabilities stemming from
historic mining activities.

1.5 Original Components

10. The Project’s objectives were to be supported by two components: (i) establishment of an
Environmental Management Facility (EMF) for addressing historical environmental liabilities;
and (ii) strengthening of the environmental regulatory and institutional frameworks for preventing
future liabilities related to mining.

11.     Component 1: Environmental Management Facility (US$37.5 million). The EMF was
envisaged to support Part (i) of the PDOs by financing and administering, on behalf of ZCCM-IH
and the Government, the implementation of priority measures to remedy environmental and
social problems resulting from ZCCM’s pre-privatization mining operations, in accordance with
national environmental laws and regulations as well as contractual obligations negotiated with
new investors during the privatization of the mining sector. The delineation of liabilities between
investors, ZCCM-IH and the Government was to be determined through the preparation of an
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) by each investor and of a Counterpart EMP by ZCCM-
IH. The EMF was designed to finance subprojects in: (i) the Copperbelt, such as the cleanup of
defunct mine plant sites, removal and disposal of hazardous materials, rehabilitation of tailings
dams in preparation for closing, and the resettlement of settlers in mine caving areas; and (ii)
Kabwe, one of the world’s most polluted towns,17 the treatment of lead-exposed children and
remediation of lead contamination in their living, play and learning environments as well as blood
lead levels.

12.      A Consolidated Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) was to be prepared to identify
funding priorities, and provide the criteria for selecting priority subprojects in the Copperbelt, and
in Kabwe. The Kabwe Design and Scoping Study was to provide the analytical basis for
prioritizing subprojects, according to the severity of the public health and ecological impacts of
the problems they intended to address.18 A Secretariat, housed in the Ministry of Finance and
National Planning (MFNP), was envisaged to handle the day-to-day management of EMF


16
   The Environmental Council of Zambia (ECZ) was renamed after the signing of the 2011 Environmental
Management Act and is now known as the Zambia Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA). For the
purposes of consistency, the Agency will be referred to as ECZ in this ICR.
17
   See Blacksmith Institute (2001). The Silent Death: Lead Poisoning in Kabwe, Zambia.
18
   Furthermore, the CEMP was expected to form the basis for managing environmental issues in the
Copperbelt over a 25-year period, within the broader context of environmental and social sustainability.

                                                   5
activities, notably the preparation and implementation of EMF subprojects.19 The EMF
Secretariat was expected to collaborate closely with ZCCM-IH, which was accountable to
MMMD. ZCCM-IH’s Environmental Coordination Unit (ZECU), the Implementation Agency
for Component 1, was responsible for managing subproject cycles, in close collaboration with
affected communities20 and procurement. Oversight of Component 1 EMF activities was to be
provided by a Steering Committee, chaired by the Secretary to the Treasury. 21 The first three
Outcome Indicators and the first four Output Indicators in Table 1 above were to measure the
performance of Component 1.

13. Component 2: Strengthening of the Environmental Regulatory Framework
(US$4.2 million). Component 2 sought to support Part (ii) of the PDOs by strengthening the
environmental regulatory and institutional frameworks to assist the Government in ensuring that
historical and future environmental liabilities arising from mining activities were addressed in
compliance with national environmental and social safeguards.22 This was to be achieved mainly
by realigning the activities of the Environmental Council of Zambia (ECZ)23 to allocate a higher
proportion of its resources and efforts to its regulatory mandate, and by strengthening the capacity
of ECZ and the delegated authorizing agencies such as the Mines Safety Department (MSD) to
review Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs), effectively negotiate Environmental
Management Plans (EMPs) with investors and with ZCCM-IH, issue pollution permits, monitor
the EMPs, and collect fees and fines. The Project also intended to strengthen NGOs and relevant
training institutions, such as the Copperbelt University, to increase national capacity to address
environmental issues associated with the mining sector. As the executing agency for Component
2, ECZ’s Technical Secretariat was charged with monitoring and enforcing compliance with
Zambia’s environmental regulations for the mining sector, and ensuring that EMPs of investors
and ZCCM-IH were implemented as agreed.24 The Council Secretary within ECZ was to be
responsible for monitoring the overall progress of Component 2. Outcome Indicators 4 and 5, and
Output Indicators 2 and 5 in Table 1 above were to measure the performance of Component 2.

1.6     Revised Components
14.     The Components were not revised.

1.7      Other significant changes

15.    Changes in scope and scale. As the various studies undertaken during Project
implementation revealed an increasingly complex set of environmental issues to be addressed by




19
   See Project Implementation Manual, Volume 1, for details.
20
   Active community participation was to be a core element of the sub-project process.
21
   The Steering Committee, to be chaired by the Secretary to the Treasury, was expected to include
representatives from various ministries as well as NGOs and academic institutions.
22
    The Project was to fund the following six sub-components: (i) revision and harmonization of
environmental regulations in the mining sector; (ii) monitoring and enforcement of compliance; (iii)
environmental emergency response system; (iv) support to the Inter-Agency Committee for environmental
compliance in the mining sector; (v) environmental awareness and public participation; and (vi) ECZ
capacity building and project monitoring
23
   The Environmental Council of Zambia’s name was changed to the Zambia Environmental Management
Agency (ZEMA) following the signing of the new Environmental Management Act in May 2011.
24
   See Project Implementation Manual, Volume 2, for details.

                                                 6
the Project, the need for changes in both scope and scale of select activities became evident.25 As
more detailed information about the type and scope of appropriate mitigation measures became
available during the first two and a half years of Project implementation,26 some of these findings
necessitated further analysis, such as the environmental and social impact study of two uranium
dumps in the Kitwe area.27 In addition to changes in the extent of consulting services, the scope of
physical works changed due to: (i) a higher than anticipated volume of remedial works required
to ensure the safe disposal of radioactive uranium tailings; (ii) the expanded scope of works under
the Kabwe community water supply subproject to permit the rehabilitation of a particularly
dilapidated part of the water reticulation network in two townships; and (iii) the deferred closure
of tailings dams, in line with the agreement reached at Midterm Review (MTR) to explore the
potential for profitable re-processing of 13 tailings dams in light of a more favorable copper
price.28 Given that potential breaches of these dams could threaten the lives of nearby residents29
the deferral of permanently closing the dams was considered a risk to the achievement of the
development objectives. While no dam breaches have occurred since the implementation of the
Project-funded repair and maintenance works, these only provided an interim rather than
permanent solution.

16.      Furthermore, the Project financed the cost of setting up and starting up the Environmental
Protection Fund (EPF) (not to be confused with the Environmental Management Facility (EMF)
created under Component 1 of the Project). Unlike the EMF, the EPF was a statutory entity
established by the 1999 Mines and Minerals Act, and operationalized in 2007 to ensure that
provisions were made and sufficient funds were available from mandatory contributions of
mining companies to cover cleanup costs when mines are closed or investors pull out. The EPF
was to be overseen by the Mines Safety Department (MSD) but managed by an independent
body. While options for the suitable long-term management of the EPF were explored, as an
interim arrangement, it was agreed that the EPF would be managed by the Secretariat of the EMF
for the duration of the Project’s lifetime. Thereafter, the EPF was to be managed by MSD.

17.    Changes in funding allocation. In 2003, the Nordic Development Fund (NDF)
committed to co-financing the Project through a 10 million Euro Credit, which freed up IDA

25
   For example, the extent and complexity of the lead contamination problem in Kabwe was only identified
during preparation of the Kabwe Scoping and Design Study, which carried out a much more in-depth,
block-by-block and house-by-house analysis, than the Environmental Assessment was able to do.
26
   For instance, the CEMP II was conducted in 2004/2005, and the Kabwe Scoping and Design Study, the
CEMP equivalent for Kabwe, was carried out between 2004 and 2006.
27
   A small uranium deposit was exploited at the Mindola Shaft 4 sunk by a company called AMCO in
Kitwe between 1957 and 1960. At the time of Project preparation, the exact location of the tailings was
unknown. It was only discovered during the preparation of the CEMP and promptly brought to the attention
of the Government and the International Atomic Energy Agency (see Blerk, JJ. (2005). Between 2007-
2009, a German consulting firm was contracted to undertake an environmental and social impact study of
the two AMCO uranium dumps in Kitwe (Project files). The Uranium tailings ended up being safely stored
in cells lined with clayey laterite in an existing tailings dam still in use. The radiating soils and lining are
covered by a 2-meter thick layer of copper tailings and topped with soil for vegetation.
28
   A decision was made at MTR to defer the envisaged closure of 13 tailings dams until the results of a
rapid assessment would shed more light on the economic potential of reprocessing. Even though it was later
concluded that the reprocessing was not economically viable based on a geological assessment, MMMD
chose to transfer (sell or allocate) mining rights for these tailings dams to private investors interested in
reprocessing them to recover copper. Given the new ownership of the dams, complicated by legal disputes
over the ownership of some of them, the envisaged closure works could not be completed during Project
implementation, for reasons beyond the Project’s control.
29
   Overburden, waste rock, tailings and slag dumps occupy a significant land area of about 100 square
kilometers or nearly 40 square miles in the Copperbelt and Kabwe.

funds previously allocated to funding Component 2 and selected activities under Component 130.
In addition, the significantly higher than anticipated extent and cost of consulting services
required a reallocation of IDA proceeds from the Credit-financed Works to Grant-financed
Consultants’ Services categories, which was approved in November 2009. 31

18.      Changes in implementation schedule. Project effectiveness was delayed from April
2003, when the DFA was signed until September 200332 due to the delay in the appointment of
the Manager of the EMF Secretariat and a Project accountant, which were conditions of
effectiveness. The Project’s MTR was postponed from August 2005 to February 2006, mainly
due to delays in the start up of Component 2,33 along with the need for more time than projected
to complete studies, and the slow inception of physical works.34 In light of persisting procurement
and disbursement challenges (see paragraphs 36 and 41) two extensions of the closing date for
a total of 36 months were requested and granted, until March 31, 2011.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19. Soundness of background analysis. For the most part, the prevailing conditions were
correctly diagnosed during Project preparation, which took place between October 2000 and
February 2003. The background analysis appropriately comprised reviews of existing analytical
work,35 as well as the preparation of a full Environmental Assessment, which was essentially a
hybrid between an Environmental Assessment and an Environmental Audit, carried out and
disclosed during Project preparation. Environmental issues to be addressed by the Project were
prioritized, based on these studies’ findings. However, while the PAD contained a very elaborate
assessment of ZCCM-IH’s and the Government’s environmental liabilities, their impact and
proposed remedial measures, the analysis of the weaknesses in the environmental regulatory
framework was rather succinct and the proposed remedial measures were too narrow (as per
paragraph 15 above). Nevertheless, it accurately assessed the shortcomings and their impact.



30
    Project proceeds for Component 2 were channeled from the Ministry of Finance and National Planning
(MFNP) to ECZ under a sub-grant agreement.
31
   See November 2009 letter from the Bank’s Acting Country Director for Zambia to the Zambian Minister
of Finance and National Planning (MFNP).
32
   The Project was approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors on February 14, 2003, the DFA was signed
on April 4, 2003, and the Project became effective on September 25, 2003 (see letter from the Bank’s
Country Director for Zambia to the Minister for MFNP dated September 25, 2003).
33
    These were partly caused by prolonged discussions about the Project management structure for this
Component with NDF, as well as about the proposed “salary top up? for ECZ staff. The latter was
controversial as it was to apply to the entire Agency staff, which would have amounted to more than 20
percent of NDF Credit proceeds. It was rightly considered a fundamentally unsustainable measure by NDF,
the Bank and MFNP. An agreement was reached during the February/March 2005 mission that
?supplementary salaries? were to be paid in installments based on agreed-upon performance milestones.
34
    This was partly attributable to the unfamiliarity of ZCCM-IH’s Environmental Coordination Unit
(ZECU), which was responsible for the implementation of EMF sub-projects, with the Bank’s procurement
procedures, and the unsatisfactory performance of some contractors.
35
   These included: (i) Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) for each of ZCCM’s 12 Mining License
Areas prepared with IDA funding by Steffen, Robertson and Kirsten in 1993, which provided the baseline
data and analysis that underpinned the preparation of privatization agreements; (ii) an initial mitigation plan
prepared in 1996; and (iii) interim EMPs for facilities taken over by Konkola Copper Mines (KCM), as
well as for defunct facilities, prepared by Envirolink, commissioned by Anglo American.

                                                      8
20.     Incorporation of lessons learned. According to the PAD, Project design took into
account lessons learned from Bank-supported environmental projects in Zambia, and mining
sector operations supported by development partners in Zambia, such as CIDA and NORAD (see
paragraph 4). The design of Project interventions aligned closely with other operations in Zambia,
as well as the Bank’s experience with mine closure and reform activities in other countries.

21.      Rationale for the Bank’s intervention. At the time of appraisal, the Government was
justifiably concerned that environmental liabilities from historic mining operations might
discourage private mining companies from investing in Zambia. Since the Bank was a major
driving force behind the privatization of ZCCM’s copper mines, it was reasonable for the Bank to
support the Government in addressing the accumulated negative impact of a 70-year history of
mining and poor environmental practices on public health, the environment, and on future
investments. In addition, the Bank brought international best practice experience and convened a
diverse group of stakeholders among whom it facilitated a constructive dialogue, which reassured
the private sector to invest in Zambia’s mining industry.

22. Assessment of project objectives, design and components. The PDOs were highly relevant
at the time of appraisal, and their continued relevance was confirmed during the MTR.36 The
Project’s design was innovative, and one of the first of its kind in the Africa Region. It was
laudable that the Project Components were designed to concurrently remedy past and ongoing
mining-induced negative environmental externalities, as well as prevent future liabilities by
strengthening the regulatory framework and enforcement in order to boost the mining sector’s
compliance with environmental and social regulations. However, the approach was rather
complex, and, in retrospect, achieving the proposed outcomes within the original timeframe of the
Project (5 years) was overly optimistic, particularly in light of the status quo. 37

23. With regard to Component 1, it is commendable that, rather than addressing environmental
liabilities and obligations in a piecemeal fashion, the selection of Project interventions was
designed to be guided by a CEMP aimed to prioritize measures for addressing mining related
externalities in a comprehensive fashion, using a risk-based methodology. The lead
contamination mitigation program in Kabwe, for example, was an excellent, well thought-out,
holistic high priority intervention package designed to treat lead-affected children medically, as
well as to reduce their exposure to renewed contamination in their physical living, playing and
learning environments.

24.     While a substantial amount of time and effort was put into the design of Component 1, as
evidenced for example, by the comprehensive Volume 1 of the Project Implementation Manual
(PIM) pertaining to this Component, the design of Component 2 and the corresponding Volume 2
of the PIM were less detailed but did contain performance indicators for each of the six sub-
components of Component 2. Also, the 14-month delay38 in the start up of Component 2 activities



36
   As noted in paragraph 33, Part (ii) of the PDOs, as formulated in the PAD, was unrealistic to achieve
during a 5-year Project life, given that it aimed to improve not only the capacity of ECZ but also committed
to improving the mining sector’s compliance with environmental regulations.
37
   As pointed out by a member of the Project design team, a simpler approach had initially been pursued but
was deemed not feasible for political economy reasons. The split of implementation and regulatory
responsibilities between ZCCM-IH, responsible for implementing the EMF, and the Environmental Council
of Zambia (ECZ) was considered crucial in order to prevent regulatory capture by the Ministry of Finance.
38
   Due to late availability of funds, implementation of Component 2 started effectively in November 2004
(see Ginet, 2006. Backstopping Report).

                                                     9
and the fact that Bank Management called for restructuring of Component 2 only eight months
after Project effectiveness, indicated design weaknesses.39

25. Implementation arrangements. As noted by a cross-section of stakeholders consulted
during the ICR mission, the implementation arrangements for Component 1 were satisfactory,
including the overall oversight of EMF activities by the EMF Steering Committee. However, it
was noted that more independent oversight of the EMF Secretariat, as opposed to an EMF
secretariat housed in the Ministry of Finance, would have been preferable. The selection of
ZECU, ZCCM-IH’s environmental management arm, to implement mitigation measures was a
good choice, given their familiarity with and vested interest in addressing pressing environmental
and social issues. The selection of the ECZ Secretariat as the principal implementing agency for
Component 2 was reasonable from an institutional point of view,40 yet problematic in practical
terms, given that, despite ECZ’s institutional weakness, the principal implementation
responsibility for Component 2 was placed on ECZ, relying on its ineffective operational
structure. As several stakeholders later pointed out, it would have been preferable if the oversight
of both Components had been combined under one overarching institutional umbrella.

26.       Adequacy of Government commitment. At the time of appraisal, the Government’s
commitment was inferred from its adoption of environmental legislation, institutional reforms,
and the creation of the ECZ in 1991.41 The fact that the Government agreed to the reallocation of
about US$7 million from the Labor Reduction Program (LRP) to address urgent mitigation
measures, as well as the request and subsequent provision of a Preparation Advance for the
Project, indicated tangible Government commitment, particularly to Component 1 of the Project.
Given that the environmental liabilities were feared to impede the privatization process, the
Government and ZCCM-IH42 were motivated to assume and mitigate historical environmental
liabilities. With regard to Component 2, Government commitment was less evident, especially
since the restructuring plan for MSD developed with support from CIDA in order to grant MSD
more autonomy and capacity, was not endorsed by the Government.43

27. Stakeholder involvement and participatory processes. At the time of appraisal, active
involvement in particular of affected communities, local authorities, and line ministries in the
Project was considered essential for the sustainability of remedial works to be carried out under
the Project (see PAD). The Project Implementation Manual for Component 1 included an
elaborate communication and participation strategy intended to guide the structure and
procedures for stakeholder participation. While the PAD envisaged systematic consultation and

39
   According to a member of the Project preparation team, the process of ECZ reform began under the
Environmental Support Project (ESP). A Draft Plan for Action for ECZ had been developed as part of the
ESP but not implemented due to its premature termination. Component 2 of the CEP was prepared and
funded by NDF. Even though there was close coordination between the Bank and NDF teams prior to
effectiveness, it appears that the thinking spelled out in the Draft Plan of Action might not have been fully
captured during preparation or pursued during implementation.
40
   The selection of ECZ over the Mine Safety Department (MSD) was justified by the need for oversight by
an entity tackling environmental issues from a broader, i.e. not exclusively mining-focused, perspective.
41
   However, no reference was found in the Project documentation as to the extent to which compliance with
these provisions was enforced.
42
   At the time of appraisal, ZCCM-IH had already initiated public meetings to discuss the proposed Project
with people living in close proximity to targeted sites.
43
   A restructuring plan for MSD was developed under the CIDA-supported Environmental Management in
the Mining Sector Project, which closed in 2004. A draft bill was prepared but reportedly not submitted to
Cabinet for approval. Since then MSD has continued to operate at low capacity. Due to high turnover and
reportedly low salaries, only half of its existing positions are presently filled.

                                                     10
participation of stakeholders in the design of measures that might affect them, it appears that the
selection and identification of subprojects was done primarily by ZECU, with only limited
involvement of communities throughout the subproject project cycle. While community
consultations were extensive during the preparation of the CEMP, i.e., the identification of
potential subprojects, the extent of community involvement in the implementation of remedial
subprojects, e.g., through labor-intensive public works opportunities, was lower than anticipated,
and may have adversely affected their ownership and sustainability.44 On the other hand,
households that benefited from community-based works in Kabwe seemed to value and maintain
their newly greened yards that reduced lead dust exposure.

28. Assessment of Risks. In hindsight, a number of risks were underestimated or not
acknowledged. For example, the risk of insufficient commitment by the Government to
improving environmental management of the mining sector and enforcing environmental
regulations was rated Substantial rather than High. Some signs apparent at appraisal that would
appear to have supported the higher risk rating include: (i) the Government’s reluctance to
approve the CIDA-supported restructuring of the MSD, which would have granted this key
enforcement agency more autonomy and capacity; and (ii) the fact that the less stringent
environmental standards, compared to other industries, applied to investors during privatization
might have indicated the Government’s continuing reluctance to “get tough? and hold mining
companies that were not in compliance with their EMPs and environmental standards
accountable.45 Furthermore, the overall rating should have reflected that this was going to be a
rather complex, one of the first of its kind, high-risk Project. Moreover, it was overly optimistic
to expect the government to achieve all these changes in such a short time, when experience from
developing and developed countries shows that restructuring of agencies needs to be
appropriately paced and financed. As such, it is very possible that what in hindsight seems like
reluctance of the government to effect some of these changes is, in fact, a case of too much, too
soon.

2.2 Implementation

29. Project changes. In an effort to remedy the slow progress highlighted in Implementation
Status Reports (ISRs), several changes in Project design, allocation of funds, and implementation
arrangements were agreed at various stages. While earlier delays, caused by safeguards,
procurement, and technical processing issues were successfully addressed, persistent procurement
and disbursement problems impeded the pace of implementation throughout the Project’s
lifetime.

30.     Extension of Closing Date and DFA Amendment. A first extension of the closing date
from August 2008 to March 2010 requested to accommodate the slower than expected
implementation pace, was approved by the Bank’s Country Director for Zambia46 in July 2008. A
request for Project restructuring (2nd order) was approved by the Regional Vice President (RVP)



44
   While the procurement methods and disbursement categories did not allow for community participation,
the proposed community grants category foresaw a more active community role in the subproject cycle.
45
   Several investors were permitted, as part of their sales agreements, to exceed national standards, as long
as the pollution levels remained within the targets set out in the EMPs.
46
   In his March 4, 2008 letter to the Bank’s Country Director the Zambian Secretary of the Treasury
formally requested an extension of the closing date. The approval of an extension until March 31, 2010 was
communicated to the Government in the Country Director’s letter to the Zambian Secretary of the Treasury
dated July 29, 2008.

                                                     11
in March 2010.47 The purpose of the restructuring was to extend the Project’s closing date until
March 31, 2011 in order to: (i) conclude most of the remediation actions underway at the time;
(ii) allow sufficient time to “do it right? given that this “operation [was] one of the first of its kind
in Africa and there [were] many lessons to be learned;? (iii) develop capacity in the involved
agencies and ownership for maintenance; (iv) involve affected communities more deeply in the
management of sites; and (v) facilitate stronger involvement from private mining companies and
the need to ensure sustainability of the recently set up Environmental Protection Fund.

31.      In November 2009,48 the DFA was amended to reallocate Project proceeds, given that: (i)
a significant portion of IDA funding was freed up as a result of co-financing of the Project by the
NDF; and (ii) the 2006 Midterm Review (MTR) had called for a reallocation of funds (and
amendment of procurement thresholds) among the different disbursement categories to reflect the
actual financing requirements under the Consultants and Works categories.49

32.      Midterm Review. By the MTR, it had become evident that the allocation of Project
proceeds for consultancies was insufficient.50 Lingering procurement and related financial
management and disbursement problems prevented the timely replenishment of the EMF’s
Special Account and slowed down Project implementation. (Even though the Project closing date
was extended twice, unresolved disbursement issues carried over into the extension and
disbursement grace period.) In parallel to addressing the above issues, given that the funding
allocations in the DFA did not seem to match the Project’s actual resource requirements under the
respective disbursement categories, Bank Management urged the team to see to the timely
amendment of the DFA and to identify “surplus funds that should either be cancelled or
justifiably redeployed even if this may require major restructuring?. Nevertheless, the Grant and
Credit proceeds were not reallocated until November 2009 due to insufficient follow through on
the part of the Bank’s supervision team.

33.      Changes in Project Design and Scope agreed during Midterm Review. One of the key
changes recommended by stakeholders51 during the MTR mission was to “systematize … a
clearer link between socio-economic development and environmental remediation, through the
involvement of local communities in the maintenance of sites and/or developing economic
activities around such sites.? To this end, a new Community Development Small Grant category,
i.e., a mini social fund to finance small scale, demand-driven investments, preferably in income
generating activities, was to be created in the process of amending the DFA. While labor
intensive subprojects, such the manual spreading of materials dredged from the Luanshya River
had provided temporary employment opportunities for local communities, and limited support
was provided to income-generating women’s groups, the community subproject component did
not materialize. This was partly due to the Amendment to the DFA being delayed by three and a

47
    The description and scope of the Project’s Components remained unchanged during the Project’s
restructuring and DFA amendments.
48
   See Amendment Letter signed by the Acting Country Director for Zambia on November 19, 2009 and
countersigned on November 27, 2009 by the Zambian Minister MFNP.
49
   In fact, the need for a DFA Amendment to reflect NDF co-financing and adjust IDA commitments was
recognized and recorded even before the Project became effective.
50
    The Grant-financed Consultancy Services disbursement category was soon depleted and ZECU
proceeded to pay consultants by “borrowing? Credit proceeds from the works category. Since ZECU was
not able to furnish receipts for eligible expenditures under the Works category, withdrawal applications
were not approved by the Bank’s Disbursement Department, causing cash flow problems and
implementation delays.
51
   During the MTR mission, a stakeholder forum was held in Kitwe with 60 stakeholders from local
governments, local communities, NGOs, media, church, and the mining industry.

                                                   12
half years (see paragraph 30) as well as concerns expressed by the Africa Region’s Legal
Department that adding a community component would make this already very ambitious Project
too complex and implementation possibly even slower.

34.     Other changes agreed during MTR included: (i) the deferral of the planned rehabilitation
and permanent closure of 13 tailings dams due to their potential for reprocessing (see paragraph
15 above); (ii) the need for ZECU and the Government to better involve private sector mining
companies in the remediation of “old? and prevention of “new? environmental impacts of mining,
which did not materialize; and (iii) a call for a “radical action plan? to strengthen and restructure
MSD, which was prepared but not implemented. The realization of (ii) presented an ongoing
challenge, as documented in multiple ISRs. While (iii) was essential for the effective enforcement
of the mining industries’ compliance with environmental regulations, it was unrealistic to achieve
during the latter half of the project’s implementation.

35.      Implementation arrangements. During MTR, it was agreed that Project oversight would
be transferred to the Ministry of Mines and Minerals Development (MMMD), in line with the
Government’s decision that projects be assigned to ministries by thematic area. The Project
Implementation Manual was revised accordingly, but for unknown reasons the change did not
materialize and was thus not reflected in the November 2009 DFA Amendment.52 In addition, the
team proposed the incorporation of simplified procurement procedures to facilitate community
participation in project implementation which also did not occur since the Community Grant
Component did not materialize (see paragraph 31).

36.      Project Risk status. At various times, the Project carried two risk flags, i.e., a country
record flag and a disbursement delay flag due to slow disbursement,53 caused by a combination of
the following:
         (i) Delayed amendment to the credit agreement, which was to remedy the over-
exhaustion of some disbursement categories by aligning them with the Project’s actual cost
profile. At one time, almost 65 percent of the Special Account was tied up in expenditures that
had been incurred but could not be claimed from the Bank because the ceilings of the respective
expenditure categories had been exceeded, and a reallocation of funds was required before the
Bank could pay the claimed amounts;
         (ii) Lag on granting of “no objections? on the part of the Bank’s team. Attempts to clear
the backlog of no objections, which were delayed by anywhere between 1-12 months were made
during several missions between May 2009 and December 2009, with mixed results; and
         (iii) Persistent financial management and disbursement problems on the part of the EMF
team. Repeated attempts were made by the Bank’s Project team to resolve these problems, largely
attributable to a substantial amount of ineligible expenditures, i.e. funds advanced to ZECU, the
implementing agency, that were not accounted for vis-à-vis the EMF Secretariat, that created a
backlog of outstanding payments and outstanding claims in various withdrawal applications. As
noted in the December 2007 ISR, a large number of items on disbursement applications was
repeatedly rejected by the Bank’s Disbursement Department due to inadequate documentation
and as a result of contracts that were subject to the Bank's prior review not being posted to SAP.
The reconciliation of the Special Accounts (including reconciliation of funds from the EMF to
ZECU) and reclaiming of all the rejected expenditures had not been completely resolved by the

52
   The revised Volume 1 of the PIM further reflected the introduction of a Community Development Small
Grant category and of a specific MSF program.
53
   The slow rate of disbursements remained a concern throughout the Project: more than 75 percent of
project funds remained undisbursed two years prior to the original closing date and only half of the credit
was disbursed six months before the original closing date.

                                                    13
end of the disbursement grace period. At the time of writing of this ICR, about US$ 0.58 million
in Designated Account balances still did not have the required justification and documentation for
disbursement against IDA Special Accounts.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

37.      M&E framework. The Project’s M&E design was typical of this generation of pre-
Results Framework projects, as both objectives and indicators were largely not Specific,
Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound (SMART). The Country Director expressed
“concerns about the weak M&E framework54 and requested that the Project team work closely
with the Africa Region’s quality control team“ to ensure that a well-designed and monitorable
M&E system [was] in place?. However, the Project file does not contain any evidence of such
consultations, and the M&E framework was not changed. The M&E system comprised few
numeric targets, such as the Output indicator “Zero leakage of tailings dams rehabilitated by the
project,? which in the end was found to be immeasurable.55 The success of subprojects aimed at
cleaning up mining sites, rehabilitating tailings dams, and dredging rivers or canals, etc. was to be
measured in a dichotomous fashion, as opposed to the percentage of works successfully
completed (and sustained). Physical works were rated either as “completed or ongoing.? This
rating system was more focused on engineering outputs than outcomes. It did not take into
account that, in several instances, some of the successes were short lived, as some of the Project
benefits of “completed? subprojects had been partially undone by the end of the Project.56

38.     Other PDO indicators, such as “Pollution flows and loads resulting from mining
operations are regularly monitored? were more focused on process (monitoring) than outcome
(compliance with environmental standards). PDO indicators, however, such as “Consolidated
EMP completed by ZCCM-IH, approved by ECZ and adopted by the Steering Committee? were
more outcome-focused. Key Performance Indicators did not intend to measure the public health
impact of the Project. While the reduction in blood lead levels in children that received treatment
under the Project and changes in water quality were tracked during Project implementation, these
were not formal Outcome or Output indicators. Changes in air and soil contamination, which

54
   It was noted that ?[t]he Project was an early recipient of IDA grants on the condition that there would be
clear indicators of project performance and impact related to leakage level of tailings, reduction of
pollution flow from project rehabilitated sites into the Kafuwe, etc.? While the indicators existed, the
reduction in pollution flow was not measured, given that the Bank team considered it impossible to
distinguish between flows from historical liabilities and active operations; (ii) and the “zero leakage from
rehabilitated tailings dams? indicator could not be measured, given that the dams were not rehabilitated
towards closure, as planned, under the Project.
55
   A member of the Project preparation team remarked that, at the time of Project preparation, mining
companies were not being held responsible for environmental damage caused by their operations, and
considered it less costly to pay fines than to adopt pollution-reduction measures. The Project preparation
team would have therefore considered it inappropriate to include arbitrary pollution reduction targets as
KPIs at appraisal. Instead, the designers intended to invoke better compliance in the mining sector through
strengthening ECZ’s regulatory power, which the Project succeeded in doing.
56
    The benefits of dredging and removing lead-contaminated materials from the Kabwe canal were
significantly diminished by the Municipal Council’s subsequent dredging and failure to remove lead-
contaminated materials from the banks of the canal, as well as the lack of maintenance which caused re-
vegetation and renewed obstruction in the water flow. In other words, even though the subproject was
“completed? in terms of the scope of works performed, its benefits were partially undone shortly thereafter.
In addition, due to vandalism, the equipment in 9 out of 11 play parks intended to prevent children from
playing in lead-contaminated dust were vandalized and scavenged, even though these sub-projects were
considered successfully completed by ZECU, the implementation agency for Component 1.

                                                    14
would have allowed an end-of-Project comparison with assumptions made by the ex ante Cost –
Benefit-Analysis of the Project, were not monitored during implementation.

39. M&E of Component 2 activities. While the EMF Secretariat was responsible for
monitoring overall progress under Component 1 -- i.e., implementation progress made under the
EMF activities implemented by ZECU -- the ECZ Board was responsible for ensuring that overall
progress under Component 2 was monitored periodically by independent parties.57 The findings
of the consultants’ backstopping missions and performance reviews were more descriptive than
analytical and more output-oriented than outcome-focused. While the 2006 report lists the main
issues identified during ECZ’s inspections of mining facilities, it does not offer information as to
the extent and impact of these infractions, whether they were resolved (and if so how), and
whether any fines and other penalties were imposed and to what effect. Due to the split of Project
oversight responsibilities between the EMF Steering Committee and the ECZ Board, the findings
of these performance reviews were not adequately addressed by the Bank’s team, which was to
supervise the Component on behalf of the NDF. This was most likely due to the fact that the
supervision team did not include an Institutional Development or Public Sector Governance
Specialist.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

40. Safeguards implementation. Throughout Project implementation, safeguards
implementation was consistently rated Satisfactory. The Government prepared a comprehensive
Environment and Resettlement Framework that spelled out requirements to comply with World
Bank safeguards, as well as national regulations. Early on in the Project’s life, the slow
preparation of Environmental Project Briefs (EPBs) adversely affected the pace of subproject
preparation. To overcome this hurdle, consultants were contracted in early 2006 to assist ZECU
staff with the preparation of EPBs, which resulted in a substantial improvement in both the speed
and quality of the EPBs. Based on this positive experience, ZECU continued to contract out the
preparation and quality assurance of most EPBs and other safeguard documents. To ensure
subproject compliance with Bank safeguards requirements, with the assistance of an international
safeguards consultant, ZECU put in place a methodology for screening subproject proposals for
potential environmental and social impacts. The screening tool, which was also used by the EMF
Steering Committee in their subproject review and approval process, was consistent with the
provisions of the Project’s Environment and Resettlement Framework.58

41.      Financial Management was rated Satisfactory during the first part of the Project but
downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory for the one-year period between June 2007 and June
2008. The rating was upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory in June 2008 and downgraded again to
Moderately Unsatisfactory in June 2010, which was also the rating assigned in the Project’s last
ISR. One of the main reasons for the first downgrading was the delayed submission of quarterly
reports and the auditors’ management letters. The EMF Secretariat’s internal control environment
was inadequate, given both the insufficient segregation of duties, shortcomings in the internal
audit function, and the failure to reconcile reported financial statement figures with the Bank’s
Disbursement Department. The agreed-upon remedial actions were implemented, albeit to a
limited extent and in an untimely fashion, but nevertheless the financial management

   An international consultant provided technical backstopping in 2005 and 2006 to perform assessments,
monitoring and evaluation of ECZ’s activities. From 2007-2010, a consulting firm was recruited to
undertake annual performance reviews.
58
   Furthermore, the Bank’s Project team facilitated a cooperation arrangement between ZECU and the US
EPA to fully integrate safeguards into ZECU functions and to strengthen capacity.

                                                  15
arrangements were working reasonably well until August 2009. The second downgrading
occurred when the accounting software package, which had been installed in August 2004, was
not operational between August 2009 and February 2010, following a server crash, and causing
data loss. Reverting to a manual - Excel spreadsheet - accounting system was susceptible to errors
and manipulation. It also adversely affected the timely submission of quarterly interim financial
reports and audited financial statements. The auditors expressed unqualified audit opinions but
raised several accountability issues59 in their reports to Management. The EMF Secretariat and
ZECU failed to address the auditors’ recommendations in a timely fashion, and the Government
was requested to refund to the Bank all remaining ineligible expenditures.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

42.     Follow-on operation. Stakeholders consulted during the ICR mission, including the
Government, private mining companies, academic institutions, civil society and beneficiary
communities, agreed without exception that the Project resulted in tangible improvements in
people’s health-related quality of life, notably due to reduced exposure to harmful substances,
such as lead, PBCs, and uranium. Despite its implementation challenges and steep learning curve,
stakeholders recognized the Project, which was the first of its kind in Zambia, as an important
vehicle for addressing mining-related environmental liabilities. In light of the important remedial
work remaining to be done in the Copperbelt and Kabwe, and the need for mining communities to
partake in the profits generated by the mining industry, they strongly emphasized the need for a
follow-on operation. Earlier this year, the Zambian MFNP submitted a formal request for a
follow-on Project to the Bank.60 The main objectives of a successor Project would be to support
the Government in: (i) the remediation of mining-related environmental liabilities and obligations
in affected communities in the Copperbelt and Kabwe through a demand-driven approach; and
(ii) the implementation of the new Environmental Management Law through community
involvement in monitoring mining companies’ compliance with environmental regulations.

43.     The first part of the proposed PDOs for the possible follow-on operation aims to involve
the Government, ZCCM-IH, and the mining companies in co-financing a “Social Responsibility
Fund?61 that would enable communities living adjacent to mines and mineral processing plants to
be proactively involved in the design and implementation of small-scale investments in social and
economic infrastructure that would contribute to better environmental conditions.

44.    The second part of the proposed PDO intends to strengthen social accountability by
engaging mining-affected communities in measuring water, air and soil quality. The Bank’s

59
   Some of the accountability issues raised by the auditors pertained to ineligible expenditures as a result of,
for example, advancing funds between the different Project accounts for Grant and the Credit proceeds,
which is not permitted according to the DFA (Article II, Section 2.02.); salary increases for EMF Project
staff without proper internal authorizations; and ineligible expenditures and honoraria, which affected the
flow of funds to the EMF because the Bank was unable to reimburse the expenditures; and lapses in the
operation of internal controls.
60
   See February 22, 2011 letter from the Zambian Secretary to the Treasury to the Bank’s Country Manager
61
    Due to the magnitude and severity of the environmental liabilities and obligations in the Copperbelt and
Kabwe, some of which were only revealed by in-depth studies undertaken during Project implementation,
the first Project was only able to address a portion of the adverse legacy of 70 years of uncontrolled mining
activities. The proposed follow-on Project would leverage funds to be provided by ZCCM-IH, the
Government, mining companies and possibly development partners to finance priority activities in terms of
their risk to human health. This could include the rehabilitation of the 13 dams that were not closed, as
planned, during the first Project’s lifetime, if they end up reverting back to the Government. The total cost
of rehabilitation and post-closure maintenance is estimated to be about US$39.2 million.

                                                      16
comparative advantage in supporting these activities lies in its international experience in
facilitating governance, both on the demand side, by strengthening the environmental
management capacity of community-based entities, such as Resident Development Committees,
and NGOs, and on the supply side, by supporting the Government in providing an enabling
environment to jointly improve governance and compliance in the mining sector which instills
trust in local authorities and the Government.62

45.      Timing of the follow-on project and transitional arrangements. Stakeholders
emphasized the urgent need to commence the preparation of a follow-on project in order to
sustain and expand the Project’s positive public community health benefits, especially in Kabwe.
ZCCM-IH allocated US$2.13 million (about ZMK 10.5 billion) of its own resources to finance
the maintenance of human resources and systems put in place under the Project, and the
continuation of select Project activities, such as lead treatment in Kabwe, maintenance of two
tailings dams and disposal of redundant chemicals, between the closing of the Project on March
31, 2011 and the expiration of the disbursement grace period on July 31, 2011. ZCCM-IH’s
Board approved funding of US$3.1 million (ZMK 15.2) for the period between August 1, 2011
and March 31, 2012. Considering the profitability of the mining sector at current commodity
price levels, the World Bank expects future IDA financing to leverage a significant counterpart
contribution from the Government’s as well as mining companies’ growing mining revenues.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

46. Relevance of objectives and design. The Project’s objectives, i.e., remedying past and
preventing future environmental liabilities and obligations related to mining operations, remain
highly relevant, as well as the premise that environmental sustainability is a prerequisite to both a
prospering mining sector and a flourishing national economy. The relevance of the Project’s
design reflects generally proper diagnosis at the time of appraisal, as well as consistency with
both the Project’s stated objectives and Zambia’s development priorities during the Project’s
lifetime, as evidenced by the facts that:

x    Sound economic management, and in particular remedying mining-related water and air
     pollution, was one of the Development Objectives in the 2000-2003 CAS. The Project was
     regarded as the Bank’s key lending instrument for supporting the Government in carrying out
     environmental mitigation measures in mining areas, in pursuit of sound environmental
     management (2000-2003 CAS).
x    The mining sector’s compliance with environmental regulations represented one of the
     Outcome Indicators which the 2004-2007 CAS aimed to influence and which were aligned
     with Strategic Priority 1, i.e., sustained economic growth anchored in a diversified and
     export-oriented economy (2004-2007 CAS, pg. 16).
x    Increasing the percentage of mining companies in compliance with the EMPs for the
     identified priority environmental liabilities from 35 percent in 2005 to 85 percent in 2010 was

62
   This Component could further include support to the Government in operationalizing and enforcing the
2011 Environmental Management Act. The timing for the preparation of a new Project is opportune, given
that, over the next three years, the Ministry of Environment will have to prepare a National Environmental
Action Plan (NEAP), which shall, among other things, outline a strategy and schedule for the
implementation of the necessary actions “to prevent, eliminate and reduce adverse effects as described in
the most recent State of the Environment Report? (ECZ (2011). Environmental Management Act No. 12 of
2011, Paragraph 21.2.).

                                                   17
     one of the key outcomes of the Bank’s 2008-2011 CAS that the Bank expected to influence
     through its interventions (CAS Progress Report, 2011). The actual achievement in 2010 was
     60 percent compliance.
x    The mining sector, which has accounted for about 15-18 percent of GDP and 80 percent of
     export earnings in recent years,63 remains the main contributor to Zambia’s economic growth.
     In order to maximize the sector’s economic benefits and to realize its potentially high
     contribution to poverty reduction, ensuring sustainable production and management by
     mitigating the adverse environmental impacts of mining is crucial (Zambia’s Sixth National
     Development Plan for 2011-2015).

47.      Effectiveness of implementation arrangements. According to various stakeholders
consulted during the ICR mission, overall, the oversight of EMF activities by the EMF-Steering
Committee worked well. Based on a screening checklist, the Steering Committee, with the
assistance of an Independent Advisory Team (IAT) successfully reviewed and approved about 60
percent of all submitted subproject proposals. However, several members of the Steering
Committee noted that its effectiveness was compromised by the discontinuity in the chairmanship
of its meetings64 as well as the perception that MFNP did not always honor decisions made by the
Committee, thereby reportedly undermining its effectiveness as the EMF Secretariat’s oversight
body.65 Unlike the EMF Steering Committee, the Interagency Regulatory Committee established
by the ECZ to coordinate contributions from delegated authorizing agencies, did not function
effectively. Its meetings took place less frequently than the anticipated quarterly schedule, and it
reportedly needs to be reorganized (Komex, ECZ Performance Report, 2009).

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objective

48.     The purpose of this section is to: (i) assess the Project’s achievement of its higher-level
objective, as measured by its contribution to ensuring environmentally sustainable economic
development; (ii) measure the Project’s achievement of its objectives against the Outcome
Indicators, as stated in the DFA; and (iii) evaluate the Project’s outcomes by Project Component.

49.     Achievement of Higher-Level Objective. The Project’s higher-level objective was to
support the Government in removing constraints to private investments in mining assets, which
was considered critical to economic growth. As mentioned above, ZCCM’s adverse
environmental legacy was a key issue during negotiations with private investors who were
unwilling to accept legal responsibility for the enormous historical environmental liabilities. The
Project achieved the following outcomes with regard to this higher-level objective:

x    Reassurance of investors. The Project provided the necessary funding to assure investors that
     ZCCM-IH and the Government would not default on their environmental mitigation
     obligations,66 which would have led certain investors, such as Konkola Copper Mines
     (KCM), to pull out. The Project was thus instrumental to the completion of the privatization

63
   See World Bank (2011). Zambia. What would it Take for Zambia’s Copper Mining Industry to achieve
its Potential? Report No. 62378-ZM, pg. 14f.
64
   The Secretary to the Treasury reportedly delegated the chairmanship of the Steering Committee meetings
on a regular and rotational basis.
65
   In addition, in light of the protracted difficulties in accounting for funding, ineligible expenses, special
account replenishment, the effectiveness of the EMF Secretariat was certainly limited.
66
   It is important to recognize that, during privatization negotiations with private investors, ZCCM-IH and
the Government had agreed to retain responsibility for a wide range of environmental liabilities, which
were not passed on to the new mine investors.

                                                     18
     process. In addition to facilitating the preparation of EMPs for each privatized mining
     operation, the Project further led the Government to adopt a “bigger picture? approach to
     addressing mining-related environmental liabilities. The CEMP identified and prioritized
     remedial actions for implementation during the Project’s life and beyond.

x    Macro level impact. The Project succeeded in achieving one of its main purposes, namely to
     remove barriers to investment. Two success stories stand out in this regard. The rehabilitation
     of two sites, i.e., the Kansanshi mine near Sowezi and the defunct high-grade leach plant in
     Nchanga, paved the way for the subsequent development of these sites by investors at a total
     cost of about US$245 million. These investments, which would not have occurred without the
     Project, far exceeded the cleanup cost of about US$2.9 million,67 and the total Project cost.
     Furthermore, mining companies have invested in new technologies that allow second-
     generation copper mining, as well as third generation smelting of copper. The successfully
     privatized mining sector has remained the major contributor to Zambia’s economic growth,
     and its fiscal impact is significant. Annually, the Government collects about US$360 million
     in royalties from mining companies (Project staff calculations), in addition to profit taxes. In
     addition, ZCCM-IH retained 10-20 percent equity interest in the newly privatized mining
     companies.

x    Improved environmental governance due to strong NGO involvement. Apart from reassuring
     private investors that ZCCM-IH and the Government would honor their contractual
     environmental mitigation obligations, the Project managed to engage NGOs, who had strong
     reservations against the privatization of the mining industry due to the perceived lack of
     regard for environmental and socio-economic impacts on the majority of Zambians living
     below the poverty line,68as constructive partners.69 Furthermore, as a result of several NGOs’
     advocacy and social accountability efforts, important interventions, such as the lead
     remediation works in Kabwe were included in the Project’s scope, which had initially been
     limited to the mitigation of mining-related environmental impacts in the Copperbelt area, at
     the urging of the Blacksmith Institute.70 NGOs also provided additional oversight during
     Project implementation by monitoring implementation progress, in close collaboration with
     the ZECU and Bank teams.



67
   Given the need for rapid mobilization of financing, the Government decided to utilize surplus funding
ZCCM-IH's Labor Reduction Program (LRP) that had been established under the Public Sector Reform and
Export Promotion Adjustment Credit (PSREP).
68
   In their 2000 Report, Citizens for a Better Environment (CBE), Oxfam, Rights and Accountability in
Development Refugee Studies Centre (RAID), the Inter-African Network for Human Rights &
Development (Afronet) argued that the privatization of the mining industry had created conditions in which
the majority of poor Zambians were denied their fundamental human rights, particularly due to the lack of
regard for negative socio-economic impacts of involuntary or uncompensated resettlement.
69
   Several NGOs even lodged a formal complaint against the Anglo American Corporation, a significant
minority shareholder represented on the ZCCM board, with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) in
London for failing to bear the degree of responsibility for past failures in environmental management, such
as exceeding standards for sulfur emissions and effluents (see RAID, Afronet (2002).
70
   In addition, 65 families facing involuntary displacement from a mine subsidence area in Mufulira were
successfully resettled under the Project at the urging of Citizens for a Better Environment (see
www.cbezambia.org); and partly due to NGO pressure, the Konkola Copper Mine (KCM) made the
mobilization of its funds to develop the Konkola Deep Mining Project contingent on the resettlement of 20
families from this site. The resettlement was implemented, as a priority action, during Project preparation,
financed from the proceeds of the Labor Reduction Program.

                                                    19
50.     Achievement of Project Outcomes. Despite significant challenges faced during
implementation, the Project managed to accomplish its objectives, albeit with moderate
shortcomings in timeliness and scope of its outcomes. It’s most significant overall achievement,
detailed below, is the fact that it led the Government to adopt a longer-term, systematic, and risk
based approach to environmental management planning.

PDO (i) addressing environmental liabilities and obligations associated with the mining sector,
following the privatization of the mining assets of ZCCM;

51.      A total of 15 Investor and 12 Counterpart Environmental Management Plans (EMPs)
were created, defining ZCCM-IH’s, the Government’s, and private investors’ remediation
responsibilities for each mining operation. These successfully negotiated and ECZ-approved
EMPs marked the starting point for tackling the adverse environmental legacy and provided a
baseline for the management and regulation of environmental and social issues (Aide Memoire,
MTR). These long-term EMPs are being implemented for the duration of the mining sector
investment operations. Their implementation is being monitored by ECZ for the whole mining
sector. The mining companies’ compliance with provisions of the EMPs has increased from 35%
in 2005 to 60% in 2010.

52.     The completion, disclosure71 and approval by ECZ of the CEMP 2, i.e. the final CEMP
represented a significant milestone in the mitigation and prevention of mining related adverse
environmental impacts. It ensured the concurrence between the Investor and Counterpart EMPs in
the larger context of concerns about public health and ecosystem functioning downstream from
mining operations.

53.      The subprojects implemented under the Project were selected in accordance with
environmental obligations identified and classified as high priority interventions in the CEMP 2.
As noted by ECZ, the CEMP should be updated as soon as possible to reflect recent changes in
accountability due to changing ownership of mining rights. The priorities identified for EMF
funding during Project appraisal (PAD) were rather similar to the ones identified by the CEMP.
The scope of lead remediation activities, however, had been underestimated and was only
revealed during the Kabwe Design and Scoping Study, which took an in-depth look at pathways
and impacts of lead contamination at household level. The Project’s environmental cleanup
activities achieved the following tangible positive impacts on people’s health and livelihoods in
the Copperbelt province and Kabwe.

x    Successful resettlement of residents from unsafe mine caving areas. A total of 175 families
     previously living in unsafe housing due to land subsidence as a result of underground mining
     activities were resettled to new permanent homes in the Copperbelt area. The families
     reported great satisfaction with their new residences, and ZECU has been commended on this
     successful intervention, including its meaningful involvement of communities in decision-
     making by stakeholders including mining companies, NGOs, and development partners.

x    Reduced exposure to health hazards. Exposure to harmful substances was significantly
     reduced through the removal and proper disposal of hazardous materials from mine sites,
     such as 150,000 cubic meters of radioactive uranium tailings, about 220 tons of PCBs, and
     56,000 m3 of lead contaminated soils in Copperbelt and Kabwe, as well as extensive

71
  In addition to disclosing the CEMP in public places, town summaries were produced in local languages
and were publicized in local media. Furthermore, disclosure meetings, attended by a total of 634 concerned
residents, were held in three Copperbelt towns (CEP News, Issue 3, Jan-March 2007).

                                                   20
       demolition, cleanup and re-vegetation efforts. In addition, four tailings dams and two
       overburden dumps were repaired and their potential health and environmental risks reduced.72
       However, the fact that the permanent closure of 13 tailings dams did not occur as planned due
       to their potential reprocessing represents a shortfall in anticipated Project outcomes.

x      Healthier children as a result of lead treatment. In Kabwe, one of the World’s most polluted
       towns, the Project contributed significantly to the remediation of lead contamination caused
       by ZCCM’s historic mining activities.73 Based on the Kabwe Scoping and Design Study,
       which identified the nature, extent and pathways of contamination, and recommended
       actions, the Project financed a well-designed, comprehensive set of interlinked activities to
       reduce the - by international standards - exceptionally high blood lead levels74 in children
       living in the vicinity of the smelter. The Project supported a state-of-the-art Integrated Case
       Management (ICM) program, which provided specialized care through by a multidisciplinary
       team comprising a physician, nurse, sociologist, community volunteers,75 environmental
       technical specialist and caregivers. As shown in Graphs 1 and 2 below, this program resulted
       in a reduction of blood lead levels in 2,822 children (out of 5,000 children tested) by between
       20-25 percent in the case of treatment with nutritional supplements (for children with blood
       lead levels between 20-64 micrograms per deciliter) and by up to 74 percent for chelation
       treatment (for children with blood lead levels beyond 65 micrograms per deciliter).

72
   For example, the stabilization of Tailings Dam 33C prevented a recurrence of the dam breaches that had
occurred in 1997, releasing about 1 million tons of tailings into a stream, damaging traditional farmlands.
73
   About 50,000 people were severely affected by lead-contaminated air, soil and vegetation stemming from
a smelter that operated in the center of town until the mine’s closing in 1994.
74
   Records show average levels of lead in children of between 60 and 120 mcg/dl. The WHO considers
levels over 10 unhealthy, and levels exceeding 120 are usually lethal (BBC News, 2003).
75
   Community volunteers essentially played the role of social workers, who, in exchange for food,
identified children for testing, provided follow-up, monitored and encouraged treatment adherence.


                                                    21

efforts to prevent recontamination of treated children and contamination of newly born children.

55.     Livelihood support. The use of local manual labor during the dredging of the Luanshya
River78 to improve both water flow and water quality provided a temporary income opportunity
for nearby residents. Under this safety-net like, labor intensive-public works subproject, a total of
170 community laborers were employed for four weeks at a rate of ZMK10,000 or about US$2
per day. The total wage payment amounted to ZMK47,600,000 (US$10,000) or about US$59 per
participant. Other examples of livelihood support include the provision, on a pilot basis, of basic
business management training and in-kind seed capital (in the form of a hammer mill, a pressure
water pump and start-up capital for a chicken run) to three income-generating groups of women,

76
   The spike in Cholera cases in 2008 was due to flooding caused by excessive rainfall.
77
   However, children are now playing at these centers, which is preferable to playing in the dust.
78
   About 40 percent of the tailings from upstream mining activities were dredged from the banks of the
Luanshya River. This has reduced flooding of farmlands and communities downstream, as well as
diminished the risk to the physical integrity of the Akatiti and Chonga tailings dams.

                                                     22
each comprising about 25 members. These alternative income opportunities enabled the women
to supplement family incomes in healthier ways compared to scavenging tailings dams for scrap
metal. Livelihood support was further provided to the 175 families resettled under the Project.79

56.       All contractual obligations were addressed80. Priority liabilities were addressed to
varying extent. While in Kabwe most of the priority liabilities identified by the Kabwe Scoping
and Design Study were tackled by the Project, priority liabilities identified by the CEMP in the
Copperbelt were addressed to a significantly lesser extent, given that the 13 tailings dams,
earmarked for closure under the Project, could not be rehabilitated, as planned. As mentioned
above, following the increase in copper prices, the mining rights for these dams, along with the
liabilities associated with them, were transferred to the private sector by MMMD for reprocessing
of residual copper content.

PDO (ii) strengthening the capacity of its environmental regulatory institutions to improve
future-compliance of the mining sector with environmental and social regulations.

57.       One of the key intentions of Component 2 of the Project was to change the power balance
between ECZ and the mining companies by strengthening the agency’s capacity to actively
participate in the negotiation of privatization contracts with new investors, and to monitor and
enforce their compliance with contractual environmental obligations and environmental
standards. The Component was visionary as it complemented the remediation of the adverse
mining-related environmental legacy, financed from the EMF under Component 1 of the Project,
with capacity building of Zambia’s environmental regulatory agency in order to avoid future
liabilities. ECZ has become stronger, as evidenced by the fact that it is using litigation to enforce
compliance, and, on two occasions, it temporarily shut down specific polluting mining facilities81
until an identified problem was rectified or a schedule of remedial measures agreed-upon.

58.      A second intended outcome was for ECZ to play the role of a “dispatcher? to mobilize
specialized delegated agencies, such as MSD. This arrangement resulted in a strengthened
relationship and revised MoU between ECZ and MSD, thus more effectively integrating
environmental concerns into the “Terms of Reference? of the delegated agencies. While formal
efforts aimed at strengthening ECZ’s and the MSD’s monitoring and enforcement capacity
resulted in less tangible outcomes, particularly in the case of MSD, due to implementation delays
under this Component, the review and monitoring of the implementation of the EMPs, EIAs, and
the CEMP had a positive “learning by doing? effect as reported by staff of the institutions to the
ICR mission.

59.     ZCCM-IH established and is operating a monitoring system. ECZ established a
monitoring program and has been monitoring the EMPs’ compliance with statutory limits,
primarily based on compliance reports from mine operators. Between 2005 and 2010, ECZ
conducted, on average, 90 visits to 23 mine areas (i.e. business units or facilities) per year to

79
   It was noted, though, that community consultation could have been better in regard to people’s choices of
livelihoods. Resettled families had been assigned farming plots under the somewhat erroneous assumption
that they would take up farming. However, due to the convenient location of the new settlement, families
were able to pursue alternative livelihoods.
80
     At the recommendation of an independent advisor a dredging subcomponent planned was not
implemented given that 90% of the pollution problem to be addressed was the result of continued pollution
by an upstream mining company.
81
   These were business units or facilities of Konkola Copper Mines and Ndola Lime for suspected water
and air pollution, respectively (information provided by ECZ).

                                                    23
countercheck the reported data. However, due to the delay in the procurement of NDF-financed
monitoring equipment by ECZ, the monitoring program was not fully implemented, and the
collection of monitoring data has, therefore, been very limited to date.

60.     Based on ECZ’s efforts to monitor and enforce, through fines, temporary suspensions of
mining licenses and litigation, private mining operators’ compliance with environmental
regulations, the industry’s compliance with EMPs is, on average, presently about 60 percent
(CAS Progress Report, April 2011) against a target of 85% and a baseline of 35% in 2005. This is
partly due to the fact that, during privatization, the Government exempted various new investors
from having to comply with environmental standards to give them time to phase out or retrofit the
old technology they inherited.

61.      ECZ monitored pollution flows and loads periodically, based both on pollution data
submitted by the mining companies, its own sampling at discharge points to verify data reported
by the mining companies, and at sampling of ambient water quality at fixed sampling points
throughout the Copperbelt. ECZ carried out water quality monitoring of the Kafue River. Some of
the samples were collected by designated agencies such as ZECU and the Department of Water
Affairs. The water quality data suggest that Project activities did not lead to a significant
improvement in water quality (see Annex 2). However, the fact that the water quality did not
deteriorate in spite of a more than 100 percent increase in copper production between 2003 and
2010 from 300,000 to 700,000 tons per year is attributable to more vigorous compliance
enforcement efforts on the part of ECZ, as a result of Project support. While no spillage occurred
following Project interventions at the dams that were maintained (5) or repaired (2) under the
Project, little preventive maintenance was carried out at the recently privatized tailings dams that
were initially earmarked for closure under the Project. Their current contribution to the pollution
flows into streams flowing out of the mine areas is unknown.

3.3 Efficiency

62. According to the ex ante Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA), the mitigation measures to be
carried out by the EMF, coupled with enhanced regulatory oversight by ECZ, were expected to
generate benefits in the form of lower soil contamination, water pollution and air pollution levels
as well as a reduction in the likelihood of a tailings dam failure. The results of the ex post CBA
analysis (see Annex 3) indicates an Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of 10 percent, which is about
60 percent of the ERR projected at Project appraisal.

63. The benefits generated under the Project from reduced soil contamination in Kabwe were
substantial, albeit lower than anticipated; the Project benefits in the form of water and air
pollution prevented from occurring as a result of the Project were lower than anticipated, as were
benefits from the reduced likelihood of tailings dam failures. The latter is attributable to the fact
that the planned rehabilitation of 13 tailings dams for closure was not implemented under the
Project (see paragraph 15).

64. While the ex post CBA, based on the methodology used to calculate the ex ante CBA at
Project appraisal, represents an important measure of efficiency, the Economic Rate of Return,
which assesses the opportunity cost of Project investments, only tells part of the story. At the time
of appraisal an ex ante Financial Rate of Return, which would have measured the financial return
in relation to Project investments, was not calculated. It is important to note that, contrary to an
anticipated limited (negative) impact (PAD, pg. 24) Project investments actually generated a
dramatic positive fiscal impact.


                                                 24
65. As a result of the US$1.5 million investment in the cleanup of the Kansanshi Mine (in
Solwezi), funded during Project preparation from the Labor Reduction Fund (see paragraph 24), a
private mining company invested US$125 million in the construction a new plant, which would
not have occurred without the Project. Since then, the mine has expanded substantially, which
has led to a considerable appreciation in the value of the 20 percent share in the Kansanshi Mine
retained by ZCCM-IH during its privatization. The mine’s present value is estimated at about
US$10 billion, and the company is planning to build a US$500 million new smelter in the near
future. Until 2010, most tax revenues collected from mining in Zambia came from Kansanshi; in
2009 Kansanshi paid US$265 million in taxes, and between 2006 and 2010 it paid over US$1
billion in taxes. This amount does not include the recently announced US$224 million in super
profits tax, which the company agreed to pay (information received from World Bank’s Mining
Department). A similar success story is the case of the Nchanga High Grade Tailings Leach Plant
where the demolition and site cleanup, at a cost of US$1.4 million, also funded during Project
preparation from LRF proceeds, paved the ground for a new US$120 million smelter and Acid
Plant financed by a private investor.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

66.       The achievement of the PDOs – which, as confirmed by stakeholders during the ICR
mission, continue to be highly relevant – was moderately satisfactory. Even though the overall
environmental liabilities from historic mining activities were not completely addressed, or were
not addressed in a fully sustainable fashion, the Project achieved its key performance indicators’
targets82, and successfully put in place the “blue print? (through CEMP2) for addressing adverse
mining-induced environmental problems according to a risk-based methodology. In other words,
in addition to addressing a significant portion of the priority physical historical liabilities, the fact
that the Project developed a comprehensive approach for tackling ZCCM’s environmental
liabilities rather than dealing with them in a piecemeal fashion, was a significant contribution.
Similarly significant was the excellent integrated approach to reducing elevated blood lead levels
in children affected by lead contamination in Kabwe. While the Project’s achievement of its
PDOs was less than fully satisfactory, it is noteworthy that the Project was very successful in
achieving its higher-level objective, i.e. to contribute to the revitalization of the copper industry.
The Project was instrumental to the successful privatization of the mining industry, and it
generated a remarkable positive fiscal impact.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

67.    Knowledge, attitude and behavior change. The Project amplified the importance of
environmental protection in the mining sector, and significantly enhanced the awareness of
environmental risks and prevention among mining communities in the Copperbelt and Kabwe. 83
The community outreach activities were a remarkable success, given that the Project team


82
   The achievements of indicators’ targets is summarized in the ICR Datasheet and supported by details in
Annex 2.
83
   A risk communication strategy was developed and implemented in Kabwe at household level, in close
collaboration with the Kabwe Municipal Council, the Kabwe Lead Management Committee and
community leaders. A comprehensive Knowledge, Attitudes, Practices and Beliefs (KAPB) baseline survey
was undertaken. The follow up survey was not carried out due to shortage of (uncommitted) funds. The
Kabwe Scoping and Design Study (KDSD) assessed the extent and magnitude of lead contamination,
pathways of lead exposure to humans, and consulted with communities on proposed mitigation measures.

                                                   25
managed to build trust and overcome obstacles deeply rooted in cultural beliefs.84 In addition, the
Project made environmental information accessible by establishing four Environmental Public
Information Centers (EPICs) in Copperbelt towns and Kabwe and reaching out to communities
through a variety of media, including an excellent newsletter. The outcome was not only
increased awareness but, more importantly, considerable behavior change, especially in the form
of improved personal and household hygiene, made possible by water supply investments under
the Project.

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

68.      Environmental remediation particularly benefited the poor. Poor and vulnerable
population groups, who had been most adversely affected by ZCCM’s environmental liabilities,
benefited the most from the Project.85 It was typically the disadvantaged population groups, in
particular women-headed households, which: (i) lived in unsafe conditions caused by mine
subsidence, lead contamination, and close proximity to radioactive mine waste; (ii) were exposed
to dust emissions, SO2 inhalation, and produce grown on land irrigated with contaminated water
for agriculture; and (iii) faced more health risks associated with flooding or breaches of tailings
dams and accidents while scavenging tailings dumps for scrap metals and ore. As rightly noted by
Bank Management, “if sustained, the environmental remediation works … are an important
building block to improved health of communities in mining areas (see Box 2).? Though not
measured under the Project, it also was an investment in human capital, given that children who
benefited from lead treatment are less likely to suffer lead-induced cognitive impairments86 and
are more likely to perform better academically and professionally.

                 Box 3: Livelihood Support Beneficiary Profile: Judith Kasikila
Judith Kasikila is a 58-year old married mother of 10 children aged 16-38, living in Kabwe’s
Mutwewa Nsofu Township. Judith used to scavenge mine dump sites for scrap metal and metal
ore, which she would sell every day for about ZMK 10,000 to businessmen who would come up
from Lusaka to buy stones and scrap from men and women who, with their bare hands, pick and
shovel, would engage in illegal scavenging of dumps. They put their lives at risk as they inhaled
heavy metal dust and excavated in unsafe areas.
 Judith first learned about the effects of exposure to lead when she attended community meeting
 organized by ZCCM-IH staff. At first, she attended focus group meetings held as part of the
 sensitization campaign and soon she trained to become a community facilitator and peer
 educator herself. She was happy to have benefited from the yard greening as well as the water

69. Environmental liabilities as development opportunities. Given that the “challenges of
poverty are overwhelming, poor living conditions and poor diets frustrate the efforts of the
project and community health workers,? agreement was reached at MTR that a clearer link be
established between socio-economic development and environmental remediation. In line with
the motto “liabilities as development opportunities,? local communities were to be involved in the
maintenance of sites and/or the development of economic activities around such sites.87 One
successful example was the dredging of the Luanshya Rather, which engaged manual labor – as
opposed to heavy machinery - to spread the dredged material along the River.88 However, the
plan to establish a US$1.5 million small community grants scheme to fund small-scale,
community-based livelihood and environmental improvement investments was not implemented
in order to maintain the slowly disbursing Project’s focus on its already ambitious original scope
of work.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

70.      New environmental mitigation and prevention tools. One of the Project’s most
significant accomplishments in this regard was the Project–supported review of Zambian
environmental legislation and subsequent drafting, by ECZ, of the new Environmental
Management Act, which was signed into law in May 2011. The Act contains more stringent
penalties for non-compliance than the previous Environmental Protection and Pollution Control
Act (EPPCA).89 Of similar importance was the support provided by the Project to the
development of EMPs and the CEMP II, which resulted in the creation of a cohesive system of
clearly defined responsibilities regarding the remediation of environmental liabilities at and
downstream of mine sites. As a result of the provision of monitoring equipment and technical
assistance, albeit limited, compliance-monitoring efforts on the part of ECZ and MSD have
intensified, contributing to an improvement in the industry’s compliance from 35 percent in 2005
to 60 percent in 2010 (ECZ data). However, there is room for stricter “supply side? enforcement
through these mandated agencies and “demand side? accountability exercised by civil society.
While the Project managed to significantly improve people’s lead risk awareness, it did not
improve access to environmental data and compliance monitoring reports, which is a crucial
prerequisite to promoting social accountability.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

71.      Improved environmental governance due to strong NGO involvement. As detailed in
paragraph 49, the Project managed very effectively to engage NGOs, some of whom had strong
reservations against the privatization of the mining industry due to its perceived disregard for
environmental and socio-economic impacts. Key project activities, such as lead remediation in
Kabwe, resettlement of 65 families from a mine subsidence area in Mufulira, resettlement of 20
families from the Konkola Deep site, and others were designed and implemented with substantial
input from several NGOs’ advocacy and social accountability efforts.




87
   See June 12, 2006 letter from the Bank’s Country Director to Ministers of MFNP and MMMD.
88
   The deposit of a large volume of mine tailings stemming from upstream mining operations had raised the
riverbed to the extent that it posed a risk to the structural stability of the Akatiti and Chonga tailings dams.
89
   The maximum imposable fine was raised from ZMK 2,700,000 or about US$ 550 (or imprisonment for a
period of up to three years or both) to ZMK 180,000,000 or about US$ 36,000 (or to imprisonment for a
period not exceeding ten years or both). See 2011 Environmental Management Act, Part XI: Environmental
Offences).

                                                      27
72.      Environmental Protection Fund (EPF). As mentioned earlier, the Project financed the
cost of setting up and starting the national Environmental Protection Fund (EPF) (not to be
confused with the Environmental Management Facility (EMF) under Component 1. The former is
a statutory entity established to ensure, through mandatory contributions from mining companies,
that sufficient funds are available to Government to cover cleanup costs in the case of mine
closure or investor pullout. The amount which has been collected to date from 30 mining
companies (US$8 million) is below the projected (and needed) amount; however, the
operationalization of this earmarked clean up funding mechanism is a major institutional
accomplishment that had to overcome significant political and industry resistance.90 The EPF’s
goal is to be financially self-sustaining by 2013, i.e. collect sufficient contributions to be able to
fund all existing mine closure and clean up plans.91 This seems particularly important,
considering that remedial actions that have been suggested for mining companies may not be
commensurate with the risks.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

73.     While beneficiary surveys or end-of-Project stakeholder workshops did not take place,
extensive stakeholder consultations were held during Project preparation, implementation, and
also during the ICR mission. The various stakeholders were very consistent in their assessment of
the Project’s strengths and weaknesses discussed above. A Midterm Review workshop with 62
different stakeholders from local authorities, mining companies, NGOs, faith-based
organizations, media, the Government, ZCCM-IH and others took place in 2006.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

74.     The sustainability of assets and activities supported under the Project is a concern,
particularly if a follow-on project to consolidate the results of the Project does not materialize.
Despite repeated cautioning by Bank Management, insufficient attention was paid by both the
Bank and ZECU teams to ensuring an effective handover of operation and maintenance
responsibilities for assets created under the Project to the designated entities. Potential threats to
the Project’s longer term sustainability are outlined below. They take into account the Project
MoUs with the respective partners:92




90
   EPF contributions are determined by the “cleanliness ratings? assigned by ECZ/MSD based on
environmental audits. The biggest challenge has been the mining companies’ limited compliance with the
requirement to provide a Bank guarantee for the remainder of the anticipated mine closing costs. This
challenge had, as of the drafting of this ICR, not been fully resolved, particularly for large mining houses
reluctant discouraged by the high cost of (large) Bank guarantees.
91
   Intending to achieve this in five years seems overly ambitious and unrealistic. At present, about 30
mining companies contribute to the EPF, and adequate capacity at the level of MSD is crucial (but not yet
in place) to ensure the EPF’s financial viability as the number of mining companies increases. Several
stakeholders consulted during the ICR mission recommended that the mining operators continue to
contribute – and that contributions be increased in light of the current profitability of the mining industry -
after the mandated 5 to 20 percent of closing costs have been paid into the EPF.
92
    In the case of Kabwe, these included line ministries, local authorities, water companies, and
communities. The MoU with the counterparts contained provisions governing end-of-Project handover of
operational and maintenance responsibilities. However, the MoU counterparts seemed to lack a sense of
ownership and commitment to protecting Project-financed investments.92

                                                     28
x    Recontamination of remediated sites due to lack of political will.93 Lack of political will to:
     (i) enforce compliance with environmental regulations; as well as (ii) increase the mining
     companies’ contributions to the EPF could present94 a potentially significant risk to the
     Development Outcome. Failure on the part of MSD and ECZ to reduce adverse
     environmental impacts of ongoing mining could present a threat to the long-term benefits of
     Project interventions. The interface between Government, ZCCM-IH, the private sector and
     communities, which was supposed to facilitate the remediation of active, as well as historical,
     environmental liabilities remained difficult throughout the Project.

x    Privatization of tailings dumps for reprocessing. Even though the reprocessing of tailings
     dams and reopening of the Kabwe mine were found not to be economically viable, these sites
     were privatized by the Ministry of Mines and Minerals (see paragraph 15). This effectively
     prevented ZCCM-IH from implementing the rehabilitation and decommissioning works, in
     accordance with the Project’s original scope of work. ECZ is expected to closely monitor the
     situation to safeguard Project benefits and minimize health risks for nearby communities.95
     However, due to “human and financial resources constraints? Project sites were not inspected
     and monitored by ECZ as regularly as intended (KOMEX, 2009 Component 2 Performance
     Review).

x    Uncertain support to ongoing programs. While ZCCM-IH has agreed to provide temporary
     funding for the continuation of successful programs, such as the Kabwe lead management
     and treatment activities a long-term solution has yet to be found; and it is hoped that a follow-
     on project would provide financing, at least in the medium term. The need to “involve more
     decisively local authorities, including capacity building, to ensure long term sustainability?
     was correctly recognized. Due to its interim nature, this arrangement, while successful in the
     short term, does not ensure sustainability in the longer run.

x    Insufficient community ownership. While the Project entailed extensive lead risk awareness
     activities and other forms of community consultation, it was agreed that a more proactive
     involvement of mining communities would have helped to ensure sustainability, in
     accordance with the Project’s design. The Community Development Small Grants Fund,
     which aimed to enhance community participation through demand-driven investments during
     the second half of the Project’s lifetime, was not established and, as a result, communities
     played more of a consultative than a decision-making role.




93
   For example, there was justifiable concern that: (i) the potentially careless exploitation of the Kabwe
tailings dam would jeopardize Project efforts to control lead contamination in the area; (ii) in 2009, high
levels of waste materials, such as tailings and concentrate from an upstream mining operation, caused the
stream to rise within 30 cm of the base of the bridge over the steam to the Democratic Republic of Congo,
“[calling] into question the environmental benefits of abating problems with the Nchanga overburden
dumps?; Aide Memoires, November 2009 and January 2011 missions); and (iii) emissions from a battery
recycling plant in Kabwe are causing adverse health impacts.
94
   A new Government has been elected in Zambia and the Bank will encourage it to take on the baton with
respect to improving compliance on environmental safeguards.
95
     Bank Management had urged the Project team to “quickly resolve issue of tailings dams that are a
danger to local communities?. No dam failures have occurred since Project implementation as a result of
Project-funded maintenance and repair works, but a viable long-term solution remains to be sought.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

     (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
         Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

75.     Project Design. Bank performance during Project preparation was Moderately
Satisfactory. The Project team was commended by Bank Management for the good preparation of
the first year work programs.96 With the exception of the absence of a Public Sector
Governance/Institutional Development Expert for Component 2, the team’s composition
represented an appropriate skills mix. Project design was innovative, and Project preparation was
thorough and creative.97 In addition to very positive feedback from the Quality at Entry Review
(QER) panel, the Task Team Leader had arranged a “Tiger Team? of senior level Bank staff,
which reviewed preparation milestones and advised the task team. Project preparation
documentation was readily available and detailed, as was the PAD.

76.     However, Bank Management rightly expressed concerns about “the weak M&E
framework? given the failure to track “clear indicators of project performance and impact related
to leakage level of tailings, reduction of pollution flow from project rehabilitated sites into the
Kafue River.? Furthermore, the overly ambitious design of Component 2, the lack of integration
of oversight of Components 1 (by the EMF Steering Committee) and Component 2 activities (by
the ECZ Board) turned out to be shortcomings in Project design. At a thematic level, though, the
linkages between ECZ and EMF seemed well designed, in particular their interface with regard to
the EMPs and CEMP.

        (b) Quality of Supervision
        Rating: Unsatisfactory

77.      Overall quality of implementation support. Positive and successful aspects of Project
supervision were noted, in particular during the first half of the Project. These included: (i)
flexibility by the TTL to adapt to changing circumstances, such as the inclusion in the project
scope of: the removal of uranium tailings, which were only identified during implementation; the
financing of the rehabilitation of the water supply system in Kabwe to enable residents to avoid
lead ingestion through hand washing; and the inclusion of the resettlement of residents in a mine
subsidence area, in response to a need identified through an NGO; (ii) innovation on the part of
the TTL, in the form of supporting the creation and initial operation of the Environment Project
Fund; and (ii) the TTL’s trusted partnership and productive collaboration with NGOs.

78.     Supervision missions were conducted on a fairly regular basis, as reflected in the ISRs.
However, mission documentation, such as Aide Memoires and management letters from six
supervision missions were not readily available in the electronic Project files. The Bank’s
Management also rightly expressed concern about infrequent updating of indicators in ISRs. As
noted in the December 2008 ISR, “presently some of [the indicators] go too far back to give an

96
   As noted in the November 2003 ISR, “the project is now off to a smooth start, with good preparation of
first year work programs. The Task Team should be particularly congratulated for its extremely effective
handling of the potential Kabwe resettlement and insistence on transparent communications with civil
society.“
97
   For example, in order to raise awareness among decision makers of the reputational risk and potential
consequences incurred in a “without Project scenario? the team screened the movie “Erin Brockovich.?

                                                   30
accurate measure of progress.? The quality of ISRs varied. Some were very thorough, detailing
issues and outlining recommended actions, others resembled forward-looking SMOs as opposed9
to documenting actual implementation status. While technical support provided by the Bank team
with regard to mining and environmental issues, in particular, seemed to have been sound and
solid, as evidenced by the Project’s significant achievements particularly in the remediation of
environmental liabilities (see paragraph 51), the Bank’s supervision performance overall was
Unsatisfactory, due to the following shortcomings:98

x    Significant delays in issuing No Objections. Stakeholders consulted during the ICR mission
     attributed a large part of the Project’s slow implementation progress, in particular after MTR,
     to delays in the Bank Task Team Leader’s handling of No Objection requests.99
x    Delayed processing of the DFA Amendment. As noted above (see paragraphs 30 and 31)
     even though Bank Management had urged the supervision team in June 2006 to redeploy
     Project funds, Project proceeds were not reallocated – and the DFA amended - until
     November 2009, which, coupled with the disbursement challenges, partly caused by the
     Zambian team’s difficulty to account for Project expenditures, caused cash constraints that
     brought Project implementation almost to a halt in 2007. By the end of the disbursement
     grace period on July 31, 2011, this issue had still not been fully resolved.
x    Failure to improve the M&E system. The Project team was repeatedly encouraged to work
     closely with the Africa Region’s quality assurance team “to ensure a well-designed and
     monitorable M&E systems is in place? (ISRs No. 5, June 2005 and No. 6, August 2005).
     However, no evidence of such consultations was found in the Project files, and M&E
     indicators were not revised during Project implementation, as they should have been in order
     to make them more specific, relevant, and time-bound.
x    Community Development Small Grant category not established. Following the MTR, as part
     of the Project restructuring, in order to address the link between socio-economic development
     and environmental remediation, a community development fund was to be established to
     finance small scale, demand-driven socio-economic investments (see paragraph 33). While
     economic opportunities were provided, to a very limited extent, on a pilot basis, the
     community subproject component did not materialize even though it was for understandable
     – yet undocumented – reasons (to not increase the level of complexity of the already overly
     ambitious Project).
x    Failure to restructure Component 2. While the need for “a radical action plan to strengthen
     and restructure MSD? into a stronger semi-autonomous agency was identified early on during
     Project implementation100 the envisaged restructuring did not materialize, despite
     Management’s emphasis of the importance for “further strengthening of ECZ and MSD
     ability to enforce regulations.? However, a major restructuring of MSD would have been
     beyond the scope of the envisaged 5-year Project lifetime. While less than vigilant Bank
     supervision efforts have contributed to the lack of Project impact on MSD’s capacity, the
     Government’s lack of political will to fully empower MSD, in particular, during the Project’s


98
    The team could have addressed the continued slow implementation process in a more systematic and
proactive way. Bank Management appropriately noted, for example that the “project has been rated only
Moderately Satisfactory (MS) for about three years now. The performance of the project should be re-
assessed … for more realistic ratings?.
99
   In the case of Makululu Road in Kabwe, for example, the sub-project could not be implemented since the
contractor had increased its price beyond the budgeted amount during the nine months it took to receive the
No Objection.
100
    See ISRs No. 8, June 2007 and No. 6, August 2005, and letter from Country Director to Ministers of
MMMD and MFNP dated August 12, 2005.

                                                    31
      lifetime certainly was not conducive to capacity enhancement efforts. This should have been
      documented and addressed at a higher level between Bank Management and the Government.
x     Interface with private mining companies. Stakeholders as well as Bank Management101
      repeatedly emphasized that involving private sector mining companies in the mitigation of
      the environmental impacts of mining was crucial to achieving the PDO. However, there is no
      evidence of any efforts having been made by the Bank team to this effect.
x     Inadequate focus on sustainability. The importance, for example, of identifying measures
      that could have helped the Government ensure sustainability of the Kabwe lead management
      activities beyond the Project’s closing date in order to yield long-term results was
      appropriately emphasized in several ISRs from December 2008 to May 2009, yet it did not
      seem to have been a major discussion topic during supervision missions. As a result,
      arrangements to ensure sustainability of Project investments were not made, thus putting
      sustainability at risk.
x     Insufficient utilization of corporate risk list. The project was recognized from its preparation
      as representing an elevated level of corporate risk, mainly due to the inherently sensitive
      nature of issues it tackled and safeguards risks. As such, it was reviewed twice per year at the
      Sector Director or Regional Vice President (RVP) level. The enhanced monitoring and
      recognition of elevated risks, did not, however, lead to enhanced follow up on disbursement,
      FM, monitoring, and other issues that affected the project, and amplified the inherent risks.

79.      These supervision shortcomings were partly attributable to the fact that the Project was
supervised from Headquarters when more “hands on? supervision support could have been
provided from the country office. In addition, the Project was transferred around the time of
effectiveness from the Africa Region’s Environment Department to the then newly merged IFC
and Bank Mining Department; the Task Team Leadership was transferred from a Senior
Environment Specialist to a Senior Mining Specialist; there were also numerous changes in team
leadership that affected oversight of the Project during the course of its implementation. 102 The
lack of continuous presence of a social safeguards specialist on the team weakened the degree of
intended community involvement, and the absence of an institutional development or public
sector governance specialist impeded better oversight of the implementation of Component 2.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

80. Overall, Bank performance was Unsatisfactory. Even though essential analyses, designs,
implementation arrangements, financial management and procurement plans were in place and
endorsed by an internal senior level quality review team prior to funding approval, quality at
entry shortcomings were noted with regard to the M&E framework, the split oversight of
Components 1 and 2 of the Project, and the overly ambitious design of Component 2 for a 5-year
Project. During implementation, the Project achieved tangible results, especially under

101
    Multiple ISRs underscored the importance of tackling the complex and difficult interaction/interface
between the Government and the private sector and of identifying more efficient mechanisms for soliciting
private sector commitment to addressing active, as well as historical environmental liabilities (ISRs No. 14,
June 2010, No. 12, May 2009, and No. 13, December 2009). This did not materialize under the Project.
102
    The Project had a total of four Task Team Leaders (TTLs): the first TTL led the Project preparation
process; the second TTL led Project supervision from effectiveness in 2003 until 2010; a third TTL briefly
led the Bank’s supervision efforts from 2010 until project closure in 2011, at which point it was transferred
to a fourth TTL who handled the Project’s closing and Implementation Completion Report preparation.
Between 2003 and 2011, Project supervision was overseen by a total of four different Country Directors or
Designees and four different Sector Managers.

                                                    32
Component 1, to a large extent due to sound technical guidance related to mining and vigilant
supervision of safeguards issues provided by the Bank. However, as a result of supervision-
related shortcomings, such as significant delays in granting of no-objections, failure to timely
resolve disbursement issues, failure to restructure the Project to reallocate funds and add
community grant component, and failure to revise the M&E framework , the Bank’s supervision
team was responsible for some of the project implementation delays.

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

81.      Overall, the Government appears to have been supportive of parts of the Project,
especially Component 1. The recent signing of the 2011 Environmental Management Act by the
President demonstrated a commitment to environmentally sustainable development. With regard
to Component 2, however, the Government’s commitment to hold private mining companies not
fully complying with environmental standards accountable is ambiguous.103 In addition, the
transfer of tailings dams, whose reprocessing was found to be economically unviable, to private
investors who are reportedly not undertaking routine maintenance to minimize the risk of dam
leakage of failure, may pose a risk to the achievement of the PDOs.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

82.     Project oversight by the EMF Steering Committee seemed effective. Management by the
EMF Secretariat was problematic, mostly because of financial management issues (see below),
and the quality of project implementation management by ZECU was mixed. Overall, the ZECU
team showed genuine commitment, and it was rightly noted that under its leadership, “excellent
progress continues to be made on lead level management in Kabwe.? However, the following
shortcomings in ZECU’s performance were also observed:

x     Procurement. At the inception of Project implementation, ZECU’s inexperience and lack of
      familiarity with the preparation of procurement documents,104 coupled with the poor
      performance of some contractors during the first half of the Project, caused some
      implementation delays. These shortcomings were resolved during Project implementation.
x     Financial management. Several serious financial management shortcomings were observed
      on the part of ZECU and the EMF Secretariat, such as: delayed submission of quarterly
      interim financial reports; slow implementation of auditors’ recommendations; shortcomings
      in the internal audit function; reverting to a manual accounting system when the accounting
      software was not operational for six months; and their persistent difficulty in accounting for
      expenditures (see paragraphs 36 and 41 for details). It was appropriately noted that “both
      EMF and ZECU have been rather slow in resolving outstanding claims with the result that the




103
    One the one hand, ECZ is able to use and actually apply compliance tools, such as litigation and
temporary suspensions of mining permits to achieve compliance; at the same time, MMMD transferred the
environmental liabilities for the 13 tailings dams to private investors, who are unlikely to properly
maintain, rehabilitate and close the dams, thereby allowing these dams to leak into and pollute waterways.
104
    For example, ZCCM-IH/ZECU staff had never prepared bidding documents and had difficulties
estimating subproject costs, which led to delays in the procurement process, given that bidding documents
would occasionally have to be revised due to inaccurate bills of quantities.

                                                   33
      Project is short of available funds and payment of some contractors have (sic) been
      delayed.?105
x     Contract Management. In several instances, ZECU adopted unconventional and occasionally
      ineffective practices, seemingly motivated by a genuine desire to overcome implementation
      obstacles.106 The quality of supervision of physical works was, at times, suboptimal, as shown
      in the case of Tailings Dam 33c, where due the inferior quality of the contractor’s work, the
      drainage crumbled (and was subsequently repaired) before the end of the Project.
x     Exit Strategy. During Project implementation, insufficient attention was paid to ensuring the
      sustainability of investments after Project closing. In Kabwe, for example, the MoUs
      contained arrangements for handing over operation and maintenance responsibilities for
      investments made under the Project in water supply, play parks, public information centers,
      health clinics, etc. to the respective MoU counterparts. However, the exit strategy was not
      implemented due to a lack of focus on both ZECU’s and the Bank’s part.

83.     With regard to ECZ’s management of Component 2 several delays were largely
contributable to factors beyond the Agency’s control, such as delayed availability of funds and
procurement due to NDF-internal factors. While ECZ drafted the new Environmental
Management Act, which was signed by the President in May 2011 and reviewed and approved a
large number of EPBs, EIAs, and EMPs, the following significant performance shortcomings
were observed: (i) mining sites rehabilitated under the Project were not inspected or monitored on
a regular basis; (ii) meetings of the Inter Agency Environmental Coordination Committee were
not conducted on a regular basis; and (iii) annual work plans, budgets, and annual progress
reports were not submitted to NDF and the World Bank in a timely fashion.107

(b) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

84.      While the Government and ZCCM-IH demonstrated commitment to Component 1
activities during implementation, as evidenced by ZCCM-IH’s decision to finance select Project
activities from their own funds well beyond the closing date, the administration’s commitment to
a vigorous enforcement of environmental standards in the mining sector was less evident. The
performance of the EMF Secretariat overall was less than satisfactory; ZECU’s performance
varied from satisfactory with regard to lead mitigation activities in Kabwe to less than satisfactory
performance on financial management and occasionally the management of works contracts; and
ECZ’s performance was also less than satisfactory.




105
    In addition, community volunteer case managers and laboratory technicians had not been paid their
Project-related supplementary salaries since 2007 and subsequently stopped working for the Project.
106
    To remedy a non-performing contractor’s performance, for example, ZECU decided to retain the
contractor’s equipment and staff while replacing the subproject manager with one of its own engineers,
without prior consultation with the Bank. And, rather than contracting out activities, such as community
outreach, blood lead level monitoring, MoU agreements were negotiated with Government ministries, the
Kabwe Municipal Council, and the Kabwe Water Authority (Lukanga Water and Sewage Corporation).
Inconsistencies between the original and amended MoUs caused a great deal of confusion and further
disbursement delays at Project closing.

                                                  34
6. Lessons Learned

85.     In designing a potential follow-on Project in Zambia and similar operations elsewhere,
incorporating the following lessons learned with regard to Project design, implementation
arrangements, and Government commitment seems critical:

Lessons learned with regard to Project design
x Leveraging funding. It was appropriate for the Bank to focus on providing financing for the
   remediation of large-scale mining-related environmental liabilities and obligations under the
   first Project. In light of the profitability of the mining industry, though, Bank financing in the
   case of a second Project should play more of a leveraging role, i.e. mobilize substantial
   financial contributions from the Government, ZCCM-IH, and mining companies.
x Sharing mining profits with communities. Under the first Project, mining communities in the
   Copperbelt Province and Kabwe did not adequately benefit from the thriving mining sector.
   To this day, they continue to struggle with adverse mining-related environmental and public
   health impacts, poor access to basic social infrastructure services, and poverty. Mining
   companies should contribute to a fund that would enable communities living adjacent to
   mines and mineral processing plants to be proactively involved in the design and
   implementation of small-scale community-level investments that would improve local living
   and environmental conditions and livelihoods. Explicit emphasis should also be placed on
   addressing gender issues.
x Increased sustainability through community involvement in decision-making. Stronger
   emphasis on sustainability right from the beginning is crucial. While the design of the first
   Project envisioned meaningful participation of mining communities in the subproject cycle,
   this did not fully materialize during implementation. Affected communities could have been
   engaged more actively in the implementation of Project-funded investments, for example
   through labor-intensive public works. In some instances, community members actually
   reduced the sustainability of Project investments by stealing bricks and other parts of tailings
   dams’ drainage systems, which created a risk to their integrity, as well as the scavenging of
   sand, fences, etc. from play parks.
x Social accountability. More emphasis should be placed on fostering social accountability: (i)
   “supply side? governance through more access to information, in particular data on
   environmental compliance and revenues of mining companies; and (ii) “demand side?
   governance by which civil society plays an active role in pollution monitoring and holding
   the Government accountable for enforcing environmental laws and regulations and holding
   mining companies to environmental standards.
x A sound results framework and M&E system. SMART PDOs and key performance indicators
   are crucial. Baselines for subsequent impact evaluations should be established right from the
   beginning, possibly in collaboration with the Bank’s Research Department, so that
   preliminary results are available at MTR to discern whether changes to the results framework
   and M&E system are warranted.

Lessons learned with regard to implementation arrangements
x Bank supervision of complex and high-risk projects such as the CEP requires close
   collaboration between field based and headquarters based staff to ensure due diligence in
   project supervision, and to seize opportunities for dialogue. These include the Bank’s
   engagement in policy discussions and drawing attention to environmental concerns, as could
   have been the case during EITI discussions. Regardless of the location of Project TTL-ship,
   follow through is critical to ensure a prompt resolution of procurement, financial management
   and disbursement issues. In addition, a close partnership between environment and mining

                                                 35
    sector staff is critical, as is an adequate skills mix of the preparation and supervision teams. In
    order to achieve meaningful community involvement and institution building, the continued
    involvement of a Social Development Specialist and an Institutional Development/Public
    Sector Governance Specialist are important.

Lessons learned with regard to Government commitment
x Political will. The importance of strong and persisting political will, and in particular the
   Government’s demonstrated commitment to enforcing the mining industry’s compliance with
   environmental regulations is a critical prerequisite to sustainability and achieving the
   Project’s objectives. Given the complexity of the setting, changes in institutional structures as
   well as challenges in the implementation of their mandates, such as achieving compliance
   with environmental standards in the industry, are likely to require more time than a typical 5-
   year project horizon permits. It may therefore be necessary to phase change to afford the
   Government and its partners the opportunity to learn by doing, as well as the flexibility to
   adjust the design during the process.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.       The Project comprised two components: (i) Component 1 was designed to support Part (i)
of the PDOs, as stated in the Development Financing Agreement (DFA) to support the
Government in addressing environmental liabilities and obligations associated with the mining
sector, following the privatization of the mining assets of ZCCM; whereas Component 2 was
expected to support Part (ii) of the PDO, i.e., “to assist Zambia in strengthening the capacity of its
environmental regulatory institutions to improve future-compliance of the mining sector with
environmental and social regulations.?

2.      Table 1 shows the Outcome and Output indicators set out in the DFA. The analysis
presented in this Annex focuses on the Project’s Output Indicators listed in Table 1 below.
Indicators 2 through 4 correspond to Component 1 of the Project, and Indicators 1 and 5 pertain
to Component 2.

3.      Summary of Output/Intermediate Results Indicators for Components 1 and 2. The
Project achieved the following key Outputs/Intermediate Results.

Under Component 1:
(i) A Consolidated Environmental Management Plan (CEMP, also referred to as CEMP 2 or
    final version of the CEMP) was developed and utilized. The CEMP, which aimed to
    incorporate the Investors and Counterpart Environmental Management Plans (EMPs)
    prepared for the different investment packages, looked beyond individual mining sites at
    ecosystem-wide issues, such as watershed management and air pollution, as well as soil and
    sub-surface water contamination. The CEMP served to rank issues according to the severity
    of their potential impacts on human lives and the environment.

(ii) Physical works were carried out to improve people’s health and livelihoods through: (a)
     effective treatment of 2,822 children against lead poisoning and prevention of
     recontamination; (b) successful resettlement of 175 families from mine subsidence areas; (c)
     safe disposal of hazardous materials, including 150,000 cubic meters of radioactive uranium
     tailings, 272,000 kg of persistent organic pollutants waste, and 56,000 cubic meters of lead
     contaminated soils in the Copperbelt and Kabwe; (d) provision of safe water supply to 99,000
     members of vulnerable mining communities; (e) establishment of four Environmental Public


                                                 38
     Information Centers and rehabilitation of six Public Libraries; (f) improvement of household
     incomes through livelihood programs for women; and (g) maintenance and repairs of tailings
     dams to maintain their structural integrity.
(iii) The most significant Output/Results Indicator not achieved was the intended rehabilitation
     and closure of 17 tailings dams, due to the fact that the Ministry of Mines and Minerals
     Development (MMMD) had transferred 13 of them to private investors for reprocessing of
     the tailings’ copper content. Even though physical works on these dams were limited to
     maintenance and repairs of 7 dams these minor works helped to minimize the leakage levels
     of the tailings dams earmarked for rehabilitation and closure under the Project.

Under Component 2:
   (i)   Establishment of an environmental monitoring program, whose implementation was
         started under the Project;
   (ii)  Improved capacity and reduced staff turnover at ECZ
   (iii) Improved enforcement of environmental compliance by ECZ, including through the
         use of litigation.

4.       Box 1 below reviews the achievement of intended Outputs/Intermediate Results
Indicators in more detail. Boxes 1 and 2 highlight examples of Component 1 activities, which are
listed in detail in Table 2 below.

  sub-indicators                                                                  actual dates
 Indicator 1: Pollution flow from rehabilitated project sites into Kafue River watershed reduced
 by 70% (Component 1)
 Sampling of            ECZ periodically carried out water quality monitoring of the
 effluent from all      Kafue River, starting in 2007 (2004 and 2005 baseline data
 rehabilitated sites.   were collected during the preparation of the CEMP). Some of
                        the sampling points were monitored by designated agencies
                        such as ZECU and the Department of Water Affairs. The water
                        quality in the Kafue River at the end of the Project was, on
                        average, similar compared to before the Project. As Chart 1
                        below shows, the Total Suspended Solids (TTS) levels, used in
                        the ex ante Cost Benefit Analysis as a proxy for measuring
                        water pollution, varied greatly making it difficult to draw a
                        conclusion about the overall change in water quality. 108 While
                        these data suggest that Project activities did not generate a
                        significant improvement in water quality, at the same time the
                        water quality did not deteriorate due to ECZ’s stepped up
                        enforcement efforts despite doubling of copper production
                        between 2003 and 2010 (from 300 to 700 thousand tons).


108
    Except for the first sampling point K10, where the TTS level increased slightly between 2007 and 2010,
at all other sampling points the 2007 and 2010 values are identical. If compared with the 2001 and 2004
levels (see Environmental Assessment and CEMP, respectively), the TTS levels in 2010 were lower some
in instances (K41, K50, K65 and K90), in other cases the levels had increased (K30, K70). The great
variation in TTS levels at K30 and K41 is most likely attributable to pollution-reducing dredging activities
carried out under the Project and ongoing upstream pollution as a result of upstream mining activities.

 Indicator 2: Zero leakage of tailings from dams rehabilitated under the project (Component 1)

 Rehabilitation of         While geotechnical studies and safety assessments were            Not implemented
 tailings dams (TDs        completed for 13 tailings dams earmarked for closure under        due to sale of
 25, 26, 27, 35, 36, 37,   the Project, these were not rehabilitated towards closure, as     tailings dams to
 41, 38, and 39, 33C,      planned. Except for 2 overburden dumps and 3 tailings             investors for
 TD25, TD8, TD10           dams, due to the rise in copper prices since appraisal, all the   reprocessing
 towards closure).         dumps/dams were transferred by MMMD to new investors
                           for reprocessing of their copper content.109 Only
                           maintenance and minor repair works were performed on
                           tailings dams instead of the planned rehabilitation works to
                           contain the runoff and prevent leakage. Nevertheless, the
                           tailings dams earmarked for closure were 95% compliant
                           during Project implementation. There have been no dam
                           failures since Project interventions.



109
   The cost for closure and post-closure monitoring of these tailings dumps, to be borne by the new
owners, is estimated at US$39.2 million. To date, investors have not demonstrated any efforts to manage
and maintain the dams in the event that these are not reprocessed.

 ZCCM historical          and categorize historical liabilities. A checklist version of
 liabilities by CEMP      this ranking system was used by the EMF's Steering
 2 consultants            Committee as the basis for reviewing and approving
                          proposed subprojects.

 Indicator 5: Improvement of performance and capacity of ECZ and the Mines Safety
 Department (MSD) to enforce regulations (Component 2)

 Number of                On average, ECZ conducted about 90 site visits to a total of      Ongoing
 inspections carried      23 mining facilities per year between 2005-2010. About 7
 out by ECZ of all        site inspections are carried out per year for problematic
 companies identified     facilities. The site inspections were done in collaboration
 for monitoring           with MSD. At present, while very few facilities are certified
                          compliant with their EMPs, the overall compliance rate
 Number of facilities     with EMPs has increased from 35% in 2005 to 60% in
 certified compliant by   2010. The number of pollution control permits increased
 ECZ over total of        from 1,392 in 2005 to 3,582 by December 2010. Similarly,
 operations inspected     the number of enforcement notices rose, and two facilities
                          were ordered to shut down temporarily – and had their
 Number of non            licenses suspended – for non-compliance.110 The Project’s
 compliant operations     impact on the capacity of MSD and other intended
 halted by ECZ after      beneficiaries, such as academic and research centers was
 serious non              minimal, and interagency cooperation did not improve
 compliance               significantly due to infrequent and irregular meetings of the
                          Interagency Committee.

5.       As Table 3 below shows, the priorities identified during Project appraisal (PAD) were
rather similar to the ones identified by the CEMP, although the extent of remediation in Kabwe
was underestimated and was only revealed during the Kabwe Design and Scoping Study, which
took an indepth look at pathways and impacts of lead contamination at the household level. The
fact that the priority sub-projects were not fully identified at the start of the Project makes it
difficult to make a direct comparison between what was planned before the Project and what of it
was accomplished at the end of the Project.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis: Cost Benefit Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

1. Introduction

1.     The Copperbelt Environment Project (CEP) comprised two components. It (i) established
an Environmental Management Facility (EMF) that financed the costs of priority environmental
and social measures required of ZCCM-IH and the Government; and (ii) strengthened the
regulatory and institutional frameworks to ensure compliance of the mining sector with
environmental regulations, and to monitor implementation of investor and counterpart
Environmental Management Plans EMPs) at a cost of US$4 million. The total actual investment
costs amounted to about US$35.89 million.

2.    This Annex presents the results of the ex post Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA), which
assesses the environmental and social costs and benefits of mitigation measures implemented
under the Project. The results of the estimations are presented below.

3.     Summary of Benefits and Costs. The results of the CBA presented in this Annex indicates
an Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of 10 percent, or roughly 60 percent of the ERR calculated in
the ex ante CBA, according to which an 18 percent ERR was to be achieved as a result of Project
activities.

2. Results

4.    Costs. The Project costs included investment costs and maintenance costs. Under
Component 1, the EMF, actual total expenditures amounted to about US$38.27 million.
Investment costs were, on average, about US$4.35 million per year over 8 years (from 2003-
2010), and US$1.09 million for 2011, given that the Project closed at the end of the first quarter,
on March 31, 2011. Maintenance costs are estimated to be US$0.32 million per year over 20
years. With the inclusion of US$4 million for Component 2 expenditures on institutional
strengthening, investment costs amounted to US$35.89 million.

5.    In addition to cost estimations the cost computations include the consideration of "with-
and-without" Project scenarios; annual maintenance costs without the Project are expected to be
double (US$0.64 million) the maintenance costs with the Project (US$0.32 million). The
incremental costs (i.e. investment costs minus incremental maintenance costs) were US$4.03
million per year for the first 8 years, US$0.77 in year 9; incremental costs savings of US$0.32
million are expected per year thereafter.

6.     Benefits. The mitigation measures to be carried by the EMF were expected to generate
benefits in the form of lower soil contamination, water pollution and air pollution levels as well
as a reduction in the likelihood of a tailings dam failure.

7.    Benefits from reduced soil contamination. About 100,000 people were affected by lead
contamination in Kabwe. Lead-contaminated soil and windblown lead-contaminated dust are two
main pathways of lead exposure. In the ex ante CBA, the benefits from reduced soil
contamination were appropriately considered to be attributable to: (i) savings in treatment costs
for children aged 0-5 years; (ii) savings in treatment costs in persons aged 6-18 years; and (iii)
reduction in work days lost in those 19 years and older.


                                                54
8.    Of those persons that were impacted by lead in soil in Kabwe approximately 20,000 were
aged 0-5 years, and 40,000 aged 6-18 years. The remaining 40,000 were 19 years or older, of
whom approximately half, or 20,000, are (potentially) income earning. Under the Project, about
5,000 children were tested to determine their blood lead levels, and 2,822 of them received
treatment in the form of nutritional supplements or chelation therapy. The cost of treating 2,822
children amounted to US$378,357. Assuming the same testing-treatment ratio applies to the
remaining 15,000 children in Kabwe, the cost of treating (and re-treating in the event of re-
contamination) all 20,000 children would amount to about US$1,513,428. The cost of treating
40,000 youth, assuming that each 6-18 year-old makes one visit per year to a medical center for a
lead-related illness, estimated to be US$13 per person per year, would amount to $US 520,000
per year. The cost of workdays lost, in the case of each potentially income earning person 19
years or older forgoing 5 workdays per year, estimated to be $US11.00 per person per year,
would be US$220,000 per year. This is based on an average income of $US481 per year earned
over 220 workdays (data received from ZECU).

9.    The benefits of mitigation measures were translated into: a 95 percent savings in treatment
costs of children aged 0-5 years with costs rising at 2 percent per year; a 50 percent savings in
treatment costs of persons aged6-18 years with costs increasing at 2 percent per year; a 50 percent
reduction in workdays lost by half of those persons aged 19 years and over using half of annual
income (reflecting a combination of work and leisure lost) rising at 2 percent per year. The total
non-discounted benefits amount to US$42.76 million.

10. Benefits from reduced water pollution. Water pollution in the form of suspended solids
entering the Kafue River continues to impact people’s quality of life. The ex ante CBA estimated
that benefits would accrue from reductions in suspended solids in the form of reduced
maintenance and treatment costs of pump stations located along the Kafue River. However, the
water sampling data (see Annex 1) collected along the Kafue River between 2007 and 2010 (and
in some instances also in 2001 and 2004) suggests that the Project did not generate a tangible
improvement in the water quality in the River, as measured by the change in the quantity (mg/l)
of Total Suspended Solids (TSS).

11. However, in spite of a more than 100 percent increase in copper production between 2003
and 2010 from about 300,000 to 700,000 tons per year the water quality has not deteriorated. This
is considered to be attributable to more vigorous compliance enforcement efforts on the part of
ECZ, as a result of support provided to the agency under the Project. It is assumed that the
benefits associated with the prevention of a deterioration in the water quality, which could have
been expected in light of the considerable increase in copper production, amounts to 50 percent of
the benefits calculated for benefits from reduced water pollution in the ex ante CBA.

12. Benefits from reduced air pollution. Air pollution, due to dust and sulphur dioxide, was
prevalent in Mufulira and deemed to have a high impact on human health in Kankoyo and a
medium impact on human health in Kantanshi. The ex ante CBA anticipated Project activities to
generate benefits from reduced air pollution in the form of: (i) savings in treatment costs in 0-5
year olds; (ii) savings in treatment costs in 6-18 year olds; and (iii) reduction in work days lost in
those 19 years and older. According to air quality monitoring data collected by Mopani Copper
Mines for the period from July - December 2010, the SO2 concentration in ambient air in
Kantanshi (Clinic No. 3) was 100 percent above the WHO guideline limit of 125µg per m3 per
24-hour period; and the SO2 level in Kankoyo (Clinic No. 5) was more than 83 percent above the
guideline limit (data provided by ZCCM-IH). The limited data available on ambient air quality
suggests that the Project did not have a significant positive impact on improving ambient air
quality.

                                                 55
13. However, in spite of a more than 100 percent increase in copper production between 2003
and 2010 from about 300,000 to 700,000 tons per year the air quality has not deteriorated. This is
considered to be attributable to the more vigorous compliance enforcement efforts on the part of
ECZ, as a result of support provided to the agency under the Project. It is assumed that the
benefits associated with the prevention of a deterioration in the air quality, which could have been
expected in light of the considerable increase in copper production, amounts to 50 percent of the
benefits calculated for benefits from reduced air pollution in the ex ante CBA.

12. Benefits from reduced likelihood of a tailings dam failure. In the event of a failure of the
tailings dams at Chonga and Akatiti water pollution, in the form of suspended solids entering the
Luanshya River would adversely impact people’s quality of life. The ex ante CBA assumed that
reducing the likelihood of a tailings dam failure would result in benefits in the form of savings in
the costs of treatment of drinking water and maintenance of pump stations located along the
Luanshya River.

14. While no dam failure occurred during Project implementation, partly as a result of
maintenance works carried out at five dams, including Chonga and Akatiti, and repair works at
another two dams, the Project generated only limited benefits in terms of water treatment and
maintenance cost savings. A total of 13 tailings dams, including Chonga and Akatiti, were to be
rehabilitated towards closure under the Project. These works were not undertaken, since in light
of the more favorable copper prices, the MMMD proceeded to transfer the mining rights for
reprocessing the dams, along with the responsibility for maintenance and eventual closure, to
private investors. While ZCCM-IH data suggests that leakage was zero during Project
implementation, ongoing mining operations continued to discharge tailings into the Luanshya
River. It is therefore assumed that the Project generated only 5 percent instead of the expected 15
percent savings in maintenance and treatment costs, increasing at 2% per year, and only for the
duration of the Project.

    Outcome objectives did not change during Project implementation and were attained. However, TDs
were not closed as focus changed to reprocessing.
114
    Sustainability rating is highly likely as most subprojects were implemented with involvement of
stakeholders and at mine sites acquired by private investors.
115
    High experience and skills have been developed by the Implementing Agent in implementing World
Bank funded project.

    Late amendment to the DFA, infrequent supervision and untimely issuance of no objections affected
timely implementation of project.

3. Assessment of Development Objectives and Design, and Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objectives
The overall objective of the project was to facilitate the completion of the privatization of ZCCM
by assisting the GRZ in remediating environmental liabilities that were not taken up by new
mining investors. The specific objectives of the project were to address environmental liabilities
and obligations associated with the mining sector, following the privatization of the mining assets
of ZCCM and strengthen the capacity of its environmental regulatory institutions to improve
future compliance of the mining sector with environmental and social regulations.

3.2    Revised Objectives
The Objectives of the Project were not revised.

3.3 Original Components

The project, estimated at a total of US$ 50.8 million, consisted of two components as follows:

3.3.1 Environmental Management Facility (EMF)
The activities of the component were not changed.

3.3.2 Strengthening of the Environmental Regulatory Framework
The activities of the component were not changed.

3.4 Project Design and Quality at Entry

The project quality at entry was satisfactory as it addressed the right issues to support the
privatization of ZCCM. The design by setting up of ZCCM – IH Environmental Coordination
Unit (ZECU) and the Environmental Management Facility (EMF) as pillars for project
implementation, instead of using the line Ministries, helped to enhance implementation.

However, the design had a few shortcomings. The project start up did not clearly have identified
liabilities to be addressed, apart from what was identified in the Interim Environmental
Management Plan (IEMP). These full liabilities were only identified after the completion of
Consolidated Environmental Management Plan (referred to in this ICR as CEMP 2 or final
version of the CEMP) and the Kabwe Scoping and Design Study (KSDS). At project
effectiveness, 23% of the resources from IDA were unallocated because of this lack of full
knowledge of the liabilities. Furthermore, the CEMP 2 was only completed in 2005 and the
KSDS in 2006. This resulted in delays of 2 and 3 years respectively before the full
implementation could commence.

The Project Preparatory Facility (PPF) was used to undertake project preparation (such as
Copperbelt Environment Assessment, ZCCM-IH Counerpart Environmental Management Plans,
Negotiations of Liabilities, Project Implementation Manual, etc) while the LRP was used mainly
for implementation of liabilities identified in the Interim Environmental Management Plan
(IEMP). While this was important because of the concerns of health and safety placed on the
liabilities in the IEMP, adequate resources should have been made available for the
implementation of the two important studies, namely CEMP 2 and KSDS under the PPF. This
resulted in the delay in implementation of the project, hence the two project closing dates
extensions.




                                                  65
The privatization of the mining industry led to loss of formal employment and incomes as new
investors focused on core business of mining which also led to dependency on unsustainable
exploitation of natural resources for survival resulting in environmental degradation.
Furthermore, the findings of CEMP 2 identified and ranked highest, economic empowerment and
job creation. Consequently, the project midterm review of 2006, resolved that community grants
should be introduced in the DFA to create economic opportunities for the affected communities.
However, the amendment of the DFA did not include community grants and therefore the
community grant component was not implemented.

On the other hand, implementation of component two at ECZ was placed within the institutional
line. While this was important for capacity building and institutional sustainability, there were
challenges, viz, coordination with the delegated institutions supported under the project and
internal project.

4.    Achievement of Objectives and Output

The project was to achieve set objectives and output through implementation of the two
components. The performance indicators with achievements are presented in appendix 1. The
performances under each component are presented below;

4.1 Component 1
A number of sub-projects were implemented so as to achieve the objective of the component. The
full lists of sub-projects implemented are attached at appendix 2.

4.1.1 Studies
The component undertook studies as part of the process including the following;
Interim Environmental Management Plan: The plan contained interventions which were
identified considering health and safety as well as those which were part of the sale development
agreement with the new investors prior to project effectiveness.

CEMP 1: Assisted ZCCM-IH to identify retained assets and potential ongoing environmental
impacts following privatisation of ZCCM Ltd. It further indentified historical liabilities arising
from the operations of the mine sites prior to privatisation and social impacts associated with the
privatisation of the mines. The CEMP I further recommended remedial measures for the facilities
retained by ZCCM-IH.

CEMP II: The CEMP II consolidated the site specific environmental obligations that remained
with ZCCM-IH (as detailed in the Counterpart EMPs) and those obligations that are the
responsibility of investors (as detailed in the Investor EMPs). It Identified and investigated, the
cumulative and downstream impacts of mining activities on public safety and health and critical
ecological functions most particularly the impact of mining activities on the Kafue River
watershed that were not captured in the Counterpart and Investor EMPs.
The study also determined who was responsible for addressing environmental liabilities.

KSDS: The KSDS determined the extent and level of contamination by toxic substances arising
from past mining operations in and around Kabwe. The study identified the main sources and
pathways of lead contamination to humans, designed follow up measures for reducing lead levels
in blood below 25µg/dL which was an interim action standard, particularly in children impacted
by the Kabwe mine, developed a risk communication program which will deliver appropriate
messages to all interested parties in the resolution of impact of lead in the project area. KAPB
Survey: In Kabwe, a Knowledge Attitude Practice and Beliefs (KAPB) survey was also

                                                66
undertaken to provide the baseline for the project. Based on the KAPB survey a risk
communication strategy was developed.

4.1.2 Sub-Projects Implemented on the Copperbelt

Hazardous Waste: To safeguard public health and safety, hazardous materials including
Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) and Uranium tailings were identified for remediation.
Approximately 220 tonnes of PCBs oils and PCB contaminated materials and soils were
removed from five sites ( Kitwe, Mufulira, Kalulushi, Chingola and Kabwe) and disposed off
by high temperature incineration in Europe in an environmentally sound manner to comply with
contractual obligations between ZCCM and the new mine investors. Approximately 150, 000
cubic meters of uranium tailings and uranium tailings contaminated materials identified adjacent
to Mindolo township were removed and disposed at an engineered cell at TD15A.

Resettlements: A number of communities living in areas earmarked for mine expansion as well
as those in areas considered dangerous due to mine operations were resettled in safe areas.

In Chililabombwe, a total of 66 and 74 houses were constructed and a total of 840 people were
resettled from surplus of the ZCCM Labour Reduction Program provided under IDA Public
Sector Reform and Export Promotion Credit (PSREP Cr. 3167 –ZA). This project intervention
facilitated the investment by Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) in excess of US$1.6 billion in
Konkola Deep Mining Project, which will eventually increase company’s copper production by
approximately 200,000 metric tonnes per annum.

In Mufulira, a total of 21 and 44 houses were constructed at Kawama and Chibolya respectively.
A total of 517 people were resettled at the two sites. In Kitwe, a further 90 houses were
constructed and 583 people were resettled.

Dumps: The objectives of the dumps closure were to protect public health and safety, reduce or
prevent environmental degradation and allow productive use of land similar to its original use or
an acceptable alternative. A total of 14 Tailings dams (TD’s) and 15 Overburden dumps (OB’s)
were earmarked for closure. However, in 2006, the focus changed from closure to reprocessing
due to high copper prices, which resulted in these dumps being considered as a resource to
recover residual metals by the private investors. The Government therefore decided to grant large
scale mining licences over the TDs and OBs to private investors. Prior to granting of these
mining licenses, adhoc maintenance works were carried out by the Project in order to safeguard
the integrity of the dumps.

Defunct facilities: At the time of privatization there were some decommissioned facilities, which
were not taken over by new mine owners. As part of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, ZCCM-
IH was required to demolish and clean up the sites in order to avail the land for alternative use.
For example:
    x The High Grade Tailings Leach Plant was demolished and a new smelter and acid plants
       were constructed. As a result of this project, jobs were indirectly created due to new
       development on the sites and the other benefits, which accrued to GRZ included
       increased tax revenues.

    x   Only 40% of the Demolition and Site Cleanup of No.1 Nkana Cobalt Plant was done.
        The remaining works could not be carried out due to initial flawed demolition design
        resulting in high cost of demolition. However, new designs have been prepared and the
        subproject is ready for implementation.

                                               67
    x   In addition various structures at Kansanshi mine were demolished and the site cleaned in
        2001. A new mine was built and commissioned in 2005.

Kafue River Water Quality Monitoring: One of the performance indicators of the Project was
to reduce pollution load into the Kafue River by 70% from rehabilitated project sites (dumps).
Although none of the dumps were rehabilitated, nevertheless, the Project carried out periodic
monitoring of the quality of water in the Kafue River and its tributaries. The findings of Project
(under CEMPII) indicated that 90% of the pollution load in the Kafue River was from ongoing
operations. The result of the monitoring programme has been useful to ECZ, MSD and others.

Supply of Potable Water to Mushishima Community under the Community Development
Framework: During the time of ZCCM operations, the Mushishima Community was provided
with potable water. This was done due to pollution of Mushishima stream and low water table
resulting from mine dewatering. At privatization the new mine owners were not willing to take
over the responsibility of supplying water to the community. Through the Project the community
was provided with potable water, which benefited about 2,000 people.

Public Information and Risk Communication: The objective was to effectively communicate
and raise awareness on the risks associated with mining environmental related issues. To address
this, Environmental Public Information Centres (EPICs) were established to serve as public
disclosure centres and as reference centers for research and other educational and academic
purposes. The Project constructed EPICs in Kalulushi and Chambishi and rehabilitated the
Kitwe, Mufulira, Luanshya and Chililabombwe Public Libraries for use as EPICs. However, the
planned rehabilitations of Ndola ZCCM-IH Archivers and Ndola Public Library were not
undertaken due to time constraints.

4.1.3 Subprojects implemented in Kabwe
The overall project objective in Kabwe was to reduce blood lead levels in affected children to
initially an interim lead level of 25ug/dL and ultimately to WHO recommended level of 10ug/dL.

The following activities were carried out:

4.1.3.1. Mine Site Rehabilitation Plan
Plant Area: The main objective was to remove public health hazard arising from human
access to and/or the emanation of contamination from Kabwe mine site. All decommissioned
plant infrastructure and equipment were demolished and removed from the mine site. These were
disposed off at a safer site.

Mine Waste Dumps: The main aim was to rehabilitate and close mine waste dumps through re-
vegetation. This was required as a means to suppress wind-blown lead contaminated dust.
However, rehabilitation was not done as the dumps were sold by GRZ to new investors.

4.1.3.2. Community Lead Risk Mitigation Strategy

Kabwe Main Canal Zone Rehabilitation: The objective was to reduce/eliminate human health
hazards caused by lead contamination through removal of contaminant sources from communities
within the vicinity of Kabwe Main Canal Zone. The Project removed a total of 56,000 cubic
meters of lead contaminated soils from the banks of Kabwe Main Canal and disposed it at a
designated site. However, profile sampling of the Kabwe Main Canal has revealed that the base
and sides of the canal are still highly contaminated with Lead. Unless the canal is concrete lined,
dredging and removal of the lead contaminated soils from the Canal Zone has to be done on a

                                                68
regular basis. Any occurrence of flooding and dredging of the canal would result in
recontamination of the banks.

Community Water Supply Improvement:The subproject provided adequate water for dust
suppression and for health and hygienic purposes in Makululu, Makandanyama, Kasanda, Mutwe
Wansomfu, Chowa, Waya and Katondo. The objective was to reduce risk of exposure to lead
through inhalation and ingestion. Approximately 100,000 people have benefited. The other
benefit has been a significant reduction of cholera occurrence since 2005 in the project areas
which can, in part be attributed to improved hygiene due to availability of water (see Table 1).

Vegetation Barrier Programme: The objective was to reduce windblown dust and reduce the
impacts of lead contamination in communities. The target was to plant Lawn (Kapinga) grass and
Moringa trees at 7000 households and only Lawn grass at 10 schools. A total of 3000 households
had Kapinga grass planted with 6000 Moringa trees planted, two at each of the household. Only 6
schools benefited. The balance of 4000 households and 4 schools are outstanding.

Removal of Mine Waste from Residential Areas and from Mulungushi Road Slag Dump:
The objective was to reduce/eliminate human health hazards caused by Lead contaminated
materials in the communities. Approximately 4000 cubic meters of Lead-contaminated mine
waste was removed from residential areas, while 30,000 cubic meters was removed from
Mulungushi Road Slag Dump and disposed safely at a designated site.

Public Information and Risk Communication: The objective was to effectively communicate
and raise awareness on the risks associated with Lead. To address these EPICs were established
in Makululu, Kasanda and Katondo. The project also rehabilitated the Town Centre Library.

Integrated Case Management (ICM): The objective of is to reduce elevated blood lead levels
in the affected children in Chowa, Kasanda Katondo, Mutwe Wansofu, MaKandanyama and
Makululu townships to interim blood lead level of 25ug/dl and ultimately to WHO
recommended level of 10ug/dl.
The Project rehabilitated four health centres at Makululu, Kasanda, Chowa and Zambia Railways
to provide adequate space for ICM programmes.
Three recruitments were undertaken between 2007 and 2010 with a total of 5986 children
sampled for blood lead levels. Table 2 below shows that there was significant reduction in the
blood lead levels during the periods 2007-2008 and 2008 - 2009 compared to 2009 -2010. This
was caused by inadequate funds caused by delay to amend the DFA, which resulted in nil stocks
of drugs and nutrition supplements most of the time.




117
   The increased prevalence was attributed to the flooding, which occurred in 2008 due to above normal
rainfall, which was experienced.

Due to various constraints attributed to inadequate disbursement from IDA , the programme
was unable to sustain progressive reductions in the geomeans and was unable to achieve the
intended interim geomean of 25ug/dL.

Public Play Parks: The objective was to provide Lead free and safe play areas for children in
order to reduce the risk of exposure to Lead. A total of 11 play parks were constructed in the
affected (Chowa, Kasanda, Katondo, Mutwe Wansofu, MaKandanyama and Makululu)
communities and Clayton Park was rehabilitated.

Economic Empowerment: The objective was to empower communities with business skills and
provide infrastructure in order to alleviate poverty. The Project constructed a total of three
markets, one hammer mill with a shelter and provided start-up capital for ten community
clubs.

4.1.4 Environmental Protection Fund
The Mines and Minerals Act of 1995 provided for the establishment of Environmental Protection
Fund (EPF) for the mining sector. In 2007, the Statutory Instrument was issued but due to
financial and logistical constraints the EPF was not established. It was therefore decided that the
Fund be established with the support of the Project. The Fund has two key objectives. Firstly, to
provide assurance to the Director of Mines Safety Department that the developers shall
implement their Environmental Management Commitments, stipulated in their EMPs. Secondly,
to provide guarantee to Government that public fund shall not be used to clean up environmental
liabilities of the developers in the event that they fail to do so.
In excess of US$180 million has been assessed as being closure liability for 30 large scale mining
and mineral processing facilities. Out of this total amount, US$8.5 million cash has been
contributed by the developers into the EPF. A further US$9.7million in guarantee has been
secured by one developer, while 21 operations have not secured their guarantees.


118
    Classes of Lead in blood are defined as follows; Class 1= 0 to 9ug/dl, Class 2 =10 to 19ug/dl, Class 3=
20 to 44ug/dl, Class 4 =45 to 64ug/dl and Class 5 = above 65ug/dl.

    Geometric means refers to a mean or average which indicates the central tendency of a typical value of a
set of numbers. The numbers are multiplied and the nth root (where n is the count of numbers in the set) of
the resulting product is taken.

4.2.    Component 2

The component was implemented through sub-components as follows;

4.2.1 Environmental Legislation Review
The main focus of this sub-component was to improve the legal framework and strengthen
enforcement capacity. This was to be done through strengthening environmental legislation in
order to improve monitoring and enforcement and to review pollution standards so as to
incorporate total pollutant loads in pollution permits. As a result of implementing this sub-
component, the old Act was repealed and a new Act has been accented into Law.

4.2.2 Environmental Management and Compliance Monitoring
The overall objective of the sub-component was strengthening the capacity of ECZ to regulate the
mining industry in accordance with environmental legislation and standards. This was to be done
through issuance of pollution control permits, imposition of fines, having a dedicated compliance
monitoring programme, development and approval of EMPs, thereby reducing pollution loads
and the negative health effects of mine pollution.
This resulted in the Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) for all the targeted mining
companies including ZCCM-IH were submitted and ECZ conducted monitoring activities to
ensure that implementation was carried out in accordance with the regulations.

4.2.3   ECZ Capacity Building

The overall objective of sub-component was to have enhanced ECZ’s capacity to address its
institutional weaknesses for effective enforcement of environmental regulations and improved
environmental performance of the mining industry.
Following a needs assessment, a training policy was developed and adopted in 2004, and
implemented.

4.2.4 Environmental Emergency Response
The overall objective of this sub-component was to enhance preparedness of the Environmental
Emergency Response (EER) System and its ability to effectively respond to emergencies. ECZ
procured EER equipment and Members of staff from ECZ and Mines Safety Department (MSD)
were trained in environment emergency based on the EER protocol developed was being used as
a guide in responding to environmental emergency. A toll free environmental emergency hotline
was established at ECZ to enable members of the public to report any environmental emergency
at less cost on their part. In addition to the above achievement, ECZ also trained police officers in
the identification of Hazardous Materials so as to enable them be effective participants in
environmental emergencies situation without endangering lives.

4.2.5 Coordination and Capacity Building with Strategic Partners

The main focus of this sub-component was capacity building of the delegated authorising
agencies so that they are fully integrated into the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
process and were effectively participating in environmental management and compliance
monitoring. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between ECZ and MSD, and
the latter was provided with logistical support. An Interagency Environmental Coordinating
Committee (IECC) was formed and continued to hold regular meetings annually.


                                                 71
4.2.6 Environmental Awareness and Public Participation

The main objective of this sub-component was to build capacity of civil society so as to enhance
their participation in environmental management and enforcement of compliance through more
pro-active strategies. A communication and marketing strategy was developed and adopted by the
Council in 2008. Based on this, ECZ carried out sensitization workshops for the key stakeholders
on their role in the Environmental Regulatory Framework. Additionally, ECZ participated in
several national exhibitions and commemoration of significant international environmental
related days annually.

5.      Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

Design:
The design of the Project, which did not provide for studies to identify mitigation measures
before Project effectiveness, resulted in delay in implementation. Therefore, the outcome could
not be met timely when the full mitigation measures where only fully known three years after the
project implementation had commenced.

Lender:
The Project has been supervised by a Task Team Leader (TTL) different from the one who
prepared the Project. This was satisfactory because he was adequately supported by Bank staff120
who were also involved in the preparation until the Mid Term Review (MTR) of 2006. However,
after the MTR, the supervision team reduced in number which resulted in some of the proposed
decisions not being implemented. For example, the MTR proposed a formal restructuring of the
Project Development Financing Agreement to address the Project shortcoming including the
unallocated funds to pay for consultancies which had exhausted its allocation and introduction of
community grants category in the Project. The restructuring to distribute the unallocated funds
and provide for overruns on consultancy was only approved in 2009, which is approximately 4
years after the decision was made. In the prevailing period, the TTL was approving over
expenditure, on a case by case basis, on the categories that should have benefited from the
restructuring. This resulted in the TTL getting involved in disbursement and caused substantial
delays.

The Community grants category was not introduced in the project despite the MTR emphasizing
the importance. The TTL was again because of the importance of this, compelled to approve
community grants on a case by case basis. In Kabwe, he approved construction of three markets,
provision of one hammer mill and start up money for 10 community groups. While this was
shown to have worked, it fell short of the proposed community grants that should have been
introduced to the Project categories.

As a result of reduced support to the TTL, the turn around on request for No Objection was
substantially affected. In some cases delays were beyond 10 months and this therefore affected




120
   Earlier World Bank supervision mission had a number of bank staff participating including from
environment, financial management, social, procurement and mining specialists. Some of them were
involved in the preparation of the project. After the MTR, IDA supervision mission were usually the TTL
and one other staff member.


                                                   72
implementation resulting in some of the sub-projects being delayed and in some cases not being
implemented121.

Disbursement has also been affected by Disbursement Division’s inconsistency in applying
disbursement rules. For prior review, the requirement is to submit the certification for the works
and/or services and the invoices for each payment. However, Disbursement Division required
TTLs approval at this stage as well. In cases of Statement of Expenditure (SOE), there were cases
when Disbursement Division required contracts when only evidence of payment was required for
disbursement. This delayed disbursements.

Borrower:
Insufficient GRZ counterpart funding due to economic constraints: While the overall socio-
economic situation did not directly affect the Project, it may have influenced the Project
indirectly, e.g., through limiting government’s ability to provide counterpart funding. This was
notable in the reduced allocation of counterpart funding in the approved National budget which
was less than required allocation.

Implementing Agent: Project Implementation was under taken under (ZECU). It was responsible
for the development of detailed sub-project proposals, implementation and procurement. The unit
was staffed with a broad complement of staff sufficient for the required task. However, while
these personnel were specialized in their fields of competence, they did not have experience in
IDA procedures. This resulted in initial delay in implementation during the learning period.

The implementing agent had two accounts for managing the credit and grant funds. In the original
design, the credit was envisaged to pay for works only and all consultancies were to be paid from
the grant. Most works could only be implemented after consultancies were done, e.g.
development of EPBs, design of works etc. However, the funds in the consultancy category were
exhausted resulting in works not being implemented on time and services not being paid for. To
avoid litigation on delayed payments, ZECU used credit funds to pay for consultancy even
though this was not provided for in the DFA. This resulted in delayed replenishment which
affected the project cash flow position.

Environmental Management Facility (EMF):The EMF was set up with a steering committee
and secretariat to manage the project. The EMF Steering Committee was responsible for
ensuring that the programme of activities that will be carried out under the EMF is consistent with
the EMF objectives and policies approved by GRZ and ZCCM-IH and agreed with the donors.
The Committee was also responsible for approving the specific proposals for all mitigation
measures and remedial activities to be financed by the EMF. They were supported by a secretariat
for day to day administration.

While the EMF Steering Committee had a broad representation in composition, it lacked specific
technical expertise to fully appraise sub-project to be approved. This resulted in delays on
decisions of the sub-projects to be implemented. The Task Team Leadership, to address this
concern, proposed retaining of an Independent Assessment Team (IAT) to provide technical
advisory services to the EMF SC.

EMF Secretariat was responsible for managing the transfer of funds to ZECU. The Secretariat
was also responsible for replenishment of the Project Special Account from WB and NDF. There

121
  For example Makululu Road Rehabilitation and Copperbelt Community Awareness sub-project were not
implemented due to delayed No Objection.

                                                73
was also delayed replenishment which affected the project cash flow. The delay was caused by a
number of factors including delayed amendment to the DFA to provide adequate resources for
mainly consultancy activities, ZECU ‘borrowing’ of credit funds to pay for grant financed only
activities mainly consultancy services, delayed preparation of replenishment by EMF,
inadequately supported documentation from ZECU, etc.


Environmental Council of Zambia: The ECZ was responsible for implementing component 2.
The capacity of ECZ was enhanced but due to various challenges several deliverables were not
attained.

There were frequent changes in project management both at ECZ and NDF which contributed to
delays and non attainment of various deliverables. Furthermore, there is need to undertake
adequate project risk assessment, if a number of project deliverables are dependent on
externalities as these could hinder the success of the project. Under ECZ, several procurements
were dependant on several externalities for their success which resulted in delayed delivery of
key goods, which were a major milestone in ECZ capacity enhancement.

Mine Safety Department: Mine Safety Department (MSD) is a key institution for the
enforcement of mining environmental sectoral regulations but did not get the attention to
strengthen its capacity to fulfill its responsibility. The MTR proposed to define specific MSD
institution capacity building program requiring radical rationalization of the institution, including
transforming it into an autonomous agency with support of US$ 1 million. However, this was not
implemented because Government was not committed to the radical rationalization.


    6. Sustainability

Component I

Project Management- The project established a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) with a
whole array of professional staff at ZECU and EMF. ZCCM-IH has integrated all staff in its
mainstream structure to ensure that these skills are readily available for implementation in the
event that the project is extended. Similarly, Government is in the short run responsible for EMF
staff.

Hazardous Waste -The mines sites where PCBs were removed and disposed have been acquired
by new mine investors as part of the Sale and Purchase Agreements (contractual).

The uranium tailings and uranium tailings contaminated materials removed were deposited at the
engineered cell constructed at TD15A, a tailings disposal facility that is owned and operated by
Mopani Copper Mines Plc. A post maintenance and monitoring period of up to ten years has been
instituted by ZCCM-IH in order to ensure physical integrity and control any possible pollution.
The sites where the Uranium tailings and Uranium tailings material were removed have been
handed to MCM who are owners of the pieces of land.

Resettlement – The Project resettled communities in Chililabombwe, Mufulira and Kitwe, and
provided alternative livelihood options. To ensure security of tenure, titles deeds will be issued to
house owners.



                                                 74
Dumps– The closure of the tailings dams by the Project was not implemented as a decision was
taken during project implementation to explore the possibility of reprocessing the tailings for the
metal value. With the exception of only two overburden dumps and three tailings dams, all the
dumps/dams have been transferred to new investors following granting of Mining Licence by the
MMMD. However, the investors have not demonstrated responsibility to manage and maintain
the Tailings Dams in the event that these are not reprocessed since there is no evidence on the
ground. In addition, there is a risk of these Tailings Dams being abandoned should the copper
prices slump on the international market and the responsibility for maintenance and eventual
closure reverting to GRZ. The cost for closure and Post monitoring of the tailings dumps
transferred to private investors is estimated at US$32 Million.

Defunct facilities - The cleaned up areas where the defunct facilities were located have been
handed over to the new investors for alternative use.

Water supply- Mushishima Water project is now managed by Mulonga Water and Sewerage
Company. The same is true for the Kabwe Water project which is being managed by Lukanga
Water and Sewerage Company. While water provision in Kabwe will continue, the vandalism of
stand water pipes has affected the suppression of lead contaminated dust. Furthermore, the
suppression of lead contaminated dust will not be maintained as the water utility company plans
to reduce the number of stand water stand pipes to a limited number of kiosks.

EPICs– The Local Authorities have assumed responsibilities of managing the EPICs with all
staff and maintenance costs internalized.

ICM – The effects of high Lead in blood manifests in the community, especially in children
under the age of five through a number of signs and symptoms122. The Lead Treatment Protocol
developed by a team of Medical Doctors from the Ministry of Health (MOH), University
Teaching Hospital, Kabwe Urban District Management Team (KUDHMT) and Kabwe Mine and
General Hospitals in consultation with ZECU, is being implemented in Kabwe. The syllabus on
Lead Pollution has been incorporated in the School of Medicine curriculum at 6th Year level to
ensure that graduating medical doctors are equally conversant with Lead Poisoning and Lead
Treatment Protocols. ICM activities are conducted at Health Centres which are established health
centres under the MOH and KUDHMT. ZCCM-IH has assumed the funding of ICM activities
until such a time it is integrated into the Ministry of Health mainstream programmes. However,
the Ministry of Health of the Government of Zambia emphasizes mounting a sustained clinical
intervention programme based on morbidity and mortality.

Play Parks – While the provision of play parks was important to ensure that children avoid
playing in lead contaminated dust and therefore limiting their exposure to Lead, vandalism has
affected the operation of most play parks. The KMC has given assurance to extend security to all
parks

EPF – The EPF has set up and will be managed by Mines Safety Department.



122
  Classic signs and symptoms of lead poisoning can include loss of appetite, abdominal pain, vomiting,
weight loss, constipation, anemia, irritability, learning disabilities and behavior problems.




                                                   75
ECZ - Activities of the ECZ will be self sustained through the fees and fines which CEP
helped to establish through preparation of the Law to transform the council into a self sustaining
agency.

MSD - While Government signed the Law to transform ECZ into an agency, there is still no
commitment to radical rationalization of MSD. The radical rationalization proposal was aimed to
transform MSD into an agency which would have provided benefits of autonomy and ability to
use the revenue generated from licenses and levies collected. At the moment, all revenue
generated is surrendered to the Treasury at the Ministry of Finance and National Planning. In its
current form, MSD will continue to rely on appropriation from Government for it operation,
which is in most cases inadequate and erratic. This will affect it operations and that of the EPF.

NDF endorses the main assessments in IDA’s draft ICR report.

NDF participation into CEP was designed jointly with IDA in order to coordinate the sub-
components and contracts to be financed from NDF credit. EUR 5.3 million of NDF credit was
allocated for Component 1 and EUR 4.7 million for Component 2. NDF funds were provided as
parallel co-financing where selection of sub-components and contracts was to be made in
cooperation with the implementing agencies, NDF and the World Bank. Review of procurement
documents and decisions was to be carried out by NDF who would consult the World Bank where
needed. World Bank team support was expected for monitoring of project and contracts.

Under Component 1 NDF financed the consultancy for preparation of CEMP1 (EUR 2.47
million), removal and disposal of PCB waste from Kabwe, Kalulushi and Kitwe (Nkana Cobalt
plant) (EUR 0.41 million), removal and disposal of AMCO uranium tailings in Kitwe (EUR 2.02
million), consultancy for preparation of removal of redundant chemicals from a storage in
Kalulushi (EUR 0.13 million), and support to EMF (EUR 0.07 million). Remarkable delays in
selection of contracts for NDF-financing and in procurement of works were followed by fairly
acceptable pace implementation of the contracts. However, due to financial and time constraints,
the actual removal of redundant chemicals could not be implemented as planned. Furthermore,
the extent to which uranium tailings had been spread around in Kitwe came as a surprise to
ZECU. Despite major additional works approved and volumes of materials removed under the
NDF-financed contract, it was not possible to even confirm with full certainty if all the
contaminated soils had been identified, not to speak about having them removed and disposed off.
If not already attended by ZCCM-IH under their own funding, these two uncompleted tasks
should be among those of high priority in the proposed follow-on project.

Component 2 was divided to eight sub-components, the largest three being Sub-component 3 -
ECZ capacity building; Sub-component 2 - Environmental management and compliance
monitoring; and Sub-component 6 - Environmental awareness and public participation. Most of

                                              77
the sub-components were marked by delays and slow implementation. Targets could hardly (or
could not) be achieved in Sub-component 5 - Coordination and Capacity Building with Strategic
Partners and Sub-component 4 - Environmental Emergency Response System.

The closing date of the credit was extended twice, first in December 2008 until 30 June 2010 and
then again in May 2010 until 31 December 2010. Communications failure between WB and NDF
caused the NDF closing date finally being three months before the WB closing date. Some
activities under Component 2 might have benefited if NDF closing date had also been 31 March
2010.

EMF team role and position in the financial management of NDF credit has not been
unproblematic in the respect that most of the funds channeled through Special Accounts have
been for Component 2 and in practice managed by ECZ while EMF has tried to work as the
channel for disbursements from NDF and for reconciliation documentation and replenishment
requests to NDF. Almost nine months from the closing of the NDF credit, reconciliation of
Special Account expenditures for the 15 last months of the project has still not been completed.

Contracts management and supervision by ZECU team was rated moderately satisfactory until
their failure to communicate in time to NDF the need for major additional works in the contract
for removal of AMCO uranium tailings in Kitwe. Some kind of confusion in the WB team of
NDF’s (parallel financing) role and requirements apparently contributed to this failure. (NDF
finally agreed to provide retrospective no objection to an exceptionally big contract addendum.)

Performance of ECZ team is also rated below satisfactory mainly due to slow implementation of
Component 2. This was in the hands of ECZ team and largely independent from performance of
other actors so much of the delay is attributable to ECZ.

After active cooperation in the early stages of the project preparation and implementation, the
World Bank team participation in selection of contracts for NDF-financing, support to NDF in
procurement reviews and monitoring of implementation of the NDF-financed sub-components
and contracts became rather limited. This caused serious delays to procurement of works and
services under Component 1. From 2008 communication between the World Bank and NDF was
almost non-existent for a couple of years, then briefly resumed early 2010 to collapse again until
end of ICR stage.

Frequent and fast changes in the person of NDF Manager responsible for the project caused
fractionation and inconsistency in the monitoring and supervision functions of NDF. Especially
the structure of Component 2 was too complex for NDF’s limited resources to manage and
supervise adequately. Initial monitoring support provided by a consultant financed by IDA was of
great value to NDF but was discontinued after 2007. At that stage, both the Bank and NDF failed
to strenghen their teams with necessary expertise.
