                         contracting a new study, carrying out a study trip and advancing with the project activities financed with local resources, the Borrower defined the details of five pilot projects and
                         started the respective bidding processes. It is expected that these pilot projects will be completed before loan closure at the end of December 2011. Therefore, in principle the project

                         development objectives will be largely achieved. Since the Borrower has been financing a number of project activities with local resources, part of the loan amount will be canceled.
