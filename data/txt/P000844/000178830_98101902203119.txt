INTERNATIONAL DEVELOP MENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR A FIRST HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Ghana for the equivalent of US$13.0 million on
standard IDA terms to help finance a project for the rehabilitation of
about 345 miles of trunk roads and preparation of further road rehabili-
tation works.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The last IBRD Economic Report (R72-223, October 3, 1972) drew
attention to the structural problems of Ghana's economy. It described,
in particular, the imbalances on external account and in public finances
which have characterized the economy in recent years. Country data are
given in Annex I.
3.        On external account, the problem has been a persistent failure
to reduce dependence on cocoa exports or to develop domestic production of
import substitutes. Cocoa still accounts for about 70 percent of merchandise
exports. With slow-growing world demand and widely fluctuating world cocoa
prices, the balance of payments situation remains highly unstable.
4.        On public finances, there has been a persistent tendency for
budget current expenditures to rise at a rapid rate and to outstrip
budget revenues which are overly dependent on cocoa export duties and
import taxes. In addition to the imbalance in the government budget
per se, there are a large number of public agencies and enterprises whose
activities have not been subjected to adequate economic tests, and which
have remained dependent on budget support or easy access to bank borrowings,
This imbalance in public finances and the generally high conswuption orienta-
tion of the economy have eroded potential savings and produced strong
inflationary pressures.
5.        In describing these basic problems, the last report concluded
that, even with vigorous and determined policies on the part of the Govern-
ment, the necessary structural adjustments could only be effected gradually.
Nevertheless, favorable external developments and government policy action
over the past year have led to some progress in laying the basis for a more
secure and sustained development.



6.        Preliminary estimates for 1972 1/ indicate that, largely as
a result of restrictions imposed by the Government, the level of imports
was reduced by about 35 percent below the 1971 level. This seems to have
been achieved without yet creating any major shortages or bottlenecks in
the economy. However, the high level of stocks held at the end of 1971
was an important contributing factor.
7.        Merchandise exports increased by about 7 percent in 1972.   While
this increase in exports was in large measure due to favorable world cocoa
prices, which rose from about US cents 24 per lb at end 1971 to US cents 38
per lb at end 1972, gold and timber exports also increased significantly.
8.        As a result of the heavy retrenchment of imports and improved
export earnings, there was a trade surplus of US$155 million in 1972 com-
pared to a deficit of US$28 million in 1971. With the cut in imports,
net payments on freight and insurance as well as on investment income
account also registered a sharp decline. Furthermore, following the
Government's February 5, 1972  announcement on debt, there were no service
payments on the very sizable medium-term supplier credits contracted before
February 1966. The result was an apparent overall surplus of about $140
million in 1972, and after payments to the IM1' and to several countries on
bilateral trade agreements, central bank net reserves went up b-y about
$125 million during the year. World prices for Glana's principal exports
remained favorable during the first seven months of 1973.
9.         Unlike previous years, the balance of payments surplus in
1972 has been used to build up reserves and to repay some short-term debt
($33 million during January-June 1973) rather than to permit a rapid ex-
pansion in imports. At the same time, a bonus scheme ias encouraged non-
traditional exports with success in expanding exports of textiles and
cocoa beverages.
10.       Provisional information on the likely out-turn of the government
budget for 1972/73 (fiscal year ending in June) indicates higher-than-estimated
receipts from cocoa export duties and continued improvements in personal income
and company tax collections.  Recurrent expenditures have been kept close to
the original budget target, and in contrast with previous years there has been
no significant slippage in development expenditures. As a result, the overall
budget deficit for 1972/73 is likely to be kept down to about ¢70 million, which
would be in line with the original budget estimates. Another favorable develop--
ment has been the sharp cut-back during the second half of the fiscal year in
the expansion of bank borrowing by the extra-budgetary state enterprises and
agencies.
1/ A more precise analysis of recent balance of payments developments is
impeded by the sharp turn around in "errors and omissions" which changed
from a positive position of $14 million in 1971 to a negative $60 million
in 1972. When more final estimates of imports, trade credits, arrears on
current payment, direct investment, etc. are available, the large fluctuations
in the item "errors and omissioad'may be more adequately explainable. Pre-
liminary estimates for 1972 balance of payments are therefore subject to
these limitations.



- 3 -
11.       From April 1972 to April 1973, money supply (including quasi-money)
expanded by about 20 percent, compared to arn increase of 33 percent in the
corresponding period a year earlier. This monetary expansion appears to
have resulted in somewhat more moderate price increases than had been anti-
cipated in the last Bank economic report. Preliminary indications are that
the cost-of-living index for 1972 was about 11-12 percent above the level of
the previous year. However, the main buffer between the considerable monetary
expansion and actual price increases has been the rapid build-up of liquidity
in the banking system (saving and time deposits increased substantially in
1972). Thus, there remains a latent, serious inflationary pressure which points
to the need for a further tightening in monetary and budget policy.
12.       Reliable information on overall production developments in 7972 is
still not available. The "Operation Feed. Yourself" programu had a favorable
effect on certain food crops, but its full effects remain to be determined,
and there is evidence of difficulties in the storage and distribution of the
expanded food supplies. With the substantial decline in imports, the supply
of goods to the economy is unlikely to have expanded in 1972, and the growth
of GDP has probably been only about 2 percent in real terms.
13.       While therefore there has been some improvement in Ghana's economic
Derfonrance, a solution has still to be found for the external debt problea.
Significant progress has been made in this direction since the sugar rehabili-
tation project was approved by the Executive Directors last December. In
late July a first meeting was held in Aecra between the Government of Ghana
and representatives of sone of the creditor Governments to prepare the wa-y for
full-scale discussions later this year.  Tne possibility of having fraitfiul
direct discussions on the debt issue in the fall depended upon Ghana's oroposing
a formula for its review of the contracts which gave rise to the disputed
medium-tens debts, contracts which the Government has reserved its right to
challenge on the ground that some of them have been shown to be "tainted and
vitiated by corruption and other forms, of illegality", while in other cases
"there has been a fundamental breach of contract on the part of the contractors"
Such a formula was presentec to the creditors in mid-September which naow removes
the major obstacle in the way of further talks. Accordingly, the creditors
Rave proposed a new date for the continuation of talks in which the Government
of ahana had previously indicated its preparedness to participate.  From our
review of the questions raised in the creditors' counnunication and from sub-
sequent discussions with the Ghanaian authorities irn early October, we can
reasonably expect substantive negotiations to begin before the end of 1973,
14.       Meanwhile, the Ghana Government is currently engaged in negotiations
with certain foreign firms over its acquisition of a 55 percent interest in
foreign-owned extractive industries in accordance with a decree issuaed last
December.  The Government issued a further statement in January 1973 anmouncing
its intention to negotiate participations ranging from 20 percent to 55 percent
in the equity of other foreign -owned enterprises, and negotiations with respect
to some of these participations hLave also begun.
15.       No meaningful assessment can be made of Ghanars creditworthiness for
external borrowing pending a settlement of the debt and compensation issues,
and no Bank lending to Ghana is contemplated at tne present time.  The further



- 4 -
IDA operation now proposed can, however, be justified by the improvement in
the economic situation, which is directly attributable in part to changes in
government policy, and by Ghana's readiness to enter into direct discussions
on meaium-term debt with its creditors.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN GHANA
16.       The Bank Group has lent Ghana US$100.5 million, of which US$47 million
was a Bank loan for the Volta dam and associated infrastructure in 1962.   The
remainder has been lent since 1968 for power, cocoa, waver supp`y and sewerage,
fisheries, highway design and sugar rehabilitation. Annex II contains a
summary statement of loans and creaits as of August 31, 1973 as well as notes
on projects in execution. Tnere are no major problems in these activities
with the exception of the fisheries project (Credit 163-GH).
17.       As indicated in the last economic report, Ghana is facing the major
task of restructuring its economy. The Government's appreciation of this
is clearly manifested in its efforts to achieve greater self-sufficiency
in food and to spread agricultural development more widely.   Bank Group support
of this objective will entail stronger emphasis on the agricultural sector,
as reflected in the sugar rehabilitation project approved in December 1972.
Proposed cotton, livestocl; oil palrr. and rice projects will be given particular
emphasis in future Bank Group lending.   It also will be important to improve
the Agricultural Development Bank which coula serve an important function
in the Governmentis new agricultural program.. Projects in wnich the Bank
Group participates will focus on institution-buildirLg and training of Ghanaian
nationals as a basis for further improvements in project preparation and greater
competence in project implementation.
18.       In infrastructure, future Bank Group activity will remain substantial
but should gradually decline as joint financing with other donors develops.
The public utilities with which the Bank has been cooperating are functioning
well and should increasingly be able to attract financing from a number of
bilateral sources. Except for the new field of telecommunications, future
infrastructure projects are likely to be mainly follow-on projects in line
withl growth oI demand for water, power and sewerage.
19.       The Bank has also appraised water supply and telecommunications
projects. The first project entails a proposal to increase water supply to
the Accra/Tema metropolitan area and adjacent rural sections, following on the
successful execution of Credit 160-GH. Further, a project has been prepared to
meet Ghana's more pressing telecommunications requirements, including the reha-
bilitiation of exchanges and long-distance facilities, expansion of local



exchange caapacity, and extension of long-dictance and telex networkse
Co-financing arrangements for the latter two projects are now being
discussed with other aid agencies.
20.       The Bank Group's share in Ghana's total external debt is small
(about 10-11 percent) in relation to other lenders, but it was approximately
20 percent of long-term official debt outstanding at the end of 1971.
Bilateral commitments of external assistance just before 1972 totalled just
over $50 million per annum. In the future, Ghana will not only need to
reach a satisfactory settlement of the medium-term debt problem cited in
paragraph 13 above. It also must mobilize substantial resources for its
development. There are some prospects for further diversification of the
sources of external aid. The Consultative Group, if it can be reactivated,
should facilitate the enlistment and coordination of this assistance, in-
cluding co-financing arrangements.
PART III - TTh41ISPO0TAT-I0-N IN GHAINA
21.       Ghana's transnort infrastructure caln support a hilher level of
Juture eco-omic activity if there i. ormt rehabilitation of some fast-

28        rThe proposed project is based on the conclusions of economic and
enrinneering stubdies by Scott, W4i]son, Kirkpatrick and Fartners (S.;?;T) whose
services were obtained under UJK financing.  SWKP's study of some

the negotiation of a contract for const.ruction supervision with SWK P.
37.       The road Dnprovements envisaged in the project will reduice high
operating costs on the roads preserntly in disrepair.  They should facilitate
more efficient and increased agricultural production. The analysis of all
road sections indicates a weighted average economic return of
about 22 percent for the total rehabilitta.on and improvement works.

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION1
Loan No. 618 - Electric Power; US$6.0 million Loan of June 23, 1969;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1973
This project included the installation of the final two gener-
ating units at Akosombo Power plant and expansion of its transmission lines.
The project was executed effectively and the new facilities are now in oper-
atione
Credit No. 160 - W4ater Supply and Sewerage; US$3.5 million Credit of
August 28. 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1974
This project comprised the extension of water distribution sys-
tems in the Accra/Tema metropolitan area and improvement of Accra's sewer-
age system. These works are substantially completed, approximately on sched-
ule and at estimated cost. The credit also included the improvement of the
organization and operations of the national authority responsible for Ghana's
water supply and sewerage sector. The Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation
is now functioning with significantly improved management and satisfactory
financial performance. The original Closing Date of June 30, 1973 has been
extended to June 30, 1974 in order to permit retention funds for contrac-
tors' services to be paid.
Credit No. 163 - Fisheries; US$1.3 million Credit of September 25, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31! 1973
This project was to have provided for (a) the construction
of forty purse seiners; (b) credits to fishermen for purchasing such ves-
sels; (c) fishing harbor improvement and expansion studies; and (d) the
improvement of the Ghana Industrial Holding Corporation's Boatyard Division.
Implementation of the project has been substantially delayed for all phases
except the fishing port studies.
At the outset, problems arose concerning the design and price of
the proposed boats which caused initial delays and necessitated further in-
vestigation. It was found that the original concept of the fishing vessel was
no longer financially viable due to decreased catches and prices of landed
fish, exacerbated by increased costs. Instead, it was determined that fit-
ting the project boats with larger engines with dual purpose rigging (in
order to extend the fishing season) could be viable provided the number of
boats was restricted in line with known fish resources. On this basis,
the Bank and Government agreed to reduce the number of boats involved in
the project to ten vessels from the original fortye All ten have been
sold; six have been completed and delivered to fishermen and the remainder
should be finished in two months.  All procurement for these vessels is
virtually completed.
lThese notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particu'lar to report any problems
which are being encountered, ard the action being taken to remedy them. They
should be read in this sense, ind with the understanding that they do not
purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
proiect execution.



ANNEX II
Page 3
In May 1972, the Government suggested that the balance of the
Credit, approximately US$4oo,o00, be reallocated to rehabilitate three
high-seas vessels not now fully operative and to refit an additional trawler.
It was not possible to achieve an agreement on this matter. The project was
recently cut short for various reasons and Government has agreed to cancel
the remaining proceeds of the Credit except for those funds required to complete
procurement in process and the port studies.   IDA meanwhile is discussing with
the Government a thorough reexamination of the fisheries sector and identification
of further investment needs for a possible second activity.   The original Closing
Date of December 31 , 1972 was extended to December 31,v 1973.
Credit No. 205 - Cocoa Rehabilitation; US$8.5 million Credit of
June 26, 1970. Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The project, principally involving the rehabilitation and re-
planting of 87,000 acres of cocoa plantings, is proceeding quite well.
During the first year of field work, the replanting targets were met with
excellent nursery practices. Control of swollen shoot virus disease is
similarly well ahead of project requirements. However, the Sahelian
drought caused a reduction in the acreage of the 1972/73 replanting
campaign to 56% of the target. Lower annual replantings in the future
are likely in addition. An extension of the project period by one year
on this account is contemplated. The rehabilitation component of the
project previously postponed is now underway. 2,000 sprayers have been
ordered and should be delivered this month.
Credit No. 256 - Power Distribution: US$7,1 million Credit of June 21,
1971: Closing Date: June 20, 1974
The project is intended to further expand Ghana's power
distribution network. It should be completed on schedule late in 1973.
Due partly to the economic stagnation in Ghana, sales of electricity
have not increased as much as forecast and the Electricity Corporation
is proposing rate increases.
Credit No, 354 - Sugar Rehabilitation: US$15.6 million Credit of
January 29, 1973; Closing Date:  March 31, 1979
Work on the project is proceeding satisfactorily. HVA Inter-
national has been assisting Ghana Sugar Estates Ltd. in the operation
of the two sugar factories and estates, including preparations for the
plantings in May-June 1973, Similarly, two advisers from Berenschot
Bosboom are in Accra working with the Agricultural Development Bank (ADB)
in accounting and credit control. The Sugar Industry Committee has been
established and ADB has written off its unrecoverable debts, A recent
supervision mission found that sugar production in the first full milling
season is estimated to be higher than originally forecast, Both sugar
factories are now being overhauled, but progress is relatively slow.
