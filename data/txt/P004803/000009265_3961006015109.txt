MEMORANDUM AND RECOHMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOMNT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND
FOR A LAND TITLING III PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan to the Kingdom of Thailand for the equivalent of US$118.1
million to help finance a Land Titling III Project. The lo&n would be at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 17 years, including
five years of grace. The project would be cofinanced by a AUD7.2 million (US$6.3
million equivalent) grant from the Australian International Development
Assistance Bureau (AIDAB).
2.        CountrylSector Background.  About 801 of Thailand's population live
ln rural areas, most of them depending directly on agriculture.  Agriculture
provides over 602 of employment but its contribution to the overall econo1i7 has
been steadily declining, as reflected in 1992 in its 121 share of GDP (against
251 in 1981) and 301 of exports.   During 1960-75, the sector performed
exceptionally well and was able to achieve annual growth rates exceeding 5Z.
Since 1975, the rate of growth of total domestic agricultural output has fallen
progressively and in 1990, turned negative. Forest land has also been severely
encroached. Although 401 of the total area of the country has been proclaimed
as forest land, only 181 remains still relatively untouched.
3.        As area expansion is no longer poss4ble, agricultural development must
rely on increase of farm productivity. However, the switch to higher-velue
agriculture necessitates capital investment in land improvements. Financial
institutions provide medium and long term credit only against collateral, usually
land which is covered by a full title deed. Thus, the millions of legitimate
land owners who are still awaiting title deeds have little access to such credit.
The limitations which this poses on potential farm investment and productivity
improvement are significant f^- the national sconomy.
4.        The Royal Thal Government (RTG) is unable to tax real property
effectively, due to the lack of accurate cadastral maps.  In addition, revenue
collectico from land transaction fees and local taxes is affected by low
valuations made by the Central Valatation Authority (CVA), a division of the
Department of Lands (DOL).   As these are also used for compensation of
ex-propriated private property, fair and equitable compensations to property
owners are not being provided. The institutional capacity for an effective
national valuation function is inadequate.
5.        To address these concerns, the Government enacted a Land Code in 1954
to consolidate prior land laws and establish a legal framework for a land
administration sy tem designed to control land use, determine ownership, and
generate revenues from land. DOL vas strengthened to implement the system, but
by the 1970s the demand for land titling had increased sharply, exceeding DOL's
capability. As an interim measure, DOL issued land use certificates, which are
now being converted to title deeds. To speed up title issuance, in 1984 the
Government initiated a 20-year Accelerated National Cadastral Mapping and Land



- 2 -
Titling Program. The first and second phases were supported by th. Bank under
Land Titling I and II Projects (Ln. 2440-TH and Ln. 3254-TH), with AIDAB grant
cofinancing for technical assistance and training.
6.        LTP I covered Bangkok and 9 provinces in the north and northeast, and
LTP II an additional 30 provinces mainly in these two regions.   Project
activities included cadastral surveying and mapping, issuance of title deeds,
improvement of land administration, strengthening of DOL and CVA, and technical
assistance and training. LTP I focused on the introduction of new technology,
while LTP II concentrated on its consolidation and on laying down the framework
for institutional changes. The PCR of LTP I concluded that the project had
substantially achieved its objectives (79Z of eligible parcels issued with
titles). Decentralization of land administration from province to branch office
level was successful, providing the public with more efficient and effective land
administration  services.   Government reveaues from land transaction fees
increased cor.siderably as a direct result of the project.   Cofinancing of
technical assistance and training by AIDAB played a critical role in the success
of the project. Socio-ecc'omic studies completed for LTP I have shown that land
values, access to institutional credit, amounts borrowed per family, use of farm
inputs and income, and cultivated areas significantly increased due to titling.
These studies have confirmed results obtained from previous Bank-financed studies
on the direct correlation of land values, farm investment and productivity with
land tenure security. LTP II is still underway. Land titling activities are on
track, and technological innovations introduced under LTP I have been
consolidated. Pilot projects in land and management information systems have
been successfully tested, while a strategic plan for the development of a
national valustion function has been prepared.   These activities would be
implemented under LTP III.
7.        Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations.   A review by the
Environment Department of Bank experience with rural land titling projects
reported that, except for the Thailand projects, the 12 operations surveyed
performed poorly. The main problems were: lack of political support; conflicting
bureaucratic priorities; lack of institutional capacity or support; and complex,
multiple objectives, of which titling was only an adjunct. By contrast, the
Thailand projects were relatively successful, due to: full political and
institutional support; focused titling objective; Government commitment of
adequate resources; and relatively favorable land policy environment. Effective
technical assistance and training were also factors.   Experience from the
Thailand projects showed that their clear success needs to be sustained by long
term institutional changes, including improvements in administrative and
management practices, human resource management and development programs, and
integration of national land use and classification policies.   The proposed
project addresses these issues.
8.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The project is a central part of the
country assistance strategy for Thailand, which focuses on four areass
infrastructure  development;  poverty  alleviation  and  improving  income
distribution; human resource development; and environmental and natural resource
management. The project addresses the last three areas. The Thailand Poverty
Assessment of June 1993 reported that Thailand was the only country out of six
in East Asia that failed to make significant advances in reducing poverty in the
late 1980s, despite the economic boom. Also, 95? of employed household heads who
are below the poverty line are in agriculture, and 28? of farming families



- 3 -
nationally fall below the poverty line of US$173 per capita.   Regional
differences are also widening, with poverty incidence in the northeast remaining
unchanged and the highest at 332. Through provision of secure documented land
tenure to mainly rural families (and over 502 of the project provinces are from
the poorer northeast region), the project would assist in alleviating poverty of
the least privileged people in the country by opening access to institutional
credit and thus increasing farm productivity and income.   To ensure the
sustainability of technical and institutional capacity, the project will support
a comprehensive human resource management and development program for DOL.
Project support to ground survey and demarcation of forest boundaries in the
project area, which includes over 25% of the country's provinces, will represent
the first comprehensive initiative by the Royal Forest Department (RFD) to
clearly delineate its forest areas and provide a sound basis for enforcement of
forest protection.   In addition, project support to the Land Development
Department (LDD) for the demarcation of steeply sloping land is a first
comprehensive Government effort to ensure that vulnerable watershed areas are not
issued with title deeds. Finally, due to resource constraints, the Government
still requires external assistance to enable it to complete the national land
titling program on an accelerated schedule. The project will *±.lp to fill in the
resource gap.
9.        Pro1ect Obiectives.  The project aims to provide secure land tenure
to eligible land owners, develop the long term sustainability of DOL' a
institutional capacity, improve land administration service delivery, and develop
an effective national property valuation function.
10.       Proiect Description.  The five-year project would support the third
phase of the Government's Accelerated National Cadastral Mapping and Land Titling
Program. It would mainly cover some 19 provinces, including 10 provinces in the
northeast, 7 provinces in the north, and 2 provinces in the central region. The
project components are: (a) land titling, including rural and urban cadastral
survey and mapping, parcel adjudication, and title deed production and
distribution (681 of total base costs); (b) improving DOL service delivery,
focusing on decentralization and strengthening of land administration (1OZ of
total base costs); (c) strengthening DOL, with emphasis on ma- ement and
development of human resources and information systems (10 of total base costs);
(d) developing CVA, through implementation of the first phase of CVA's strategic
plan (91 of total base costs); and (e) provision of technical assistance,
training and studies (32 of total base costs).
11.       Proiect Implementation.  The proposed project would be carried out by
DOL. The project cost is estimated at US$206.8 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$46.8 million equivalent (23Z), including taxes
and duties estimated at about US$9.4 million equivalent. The total external
financing required is US$124.4 million, of which the Bank would finance US$118.1
million equivalent (771 of the foreign exchange and 512 of the local costs), and
AIDAB an equivalent of US$6.3 million. A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A.   Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements,  and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule D.   A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operationo in the Thailand are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 12866-TH dated August 30,
1994, is being distributed separately.



12.       Project Sustainability.  One of the project's main ob5ectives is to
ensure the long term sustainability of investments and improvements made in land
administration under LTP I and II by supporting institutional changes, focusing
on human resource management and development, and improvement of administration
and management practices.
13.       Aereed  Actions.    The  following  assurances  were  provided  at
negotiations: (a) by January I, 1995, DOL, RFD, and LDD would appoint joint
survey teams to carry out forest boundary demarcation; (b) DOL would, by January
1, 1995, formulate and implement a policy to address during the field
adjudication process issues of deceased and absentee landowners and parcels held
in mortgage; (c) DOL would, by January 1, 1995, formulate and implement a policy
for improving provincial and branch land office records management; (d) DOL
would, oy October 1, 1995, submit to the Bank an appropriate human resource
management and development program; and (e) DOL would, by October 1s 1997,
prepare an implementation plan for the continued development of CVA from project
completion to full development.
14.       Environmental Asiects.   The project has a "B" rating, but the
entironmental impact is expected to be positive. The physical demarcation of
forest and watershed area boundaries aims at ensuring that titling is not carried
out inside those areas. Cles2 boundaries agreed by all concerned RTG agencies
vill provide a sound basis for implementation of forest protection. Secure land
tenure and a freely transferable title deed provide the incentive for asset
capitalization through land improvements and for protection against degradation
due to unsustainable land use practices. Land titling activities near forest and
watershed boundaries will be closely monitored to prevent accidental titling
inside forest areas.
15.       Prosraom  Obiective  CateRories.    The project  supports  the main
objectives of poverty alleviation, natural resource kanagement and human resource
development. Accelerated land titling aims at poverty alleviation by providing
title deeds to legitimate private and predominantly rural land owners, thereby
opening the way for them to in_.itutional credit and to land Improvements and
increased productivity. The clear demarcation of forest and protected watershed
area boundaries is an important step in environmental and natural resource
management. Finally, the project's human resource development activities are key
to the sustainability of land administration.
16.       Project Benefits.   An estimated 1.1 million predominantly rural
families from amongst the poorest sections of the population would directly
benefit from the project by receiving some 3.4 million title deeds. However,
these benefits do not lend themselves to conventional rate of return analysis.
The evaluation of LTP I showed that increased security of tenure led to higher
land values and easier access to institutional credit, increased input use end
on-farm investments, higher productivity and beneficiary incomes, and increased
government revenues. Other benefits include the various outputs of the project
(e.g. land titles, aerial photomaps, cadastral maps), which can be used by other
development agencies, and more accessible, efficient end timely land
administration service to the public. Environmental benefits are also expected.
The Troject will finance socio-economic and environmental impact studies to
measure project impacts on these parameters.



17.       Risks.  There are no project risks, as the pr,ject would be the third
phase of a successful national program. Government is strongly committed to
supporting this program by providing adequate re ourcos, and the necessary
experience has been gained under the first two phases to address adequately any
unforeseeable implementation problems.
18.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed lean would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.
