1. THE SECTOR
Energy Use and Resources
1.01      In 1976, Honduras per capita energy consumption ranked second lowest
among the six nations of the Central American isthmus (Panama ranked highest,
with a consumption of 914 kg of petroleum equivalent per capita, compared to
Honduras' 354). The country uses four primary energy resources. petroleum,
hydro power, wood/charcoal and bagasse. The Economic Commission for Latin
America (ECLA) estimates that gross energy consumption in 1976 amounted to
about 1,115,000 tons of petroleum equivalent (TPE) of which 44% was provided
by petroleum products, 13% by hydroelectric power stations, and the balance
from non-commercial sources. All liquid fuel requirements are currently met
by imports of reconstituted crude, refined in the Texaco refinery at Puerto
Cortes. The role of hydro power has grown rapidly since 1970 and will expand
further with the recently completed Rio Lindo power plant extension, the
Nispero Power Project and the proposed El Cajon hydro power project. However,
Honduras will still continue to be heavily dependent on fuel imports.
The table below shows the historic change in consumption patterns, including
the substantial relative increase in hydro power use.

1.03      Domestic energy resources are not fully known.  Government and
private efforts are focussing on exploring for coal in central and western
Honduras and for petroleum and gas offshore in the Caribbean. However,
exploration so far has not identified deposits on a scale that could ensure
their commercial development. Other alternative sources of energy are also
being studied. Areas which appear to have potential for geothermal devel-
opment are being evaluated. The country's forests may represent an addi-
tional energy resource to be more fully tapped. The Corporacion Hondurena de
Desarrollo Forestal (COHDEFOR) has proposed to use for fuel the wood waste
produced by the country's sawmills. A recent study by independent consultants
(Chas. T. Main, U.S.A.) suggests that modern methods of pelletizing wood waste
would make steam power plants economically feasible. The 1982-1985 generation
addition study, currently under way (para. 4.04), is to consider this alternative.
1.04      Honduras' most abundant and known energy resource is hydraulic power,
which is believed to have a potential of 4,000 MW and an annual production
capacity of about 35,000 GlWh (present annual needs are about 600 GWh). This
theoretical potential was calculated on the basis of total runoff at average
total head to a sea level reference.  About one third of this potential has
already been inventoried, and sites aggregating about 2,000 GWh annual pro-
duction have been studied at feasibility level, including the proposed El
Cajon (about 1,350 GWh per year) Project on the Humuya river.  The proposed
Borrower, Empresa liacional de Energia Electrica (ENEE), plans to update
shortly the existing inventory and to prepare a prefeasibility study of the
most promising site 1/ for potential development after completion of El Cajon.
1/   Currently assumed to be the Piedras Amarillas site on the Patuca river.

Both studies will be financed by Loan 1629-HO (Nispero Power Project). ENEE
is also studying possible small hydroelectric projects to expand the options
available for future supply of isolated areas.
Energy Sector Organization
1.05      The Consejo Superior de Planificacion Economica (CONSUPLANE) 1/
lays down the broad objectives of national energy development for the National
Development Plan. The Government agencies active in the sector are the
Ministry of Natural Resources (fuel resources and refinery supervision),
Ministry of Economy (petroleum distribution and pricing), Ministry of Public
Works and Communications (transport companies), Corporacion Hondurena de
Desarrollo Forestal--COHDEFOR (wood/charcoal producers), and ENEE (electricity
supply). However, there is no central entity in Honduras to plan energy
policy, and adequate statistics on energy use by sectors of the economy are
not available. Also, Government staff responsible for the energy sector need
training.
1.06      To handle these problems, in March 1979 the Government created an
advisory body to the Executive Power, which has now recommended the creation
of a Ministry of Energy or a National Energy Commission, as well as further
institutional measures to strengthen the sector. An agreement has also been
reached with UNDP to carry out a sector review and provide training of sector
officials as part of UNDP's Central American Energy Program. The review would
study Honduras' prospective energy demand and supply patterns, as well as
alternative sources of energy. Particular emphasis would also be placed on
the design and implementation of an energy information system which should
greatly enhance the ability of the Government to develop policies for the
sector.
Development of the Electricity Sector
1.07      Prior to the creation of ENEE in 1957, supply of electricity in
Honduras was provided by isolated private and municipal systems relying
chiefly on diesel generation. Tegucigalpa was served by Empresa de Agua y
Luz, a government company San Pedro Sula--by the Public Utility Honduras
Corporation, a company with foreign capital participation, Puerto Cortes, La
Lima and Tela--by Tela Railroad Co. (a subsidiary of United Brands); and La
Ceiba--by Standard Fruit Co. Other towns had mainly municipal or simply no
electricity service.
1.08      At present all major cities and towns are served by ENEE through
the national Interconnected System, which uses hydroelectric generation mainly.
With the electric energy sector of Honduras being entirely the responsibility
of ENEE, no other entity takes part in new service extensions or regulation
of the sector. ENEE's role has been achieved through gradual acquisition
of the municipal and private companies. Only a few small installations
remain to be absorbed in the near future.
1.09      The planning of the electricity sector of Honduras is the respon-
sibility of ENEE and in particular of its Planning Division, which draws up
1/   Economic Planning Council.

the detailed investment programs. The planning and technical studies for
these programs are contracted with specialized consulting firms. Currently,
the quality of planning appears adequate.
Bank Group Participation in the Power Sector
1.10      The Bank Group has made seven loans and two credits to the electric
power sector, totalling US$110.5 million and providing a substantial part of
ENEE's financing requirements. The last three projects are currently in
execution. The last loan (1629-HO)--US$30.5 million--for the Nispero Power
Project, consisting of 52.5 MW generating plant, distribution expansion,
studies, and training, was declared effective on April 12, 1979. The major
equipment components have already been ordered and bidding for the other
components and other project execution is in progress. A small delay (about
4 months) in project completion is currently expected.
1.11      The Sixth Loan (1081-HO)--US$35 million--of January 27, 1975,
financed the 46 MW extension of the Rio Lindo hydroelectric plant, distri-
bution system improvements, rural electrification, studies, and training.
The Sixth Power Project is about 90% completed and the Rio Lindo plant ex-
tension was placed in full operation in March 1978, about four months ahead
of appraisal schedule. With the completion of the Rio Lindo plant extension
the main objective of the Sixth Power Project has been met. The CABEI-financed
distribution works have been delayed about two years, now to be completed,
with a larger scope, during 1981. The Bank-financed part of the project, as
originally defined, did cost less than estimated at appraisal because of lower
steel prices for the long penstock/pipeline and lower price escalation than
assumed. The Bank has agreed that the saved funds be used by ENEE to finance
the extension of 35 kV lines (additional to those already included in that
project) to serve areas without electricity west of the Interconnected System.
These lines will also connect the Nispero hydro-electric plant and the area of
Santa Rosa de Copan with several villages to ENEE's system. CABEI's part of
the Sixth Power Project has also been amended, to provide for increased ENEE's
transmission system needs through 1981. With these additions, a larger Sixth
Power Project would be completed by 1981, two years later than estimated at
appraisal.
1.12      Over 90% of the Fifth Power Project (Loan 841-HO of June 28, 1972--
US$12.3 million--providing funds for 26 MW of diesels, an interconnection
line to Nicaragua, a load dispatch system, studies and training) has been
successfully completed. ENEE was unable to agree with Instituto Nacional de
Energia (INE) of Nicaragua to jointly contract consulting services to design
the load dispatch and communications systems. ENEE has contracted independently
for such services for an expanded load dispatch and communication component to
provide for its system control needs through the 1980s, including those of the
proposed El Cajon Project. For the expansion, the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) Special Fund is providing US$1.7 million. The 138
kV lines for the supply of the Aguan Valley (originally included in the
Fifth Power Project) have been deleted, since USAID is now financing a compre-
hensive rural electrification project for the Valley (para. 1.25). The
modified Fifth Power Project is now expected to be completed in mid-1981.



1.13      The four earlier projects--with loans/credits totalling US$32.7
million--have been successfully completed. Together they provided for
(a) 94 MW thermal and hydro power generation additions, including the first
two stages of the Lake Yojoa-Rio Lindo hydroelectric development (30 MW
at Canaveral and 46 MW at Rio Lindo); (b) transmission expansion (particularly
under the Fourth Power Project); and (c) distribution expansions. The Project
Performance Audit Reports for ENEE's Third and Fourth Power Projects (Sec.
M75-411 of May 30, 1975 and Sec. M78-489 of June 5, 1978, respectively)
indicate that both projects were implemented without noteworthy problems
and that the purposes of both projects were fully achieved. The major lesson
derived from these projects is that ENEE's load forecasting required improve-
ment. This problem and minor weaknesses mentioned in the Reports (ENEE's
need to continue training programs, improve administrative efficiency, and
reduce accounts receivable) have been addressed in the Nispero Power Project.
1.14      Further participation by the Bank Group in helping the Honduran
energy sector development would be aimed at: (a) reducing the dependence of
the econoray on imported fuel through construction of projects using indigenous
energy resources; (b) improving the organization and planning capability
in the energy and power sectors; (c) further strengthening the efficiency
of ENEE and assisting in the expansion of its system; (d) improving inter-
sectoral planning capacity so that ENEE investments in power would relate more
than presently to projects in other sectors (water management, agriculture,
industry); and (e) promoting integration of the Central American power systems.
1.15      Cooperating with the Bank in the development of the Honduran power
sector are other lenders and technical assistance agencies: USAID is lending
for rural electrification; CABEI--for distribution; IDB, several bilateral
aid agencies, and CABEI are expected to cofinance the El Cajon hydro power
project; and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) is inter-
ested in financing the future transmission additions to connect El Cajon to
ENEE's system. klso, ECLA is preparing an interconnection study of the Central
American isthmus with the assistance of consultants (Montreal Engineering
Co.--MIONENCO--of Canada). As a complement to the El Cajon Project, IDB is
considering to extend a separate Technical Cooperation Loan for a study on the
comprehensive development of the Humuya and Sulaco river basins, part of whose
hydraulic resources will be regulated by tne El Cajon dam. The specific
objectives and the scope of the work would be determined by a short-term
consultant specializing in this type of study, who would prepare the terms of
reference.
Electricity Consumption and Access to Service
1.16      Between 1967 and 1977 ENEE generation grew at an average annual
.rate of 15.1%, while CDP grew 4.0%. The resulting annual growth rates for
generation per unit of GDP and generation per capita were 10.6% and 12%,
respectively. Annual net generation per capita (about 178 kWh in 1976)
remained low compared with other Central American countries: Costa Rica
(762 kWh), Nicaragua (385 kWh), El Salvador (262 kWh), and Guatemala
(162 kWh). About 70% of ENEE's load is industrial-commercial which con-
tributes to the high annual system load factor of about 65%.



- 6 -
1.17      Access to electricity is available only to about 22% of the total
population, living mainly in urban centers in the more densely populated part
of the country. This is about double the access of 11% during 1968. Overall,
ENEE is supplying electricity to about 600,000 people (about 75% of the
inhabitants of the areas served). Only 5 out of 26 towns supplied have a
higher percentage of population served: San Pedro Sula (96%), Puerto Cortes
(85%), Santa Barbara (83%), La Ceiba (77%), and Tegucipalga (76%). Even
though most of the population lives in small population centers in remote
areas, and a large effort will be needed to provide them with electricity in
the future, ENEE expects to make electricity available to about 37% of the
total population by 1986. By 1983 alone, the number of costumers is expected
to increase to about 181,000 as a result of the distribution facilities and
rural extensions being built and those included in the Nispero Project.
1.18      To increase the number of electricity users, ENEE has the following
policy:
(a) A low monthly minimum bill of US$1.25 has been established,
which gives the customers the right to use up to 20 kWh. I/
This price makes electricity competitive with other sources
of lighting available to the smallest customers.
(b) A connection policy is being applied under which new
customers will not be charged a connection fee whenever
the cost of connection is less than US$150. When this
amount is exceeded the customer may amortize, without
interest, the excess over a 24-month period.
(c) Based on the policy described in (b), new population
centers which request a connection are not charged if
the cost of the connection averages less than US$150
per customer connected. Otherwise, the excess may be
amortized over a 24-month period.
National Electrification
1.19      ENEE concentrated during its initial years on serving the major
urban centers, thus obtaining a sound financial position. In 1971, a rural
electrification program was drawn up, based on a review of 23 potential
market areas. Six priority markets 2/ close to the Interconnected System
were selected for development. With Bank Group financing, ENEE has built
about 270 km of 35 kV rural lines and related distribution facilities in
these areas. ENEE is now undertaking the electrification of the Aguan Valley,
where the Government is implementing an extensive program for the development
of the area. In addition to agro-industry and sawmills, the Aguan Valley
Rural Electrification Project will benefit 25,000 low-income families. About
610 km primary 35 kV and 550 km of secondary distribution lines, 200 km of
138 kV transmission lines, five 138/35 kV substations totalling about 26 MVA,
and 20,000 meters will be installed with the help of a US$10 million USAID
loan and ENEE/Government counterpart funds of US$5.6 million.
1/   About 20% of ENEE's customers fall into this category.

Cortes and Yoro; Atlantida; Yoro and Colon; and Comayagua and La Paz.



- 7 -
1.20      Undertakings in connection with the Nispero Power Project will
extend ENEE's Interconnected System into western rural areas now partly
supplied by isolated systems (with the largest at Santa Rosa de Copan).
Extension of the interconnection to these areas will bring service to about
17 villages over some 132 km of 35 kV lines and supply about 5,500 households
initially (about 25,000 mostly low-income people). Loan 1629-HO for the
Nispero Power Project provides funds for preparing a new National Electri-
fication Plan for the mid- and long-term (para. 4.05).
Tariff Levels and Structure
1.21      By law ENEE has the right to set its own tariffs.  At the end of
1974, R.W. Beck & Associates (USA) completed a tariff study based on accounting
costs. This study recommended substantial increases in the tariffs for various
service categories (particularly the large consumers, at that time with fixed-
price contracts) and a general increase in basic tariffs levels, averaging
25%. It also recommended the application of a fuel-cost adjustment clause
designed to compensate for changes in the cost of fuel. As a condition for
Loan 1081-HO, the proposed increase was put into effect in February 1975. The
fuel adjustment clause was implemented in 1977 when fuel costs increased
notably in the operating cost mix. Since then ENEE has increased its tariffs
twice, in June 1978 by 10% and in MIay 1979, by 12%. Present tariffs are shown
in Annex 1, Tables 1-1 and 1-2. Average revenues and rates of return over the
past ten years are discussed in para 5.04. In US cents per kWh sold, the
average revenues were 3.72 in 1973 and 4.93 in 1978. Most of ENEE's 1979
tariffs fell within Central American averages. However, for large industrial
consumers above 100,000 kWh monthly (corresponding to 195 kW demand at a load
factor above 70%), ENEE's tariffs were about the lowest in the region; commer-
cial tariffs were also low.
1.22      In 1978, ENEE engaged Societe Francaise d'Etudes et de Realisation
d'Equipements Electriques (SOFRELEC--France) for a study of ENEE's power
tariff structure based on long-term marginal cost criteria. This study,
already completed, was financed by Loan 1081-HO. The study confirms that the
present tariff structure favors large industrial consumers. Based on it, ENEE
has prepared a satisfactory program for tariff structure revision and has
already placed orders for the metering equipment required.
Constraints on Sector Development
1.23      The major constraints at the energy sector level are the lack of
sector information, coordination and expertise in policymaking. The UNDP-
sponsored exercise would help find solutions to alleviate the country's
dependence on imported fuel (which will continue to remain high to the mid-
1980s) through increased exploration of energy resources.
1.24      Within the power sector, ENEE will have to continue its efforts
to increase and strengthen the staff in order to undertake its very large
expansion program. The Organization and Management Study (para. 2.04), and
the training combined with the reinforcement of ENEE management (paras. 2.02,
2.10 and 4.08) provided through the proposed Project, would assist these
efforts.



1.25      The large financial requirements of the El Cajon Project and possible
future large hydro power projects which would follow it immediately, could
place a heavy financial burden both on ENEE and the economy. Should the
financial requirements of such projects increase substantially above those
now projected, shortage of funds would slow the implementation of a National
Electrification Program. Over the longer term, financial requirements might
be reduced through greater reliance on regional interconnection of the national
power systems of the region. The ECLA interconnection study (para. 1.15) is
proceeding well after initial delays resulting from the need to arrange
financing. It is expected to be completed in early 1980; its results should
provide a framework for planning future generation expansion in the six
countries covered, over the next five years.
1.26      The remoteness and dispersion of rural population centers, com-
bined with their rather low level of productive activity and income, will
continue to handicap the extension of electricity service to them because
they have limited prospects of becoming economically viable.

2. THE BORROWER
Legal Structure
2.01      The borrower of the Bank loan 1/ would be the Empresa Nacional de
Energia Electrica (ENEE), an autonomous public utility owned by the Govern-
ment of Honduras. ENEE was created in 1957 as a result of the merger of
Empresa de Agua y Luz de Tegucigalpa, then an agency of the Ministry of
Development, and several utilities which operated isolated systems. Water
supply, for which ENEE was originally also responsible, was transferred
to a newly created autonomous institution, Servicio Autonomo Nacional de
Acueductos y Alcantarillados (SANAA), in 1961.
2.02      During project appraisal, agreement was reached on the need to
expand ENEE's Board membership, incorporating the President of the Central
Bank and the linister of Finance both of whom have had, and will continue
to have, direct participation in the financing arrangements for the project.
The amending decree (April 1979) provides that, in addition to the two
officials mentioned above, the Board shall be composed by the Ministers of
Communications and Public Works, of Natural Resources, and of Planning and by
a representative from the private sector. This change should speed up the
decision making and government clearance processes, improving ENEE's efficiency.
Organization and Mlanagement
2.03      ENEE's management is entrusted to a General Manager assisted by
four Deputy Managers, respectively responsible for (a) Administration/
Finance, (b) Operation, (c) Engineering, and (d) Construction and Special
Projects. There is also an Economic Planning and Project Analysis Division
which provides staff function support to the General Manager. The current
organization chart is shown in Annex 2, Figure 2-1.
2.04      Further strengthening of ENEE's and middle upper management is,
however, required, particularly for building the El Cajon Power Project. ENEE
has engaged Arthur D. Little (USA) to carry out an Organization and Management
Study with financing from Loan 1629-HO. The study is now underway. The
consultants first partial report, covering the organizational arrangements for
the Project, has been reviewed by the Bank. Its recommendations on the
subject are reflected in the organizational arrangements made.
2.05      Special organizational arrangements are being made by ENEE for the
Project (Annex 2, Figure 2-2), since neither ENEE nor its staff have had
experience in the construction of hydroelectric projects the size of El
Cajon. A Project Unit having an appropriate mix of expatriate and local
staff has been set up under a Director reporting directly to ENEE's
General MIanager. In view of ENEE's limited experience with very large civil
1/   The Borrower for the IDA credit would be the Government which would
onlend the proceeds to ENEE.



- 10 -
works, the Project organization also includes an Engineering Mlanagement
(Technical) and a Financial Advisor to the Project Director, in addition to
the engineering consultants' and the engineering consulting board (paras.
4.14-4.16). Both advisors have already been appointed and will participate in
bid evaluation and contract negotiations. Agreement has also been reached
with ENEE on: (a) the timetable for organizing the Project Unit and engaging
other key personnel for Project execution 1/, and (b) maintenance, during
Project execution, of an adequate Project Unit whose key staff would be
satisfactory to the Bank.
Staffing
2.06      As of October 1978, ENEE had 1,543 employees in operations, with a
ratio of 1 employee per 71 customers served. ENEE has been able to steadily
improve this ratio despite substantial increases in its service area (in 1973
it had 1 employee per 54 customers served). Of ENEE's staff about 4% are
professionals, 7% technicians, 21% non-professional administrative employees
and 43% are skilled and 24% unskilled laborers. The Organization and Management
Study will examine in depth staffing requirements, particularly at top and
middle management levels especially with a view to ENEE's projected rapid
growth rates.
2.07      ENEE has followed the policy of maintaining competitive salaries
for higher level staff. General salaries are negotiated with a strong company
union; the present labor qontract expires at the end of 1980, it provides for
annual wage increases averaging about 7.5% per year 2/.  To ensure that ENEE
will pay salaries sufficient to attract suitably qualified personnel (especially
taking into account the limited breadth of the local market) ENEE agreed with
the Bank to request its external auditors (Price, W4aterhouse & Co.) to update
a salary study taking into account the special needs of the El Cajon project. 3/
The results of this update generally confirm that professional salary levels
are adequate and agreement was reached on further compensation policy measures
for certain personnel categories, as recommended by the study.
Training
2.08      ENEE has given considerable attention to training its staff.  It has
sent approximately 100 technical and administrative staff abroad for this
purpose and has also received technical assistance from utilities in Europe,
the Republic of China, and North and South America. The foreign cost of the
1/   Engagement of a financial administrator for the project has been made
a condition of loan effectiveness.
2/   In October 1979, the union requested an additional wage increase of 30%
to cover recent cost of living increases. After intensive bargaining, the
union settled for an increase averaging about 12%, effective January 1, 1980.
3/   In March 1977, ENEE's external auditors submitted a salary evaluation
study for ENEE's management and professional staff. In general, ENEE's
salaries were then found to be in line with the market.



- 11 -
programs was and is mainly financed by Loans 841-110, 1081-Ho and 1629-HO. To
establish further training needs, a survey of ENEE's occupational structure
and a proposed training program were completed in November 1977 by the Instituto
Nacional de Formacion Profesional (INFOP) with assistance from the International
Labor Organization. The survey included a job evaluation in all ENEE depart-
ments and identified areas where training is required. ENEE is implementing
INFOP's recommendations by setting up a training center in Tegucigalpa and
organizing two programs with financial assistance from the above loans, to
train staff to serve as assistant electricians and to provide literacy training
for all ENEE employees who have not completed primary school.
2.09      Several institutions are assisting ENEE's training efforts.  ENEE
places middle level technical and office staff in special training courses
offered by INFOP. ENEE's staff receives training in design and construction
of transmission lines, maintenance and operation of hydroelectric power
plants and geotechnical and hydrological techniques at the United States
Bureau of Reclamation. Comision Federal de Electricidad (Mexico) trains
ENEE's staff in operations and maintenance techniques, especially hot line
maintenance of transmission and distribution lines and safety procedures. The
Taiwan Power Company has sent a group of specialists to Honduras to train ENEE
staff in the following areas: (a) small hydroelectric and multipurpose
projects; (b) power system planning; (c) power system operation; and (d) diesel,
gas turbine and hydroelectric power plant maintenance.
2.10      W4hile the Project does not include special funds for a training
component, substantial training benefits will result to ENEE during Project
execution. The Project engineering consultants, Motor Columbus (MIC), would
establish a training program for ENEE's counterpart professionals, in the
main engineers, as assistants to the consultants' specialized professional
field staff (para. 4.16). ENEE engineers would also assist MC, at its head-
quarters in Switzerland, in the preparation of construction drawings and
detailed engineering for El Cajon. Other training by the consultants will
focus on construction supervision of civil works and erection of equipment,
instrumentation systems for the dam and the underground powerhouse, and factory
inspections during fabrication of goods for the Project.
Management Systems
2.11      ENEE's management systems are reasonably satisfactory; and manage-
ment consultants have been engaged, with Bank financing under prior loans, to
improve them. In 1974, R.W. Beck and Associates (Beck-USA) was engaged to
develop computer systems for billing, payroll, inventories and general
accounting purposes and, as of 1977, the whole accounting process has been
computerized. Presently, ENEE prepares monthly income and budget control
reports and is developing methods to improve data quality and speed of pre-
paration. ENEE also operates a computer model for financial planning, pre-
pared for them by 'IC.



- 12 -
2.12      Since 1976, ENEE, based on Beck's recommendations, has been intro-
ducing a Management by Objectives system, but has met with difficulties
in achieving a higher degree of delegation of responsibilities. This is one
of the issues which the Organization and Management Study (para. 2.04) is
addressing. ENEE has agreed to exchange views with the Bank on the recommenda-
tions of the study and its proposals for putting them into effect by October 30,
1980 (December 31, 1979 under Loan 1629-HO), to introduce such changes in
these proposals as the Bank may reasonably request, and to implement them
starting not later than March 31, 1981.
Accounting and Audit
2.13      ENEE's accounts are kept in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. The accounting code is based on the United States
Federal Power Commission Uniform System of Accounts. Internal control is
carried out by an internal audit unit which reports directly to the Board
of Directors and also provides services to the General Manager. Previously,
the scope of the work of this unit had been limited. ENEE's external auditors
have recently prepared an internal auditing manual, and ENEE has been engaging
the staff required to enable the internal audit unit to perform effectively
its functions as specified in the manual.  The internal audit unit is now
fully operational.
2.14      ENEE's external auditors (Price, Waterhouse, and Co.) work has been
satisfactory.  ENEE has agreed to continue presenting financial statements,
audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, within four months
after the end of each fiscal year.  During negotiations, agreement was
reached on the scope of additional information to be included in the audited
financial statements 1/, as well as on changes on the presently agreed
method of asset revaluation (para. 5.05).
2.15      The Comptroller General of the Government of Honduras carries out
an additional audit of ENEE's operations, which includes an annual management
review.
Commercial Functions
2.16      ENEE is currently engaged in improving the management of its com-
mercial functions. Based on the recommendations of a recent study by Beck,
ENEE has created a commercial division under the Deputy Manager for
Administration/Finance and appointed the Division Chief. The Bank and ENEE
have agreed on a program for the full implementation of the consultants
recommendations and on the timetable for the program.
2.17      Despite the shortcomings stemming from the previous lack of central-
ized control of its commercial functions, ENEE's billing and collection expe-
rience has been generally satisfactory. Bills for electricity are distributed
1/   Such information has already been submitted for FY 1978.



- 13 -
monthly and must be paid within 15 days. Payment may be made at ENEE's
offices, which are somewhat lacking in adequate facilities, or through banks.
As of December 31, 1978, gross accounts recei.vable from electricity consumers
represented about 65 days of sales. ENEE maintains a reserve for bad debt
losses which it increases annually by 1% of the total billings to the private
sector. The reserve is judged to be adequate.
2.18      Implementing a provision of the Guarantee Agreement for Loan
1081-HO, ENEE signed an agreement with SANAA for the payment of SANAA's
overdue accounts. This agreement is being complied with satisfactorily.
ENEE's collection experience with governmental and other public sector agencies
is generally satisfactory, although in the past problems have arisen with
collections from municipalities. To allow ENEE's collection experience to be
monitored during project execution, the average collection period for public
sector receivables has been included in the project performance indicators.
Insurance
2.19      ENEE has insured its fixed assets against various risks.  It does
not engage, however, in any form of risk analysis nor is it presently admin-
istratively staffed to do it. Present insurance coverages represent about 11%
of the revalued cost of fixed assets, and seem insufficient vis-a-vis normal
figures ranging between 25% and 40%. Consequently, ENEE agreed (under Loan
1629-HO) to engage consultants to review its policy on insurance and to imple-
ment, after discussion with the Bank, the resulting recommendations. Their
report is now expected by April 1980. It has been agreed, therefore, to
change the date for implementation of the agreed recommendations from Septem-
ber 30, 1979 to September 30, 1980.
2.20      Given its presently limited expertise in the field of risk manage-
ment, ENEE has engaged a specialized insurance consultant (Sedgwick, Forbes,
Inc., UK) to determine the most suitable insurance coverage for the Project
during and after construction. Sedgwick Forbes has provided advice on the
handling of responsibility and insurance matters in the contract signed with
the project consultants, as well as on the tender documents.

3.   THE MARKET AND MEANS TO MEET IT
Market History and Characteristics
3.01      The Honduran economy expanded by an average of about 4% annually
in real terms during 1963 to 1973, followed by no growth in 1974-1975 because
of the damage from hurricane Fifi to agricultural production capacity and
a drought in mid-1975. The economy rebounded sharply in 1976-1978, when
the annual GDP growth rate was about 7.4%. During these periods, ENEE elec-
tricity sales grew at average annual rates of 23% in 1963-1973, 15% in 1974-
1975, and 14.6% in 1976-1978. Annual electricity sales growth by major ser-
vice area during 1965-1977 is shown in Table 3-1. 1/ The trend of sales for
the Interconnected System by major consumer category is given in Table 3-2. 2/
3.02      The table below summarizes the history of annual generation, demands,
load factors and coincidence factors. Recently, the annual load factor has
varied from 61.7% in 1972 to 67.4% in 1974 when it was exceptionally high
because the annual maximum demand was depressed as a consequence of hurricane
Fifi. System losses (in transmission and distribution) ranged from 11.0% to
15.5% during 1967-1977; they were about 14.3% in recent years.

69 kV lines. The 138 kV system is arranged in a ring (Rio Lindo, La Puerta,
Bermejo and El Progreso substations) to which the two lines to Tela/La Ceiba
and to Canaveral/Siguatepeque/Comayagua/Tegucigalpa area/Pavana/Nicaragua are
radially connected (see Map). The line linking ENEE to the Nicaraguan power
system has been built for future 230 kV operation. There are 10 major trans-
mission substations with a total installed capacity of about 562 MVA, 221 MVA
to transform to subtransmission level (at 69 kV and 34.5 kV) and 202 MVA to
distribution level (34.5, 13.8, 4.16, 2.4 kV).

Forecast of Requirements
3.04      The outlook for Honduran economic growth is favorable for the mid-
and long-term. Basic agricultural and related production capabilities are
expanding rapidly and export volumes have been increasing significantly.
Honduras has a relatively low foreign debt ratio compared with other Latin
American countries. Continuing inflows of development capital are expected to
assist in the financing of investment requirements. A relatively high level
of economic growth is expected during 1978-1983. For 1979-1983, it is
presently estimated that the average annual growth rate of real GDP may be
about 5%, which would be above the 1960-1965 average of 4.3%
3.05      Based on recent market studies, generation requirements in the
Interconnected system are expected to grow at a rate of 11.7% per annum
during 1979-1988. The load forecast used for the appraisal of this Project
was prepared by EBASCO in mid-1976, in connection with a System Optimization
Study (para 6.01). The forecast was revised and updated in July 1978 by
Montreal Engineering Co. (MONENCO) in connection with the ECLA regional study;
both forecasts are reasonable for the mid- and long-term. The MONENCO forecast
is marginally lower as the comparison in Table 3-4 shows. But, as both fore-
casts assume a relatively higher growth in the initial years than recent
experience would lead to conclude, the appraisal is based on a more gradual
growth until 1985. 1/ The sales forecast, as adjusted by the appraisal
mission, is shown in Table 3-4.
Program to Serve Forecasted Market
3.06      ENEE's total power and energy requirements to 1995 are shown in
Table 3-5. The earliest feasible date to meet the requirements in the
Interconnected System from the proposed El Cajon Power Project would be in
1986. To avoid rationing of electricity, ENEE has programmed the addition of
30 MIW of diesels in 1982 and of 22.5 MW in 1983; this is essentially based on
the study by EBASCO. However, a more detailed feasibility study should
establish if such additions represent the least cost solution (para. 4.04).
1/   EBASCO's and MONENCO's forecasts included the analysis of economic and
social factors which can be expected to influence the country's long-term
electricity requirements. The factors included historical rates of
economic growth and plans for future development and general economic
outlook for Honduras and its industries. In particular EBASCO's sales
forecast attempted to take into account (a) the price elasticity of
demand of electricity, (b), the possible application of incremental
(marginal) rates, and (c) the impact of irrigation loads. EBASCO analyzed
in detail ENEE's sales records for 1966 through early 1976, together with
economic and demographic data, and held discussions with knowledgeable
government and industry officials, other economic and business information
sources and major ENEE customers. In addition, correlations between the
growth of the economy and ENEE's energy sales were developed by EBASCO
and MONENCO and econometric forecasts were made, based on assumed future
economic growth rates.



- 17 -
3.07      A balance of peak load and annual average load (energy) vs.
supply for the period 1979-1988 is shown in Tables 3-6 and 3-7, indicating
acceptable reserve margins through 1989, when ENEE's next major project
would have to be commissioned (unless arrangements can be made for import-
ing electricity from other Central American countries). The annual supply
available from El Cajon was estimated by MC on the basis of a three-year
period for filling the reservoir.
3.08      The basic forecasts in this report do not assume any so-es of surplus
power to other Central American countries. As shown in Table 3.7, by 1986
internal market needs will (under average hydrological conditions) practically
absorb all hydro generation capacity. Because of its large size compared
to Honduras' home market, the Government has always considered El Cajon to
be a project of regional interest. Negotiations have therefore been conducted
with both Guatemala and Nicaragua with a view to selling any possible surpluses
available during the first years of the Project's operation. A third possibility
for placing surplus power would be sales to Costa Rica through Nicaragua. 1/
However, the most obvious market would be Nicaragua which is already intercon-
nected with ENEE's system. Discussions had been underway between ENEE and INE
(formerly ENALUF) for some time. The recent civil war and major political
changes in Nicaragua, however, have delayed the decisions at the highest
levels of government required to arrive at concrete arrangements.
3.09      The most promising market for sales to Guatemala would be in that
country's Atlantic system, which is presently isolated from the main intercon-
nected system and which relies entirely on thermal power. In 1977, the
Government of Guatemala indicated preliminary interest in the possibility of
interconnection between the Guatemalan interconnected system and Honduras.
However, purchases from El Cajon would require substantial transmission
investments and supply from the main Guatemalan system might be more economical.
The Guatemalan utility, Instituto Nacional de Electrification, INDE, agreed
under Loan 1605-GU (Chixoy Project) to carry out a study of the transmission
requirements for connecting the Atlantic system to its main interconnected
system. This study could provide a useful basis for a decision by the
Guatemalan Government regarding possible purchases from Honduras.
3.10      In view of the above discussion, there would be substantial advan-
tages to neighboring countries from purchasing any hydroelectric energy
produced in ENEE's system in excess of Honduras' own requirements. The main
uncertainty associated with such exports relates to the future course of
events in Nicaragua, which will affect the growth of the power market in that
country and its willingness to cooperate in transfers with Honduras and
between Costa Rica and Honduras. As noted in Chapter 6, export sales are not
necessary to justify the construction of El Cajon. They could, however,
be financially significant if the internal market fails to expand at the
forecasted rates.
1/ The economic feasibility of an interconnection between Costa Rica and
Nicaragua has been established, and financing for the project has been secured.

4. PROGRAM AND PROJECT
Background and Objectives
4.01      ENEE's construction program for generation plant additions through
1985 is appropriate to meet the demand for electricity in Honduras which is
expected to continue to rise rapidly. The curtailment of electricity supply
which would result if El Cajon and the other facilities of the program were
not built on time would be costly to the economy, it would set back industrial
growth and delay extension of public electricity service to new areas as well
as connection of low income consumers within the existing system.
4.02      The program is summarized below and detailed in Annex 5, Table 5-6.
El Cajon accounts for over two thirds of total expenditures planned through
1985. The program's cost was estimated by ENEE, its consultants and the
appraisal mission on the basis of generally prevailing prices during the
third quarter of 1979, and takes account of revised Project cost estimates
as of the same date. Program and project financing are discussed in paras.
5.10-5.16.
4.03      The proposed El Cajon project, discussed in detail in Attachment
4-1, 1/ and summarized in para. 4.07, was prepared over the past decade by
ENEE and its consultants. El Cajon was originally identified in a 1967 hydro
power survey of Honduras. A Project feasibility study was completed by Motor
Columbus (MC) in 1973, and updated in December 1977. In addition, EBASCO
carried out studies (financed by a Technical Cooperation Loan from IDB) of the
Project's size and timing in connection with a system optimization review.
The reports and documents for the above studies supplied the basis for a field
appraisal of the Project by a mission in October/November 1978. 2/
Generation
4.04      All of the future increases in the demand of the Honduran Inter-
connected System for electric energy are expected to be met by ENEE. It
currently has an installed generating capacity of about 200 MW, with an
annual production of 915 GWh of firm energy (977 GWh of average year energy),
sufficient to provide supply through 1979 and, with the addition of the 30
MW Puerto Cortes diesels in 1980 and the 22.5 MW Nispero hydro power plant in
1981, through 1982. To study El Cajon's timing and possible joint development
of the Honduran and Nicaraguan power sectors and define the projects that
should be programmed to enter service in the period 1983 to 1988, ENEE, with
financial assistance from IDB, engaged   the consulting firm of EBASCO Service,
Inc., New York (EBASCO). For ENEE's independent development, EBASCO's study
shows that the addition of medium speed diesels for the period after 1982 and
before commissioning the proposed El Cajon hydroelectric plant in 1985/1987,
is the optimum development alternative. The study also shows that for the
combined ENEE (Honduras)/INE (formerly ENALUF, Nicaragua) systems, the earliest
possible construction of
1/   Attachment, Table and other references in this section refer to Annex 4
unless noted otherwise.
2/   A post appraisal mission took place in October 1979.



- 19 -
El Cajon would have been justified since sales of Honduran surplus electric
energy to Nicaragua, using the existing ENEE/INE interconnection line,
would have offset the economic costs of advancing El Cajon to the earliest
possible date. In any case, prior to completion of El Cajon ENEE would have
to install about 52.5 MW of generating capacity to provide for the growth in
demand during 1982 to 1985. The present program is based on installation of
additional diesel units. The precise nature and timing of the capacity to be
installed would be determined on the basis of a feasibility study for the
generation development program for the 1982-1985 period to be completed by
external consultants (Chas. T. Main), and submitted to the Bank by July 31,
1980. ENEE and the Government' are expected to discuss the results of this
study with the Bank under the arrangements covering major investments described
in para. 5.21. From 1986 until about 1989 the output of El Cajon (292 MW, and
about 1,348 GWh annually) would provide an ample supply of electricity for
Honduras.
Transmission and Distribution
4.05      ENEE's program to expand its transmission and distribution system
in the period to 1984 includes the 138 kV line from La Ceiba to the Aguan
Valley with the associated stepdown substations and 35 kV distribution and
subtransmission lines, 69 kV lines to connect the Puerto Cortes diesel plant
and 35 kV lines to the west of the Mochito mine to connect the Nispero and
Santa Rosa de Copan areas to the main inter-connected system, stepdown sub-
stations at El Progreso, Canaveral, Pavana, Suyapa, San Lorenzo, Choluteca,
Villanueva, Tegucigalpa area, and La Ceiba, with related reinforcements of
the distribution systems, and normal expansion of distribution systems in
areas served.
ENEE has agreed to revise this program in light of the recommendations which
would result from the National Electrification Masterplan updating study
which it will prepare under the Nispero Power Project. This study would also
verify the best and most economical bulk transmission system for the delivery
of El Cajon output to the load centers and confirm its final cost. For the
purposes of this appraisal El Cajon has been assumed to be connected by
two 230 kV lines each to the El Progreso substation in the San Pedro Sula area
and to the Suyapa substation in the Tegucigalpa area. ENEE and the Government
did agree that the transmission facilities required for the Project will be
constructed and completed by August 31, 1985. The Canadian Government has
expressed its interest in principle in financing the lines.
The Project
4.06      The proposed Project, described in greater detail in Attachment
4-1, consists of the El Cajon 292 MW hydro power plant on the Humuya river,
near the confluence with the Sulaco river, and related consulting and other
services as described below. El Cajon would produce 1,051 GWh of firm energy
in a dry year and 1,348 GWh in an average year.



- 20 -
4.07      The El Cajon Power Project will consist essentially of the fol-
lowing components. A concrete arch dam with a maximum height of 225 m and a
crest length of 382 m. The dam will include 3 bottom outlets, each with a
capacity of 630 m3/s and a crest spillway for 2,700 m3/s. An intake struc-
ture and two inclined pressure shafts convey the water to an underground
powerhouse with four 73-MW Francis turbine and generator units and auxil-
iary equipment and thence through four 75 m long tailrace tunnels to the
outlets. Ancilliary works include about 60 km of access roads, a switching
substation, a diversion tunnel, and overtoppable upstream and downstream
cofferdams. A reservoir will be created having a surface of 94 km2 and a
maximum storage of 5.65 x 109 m3, of which about 74% would be live volume.
4.08      The main objectives of the Project are to:  (a) increase the gener-
rating capacity of ENEE to meet the demand for electricity projected for the
period beyond 1986 and reduce, in its early years, fuel consumption in thermal
generating plants; (b) contribute to the control of floods in the Sula Valley; 1/
(c) regulate the flow of the Humuya river downstream of the dam, thus enabling
future irrigation projects there; and (d) strengthen ENEE's organization and
management by on-the-job training of its staff as counterparts to the profes-
sional staff to be provided by the consultants for the Project.
Project Cost
4.09      The cost of the Project 2/--excluding interest during construction
and other financial charges--is estimated (based on third quarter 1979 prices)
at the equivalent of US$493.2 million including provisions for physical
contingencies and for price escalation. A summary, by major categories, is
shown below.

- 21 -
4.10      These estimates are reasonable.  They are based on an analysis by
Jacobs Associates Construction Engineers (USA) of the civil works 1/ costs and
construction program provided in the bid level designs of MC for El Cajon and
have also been reviewed by Mr. Ralph Bloor, an engineering consultant engaged
by the Bank. MC had obtained suppliers' pro forma quotes for the steel
hydraulic structures, and the turbines and generators with accessories.
Except for the erection of electromechanical equipment, labor--together with
the purchase of land--was considered to be a local cost, as was 24% of the
diesel fuel and gasoline cost (which would be purchased from local distributors).
The estimates do not include taxes or customs duties, as ENEE is exempt from
such payments.
4.11      Provisions for physical contingencies, in view of the advanced
status of engineering for the Project are about 15% for major civil works and
5% for the provision of equipment, engineering during construction, and other
items. Price contingencies were calculated using annual inflation rates of
12% in 1980, 10% in 1981 and 1982, and 8% in 1983 and 1984 and thereafter 7%.
4.12      The cost of project engineering, supervision of construction and
administration has been estimated for expatriate staff on the basis of the
bid submitted to ENEE by MC and of an estimate of the costs of the services of
the Consulting Board (para. 4.15) and of the Technical Advisor. For local
staff the cost was estimated in detail using adjusted local rates. The work
force required to complete the Project engineering and administration has been
calculated to aggregate 1,455 expatriate and 9,240 local staffmonths. The
average foreign consultant base line cost (excluding travel and subsistence)
is US$8,500/staffmonth.
Project Engineering and Execution
4.13      ENEE will retain MC for further consulting services to maintain
continuity in Project engineering. A new contract, has been signed for
Project procurement, final engineering and design, administration and super-
vision of construction and testing.
4.14      An independent Consulting Board 2/ with suitably qualified members
reports to ENEE's General Manager and meets periodically to review progress
and major project issues. The Board's services and those of the Engineering
Management (Technical) Advisor and the Financial Advisor (para. 2.05) would be
financed by the proposed loan/credit.
4.15      As described in para. 2.05, ENEE is establishing a Project Execution
Unit. At its headquarters in Tegucigalpa, ENEE will take all major decisions
and coordinate the activities of all groups, including those related to
environment and resettlement and of the Consulting Board and the various
administrative offices giving support to the Project. At its headquarters in
Baden, Switzerland, MC, as consultants, will prepare the detailed final design
1/   Bids for the civil works were opened on October 31, 1979.  The lower
bids are in line with Jacobs' estimates. Bid award is scheduled for
March 1980.

under its own project director who will coordinate all field and headquarter
activities of the consultant teams, technical departments and its own special
board of consultants. At the Project site, an MC team with ENEE counterpart
staff will be responsible for the supervision and construction of the Project
under the consultant's resident chief engineer. He will coordinate four
specialized subgroups, for civil works, electromechanical equipment, planning
and coordination, and administration of site activities.   ENEE agreed to
retain satisfactory consultants (including an independent Board of Consultants)
during Project execution and to consult with the Bank before making any
substantial changes in these arrangements.
4.16      The El Cajon project studies and designs, prepared by MC under a
project preparation loan from CABEI, provide a realistic basis for estimating
technical characteristics, Project timetables and detailed costs. The Project
construction schedule (Figure 4-1) prepared by Jacobs Associates is reason-
able and takes into account the need for detailed design and engineering,
coordinated administrative and construction procedures and engagement of a
limited number of contractors and suppliers of goods and services. It should
be noted that the designer of the Project (MC) has estimated, and continues
to believe in the validity of, a somewhat shorter construction schedule
(5.6 years vs. 6.3 years used for the appraisal). Bid documents are expected
to be issued and major contracts awarded as shown in Table 4-1. Final con-
struction designs will be prepared during the course of the Project for
delivery to the contractors, manufactures and suppliers as needed. Using
critical path analysis methods, it is estimated that the last El Cajon unit
will be placed in operation in August 1986. To meet the completion date, the
contract for the civil works for the dam (the major critical item) should be
awarded in March 1980. The Bank's comments on the draft bid documents for the
underground powerhouse (Lot No. 1) and dam (Lot No. 2) were taken into account
by ENEE. MC has also submitted draft bidding documents for the steel hydraulic
structures, turbines, generators, switchgear, transformers, high voltage cables,
high voltage switchyard, auxiliary services, local control equipment, and
telecommunication equipment. These items (except for switchyard equipment)
will be financed and bid as shown in the next paragraph.
Procurement
4.17      The cost estimate is based on what Jacobs Associates considers to
be an optimum procurement packaging. This includes erection of the steel
hydraulic structures (which are expected to be financed by suppliers' credits)
and all other electromechanical equipment and transport of the turbines and
generators in Honduras by the general contractor of the civil works for the
dam (which is Bid Lot No. 2). All construction items of the Project--except
for land, access road to the site, environment and resettlement--would be
packaged and procured under competitive bidding as follows:

both lots.
/f   International Competitive Bidding (ICB) consistent with Bank Group Guide-
lines.
/g   Competitive bidding among suppliers willing to provide financing.
Lots No. 1 and 2 were bid simultaneously in order to attract a large number of
proposals from the prequalified international contractors and to obtain lowest
possible combined bids for the large civil works package. The prequalified
firms are acceptable to the Bank and to IDB. The civil works for Lots No. 1
and 2 represent critical path items and amount to about 85% of physical
project costs. The balance represents the purchase of the hydraulic structures
and electromechanical equipment (to be financed by suppliers). Honduras is
presently not a member of the Central American Common Market; therefore,
regional preferences will not apply. None of the goods included in the Bid
lots (No.1 to 6 and 10 to 12), included in the Project except for cement
(para. 4.18) are expected to be available from Honduran manufacturers. A 15%
domestic preference margin would be applied to the cost of cement delivered to
the Project site based on cif-Honduras port or ex-factory of the local cement
plant.
4.18      The bidding documents for the civil works provide special arrange-
ments for the purchase of cement, of which approximately 430,000 tons 1/ are
needed:
1/   Of this amount, it is expected that about 85% would have to be delivered
in 1984/85.

(a) The civil works contractor for Bid Lot No. 2 is required to
place annual contracts for cement supplies as needed; these annual
contracts are to be subject to international competitive bidding
consistent with World Bank guidelines for procurement, and subject
to Bank review before award.
(b) Payments for cement supplies would be made against documentary
evidence.
(c) The civil works contractor would remain responsible for logistics
and quality control of cement supplies.
These provisions should ensure reasonable competition for cement supply. They
also relieve the contractor from the uncertainty which might otherwise prevail
with respect to future cement supplies in Honduras. At present, there is only
one local supplier of cement, who does not have sufficient capacity to cover
these requirements in addition to the expected growth in demand by other
users. A new cement plant is expected to begin production in 1982, which
should allow local producers to supply the Project's needs. Under these
arrangements, local industry would be able to participate in the bidding.

The closing date for the proposed loan would be February 28, 1987, shortly

Coordination with Co-lenders and Project Supervision
4.21       Since a meeting of the Bank, IDB, CABEI, the Government and ENEE in
Miami in 1975, a staff of these entities and of ENEE's consulting firms and
experts have worked closely on the coordination of all aspects of the prepar-
ation and evaluation of the Project, laying a basis for continued coordination
of activities to implement the Project. Agreements for coordination and
supervision procedures have been reached, establishing the sharing of infor-
mation and services of such specialists as may be attached to the offices of
IDB and CABEI in Honduras from time to time.
4.22      The Bank, IDB and CABEI would have joint responsibility for Project
Supervision. IDB plans to employ a qualified construction engineer in its
Tegucigalpa office for following the Project closely and CABEI also intends
to supervise the Project intensively. Bank supervision missions, therefore,
would coordinate their work closely with the Honduran offices of IDB and
CABEI especially in those matters involving cofinancing which will affect the
administration of the loans.

Ecological, Environmental and Resettlement Aspects
4.23      MC's feasibility studies include a satisfactory review of the
environmental aspects of the Project and the cost estimates provide for the
necessary programs. In May 1978, the Government made an Interagency Group 1/
responsible for implementing the consultant's recommendations.  The General
Manager of ENEE is the chairman of this Group and ENEE is coordinating the
Group's activities. ENEE is currently expediting the work of the Group in
the drawing up of satisfactory programs and timetables for the various activ-
ities recommended. A detailed program, satisfactory to the Bank, has been
agreed as a condition of loan effectiveness. The detailed program should
cover: (a) the inventory of land to be flooded; (b) its acquisition; (c)
resettlement and compensation of the approximately 2,000 families affected by
the Project, including provision of means to maintain or enhance their standard
of living; (d) reservoir clearing and protection of the watershed, fauna and
archaeological treasures; and (e) a preventive health control program. The
Bank has requested for its review and comments a copy of the report ENEE's
consultants will prepare for IDB precedent to IDB's first disbursements of its
loans. This report will evaluate the actions of the agencies in the execution
of the programs and recommend further actions and passage of legislation needed
to acquire land rights for the reservoir. The Instituto Nacional Agrario (INA)
has prepared a census of the area to establish the precise number of people
living in the El Cajon basin (estimated to be about 5,000 families) and the
Bank has arranged with the Pan American Health Organization for the services
of a resettlement consultant to help ENEE and INA in the final planning,
to achieve a satisfactory resettlement with acceptable employment options
for those affected by the flooding of the reservoir.
Project Risks and Uncertainties
4.24      While ENEE has executed its recent projects satisfactorily, and
the bulk of the last one (Rio Lindo expansion--Loan 1081-HO) very success-
fully, a number of special measures (institutional, technical and financial)
will be required for the successful execution of the large and complex El
Cajon Project. Specific provisions have been taken to allow ENEE to cope with
project risks, in such areas as cost estimates, financing, management, physical
uncertainties, environment and resettlement. The economic risk of project
slippage would be small (para. 6.03) because El Cajon completion any time
during 1985 to 1987 would always result in the least-cost development; however,
the financial impact could be substantial.
1/   The Group includes:  Direccion General de Obras Civiles; Direccion
General de Salud Publica; Direccion General de Recursos Naturales;
Instituto Nacional Agrario; Corporacion Hondurena de Desarrollo
Forestal; Instituto Hondureno de Antropologia e Historia; ENEE; and
Oficina de Catastro Nacional--a total of 8 entities.



- 28 -
4.25      The Project is located on a geologically unfavorable site composed
of karstic limestone. The designers and the independent board of consultants
are fully aware of the problem and have designed the structures accordingly.
The cost estimate for the civil structures and foundation works (which account
for two thirds of the total cost) includes provision for uncertainties to the
extent of 15% over the base cost. Earthquake hazards are receiving careful
study by up-to-date methods under review by the board of independent consul-
tants. The resulting dam is likely to be as safe as modern knowledge can
achieve.
ENEE agreed to submit to the Bank detailed inspection programs covering the
dam and other Project works six months prior to their entering critical
construction phases as determined by ENEE's Consulting Board and, by
December 31,' 1983, for subsequent maintenance phase during Project operation.
4.26      The Project could be delayed if environmental activities do not
proceed within the time allocated. There is a large number of agencies that
must cooperate if progress is to be smooth, and the lenders will need to
supervise their coordination.

5. FINANCE
Introduction
5.01      Since the start of its operations, in 1957, ENEE has increased its
electricity sales and expanded its generation, transmission, and distribution
facilities at a rapid pace (para. 3.01-.02). The average annual growth rates
over the past ten years were 12% for electricity sales and 14% for generating
capacity. This expansion required a substantial investment effort, averaging
about US$19 million per year 1/, which ENEE was able to manage while maintain-
ing a satisfactory financial structure.
5.02      During the 1979-1986 period, ENEE's financial management will
be brought to test, as financing requirements will amount to about US$865
million (of which about two thirds caused by the El Cajon project). The
current financial projections (Tables 5-3 to 5-11) 2/ show that an increase to
9% from the 8% rate of return covenanted under Loan 1629-HO will be needed,
in order to maintain a reasonable contribution to investment and a balanced
financial structure through the Project construction period (para. 5.17).
At negotiations, ENEE and the Government agreed to this increase. This
will require periodic tariff increases, starting in 1980 3/. Furthermore,
substantial government funding will be required. During negotiations, the
Government agreed to make equity contributions totalling the equivalent of
US$113.2 million, 4/ in accordance with a time schedule which will be reviewed
periodically and, also, to make loans to ENEE for about US$20.5 million.
Under this scheme, ENEE's debt equity ratio (which was about 49:51 in 1978)
would rise to 54:46 in 1984; it would fall thereafter. This is acceptable.
5.03      Tables 5-1 through 5-5 show ENEE's historic and forecasted financial
statements. The former have been recast to incorporate the principle of
annual asset revaluation (to which ENEE has agreed under Loan 1629-HO) and the
latter also include revaluation of work in progress for the El Cajon Power
Project (para. 5.05).
Earnings History
5.04      Until the 1973 increase in world petroleum prices, ENEE's tariffs
--which were among the highest in Central America--enabled it to obtain a high
rate of return, in excess of the 10% covenanted under the Fifth and Sixth
Power Projects. ENEE's financial performance deteriorated after 1973 as its
dependence on petroleum fuels increased during the construction period of the
Rio Lindo hydro power plant expansion. Tariff actions taken over the period
1/   In mid-1978 constant dollars.
2/   Table and other references in this chapter are to Annex 5 unless other-
wise noted.

1980, which will become effective in March.

(a 25% increase in 1975, implementation of a fuel adjustment clause in early
1977, a 10% average tariff increase in mid-1978 and a further 12% increase in
May 1979) and the entry into operation of the Rio Lindo expansion allowed ENEE
to gradually offset the effects of the petroleum price increase. For 1979 its
rate of return on annually revalued assets is forecasted at 8%, as convenanted
under Loan 1629-HO. ENEE's tariffs and rate of return have evolved as follows:

b/   See Table 5-1, footnote (j).
5.05      For the Sixth Power Project, ENEE agreed to revalue its fixed assets
on the basis of a study prepared by independent consultants. It did so in
1975 (as of December 31, 1973) but did not, nor was it under the Loan Agreement
specifically required to, make any revaluations subsequently. For the Nispero
Power Project, ENEE agreed to the principle of annual asset revaluation, and
to incorporate the results of revaluation into its accounting records, starting
with the 1978 financial statements; this provision is being repeated under
the proposed loan. At negotiations, ENEE also agreed to annual revaluation of
work in progress, for projects which warrant it because of their magnitude and
extended construction time, such as El Cajon.
Financial History
5.06      Adjusted for the effects of inflation, ENEE's assets have approxi-
mately tripled over the past ten years, to US$275 million equivalent today,
while the debt equity ratio has improved slightly (from 51:49 to 48:52).
Government equity contributions in the period were small, so that this
development basically reflects ENEE's capacity to meet a substantial part of
its investment needs through internal cash generation. It also reflects,
however, the fact that ENEE has carried a large amount of debt denominated in
US dollars, or in currencies pegged to the US dollar and, consequently, losses
due to foreign exchange fluctuations have been small relative to the increase
in the fixed asset values produced by revaluation.

5.05       For the Sixth Power Project, ENEE agreed to revalue its fixed assets
on the basis of a study prepared by independent consultants. It did so in
1975 (as of December 31, 1973) but did not, nor was it under the Loan Agreement
specifically required to, make any revaluations subsequently. For the Nispero
Power Project, ENEE agreed to the principle of annual asset revaluation, and
to incorporate the results of revaluation into its accounting records, starting
with the 1978 financial statements; this provision is being repeated under
the proposed loan. At negotiations, ENEE also agreed to annual revaluation of
work in progress, for projects which warrant it because of their magnitude and
extended construction time, such as El Cajon.
Financial History
5.06      Adjusted for the effects of inflation, ENEE's assets have approxi-
mately tripled over the past ten years, to US$275 million equivalent today,
while the debt equity ratio has improved slightly (from 51:49 to 48:52).
Government equity contributions in the period were small, so that this
development basically reflects ENEE's capacity to meet a substantial part of
its investment needs through internal cash generation. It also reflects,
however, the fact that ENEE has carried a large amount of debt denominated in
US dollars, or in currencies pegged to the US dollar and, consequently, losses
due to foreign exchange fluctuations have been small relative to the increase
in the fixed asset values produced by revaluation.

5.07      As of December 31, 1978 ENEE's long term debt was to the following
institutions:
Amount
(US$ millions)    %
World Bank/IDA                    79.6           79
CABEI                              9.4            9
Central Bank of Honduras           8.5            8
Other                              4.0            4
101.5         100
5.08      ENEE has, from time to time, received financial assistance from the
Central Bank of Honduras, at market rates of interest. For the recently
approved Nispero Power Project the Central Bank agreed to provide up to US$4.4
million bridge financing to avoid Project delays until the Bank loan became
effective. Similar arrangements have been agreed for the El Cajon construction
period; these involve opening a stand-by revolving line of credit for an
initial amount of US$5.0 million; this amount to be revised from time to time
based on ENEE's cash budget. The present forecasts indicate that ENEE is
likely to require this facility during 1980-1986. ENEE has also agreed to
submit annual cash budgets to the Bank.
5.09      ENEE has tended to operate with a small, and on occasions negative,
working capital. Over the past few years this has become more noticeable, as
the company has been able to progressively reduce its collection periods. Thus,
ENEE has little financial margin to face unforeseen circumstances (such as
major foreign exchange fluctuations affecting its debt service payments). The
standy-by credit arrangements discussed in para. 5.08 should provide ENEE with
an additional margin of safety while allowing it to maintain fairly low
liquidity levels. To enable ENEE to use its funds in an efficient manner, at
negotiations the Government agreed to authorize ENEE to make short term
placements of funds, at rates of interest in line with its own cost of funds.
Investment and Financing Plan
5.10      During the El Cajon construction period (1979-1986), f) nancing
requirements for the Project are estimated at US$582.7 million.- Other
construction and working capital requirements result in total financial needs
of US$865.5 million. The investment and financing plan (detailed in Table
5-5) is summarized as follows:

5.11      The Bank has worked closely with ENEE in developing a suitable
project financing scheme. Approximately 95% of the foreign exchange cost
of the civil works component of the project has been, or will be, firmed
up before the proposed loan and credit are declared effective (para. 5.16).
The project financing scheme stands as follows (see Table 5-13):
(a)  Local costs (amounting to US$127.6 million), foreign exchange
costs corresponding to interest during construction not financed
by the lendors 1/ (amounting to US$68.6 million), and miscellaneous
foreign exchange costs (amounting to US$2.3 million) would be
financed from internally generated funds and from Government equity
contributions and loans (para. 5.14).
(b)  All other foreign exchange costs would be financed through borrow-
ings according to the following breakdown:

5.12      The status of the financing arrangements listed above is as follows:
(a)  The IDB loans have been approved by IDB's Board; effectiveness is
expected in parallel with the Bank loan and IDA credit;
(b)  The CABEI loan has been declared elligible by CABEI's Board;
(c)  The Japanese Government has officially notified the Honduran
Government its decision to extend an untied loan equivalent to
Y 7.8 billion; 2/
1/   The financial projections assume financing of interest during construc-
tion on the Bank loan (para. 5.17) and, partially, on supplier credits.
ENEE has already obtained letters of intent from several possible
supplier countries confirming their willingness to finance interest during
construction.
2/   At early February 1980 exchange rates, this would be equivalent to about
US$32.5 million.



- 34 -
(d) A loan agreement for US$3.5 million equivalent has already been
signed with OPEC, an increase in amount up to US$8.5 million is
presently under consideration;
(e) C.D.C. is presently appraising the project, its management has
indicated willingness to consider financing up to the equivalent
of L 5 million 1/;
(f) ENEE has received letters of intent, or other written expressions
of interest from most of the major equipment supplying countries
for the financing of turbines, generators and hydraulic steel
structures. Several of the offers involve financing on semi-
concessionary terms" 2/;
(g) Swiss commercial banks have indicated their willingness to
finance the Motor Columbus contract for engineering services.
5.13      The terms assumed, for financial projection purposes, for the
above mentioned loans are the following:
Commitment    Interest    Grace       Amortization

/a   Also carries a 1% "flat" supervision fee.  After the grace period, IDB's
loan (which would be to the Government, and onlent to ENEE) would carry
an interest rate of 2%. IDB requires, and ENEE and the Government have
agreed, that ENEE's debt service on the loan be calculated as for IDB's
ordinary loans (which bear interest at 7.5% and mature in 25 years),
the differential between this amount and the debt service to the country
is to be deposited in a fund and applied to the financing of social
projects.
/b   Also carries a 0.5% "flat" fee.
/c   These loans have already been approved by IDB's Board.
For the proposed Bank loan which would have a maturity of 20 years including
a six year grace period (para. 5.17), an interest rate of 8% per year
and a commitment fee of 0.75% were assumed for projection purposes. The
IDA credit was assumed to be onlent to ENEE on the same terms as the Bank
loan.
1/   At early February 1980 exchange rates, this would be equivalent to about
US$11.5 million.
2/ Financing terms will be taken into account on supplier-financed equipment
for bid evaluation.



- 35 -
5.14      Due to the very significant magnitude of its investment program,
of which a substantial part is caused by the El Cajon project, ENEE will
require the Government's financial assistance. At negotiations ENEE and
the Government agreed that, in order to insure a balanced financial struc-
ture, most of the required funds would be provided in the form of equity
contributions. The total amount required is estimated at US$133.7 million.
Of these, US$113.2 million 1/ would be Government equity contributions and
US$20.5 million in loans 2/ to be repaid after project completion. At nego-
tiations the Government agreed to provide its equity contributions per the
following calendar (to be periodically revised in consultation with the
Bank): 1979 US$2.5 million, 1980 US$9.0 million, 1981 US$13.2 million,
1982 US$18.0 million, 1983 US$20.0 million, 1984 US$24.0 million, and 1985
US$26.5 million.
5.15      To ensure the viability of the proposed financing scheme, Bank
economic missions frequently visited Honduras during the past year to assess
the country's ability to meet the projected debt service (including a reason-
able allowance for cost overruns), and the Government's proposals to raise
the funds required for its proposed equity contributions. The Bank also
looked into the public sector investment program as a whole and overall
Project macroeconomic effects. As a result of these analyses, in February
1980 a mission discussed tightening expenditure controls and further fiscal
measures with the Government, which declared its intention to mobilize the
additional domestic resources needed to finance prudently its ambitious devel-
opment program. The Government implemented a US$40 million tax package in
December 1979 and is prepared to raise power tariffs, reduce current expen-
diture growth and, if necessary, introduce further reforms to the tax system.
The Government is also expected to follow prudent credit policies to av 1ioa
excessive pressures on the balance of payments and on prices. Further-ore,
a three-year EFF arrangement negotiated in 1979 provides IMF resources in
support of sound overall economic and financial policies during the
implementation of the public investment program. The Government has also
requested the Bank's collaboration in conducting annual revicss of the
investment program and its financing because of tne large size of the
program, the political uncertainties prevailing in the region, and past
volatility of Honduras' export receipts due to hurricanes or price fluctua-
tions in external markets.
5.16      To ensure the firmness of the financing plan, at negotiations
ENEE and the Government agreed to the following conditions of effectiveness
on the proposed loan and credit:
1/   Of this amount US$2.5 million were already paid in during 1979.  Of the
balance, the Government expects to finance US$55 million from two long
term loans from the Venezuelan Investment Fund, of US$45 million and
US$10 million respectively.
2/   At negotiations, the Government also agreed to request an additional
US$6 million loan from the VIF which, if obtained, would be onlent to
ENEE to reduce commercial bank and supplier credit financing require-
ments.



- 36 -
(a)  all conditions of eligibility for disbursement on the IDB loans
should have been fulfilled (except for effectiveness of the
Bank loan and IDA credit);
(b)  CABEI's proposed loan shall have been approved;
(c)  the VIF first loan to the Government shall have been approved; and
(d)  satisfactory progress shall have been made on other financing
arrangements.
5.17      Standard Bank lending terms for Honduras are 20 year amortization
and five year grace. For the project an exception would be justified in
view of the long (6-1/3) years construction period, during which ENEE will
face a significant financial strain. Thus, a grace period of six years is
recommended for the Bank loan. In view of the magnitude of ENEE's investment
program, financing of interest during construction until December 31, 1985
(by which time the first El Cajon unit is expected to enter into commercial
operation) is, too, recommended.
Future Finances
5.18      The financial projections are based on the assumption that ENEE's
tariffs will be adjusted to achieve a 9% return on average net revalued assets
in operation (subject to the revaluation provisions specified in para. 5.05). 1/
Such return would result in tariff levels in line with marginal cost of
supply, and would enable ENEE to make a 19% contribution to its 1979-1985
investment program which is reasonable in view of the magnitude of the works
involved. Accordingly, ENEE has agreed to amend the existing covenant which
provides for an 8% return. ENEE has also agreed to maintain the provisions of
the previous Loan Agreement (1629-HO) which require it to review its revenue
forecasts and submit to the Bank, before August 31 of each year, the results
and measures to be taken to achieve the covenanted rate of return. Because of
the lumpiness of the Project, it is estimated that, even with this rate of
return, during the first years of El Cajon construction ENEE's financial
structure would deteriorate somewhat and debt service coverage would fall;
however, starting in 1986, when the Project is expected to come into operation,
this trend would reverse and ENEE's financial position would improve substan-
tially.
5.19      When El Cajon comes into operation, ENEE's rate base will increase
sharply as the value of the assets incorporated would be about 1.6 times the
value of net plant in operation at the end of the preceding year. Conse-
quently, application of the 9% rate of return requirement would then lead to
a very sharp tariff increase, which the financial projections and economic
analysis show not to be required. Accordingly, during negotiations it was
agreed that, if ENEE's financial situation is sound, for the first three years
of operation of El Cajon the rate of return covenant would not be applied and,
1/   ENEE's Board has approved that, effective March 1, 1980, electricity
rates be increased by about 12% to the level required to achieve this
rate of return.



- 37 -
instead, ENEE commits itself to maintain its average tariffs constant in real
terms, at the level required to produce an annualized rate of return of 9% in
the period preceeding the initial operation of El Cajon. 1/
5.20      As under previous loans, ENEE has agreee to retain all earnings
for investment in its facilities, and to obtain the Bank's concurrence
before borrowing if its internal cash generation is less than 1.4 times its
maximum future debt service requirement.
5.21      The major projects provisions of the Nispero Loan and Guarantee
Agreeements (1629-HO) have been repeated. These provisions: (a) require ENEE
to inform the Bank before making any capital expenditure which would increase
ENEE's gross fixed assets in operation by more than 2%, and to furnish a
report showing the economic justification and soundness of the proposed
investment; and (b) commit the Government to ensuring that expansion of power
facilities in Honduras is carried out in a coordinated manner in order to
prevent waste, duplication and unnecessary investment, on the basis of
economically justified programs and within the limits of ENEE's financial
and managerial capacity.
5.22      The financial projections show that the debt/equity ratio would
reach a maximum of 54:46 in 1983, which is considered acceptable in view of
the lumpiness of the Project. Debt service coverage is forecasted to be tight
through Project construction and would drop to a low of 1.0 in 1985 when
Project related debt amortizations start to build up. However, this situation
is forecasted to be transitory and the ratio is expected to rise to 1.3 in
1986 and to 1.6 in 1988. The short term financial position is also expected
to be somewhat tight until about 1986, and ENEE will have to make use of the
proposed line of credit (para. 5.08); the amounts envisaged (up to US$4 million)
indicate that this should not pose any major problems. Forecasts for key
financial indicators for the 1979-1988 period are shown in Table 5-12.
5.23      Undertaking a hydroelectric project of the size of El Cajon involves
a substantial financial risk for Honduras. Such projects are subject to con-
siderable uncertainties and the Government would have to mobilize any additional
funds required by ENEE to meet cost overruns. As noted in para. 4.10, consider-
able effort has been expended to ensure that the cost estimates for the Project
are accurate. If, despite these precautions, cost overruns should develop,
the most recent balance-of-payments forecasts show that additional commercial
borrowing could be sustained without unduly impairing Honduras' creditworthi-
ness and growth prospects. In the event that very large cost overruns were
to be incurred, Honduras might have to request additional support from conces-
sional sources in order to avoid debt servicing problems. Project slippage
would also have a material impact on ENEE's financial projections; it would
delay the substantial fuel economies expected from the Project and require
offsetting tariff increases to meet the rate of return covenant. Slippage
in the transmission works associated with the Project would have similar
implications, and major fluctuations in exchange rates would lead to an
increase in projected debt service requirements.
1/   This is expected to result in rates of return of 7.4% in 1987 and 8.6%
in 1988. From 1989 on, the 9% rate of return would again become
applicable.

Performance Indicators
5.24      Selected indicators showing ENEE's expected achievements in the
period 1979-1988 in the areas of increasing access to service, improving
efficiency and maintaining an acceptable financial situation, are given in
Table 5-14. They were agreed with ENEE during negotiations and will be
incorporated in regular progress reports.
6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least-Cost Solution
6.01      EBASCO's Optimization and Tariff Study has shown that the completion
of the El Cajon Project as early as 1985--the earliest feasible year--would
allow ENEE to meet, at least cost, the growing interconnected system demand
for electric energy during the 1980s. The need for additional capacity in
that decade and how it should be provided until 1985 was discussed in para-
graphs 3.05-3.07. The expected growth during 1980-1983 would be met at least
cost by the additton of 52.5 MW of the Nispero Project and during 1983-1985
by further thermal plant additions of 52.5 MW.
6.02      The EBASCO Study considered some 20 alternative generation installa-
tion sequences to find the optimum hydro-thermal generation mix. In addition
to El Cajon--at various dam heights, with and without staged construction--
these sequences included the installation of other hydroelectric projects in
line with their feasible construction schedule. The alternative based on
completion of El Cajon (with about 300 MW) in the mid-1980s was found to be
less costly than all others. At fuel prices then prevailing, the second-best
alternative consisted exclusively of installation of thermal plants in the
1978-1988 decade.
6.03      At the time of project appraisal, based on 1978 cost data, EBASCO
also compared the all-thermal expansion with an installation sequence for
El Cajon coming into operation in 1985, 1987 and 1989. For this comparison
(summarized in Table 6-1 and Figure 6-1) 1/, expansion plans were modeled
with the aim of minimizing the total costs of investment, operation (includ-
ing fuel) and maintenance 2/. In these plans the hydroelectric energy was
supplemented by oil-fired steam-electric, diesel and gas turbine units,
assuming investment costs of US$680/kW and US$599/kW for the first and second
steam electric unit, respectively; US$550/kW for diesels; and US$216/kW for
gas turbines. The cost of fuel 3/ was assumed to be US$13.55/barrel for
Bunker C and US$24.22/barrel for diesel oil. EBASCO's analysis shows that
1/   Table and Figure references in this section refer to Annex 6.
2/   EBASCO's computer programs calculated fuel costs on the basis of
optimum hydro-thermal dispatch and maintenance schedules compatible
with an acceptable loss-of-load probability of up to one day per year.
3/   Includes inland transport cost of about US$1.00/barrel.

the total present value of the costs of power produced by existing and future
plants is not very sensitive to the timing of El Cajon completion for dis-
count rates approximating the estimated opportunity cost of capital in
Honduras (about 10% in real terms):

6.04       At appraisal, based on fuel prices then prevailing and a lower project
cost estimate, the equalizing discount rate between the program which assumes
completion of El Cajon in 1985 and the all-thermal program was estimated to be
about 11.5% if fuel prices stayed constant and 14.1% if they escalated at 2%
per annum in real terms (Table 6-2). Additional likely or potential benefits
from an earlier completion of the Project were not considered in the EBASCO
study such as (a) the reduction of flood damage in the Sula Valley by storing
in the El Cajon reservoir the flood waters from the Sulaco and Humuya rivers;
(b) sale of initial surplus hydroelectric energy to neighboring countries;
(c) regulation of flow during dry seasons thus allowing improved river flow
for Sula Valley irrigation; (d) transportation and tourism on the reservoir
which would extend into presently inaccessible areas; and (e) the training
and institution building aspects of the Project. These benefits, with the
exception of (a) and (b), are not easily quantified. They would all, how-
ever, enhance the attractiveness of the alternative which calls for the
earliest possible commissioning of El Cajon, and, considering considering too
the likelihood of fuel cost increases, EBASCO recommended this course of
action to the Government. With the (a) and (b) benefits taken into account,
the equalizing discount rate between the program which assumes completion of
El Cajon in 1985 and the all thermal program would rise to about 14.3%. In
November 1979, and in order to take account of design changes, world market
conditions, revised project cost estimates, fuel prices and electricity sales
revenue data, check calculations were made to verify the judgements reached
during appraisal. These revealed that now the Project (with commissioning date
shifted to 1986) is the preferred alternative up to a rate of discount of 19%.
6.05       The basic assumptions for the appraisal's economic analysis are
stated in Table 6-6. The sensitivity of the equalizing discount rate to
changes in the major elements of uncertainty affecting the investment
choice is shown in Table 6-2 indicating that an increase in the construc-
tion cost of El Cajon by 30% would reduce the equalizing discount rate
between the proposed least-cost and the all-thermal program by 2.5 percen-
tage points. In view of the advanced state of the detailed engineering



- 40 -
of the Project the above shows a notable margin for the risk of project cost
overruns. On the other hand, the equalizing discount rate could rise 2.5
percentage points if fuel costs were to increase 2% annually in real terms.
As real fuel costs are expected to increase over the long term, the Project is
strongly justified as the most economical alternative. The above sensitivity
analysis consequently shows that the Project has been chosen on an economically
sound basis.
Return on Investment Program
6.06       The rate of return has been estimated as the discount rate which
equates the net cost and benefit streams associated with the project over its
useful life. As shown in Table 6-5, the costs include the investment and
operating costs of El Cajon and the associated transmission and distribution
investments required to deliver its output to consumers. The benefits were
assumed to consist of the revenue produced by the sales increment and the
reduction of fuel costs and other operating costs in the thermal generating
plants existing by the time El Cajon comes into operation. The revenues were
measured at the average 1986 tariffs used in the financial projections (deflated
to 1979 price levels): L 0.116/kwh.
6.07       Based on November 1979 prices, the rate of return on investment-
including estimated flood control benefits and with unskilled labor shadow
priced-was estimated to be 13.5%. It should be noted that this figure still
understates to some degree the economic rate of return because the revenues
from the sales of electricity alone do not fully measure the social benefits
of the Project to residential and public users or to the economy (by providing
transportation and tourism on the reservoir, and improving river flow for
irrigation) or the indirect benefits to the economy through the multiplier
effect on industry and commerce, whose production and opportunities to create
employment depend on readily available electricity supply, which the Project
would amply supply for the 1986-1990 period.

7. SUMMARY OF PROPOSED AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations agreements were reached with the Government and
with ENEE, as applicable, on the following principal points:
(a) A program and timetable for tariff structure revision and implementa-
tion (para.1.22).
(b) Implementation of compensation scheme changes for certain personnel
categories (para. 2.07).
(c) Exchange views on the recommendations of the Organization and
Management study by October 30, 1980. ENEE to implement the agreed
proposals by March 31, 1981 (para. 2.12).
(d) Scope of supplementary information to the audited financial state-
ments to be provided with these (para. 2.14).
(e) Engagement of insurance consultants for the project (para. 2.20).
(f) Organization of the El Cajon project unit, consulting and advisory
services required and timetable for staffing the project unit
(paras. 4.05, 4.15, 4.16).
(g) ENEE's transmission and distribution investment program will be
revised in light of the recommendations which will result from the
National Electification Master plan. The El Cajon transmission
facilities will be completed by August 31, 1985 (para. 4.05).
(h) Cement to be procured through placement of annual contracts,
through ICB (para. 4.18).
(i) Program for ecological, environmental and resettlement measures
(para. 4.24).
(j) ENEE will periodically furnish to the Bank detailed inspection
programs for the dam and other project works (para. 4.25).
(k) The Government will make equity contributions to ENEE totalling
the equivalent of US$113.2 million over the 1979-1985 period, in
accordance with a time schedule to be reviewed periodically. The
Government will also make loans to ENEE for about US$20.5 million
under terms and conditions to be agreed upon (para. 5.02).
(1) ENEE will revalue work in progess for projects which warrant it
because of their magnitude and extended construction time (para. 5.05).
(m)  Lrrangements with the Central Bank of Honduras for a revolving
line of credit. ENEE will furnish to the Bank annual cash budgets
(para. 5.08).



- 42 -
(n) ENEE will be authorized to make short-term placements of funds at
rates of interest in line with its own cost of funds (para. 5.09).
(o) The Government will implement policy measures to deal with the
macro-economic issues raised by the Project (para.5.15).
(p) ENEE will adjust its tariffs for the sale of electricity to achieve
a rate of return on revalued assests of 9% (para. 5.18). During the
first three years of operation of El Cajon the Bank may agree not to
apply the rate of return convenant provided however that tariffs are
maintained at a constant level in real terms (para. 5.19).
(q) Repetition of the covenants under previous loans to: (i) review
ENEE's revenue forecasts and submit to the Bank measures proposed to
achieve the agreed rate of return by August 31 of each year (para.
5.18); (ii) retain all ENEE's earnings for investment (para. 5.20);
and (iii) obtain the Bank's concurrence before borrowing if ENEE's
internal cash genration is less than 1.4 times the maximum future
debt service requirement (para. 5.20).
(r) Repetition of the provisions on major projects of the previous loan
(para. 5.21)
7.02      Before declaring the loan effctive, the following conditions would
have been met:
(a) Engagement of a financial administrator for the project unit (para.
2.05).
(b) Presentation of a detailed program regarding the handling of the
environmental issues, satisfactory to the Bank, and of a copy of
the report to be prepared by ENEE's consultants for IDB covering
inter alia an evaluation of the environmental program, further
actions required, and legislation needed to acquire land rights for
the reservoir (para. 4.24).
(c) All conditions of eligibility for disbursement on the IDB loans
(except for the effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan and IDA
credit) should have been fulfilled (para. 5.16).
(d) Approval of CABEI's proposed loan (para. 5.16).
(e) Approval of the Venezuelan Investment Fund first loan to the
Government (para. 5.16).
(f) Satisfactory progress shall have been made on other financing
arrangements (para. 5.16).



- 43 -
7.03      Any change in sector legislation or in ENEE's bylaws which may
adversely affect the utility's operations or its financial performance would
be an event of default.
7.04      Retroactive financing for consulting services provided by ENEE's
Consulting Board and by its Technical and Financial Advisors since November 15,
1978, in an amount not exceeding US$250,000 is recommended (para. 4.19).
7.05      With the above agreements, the Project constitutes a suitable basis
for a Bank loan of US$105 million equivalent and an IDA credit of US$20
million equivalent. The loan would be repaid over a period of 20 years,
including 6 years of grace.

EMPRESA NACIONAL DE ENERGIA ELECTRICA (ENEE)
E,L CAJON POWER PROJECT
DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT AND MAJOR WORKS
Introduction
1.        The El Cajon Power Project, with a high concrete arch dam and an
underground hydroelectric power plant, is planned to come into commercial
operation toward the end of 1985 with 2 units of 73 MW each. The remaining
2 units of its first development stage would be completed in the second half
of 1985. A second El Cajon development stage is envisaged at a later time
in ENEE's system growth. The first development stage makes certain, minimal
provisions in the underground works (power plant cavern and the hydraulic
circuit) to facilitate the iuture construction of the second stage which
would double the initial capacity of 292 MW.  Technical highlights for the
Project are given in this Attachment. The principal technical data are
tabulated on pages 7 and 8.
Geology
2.        The dam site is located about 3 km downstream of the confluence
of the Humuya and Sulaco Rivers in central Honduras (Map 4-1) in a gorge
formed in an Atima formation limestone (middle cretaceous) covered by volcanic
rock (andesites) of probably tertiary age. The limestone shows generally low
stratification, with a dip of about 30 in a downstream direction. The massive
limestone outcroppings at the site are crossed by five vertical or subvertical
fault systems (No. I and 4---approximately N/S; No. 2--NW/SE; No. 3--NE/SW;
and No. 5--W/E).
3.        The limestone is grayish, fine grained, sprinkled with fossil
fragments, flint nodules of a few centimeters and thin layers of several
meters. Karst in t4e limestone is in form of cracks or irregular shaped
cavities up to 10 m size, most of them filled with clay. The karst is of
ancient origin (probably 2 million years) and was formed before the Atima
formation was covered by the volcanic rock.
4.        At the dam site, the rock permeability is related to fractures
and karst. The groundwater drainage spills into the Humuya river partly
below the water surface and partly through continuous springs discharging along
the river banks. The hydraulic gradient towards the river is very low, below
0.05. The area of high permeability reaches to a point below the bottom of
the powerhouse cavern. To waterproof the dam abutment and cavern areas, an
extensive grouting system will be installed in addition to sealing karstic
cracks with concrete. The drainage curtain system has been extensively
studied by specialized consultants and should be satisfactory.

5.        Seismic risk has also been extensively studied, and a microseismo-
logical survey will be continued during the detail design and construction
phase. The results, according to seismic specialists, have confirmed that
the faults are inactive and reactivation is unlikely. However, the design
of the dam provides for potential surface breaks on account of the natural
seismic actions along the edges of and within the tectonic plates and seismic
action induced by the weight of the impounded reservoir. The investigations
did not indicate presence of active faults or recent fault activity which, on
the basis of observed sound calcite deposits in the lower parts of the faults,
the shape of the fault cracks, and the composition of clay deposits in the
faults, is estimated to date back some half a million years. The seismic
risk has been calculated to result in a maximum acceleration of 0.35 g
assuming that one fault could reactivate. Consequently, providing for a
safety margin, 0.4 g was adopted for the design. The chance for a reservoir
induced earthquake was estimated to be 0.16. Since no major fault exists
at less than 10 km from the site, it appears that the geological and seismic
considerations have been adequately taken into account.
Hydrology, Spillway and River Diversion
6.        The catchment area for the Project is about 8,300 km2 (Humuya
river--3,680 km ; Sulaco river--4,620 km ). The estimate of the average river
flow of 110.3 m3/s is based on 1966 to 1977 observations and the Monte Carlo
probability method, creating a theoretical flow sequence for a 50-year period.
December through May average flow is only 31.7 m /2 (29% of average flow)
ranging from 41.1 m3/s in December to 17.1 m /s in April. Maximum average
flow occurs in September (295.1 m3/s) and October (277.5 m3s); both months
account for about 52% of the total annual flow estimated at 3.481 x 10  m 3
Maximum flow is always the result of passing of hurricanes or tropical storms
and was estimated assuming such an event would occur over the catchment area.
A Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) of 14,280 m3/s has been estimated. This PMF
value is considered conservative in light of the maximum recorded flood at the
site of 4,500 m3Is during hurricane Fifi in 1974.
7.        For flood control and the PMF, 3 spillway systems will be provided
in addition to the spare reservoir volume of 1.82 x 106m3between the highest
operating level at 285 m elevation 1/ and the maximum spill level at 302 m
elevation. The main (service) spillway will consist of a 2,000 m3/s tunnel.
Three bottom outlets, to discharge 630 m3/s each, will be installed in the dam
at 170 m elevation. If the PMF should occur, the spillway at the crest of the
dam (at 295 m elevation) will operate; the combined discharge capacity is such
as to be able to pass a flood having a peak in flow to the reservoir exceeding
17,000 m3/s even with several gates out of operation.
1/ Meters above sea level.

8.        During 2-1/2 years of the period of construction of the dam, the
river will be diverted through a 500 m long shotcrete lined tunnel through
the rock of the right abutment3  It will be circular shaped, of 13 m diameter
and have a capacity of 2,300 m Is for a flood recurrence probability of 5 years
at this level which is larger than all recorded flows except that of hurricane
Fifi. For a higher flood the cofferdams are designed to be overtopped as are
the center blocks of the dam during construction.
Sedimentation
9.        While sedimantation rgnges normally from 1 x 10  to 8 x 10  t
annually, in 1974 some 50 x 10  t were reached.  Measurements durFng 1966
to 1977 indicate an average annual sedimentation rate of 9.8 x 10  t per year.
For the 50 years of minimum expected economic life of the Project, normal
flows during 40 years were assumed, high levels in 7 years, very6high in
2 years gnd3maximum probable in 1 year, accumulating to 465 x 10  t or
372 x 10  e  Sfor a specific weight of 1.25 t/m ).  With a dead volume of
1,300 x 10 m of the reservoir, sedimentation would not be a problem during
the 50-year period noted albove.
Arch Dam and Related Works
10.       The double curvature arch dam would be anchored into limestone
bedrock of a compressive strength of about 950 kg/cm. This dam design
was found to be lower in cost than feasible alternatives, including rock-
fill dams of varying height. The selected dam height is the result of
extensive economic and teclhnical optimization studies, including the optimum
relation of the cost of the dam as a function of height vs. spillway cost.
The maximum storage level would be at elevation 285 m 1/, the dam crest at
301 m, and the maximum toe to crest height 225 m. The dam would have a crest
382 m long and 7 m thick aid a base 48 m thick. The voluwe sf the excavated
rock would be 1.15 x 10  m  and of the concrete 1.48 x 10  m
11.       The dam will be built in 22 blocks, separated by contraction joints
spaced at 18 m along the reference arch cylinder. The concrete would be
cooled during construction by water circulating through coils embedded in the
concrete and precooled before placing, if needed.  The inspection galleries
will be used for cooling water circulation, joint grouting and instrumentation.
In addition to special treatment of fault zones by excavation, deep consolida-
tion grouting and drainage drilling will be undertaken and an extensive grout
curtain provided.  Each of the three bottom outlets (para. 7) will have a
diameter of 4.8 m and will be steel lined, terminating in main gates 4.8 m
high and 3.0 m wide with maintenance gates.
1/   Meters above sea level.

12.       The service spillway (para. 7) consists of circular, concrete
lined pressure tunnels, each controlled by two roller gates (installed in a
gate pit) and terminating in a flip bucket. The main dimensions are:
diameter--12 m, length--290 and 355 m; total capacity 2,000 m3/s.
13.       The diversion tunnel is described in para. 8.  The cofferdams are
of the rockfill type (slope of 1:2), with the downstream faces protected by
gabions to limit damage during overtopping (up to 5 m of water column).  The
upstream cofferdam will be 40 m high with a volume of 14,800 m3 and crest
elevation of 137 m; the downstream--15 m high with a volume of 40,000 m3
and crest elevation of 114 m.
Hydraulic Power Circuit
14.       The hydraulic circuit will have two intake structures (one of them
for El Cajon second stage), one gate chamber with access shaft, two pressure
shafts (each with a manifold to connect to two turbines), four Francis turbines
with their draft tubes, and tailrace tunnels.
15.       Each intake structure will have (at 199.5 m elevation) two intakes
of 115 m3/s capacity each (totalling 230 m3/s for 4 units, or 57.3 m3/s for
each unit), fitted with trash racks. Two concrete lined tunnels, 4.2
diameter - 110 m long, will bring the water from the intake to the service
gates in the gate chamber. Shortly before the gate chamber, the tunnel
bifurcates to connect to roller gates installed in a 99 m deep pit, which
also serves as a supplementary power house access. The gates will be operated
by a 50 t portal crane installed on a platform at 303 m elevation on which the
trash cleaner will also be located.
16.       Both pressure shafts will be of 4.2 m diameter and have a maximum
capacity of 115 m3/s, each to feed two units. The shafts will be concrete and
and steel lined with a slope of 78% to 88% and a length of 185 m and 220 m.
At their lower end, the shafts will bifurcate and connect to the main valves.
Power House
17.       The cavern for the powerhouse has been located in sound rock as
close as possible to the left abutment of the dam. The main cavern dimensions
are. length--110 m; width--30 m; height--49 m; excavation volume about
100,000 m . The cavern will be large enough to house the four units and
provide adequate work area and an installation bay, including for the extension
of the cavern in the second atage of El Cajon. While the quality of the rock
in which the cavern will be built is quite good, concrete walls will be built
to make the powerhouse as water tight as possible. The ceiling will be formed
by an arched concrete roof, instead of supporting it by rockbolts. The main
equipment data are given in paras. 25 to 28.

Access Tunnel and Service iGalleries
18.       Access to the cavern is provided by a shotcrete lined, horseshoe
shaped tunnel of 85 m 2 cross section and about 600 m length; it connects the
cavern to the high voltage switchyard and to the access road to the site and
contains a cable gallery for the high voltage cables connecting the units and
the switchyard. Two additional horseshoe shaped, concrete lined galleries of
20 m2 will provide service and emergency exists; one links the cavern with
the open air at the tailwater discharge structure and holds the ventilation
ducts, the other is a short connection to one of the inspection galleries
of the arch dam.
Tailrace Tunnels
19.       Each unit will have a concrete lined, circular shaped tailrace
tunnel of about 75 m length with a capacity of 55 m3/s, a diameter of 4.2 m
and a counterflow slope of 14%. The outlet structure will have stoplogs for
inspection purposes.
Switchyard
20.       The switchyard will be near the entrance of the access tunnel.  A
control building will house the central control room, offices, auxiliary
equipment, a small workshop, a conference room and the reception area. The
switchyard structures will be of steel to support the substation buses and
the termination of the transmission lines.
Main Electromechanical Equipment and Data
21.        In the first stage, El Cajon Project will have four vertical axis
Francis turbines. The turbines and generators will have a speed of 300 rpm
and a nominal capacity of 75 and 73 MW, respectively at a head of 156 m. Each
turbine will be controlled by a hydraulic butterfly valve of 2.6 m diameter.
The powerhouse service crane will have a capacity of 100 t. A separate intake
in the dam, at 250 m elevation, will bring cooling water from the reservoir to
the powerhouse- This water will drive two small service hydro power units (of
1,300 kW each) to provide station auxiliary power. (The main power trans-
formers connected to the generators, the switchyard equipment and the lines
are subject to detailed optimization studies and will require a much shorter
period of construction than the Project; they are not included in the Project
but will be provided under a future follow-on project).
22.       In addition to the two service hydro power units (which are in
place of emergency diesels) a third power supply will be provided by a
station service transformer connected to the high voltage switchyard.

23.       The power plant and the switchyard will normally be controlled from
the control room (para. 20). All important power plant operations will be
automated, such as the unit start-stop sequence, and the auxiliary service
change over; this will reduce the intervention of the control room operators
to emergency conditions. For maintenance, local unit control boards will be
provided which will also house the protective, measuring and control equipment.
24.       Telecommunication equipment will be provided for remote operation
and continuous supervision of the powerhouse equipment from a mimic board in
the control room. The remote operation and supervision equipment will be
suited to collect, store and retransmit important information to the ENEE
load dispatch center in Tegucigalpa.

d/  Lower fuel costs in 1978 reflect the coming on line of the
3rd and 4th units at the Rio Lindo hydro power plant.
e/ For 1973 depreciation was calculated on unrevalued assets; starting in 1974
depreciation figures assume annual asset revaluation (and consequently differ
from the figures shown in the audited financial statements).
f/  Includes power purchased from Nicaragua.
g/ Does not include foreign exchange losses, which have been appropriated against
the asset revaluation reserve.
h/ Average of revalued net fixed assets in operation at end of preceding and end of
current year.   Note that for 1973 the rate base is not representative, since,
as of end of 1972,net fixed assets had nct been revalued.
i/  Calculated in the manner prescribed by 1629-HO Loan Agreement.  Prior loan
agreements did not require annual asset revaluation. Figures through 1977 may
be slightly underestimated (see Table 5-2, footnote a).
In 1978 ENEE changed its accounting procedures, as a consequence sales revenues
only record 11 months of sales for certain large consumers; adjustment for this
change would increase sales in GWh by 19.5 and sales revenues by Lps. 1.4 million,
raising the rate of return to 7.4%.
