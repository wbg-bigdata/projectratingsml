INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA
FOR THE THIRTEENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Government of India (GOI) for the equivalent of
US$110 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a thirteenth railway
project.
1/
PART I - THE ECONOMY-`
2.        An economic report, "Economic Situation and Prospects of India"
(691a-IN dated May 1, 1975), was distributed to the Executive Directors on
May 20, 1975. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        India is exceptional among the Bank Group's member countries for
its size, diversity, and the difficulty of its economic conditions. While
India's economic policies and performance have their shortcomings, the sheer
magnitude of the task facing the Government must be recognized. Governing
a country divided into more than 20 states with a population of some 600
million and over 60 languages is an extraordinary responsibility. The
country's poverty, and inadequate domestic savings together with a net
transfer of external resources averaging in recent years only about US$1 per
head per annum, have imposed sharp limitations on the rate of growth. Account
must be taken, also, of the uncertainties imposed by the erratic availability
of water. A bad monsoon, which is inevitable from time to time, has a per-
vasive influence over the entire economy and wipes out the results of years
of efforts. Thus, the annual growth of national income has averaged a modest
4% during the past 25 years, but only about 1% during the last four years
(1971/72-1974/75), which have included two consecutive monsoon failures --
i.e., an actual decline in per capita terms.
4.        Since independence, progress has been impressive on many fronts,
but disappointing on others, and has all too often fallen short of India's
massive needs. The growth of the socioeconomic infrastructure (transport,
education, health services, etc.) has been spectacular, but has often been
achieved at high cost and has yielded results of variable quality. Many
industrial and agricultural investment schemes have been highly successful,
but others have taken excessively long to be completed and have operated
well below full capacity. In some regions of the country, growth and
structural change have been rapid and compare favorably with developments
1/   Parts I and II in this report are identical to the corresponding parts
in the President's Report on the proposed Uttar Pradesh Water Supply
and Sewerage Project.



- 2 -
in many other parts of the wcrld, but in other regions there has been
stagnation and possibly even decline.   Despite these improvements and al-
tlhough the di'stribution of income in India is relatively even by comparison
with most developing countries, there has been little impact upon the living
standards of the vast masses of the urban and rural population.   The Govern-
ment has become increasingly concerned about the plight of the lower income
strata, which - conservativel.y eicasured - consist of some 200 million people
with incomes of less than US$60 per head per year, and has initiated in
recent years a variety of programs specifically designed to alleviate
poverty.
5.        The structure of the economy has been slow to change.   Agriculture
remains the dominant sector, accounting for some 45% of national product in
the early 1970s compared with around 49% twenty years previously. The share
of output contributed by the industrial sector has increased only slowly and,
since the late 1960s, has remained approximately constant at a level of 23%.
There has, however, been a shift in the composition of industrial production,
with consumer, intermediate, and capital goods nowT contributing about one
third each, compared with an overwhelming preponderance of consumer goods
production 25 years ago.
6.        Despite the slow pace of change and despite the undeniable magnitude
of the problems confronting her, India has the potential in a number of
important fields to mount a development effort which has a reasonable chance
of success in the longer run. In agriculture, as discussed in the economic
report of May 1975, the particular opportunities of substantial promise for
improving the food situation over the next decade are:
(a) Rejuvenation of the green revolution in wheat which
has taken place in recent years in the N1orthwest
and to a lesser extent in Bihar and West: Bengal,
but which has been losing momentum since about 1970.
This is the resu:Lt of deficiencies which can be corrected
-- most importantly seed deterioration and lagging irrigation
development.
(b)  Better use of the vast potentials that have been created
by surface irrigation through more expedlitious project
completion and complementary land and on-farm improve-
ments to ensure better management and higher productivity of
water.
(c) Acceleration of groundwater development,, especially in the
Eastern regions, which are figuratively described as
"floating on water," where the untapped potential is large
and where consequently there are large opportunities for
multiple cropping, better water management and greater
crop security.
(d) Promotion of increased production of monsoon rice, based
on improved varieties which as yet have had only modest



- 3 -
success but which are expected, on the basis of current
research, to open the way to much greater productivity
over India's vast rain-fed rice producing areas during
the next few years.
(e) Pursuit of the promising, although somewhat less
definite, potential for greater productivity in dryland
cultivation and for extensive introduction of higher
yielding varieties of coarse grains.
Because of the difficulties likely to be encountered in the effective devel-
opment of these potentials, their realization is likely to follow uneven time
patterns, probably coming in bursts of expanded production as in the case
of the green revolution. And, along with administrative concentration and
effectiveness, they will all require provision of the supplies and services,
especially fertilizer and power for irrigation, which are essential complements
of the necessary technical and environmental changes.
7.        Greater agricultural success would also make an important contribu-
tion to India's perenially difficult balance of payments situation, which is
frequently aggravated by the need for large food imports. From the balance
of payments viewpoint, another essential ingredient for a resumption of
modest growth is sustained export volume growth at considerably higher rates
than have been achieved historically. In view of the composition of Indian
exports, the momentum for such growth would have to be provided primarily
by the rapid expansion of industrial exports which, in addition to easing
the foreign exchange constraint, would act as an important stimulant to
industrial growth -- notably absent since the mid-sixties. In the field
of energy, too, there is considerable potential in the development of recent-
ly discovered oil resources and in the continued expansion of coal production.
8.        It is hard, however, to conceive of the timely and effective
exploitation of these various potentials unless administrative capabilities,
which are overtaxed and diffused in an attempt to guide and control most
economic activities, are focused on these areas. The requirement for
industrial export stimulation would appear to be more generous and expeditious
incentives, sufficiently attractive and reliable to induce domestic producers
to venture into the competitive pressures of world markets. Finally,
realization of India's potential will undoubtedly also require a considerable
infusion of external assistance, both to ease the payments constraints and
to supplement the limited domestic resources available for development.
9.        While there is thus potential for resuming the interrupted process
of growth, there remains the formidable obstacle of the current difficulties
facing India. The short-term problem is much the same as it appeared last
year, with the important exception that the efforts made to adjust to changed
circumstances and the responsiveness of aid givers to India's needs should
mitigate the hardships that lie ahead. Last year began with deficient winter
rains and a poor spring harvest, with one of the worst Government wheat
procurement experiences on record, with a prospective balance of payments
deficit of US$2.5 billion or twice as much as in the preceding year, with



-4
inflation running at an annual rate of 30% and a fiscal situation seemingly
out of hand, and with serious energy and material shortages and little
prospect for alleviating them through imports witlhin the severe constraints
of the balance of payments. It was hardly surprising in this situation that
adjustment to immediate difficulties was the prime economic preoccupation.
Growth had necessarily to take a second place to short-run exigencies in
the emphasis of economic policy in this first year of the Fifth Five-Year
Plan period.
10.       Monetary expansion, which had been running at a rate of 15% in
1973/74, was reduced through tight credit restrictions. The burden of these
restrictions was borne largely by private and Government commercial activities,
without a significant reduction in the rate of increase in net bank financing
of the Government Budget. To this curtailment of credit to the commercial
sector, there was added the deflationary influence arising from the net use
of reserves and as a result the rate of monetary expansion in 1974/75 was
reduced to about 6%, or less than half that of the previous year. This, in
combination with some improvements in physical supply, relieved the upward
pressure on prices, and there was even a small price reduction in the second
half of the fiscal year. 1With continuing tight monetary policies, prospects
are for greater price stability this year than last.
11.       The food problem was probably the single most threatening element
on the economic scene last year. A poor harvest and low procurement in the
spring was only the start of agricultural adversities. Next was failure
of the mid-year monsoon in many key agricultural areas and a monsoon (kharif)
crop which fell below that of 1973 by about 5 mil:Lion tons. The result was
a severe shortage of domestic foodgrains for the public distribution system,
with availabilities only about half of an austere level of requirements. A
real food crisis was avoided, however, by imports of more than 6 million tons
of foodgrains during the year ending in March 1975; this was almost twice as
much as the imports of 1973/74. With these imports and with relative empha-
sis on food distribution in the cities rather than the countryside, where
supply conditions were presumed to be not quite so unmanageable, the threat-
ening food situation was weathered, although not without hunger and priva-
tion for a great many of t'he rural poor who were unable to afford much of
what food was available.
12.       The oil situation was managed, although at double the cost for a
reduced import level, by curbs on consumption and by substitution. Mlotor
spirits were heavily taxed to reduce consumption by about 20%; factories
and power plants were converted from fuel oil to coal wherever possible
and supplies of fuel oil were reduced by more than 15%; coal production,
after years of stagnation, was increased by about 13%, and, after a poor
start, transport managed to keep up with the additional coal in spite of
serious labor troubles on the railways. There was also some improvement in
the operationof the deficient power system through special efforts to raise
the low capacity utilization of thermal plants and by a more systematic allo-
cation of available power, with special priority for requirements of agri-
cultural irrigation and fertilizer production. Power shortage has remained,
nevertheless, a severe constraint on the economies of many regions. Among



-5-
other critical shortages, the supply situation eased in the course of the
year, especially for fertilizer, steel and non-ferrous metals. The fertilizer
situation was brought into better balance by a combination of substantial
imports and some lag in demand attributable largely to poor weather and
sharply increased prices. Steel and other metal supplies also improved
during the year, with some increase in domestic production in the case of
steel and also because of price resistance and uncertainty in a sluggish
industrial situation.
13.       Last year's balance of payments turned out to be manageable in
spite of a 45% jump in the import bill. Economies in import volume helped.
More importantly, there was also an increase of 22% in the value of exports.
The main payments support, however, was an increase of about US$1 billion
in external financing, made up of large drawings on the International Mone-
tary Fund including the Fund's Oil Facility, larger aid from the India
Consortium including the World Bank Group, oil purchases on credit, a mil-
lion tons of wheat on loan from the USSR, and additional food aid from
several other countries. With all this, in 1974/75, India had to draw on its
gross reserves (US$1,416 million as of March 31, 1974) by only about US$50
million, but external debt service requirements in the medium term were
increased, as were obligations to the IMF.
14.       This year (1975/76), the economic situation has started more favor-
ably than last year, with the expectation of a better harvest and larger
procurement from the spring (rabi) crop, with easier conditions in other
material supplies, and with much less inflation. However, the payments
situation is no less critical.
15.       The 1975/76 trade deficit is projected at about US$2,025 million.
This compares with about US$1,815 million last year, but with hardly any trade
deficit at all in 1972/73, which was before India's terms of trade worsened
sharply as prices of imported oil, grain, fertilizer and other essential
goods went up. Adding to the 1975/76 trade deficit another US$800 million
of payments on external obligations, and taking account also of probable net
invisible receipts, this year's overall balance of payments deficit seems
likely to come to about US$2,635 million, or about US$160 million more than
last year. These enormous deficits persist in any reasonable calculation of
minimum import requirements of fuel, food, fertilizer and other essentials,
for which further compression seems hardly feasible, even at the low level
at which the economy is functioning.
16.       Fortunately, nearly half of this year's prospective deficit (about
US$1,135 million) can be covered from gross disbursements of previously
committed foreign aid, including just over a billion dollars of Consortium
aid about evenly divided between bilateral and World Bank Group sources.
Eastern Europe is expected to provide perhaps US$100 million, which is down
considerably from last year in the absence of further food assistance from
the USSR. All this leaves a balance of US$1,500 million to be financed from
disbursements out of new aid commitments in the current year and to some
extent by an inevitable drawdown of foreign exchange reserves which stood at
US$1,365 million at March 31, 1975.



- 6 -
17.       To highlight the crucial variables in India's longer-term payments
outlook, the May 1975 economic report contains some projections, for the
10 years following 1975/76, illustrating India's debt management problem.
Broadly speaking, the conclusion which emerges is that a modest increase in
India's import capability -- an average of 5.2% per annum after allowing for
inflation - could be achieved, provided: (i) new aid commitments in real
tenrs (including IMF facilities and the aid provided by oil producers) remain
approximately at 1974/75 levels, (ii) India's exports attain an average
volume growth of about 8% between 1976/77 and 1985/86, and (iii) the bulk
of new aid continues to be provided on concessiona.l terms. Given the above
assumptions, the debt service ratio (expressed as a percentage of export
earnings) would rise from about 19% in 1974/75 to 23% in 1979/80 and then
decline slowly. India's external public debt outstanding and disbursed on
March 31, 1974, stood at US$10.2 billion.
18.       A considerably improved export performance, which will require
policy measures to improve incentives, is crucial to a successful development
effort. To the degree thal exports fall short of the 8% growth target,
India's creditworthiness will be reduced, and she will face greater dif-
ficulty in borrowing to meet a larger balance of payments deficit; the re-
sult would be slower growth throughout the economy.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
19.       Since 1949, the Bank Group has made 44 loans and 73 development
credits to India totaling US$1,437 million and US'i3,428 million (both net
of cancellation), respectively. Of these amounts,, US$692 million has been
repaid, and US$1,538 million was still undisburse(I as of 1975. Annex II
contains a summary statement of disbursements as of June 30, 1975, and notes
on the execution of ongoin,g projects.
20.       Since 1957, IFC has made 14 commitments in India totaling US$51.8
million, of which US$8.4 million has been repaid, US$7.6 million sold and
US$6.3 million cancelled. Of the balance of US$29.5 million, US$22.4 million
represents loans and US$7.1 million equity. A sumrmary statement of IFC
operations as of June 30, 1975, is also included in Annex II (page 2).
21.       In recent years, the emphasis of Bank Group lending has been on
agriculture. The Bank Group has been particularly active in supporting
minor irrigation and other on-farm investments through agricultural credit
operations. Major irrigation, marketing, seed development, and dairying are
other agricultural activities supported by the Bank Group. Also, the Bank
Group has been active in financing the expansion of output in the fertilizer
sector and, through its sizeable assistance to development finance institu-
tions, in a wide range of geographically scattered medium- and small-scale
industrial enterprises. IDA financing of industrial raw materials and com-
ponents for selected priority sectors has been instrumental in facilitating
better capacity utilization in industry. The Bank Group has also been active



- 7 -
in supporting infrastructure development for power, teleconununications, and
railways. Family planning, education, water supply development, and urban
investments have also received Bank Group support in recent years.
22.       The direction of assistance under the Bank/IDA program has been
consistent with India's needs and the Government's priorities. The emphasis
of the program on agriculture, industry, power, and transport remains highly
relevant. The priority of the agricultural sector has been further enhanced
by the present world commodity situation. Thus, projects designed to foster
agricultural production through the provision of essential inputs such as
credit for on-farm investments, command area development of existing irriga-
tion schemes, and seed production form an important aspect of the Bank Group's
program for the next years. Special emphasis will be given to projects bene-
fitting small farmers. Lending in support of infrastructure and industrial
investments will focus on energy-related projects. Repeater credits for
power and railways have high priority in this context, and discussions are
under way with the Government in an effort to identify and prepare projects
specifically designed to facilitate coal transport. Lending for fertilizer
projects, which has been an important feature in recent years, is expected
to continue to occupy a prominent place in the future program.
23.       The need for a substantial net transfer of external resources
in support of India's economy has been a recurrent theme of Bank economic
reports and of the discussions within the India Consortium. The need for
readily usable foreign exchange assistance is especially pressing at a time
when output and investment have to be adjusted to a radically different
price situation. Consequently, Bank Group lending for critical industrial
raw materials and components continues to be an essential element within the
overall program of assistance. As in the past, Bank' Group assistance for
projects in India should include, as appropriate, the financing of local
expenditures. India imports relatively few capital goods because of the
capacity of the domestic capital goods industry. The import component of
projects tends to be especially low in such high-priority areas as agricul-
ture, education, and family planning. For the Bank Group to be able to make
an appropriate contribution to the financing of projects in these sectors,
it is important to cover a proportion of local expenditures.
24.       Of the external assistance received by India, the proportion con-
tributed by the Bank Group has grown significantly. In 1969/70, the Bank
Group accounted for 34% of total commitments, 13% of gross disbursements,
and 12% of net disbursements as compared with an estimated 35%, 28% and 42%,
respectively, in 1973/74, and the contribution of the Bank Group is expected
to continue growing. Whereas on March 31, 1974, the Bank Group's share of
India's outstanding external public debt was 23%; by 1979, it is likely to
account for about 25%. Because Bank Group assistance to India is predomi-
nantly in the form of IDA credits, debt service to the Bank Group will rise
slowly. In 1974/75, about 14% of India's total debt service payments were
to the Bank Group.



-8-
PART IlI - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
25.       Over much of India, especially in the rural areas, the bullock
cart remains the principal form of transport. The balance of India's
transportation needs is met; almost entirely by rail and road transport with
a relatively small amount of traffic being carried by shipping, coastal
and inland waterways, airlines and pipelines.
26.       A marked shift has gradually been taking place in the shares of
traffic between rail and road. In the early 1950s, the railways accounted
for 90% of the freight and 75% of the passengers carried by motorized
transport while by the early 1970s Indian Railways's (IR) share was about
63% and 50% respectively, with a corresponding increase in the share of
road transport. This shift: is partly accounted for by the economic advantages
of road transport over rail for certain types of traffic. The exploitation
of this advantage has been facilitated by the improvement and expansion of
the road network together with increasing availability of commercial
vehicles.
27.       The economic advantage of road over rail for shorter hauls,
particularly with high value traffic, has led IR to specialize more in long
haul and bulk traffic.  However, the growth in transportation of bulk
commodities has been adversely affected by slow growth in the economy and
in particular by the shortf-all in domestic output of the important bulk
commodities, such as steel, coal and iron ore. At: the same time, IR's
capability has been affected by industrial disputes culminating in the
nationwide 20-day strike in May 1974 and serious power shortages.
28.       The outlook for the immediate future is somewhat better.   In-
dustrial strikes have virtually ceased since May 1974, and industrial rela-
tions and union discipline appear to have improved. In addition, power
availability has increased and so IR's ability to carry more freight has
increased just as the high price of petroleum is reinforcing the economic
advantage of rail for many categories of freight. At the same time, rising
domestic production of bulk commodities, in particular steel and coal, led
to an increase of 3.8% in rail freight movement in 1974 despite the May 1974
strike. Especially noteworthy is the speedy manner in which IR restored
operations in Eastern India after the strike and succeeded in moving 12% more
coal in 1974/75 than in the previous year. Further freight traffic growth
of an average of 3.4% per annum is projected for the next four years.
29.       The rise in petroleum prices has begun to force some readjustments
in priorities for the transport sector. Even so, the coordination of
pricing and investment policies remains of concern as this has been an
area of weakness in the Government's management of this sector. The dif-
ficulties of achieving adequate coordination have been highlighted during
the preparation of earlier projects. In part, the difficulties in coordina-
tion stem from the division of responsibility for the sector between the
Central and State Governments for various modes. For instance, railways
are a Central responsibility while most roads and inland waterways are a



-9-
State responsibility. At the same time, there are also divisions of
responsibility at the Center as three ministries exercise authority over
different modes.
Transport Policy Coordination
30.       GOI carried out a transport sector review in 1973/74 in accordance
with a program agreed during negotiation of the Eleventh Railway Project.
A Bank Group mission visited India in April 1974 to discuss the results of
this review. As a result, proposals were made to improve project preparation
by strengthening planning cells in each of the transport ministries;
proposals were also made to improve project implementation, but so far
progress has been slow except in the case of IR. Since 1973, IR has been
working on the development of a 15-year corporate plan which will be revised
on a continuing basis and which will provide a long-term perspective on which
the five-year plans will be based. The initial version of the plan was
completed in January 1974. Planning cells have been established in each
of the nine zonal regions of IR to enable the initial plan to be updated and
revised as appropriate. GOI is still reviewing the proposal to centralize
in one Government agency the various functions relating to overall transport
sector management and planning. This would support the Cabinet subcommittee
on transport which is concerned with recommending general policy to the
Cabinet. GOI is also examining the suggestion that capital expenditures
of IR should fall within the purview of the Public Investment Board. This
Board is responsible to the Minister of Finance for ensuring that capital
expenditure provisions appearing in the Central Budget are consistent with
the Government's priorities. GOI has also initiated some changes affecting
overall economic planning by establishing in the Planning Commission two
new units, one for project appraisal and one for project monitoring. While
these units serve the economy as a whole, their establishment and terns of
reference mean that there is now machinery for the evaluation of IR invest-
ments within the context of the transport sector and the even broader
context of the economy. These various changes have complemented the
Government's efforts to move away from predominantly railway-oriented trans-
port planning towards examining the use of other modes to solve capacity
problems. An example of this is a proposal for a project, which is being
prepared for possible IDA financing, to move coal from Bihar/Bengal to South
India through the use of coastal shipping.
Bank Group Lending to Transport Sector
31.       The first Bank loan to India (Loan 17-IN of 1949) was for IR
and since then the transport sector has received direct assistance totaling
just over US$1,000 million. Substantial indirect support has also been
provided, through Industrial Imports Credits under which imports of com-
ponents and materials fo. the manufacture of commercial vehicles have been
financed. From the late 1950s to the mid-1960s, Bank Group lending included
finance for three of India's major ports (Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta)
and for a highway project serving Eastern India. Oil tankers for coastal
and international service have also been financed. There was also, in the
1960s, an aviation project for purchase of aircraft for Air India. Lending



- 10 --
to IR, wh'ich has so far amoun!: d to USS786.5 million, has dominated Bank
Group assistance to the sector.
PART lTV - 'I_E PROJECT
32.       The project was appraised in March/April 1975 and the Appraisal
Report (No. 787a-IN, dated July 28, 1975) is being circulated separately to
the Executive Directors.  Negotiations were held in Washington from July 7,
1975, to July 18, 1975. The borrower was represented by Mir. M. N. Bery,
Chairman of the Indian Railways; H-lr. K. S. Ehandari, Financial Commissioner,
Indian Railways; iMr. M. Menieizes, Director, Plannin, of the Indian Railways;
llr. S. V. Sastry, Joint Director, Finiance, Indian Railways; and Mr. V. N.
Rajagopalan, Director, Department of Economic Affairs, Government of India.
A credit and project summary is attached as Anrnex III.
Past Experiences With IR
33.       The Bank Group has long been closely associated with the Indian
Railways. The first Bank loan to India in 1949 was; one of US$34 million
equivalent for IR. The proposed credit would bring the total amount of
loans and credits for IR to US$896.5 million equivalent. Previous lending
operations have been satisfactorily completed and the disbursements under
the Twelfth Railway credit are virtually complete. These have assisted
the IR to triple the volume of freight carried and to more than double its
passenger traffic between 1951 and 1974.   IR has been able to maintain an
operating ratio of around 80% over most of this period, although there has
been some deterioration in the earnings position during the last two years
because of stagnant traffic and a sluggish economy. Even during the recent
difficult period, IR's financial performance compared favorably with most
other railway systems.   IR's tarif's are steadily moving toward a cost
based structulre (para. 46); IR has, at the request of the Bank Group,
prepared an action program and targets to improve wagon turnaround (para.
42); and IR is preparing a 15-year Corporate Plan (para. 40) to improve
its perspective planning in which the Bank Group has financed services of
a consultant.
IR's Investment Program
34.       The draft Fifth Flive-Year Plan (1974/75-'1978/79) envisaged an
investment program of Rs. 23.5 billion based on an estimated 32% increase
in freight traffic (from 21.5 million tons in 1974/75 to 280 million tons
by 197O/79) and a nearly 20% increase in passenger traffic (from 2.6 bil-
lion to 3.0 billion passengers). Due to price increases, to realize these
physical targets, a substantial increase in outlay would have been required.
fIowever, these targets were subsequently found to be overly ambitious because
of reduced demand for freight traffic resulting from adverse economic devel-
opments - escalation of prices of fuel and other essential commodities, a
stagnant economy and strained industrial relations. Consequently, while
price increases have made it necessary to maintain the originally planned
investment level of Rs 23.5 billion, this will now support a more realistic



- 11 -
freight traffic capacity of 250 million tons in 1978/79. The outlay required
to handle this revised target also would have been much higher were it not
for expected improvements in operating efficiency (see para. 42).
The Project
35.       The project consists of new and ongoing works to improve efficiency
and reduce costs, including modernization of equipment over the project period
1975/76 and 1976/77 and to meet the projected increase in demand for freight
and passenger services. The main elements of the project are the construction
and putting into service of about 350 locomotives, about 300 electric multiple
units (electric trains for passengers), about 1,500 coaches and about 20,000
wagons (four-wheeler equivalent). The project also includes electrification,
track works, bridge works and modernization of workshops and sheds, and nec-
essary spare parts for maintenance of locomotives and rolling stock. The
total cost is US$1,010 million with a foreign exchange content of US$154.2
million. The proposed credit would finance US$110 million of this amount in
addition to US$20 million financed under the current Railway XII Credit. Thus,
during the two-year project period, IDA would finance nearly 13% of the total
cost or 84% of the foreign exchange content of the project. The balance of
the foreign exchange costs will be met either from GOI's own resources or
bilateral sources. The local project expenditure will be financed in roughly
equal proportions by IR's internally generated funds and Central Government
funds. The proposed credit would be channeled through GOI to IR. New in-
vestments from the proceeds of the credit will appear in IR's accounts as
financed from capital-at-charge and will represent Government's equity in-
vestment.   The process of the credit which are used to finance replacements
will be reimbursed by IR to GOI in local currency as expenditures are in-
curred.
36.       The principal items to be financed out of the proposed credit
are imported components and materials for manufacture of locomotives and
rolling stock (US$66.8 million); the construction of track works, bridges
and electrical works (US$12.0 million); electrification (US$4.2 million);
modernization of workshops and other works (US$11.4 million). In addition,
US$15.6 million would be used for the financing of necessary maintenance
spare parts.
Size of Indian Railways
37.       IR operates a system of about 60,000 route-Km, consisting of about
30,000 Km of broad gauge (BG), about 26,000 Km of metre gauge (MG), and a
small route length of narrow gauge (NG). IR owns three modern factories
which manufacture all its diesel and electric locomotives, most of its
passenger vehicles, and a small proportion of its wagons (wagons are
largely manufactured by private builders). IR has 41 workshops in addi-
tion to many running sheds for inspection, refueling and other services.
38.       IR is the second largest railway system in the world under single
management, next to the Soviet railway system.    It is difficult to compare
the IR with other railway systems in the world because of the diversity



- 12 -
of the circumstances under which they operate and the needs they
fulfill. However, the size of IR's BG network (about 30,000 route-Km),
which carries about 80% of IR's traffic, is comparable to the French
National Railways (about 35,000 Km) and German Federal Railway (about
29,000 Km). IR is also India's largest employer wi.th a staff of about
1.7 million.
Management of Indian Railways
39.       The Indian Railways system is owned by the Central Government.
Its operations are managed by a Board of five members headed by a chair-
man who is an ex-officio Principal Secretary to the GOI reporting to the
Minister of Railways.    One Board member, the Financial Commissioner,
has discretionary power to report directly to the Minister of Finance on
financial matters.  The Railway Board operates the system through nine
Zonal Railways, each of which has a General Manager. The Railway Planning
Directorate handles all aspects of railway planning and is directly
under the Board.  In addition, an Economic Unit, which reports to the
Board, was established in 1965 in consultation with the Bank. This Unit,
originally created to undertake special economic studies of major railway
investments, is now expected to increasingly assist the Planning Directorate
in preparing a Corporate Plan and in the studies of investment programs
of the zonal railways. The railway budget is separate from the general
budget, and control over railway finance and policy is exercised by Parlia-
ment through discussions and voting on the railway budget and also through
the recommendations made by the Railway Convention Committee and other
parliamentary committees.
IR's Investment Planning
40.       Railway planning in India consists of the drawing up of Five-
Year Plans in harmony with the National Five-Year Plans and the preparation
of annual investment and work programs within the framework of Five-Year
Plans. Projects costing more than Rs 0.5 million are sanctioned by the
Railway Board and included in the annual program only after completion
of detailed project studies. The evaluation processes and methods are
sound. In the past, the evaluation criteria in most cases tended to be
technical and financial while economic considerations were taken into
account only in the more significant new works such as gauge conversion
and electrification schemes and new lines. However, increased emphasis is
now being given to development of project evaluation techniques, improving
the data base and evaluation of alternatives. This is expected to
furthe' improve with the involvement of the Economic Unit of the Railway
Board at early stages of project preparation works. In addition, in order
to set long-term objectives so that a clear framework exists as a basis
for five-year and annual planning, a 15-year Corporate Plan for IR is
being prepared. An initial version of IR's Corporate Plan was completed
in January 1974, with the help of a consultant provided by the Bank, and
work is now proceeding on a revised version of the Plan which should be
ready by June 1976.

Operating Efficiency
41.       IR's operating performance has compared favorably with other
railways of similar size. For instance, on recent data, gross freight
trailing loads averaged 1,400 tons for IR compared with nearly 900 tons each
for the French and German railways; net ton-Km per year per ton of wagon
capacity, at 14,000 ton-Km for IR, were about double those attained by
the German Federal Railway or the French National Railways; wagon turn-
around at 15 days in 1973/74 for IR, on the other hand, compares with 8 and
12 days for the German and French railways respectively. These comparisons
are of course only indicative because operating conditions for each of the
systems vary; furthermore, IR's turnaround time witnessed a deterioration
in 1974 on account of the difficult operating conditions. Nonetheless,
even as indicators, these data show that IR operates at a satisfactory
level of efficiency.
42.       Improvement in operating efficiency has been receiving increasing
attention in recent years. An action program with targets for improved
wagon turnaround has been prepared and its effect on IR's total investment
requirements was taken into account in determining the need for additional
capacity.
Financial Performance
43.       Government of India requires Indian Railways to pursue a financial
policy which will result in the earning of net revenues which are sufficient
to meet the dividend payment due to the Government on capital provided to
the Railway, and to earn a small surplus out of which minor capital invest-
ments can be financed. The two previous IDA credit agreements required
that IR earn sufficient revenue to meet all operating expenses and the
dividend payable to the Government. Until 1973, IR was able to meet these
requirements. However, in 1973 and subsequently, the sharp rise in fuel
and wage costs, labor unrest and lagging traffic volume due to slow
economic growth, have led to an overall deficit (after meeting dividend
payments) of Rs 1.15-billion (US$146.5 million) in 1973/74 and an estimated
deficit of Rs 1.28 billion (US$163.1 million) in 1974/75. The deterioration
in financial performance has been reflected in the operating ratio (per-
centage of operating expenses to operating revenues) which increased from
84.5 in 1972/73 to 93.7 and 94.4 in 1973/74 and 1974/75 respectively, while
the return on capital at-charge dropped from an average of 4.6% over the
years leading up to 1972/73 to an estimated 1.5% in 1973/74 and 1974/75.
44.       Due to the deterioration in financial performance as described
above, at the time the Twelfth Railway Project (Credit 448-IN) was
negotiated, an agreement was reached to modify the financial covenant
required under previous railway credits. Accordingly, IR undertook to meet
from revenues all operating expenses and 70% of the dividend payable to
Government in 1974/75, and approximately 85% in 1975/76 and 100% thereafter.
IR suffered a further setback in 1974/75 due to the nationwide rail strike



in May 1974 and increases in costs, particularly wages. Despite these dif-
ficulties not foreseen during the negotiations of the Credit 448-IN, the
latest estimates indicate that IR has in fact substantially met the
requiremerTE (just over 69% as against 70%).  As explained below in para. 46,
IR introduced tariff increases _md cost savi-ng measures in 1974.   In the
absence of uiiforeseeu adverse circumstances, these measures should enable
IR to meet the agreed 85%. of Lh-e dividend payment in 1975/76 and 100%'
thereafter.  (Section 4.02(a) of the Development Credit Agreeenrt.)
45.       The depreciation covenant under the Twelfth Credit required appro-
priations to the Depreciation Reserve Fund (DRF) in 1974/75 and 1975/76
of Rs 1,200 million and Rs 1,250 million respectively. The DRF functions as
a reserve for renewals of capital assets. Appropriations are made annually
to DRF. The amounts are determined every five years (subject to annual
review) on the basis of an estimate of replacement costs during the following
five years. The total appropriation during the Five-Year Plan period
(1974/75 to 1978/79) is to be not less than Rs 6,500 million. The Parliament-
ary Convention Committee is now re-examining the whole structure and basis
of contributions to this fund and, therefore, has recommended that the
"interim" contribution to DRF for 1974/75 and 1975/76 should be of the order
of Rs 1,150 million each year. Consequently, the IR budgets have appropriztcd
Rs 1,150 million for each of these two years. Therefore, at the request of
GOI and IR, it has been agreed to modify the requirements of DRF agreed
under Credit 448-IN, with a requirement under this proposed credit that the
appropriation to the DRF should not be less than Its 6,500 million in aggre-
gate for the fiscal years 1974/75 to 1978/79 and not less than Rs 1,300 mil-
lion for any of the fiscal years 1976/77 through 1978/79. (Section 4.02(b)
of the Development Credit Agreement.)
Adjustment to Increase in Petroleum Prices and Other Costs
46.       The impact of the rise in oil prices on IR's costs has been partly
offset by GOI's decision to reduce taxes on diesel fuel; this reduction
applies not only to IR but to all users of diesel fuel. Even so, IR's fuel
bill increased by 20% between 1972/73 and 1974/75. IR's adjustment to
increases in petroleum prices and other costs, especially wages, has been
prompt. In the budget for 1974/75 (March 1974) and in the supplementary
budget (September 1974), tariffs were increased overall by about 35%.. The
opportunity was taken to raise tariffs selectively on a cost-related basis
for certain bulk commodities, most notably coal. A similar cost-based
tariff policy has also been followed for passenger fares, but short distance
commuter travel still results in considerable losses for IR. Although
these tariff changes were necessary and to some extent overdue, nonetheless
their introduction on this scale was courageous. In the case of passenger
fare increases, IR faces the difficulty of providing a service for an
economy with a very low per capita income. As the tariff changes were only
in effect for part of 1974/75, the full impact will not be felt until 1975/76.

Economic Evaluation
47.       The objective of IR's fifth five-year investment program (1974/75-
1978/79) is to provide capacity for increased traffic, to improve efficiency
and to reduce costs. The program has been directed towards the transporta-
tion of bulk materials such as coal, iron ore, steel, cement, fertilizer
and petroleum products, which account for 80% of railway freight.
48.       The project includes 209 major sub-projects, each exceeding Rs 5.0
million in cost. These represent about .50% of IR's total investment; most
of the balance will be allocated for rolling stock. A sample of 29 major
sub-projects was examined by the Association in detail, while the main
features of the others were reviewed. IR's project evaluation procedures
were found to be sound. In particular, cost estimates were realistic and
the return on investments varied between 10% and 25%. The overall economic
rate of return on IR's five-year investment program is estimated at about
20%; the program responds to the priority needs of India's economy.
Procurement and Disbursement
49.       IDA-financed items will be procured through international com-
petitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's guidelines, except for
certain standard components and equipment required in the manufacture of
locomotives and for replacements during maintenance. The amount allocated
for the imports of such items is limited to US$20 million, which comes to
18.2% of the credit as compared to 23% and 20% in the Eleventh and Twelfth
railway projects respectively. A further exception to international bidding
would apply, as in previous projects, to contracts of US$50,000 or less,
which are too small to warrant the administrative complications and cost
of ICB procedures. The total value of such contracts will be less than
US$4 million. In Credit Agreement 448-IN, the Association waived the require-
ment of prior approval by IDA for awards of contracts over US$1 mill-ion for
the procurement of steel, wheels, tires, axles, wheelsets and nonferrous
metals on account of the difficult market conditions which prevailed during
the Twelfth Credit period. Since market conditions have improved, there is
no need to continue this exemption, although it has been agreed that if the
validity periods of bids for steel are less than 21 days, the Borrower
may proceed to evaluation and award, after advising the Association. Non-
ferrous metals will be procured in the international market in accordance
with procedures similar to those agreed with India under the Tenth Indus-
trial Imports Program Credit. Under this procedure, Minerals and Metals
Trading Corporation Limited (MDITC) will invite bids from not less than
tlhree suppliers from among the member countries of the Bank and Switzerland.
(Schedule 3 of the Development Credit Agreement.)
50.       The proposed credit would be disbursed against the foreign exchange
cost of imported equipment, components and materials. The credit is expected
to be fully disbursed by March 31, 1977.

C.  PROJECTS lN EXECUTIONI/
Generally, the implementation of projects has been proceeding
reasonably well. Details on the execution of individual projects are below.
The level of disbursements was $V80.3 million in FY75 or  57% of Bank Group
commitments to India in that year. The undisbursed pipeline of $1 ,535 million
as of June 30, 1975, corresponds roughly to comrmitments over the preceding
two-year pericd and reflects the lead time which would be expected given the
mix of fast and slow-disbursing pro'ects in the India program.
Ln. No.  789 Ninth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$6fi0.0 million loan of October 21, 1971; Closing
Date: December 31, 1976
Lan. No.  902  Tenth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$70.0 million loan of Jtme 8, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978
Ln. No. 1097 Eleventh Industrial Credit and Investment CorPoration of India
Project; US$100 million loan of April 2, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
These loans have supported industrialization in India through a
well-established development; finance company. LoarL 789-IN is fully committed;
disbursements under Loan 902-IN are ahead of schedule. Loan 1097 was declared
effective on July 1, 1975.
Ln. No. 614   Tarai Seeds; US$13.0 million loan of                             :
December 31, 1L976
This loan to the Tarai Development Corporation is to assist in the
development of seeds of high-yielding varieties.  The Corporation is working
efficiently and has develop(ed a reputation for excellent seed quality. Seed
production is meeting targets. Expansion of an existing processing plant has
been completed.  Two other olants are being considerably expanded.  Bids have
recently been cleared for orders to be placed for the equipment necessary to
complete the expansion program. Bids have also been cleared for special drilling
rigs to complete the land development component of the project.
Cr. No. 176 Kadana Irrigation; US$35.0 million credit of February 9, 1970;
Closing Date: September 30, 1976
This project will finance in part the construction of Kadana Dam on
the Mahi River and the expansion of the irrigated area below the dam. The
project also includes field channel construction, :Land-leveling, drainage works

and roads, and a program to support agricultural development. The project
will be completed about two years behind schedule because of delays in dam
construction. The agricultural components of the project are also behind
schedule. Some of the delays in implementation have occured at the start
of the project before major investments have been made. These will not affect
the economic justification of the project. Further delays have occurred as a
result of building materials shortages. The Government has recently intervened
and made adequate quantities of building materials available.   In spite of an
additional delay in the procurement of a large batching plant, the dam is still
expected to be completed in July 1977 which is in accordance with the revised
schedule.
Cr. No. 268 Pochampad Irrigation; US$39.0 million credit of August 23, 1971;
Closing Date: March 31, 1977
The project will assist the comprehensive agricultural development
on the right bank of the Godavari River by providing perennial irrigation to
some 100,000 ha. It includes the construction of Pochampad Dam, a concrete-
lined main canal, distributary canals, field channels, drains and roads.
Until mid-1973, overall performance on the project was satisfactory with con-
struction and disbursements from the IDA credit progressing ahead of schedule.
Acute shortages of construction materials, especially explosives for the canal
excavation, have hampered progress. As a result, construction of the main
canals has fallen about one year behind schedule. This is likely to delay the
introduction of irrigation to over 40% of the project area. Land development
is presently haphazard and increasingly lagging behind water availability in
the project. Government is aware of the inadequacy of the credit operation
for land development and has requested IDA financing for a Command Area
Development Project, t be implemented by a Central Authority for all farmers
in need of land development. Construction of the dam, which was also affected
by temporary shortages of building materials, is now progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No.  532  Godavari Barrage Project; US$45 million credit of March 7, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
This credit became effective on June 9, 1975. Tendering for both
civil works and supply of equipment is well under way. Bids for civil works
were opened on July 2 and are being evaluated.
Cr. No.  203  Pun.jab Agricultural Credit Project; US$27.5 million credit of
June 24, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Cr. No.  226  Andhra Pradesh Agricultural Credit Project; US$24.4 million

Cr. No. 540 Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC) Project; US$75.0 million
credit of April 28, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Apart from the Punjab project, which consists of mechanization
equipment only, all the above agricultural credit projects are similar in
structure, being designed to provide long- and mediuim-term credit to farmers
through credit institutions for such on-farm investments as imported tractors,
minor irrigation and land-leveling. Disbursement o:F these credits started
slowly.  So far as the minor irrigation components were concerned, the main
difficulties stemmed from the institutional requirements, in particular the
introduction of changes in lending criteria and lending terms and the strength-
ening of institutions responsible for assessing groundwater availability. These
constraints have been overcome and disbursements are on schedule.   Tractor
procurement was delayed following changes in both the supply and demand situa-
tions after the projects were originally appraised, which prompted GOI to
request that indigenous as well as imported models should be eligible for IDA
financing under these credits. The Executive Directors approved this request
in December 1973 and those credits which have tractor components have been
amended accordingly. Tractor procurement is now in progress. Some funds
earmarked for land leveling and tractors have been reallocated to minor
irrigation components. Credit 540 is a continuation nationwide of the previous
program of agricultural credit projects, which were confined to individual
States. ARC will continue to act as the financial intermediary for refinancing
agricultural credit.  Conditions of effectiveness for this Credit will have
to be fulfilled by August 28, 1975.
Cr. No.  267 Wheat Storage; US$5.0 million credit of August 23    1971; Closing
Date: September 30, 1978
This project originally consisted of construction of ten 10,000 ton
capacity godowns and ten 20,000 silo units, engineering and consulting services
and an All-India Grain Storage Study. However, a July 1974 feasibility study for
silos indicated that due to substantial cost increases, particularly in steel,
cement and other materials, the cost of constructing silos, which represented the
bulk of total project costs, would be about double the original estimates. Also,
because the increase in demand for foodgrains in Irndia has exceeded the increase
in foodgrains supply, the use of silos for buffer stock storage has shifted to
their use as bulk grain receiving, seasonal storage and dispatch facilities. The
Food Corporation of India (FCI), SIDA and IDA have thus agreed on a redesign of
the silo component that would provide about half the original 200,000 tons of

silo storage in 5 units and, in addition, 2 to 4 bulk grain receiving stations
and would also avoid an overrun in project cost. The economic rate of return
of this revised component is about 15%, slightly more than half the return
estimated at the time of original appraisal.   In order to allow suffici-ent
time to complete construction and disbursements of the silo program, the
project closing date has been extended by three years. The FCI has completed
a contract for construction of the silo foundations at 2 sites.   A tender has
been offered for foundations at 3 sites.   Tenders have been cleared for a part
of the equipment.  The godown component has been fully disbursed.   In addition,
the All-India Grain Storage Study is progressing and the staff training program
has been planned in detail and is to be implemented soon. Project implementa-
tion is now progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 456 Himachal Pradesh Ap2le Processing and Marketing; US$13 million
credit of January 22, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
This project was designed to promote the development of apple
processing and marketing in Himachal Pradesh and comprises roads, cold storage,
juice processing, and marketing facilities. The project entity, the H.P.
Horticultural Produce Processing and Marketing Corporation (HPMC) has been
established and key senior staff recruited, including the Managing Director.
Feasiblity studies have begun for cold storage and the juice concentrate plant.
Project training is expected to begin soon. A project review mission returnea
in June and its report is being prepared.
Cr. No. 241 Telecommunications IV;_US$78.0 million credit of May 3, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 1975
Cr. No. 403 Telecommunications V; US$80.0 million credit of June 25, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Disbursements have been delayed mainly because of delays in material
supply from both local and external sources. Delays in local supply were due to
labor problems affecting one of the principal suppliers and imports were delayed
due to longer than anticipated lead time required. Revised disbursement schedules
for these two credits are now expected to be met.
Cr. No.  242  Power Transmission II; US$75.0 million credit of May 3, 1971;
Closing Date: March 31.1977
Cr. No._7     Power Transmission III Project; US$85.0 million credit of May 9,
1973; Closing Date: September 30, 1977
Power Transmission II, which is a continuation of the project financed
by Loan 416-IN, was designed to assist in financing the purchase of equipment
and materials required to develop a power transmission program in nine states
under the Fourth Five-Year Plan. Initial delays occurred because of problems
associated with preparing bid documents suitable for international bidding and
the analysis of the very large number of bids involved, but all contract awards
have now been made. As a consequence of the delays, however, the closing date
of the credit had to be postponed accordingly. For Power Transmission III,
specificatimn and tendering procedures are progressing. Tenders received so
far indicate substantial cost overruns. Disbursements for Power Transmission
III have started.

In. No. 1079  IFFCO Fertilizer Project; US$109 million loan of January 24,
1975; Closing Date: March 31, 1979
The Cochin Fertilizer Project is intended to help finance the expansion
of fertilizer manufacturing facilities at Cochin.  The project is now proceeding
about 24 months behind schedule mainly because of procurement delays, slow progress
on civil works, and shortages of steel and cement. Procurement problems have been
largely overcome, and most of the equipment is either at the site or at the Cochin
port.  Another factor which has contributed to the delay has been 'tecimical pro-
blems in the commissioning of the Cochin I plant, which has required a dispropor-
tionate amount of management attention. Credit No. 481 contains funds for a Plant
Operations improvement Program which will be used in part to overcome these pro-
blems; the use of these funds has been identified on a plant-by-plant basis and
procurement has been initiated. The engineering desing for the Gorakhpur project
is well advanced and virtually all the equipment has been ordered. Although
delivery of some equipment is taking longer than forecast during appraisal, the
project is progressing without serious difficulties. Engineering work, procure-
ment and site construction for the Nangal Fertilizer Project are proceeding
satisfactorily. Progress on the Trombay IV project has been good although project
completion may be delayed by about four months becauLse of longer than expected
delivery times for critical equipment. The Sindri Credit became effective on
February 27, 1975. Engineering design and procureme!nt are proceeding on schedule.
The IFFCO loan became effective on April 28, 1975.
Cr. No.  448  Railways XII; US$80 million credit of December 21, 1974; Closing

This project consists of new and ongoing works in the Indian Railways
investment program. Disbursements are on schedule.
Cr. NIo.  294 Bihar Agricultural Markets; US$14.0 million credit of March 29,

Cr. No. 378 Karnataka Wholesale Agricultural Markets Project; US$8.0 million
credit of May 9, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
These projects were designed to help with extablishment of wholesale
markets in a number of towns in Bihar and Karnataka. Progress under the projects
has generally been satisfactory. Markets construction in Bihar was delayed due
to legal challenges arising out of the state's acquisition of land for market
sites; however, these difficulties have been satisfactorily resolved. Market
construction in Karnataka is expected  to be on schedule.

Cr. No. 312  Population; US$21.2 million credit of June 14, 1972; Closing
Date: June 30, 1978
This credit was designed to finance an experimental and research
oriented population project in Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh.  The project's
infrastructure, which would provide the optimum facilities (buildings,
equipment, staff and transport) according to GOI standards in selected
districts in each state, is almost complete. The two Population Centers,
which will design and monitor research aimed at improving the family planning
program, are now functioning. The building program will be largely completed
as scheduled in March 1976.
Cr. No. 342 Agricultural Universities; US$12.0 million credit of November 10,
1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Project implementation has improved with satisfactory progress on
civil works, preparation of equipment lists, bid documents, fellowship programs
and university development plans. The rate of disbursement has been slow,
partly due to previous delays in the selection of key personnel and in the
preparation of equipment lists, but is expected to improve by FY1976 in line
with progressing construction and equipment procurement.
Cr. No. 356 Industrial Development Bank of India; US$25.0 million credit of
February 9, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
This project had a particularly slow start which was mainly due to
institutional problems in the participating State Financial Corporations. The
last review mission reported in May 1974 that satisfactory progress could be
expected soon. Another review mission has just returned from the field and is
preparing its report.

Cr. No. 390  Bombay Water Spply and Sewerage Project; US$55.0 million credit
of January 22, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 197b
A substantial cost overrun on the project from US$158 million
equivalent to about US$375 million equivalent has been caused by inflation
and price increases resulting from delays in appointment of engineering
consultants and redesign of certain components of the project. Action is
being taken to rephase the project construction to fit the financing available
from the credit, local loans and bonds, and internal cash generation of the
project entity. The revised project description and estimated costs have been
agreed between the authorities concerned, but a financing plan has not yet
been finalized. Meanwhile, project construction is proceeding and most major
contracts for civil works, equipment and materials have been awarded. Dis-
bursements should therefore be faster than in preceding years. Financial
performance of the project entity during 1974/75 was satisfactory, but major
rate increases will be necessary starting in 1976, if the recommended financing
plan is adopted.
Cr. No. 528 Tenth Industrial Imports Program; US$200.0 million credit of
February 14, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
This credit was signed on February 14, 1975, for the initial tranche
of US$100 million and amended to US$200 million on March,7, 1975. The credit
became effective on March 31, 1975. By mid-July, disbursements had reached
US$56.7 million.

Cr. No. 427  Calcutta Urban Development Project; US$35.0 million credit of
September 12, 1913; Closig Date: December 31, 1977
Progress in implementation of this project w,1as rather slow during the
first construction season (19'73/74) in view of the reduction in overall fund-ing
of the CMDA program and of organizational problems, but project implementation
and credit disbursements have now improved.   However, project costs have
increased considerably, especially for subprojects in the water supply and
sewerage/drainage sectors.  A recent supervision mission examined the status
of the project, with a view to suggesting reduction or omission of certain
subprojects, in order to accomodate the project size to funding avai'lable.
CIMDA is now preparing a request for a redefined project description, expected
shortly for IDA's approval. The redefined project i, now expected to be
completed by May 1977, six months behind the original schedule.

522 Madhya Pradesh Dair   Development Project' US$16.4 million credit
of December 1 , 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1962
These three credits totalling US$74.1 million support dairy development
projects organized along the lines of the successful AMUL dairy cooperative
scheme in Gujarat State. The Karnataka Credit became effective on December 23,
1974. The Karnataka Dairy Development Corporation (.UDC) has been established,
and senior management staff appointed. Some progress has been made in planning
and training of specialized teams and in preparing a banking plan, but the
project is about 4 months behind schedule at this early stage largely due to
insufficient staffing of the KDDC, which is responsible for project implementation.
The Madhya Pradesh credit became effective on July 23, 1975. Conditions of ef'fect-
iveness for the Rajasthan credit will have to be fulfilled by August 15, 1975.

This loan and this credit became effective on December 12, 1974.
Both projects are generally proceeding satisfactorily. In particular, agri-
cultural extension has made remarkable progress. A recent supervision mission
for both projects reported that land development had not yet started. Ways to
overcome this delay are presently being discussed with GOI and the project
authorities.
