APPRAISAL OF A THIRTEENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Draft Indian Fifth Five-Year Plan 1974/75-1978/79 as pre-
pared in 1973 envisaged an increase of about 32% in ton-km of railway
freight and of about 20% in railway passenger traffic over the five-year
period on the basis of a predicted 5.5% annual real growth in GNP. Adverse
economic developments during the past two years - escalation of the prices
of fuel and other essential commodities combined with a stagnant economy
and strained industrial relations -- have necessitated a reassessment of
the development plans. The targets for the various sectors are being
modified.
ii.       The Government of India (GOI) has, however, decided that the targets
for the core sector of the economy -- essentially energy, coal, steel, heavy
industries, cement, fertilizer -- should by and large be maintained.
Because of the Government's resource position, the decision will result
in relatively large cuts for other sectoral programs, including transport.
Indian Railways (IR) has reduced its freight traffic forecast for 1978/79
by 12% and the proposed project and credit have been prepared on this
basis. On the average, however, 1974/75 prices were about 35% higher than
the 1972/73 prices used in the preparation of the Draft Fifth Plan; a further
20% increase is expected by the end of the project period in 1976/77. There-
fore, in order to keep within the original investment outlay of Rs. 23.5
billion (US$3.0 billion equivalent) for the 1974/75-1978/79 period, IR cut
back on planned real investment. The reduction has become possible because
of the lower traffic forecast, but some of it is to be achieved through the
implementation of an action plan for substantial improvements in the utili-
zation of existing assets.
iii.      The proposed project, which would consist of IR's revised invest-
ment program for the two years 1975/76-1976/77, is estimated to cost
Rs. 7,928 million (US$1,010 million equivalent). It will enable the Govern-
ment and IR to continue with the production of locomotives and rolling
stock at present levels, whereas the original program anticipated a sub-
stantial increase. It will also enable IR to continue with track renewal,
electrification, line capacity and other works already in progress, al-
though at a rate about 35% lower than originally estimated. Included in
the project is a provision for import of necessary spare parts for mainte-
nance of locomotives and rolling stock.
iv.       The total foreign exchange requirement during the project period
is estimated at US$154.2 million equivalent, of which US$122.6 million
equivalent would be required to support the investment program (foreign
exchange component 12.4%), while US$31.6 million would be required for
import of necessary maintenance spare parts. According to the proposed



- ii -
financing plan, US$110.0 million equivalent would be met from the proceeds
of the proposed IDA credit, US$20.0 million equivalent would be financed
out of the remaining proceeds of the present credit 448-IN (Twelfth Railway
Project), while the remaining US$24.2 million equivalent would be financed
through Government and bilateral sources.
v.        The present credit 448-IN was originally expected to be fully
disbursed by March 31, 1975, but because of a slow-down in manufacturing
programs as a result of lower than expected traffic growth, it is now
estimated to last about four months longer, to the end of July 1975. The
proposed credit would therefore cover payments over a period of 20 months,
from August 1975, to March 1977.
vi.       The covenants of Credit 448-IN required IR to prepare a long-term
Corporate Plan and to earn sufficient net revenue to enable IR to meet out
of internally generated resources, all operating expenses and dividend payments
of about 5.5% on its capital-at-charge. The preparation of the Corporate Plan
is well in progress and the earnings situation indicates that for 1974/75
IR's adjusted earnings of about Rs 1305 million 1/ (US$166 million equiva-
lent) would be about 70% of the dividend payment thereby satisfying the
requirements of the covenant. For subsequent years the forecasts also indi-
cate that the earnings will be sufficient to meet the dividend in full as
required by the covenant but there are already indications that for 1975/76
and 1976/77 there are likely to be substantial increases in costs which
cannot yet be quantified. It will require major efforts on the part of
GOI and IR to maintain the balance between costs and revenues.
vii.      IDA financed items will be procured by application of international
competitive bidding procedures in accordance with Bank guidelines, except
for about US$20.0 million (18.2% of the total credit), which would be used to
purchase special standard components and equipment required in the manufac-
ture of diesel and electric locomotives and for replacements during mainte-
nance. For similar reasons, under the two preceding credits, 280-IN
(Eleventh Project) and 448-IN (Twelfth Project), 23% and 20% respectively
of the total credit amount was excluded from international competitive bid-
ding. The financing of such items from IDA has thus been slowly reduced.
viii.     The proposed project provides a suitable basis for an IDA credit
of US$110 million equivalent to the Government of India on the usual
terms.
1/   The latest estimated figure is Rs. 885 million, but this was after
charging personnel costs of Rs. 420 million relating to 1973/74.



INDIA
APPRAISAL OF A THIRTEENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of India and Indian Railways (IR) have asked IDA
for a credit of US$110 million equivalent to assist in financing the pro-
curement of equipment required in the on-going program of locomotive and
rolling stock production and maintenance and of track and other works during
the years 1975/76 and 1976/77, which are the second and third years of IR's
Five-Year Investment Program 1974/75-1978/79. The credit would help to
finance IR's foreign exchange requirements over a 20-month period from
August 1, 1975 to March 31, 1977. The covenants of Credit 448-IN required
IR to prepare a long-term Corporate Plan and to earn sufficient net revenue
to enable IR to meet out of internally generated resources, all operating
expenses and dividend payments of about 5.5% on its capital-at-charge. The
preparation of the Corporate Plan is well in progress and IR is expected to
have a net operating surplus during the Fifth Plan period 1974/75-1978/79,
although this may not in some years be sufficient to meet the full dividend
liability.
1.02      Transport capacity to be planned and provided by IR is closely
tied to the needs of the coal, power, steel and related heavy industries
which comprise the so-called core sector of the economy; this sector
generates about 80%Xof IR's total revenue-earning freight traffic. The
Draft Fifth Five-Year Plan 1974/75-1978/79 established production targets
for the core sector and IR is required to provide corresponding transport
facilities. The physical Plan targets are, however, being revised because
of adverse economic developments during the past two years. The proposed
project has been designed to permit IR to provide the transport capacity
now expected to be required by March 1977 on the basis of an assessment
made by IDA of the likely traffic development during the whole Plan period
taking into account prior Bank economic and sector work on India. The final
outcome of the Government's reappraisal of the Draft Plan is likely to be
available at the time of preparation of the 1976/77 budget, but the Government
had already decided in 1974 that the targets for the core sector were to be
maintained.
1.03      Since 1949, the Bank Group has made six loans and six credits
for IR, a gross total of US$786.5 million equivalent; the only cancellation
was of US$1.20 million of the first loan. Previous lending operations have
been satisfactorily completed and have assisted IR to triple the volume of
freight carried and to more than double its passenger traffic between 1951
and 1974. The last credit (448-IN) was made in December 1973 for US$80
million equivalent; this should be fully disbursed by the end of July 1975.
1.04      Other Bank Group lending for transportation in India has consisted
of three loans and one credit for the ports of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay
(a total of US$81 million equivalent, US$8.69 million subsequently cancelled),



- 2 -
one credit for roads (US$60 million equivalent,US$0.53 million subsequently
cancelled), one loan for civil aviation (US$5.6 million equivalent), and
one credit for shipping (US$83 million equivalent). These lending operations,
which were mainly undertaken 10 to 15 years ago, have been satisfactorily
completed. Also, IDA has assisted in financing the import requirements of
commercial vehicle manufacture in the ten Industrial Imports credits made
between 1964 and 1975.
1.05      This appraisal report is based on information supplied by the
Government of India and IR and on the findings of a 3ank mission in March/
April 1975 comprising Messrs. Rahkonen (Economist), Tachibana (Engineer),
Buratti (Engineer) and Purvis (Financial Analyst, Consultant).
II. BACKGROUND
A. Indian Economy and Railways
2.01      Indian Railways (IR), besides being an important passenger carrier,
is closely linked with the industrialized part of the Indian economy, partic-
ularly its extractive and heavy industries. Bulk commodities, such as coal,
iron and steel, ores, cement, limestone, fertilizer and petroleum products
account for about 80% of railway freight traffic in ton-km. In addition,
the remaining 20% includes several commodities used by these industries
(chemicals, machinery, etc.). Therefore, the railway's freight traffic
development depends closely on the performance of these industries. This
dependence has increased over time; in 1951/52, these bulk commodities cons-
tituted about 60% of the railway's freight traffic.
2.02      Consequently, the reliability of railway traffic forecasts depends
on the extent to which the extractive and heavy industries are able to real-
ize their development plans. The target for revenue earning railway freight
at the end of the Fourth Plan in 1973/74 was initially 260 million tons.
This was revised to 230 million tons during a mid-term review of the Plan,
while the actual traffic attained was 162 million tons. The target for the
end of the Fifth Plan in 1978/79 was in 1973 established at 255 million tons.
The project has been based on a reduced estimate of 230 million revenue
earning tons in 1978/79.
2.03      A close examination of the reasons for these shortfalls indicates
that the crucial factor has been the slower than planned development of two
key sectors - - - power and steel - - - and the related performance of ex-
tractive industries such as coal and iron ore mining. Shortfalls from plan
targets for these two sectors alone accounted for some 66 million tons of
the total shortfall in forecast rail traffic during the Fourth Plan period.
Shortfalls in export of iron ore and production of cement accounted for an-
other 15 million tons. However, the railways themselves have to some extent
contributed to these shortfalls through disruptions and slow-down in train



- 3 -
services resulting mainly from difficulties in industrial relations which
culminated in May 1974 in a nation-wide railway strike (para. 3.03).
B. The Transport Sector
2.04      Although the major part of IR's freight traffic has been generated
by a limited number of heavy industries, the railways have traditionally been
the main mode of motorized transport in India and retained their relative
position more or less unchanged up to the beginning of the 1950's. 1/ At
that time their share of motorized land transport was estimated at 90% of
total ton kilometers (ton-km) and 75% of total passenger kilometers (pass-km).
2.05      During the period 1950/51-1970/71, while motorized freight and
passenger transport increased annually by 7.0% and 4.9% respectively, the
railways' share was reduced to 63% of total freight and to 50% of total pas-
senger traffic, with a corresponding increase in the share of road transport.
The relatively poor performance of heavy industries requiring transport of
bulk commodities has been the main factor in the railways' inability to re-
tain their former share of total freight traffic. In addition, because of
its inherent advantages, highway transport gradually captured a greater share
of the market for high value goods moving over short and medium distances
(Annex 1). This development has tended to reduce the area of competition
between the two modes and they have become increasingly complementary to
each other in transport of freight. In respect of passenger traffic, the
main reason for the reduced relative share of railways is that long dis-
tance passenger traffic has tended to increase at a slower rate than that
for short distance (commuter) traffic because of continuing rapid urbanization.
The short distance traffic can generally be carried more economically by road,
and the railways have made some efforts through tariff policy to promote
diversion of this traffic from rail to road. The composition and expected
development of railway traffic are summarized in paras. 6.02 to 6.05.
2.06      Compared with railways and highway transport, the other modes of
transport are at present of minor importance as general goods and passenger
carriers: coastal shipping and pipelines each carry about 3% of the total
freight traffic in terms of ton-kni; air transport carries about 1% of the
total pass-km. These modes perform, however, an important function within
their specialized areas. There is also scope for considerable expansion
within each of the modes because of the size of the country (coastal ship-
ping and air transport), its geographical features (coastal shipping and
pipelines), and because of gradually increasing advantages to be derived
from economies of scale (each of these modes requires fairly high throughput
1/   In rural areas, however, with about 80% of India's population, tra-
ditional means of non-motorized transport -- provided mainly by animal
drawn vehicles -- dominate the local transport market.



-4-
volumes because of their high capital utilization ratios).  Consequently
increased attention is being given to their development; expansion of
coastal shipping and the pipeline system are under active consideration by
the Government.
C. Transport Policy and Planning
2.07      In recognition of the need to implement and update the recommenda-
tions contained in the 1966 Final Report of the GOI Committee on Transport
Policy and Coordination, it was agreed during the negotiations for the
Eleventh Railway Credit (280-IN) in 1971, that the Government would, by the
latter part of 1973, complete a review of the transport sector. This review
was completed in November 1973. Subsequently, a transport review mission
visited India in April 1974. It identified as the most urgent issues im-
proved sector management and project preparation and implementation, par-
ticularly in face of the considerable efforts required for a successful
implementation of the Fifth Five-Year Plan and the simultaneous need to
improve the utilization of existing assets. The mission recognized that the
various issues relating to transport policy and planning could only be solved
gradually and would require a continuous dialogue among Government departments.
The mission's findings were communicated to the Government in July 1974. The
Government has since responded positively to most of the recommendations.
There are two outstanding issues -- the need to centralize in one Government
agency the railway functions relating to overall transport sector management
and planning and the desirability of subjecting IR investment programs to
Public Investment Board (PIB) scrutiny. These are being reviewed by the
Government.. It was agreed during negotiations that the Government would
keep the Association informed about decisions taken concerning these two
matters and about any other developments within the sector.
2.08      The Government has recently considerably strengthened the position
of the planning units in the two most important transport ministries --
Railways, and Shipping and Transport -- dealing with transport. In the
Ministry of Railways, corporate planning cells have now been established in
all Zonal Railways, and the Economic Unit in the Railway Board is being
more closely associated with operational and technical planning at an early
stage of the project cycle. In the Ministry of Shipping and Transport, the
Technical Services unit has been strengthened to improve on past, fairly
poor, performance in implementation, particularly of port projects, while the
Division of Transport Research has increasingly been associated with eco-
nomic evaluation of projects. In addition, the recently established Proj-
ect Appraisal Division (PAD) and Project Evaluation and Monitoring Unit
(PEMU) in the Planning Commission are expected to srutinize and monitor
the implementation of public sector investment projects for the economy as
a whole.
2.09       The Government is also gradually moving away from primarily rail-
way oriented transport planning by seeking feasible solutions to capacity



-5-
problems within other modes of transport. An example of this approach is
the proposed project for shipping of coal from Bengal/Bihar coalfields to
power stations and other major coal consumers in Southern and Western India.
This project has been under preparation for some tiae, and may involve Asso-
ciation financing. Another example is the planned construction of pipelines
parallel to main railway sections in difficult terrain, with the purpose of
relieving congestion on railways and avoiding the considerably higher costs
involved in expansion of railway capacity in these areas.
D. Transport Sector Investment Plans
2.10      The Draft Fifth Five-Year Plan 1974/75-1978/79 drawn up in 1973
allocated Rs. 66.5 billion (US$8.5 billion equivalent) for investments in
the transport sector including Rs. 11.0 billion, (US$1.4 billion equiv-
alent), for communications. This represented 18.8% of the total Draft Plan
outlay of about Rs. 355 billion (US$45 billion equivalent) and compares with
18.5% spent during the Fourth Plan period 1969/70-1973/74 and with 23.6%
spent during the first three Plan periods. Of the total of Rs. 66.5 billion,
Rs. 23.5 billion (US$3.0 billion equivalent) is allocated to the Railways
(including provision for replacement outlays). Table 1 gives the allocation
of the transport sector outlays in the Fourth and Draft Fifth Plans by modes
of transport. The 1975/76 budget indicates that the relative share for trans-
port and communications will be reduced (para. 4.03). The railways 1974/75-
1978/79 investment program, as revised by IR, is discussed in paras. 4.01
to 4.05.
-II. INDIAN RAILWAYS -/
A. Organization, Management and Staff
3.01      The IR network is owned and managed by the GOI.  Its operations
are controlled and directed by a Board of five members headed by a Chairman
who is ex-officio a Principal Secretary to the Government of India reporting
to the Minister of Railways. One Board member, the Financial Commissioner,
has discretionary power to report directly to the Minister of Finance on
financial matters. The Board, therefore, performs the dual functions of
a Secretariat to the Ministry of Railways and of an executive body responsible
for railway operations. In financial matters GOI exercises control through
Parliament on recommendations made by the Railway Convention Committee
and other parliamentary committees.
3.02      The IR is the nation's largest undertaking with an investment of
Rs. 4,791 crores (US$6 billion equivalent) and total staff strength of 1.7
1/   This chapter is an abridged version of Annex 2.



million. There are nine Zonal Railways, each of which is under the control
of a General Manager, and each zone is a large system on its own account.
IR also has three modern factories engaged in the manufacture of locomotives
and rolling stock. IR's organization is illustrated by Chart 9795.
3.03      There are two recognized staff federations covering about 70%
of all staff. During the latter part of 1973 and the first half of 1974
there was a succession of strikes and disputes, and while IR's Board has
taken steps to strengthen its personnel branch and welfare inspectorate
and to improve promotion prospects it will be essential for IR to be in-
creasingly active in handling labor relations in order co avoid future dis-
putes and unrest.
3.04      The quality of senior staff at Headquarters and in the Zonal
Railways is high and their professional knowledge of management techniques
and modern railway technology is excellent.
B. Accounts, Costing and Audit
3.05      Financial arrangements with the Government and audit procedures
have not changed since the appraisal report on the 12th railway credit was
prepared. Further details of these arrangements are shown in Annex 3.
However, certain improvements to accounting procedures have been introduced
including a system of exchequer control (Annex 4) to control cash more
stringently against budget allowances. Furthermore, the three task forces
established by IR to examine (a) budgetary, accounting and management
practices (Annex 5), (b) depreciation policy (Annex 6), and (c) restructuring
of capital have almost completed their work. The Board will review the
reports of the Task Forces before presenting the findings to the Convention
Committee. Implementation of the changes in procedure recommended by the
Task Forces will take time, but the Board accepts the need for such changes.
3.06      The accounts of IR are audited by the Director of Railway Audit,
Office of Comptroller and Auditor General, GOI. Audit arrangements are
thorough and satisfactory (Annex 3).
C. Rates and Fares
3.07      As of April 1, 1974, the rates and fares were increased on average
by 11.1% per pass-km and 12.4% per ton-km and in September, 1974, further
increases averaging 18.6% for passenger traffic and 21.7% for freight were
introduced.  The combined effect of these increases has been that the
average fare per pass-km has gone up by about 31%, while freight rates have
increased by about 36% per ton-lkm. These increases may appear high, but
they do no more than reflect the average inflation rate during the past
two years. A satisfactory feature was that the Government and IR took



-7-
corrective actions during the fiscal year 1974/75 instead of waiting for
presentation of the next year's budget.
3.08      The rates and fares were increased on a selective, traffic costing
basis by traffic and distance categories and the latest rate and fare in-
creases represent a distinct step towards cost-based tariffs. Rail freight
of coal over longer distances has in the past made an inadequate contribution
to fixed costs. However, coal freight rates were increased both in April
and September 1974 and are now believed to be meet their costs fully. The
following tabulation indicates the combined effect of the two rate increases
by distance categories:
Rates in Rs. per Ton

100        9.50    13.00   36.8         10.45    14.40    37.8
500       23.25    34.70   49.2         25.60    38.90    50.1
1000       36.80    60.50   56.7         42.50    68.10    60.1
1500       50.70    82.10   61.9         55.80    92.50    65.8
2000       61.60   100.70   63.5         67.80   113.60    67.7
The freight rates in most other categories have been increased by about 23%
for distances up to 100 km, gradually increasing to about 35% for distances
exceeding 2000 km. As a result, rates are adequate to cover freight traffic
costs fully, including depreciation of fixed assets. The most recent
revisions were made in presenting the 1975/76 budget and applied to foodstuffs
and iron and manganese ores.
3.09      A similar cost-based tariff policy has been applied towards pas-
senger fares. There have been substantial increases in all traffic cate-
gories, but particularly in short distance third class (recently renamed
second class) travel which in the past resulted in considerable losses to
the railways. However, the rate increases applied primarily to other than
commuter traffic, which still remains heavily subsidized, although there is
a clear desire within the Government to reduce the losses on this traffic
also.
D. Property
3.10      Track and Bridges.  IR operates over 60,000 route-km (Map 2523R2).
About 80% of total railway traffic in terms of gross ton-km is carried on the
30,000 km of broad gauge (BG). On BG lines, diesel and electric traction
hauls 65% of total gross ton-km with the remaining 35% being hauled by steam
traction. About 4,025 route-km, or only about 13% of the BG system, are
electrified, which appears low in view of the traffic densities. Details



- 8 -
of route-km by gauge, double-tracked route-km, electrified route-km and
track-km are given in Table 2. The total running track length of BG lines
is about 43,000 km, of which passenger express train routes, and other high
traffic density routes and suburban sections constitute about 24,000 km
(about 10,000 route-km), on which the average traffic density exceeds 20
million gross ton-km per year per route-km. Track maintenance organization,
performance and procedures are satisfactory. There are still 116 bridges on
BG lines with speed restrictions because of weaknesses in either superstructure
or substructure; these are being gradually improved. All bridges are subject
to a once-a-year inspection, which is satisfactory.
3.11      Locomotives.  At the end of 1973/74, on BG lines, there were 5,302
steam locomotives, 908 diesel electric mainline locomotives, 216 diesel
hydraulic shunters and 649 electric locomotives. About 15% of the total
steam locomotive fleet was over 40 years in age but, the majority is rela-
tively new, 37% of the total fleet being less than 17 years old. Traction
policy relating to conversion from steam to diesel and electric traction
was re-examined by IR after the energy crisis. It concluded that there
should not be any significant change in traction policy, although electri-
fication has in relative terms become slightly more economical. To obtain
the maximum benefit from further electrification, it is however essential to
make further efforts to reduce electric locomotive maintenance costs which
are at present higher than those for diesel locomotives. Efforts should also
be made to solve the remaining difficulties experienced in standardization
of AC (alternating current) electric locomotives. On the other hand, past
problems with traction motors have now been solved.
3.12      Passenger vehicles.  The present BG passenger vehicles include
about 19,000 passenger coaches, 1,700 electric multiple units (EMU's) and
26 diesel railcars. About 8% of the passenger coaches are over 40 years
of age.  The occupancy ratio remains high (70% and 95% passengers per
passenger coach and EMU car, respectively).
3.13      Freight wagons.  The present fleet of BG freight wagons consists
of about 290,GOO units, the equivalent of 385,500 four-wheelers. The
fleet is relatively new, only 4% being over 40 years old. Almost all
iron ore traffic and part of the coal traffic is hauled by unit trains
with new-type bogie wagons, but most of the coal is still carried by block
trains of conventional four-wheeler wagons. IR's motive power and rolling
stock position by gauge at the end of 1973/74 is given in Table 3.
3.14      Scrapping policy and Procedures.  IR bases its scrapping of loco-
motives and rolling stock on the actual condition of the stock. However,
in the case of wagons, IR allows their scrapping to be postponed for
several months depending on fluctuations in traffic demand. The scrapping
decision is based on a comparative technical and financial study with
and without scrapping.
3.15      Workshop and running shed operations.  IR has 41 workshops (six
major, 20 medium and 15 minor) in addition to running sheds. Their organi-
zation and maintenance operations are generally satisfactory. However,



-9-
some imported spare parts are not readily available in workshops and run-
ning sheds, and this prolongs days in shop for the stock but also contri-
butes to some deterioration in the availability of, particularly, diesel
locomotives. Because of this, a unit exchange policy is gradually being
introduced; it involves concentration of components and parts rebuilding
to specially designated workshops.
E. Manufacturing Units
3.16      IR manufactures all its diesel and electric locomotives, most
of its passenger vehicles, and a small proportion of its wagons, most of
which are manufactured by private wagon builders. Locomotive production
still requires imports of essential materials and components, but steady
if somewhat slow progress is being made toward complete indigeneous pro-
duction. The workshops are efficient and the products -- particularly
mainline diesel locomotives -- have proven to be reliable in service and
their cost less than the c.i.f. cost of imported locomotives and rolling
stock. A production program of locomotives and rolling stock under IR's
Investment Program 1974/75-1978/79 is given in Table 4.
F. Operating Performance
3.17      IR's operating performance for the period 1969/70-1974/75 (April-
December) is shown in Table 5 for BG and MG lines. Performance is general-
ly satisfactory except for wagon turnround which should be improved 1/.
Average gross freight trailing load averaging about 1,400 tons is remark-
able and well exceeds that of the German Federal Railway and French National
Railways. Net ton-km per year per ton of wagon capacity (14,000 ton-km) is
good and about double that of the German Federal Railway and French National
Railways. Wagon turnround, 15 days in 1973/74, is high and was largely a
result of low traffic volume. The wagon turnround has however been improving
(13.8 days in December 1974) with increased traffic. To further improve
wagon turnround times, IR worked out, on request of the Association, an
Action Plan for targets to be achieved for the two years 1975/76 and 1976/77
(Annex 7). The Association will be kept informed of the results of actual
performance and corrective measures to be taken, on a biannual basis (April/
May and October/November) during the Project period.  The Action Plan and
reporting requirements thereon were confirmed during negotiations.
G. Performance Under Previous Credits
3.18      Covenants entered into under Credit 448-IN included an earnings
covenant and a requirement to prepare and keep up to date a Corporate Plan.
1/   Comparison with two European railways of similar size is made in
Table 6.



- 10 -
The earnings covenant required IR to earn sufficient revenue to meet all
operating expenses and the dividend payable to the Government but because
of an exceptionally heavy increase in personnel costs in 1973 resulting from
a Pay Commission award, requirements of the earnings covenant for 1973/74
were waived at the time of negotiating the Twelfth Credit.
3.19      In negotiating Credit 448-IN it was also agreed that earnings
should be sufficient in 1974/75 and 1975/76 to meet only 70% and approxi-
mately 85% respectively of the dividend payments due in those years, because
of the financial difficulties then foreseen. Accounts for 1974/75 are not
yet finalized but the latest figures show that net rer-anue from operations
is expected to be Rs 885 million. Since the operating expenses include
Rs 420 million for personnel costs relating to the previous year, the "ad-
justed't net revenue for 1974/75, for purposes of judging performance against
the earnings covenant, would amount to Rs 1305 million which is equivalent
to 69.05% of the dividend payment or very nearly the 70% required by the
covenant.
3.20      In the Twelfth credit (448-IN) agreement was reached to appropri-
ate Rs 1200 million and Rs 1250 million to Depreciation Reserve Fund 1/ (DRF)
for the years 1974/75 and 1975/76 respectively. The revised estimate for
1974/75 and the budget estimate for 1975/76, make appropriations which are
Rs 50 million and Rs 100 million less respectively. However, the Railway
Board has indicated that while the Railway Board's own proposals to the
Convention Committee for DRF allocations in the Fifth Plan would have been
fully consistent with the covenant, the Committee took an interim decision
pending the report of the Working Party on Depreciation. During negotiations
the Association expressed concern that the charges for depreciation were
not in accordance with the amounts stipulated in the Twelfth Credit but
accepted the reasons leading to the changed decisions. The new Credit (para
5.11) provides that a global sum of Rs 6,500 million shall be appropriated
to DRF during the Fifth Plan and that not less than Rs 1300 million shall
be charged in each of the years 1976/77 through 1978/79.
3.21      An initial version of IR's Corporate Plan was completed in January
1974 and work is now proceeding on the substantive version of the Plan which
should be ready by June 1976. Corporate Planning cells have been established
in each Zonal Railway and their work is being coordinated from the Board's
own Corporate Planning Cell which has been assisted by the Association's
consultant, Mr. K. V. Smith (TRANSMARK, U.K.). This work is progressing well.
H. Railway Planning
3.22      The planning, evaluation and project sanctioning system applied
by IR is defined in the various railway codes and policy directives and
1/   DRF is defined in Annex 3, footnote 1.



- 11 -
summarized in Annex 8. The railways' internal planning is mainly under-
taken for preparation of annual investment and work programs. According
to this system, no project costing more than Rs. 0.5 million (US$65,000
equivalent) can be sanctioned by the Railway Board and included in the an-
nual program without a project study based on a comprehensive techno-
economic survey. The evaluation criteria have in most cases been technical
and financial.  Comprehensive economic studies are undertaken for major new
works (gauge conversion and electrification schemes, new lines, etc.). Em-
phasis is also being given to further development of project evaluation tech-
niques, data base and evaluation of alternatives.
3.23      After discussions with the Association, IR confirmed that the
scope of work of the Economic Unit would develop on the following lines:
(a) it should increasingly become a supervising unit in line with other de-
partments in the Railway Board; (b) it should be closely associated with
the corporate planning work (which so far has been directed by the IR Plan-
ning Department alone); (c) it should become involved with project prepara-
tion work at its early stages on the Zonal Railway level; and (d) in line
with these changes it should be authorized to issue guidelines and supervise
techno-economic project feasibility studies to ensure that due account is
taken of economic considerations.
IV. THE PLAN AND THE PROPOSED PROJECT
A. IR's Investment Program 1974/75-1978/79
4.01      The proposed Thirteenth Railway Project is designed to meet the
railways investment requirements during the two financial years 1975/76-1976/77.
These two years form part of IR's Fifth Five-Year Investment Program 1974/75-
1978/79. The Program, amounting to Rs. 23.5 billion (about US$3.0 billion
equivalent), was drawn up in 1973 on the basis of the Draft National Fifth
Five-Year Development Plan 1974/75-1978/79. However, as discussed in para.
1.02 above, much of the Draft Plan became outdated before it could be imple-
mented because of the adverse economic developments of the past 2-3 years.
The most serious problem has been inflation; tcie 1975/76 price level is about
50% higher than in 1972/73, which was used as a basis in preparation of the
Draft Plan. Although inflation has now slowed down, a number of physical
targets in the Draft Plan have been obviously affected.
4.02      The Govermuent realized the need to revise the Draft Plan in
early 1974, immediately after the increase in oil prices, but rightly
decided that the revision of the Plan should wait until stabilization of
the economy. It now appears likely that the revised Plan will be avail-
able at the time of preparation of the 1976/77 annual plan and budget.
The Government did however decide in 1974, that the physical targets for
the core sector of the economy (essentially power and heavy industries and
minerals) should be maintained unchanged.  These sectors generate the bulk
of the railways freight traffic (para. 2.01).



- 12 -
4.03      As a result of the reduced allocation for the transport and com-
munications sector, the railways 1975/76 capital works budget was approved
at Rs. 3,180 million, compared with the Rs. 3,600 million requested on the
basis of IR's 1974/75-1978/79 Investment Program; the reduction was about
12%, or about the same as for the whole sector. In real terms, however the
reduction was considerably more, because of an average price increase of
35% between 1972/73 and 1974/75, for which no provision was made in prepara-
tion of the 1974/75-1978/79 investment program. In addition, further price
increases of about 10% a year are expected during the project period 1975/76-
1976/77. As a result of the reduction in funds allocated for capital works
in 1975/76, the 35% price increase from 1973 to 1975 and the annual 10%
price increase expected for the two project years, IRVs investment program
has been substantially reduced in real terms. The reduction has been
particularly severe for investments in rolling stock, because most of the
budget reduction was under this plan head.
4.04      In reviewing IR's 1974/75-1978/79 investment program in physical
terms (Table 8) it was assumed that a substantial part of the expected
increase in rail traffic will be carried by utilizing the present excess
capacity (about 25 million tons) during the project period 1975/76-1976/77.
This can be achieved through better utilization of wagons as outlined in
Annex 7. Although investments in additional capacity will also be required
during the project period, most of these investments will be undertaken
during the last two years (1977/78-1978/79) of the investment period.
4.05      Although the revised investment program as a whole realistically
reflects investment requirements as foreseen at present, it will be
necessary to undertake, at the time of preparation of the annual plan and
budget for 1977/78, a review of the program for the last two years of the
investment period.
B. The Project
4.06      The Project is the investment program to be partly financed by
the proceeds of the proposed Credit and covers the two years 1975/76 and
1976/77. The Project consists of new and ongoing works which are required
to continue with cost reduction measures, including modernization of
equipment, and to meet a projected increase in demand for freight and
passenger services. The main elements of the Project are the construction
and putting into service of about 350 locomotives, about 300 electric multiple
units (EMU's), about 1,500 coaches and about 20,000 wagons (four-wheeler equiva-
lent). The Project also includes electrification, track works, bridge
works, and modernization in workshops and sheds. In addition, it includes
imports of spare parts necessary for maintenance of locomotives and rolling
stock, plant and machinery, and other equipment for tracks, and signalling,
telecommunications and electrification facilities. Details are given in
Annex 9.



- 13 -
4.07     The total investment cost of the Project amounts to Rs 7,680 mil-
lion (US$978.4 million equivalent), with a foreign exchange content of
US$122.6 million equivalent, or 12.4%. In addition, an estimated Rs 248
million (US$31.6 million equivalent) would be required for spare parts,
making the total Project cost Rs 7,928 million (US$1,010 million equivalent)
with a foreign exchange content-of US$154.2 million equivalent. The esti-
mated expenditures are summarized in the following table:

4.08     The Project cost is based on 1974/75 nrices adjusted for price
escalation by about 20% over the two years 1975/76 and 1976/77. Detailed
cost estimates for locomotives and rolling stock are given in Annex 10. No
general provision for price contingencies is required because the unit
prices already include a 20% price escalation and because the Project is
part of an ongoing investment program, the physical content of which will be
adjusted in line with actual price increases and changes in budgetary
allocations.
4.09      The foreign exchange cost is the total estimated cost of IR's
foreign procurement. Apart from US$27.5 million equivalent required for
specialized machinery and equipment, rails, bridge materials, signalling
and telecommunications equipment, and equipment and materials for electri-
fication, most of IR's foreign exchange expenditures for investments are to
be used to procure components and materials required for the manufacture
of diesel and electric locomotives and rolling stock. The estimated foreign
exchange requirements under the various plan heads are reasonable. Procure-
ment of these components and materials is a continuous process to maintain
manufacturing operations at a planned level of production.



-14 
4.10      The foreign exchange requirements for maintenance spare parts for
locomotives and rolling stock have been estimated by IR at US$30.1 million
equivalent. IR requires a further US$1.5 million equivalent for maintenance
spares for plant and machinery and other equipment, making the total re-
quirement US$31.6 million equivalent. These requirements are reasonable.
Out of this total, US$15.6 million equivalent is to be financed under the
proposed Credit; US$4.5 million equivalent will be financed under the
previous credit (448-IN), while the balance of US$11.5 million equivalent
would be financed from Government and bilateral sources.
C. Financing of The Project
4.11      IR's financing plan during the two fiscal years in which the
Project is to be completed is shown and discussed in paras 5.16 to 5.19.
The proposed IDA Credit would contribute to the financing of the foreign
exchange content of the Project with respect to payments made from the
date of signing the proposed Credit Agreement. Payments made before that
date would be covered from other sources, including IDA credit 448-IN. Of
the proposed Credit, 74% is allocated to locomotives and rolling stock; the
foreign exchange component for these items (26%) is higher than would be
the case if sufficient domestically produced materials and components were
available. Items to be financed under the Credit are detailed in Annex 11.
D. Execution of The Project, Procurement and Disbursement
4.12      IR will be responsible for the implementation of the Project as
part of its ongoing works and manufacturing program. It has the necessary
facilities and is competent to carry out the Project.
4.13      Items to be financed by the Association under the Credit will
consist of: (a) complete pieces of machinery and equipment ready for use
on IR; (b) assemblies or components to be incorporated in the manufacture
of locomotives, rolling stock and equipment in India; (c) materials,
principally steel, to be used by IR or its contractors in India for pro-
ducing rolling stock and railway equipment, and (d) necessary spare parts
for maintenance of locomotives and rolling stock. In connection with (b) and
(c), wagons are mostly manufactured by local firms in the private sector,
to which IR supplies wheelsets and/or steel financed by the Association.
IR procurement from the private sector is based on competitive bidding but
final contract prices are determined by IR on a negotiated basis, taking
account of the quantity ordered from each firm.
4.14      The Association financed items will be procured by IR through
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines except
for: (a) proprietary items which IR procures from particular sources be-
cause of the need for procurement under license or for continued standardiza-
tion of equipment; (b) non-ferrous metals (para 4.17) such as tin and lead;



- 15 -
and (c) contracts of US$50,000 equivalent or less, where the advantage of
ICB would be clearly outweighed by the administrative burden involved
(para. 4.19).
4.15      Proprietary items, as defined under Category 8 in Annex 11, have
been limited to US$20 million equivalent, or to 18.2% of the Credit (20%
under Credit 448-IN). The total requirement during the Project period is
estimated at US$33.3 million equivalent. The Government and IR have made
considerable efforts to encourage indigenous production and to reduce imports
of these items, but India is still experiencing difficulty in this respect.
In addition, the Government has experienced difficulty in arranging finance
for these items from bilateral and other sources.
4.16      The public sector procurement of non-ferrous metals is the respons-
ibility of the Metals and Minerals Trading Corporation (MMTC) of India, a
Government agency. It is therefore appropriate that IR requirements of non-
ferrous metals are procured in accordance with MMTC procedures as agreed
with the Association in connection with the Tenth Industrial Imports Credit,
which also provides for the procurement of these metals. For this reason,
this item is shown under a separate category (Annex 11). IR has agreed with
these arrangements.
4.17      Under Credit 448-IN, contract awards by IR exceeding US$1.0 million
required prior approval by the Association except for certain specified
items (steel, non-ferrous metals, wheels, tires, axles and wheelsets), which
were exempted from the need for the Association's prior approval in view of
the very short validity of bids under then prevailing market conditions.
Since those market conditions have now changed considerably, it is not pro-
posed to continue the exemption in its present form. Provision has been made
in the Credit Agreement that, in the case of tenders for steel, where bid
validity is 21 days or less, the Borrower may proceed to evaluation and
award, subject to advising the Association of the details of the bids received
and having received no objections from the Association.
4.18      For IR contracts between US$50,000 and US$1 million equivalent,
contract documents will be forwarded after award but, as in the past,
documentation covering bid analysis and other relevant information will be
provided only if so requested by the Association. The total amount of con-
tracts less than US$50,000 equivalent not subject to ICB represents only a
small portion (less than US$4 million equivalent) of the proposed Credit.
4.19      Subject to review and agreement with the Association, savings in
any category of the proceeds of the proposed Credit will be available to
cover increases in any other category except for proprietary items under
Category 8 in Annex 11. Disbursements are expected to be completed by
March 31, 1977, but in order to allow time for possible late payments, the
closing date will be September 30, 1977. The proposed credit would be
disbursed against the foreign exchange cost of imported equipment, components,
and materials. A schedule of estimated disbursements is shown in Annex 12.

4.20      The proposed Credit will be made to the Government of India on
the usual IDA terms.
V. FINANCES AND EARNINGS
A. Introduction
5.01      The Government of India requires Indian Railways to pursue a
financial policy which will result in the earning of net revenues which
are sufficient to meet the dividend payment 1/ due to the Government on
capital provided to the Railway, and to earn a small surplus out of which
minor capital investment can be financed.
5.02      Until recently, IR generally was able to meet its dividend lia-
bility of about 5.5% on its capital-at-charge and to continue to finance
a significant portion of its investment program. This it achieved despite
maintaining low freight tariffs and passenger fares, but the position in
recent years has been affected by low national economic growth.  As a
consequence of slower traffic growth, Indian Railways was therefore forced
to adopt a more financially-oriented policy and to examine its financial
accounting and control methods.
5.03      Task Forces have been working in detail on financial policy, ac-
counting systems, budgeting methods and future depreciation policy. Traffic
costing is now an integral part of tariff formulation, leading increasingly
to the elimination of freight subsidies and implementation of a policy of
cost - related tariffs.
B. Past Performance
5.04      Table 9 shows IR revenue and expenditure accounts for the 6 years
to 1974/75. In each of the three years to March 1973 improved traffic
volume enabled IR to generate a net financial surplus and after taking
account of some relief in the method of calculating the dividend on capital-
at-charge by reference to unremunerative works, IR was able to meet the
dividend payments due to the Government.
5.05       In the last two years, IR's fuel costs have been affected materially
by the increase in world oil prices; personnel costs increased from 57% to
over 63% of working expenses; passenger and freight traffic volume was at
a low level; all these factors meant that net operating revenues in the
1/   Dividends are more in the nature of interest on permanent capital
provided by the Government (see Annex 3).



- 17 -
two years 1973/74 and 1974/75 were inadequate to meet the full dividend
liability to the Government. Consequently there was a net deficit of
Rs 1.15 billion in 1973/74 and an estimated deficit of Rs 1.28 billion 1/
for 1974/75 after payment of dividend on capital-at-charge. The operating
ratio increased from 84.5 in 1972/73 to 93.7 and 94.4 in the two subsequent
years.
5.06      In order to meet its full dividend liabilities and expenditures
charged to Development Fund, IR had to take temporary loans from the Govern-
ment. By the end of FY 1973, these loans amounted to Rs 0.9 billion. Be-
cause surpluses in 1973/74 and 1974/75 were inadequate to meet the full
dividend liability, Development Fund expenditure and loan repayments,
temporary loans had increased by the end of 1974/75 to an estimated level
of Rs 3.8 billion. These loans have been obtained from Government mainly to
enable IR to make the dividend payments due to the Government. The build-up
of temporary loans is to some extent associated with the heavy social burdens
on the railway finances together with the demand for investment in backward
areas, the growing commuter traffic and the tendency to impose a ceiling on
short distance passenger fares (see para 5.13).
5.07      The balance sheet of IR at March 31, 1974, is shown in Table 10.
The value of fixed assets is not shown either at historical cost or at re-
placement cost; their values represent the original cost of assets plus
any improvements when subsequently replaced. The inflation element in the
cost of replacements is charged against DRF and does not become reflected
in the fixed asset values. The amount of Government capital-at-charge ap-
proximately corresponds to what would normally be regarded as the value of
net fixed assets. Return on capital-at-charge dropped from an average of
4.6% over the years leading to 1972/73 to 1.4% and 1.5% (estimated) in
1973/74 and 1974/75 respectively.
Forecast Performance
5.08      In judging the financial performance of Indian Railways, the recent
past should be put in perspective. Many of the events reported above were
outside the control of Indian Railways and could hardly have been foreseen.
The relative stagnation in the economy resulting in lack of traffic growth,
made gross receipts inadequate to meet increased operating costs and divi-
dend payments.
5.09      It is reasonable therefore to start an appraisal of the future
on the basis that the position now is materially better than it was a year
ago. The 1975/76 budget, presented to Parliament in February 1975, budgets
for a surplus of Rs 230 million. The forecast on which this estimate is based
appears to be realistic.
1/   Subject to final revision.



- 18 -
5.10      Table 11 presents a forecast of revenues and expenditures for the
period 1975/76 up to 1979/80. The prices used in this presentation are, for
rates, fares and expenses, at April 1975 levels. The forecasts take account
of the three major factors which have occurred over the past two years: the
full effects of the tariff increases (including the removal of the foodgrain
and ore subsidies from April 1975) are incorporated in the forecasts; fuel
costs reflect the revised pricing introduced for coal and diesel oil; and
labor costs take account of all allowances and adjustments sanctioned up to
March 1975.
5.11      The total appropriation to DRF in the Fifth ?lan is Rs 6,500 mil-
lion but one of the recommendations in the report of the Working Party on
Depreciation Policy (Annex 6) is that the total provision be Rs 7500 million
in order to preserve an adequate balance in the DRF. This recommendation
is considered sound since this figure would permit IR to continue to
generate about 40% of its total capital requirements and the annual charge
for depreciation would continue to be about 10% of gross receipts. However,
any increase in the present appropriation to DRF must await a recommendation
from the Convention Committee. Therefore it has been agreed that IR will
make appropriations to DRF of not less than Rs 6,500 million in the five
years 1974/75-1978/79 with a proviso that not less than Rs 1300 million will
be appropriated in each of the years 1976/77-1978/79.
5.12      Expected increases in traffic will be sufficient to progressively
cover increased charges for depreciation and dividends on capital. Revenue
and expenditure estimates are based on the April 1975 price level. For
1975/76, the budget estimates suggest that the dividend liability will be met
in full from earnings. However, recent developments indicate that there may
be substantial increases in cost of coal and personnel. Since tariff in-
creases already introduced during 1974 and 1975 have been very heavy, it
may be difficult for the GOI to make further increases in the near future
to compensate for increased costs.
5.13      While there may be some prospect of IR's earnings being insuf-
ficient to meet dividend payments in full for 1975/76 and 1976/77, it is
important that steps should be taken, not only to achieve earnings to pay
dividends but in addition to generate cash surpluses to permit allocation
of funds to the Development Fund to cover expenditures of a capital nature
which are expected to increase from the present level of about Rs 200 million
a year to double that figure by 1979/80. In addition to these requirements
IR needs surpluses to be able to repay the temporary loans provided by
Government in past years. Solutions to these problems must await recommenda-
tions of the Convention Committee which is kept fully informed by the IR
Board.
5.14      The Source and Application of Funds statement, Table 12, shows that
the surpluses forecast to 1979/80 will be insufficient to meet all the re-
quirements referred to above. Temporary loans outstanding at March 1975
amounted to Rs 3,798 million and by 1980 it is estimated that they will in-
crease to Rs 5,604 million. Clearly this state of affairs cannot be allowed



- 19 -
to continue; the problem was discussed with IR's Board and during negotia-
tions an assurance was obtained that these problems have been communicated
to the Convention Committee whose report is awaited. Meanwhile, calculations
have been made showing that on present traffic forecasts, tariff increases
of more than 5% per annum would be required to cover provision for increased
costs and to eliminate the loans altogether by 1980.  Forecast Balance
Sheets for the period to 1980 are presented in Table 13. On the basis of
the forecast presented, retaining 1975 tariffs and costs, it is estimated
that IR can increase its return on capital from 1.4% to 4.8% by 1979/80.
5.15      Following the discussion of earnings in paras. 3.18-3.19 and 5.12,
it has been agreed that the provisions of Section 4.02 of Credit Agreement
448-IN, requiring IR to earn sufficient revenue to meet all operating ex-
penses and the dividend 1/ payable to the Government on its capital-at-charge,
will be equally applicable to the Thirteenth Credit.
D. Financing Plan
5.16      Table 12 shows the source and application of funds for the years
1974/75 to 1979/80. During the two years (1975/76 and 1976/77) in which
the proceeds of the proposed credit will be utilized, the funds required
by IR and the source of such funds will be as follows:
1/   At present about 5.5% of capital-at-charge.

5.17      The above financing plan is based on the present financial arrange-
ments (particularly with respect to dividends and temporary loans) between
the Government and IR. IR will be able to finance 39% of its total invest-
ment requirements out of net internally generated funds. The balance would
be provided by the Government, either in the form of an increase in capital-
at-charge, or in the form of temporary loans to be repaid from future reve-
nue surpluses. In accordance with present financial arrangements, IR is
required to repay loans obtained for dividend payments in the three years
following the year in which they were drawn but in 1975/76 and 1976/77 IR's
earnings will not be sufficient to repay earlier loans.
5.18      The Government contribution to capital-at-charge will include

be contributing US$110.0 million through the proposed credit. The balance will
be found from future bilateral loans and credits which have still to be
finally arranged and from the Govermnent's own resources. The proposed IDA
credit is, therefore, expected to provide 84% of the total foreign exchange
requirement during the disbursement period. The Government has been advised
that in future railway projects, the Association considers that a greater
proportion of the foreign exchange requirements for proprietary items and
spare parts should be met from other sources.
VI. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Draft Fifth Five-Year Plan 1974/75-1978/79
6.01      The position of IR in the context of the Indian economy and the
transport sector has been discussed in paras. 2.01 to 2.03 and the rela-
tionship between the 1975/76 budget, the Draft National Fifth Five-Year
Development Plan 1974/75-1978/79 and IR's Investment Program in paras. 4.01
to 4.06. The most likely development of railway traffic up to 1979/80 was
assessed on this basis and by taking into account past performance and
results of Bank economic work and sector studies on India (notably energy).
The traffic estimates, which are discussed in paras. 6.02 to 6.05, have
been used in: (a) formulating the railways physical and financial invest-
ment programs; (b) preparing the financial statements; and (c) the economic
evaluation.



- 22 -
B.  Traffic
6.02      Tables 15 and 16 show IR's past freight and passenger traffic
development, while Tables 17 and 18 show forecasts to 1979/80. Details
of freight traffic forecasts are provided in Annex 1. Passenger traffic
is expected to increase annually by 3.0% in terms of pass-km (Table 17).
This increase is lower than the annual growth rate of 4.9% experienced
during the Fourth Plan period 1969/70-1973/74.
6.03      The mission expects that IR freight traffic  n terms of revenue
earning ton-km will show an annual increase of 3.4% during the period
1972/73-1979/80 (Table 18). This growth rate is based on a commodity-
wise projection (Annex 1), that IR will carry about 230 million tons of
revenue-earning freight by the end of the Fifth Plan in 1978/79. In
addition, IR's own, non-revenue earning freight (railway coal and mate-
rials) is estimated to amount to about 20 million tons annually. This
forecast represents a substantial reduction of the Fifth Plan estimate of
280 million tons (255 million revenue-earning tons).
6.04      Rail transport of coal, which accounted for about 67.5 million
tons or for 33.5% of total traffic in 1972/73, is estimated to increase to
about 86 million tons by the end of the Fifth Plan period in 1978/79, rep-
resenting an annual increase of about 4%. With this growth rate, coal
would retain its one third share of total rail traffic, a ratio which has
remained unchanged since the early 1950's. Rail transport of the other six
main commodities -- raw materials and finished products of steel plants,
iron ore for export, cement, food grains, petroleum, oil and lubricants
and fertilizers --- which accounted for 72.3 million tons, or for 37.4% of
total traffic in 1972/73, is expected to increase to about 103 million tons
in 1978/79; this would imply an annual growth rate of about 6%. Their share
of total rail traffic would increase to 42.7%. The highest growth rate for
these commodities is estimated for fertilizer and iron ore for export,
transport of both is estimated to almost double over the period. The above
seven main bulk commodity groups which accounted for 76% of the total traffic
in 1972/73, would increase to about 80% by 1978/79.
C. Economic Evaluation
Improvements in Operational Efficiency and Investments
in Additional Capacity
6.05      The basic objectives of IR's investment program 1974/75-1978/79
are:
(a) to modernize the system in respect of its equipment
and practices to the maximum extent permitted by
the availability of funds, so as to improve the
efficiency of the network and to reduce costs; and



- 23 -
(b) to provide capacity for increased traffic during the
Fifth Plan period.
The first objective, improved operational-efficiency, has become increas-
ingly important. 1/ Its effect on IR's total investment requirements was
taken into account before estimating investments in additional capacity.
IR is able to handle about 220 million tons of freight without investments
in additional capacity by introducing appropriate improvements in operational
practices and by undertaking gradual modernization through necessary
replacements.
6.06 ..   The revised investment plan has been based on the above assess-
ment that IR would be able to carry 220 million tons of freight by 1978/79
without investment in additional capacity. Thus, about 35 million tons (55%)
of the estimated increase in freight traffic from 185 million tons in
1973/74 to 250 million tons in 1978/79 will be absorbed by better utilization
of existing capacity (including the effect of replacements), while the
remaining 30 million tons (45%) would be met through investments in addition-
al capacity.
Economic Justification
6.07      The underlying rationale of IR's investment program is that it
should meet the following requirements:
(a) it should represent the most economic transport
solution compared with alternative modes of
transport; and
(b) in addition, there should not exist any other
rail investment alternative (including the "do-
nothing" case), which would result in a higher
economic rate of return.
6.08      In respect to the first requirement, it is shown in Annex 13 and
Table 19, that IR's investment program during the project period will on
average result in an economic rate of return of 20%. It is also shown,
that the economic running cost by rail is Paise 4.3 (US0.6) per ton-km of
freight and Paise 2.6 (USd0.3) per pass-km, while the corresponding transport
costs for road transport are Paise 10.0 (USd1.3) and Paise 3.6 (USJO.5)
respectively. Although these estimates represent averages only, they clearly
demonstrate that, in general, the existing and projected freight traffic
volumes can be transported more economically by the railways. This is not
unexpected because more than 80% of the traffic is bulk transported over
1/   The action program and targets for improved operational performance
are discussed in Annex 7.



- 24 -
average distances exceeding 600 km. However, these results should be inter-
preted with caution; they are intended only to demonstrate, that the railway
is in general the most economic carrier of its present and projected future
traffic. This conclusion does not apply to any specific transport situation
and does not imply that any investment in the railways is economically jus-
tified. It is in fact demonstrated in Annex 13 and Table 19, that the mar-
ginal economic rate of return is decreasing with increased rail investment;
a further 20% increase in IR's investment program would most likely result
in a marginal rate of return for that investment of less than 15%.
6.09      The second requirement, the most economic rail investment alter-
native, has been analyzed on the basis of techno-economic studies undertaken
by IR for individual projects, which form IR's investment program. The
1975/76-1976/77 investment program includes 209 individual projects exceeding
Rs. 5.0 million in cost, in addition to investments in rolling stock. The
total cost of these projects is estimated at Rs. 12.1 billion (US$1,540
million) of which Rs. 3.7 billion (US$475 million) is budgeted for the two
project years. This represents about 50% of IR's total investment during
this period, while 40% of the total represents investments in rolling stock.
6.10      The Association has reviewed each of these projects on an in-
dividual basis. Because of the number of projects, this review was nec-
essarily limited only to the main features and, therefore, a sample of 29
major projects were reviewed in somewhat more detail. The total cost of
these projects is estimated at Rs. 3.5 billion (US$450 million), of which
Rs. 463 million (US$60 million) is budgeted for 1975/76-1976/77.  The budgeted
amount is small (less than 15%) in relation to the total project cost, be-
cause the sample included mainly projects which are to be started during the
project period with most of the outlay to be incurred during the subsequent
years.
6.11      The following conclusions emerged from the review of individual
railway projects. IR's project evaluation procedures are basically sound
(Annex 6) and considerable efforts are made to compare feasible rail invest-
ment alternatives with each other. There is, however, a need to apply
increasingly economic criteria in addition to financial and technical, which
traditionally have been extensively used by the railways. The cost estimates
are realistic and the returns on the proposed alternatives (based on discounted
cash value techniques) generally range from 10% to 25%, with an average
around 15%. There are however some projects, for which the return is less
than the 10% minimum required by the Railway Board. Most of these are for
new lines which have been included at the initiative of the Parliament and
State Governments to induce development of backward areas. A couple of
gauge conversion schemes are of similar nature. The actual economic return
may however be higher than estimated by IR, because it evaluation is limited
to savings in transport costs and does not normally include other developmental
benefits. In addition, many of these projects have been promoted to help
the poorest element of the population and to create employment opportunities.
The foreign exchange cost of these projects are negligible.



- 25 -
6.12      It is concluded that, taken as a whole, IR's investment program
responds relatively well to the needs of India's economy, particularly
after the reduction undertaken in the physical content of IR's investment
program for 1974/75-1978/79. The project provides for essential invest-
ments in renewals, cost saving works and limited expansion to carry forecast
traffic.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following princi-
pal matters:
(a)  the GOI to keep the Association informed of decisions taken
regarding the results of the 1973/74 transport sector review
and any other developments in the sector relating to
transport sector management and planning (para 2.07);
(b) appropriations to the Depreciation Reserve Fund shall be
not less than Rs 6,500 million in the aggregate for fiscal
years 1974/75 through 1978/79 and not less than Rs 1300
million for any of the fiscal years 1976/77 through 1978/79;
these provisions supercede agreements in section 4.02 of
the Twelfth Credit Agreement (para 5.11); and
(c) earnings are to be sufficient, for each fiscal year after
1975/76, to meet all operating expenses and dividend
payment on capital-at-charge, and in respect of the fiscal
year 1975/76, all operating expenses and 85% of the
dividend payable (paras. 5.12 and 5.15).
7.02      The proposed project provides a suitable basis for an IDA Credit
of US$110 million to the Government of India.

APPRAISAL OF A THIRTEENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Details of Traffic Forecasts
A.   Passenger Traffic
1.        The estimated development of IR's passenger traffic during the
period 1974/75-1979/80 is summarized in Table 14 with actuals for 1972/73-
1973/74. It is expected that passenger traffic will increase annually by
3.0% in terms of pass-km and by 2.3% in terms of number of passengers. The
average trip distance is estimated to increase slightly from 51 km in 1973/74
to about 53 km in 1979/80 because of estimated higher growth over long and
medium distances than in local traffic (para 4).
2.        The forecast was based on a separate examination of the two major
traffic categories -- "suburban" and "non-suburban" -- divided into various
classes of travel. "Suburban" traffic is defined to include passenger
traffic in and around the five major metropolitan areas, Bombay, Calcutta,
Madras, New Delhi and Sekunderabad; all other passenger traffic is defined
as "non-suburban".  During the 1960's, the "suburban" traffic increased at
a considerably higher rate than the "non-suburban" traffic, as indicated in
the following tabulation:
1960/61                1969/70        Growth, % p.a.
Pass.    Pass-km      Pass.     Pass-km  1960/61-1969/70
million  billion      million   billion  Pass.   Pass-km
Suburban                685       11.82       1,158     22.16    6.1       7.3
Non-suburban            909       65.85       1,180     91.22    2.0       3.8
Total            1,594      77.67       2,3$8    113.38    4.3        4.3
This growth was a result of the rapid expansion of the metropolitan areas,
while the main alternative mode, bus transport, was not developed at a suf-
ficiently rapid rate to handle a substantial part of this increase. As a
result, much uncontrolled ribbon development took place along the railway
lines in the outer fringes of the metropolitan areas.
3.        During the past five years there has, however, been a distinct
change to this growth pattern as indicated in the following tabulation:

1969/70            1973/74 (est.)    Growth, % p.a.
Pass.    Pass-km      Pass.      Pass-km  1969/70-1973/74
million  billion      million   billion  Pass.   Pass-km
Suburban               1,158      22.16       1,310     25.40    3.0      3.5
Non-suburban           1.180      91.22       1.353    110.26    3.5       4.9
Total             2,338    113.38       2,654    135.66    3.3        4.5
Non-suburban traffic shows higher growth rates, while for suburban traffic
they are considerably reduced. In addition, the growth rate in total number
of passengers is down, while the growth rate in pass-km has slightly accele-
rated. There are three main reasons for this development: (a) the growth
of the metropolitan areas has slowed down, particularly in Bombay and
Calcutta, mainly because of insufficient employment opportunities and be-
cause public facilities and services have not been developed at the same
rate as the growth in demand; (b) although still deficient, bus transport
has considerably expanded in recent years; and (c) rail transport capacity
has already for some time been fully utilized and the occupancy ratios have
reached hazardous levels; further expansion can only be provided with con-
siderable investments, while this traffic represents the single most
important element in the railways loss-making traffic. Consequently IR
has attempted gradually to reduce its share of the total suburban traffic.
4.        This development is expected to continue.  The highest growth rates
will be recorded over medium and longer distances, both for first class
ordinary and third (now second) class express train travel. In terms of
pass-km, the annual 1973/74-1978/79 growth rate for these travel categories
is expected to be 4.1%, while the growth rate for Second class ordinary
(mostly short distance and commuter traffic) is expected to be 2.8% p.a.
IR's tariff policy, which is becoming increasingly cost-based, is expected
to support this development.
B.   Freight Traffic
5.        The Inter-Ministerial Working Group, which was established in 1973
to work out railway freight traffic forecasts on basis of the Draft Fifth
Five-Year Plan 1974/75-1978/79, arrived initially at an estimate of 300 mil-
lion tons of originating revenue earning railway freight by 1978/79. This
estimate was subsequently reduced to 255 million tons (excluding 25 million
tons of IR's own, non-revenue earning traffic). IR's investment program
1974/75-1978/79 was based on these traffic targets. It is, however, now
apparent that the Draft Fifth Plan cannot be fully implemented - there is
already a substantial shortfall after the first year of the Plan and there
is little chance to catch up that much during the next few years because
of the Government's tight resource position and the considerable recent
price escalation. In addition, most of the major projects require implement-
ation periods considerably longer than the remaining Plan period. For these



ANNEX 1
Page 3
reasons, a re-examination of the railway freight traffic forecast was under-
taken by major commodities. The re-examination was based, to the extent
possible, on the Bank economic and sector work (notably energy) on India.
The revised forecast is summarized in Table 18. It is expected that the
originating revenue earning railway freight will amount to about 220 million
tons by 1978/79, 1/ a reduction of 35 million tons (14%) from the estimate
(itself revised from the original estimate of 300 million tons) used as basis
for IR's investment program. The revised forecast is expected to assume
annual growth of 3.9% in terms of revenue earning ton-kms, compared with
5.7% estimated in the original forecast. It is to be noted, that although
the forecast has been revised substantially downwards, there is no assurance
that it will be achieved, if adverse developments take place to the same
degree as during the past two years. The forecast by major commodities is
discussed below.
6.        Steel Plants.  Production of steel remained stagnant during the
Fourth Plan period 1969/70-1973/74. In fact, the volume of finished products
carried by the railways was about 15% less in 1973/74 than in the first year
of the Plan period. It is expected that 1974/75 will not be a significantly
better year. There are however possibilities for an increase in production
without any major, long maturing investments; the capacity of the already
commissioned steel plants exceeds 11 million tons in finished products. It
has been assumed that the very low capacity utilization ratios of 30-40% will
be increased to about 70% by the end of the Plan period in addition to com-
missioning Bokaro Steel Plant after considerable delays. This will make it
possible to reach a production of finished steel products of about 9 million
tons and generate a need for rail transport of some 55 million tons includ-
ing raw materials (incl. coal) for steel plants.
7.        Coal.  Except for coal for steel plants (which has been adjusted
to the estimated production of finished steel), the other major consumers
of coal are the thermal power plants. The mission expects that not all of
them will be commissioned within the time frame assumed in preparation of
the Fifth Plan. In addition, it is likely that some of the major thermal
power plants will be located close to the pitheads thus reducing the need
for transport of coal over longer distances. In line with the Bank Energy
Survey, it has been assumed that the total coal production may increase to
about 110 million tons by 1978/79, compared with the original estimate of
1/   A slightly higher forecast of 230 million tons has,however, been used
in preparation of the financial forecasts and the investment program
(Table 18), representing the Government's and IR's present assessment
of the most likely development. The mission believes that the higher
traffic target may be achieved, but, is of the view that the lower
estimate is in the present situation more realistic; any adjustment
should be based on the actual traffic development in 1975/76 and
1976/77.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
145-150 million tons. Of this total, some 85 million tons (incl. railways'
own coal) would be transported by rail, 5-6 million tons by coastal shipping,
12-15 million tons by trucks over short and medium distances, while the
remaining 5-10 million tons would be consumed at the mines or transported
over shorter distances by use of other means such as conveyor belts and
ropeways. IR's forecast for 1978/79 is at 90 million tons about 5 million
tons higher than the mission's estimate.
8.        Iron Ore for Export.  During recent years, about 10 million tons
of iron ore for export has been transported by rail, although a low of 8.5
million tons was recorded for 1973/74. The current :rear is not expected
to be better mainly because of the worldwide slump in demand, particularly
in Japan, where most of the exports is at present destined. The situation
is, however, expected to improve substantially during the later years of the
Plan period, partly because of the expected upturn of the market from
1975/76 onward and partly because of the agreement between India and Iran
to swap oil for iron ore. The rail transport volume is estimated at 15-16
million tons in 1978/79.
9.        Cement.  The demand for cement is expected to remain strong over
the whole Plan period. The Ministry of Industrial Development has furnished
detailed information regarding present and future capacities and locations
of cement plants. Although the original Plan target of 26.8 million tons
in rated capacity may have to be considered with skepticism, it is likely
that some 15 million tons will be transported by rail by the end of the
Plan period, implying an annual growth rate of 7.5%. The transport volume
has been some 10-11 million tons over the past five years.
10.       Foodgrains.  Rail transport of foodgrains has been around 14-15
million tons during recent years.  This volume is expected to increase
slightly to 16 million tons by the end of the Plan period. Although there
may be possibilities for greater self-sufficiency for the country as a
whole, regional imbalances will remain, requiring transport of foodgrain
over longer distances.
11.       Fertilizer.  A considerable increase in rail transport of fertil-
izer is expected, with an increase of 5.3 million tons in 1973/74 to about
9 million tons by 1978/79. This estimate is based on the expected production
of fertilizer plants already under construction, supplemented by Bank
estimates of the overall requirements of fertilizer in India. The forecast
has been checked with the Bank agricultural programs.
12.       Mineral Oil (POL Products).  Obviously the earlier estimates on
rail transport of POL products have been reduced (by about 1/3 from 19 million
to 13 million tons in 1978/79), but the fact is, that already before the oil
crisis India had restricted oil consumption severely and there remains
little to be done in further ructions. The assumptions on industrial and
agricultural revival will require a considerable increase in consumption of
POL products. This applies to all major, important industries: steel, coal,
power, cement, fertilizer and the transport industry itself. POL products



ANNEX I
Page 5
can be substituted by coal to certain extent only. Consequently it has
been assumed there will be a continuous increase in transport of POL products
at a annual rate of 5.9%, compared with the original Plan estimate of 9.5%.
13.       Other Goods.  This category represents a great variety of commod-
ities, ranging from bulk transport of products like salt, sand, stones,
marble to high value manufactured products. Rail transport of these commod-
ities has slowly decreased, partly because the growth of these industries
has been stagnant (or even being reduced because of the Government's policy
to curtail private consumption), partly because road transport captured
during 1960's that part of the traffic which it was able to carry more
economically. What remains is bulk transport over all distances (e.g. salt)
and transport of high valued goods over very long distances (e.g. apples
from Kashmir to Madras). The average transport distance for the group as
a whole is considerable, about 840 km; for high valued goods it exceeds
1,000 km. Less than 10% of railway freight represents high-value commodities
transported over short and medium distances. It may therefore be expected
that significant volumes would no more be diverted to road; the growth of
this traffic is more dependent on the expansion of these industries themselves.
In addition to coal, this is the only other major commodity group, where there
exist any significant difference between IR and the mission (Table 13). The
mission believes that rail transport of these commodities will remain stagnant
during the Fifth Plan period; IR has been more optimistic and assumes a re-
versal in the past trend. The expected growth rate at 1.9% p.a. is however
fairly modest.

APPRAISAL OF A THIRTEENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Indian Railways
A.   Organization, Management and Staff
1.        The IR network is owned and managed by the Central Government.  Its
operations are controlled and directed by a Board of five members headed by
a Chairman who is ex-officio a Principal Secretary to the Government of
India reporting to the Minister of Railways. One Board member, the Financial
Commissioner, has discretionary power to report directly to the Minister of
Finance on financial matters. The Board, therefore, performs the dual
functions of a Secretariat to the Ministry of Railways and of an executive
body responsible for railway operations.
2.        Control over railway finances and policy is exercised by Parliament
through discussions and voting on the railway budget and parliamentary
committees such as the Public Accounts Committee. Members of Parliament sit
on the MP's Consultative Committee of the Ministry of Railways to discuss
and be briefed on major aspects of the railways' working.
3.        The IR is the nation's largest undertaking with an investment of
Rs. 4,791 crores (US$6 billion equivalent) and total staff strength of 1.7
million. There are nine Zonal Railways, each of which is under the control
of a General Manager, and each zone is a large system on its own account.
IR also has three modern factories engaged in the manufacture of locomotives
and rolling stock.
4.        There are two recognized staff federations covering about 70% of
all staff. During the latter part of 1973 and the first half of 1974 there
was a succession of strikes and disputes, largely promoted by separatist
craft unions which are not recognized by the Board. One of the chief demands
was for a bonus payment, but the Bonus Review Committee has resolved that
employees of government undertakings are not to receive bonus payments.
While IR's Board has taken steps to strengthen its personnel branch and wel-
fare inspectorate and to improve promotion prospects it will be essential
for IR to be increasingly active in handling labor relations in order to
avoid future disputes and unrest.
5.        Wage costs have increased dramatically in recent years from Rs. 460
crores in 1970/71 to Rs. 647 crores in 1974/75. The percentage of total
staff costs to total operating costs which was 57% in 1973/74 is expected
to be about 63% in 1975/76. Labor productivity measured in traffic units



ANNEX 2
Page 2
per employee on open line has improved from 186,000 in 1970/71 to 202,000
in 1974/75.
6.        The quality of senior staff at Headquarters and in the Zonal
Railways is high and their professional knowledge of management techniques
and modern railway technology is excellent.
B.   Accounts, Costing and Audit
7.        Financial arrangements with the Government and audit procedures
have not changed since the appraisal report on the 12th railway credit was
prepared. Further details of these arrangements are shown in Annex 3.
Certain improvements to accounting procedures have been introduced including
a system of exchequer control (Annex 4) to control cash more stringently
against budget allowances. Furthermore, the three task forces established
by IR to examine (a) budgetary, accounting and management practices (Annex
5), (b) depreciation policy (Annex 6), and (c) restructuring of capital
have almost completed their work.
8.        The work of the task force on budgeting and accounting is a major
undertaking. Their first report recommends a functional approach to the
analysis of working expenses and presents a revised budgetary framework. It
expects to present very soon its second report - tackling the task of account-
ing classifications - with a target of introducing these revisions during
1976/77. IR depreciation policy is now under review following the report
of the Working Group. It is expected that IR will adopt a new approach to
depreciation allocations which could mean a revision of DRF provisions during
the 5th Plan period (1974/79).
9.        The work of the task forces and the improvements which have already
been made are to be welcomed. The considerable task of effecting reform is
being attacked, although it will inevitably take some time to implement.
It was confirmed during negotiations that the Railway Board will continue to
give its support to this program of reform.
10.       Traffic costing work continues its development satisfactorily.  A
detailed study is currently under way on the problem of allocation of in-
direct costs between freight and passenger traffic. Detailed cost figures
for selected (important) commodities are produced on an annual basis, relating
costs to tariffs and thereby demonstrating "profitability". Such data is
very useful to Zonal railways in the process of implementing commercial
marketing and tariff revision undertaken in 1974/75.
11.       The accounts of IR are audited by the Director of Railway Audit
(Comptroller and Auditor General department). The Auditor General supports
the views of the task forces on budgeting and accounting, understandably
favoring the process of simplication and clarification. Audit arrangements
are thorough and satisfactory.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
C.   Rates and Fares
12.       At the end of FY 1973/74, before the considerable rate increases
in 1974/75, the average rate charged was Paise 2.8 (US$0.35) per pass-km
and Paise 5.8 (US$0.75) per ton-km. These tariffs are low, and had increased
by only 85% over a 23-year period 1950/51-1973/74 implying an average annual
increase of 2.7%. In the same period, the average staff cost increased by
5.4% p.a., while the average annual increase in the wholesale price index
was about 4.3%. During 1973 the price index showed an increase of about 30%,
while the average receipts per traffic unit on the railways increased by
only 3.1%.
13.       This cost development, coupled with a reduction in railway freight
traffic in 1973/74 (Table 18), resulted in an unprecedented situation in
1974/75, during which the rates and fares had to be increased twice. As of
April 1, 1974, the rates and fares were increased on average by 11.1% per
pass-km and 12.4% per ton-km and in September 1974, further increases aver-
aging 18.6% for passenger traffic and 21.7% for freight were introduced.
The combined effect of these increases has been that the average fare per
pass-km has gone up by about 31%, while freight rates have increased by
about 36% per ton-km. These increases may appear high, but they do no more
than reflect the average inflation rate during the past two years. A
satisfactory feature was that the Government and IR took corrective actions
during the fiscal year 1974/75 instead of waiting for presentation of the
next year's budget.
14.       The rates and fares were increased on a selective, traffic costing
basis by traffic and distance categories. The Government has traditionally
applied a tariff policy which has tended to subsidize large segments of
freight (essential basic commodities) and passenger traffic (third class
travel), without taking due account of costs incurred. The latest rate and
fare increases represent a distinct step towards cost-based tariffs. Rail
freight of coal over longer distances has been in the past a prime example
of subsidized transport, which has annually resulted in considerable losses
to the railways. However, coal freight rates were increased both in April
and September and are now believed to be close to actual costs. The follow-
ing tabulation indicates the combined effect of the two rate increases by
distance categories:

1500       50.70          82.10        61.9        55.80    92.50    65.8
2000       61.60         100.70        63.5        67.80   113.60    67.7
The freight rates in most other categories have increased by about 23% for
distances up to 100 km, gradually increasing- to about 35% for distances ex-
ceeding 2000 km. As a result, the Government has in respect of freight
traffic abolished practically all subsidies. The most recent revisions were
made in presenting the 1975/76 budget and applied to foodstuffs and iron
and manganese ores. The tariffs for these commodities had not been revised
in 1974/75 and transport of foodgrains had traditionally represented a sub-
sidized item.
15.       A similar cost-based tariff policy has been applied towards passen-
ger fares. There have been substantial increases in all traffic categories,
but particularly in short distance third class (recently renamed second class)
travel which in the past resulted in considerable losses to the railways.
However, the rate increases applied primarily to other than commuter traffic,
which still remains heavily subsidized, although there is a clear desire
within the Government to reduce the losses on this traffic.
D.  Property
16.       General features.  IR operates over 60,000 route-km.  About 80% of
total railway traffic in terms of gross ton-km is carried on the 30,000 km
of broad gauge (BG). The BG kilometrage is comparable to the networks of
German Federal Railway (29,000 km) and French National Railways (35,000 km)
but carries approximately twice the traffic 1/ with about the same number of
locomotives. About 39% of BG lines are double-tracked, thereby producing
good line capacity. On BG lines, diesel and electric traction hauls 65% of
total gross ton-km with the remaining 35% being hauled by steam traction.
About 4,025 route-km, or only about 13% of the BG system, are electrified,
which appears low in view of the traffic densities. Details of route-km by
gauge, double-tracked route-km, electrified route-km and track-km are given
in Table 2.
1/   In terms of traffic units (passenger-km plus net ton-km).



ANNEX 2
Page 5
17.       Tracks.  The total running track length of BG lines is about 43,000
km, of which passenger express train routes, selected high traffic density
routes and suburban sections constitute about 24,000 km, (about 10,000 route-
km) on which the average traffic density exceeds 20 million gross ton-km per
year per route-km. Primary track renewal is carried out on a programmed basis
on these line sections. In addition to complete track revenewal (CTR) of
about 400 km of track, rail renewal of another 400 km is executed annually.
In rail terms, this indicates a 30-year service cycle, which is acceptable
taking into account relatively easy gradients and gently curves of tracks.
A secondary track renewal program based on a 50-year cycle, is applied on
the remaining 19,000 km and other siding tracks. Thia is also acceptable.
Track maintenance organization and procedures are satisfactory; track inspec-
tion is carried out three times a year by using a track recording car; time
intervals necessary for track maintenance works are incorporated in advance
in the master diagram for train movements. Long welded rails with elastic
fastenings are already in common use, but the definitive design of concrete
sleepers was established only recently; about 90 km of track is now laid with
these sleepers. Related to this, suitable track maintenance and renewal
equipment is gradually being introduced.
18.       Bridges.  There are still 116 bridges on BG lines with speed
restrictions because of weaknesses in either superstructure or substructure;
these are being gradually improved. Each zonal railway has its own bridge
maintenance organization in addition to its track maintenance organization.
All bridges are subject to a once-a-year inspection, which is satisfactory.
19.       Locomotives.  At the end of 1973/74, on BG lines, there were
5,302 steam locomotives, 908 diesel electric mainline locomotives, 216
diesel hydraulic shunters and 649 electric locomotives. About 15% of the
total steam locomotive fleet was over 40 years in age but, the majority
is relatively new, 37% of the total fleet being less than 17 years old.
Traction policy relating to conversion from steam to diesel and electric
traction was re-examined by IR after the energy crisis. The main conclu-
sions were:
(a) There is no justification for resuming the
manufacture of BG steam locomotives, but it would
be worthwhile to slow down the scrapping of old
steam locomotives;
(b) Electrification becomes more economical than
dieselization at traffic densities exceeding 14
million compared with the 16 million gross ton-km
per route-km estimated before the energy crisis;
and
(c)  The original target of electrifying 1,800 route-km
during IR's Investment Program 1974/75-1978/79 is
likely to be to some extent reduced because of physical
and financial constraints.



ANNEX 2

To obtain the maximum benefit from further electrification, it is however
essential to make further efforts to reduce electric locomotives maintenance
costs. Efforts should also be made to solve the remaining difficulties
experienced in standardization of AC (alternating current) electric loco-
motives. On the other hand, past problems with traction motors have now
been solved.
20.       Passenger vehicles.  The present BG passenger vehicles include
about 19,000 passenger coaches, 1,700 electric multiple units (EMU's) and
26 diesel railcars. About 8% of the passenger coaches are over 40 years
of age. The occupancy ratio remains high (70% and 95% passengers per
passenger coach and EMU car, respectively). IR passenger-carrying capacity
has reached saturation levels on major trunk routes and in and around
urban areas; improvements to passenger vehicles are generally needed.
21.       Freight wagons.  The present fleet of BG freight wagons consists
of about 290,000 units, the equivalent of 385,500 four-wheelers.  The
fleet is relatively new, only 4% being over 40 years old.  Almost all iron
ore traffic and part of the coal traffic is hauled by unit trains with new-
type bogie wagons, but most of the coal is still carried by block trains
of conventional four-wheeler wagons. IR's motive power and rolling stock
position by gauge at the end of 1973/74 is given in Table 3.
22.       Scrapping policy and procedures.  IR bases its scrapping of loco-
motives and rolling stock on the actual condition of the stock. However,
in the case of wagons, IR allows their scrapping to be postponed for
several months depending on fluctuations in traffic demand. The scrapping
decision is based on a comparative technical and financial study with
and without scrapping. The Railway Board has delegated to the Director
of the Mechanical Engineering Department of each zonal railway responsi-
bility for decisions regarding locomotives and passenger vehicles, while
the Deputy Director of the same Department has similar responsibility for
wagons.
23.       Workshop and running shed operations.  IR has 41 workshops (six
major, 20 medium and 15 minor) in addition to running sheds. Their organi-
zation and maintenance operations are generally satisfactory. However,
some imported spare parts are not readily available in workshops and run-
ning sheds, and this prologns days in shop for the stock but also contri-
butes to some deterioration in the availability of, particularly, diesel
locomotives. Because of this, a unit exchange policy is gradually being
introduced; it involves concentration of components and parts rebuilding
to specially designated workshops.



ANNEX 2
Page 7
E.   Manufacturing Units
24.       IR manufactures all its diesel and electric locomotives, most
of its passenger vehicles, and a small proportion of its wagons, most of
which are manufactured by private wagon builders. Locomotives production
still requires imports of essential materials and components, but steady
if somewhat slow progress is being made toward complete indigeneous produc-
tion. The workshops are efficient and the products -- particularly mainline
diesel locomotives -- have proven to be reliable in service and their cost
less than the c.i.f. cost of imported locomotives and rolling stock. A
production program of locomotives and rolling stock under IR's Investment
Program 1974/75-1978/79 is given in Table 4.
25.       The Diesel Locomotive Works (DLW) at Varanasi has a production
capacity of 150 diesel electric locomotives a year. However, both in
1973/74 and 1974/75 only 95 locomotives were produced, mainly due to lower
than anticipated traffic, and difficult industrial relations and power cuts.
There should be no difficulty in reaching the production targets for 1975/76
(67) and 1976/77 (120), while targets for 1977/78 (140) and 1978/79 (148)
can be achieved by taking full advantage of the installed capacity.
26.       The Chittaranjan Locomotive Works has a production capacity of
130 locomotives (80 electric and 50 diesel hydraulic) a year. In 1973/74,
however, they produced 96 locomotives, and in 1974/75 only 69, partly due
to traction motor deficiencies and partly to labor unrest. The production
targets, 73 for 1975/76 and 90 for 1976/77 and 1977/78 can be achieved, and
the target for the last year 1978/79 of 98 is still within the production
capacity of the Works.
27.       The Integral Coach Factory in Madras has a production capacity of
750 passenger vehicles a year. In 1973/74 and 1974/75, it produced at full
capacity, being affected far less by power cuts and labor disturbances than
other plants. There should be no major problem in achieving the projected
passenger vehicle production targets during the current Investment Program.
F.   Operating Performance
28.       IR's operating performance for the period 1969/70-1974/75 (April-
December) is shown in Table 5 for BG and MG lines. Performance is general-
ly satisfactory except for wagon turnround which should be improved 1/.
Average gross freight trailing load averaging about 1,400 tons is remarkable
and well exceeds that of the German Federal Railway and French National
Railways. Net ton-km per year per ton-of wagon capacity (14,000 ton-km) is
good and about double that of the German Federal Railway and French National
Railways. Wagon turnround, 15 days in 1973/74, is high and was largely a
result of low traffic volume. The wagon turnround has however been improving
(13.8 days in December 1974) with increased traffic. To further improve
1/ Comparison with two European railways of similar size is made in Table 6.



ANNEX 2
Page 8
wagon turnround times, IR worked out, on request of the Association, an Ac-
tion Plan for targets to be achieved for the two years 1975/76 and 1976/77
(Annex 7). The Association will be kept informed of the results of actual
performance and corrective measures to be taken, on a biannual basis
(April/May and October/November) during the Project period. This should be
discussed during negotiations.
G.   Performance Under Previous Credits
29.       Covenants entered into under Credit 448-IN included an earnings
covenant (Section 4.02) and a requirement to prepare and keep up to date a
Corporate Plan. The earnings covenant required IR to earn sufficient reve-
nue to meet all operating expenses and the dividend payable to the Govern-
ment but because of an exceptionally heavy increase in personnel costs in
1973 resulting from a Pay Commission award, requirements of the earnings
covenant for 1973/74 were waived at the time of negotiating the Twelfth
Credit.
30.       In 1973/74, increased personnel costs (applied with retroactive
effect) amounted to about Rs. 1,000 million annually and this led to the
Association waiving the requirements of the earnings covenant under Credit
280-IN. Furthermore, in negotiating Credit 448-IN it was agreed that
earnings should be sufficient in 1974/75 and 1976/77 to meet only 70% and
85% respectively of the dividend payments due in those years. On the
basis of revised estimates for 1974/75 net revenue from operations is
expected to be Rs. 885 million. However, expenditure for 1974/75 included
a "throw-forward" of personnel costs from 1973/74. After an adjustment for
this item the true earnings from operations in 1974/75 would amount to
Rs. 1305 million or 69% of the dividend payment or very nearly the 70% re-
quired by the covenant. This point is worthy of note since at the Board
presentation of the Twelth Credit, a Board member expressed some skepticism
that the terms of the covenant would be fulfilled and the President under-
took to report to the Board in three years time (i.e. December 1976) on
IR's performance.
31.       In the 12th credit (448-IN) agreement was reached to appropriate
Rs. 1200 million and Rs. 1250 million to DRF for the years 1974/75 and
1975/76 respectively. The revised estimate for 1974/75 and the budget
estimate for 1975/76, make provision for only Rs 1150 million in each year.
However, the Railway Board has now presented an official letter to the
Association explaining that while the Railway Board's own proposals to the
Convention Committee for DRF allocations in the Fifth Plan would have been
fully consistent with the covenant, the Committee took an interim decision
pending the report of the Working Party on Depreciation. (See further
discussion at para. 5.14). During negotiations the Association expressed
concern that the charges for depreciation were not in accordance with the
amounts stipulated in the Twelfth Credit but accepted the reasons leading
to the changed decisions. The new Credit (para 5.11) provides that a global
sum of Rs 6,500 million shall be appropriate to DRF during the Fifth Plan



ANNEX 2
Page 9
and that not less than Rs 1300 million shall be changed in each of the years
1976/77 through 1978/79; no specific minima were stipulated for the years
1974/75 and 1975/76 since the amounts to be charged are already known.
32.       The replacement policy of IR has not been curtailed because of
these interim measures and the balance held in the DRF itself has been
maintained. It is also relevant to mention that an additional Rs 27 million
is allocated or appropriated to DRF from the three manufacturing units
(Chittaranjan Locomotive Works, Integral Coach Factory and Diesel Locomotive
Works). It would not be unreasonable to regard this as an additional
allocation to DRF in interpreting the definition of DRF appropriation in
Section 4.02(b) (ii) of credit agreement 448-IN.
33.       An initial version of IR's Corporate Plan was completed in
January 1974 and work is now proceeding on the substantive version of the
Plan which should be ready by June 1976. Corporate Planning cells have
been established in each Zonal Railway and their work is being coordinated
from the Board's own Corporate Planning Cell which has been assisted by
the Association's consultant, Mr. K. V. Smith (TRANSMARK, U.K.). During
negotiations the Indian delegation expressed their desire that the planning
work should continue according to the agreed timetable. They also suggested
that another visit by Mr. K.V. Smith in about September/October 1975 would
be welcomed.
34.       The Twelfth Railway Credit 448-IN helped to finance a project
which was defined as a fifteen-month period (from January 1974 through
March 1975) of IR's on-going investment program.  The total cost of the
proposed investments was estimated at the time of appraisal at Rs. 4,874
million, but actual expenditures in the period are likely to be Rs. 4,147
million. This was a result of postponing investment because of lower
traffic levels and because of interruptions to work through labor dis-
putes. Consequently, the Association's Credit 448-IN which was expected
to contribute to IR's foreign exchange expenditures in a fifteen-month
period to March 1975 will now cover expenditures to July 1975. Expenditure
during this period will amount to about Rs. 5208 million but if deflated to
take account of inflation the expenditure in terms of 1972/73 Rupees would
amount to Rs. 4,005 million or 82% of the original estimate. Physical out-
puts of locomotives and rolling stock were consistent with the reduced level
of spending but expenditure on electrification and other works exceeded the
original estimates largely because of an above average rate of inflation in
the price of many of the items of equipment used in these works.
H.   Railway Planning
35.       Railway planning in India is undertaken on two levels.  On the
national level, it is geared to the annual and five-year planning system
adopted by the Government for the overall development of the economy.
The purpose of this planning exercise is to establish the rail transport
requirements during five-year plan periods by converting the plan targets



ANNEX 2
Page 10
into physical input and output volumes. These volumes are established
by the Planning Commission and the various Ministries concerned and are
reappraised by the Government from time to time.
36.       The planning, evaluation and project sanctioning system applied
by IR is defined in the various railway codes and policy directives and
summarized in Annex 8. The railway's internal planning is mainly under-
taken for preparation of annual investment and work program. According
to this system, no project costing more than Rs. 0.5 million (US$65,000
equivalent) can be sanction by the Railway Board and included in the
annual program without a project study based on a comprehensive techno-
economic survey. The evaluation criteria have in most cases been tech-
nical and financial, while economic considerations have been taken into
account only in the most significant new works (gauge conversion and
electrification shcemes, new lines, etc.). However, increased emphasis
is being given to development of methodology, data base and evaluation
of alternatives. Further improvements should gradually take place with
development of the Corporate Planning work and increased attention given
to the Economic Unit in the Railway Board.
37.       For these reasons, and recognizing the limited guidance the
planning on the national level can give to long-term railway planning,
it was agreed during negotiations for the Eleventh Railway Project (Credit
280-IN) in 1971 that specific long-term objectives were needed, so that a
clear framework would exist as a basis for five-year planning and that IR
would set up an organization of qualified staff to prepare a 15-year Corporate
Plan for IR on the basis of these objectives. The initial version of the
Corporate Plan on the IR Board level was prepared by November 1973.
38.       Corporate planning cells have been established in all Zonal
Railways, and these are each preparing their own draft plans on the basis
of the initial version, under the general guidance of the Board. In
preparing the intial versions, these planning cells are not bound to
undertake long-term planning on the basis of overall targets set on the
national level, but are encouraged to make their own judgments of the
regional and local needs and to independently find the most feasible
solutions. Starting in July 1975, the initial versions will be reviewed
and coordinated with each other by the Planning Department in the IR
Board. According to a timetable established by IR, the Corporate Plans
will be completed by June 1976. This planning exercise is proceeding
well.
39.       The position of the Economic Unit was discussed during the ap-
praisal. A general agreement was reached that the scope of work of the
Unit should be developed on the following lines: (a) it should increasingly
become a supervising unit in line with other departments in the Railway
Board; (b) it should be closely associated with the corporate planning
work (which so far has been directed by the Planning Department alone);
(c) it should become involved with project preparation work at its early



ANNEX 2
Page I 1
stages on the Zonal Railway level; and (d) in line with these changes it
should be authorized to issue guidelines and supervise technoeconomic
project feasibility studies to ensure that due account is taken of economic
considerations. IR agreed during negotiations to look into the practical
arrangements to achieve these objectives.

Financial Arrangements between Indian Railways and the Government
1.        The accounts of IR are those of a Government department and are
designed to show the origin and use of public funds. The Government author-
izes all the capital and operating funds required by IR in accordance with
budgets approved by Parliament and acts as IR's treasurer. Bank loans and
IDA credits are channeled through the Government to IR and, insofar as they
relate to additions, they appear in IR's accounts as interest-bearing
permanent capital known as capital-at-charge and become part of the Govern-
ment's investment. The portion of foreign loans obtained to finance replace-
ments is reimbursed in local currency to the Government by IR as expenditures
are incurred.
2.        Capital expenditures on fixed assets are financed as follows:
Additions are financed entirely by an increase in the Government's capital-
at-charge provided they can be shown to produce a financial return of not
less than 10%. Additions which do not meet this requirement, mainly new
minor works, are financed from IR's own resources and are either charged to
revenue if less than Rs 300,000 or are met from net earnings channeled through
the Development Fund which also finances user amenities and welfare works.
Replacements are financed from IR's own resources through the Depreciation
Reserve Fund 1/ at full replacement cost; the amounts set aside to this fund
as a charge to revenue are determined quinquennially (subject to annual
review) on the basis of an estimate of replacement costs during the follow-
ing five years. Although in the past 20 years the Government has collected
some Rs 19 billion in dividends from IR, the additional capital provided by
the Government to IR in the same period amounts to about Rs 29 billion.
This contribution of the Government includes the proceeds of substantial
foreign exchange loans and credits (including Bank and IDA). In financing
the entire cost of replacements, IR makes a substantial contribution to
total expenditure on capital account, having provided during the past five
years, 1970/71-1974/75, some Rs 6.5 billion 2/ from its own resources,
equivalent to 42% of total capital expenditure.
1/   The Depreciation Reserve Fund (DRF) functions as a reserve for renewals
of capital assets. Appropriations are made annually to the Fund, the
corresponding charge being described as Appropriation to Depreciation
Reserve Fund under the heading of Operating Expenses. The term
"depreciation" should be construed accordingly and operating ratios
are calculated after taking this appropriation into account.
2/   Including expenditure financed by temporary loans from the Government
which at March 31, 1974 amounted to Rs 1032 million inclusive of
interest. These loans are intended to be repaid during succeeding years
from revenue surpluses.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
3.        The financial arrangements between the Government and the Railways
as approved by Parliament are fixed by a Convention Committee which is con-
stituted at five-year intervals. Under these arrangements, dividend on
capital-at-charge 1/ has been increased several times, and with effect from
April 1, 1966, has been fixed at 5.5% on capital provided to March 31, 1964,
and 6.0% on capital provided thereafter. (For the three years 1963/64 to
1965/66, the corresponding rates were 4.5% and 5.75% respectively). These
dividends are payable to the Government even though in a given year the
net earnings are insufficient to cover the dividend. During the years
1966/67-1970/71 and again in 1973/74 IR's net revenue was insufficient to
meet the full dividend payment as well as expenditure chargeable to the
Development Fund; consequently, after using up its own accumulated reserves,
IR has had to obtain temporary loans from the Government which at March 31,
1974, amounted to Rs 2,080 millions including accrued interest. By March 31,
1975, this figure is expected to increase to Rs 3,640 million.
4.        IR's accounts are audited by the Director of Railway Audit
(Comptroller and Auditor General's Department). The emphasis of this audit
is on ensuring that funds have been applied in accordance with budgetary
allocations approved annually by Parliament. In each railway zone and manu-
facturing unit there is a Chief Auditor. These officers are all qualified
(Indian Audit and Accounts Service). In addition, each railway division has
an Audit Officer who reports to his Chief Auditor who in turn reports to the
Director of Railway Audit. The observations and reports of the Chief
Auditors form the basis of an annual report prepared by the Director of
Railway Audit drawing attention to a wide variety of matters which are re-
viewed and investigated by the Public Accounts Co mittee which, in turn,
publishes a report of its discussions, recommendations, and findings. The
detailed auditor's Report and the proceedings of the Public Accounts Com-
mittee are exhaustive and satisfactory.
5.        Internal audit is provided for through accounts inspection wings
for each railway zone and division reporting to the appropriate general
manager. Railway Board HQ also has an audit inspection staff reporting to
the Director of Accounts and to the Financial Commissioner. Traveling
inspectors of accounts in each zone perform station audit and stores verif-
ication work. These arrangements are satisfactory.

more in the nature of fixed interest payments on capital provided by
the Government.

Exchequer Control
Exchequer control, introduced in September 1973, is designed to
control cash outflow against monthly budget allowances. The control is
exercised at headquarters by IR central financial management. A zonal rail-
way/department budget is broken down into monthly expenditure estimates and
actual disbursements recorded.
The basic principle is that, if a budget for the period/year is
exhausted, further expenditure is not permitted unless authorization is
given by Delhi.
Although the control is inevitably restricted to cash expenses
(meaning that it cannot cover all IR expenditures) and does not cover earn-
ings (and is therefore not a full cash budget/control process), it is a
significant measure introduced primarily because of a shortage of Government
resources and the need to control cash expenditure. Part at least of the
economies achieved in 1973-74, may be attributed to its introduction. It is
not to be a permanent feature of IR financial management.

Summary of the First Report of the Task Force on Budgetary, Accounting
& Management Practices; Restructuring Demands for Grants and Budgetary
Documents
1.        The task force recommends adoption of a function-oriented rather
than output-oriented system to analyze the working expenses of the Railways.
2.        A revised list of Demands for all railway expenditure is proposed,
covering zonal operating costs and central expenditure. The proposals are
to rationalize the existing demands by splitting the large and grouping the
small.
3.        A single Demand for all works expenditure is proposed, regardless
of source of financing. It is proposed that such a classification be used to
make the works budget performance-oriented and to collate expenditure under
departmental responsibility.
4.        The task force proposes a revision of accounting classifications
to fulfill management reporting and information requirements, budgetary and
costing needs. The second report of the task force unit, given approval of
the principles outlined in this first report, compiles a completely new
classification code in detail.
5.        The introduction of performance budgeting is recommended, sup-
ported by the restructured Demands and accounting classification.
6.        The task force identifies the need for training in the new system
and the possible introduction of the revised system by April 1976 - i.e.,
for the FY1976-77.

INDIA
APPRAISAL OF A THIRTEENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations Contained
in The Working Party Report on Depreciation Policy
1.        The current Replacement Cost approach should be followed in the
Railways for the purpose of charging depreciation considering the permanent
character of Railways and their crucial role in providing infra-structure for
economic development. Accordingly, the estimated inflationary and improve-
ment element will form part of this Replacement Cost.
2.        There is no need to create a separate Renewal Reserve Fund in view
of (1) above.
3.        In the context of above, there is no fundamental necessity to
change the present system of working out the provision DRF based on current
Replacement needs.
4.        However, since the Convention Committee have desired that a
separate system should be outlined, the following alternatives were con-
sidered:
System I -    Calculation of depreciation provision based on asset
registers for each individual asset. Another refine-
ment of the same system would be the adoption of
Group Plan System of working out depreciation for a
given recognized group of assets.
System II -    Calculation of depreciation provision based on the
already available data on wasting railway assets con-
tained in the Block Account i.e. working out separa-
tely the provision on account of the three elements
viz. the provision based on original cost of the
assets, the provision on account of inflation, and
the provision on account of the improvement element.
The sum total of these three provisions would auto-
matically meet the requirements of current replacement
cost approach.
System III -   Calculation of depreciation based on available data
of Railway's wasting assets in terms of physical units
under clearly assignable asset groups and estimating
their current replacement cost by evaluating them and
thus arriving at the provisions for Depreciation Reserve
Fund.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
5.        In view of the cumbersomeness of the procedure, as well as
substantial recurring expenditure of about Rs 60 lakhs per annum involved,
the Working Group do not recommend the adoption of System I.
RECOMMENDATIONS
(i)  The Working Group recommends a provision of Rs 660 to 750
crores for the Fifth Plan based on Systems II and III.
(ii)  The Working Group recommends the review of the quantum of
provision during the middle of the Fifth Plan in case the
rate of inflation warrants it but in any case after every
five years.
(iii)  The Railway system is an important infra-structure
for the economy. It is extensive in its area of operations
with a route kilometrage of about 60,000 and is complex in
its variety of operations. Hence, in the interests of
prudent financial management, if the financial situation
permits, the Working Group recommends the maintenance of
at least 5% of the block value of wasting assets as the
balance in the Depreciation Reserve Fund to meet the unfor-
seen exigencies which may be caused by the unpredictable
inflationary situation as also due to the rapid strides in
the field of technological advancement.
6.        The Working Group accordingly recommend the adoption of either
System II or System III, if at all it is considered necessary to change
the existing procedure.
7.        The depreciation on assets created betweenl969-70 and 1973-74,
works to Rs 99 crores for the 4th Plan and Rs 205 crores for the 5th Plan,
based on current replacement cost approach and applying the factors of
inflationary and improvement elements as worked out under System I.
8.        The total provision to the Depreciation Reserve Fund during the
Fifth Plan under the three systems would be as follows:
System I        -    Rs 730 crores.
System II      -    Rs 658 crores.
System III      -    Rs 750 crores.
It is felt that adoption of either of the two systems recommended
by the Working Group will ensure that there is no serious under provisioning
or over provisioning.



ANNEX 6
Page 3
9.        Considering the importance of the Railway of the Railway system as
an inherent part of the infra structure of the economy as also due to its
vast area, volume and complexity of operations, in the interests of prudent
financial management, if the financial situation permits, the Working Group
recommend maintenance of at least 5% of the block value of wasting assets
as the balance in the Depreciation Reserve Fund to meet the unforeseen
exigencies which may be caused by the unpredictable inflationary situation
as also due to the rapid strides in the field of technological advancement.
10.       The summary of recommendations pertaining to determination of the

APPRAISAL OF A THIRTEENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
IR Action Plan for Improving Wagon Turnround
1.        IR's Investment Program 1974/75-1978/79 assumes the wagon turnround
in the last year 1978/79 to be improved to 12.1 days on BG and 9.6 days on
MG. The actual turnround during 1972/73 when the Program was prepared was
13.5 days on BG and 10.8 days on MG. In 1973/74, the turnround had deterio-
rated to 15.0 days on BG and 12.5 days on MG. However, 1973/74 was a
completely abnormal year for IR as operations during that year remained
continuously disrupted due to frequent strikes, go-slow tactics, work-to-
rule agitations, etc., by different categories of railwaymen. A fair com-
parison can, therefore, be made with the performance in 1972/73 when IR
operations were comparatively more stable, even though a number of extraneous
factors disturbed normal flow of movement in that year too.
2.        The following are the main considerations on which IR's assumptions
relating to improvements in wagon turnround by the end of the Program have
been based.
(i) Provision of additional facilities on collieries to
facilitate loading of coal in block rakes;
(ii) Mechanization of handling arrangement both of the
loading end as well as unloading ends in respect of
coal traffic for bulk consumers;
(iii) Setting up of coal dumps at focal points in all States
to which coal could be moved in train loads and from
where further distribution to consumers could be
arranged by road transport;
(iv) More block rake movements in commodities like fertilizers,
POL, etc., the consumers resorting to road bridging at
destination in the case of commodities like fertilizers to
carry this product from the central focal receiving and
warehousing points to consumers in the zone served by such
central points;
(v) Uniform loading and unloading on all days of the week by
major rail users like collieries, power houses, steel
plants, etc;



ANNEX 7
Page 2
(vi)  Provision of diesel shunters, modern lighting equipment
and intra-yard communications facilities to tone up working
of yards;
(vii) Provision of adequate storage capacity for coal and other
commodities with the users to avoid detention to wagons;
(viii) Mechanization of principal IR marshalling yards and re-
modelling of existing yards to enable quicker handling
of wagons and increased long distance marshalling to
bypass more intermediate yards; and
(ix) Expansion of dieselization/electrification program which
would, inter alia, result in speeding up of movement.
3.        Within the framework of the above mentioned strategies, the follow-
action has been initiated/proposed by IR/rail users:
Coal Traffic
3.1.1     To assess the quantum and nature of the infrastructure facilities
required to handle the vastly increased quantum of coal traffic projected
during the Program, IR has set up Study Teams, one each for Bengal-Bihar
Coalfields and Outlying Coalfields. These Study Teams studied the movement
pattern of coal traffic in relation to the production plans for the same in
various coal fields and made recommendations for development of adequate
capacities within the colliery sidings, the serving depot yards, on the
sections and at the terminals. One of the important recommendations of the
Study Teams related to facilities for increased loading of coal traffic.
The scheme envisages a substantial reduction in the number of coal loading
points so that at these points adequate siding lengths could be provided to
enable loading of coal being arranged in train loads. By this process the
extra detention caused on account of coal loading being undertaken at several
points and in piecemeal fashion would be avoided. Detailed plans in this
behalf have been formulated and for implementation of the same, necessary
coordination is being maintained with the Ministry of Energy and with the
coal-producing organizations like Coal Mines Authority of India Ltd. and
Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. Some progress has already been achieved in this
regard and it is proposed to follow it up further in coming years.
3.1.2     For all the major bulk consumers of coal like power houses, steel
plants, heavy industries etc., it is being stipulated by IR that handling of
coal will have to be arranged mechanically in their sidings. Installation of
tipplers is accordingly being programmed by these consumers in their plans.
For example, the Obra Thermal Power Plant, which is one of the largest
thermal units in India and which has facilities for mechanical handling of
coal, is further augmenting these facilities to enable handling of increased
requirements of coal on account of plans for increased generation of



ANNEX 7
Page 3
electricity. The expansion plans of the Bhilai Steel Plant as well as
Bokaro Steel Plant envisage provision of facilities for quick release of
wagons loaded with coal. An additional tippler is also under construction
in the Durgapur Steel Plant.
3.1.3     In coordination with the Ministry of Energy and the coal-producing
organizations, specific linkages are being finalized for the movement of:
(a) Raw coal from individual collieries to individual washeries;
(b) Washed coal from individual washeries to individual steel
plants;
(c) Coal from individual collieries to individual power houses;
and
(d)  Coal from individual collieries to bulk consumers like
cement plants, fertilizer plants, etc.
With the determination of these firm linkages, movement will be rationalized
as to permit block rake loading which would improve wagon turnround.
Finished Products from Steel Plants
3.2       Until recently, a substantial quantum of finished products of the
steel plants used to move in piecemeal car-loads to a number of destinations.
With the cooperation of the Ministry of Steel and the Steel Authority of
India, it has lately been possible to arrange more movement of finished
products in block rakes. To enable expeditious handling of block rakes at
the destination end, the Steel Authority of India has set up a number of
steel stock-yards at principal consuming centers in India such as Delhi,
Bombay, Calcutta, Ahmedabad, Madras, Bangalore, Jullundur, Allahabad, etc.
In the coming years, the Steel Authority of India has further plans to set
up more such stock-yards at Secunderabad, Vishakhapatnam, Faridabad,
Ghaziabad, etc. The setting up of these steel stock-yards has resulted in
a very noticeable improvement in the pattern of movement of steel products
traffic. Steel Authority of India has also selected certain points, limited
in number, in consultation with IR, to which block rakes with steel products
will move and consumers will be required to take their steel either at these
points or from the stock-yards. This will greatly reduce piecemeal movement
of steel products. As a considerable quantum of this traffic now moves in
block rates, the transit time of the wagons containing this traffic has shown
a welcome decline. As more traffic is handled in block rakes, expeditious
return of the special wagons used for the purpose is also being achieved.



ANNEX 7
Page 4
Raw Materials to Steel Plants
3.3       With a view to arranging systematic movement of raw materials to
steel plants, IR has finalized, with the help of the Ministry of Steel and
the Steel Authority of India, rational linkages for the year 1975/76.
Similar linkages for the remaining years of IR's Investment Program are in
process of finalization. These linkages are normally from the nearest
sources of supply of raw materials. Handling arrangements for these raw
materials both at the loading end as well as in the steel plants are also
being improved to reduce detention to wagons. For instance, mechanical
loading arrangements are being provided at Bhawnathpur on the Eastern Rail-
way for loading limestone to Bokaro and Durgapur Steel Plants. Round-the-
clock working on all days of the week is also being introduced at all major
loading points.
Iron Ore for Export
3.4       For handling iron ore traffic for export, tipplers are already
available at the Vishakhapatnam port. Installation of tipplers is now in
progress at Madras and Haldia ports and the same are also planned for
Paradip. With the commissioning of the Outer Harbor project at Madras,
where tipplers will be installed in September 1975, improved handling
arrangements are being provided to handle an increased quantum of iron ore
traffic for export. Mechanical loading arrangements at certain loading
points handling heavy traffic in iron ore such as Kirandul, Goa, Bolani,
Kiriburu, and Joda are also being extended. High capacity gondola-type
wagons (BOY) are increasingly being introduced to enable increased traffic
being expeditiously handled. Electrification of the Bailadila iron ore
line is also in progress.
Foodgrains
3.5       More foodgrains traffic, both indigenous as well as imported, is
being moved in block rakes. Every month during the season, IR chalks out
a rake-loading program for foodgrains in consultation with the Food Corpora-
tion of India and other procurement agencies. Loading is then arranged in
train-loads for the farthest destinations. Short-lead movements which are
more suitable for road transport are being gradually shed.
Fertilizers
3.6       As considerable quantities of fertilizers traffic is being
imported, arrangements are currently being made by the Ministry of Agri-
culture to install mechanical unloading, bagging and loading plants at the



ANNEX 7
Page 5
ports such as Bombay and Kandla. With the setting up of these facilities,
it is planned to move more traffic in fertilizers in train-loads all the
way from Bombay/Kandla to distant areas in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh,
etc. The Ministry of Agriculture is proposing to go in for bulk warehous-
ing in Central Consuming Centers to which fertilizers will be consigned
from the ports/fertilizer plants in rakes, from there to be distributed by
road to the areas in the zone served by the Central Consuming Center.
Similarly, more loading of indigenous fertilizers is being planned in train
loads from the fertilizer factories to the consuming points.
Cement
3.7       In order to reduce the lead of cement traffic, the Government is
setting up of more cement factories in the northern region of India where
the demands are heavy. These include factories at Poanta, Bhupendra, Dehra
Dun and in Rajasthan. Cement industry is cooperating in loading cement in
block rakes. The industry is being persuaded to form more concentrated loads
which may bypass the intermediate yards. The idea of creating cement dumps
at certain points is also being developed to avoid transhipment en route.
For instance, a dump is being developed at Jogighopa station on the North-
east Frontier Railway to avoid transhipment at New Bongaigaon and from
January 1975 block rakes of cement have started moving to Jogighopa. Similar
proposals are also in hand for the provision of a dump at Narayanpur-Anant
station on the North Eastern Railway to avoid transhipment at Garhara. In
the case of Narayanpur-Anant, cement, foodgrains and fertilizers will be the
commodities going in block rakes from there to be distributed by road to
stations on MG. Besides, export traffic to Nepal will also be consigned to
this point to eliminate transhipment at Garhara. Further movement from these
dumps will be by road.
POL
3.8       Traffic in POL ideally lends itself to movement in train-loads.
This is increasingly arranged. About 60% of POL traffic is now moving in
block rakes for single point destinations as against about 50% last year.
Full length sidings for accomodating full train loads have been provided at
all important locations. Such sidings are being provided at some more
locations such as Manmad, Nishatpura, Badneral, Bilaspur, Khapri, Idgah,
Itarsi, Cuttack, and Sanatnagar. It is also proposed to introduce night
loading/unloading at important locations like Bombay Refineries, Kandla
and Vadala (serving Bombay port) Port Installations and at Shakurbasti near
Delhi.
4.        Adoption of modern operating techniques to improve productivity
of marshalling yards, locomotive sheds, carriage and wagon depots, wagon
workshops, etc., with the help of work study and/or operations research
techniques is likely to further help in improving the wagon turnround. A
separate Operations Research Cell was set up in the Railway Board last year



ANNEX 7
Page 6
and it has already undertaken in hand some studies such as those on the
reorganization of local pilots in the Delhi area, improvement in the working
of the Jhansi yard, improvement in the functioning of the Bhusawal locomotive
shed, etc.
5.        An important factor to be reckoned with in making an assessment
of the likely wagon turnround at the end of the Program is the average lead
of freight traffic. When the Program was being finalized, the Planning
Commission had felt that due to change in the traffic mix and with the
projected increase in the short lead traffic like coal to steel plants and
washeries and medium lead traffic like iron ore for export, etc., the average
lead of traffic might decrease. IR's own assessment made at that time, how-
ever, was that the average lead might not decrease and might even increase
as happened during the 1969/70-1973/74 program. In fact the average lead of
revenue-earning traffic in the first 11 months of 1974/75 has been 697 km
against 692 km in the corresponding 11 months of 1972/73 and is the highest
so far. Should this trend continue in future also, it is bound to have
repercussions on the wagon turnround.
6.        On the above basis, the projected wagon turnround targets by gauge
for the two years 1975/76 and 1976/77 are set out as follows:
Wagon turnround targets (days)
Gauge                    1975/76           1976/77
Broad gauge              13.5-14.0         13.0-13.5
Meter gauge              11.0-11.5         10.5-11.0
7.        In addition to the monthly routine review by IR of wagon turnrounds
achieved, it is proposed that, on a biannual basis (April/May and October/
November), mid-appraisal is made, including the analysis of actual perform-
ance and corrective measures to be taken. The Association will be kept
informed of such mid-appraisal.

APPRAISAL OF A THIRTEENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
IR Project Evaluation Procedures
A.   Description of Present Procedures
1.        The Railway's planning, evaluation and project sanctioning system
has developed over a number of years. The system is contained in various
codes and policy directives issued from time to time by IR.
2.        Within the framework of the Five-Year Plan, the Zonal Railways
prepare their tentative proposals for works under various Plan-heads and
sponsor them for inclusion in the Annual Plan at an appropriate time.
3.        According to existing instructions, all works costing above
Rs 50,000 each are required to be included in the Annual Works Program
which is submitted by the Zonal Railways to the Board. Works costing up
to Rs 50,000 each are finalized by the General Managers against the lump
sum amount allotted to the Zonal Railways.
4.        The Zonal Railways are required to send their schemes costing
Rs 1 million or above, comprehensively worked out with full details in-
cluding financial implications, by April 30 of each year for obtaining the
administrative approval of the Board for including them in the Railways
Preliminary Works Program. In the Board's Office these proposals are ex-
amined by the concerned directorate (Planning, Executive Directorate con-
cerned and Finance) in order to see that there is a prima facie case for
considering the inclusion of these works, depending upon the development
of traffic and availability of resources. This preliminary scrutiny is
to ensure that works unlikely to be approved are not included even in the
Preliminary Works Program for consideration at the Board's level during
the Works Program Meetings.
5.        In April each year, the Zonal Railways are asked to indicate their
requirement of funds, based on the works which they propose to include in the
Works Program. In June each year, the Board conveys to each Zonal Railway
the financial ceiling within wh'ch the Works Program has to be framed by the
railway. The distribution is done by Plan head as well as separately for
works in progress and new works depending upon the inter-railway priorities.
The Zonal Railways have then to modify and adjust their works programs within
this ceiling limit.
6.        All proposals for works estimated to cost approximately Rs 2 mil-
lion or above have to be appraised by an appropriate survey conducted by a
study tema constituted for the specific purpose at appropriate level. These
survey reports undergo a detailed scrutiny by the concerned directorates



ANNEX 8
Page 2
including Finance. It is only after the conclusions of the survey team are
accepted and the project is found financially justified that the proposal is
approved for inclusion in the annual works program.
7.        The Preliminary Works Program for the following year is submitted
by the Zonal Railways to the Board by about September 15, or such earlier
date as laid down by the Board. As stated earlier, all works costing above
Rs 50,000 are included, distinguishing modifications in works in progress
from new works. Project justification as well as financial appraisal for
each work has to be given in the Preliminary Works Program together with
the comments of the Financial Advisor and Chief Accounts Officer.
8.        After scrutiny of the Preliminary Works Program proposals in the
Board, a meeting is held between the Board and the concerned Zonal Railways
during October/November each year at which the proposals are discussed and
only those which are considered finally justified and complete in all
respects are permitted to be included in the Final Works Program of the
following year. On the basis of the decisions taken at the Works Program
Meetings, the Zonal Railways submit their Final Works Programs in December.
9.        All finally accepted proposals are then included in the budget
proposals (the "Pink Book") and these proposals are presented to the
Parliament along with the Annual railway budget for acceptance; for works
costing above Rs 2 million each, the Railway Minister's prior approval is
obtained. It is only after the Parliament gives its acceptance that approval
of the various proposals included in the "Pink Book" is considered valid and
the railways are permitted to go ahead with the execution of the works. The
estimates for works up to Rs 2 million each are then finally sanctioned by
the General Manager, while for works costing above Rs 2 million each the
estimates have to be sanctioned by the Board.
10.       While the above procedure is followed in respect of schemes to be
included in the regular Works Program provision also exists for sanction of
really urgent schemes as 'out of turn' works during the year. The Railways
have to bring out clearly the urgency and purpose of each scheme and certify
that the proposal meets the objective fully and the scope and costs of the
project have been arrived at after the fullest possible investigation in-
cluding financial implications. Urgent line capacity works costing up to
Rs 0.5 million each can be sanctioned by the General Manager, within an
overall allotment of about Rs 7.5 million in a year of the purpose. Works
costing above Rs 0.5 million each have to be referred to the Board for sanc-
tion. For works costing above Rs 2 million each, Miniter's prior approval
is obtained and Parliaments approval obtained through Supplementary Grants.
When Parliament is not in session, the Financial Commissioner can operate
the Contingency Fund of India for sanction of these works, which is
regularized subsequently through Supplementary Demands placed before the
Parliament.
11..      This procedure for sanction of 'out of turn' works is to ensure
that the movement of traffic is not hampered when unforeseen situations
develop.



ANNEX 8
Page 3
B.   Execution of Techno-Economic Surveys
12.       One important feature, which becomes apparent in review of IR's
investment program, is the number and great variety of projects. They vary
from new lines and plant and machinery to users' amenities, which involve,
for instance, improvement of passengers' travel accommodation. It can roughly
be estimated, that each year's annual program includes some 2,000 separate
items, which cost over Rs 500,000 (US$65,000) in various stages of completion.
Many of these items are, however, related to larger schemes, which anyway
constitute the major portion of the annual program. As indicated in para
6.14, there are 209 projects costing over Rs 5.0 million (US$650,000) in-
clude in the 1975/76-1976/77 programs. Together with rolling stock they
account for about Rs 7.0 billion (US$900 million), or 90%, of the total
investment program for the two project years. It is, therefore, important
that the justification of these major projects is on a sound basis. In the
following, the main features of a techno-economic survey for a railway line
project is presented. This procedure may, with some modifications, be
applied on new line projects, track renewals, bridge works, electrification
schemes and line capacity works, such as gauge conversions, etc. These
projects cover a substantial part of IR's revenue-earning infrastructure
projects.
Content of a Techno-Economic Survey
13.       Typically, the project study includes the following stages:
(i) preliminary investigation;
(ii) reconnaissance survey;
(iii) traffic survey;
(iv) preliminary survey; and
(v) final location survey.
As indicated below: (ii), (iv) and (v) are purely technical survey, while
(iii) and (iv) are normally conducted in conjunction with each other and
are most important for the decision making. As such the whole procedure
include all the elements of preinvestment, feasibility and final design
studies normally preceeding Bank/IDA financed projects.
14.       Preliminary Investigation.  This is undertaken in order to decide
whether the preparation of a project can be justified and to determine how
the proposed project will fit in with a general scheme of future railway
development and to obtain a preliminary view on the standard of construction
suitable in each case. According to the Railway Code, the preliminary
investigation should be based on a careful study of information already
available from existing maps, published figures of trade and population of



ANNEX 8
Page 4
the area to be served, and financial and statistical data of existing rail-
ways in similar areas. If it is decided that the project warrants further
consideration a report should be prepared with accompanying rough cost
estimates to be forwarded to the Railway Board, which has the authority to
sanction further surveys.
15.       Reconnaissance Survey.  This is essentially an engineering study
defined as a rough and rapid investigation of an area, or of one or more
routes for a projected railway line, but may also involve a more careful
investigation, involving, however, the use only of those instruments that
will give approximate measurements rapidly. The purpose of such surveys
is to provide a basis for estimating the approximate volume of further
survey work required and to reduce the number of alternatives to technically
feasible ones. Reconnaissance survey may be omitted if the project involves
improvement or expansion of an existing railway line.
16.       Preliminary Survey.  This, together with the traffic survey,
comprise all the elements of a typical project feasibility study. The
preliminary survey consists of a detailed instrumental examinzation of the
route or routes selected as a result of "reconnaissance" for the purpose of
obtaining a fairly close estimate of the probable project cost. Whether the
project is undertaken or not is usually decided on the basis of the result
of this survey in conjunction with the traffic survey. The Railway Board
may, however, require the submission of an estimate based on the final
location survey before sanctioning the project.
17.       Final Location Survey.  This represents primarily detailed
engineering of the project and is not normally undertaken before it has
been decided that the project should be undertaken.
Traffic Survey
18.       The traffic survey is defined by IR to be a detailed study of the
traffic conditions and prospects of an area with the object of determining
the most promising route, the probably traffic, and the standard of construc-
tion. It also includes an evaluation of the return on capital the project
is expected to generate. This return is either calculated in financial
terms as the net revenue to be obtained (gross revenue of increased traffic
minus increased capital and operating expenditures) or in terms of cost
savings (for instance, in the case of rail renewals). This evaluation
is undertaken for the lifetime of the project and require traffic, cost
and revenue forecasts to be prepared for this period for each alternative.
In undertaking the evaluation, the discounted cash value techique is applied,
which implies converting all future costs and revenues to present value by
application of a selected discount rate (the minimum acceptable by the Rail-
way Board is at present 10%).



ANNEX 8
Page 5
19.       The traffic survey includes thus considerably more than the term
implies. This becomes also apparent from the following subject items,
which have to be covered in each survey report:
(1) Background and terms of reference.
(2) General description of the area.
(3) Alternative routes and possible extensions.
(4) Location of route or routes examined.
(5) Population, volume of goods transported, exports and imports.
(6) Nature and volume of existing traffic using railways or
other modes of transport.
(7) Development prospects of trade and industry.
(8) Existing and proposed railway rates to be charged.
(9) Station sites.
(10)  Necessary train services.
(11)  Coaching earnings.
(12)  Goods earnings.
(13)  Effect on traffic on existing lines and alternative modes
of transport.
(14)  Construction standard and estimated capital cost.
(15)  Working expenses and net receipts.
(16)  Financial prospects of the proposal.
(17)  Conclusions and recommendations.
In addition, each report should be supported by a number of attachments,
providing details on population, land use, exports and imports of the
influence area, comparative transport tariffs of alternative modes of
transport, etc.
20.       The traffic survey is normally undertaken under the supervision
of an experienced Commercial Traffic Officer, who should work under close
cooperative with the engineering survey party. One of his main objectives
is to estimate the volume of traffic to be expected. These estimates
should be checked with actual traffic surveys, which should include other



ANNEX 8
Page 6
modes of transport as well. In addition, the survey should cover a review
of major present and expected future users.
Concluding Remarks
21.       The techno-economic surveys undertaken by the railways are closely
similar to investment studies undertaken by any private industry. The two
most important criteria in deciding on the feasibility of a project are the
estimated capital cost and expected financial return. The survey reports
reviewed by the mission were generally well prepared, although variations in
quality exists and further refinements are possible. This is, however,
understandable in view of differences in qualifications of staff in the
various Zonal Railways. As a whole, the surveys appear to reflect relatively
well the financial viability of the projects studied.
22.       The surveys do not include an economic evaluation of projects.
Such studies are only undertaken by the Economic Unit in the Railway Board
and limited to a few major projects such as new lines, gauge conversions,
electrification schemes, etc. The Economic Unit has, however, undertaken
comparative studies of differences between the financial and economic rates
of return for a number of projects. The result of these studies indicates
that the economic rate of return was in no case lower than the financial
and in no case did these two approaches result in contradictory recommenda-
tions. This result was not unexpected because the financial returns have in
recent years been gradually reduced as tariff increased have lagged behind
increases in costs (the situation did however change in 1974/75 after the
substantial rate and fare increases). Furthermore, the physical data base
for both evaluations were the same. The comparative study indicated that,
on average, the economic rate of return was about 20% in cases where the
financial rate of return was 10-12%. This conclusion is however not to be
generalized to apply for all IR projects; there are significant differences
between ccst saving projects and investments creating additional capacity.
23.       As a further improvement, economic evaluation should gradually
be introduced for all projects and undertaken as an essential part of the
techno-economic surveys (para 3.23). This would enable the Economic Unit
to participate in the formulation of the studies at an earlier stage and
reduce overlapping of work which at present is to some extent unavoidable.

ANNEX 13

INDIA
APPRAISAL OF A THIRTEENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Economic Evaluation
A. IR's 1974/75-1978/79 Investment Program
1.        IR's 1974/75-1978/79 investment program was examined in detail
on the basis of revised traffic forecasts (Annex 1 and Tables 17 and 18).
The examination indicates that it would be reasonable to maintain the
original investment outlay of Rs. 23.5 billion (US$3.0 billion equivalent)
(Table 7) unchanged, although the freight traffic forecasts have been sub-
stantially reduced from about 280 million tons to about 250 million tons
(of which 230 million tons revenue earning) to be carried in 1978/79 (Annex 1).
The main reason for this conclusion has been the price development. The
original investment program was based on 1972/73 prices, by 1974/75 they had
already increased by 35%. A further annual increase of about 10% is to
be expected for the remaining four years of the investment period. On this
basis, the original outlay of Rs. 23.5 billion is reduced to about Rs. 14.0
billion (US$1.8 billion equivalent) in real terms (Table 7). After deduct-
ing investments in necessary replacements of Rs. 7.5 billion (US$0.95 bil-
lion equivalent), the resources available for investments in additional
capacity would be about Rs. 6.5 billion (US$0.825 billion equivalent) in real
terms, as compared with the Rs. 16.0 billion (US$2.0 billion equivalent)
originally allocated, or about 40% of the original program. This combined
with improved wagon utilization, as outlined in Annex 7, will enable the
railways to meet an anticipated traffic demand of about 250 million tons
of freight (161.5 billion ton-km) and about 3.0 billion passengers (159.5 bil-
lion pass-km) in 1978/79 (Annex 1), corresponding to an annual growth of
3.4% for freight for passenger traffic. Originally the railways was targeted
to carry about 280 million tons of freight (190 billion ton-km in 1978/79),
while the present freight carrying capacity is estimated at about 220 million
tons (about 145 billion ton-km). Therefore, the additional capacity to be
created by 1978/79 is about 30 million tons, or about 50% of the original
proposal of 60 million tons.
B.   Evaluation of Railway Investment
2.        A review of IR's techno-economic survey procedures is given in
Annex 7. IR has instituted techno-economic surveys to estimate the finan-
cial return on capital for projects costing Rs. 2.0 million (US$250,000)
or more by use of discounted cash flow (DCF) techniques. These surveys
cover technical aspects as well and are similar to those undertaken by
private industry in calculating the future profitability of planned in-
vestments. Although further refinements can be introduced, the techno-
economic surveys appear to reflect relatively well the financial return
of the projects. On the basis of a sample of projects which represent



ANNEX 13
Page 2
about 30% of the total investment value of Rs. 12.1 billion (US$1.5 bil-
lion) of all major projects costing Rs. 5.0 million (US8650,000) or more
now in progress or to be initiated during the project period 1975/76-
1976/77, this return appears to vary between 10% and 25%. The average
financial return appears to be about 15%. There are, however, some proj-
ects for which the return is less than the 10% minimum normally required
to sanction a project. The investment value of these projects, which
mainly represents new lines and gauge conversion schemes in less devel-
oped areas, is about 5% of the total investment program.  They have
been included for developmental reasons by the Government to help the
least developed segment of the population and in order to create employ-
ment opportunities. Including these projects, the average financial re-
turn is reduced to about 12%.
3.        The techno-economic project studies are supplemented for major
new projects, such as electrification schemes, new lines and gauge con-
version projects, by economic studies undertaken by the Economic Unit in
the Railway Board. These studies use to large extent some basic data as
the techno-economic studies, but make an attempt to assess the economic
feasibility of projects from the viewpoint of the national economy.
These attempts have not been altogether successful because the Economic
Unit has not been in the position to participate in the formulation of
techno-economic studies and because it in respect of traffic forecasts
has been obliged to use the overall framework established by the Planning
Commission. Both these problems have been gradually alleviated through
IR's corporate planning exercise and by changing the position of the
Economic Unit.
4.        Although it is the view of the appraisal mission that most of the
projects sanctioned by the Railway Board --- either on the basis of techno-
economic or economic studies --- are feasible and provide a return exceed-
ing 10% on the investments, no overall estimate on the relative economics
of the railways as compared with alternative modes of transport has been
developed in the past. Such an estimate does not, of course, justify the
individual projects. It does, however, provide useful measure of the
additional cost to the economy if no investments were to be undertaken in the
railways and any increases in traffic had to be carried by other modes of
transport. The following evaluation has been based on work done by the
Economic Unit in the Railway Board.
C.   Overall Economic Rate of Return on Railway Investments
5.        Three basic alternative approaches to railway investment policy
might be considered:
(a) undertake the revised 1974175-1978/79 investment
program as presented in this report to meet the
anticipated traffic demand;



ANN X 13
Page 3
(b) undertake investments in essential replacements
only, while any traffic increase exceeding the
present capacity has to be catered for by alter-
native modes of transport; and
(c) no railway investments are undertaken during the
5-year period 1974/75-1978/79.
6.        The implications of these alternative policies are:
(a) the implementation of the investment program will
enable the railways to carry the projected traffic
volumes of 250 million tons of freight (166.6 bil-
lion net ton-km) and 3.0 billion passengers (159.5
billion pass-km); the railways operating costs have
conservatively been assumed to remain unchanged in
constant prices;
(b) investments in essential replacements only would
enable the railways to meet the traffic demand up
to its present capacity, which is estimated at 220
million tons of freight (145.6 billion net ton-km)
and 2.7 billion passengers (135.6 billion pass-km);
any additional traffic would have to be catered for
by an alternative mode of transport; operating costs
have been assumed to remain unchanged in constant
prices; and
(c) the "no investment" alternative (even in replace-
ments) would result in a decline in the railways
capacity by 1978/79 to 200 million tons of freight
(132 billion net ton-km) and 2.3 billion passengers
(115 billion pass-km); any additional traffic volumes
would have to be handled by alternative modes of trans-
port; at the same time the railways operating costs
have been assumed to increase by 3% a year.
7.        Alternatives (b) and (c) have been compared with (a) on the basis
of economic costs by assuming that the traffic exceeding the rail capacity
has to be catered for by road transport. For alternative (b) this volume
represents 30 million tons of freight (21 billion ton-km) and 300 million
passengers (24 billion pass-km) and for alternative (c) 50 million tons of
freight (34.6 billion ton-km) and 700 million passengers (44.5 billion
pass-km). In the latter case, the reduction in capacity has mainly been
based on a gradual attrition of rolling stock resulting from scrapping of
over-aged or otherways unrepairable locomotives, wagons and coaches.
8.        The results of the comparison are shown in Table 19 and the basis
for the calculations in Attachment 1. The results indicate that economic
rate of return would be about 24%, if the "no rail investment" alternative



ANNEX 13
Page 4
(c) is compared with alternative (b), in which IR investments are limited
to essential replacements (Rs. 7.5 billion), while the traffic exceeding
the present capacity of 145.6 billion ton-km and 135.6 billion pass-km has
to be carried by road. The major part of benefits are obtained from lower
transport costs for alternative (b) over the economic life of 20 years and
avoidance of continuous investments in roads and road transport to meet rail
transport volumes of 24 billion ton-km and 21 billion pass-km which have to
be diverted to road transport in alternative (c). Due to a gradual deteri-
oration in IR's rolling stock and infrastructure and an increased share
of road transport in case of alternative (c), average transport cost per
traffic unit (ton or pass-km) would increase to Paise 6.3 (USd0.8 equiv-
alent) over a period of 20 years while the cost for alternative (b) would
remain at Paise 3.9 (USd0.5 equivalent).
9.        A comparison of alternative (b) with alternative (a) indicates
that the economic rate of return would be about 17% for increasing the
investment from replacements only (Rs. 7.5 billion) to include also in-
vestments (Rs. 16.0 billion) to cater for additional traffic as proposed
in this report. Such increase in rail investments may therefore be con-
sidered justified as the marginal rate of return is close to, but above,
the opportunity cost of capital in India (assumed to be about 15%). The
main benefits are obtained from a further reduction in operating costs
by about 12% to Paise 3.4 (USe 0.4 equivalent), as all of the expected
traffic increase would be carried by the railways.
10.       The economic rate of return for the whole IR 1974/75-1978/80 in-
vestment program of Rs. 23.5 billion has been estimated at about 20% as
indicated in Table 19, on the basis of comparison of alternatives (a) and
(C). This return represents the weighted average return for the two cases
discussed in paras. 8 and 9 above, i.e., (i) increasing the rail investments
from nothing (alternative (c)) to Rs. 7.5 billion to meet necessary replace-
ments (alternative (b)) giving an economic rate of return of about 24'%; and
(ii) increasing rail investments from Rs. 7.5 billion to Rs. 23.5 billion
to cater in full for IR's investment program for 1974/75-1978/79 (alterna-
tive (a)), giving an economic rate of return of about 17%. It is important
to note that the return on IR's full investment prograns may have been
underestimated to some extent, because not all of IR's investments relate
to railway transport. Part of the investments are undertaken in staff
quarters, staff welfare, users' amenities, etc. (Table 7). Also, the cost
differences between rail and road transport were deflated to some extent
because the road transport costs were based on efficient road transport,
with full utilization of a modern fleet, while the rail transport costs
were based on IR's average operating efficiency during early 1970's. The
1974/75-1978/79 investment program is based on a slightly improved opera-
tional efficiency.

APPRAISAL OF A THIRTEENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Details of Economic Evaluation
A.   Traffic
1.        The economic evaluation has been undertaken for three alternatives,
each of them relating to the same total traffic volume, but carried in vary-
ing proportions by rail or road. According to the forecast, the total traf-
fic has been assumed at 250 million tons of freight (166.6 billion net ton-
km) and 3.0 billion passengers (159.5 billion pass-km) to be carried by the
end of the Fifth Five-Year Plan period in 1978/79.
B.  Alternatives
2.        IR's investment program 1974/75-1978/79 is defined as alternative
(a) and implies an investment of Rs. 23.5 billion, including Rs. 7.5 bil-
lion for necessary replacements during the 5-year period. This alternative
will meet the forecast traffic volume in full.
3.        Alternative (b) is defined to include investments in IR's neces-
sary replacements only (Rs. 7.5 billion). This alternative would imply
that IR's existing capacity would remain unchanged during the 5-year period.
This capacity has been assessed by IR and the mission at 220 million tons
of freight (146 billion net ton-km) and 2.6 billion passengers (136 billion
pass-km). According to this alternative, the railways would be able to meet
an increase in traffic up to this level (according to forecast, at about the
end of the project period in 1976/77). The expected increase during the
last two years of the investment period, 30 million tons of freight (21 bil-
lion net ton-km) and 400 million passengers (24.5 billion pass-km), would
have to be catered for by road transport.
4.        Alternative (c), would imply no investments in the railways, and
represents thus the "without" case. According to this alternative IR would
be able to meet the increase in traffic up to the level of the existing
capacity as in alternative (b) and maintain this traffic level up to the
end of the investment period in 1978/79. Thereafter, however, the capac-
ity would gradually decrease to 200 million tons of freight (132 billion
net ton-km) and 2.3 billion passengers (115 billion pass-km) by 1999/2000,
due to gradual scrapping of rolling stock and deterioaration of the infra-
structure. In reality, the deterioration may be even more rapid, but a
conservative approach has been chosen for this evaluation. This alterna-
tive would thus imply that by 1979/80 about 30 million tons of freight



ANNEX 13
Attachment 1
Page 2
(21 billion net ton-km) and 400 million passengers (24.5 billion pass-km)
would be carried by road, increasing gradually to 50 million tons of freight
(34.6 billion net ton-km) and 700 million passengers (44.5 billion pass-km)
by 1999/2000.
C.   Evaluation Period
5.        The evaluation period has been selected as the 25-year period
1974/75 to 1999/2000, of which the 20 years 1979/80-1999/2000 represents
the project life and the first 5 years the initial investment period.
Because of the effect of the discounting factor it does not serve any
practical purpose to extend the evaluation period further.
D.   Investment Costs
6.        The unit investment costs for railways are as indicated in Annex 10
excluding, however, price contingencies for investments undertaken after
1975/76.
7.        The investment costs for road transport have been estimated as
follows:
Trucks
-    Purchase price       Rs. 84,000 (including taxes)
Rs. 50,000 (excluding taxes)
-    Load capacity 10 tons, load factor 75%,
average load per trip 7.5 tons
-    Annual performance 65,000 km or about 500,000
net ton-km
Buses
-    Purchase price       Rs. 134,000 (including taxes)
Rs. 80,000 (excluding taxes)
-    Seating capacity 54 passengers, load factor 75%,
average number of passengers 40.5 per trip
-    Annual performance 75,000 km or about 3.0 million
pass-km



ANNEX 13
Attachment i
Page 3
Roads
-    Construction cost of a 2-lane paved road about
Rs. 1.0 million per km
-    Capacity utilization 2000 vehicles per day,
implying for trucks:
7.5 x 2000 x 365 = 5.5 millin net ton-km/year
and for buses:
40.5 x 2000 x 365 = 29.5 million pass-km/year
Both these estimates are intentionally based on
intensive road utilization to arrive at conservs-> v.e
estimates in respect of the economic feasi.:,. ty ut.s
rail investments.
E.   Total Investment Requirements
8.        For railways the investment requirements are as presented in the
appraisal report.
9.        For road transport the investment requirements have been cal-
culated as follows:
(i)  Alternative (b)
Trucks
To carry 21 billion net ton-km by 1978/79, about 40,000
trucks would be required (each with an average annual
performance of 500,000 net ton-km). This would involve
an investment of about Rs. 2.0 billion (Rs. 50,000 per
truck in economic costs) which has been assumed to be
distributed over the three years 1976/77-1978/79.
Buses
To carry 24.5 billion pass-km by 1978/79, about 8,000
buses would be required (each with an average annual
performance of 3.0 million pass-km). This would involve
an investment of about Rs. 640 million (Rs. 80,000 in
economic cost per bus). As for trucks, this investment
has been assumed to be distributed over the three years
1976/77-1978/79.



ANNEX 13
Attachment 1
Page 4
It has been assumed that both trucks and buses have an
economic life of ten years requiring similar investments
in 1987/88-1989/90 and 1997/98-1999/2000.
Roads
The investment requirement in roads has been calculated
by estimating how many kilometers of road would be re-
quired to carry the 21 billion net ton-km and the 24.5
billion pass-km by using the very high road utilization
ratios in para. 7. For freight traffic this would
imply about 3800 km of road (5.5 million net ton-km
per km of road per year) and for passenger traffic about
800 km of road (29.5 million pass-km per km of road per
year). Together this would represent an investment of
Rs. 4.6 billion, which has been distributed over the
3-years 1976/77-1978/79. It can safely be said that the
investment could easily be as high as Rs. 6.0 billion
with a realistic utilization of a 2-lane highway of
1250 heavy vehicles per day.
(ii) Alternative (c)
The initial investment in trucks, buses and road infra-
structure would be as for alternative (b) above. However,
additional investments would be required from 1979/80
to meet the increased demand for road transport result-
ing from the gradual diversion of rail transport to road
during the period 1979/80-1999/2000. In average this
diversion would be 1 million tons of freight (680 mil-
lion net ton-km) and 20 million passengers (1.0 bil-
lion pass-km) a year. This would require the following
additional annual investments:
Trucks
About 1350 additional trucks per year (680 million net
ton-km, 0.5 million per truck) at a total annual invest-
ment of Rs. 67.5 million.
Buses
About 330 additional buses per year (1.0 billion pass-km,
3.0 million pass-km per bus) at a total annual investment
of Rs. 26.5 million.
Roads
About 190 km of road required per year at an investment
of Rs. 190 million.



ANNEX 13
Attachment 1
Page 5
The total additional annual investment would therefore
be about Rs. 280 million to cater for the traffic di-
verted gradually from rail to road. For trucks and
buses there would be a doubting of the additional in-
vestment after 10 years to meet replacement require-
ments.
F.   Operating Costs
10.       According to IR, the operating costs for railways are as follows:
Financial Cost     Economic Cost
Freight, ton-km                  Paise 4.48         Paise 4.28
Pasengers, pass-km               Paise 2.69         Paise 2.57
The difference between financial and economic cost is small because the tax
element is insignificant and has been decreasing in recent years (tax on
diesel oil was substantially reduced in 1974 after the increase in import
costs of crude oil).
11.       The operating costs for trucks and buses have been established on
the following basis:
Trucks
-    Fuel consumption 40 liters per 100 km
-    Fuel cost Rs. 1,000 per kilo-liter (financial)
Rs.   680 per kilo-liter (economic)
-    Fuel cost per km Rs. 0.40 (financial)
Rs. 0.27 (economic)
-    Wages, insurance, etc. per truck a year Rs. 21,000
per km Rs. 0.31 (financial)
Rs. 0.26 (economic)
-    Repair, maintenance and other expenses
per km Rs. 0.31 (financial)
Rs. 0.23 (economic)
Total operating costs per km Rs. 1.02 (financial)
Rs. 0.76 (economic)
Operating costs per ton-km   Rs. 0.136 (financial)
Rs. 0.101 (economic)



ANNEX 13
Attachment I
Page 6
Buses
-    Fuel consumption 40 liters per 100 km
-    Fuel cost as above for trucks
-    Wages, insurance, etc. per bus a year Rs. 70,200
per km Rs. 0.94 (financial)
Rs. 0.82 (economic)
-    Repair, maintenance and other expenses
per km Rs. 0.48 (financial)
Rs. 0.38 (economic)
Total operating costs per km Rs. 1.82 (financial)
Rs. 1.47 (economic)
Operating costs per pass-km  Rs. 0.0449 (financial)
Rs. 0.0362 (economic)
12.       Road maintenance costs have been assumed to be about Rs. 9,500
per km with the very high road utilization ratios. For alternative (c)
they have been assumed to increase in relation to the additional road
length required for each year.
G.   Concluding Remarks
13.       The following additional remarks may be required for full under-
standing of the calculations presented in Table 19.
(i)  For alternative (a), the operating costs have been
obtained by multiplying the economic cost separately
for ton-km and for pass-km with the total volume of
rail traffic in 1978/79 (166.5 billion net ton-km and
159.5 billion passOkm). The total operating costs have
been kept constant for the whole period 1979/80-1999/2000
as no change have been assumed to take place in the unit
costs and as the evaluation relates to the rail traffic
in 1978/79.
(ii)  A similar exercise has been undertaken for alternative (b)
except assuming that the rail traffic will be limited to
the existing capacity (146.5 billion net ton-km and 136
billion pass-km); the remaining portion of the traffic
(21 billion net ton-km and 24.5 billion pass-km) has been
assumed to be carried by road at the economic cost in
para. 10 (Paise 10 per net ton-km and Paise 3.62 for
pass-km).



ANNEX 13
Attachment 1
Page 7
(iii) For alternative (c), the operating costs for 1979/80 have
been calculated on the same basis as for alternative (b).
However, for each subsequent year, the rail transport
costs have been calculated by applying a 3% annual
increase in the unit ton-km and pass-km costs, to a
gradually decreasing rail transport volume (annual de-
crease 680 million ton-km and 1.0 billion pass-km): the
road transport volume has been increased correspondingly
for each year.
(iv) The economic rates of return for the alternatives have
been calculated on a marginal basis, i.e., by calculating
the return on the difference in investment costs between
the alternatives on the basis of the difference in annual
operating and maintenance costs.

Basis:  (1)  Firstly, the replacement requirements of locomotives, wagons, coaches and EMUs were catered
for in full.
(2) Then, on the assumption that the growth of passenger traffic will take place as scheduled,
full requirements of coaches andtEMUs were catered for and requisite locomotives on additional
account therefore were provided,
(3) The balance amount was then distributed between wagons-46,000 (in 4-wheeler terms) and
locomotives-305 to be procured on additional account to cater to the additional freight
traffic (about 25 million tonme) to be carried by 1978/79 and exceeding the present
capacity of about 220 million tons.

unvenumerative capital. The mount of this relief was about Rs 200 million a yedr.

IR Balance Sheet - March 31, 1974
1.   Fixed Assets
The value of fixed assets shown in the balance sheet is their
original cost, except that additional cost of like-for-like replacements over
their original cost (the inflationary element) is charged against DRF.
The full cost of all assets including the additional cost of replacements
is Rs. 54,928 million. Included in this total are works in progress, land
and other non-depreciable assets amounting to Rs 7,248 million. The book
value of depreciable assets is:
Rs. millions
Total fixed assets                54,928
Less non-depreciable               7,248
47.68DO
2.   Depreciation Reserve Fund
This balance in the fund represents cumulative contributions to
date less (a) cost of assets withdrawn from service, and (b) full cost of
replacements.
3.   Inventories
These are financed from Capital-at-charge.
4.   Investment Financed from Railway Sources
These are the published figures representing amounts the Railways
provide from their own sources over the years towards the Capital invest-
ment programs. In recent years net earnings have been insufficent to meet
the full cost of expenditure charged to the Development Fund and the full
dividend payment due to the Government. Consequently in order to meet
these shortfalls, Indian Railways has drawn temporary loans from the Central
Government to ensure that its funds did not become overdrawn. The outstand-
ing temporary loans at March 31, 1974, which have been drawn to augment the
fund balances, are shown in Indian Railway's balance sheet only by way of
note and are as follows:

shown in the above balance sheet since these funds are held in Special
deposit accounts specifically for paying benefits to employees. Contri-
butions to the fund are charged to operating expenses.

APPRAISAL OF A THIRTEENTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Indian Railways' Revenue and Expenditure Forecast - 1975-80
1.        The prices used in the forecasts - for freight rates, passenger
fares and operating costs - are at April 1975 levels.
2.        The estimates, therefore, take account of the three major influ-
ences which have occurred over the past one to two years:
(a) the revision of tariffs (including the removal of
the foodgrain and ore subsidies from 1975) in the
period 1974/75;
(b) increased cost of fuel oil and coal; and
(c) the wage awards and dearness allowances sanctioned by the
Government, the latest being effective from September 1, 1974.
3.        The revenue forecasts therefore only reflect the increase in
traffic anticipated in the period 1975-80. They do not take account of
any further adjustment in tariff or fare levels.
4.        Operating expenses are based on a detailed analysis of 1975/76
budget data, related to freight and passenger traffic forecasts for that
base year and then projected as a constant ratio between the three main
elements:
Personnel                 63.8X
Fuel                      18.1%
Other Costs & Stores      18.1%
5.        Depreciation provisions are based on a total appropriation in
the Fifth Plan of Rs. 6500 million.
6.        Traffic is projected to increase by 21% over 1975/80.  Passenger
traffic is forecast conservatively to increase at about 4% per annum. Rev-
enue earning freight traffic is projected to increase from 190 million tonnes
in 1975/76 to 246 million tonnes by 1979/80 - an increase of 29.5%. The
increase in freight revenues, reflecting traffic volume increase only, is
22.9%. Even if the low estimate of freight revenue should prove more likely,
(see Table 18) the requirements of the earnings covenant would be met.



NOTES ON TABLE 11
Page 2
7.        In forecasting working expenses, IR have calculated on a ratio
of variable to fixed expenditure of 78.5:21.5 and applied this to an
analysis of goods and passenger traffic volume. This was based on the
1975/76 budget figures and therefore again reflects prices at April 1975.
8.        On the assumption, however, that staff costs would increase by
at least 2-1/2% per annum, that fuel costs would remain variable with
traffic and that other costs would increase by 5% per annum, it is cal-
culated that IR would, to meet the requirements of the earnings covenant,
need to increase tariffs by about 2% each year.
9.        For freight traffic the average annual growth in revenues from
1975/76 is 5.25% (Table lla) and for passenger traffic 4.0%. The volume
of freight traffic in terms of ton-km is expected to increase by 3.4%
annually (Table 18).  Average receipt per ton-km of freight which was
Paise 7.3 in 1974/75, is expected to rise to Paise 7.9 in 1975/76 and drop
slightly to Paise 7.8 by 1979/80. Average receipt per pass-km throughout
the period 1975/76 to 1979/80 is estimated at Paise 3.6 (Paise 7.85 =
US Cent 1.0).
10.       Operating expenses are based on a detailed analysis of 1975/76
budget data, related to freight and passenger traffic forecasts for that
base year and projections for following years take account of the forecast
steady growth in traffic. Working Expenses in 1979/80 have been assessed
at a level 17% higher than in 1975/76 while traffic growth in terms of train
movements is likely to increase by about 21%. The assumption that about
78% of expenses vary directly with traffic growth may be excessive but
nonetheless for appraisal purposes, it is considered prudent and realistic
to accept expenditure estimates on this conservative basis.
