                         The objective of the Project is to improve access to quality education in Indonesia for all children of ages 7 to 15 by strengthening school-based management and
                         community participation, improving existing fiduciary arrangements for greater transparency and accountability of the BOS program and, consequently, bringing about
                         better utilization of BOS funds.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1.          BOS-KITA AF continues to strengthen BOSNAS fiduciary standards and transparency and accountability of School BasedManagement and BOS fund use. Progress has
                         been satisfactory within GoI's existing policy environment and institutional arrangementswith BOS the most important source of funds under school control. On April 4, 2012 100% of
                         the SIL had been disbursed.

                         2. ThePDO is relevant and achievable: BOS is regarded as transformative but needs to be supplemented with BOSDA. Currently BOS representsapproximately 80% of school
                         discretionary funds. Improved access to basic education for all children has been enabled within-school costs reduced and a decrease in real costs faced by poor households.

                         Regional Independent Monitoring findings show a 50%increase in SBM practices leading to increased transparency and accountability for good governance e.g.(i) School
                         Committees thatapprove annual budget plans: 2009 4%; 2011 80%. However more involvement is needed to validate actual fund use and oversee theprocurement of small goods; (ii)
                         Disclosure of BOS expenditure by category on an accessible notice board: 2009 20%; 2011: 33%demonstrating a slow but positive trend towards public disclosure of BOS fund use
                         by schools.

                         3.          In Quarters 1 and 2 2012 themost significant development was the speed at which BOS funds were disbursed through the Provincial Block Grant mechanisminstituted in
                         January 2012. The May 2012 review found that in the schools visited BOS had enabled: (i) improved education servicedelivery evidenced by increased NER results and student
                         performance in competitions; (ii) increased access for students from poorfamilies; (iii) increased oversight of the program by stakeholders; and, (iv) schools to plan for school needs
                         on the basis ofa defined BOS budget allocation. Ongoing challenges included: (i) eligible and ineligible BOS expenditure category limitations;(ii) perceived inability of parents to make
                         contributions to the school; (iii) BOSDA allocations which are inconsistent.

                         4.        Qualified Opinion findings of the recently released BPKP 2011 BOS audit of 193 of the 497 districts in Indonesia are of concern:(i) Implementation of internal control systems
                         significant weaknesses in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting on BOSfunds from Regional Treasury Accounts (RKUD) to school accounts. A total of IDR7.3 trillion in
                         Consolidated Financial Reports wasnot `fairly presented' as a result. (ii) Reliability of internal control systems which could not be assured due to: irregularitiesin financial statement
                         balances of funds disbursed to schools; delays in fund disbursement from the local Treasury to schools;unaccounted expenditures; fund allocations to schools less than enrolment
                         number entitlements. The Central BOS Management Team iscurrently working with Districts to respond to and address these findings.

                               These findings reflect the problemsanticipated with the 2011 decentralization of BOS fund disbursement (discussed in ISR Series 5 and other project documentation).This was a
                         massive change institutionally within complicated MoHA bureaucratic regulatory frameworks with human resourcesill-equipped to manage this level of change. Subsequent delays in
                         fund disbursement negatively affected all schools e.g. someresorted to unrecorded borrowing; SC was not as involved in school planning/budgeting process as time was of the
                         essence if fundswere to be disbursed (plans/budgets were the trigger for fund disbursement), essentially hampering/ eroding earlier gains in SBM;2011 fund disbursement was
                         completed in March 2012.

                         5.            BEC-TF and DESP TF continue to support the national BOS program. GoIis proactive in moving forward on major activities: (i) SBM and BOS fund use transparency and
                         accountability e.g. effectiveness ofactual expenditure within eligible expenditure classifications; media events such as BOS for the Golden Generation, July 13th 2012and
                         accompanying BOS video; (ii) formula-based BOSDA to address access and equity in school education funding to supplement BOSNAS;(iii) improving fiduciary arrangements for
                         greater transparency and accountability e.g. rapid analysis of the impact of MinisterialDecree No. 60/2012 about parental contributions and its incongruence with the BOS Manual
                         resulting in the release of supplementaryMoEC Decree 44 2012 to clarify fee collection and contributions to schools; (iv) development of a major management informationsystem
                         capable of reporting on school needs which builds on earlier EMIS work (to be launched in December 2012).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. BPKP 2011 audit result recommendations for follow-up action:
                         1.1 Allocation: Districts to send definitive grant receipt and transfer reports to CPIU; CPIU to reconcile actual transfer to schools in consolidated financial reports; DEO to report on
                         fund deficiencies/excesses to MoEC; DEO to transfer excess/remaining funds and interest to central account as DAU and transfer deficiencies identified to schools based on student
                         enrollment numbers; Schools to report on fund deficiencies/excesses and transfer excess funds to DEO.
                         1.2 Implementation: DEO to (i) improve BOS Financial Management capacity; (ii) review BOS recipient schools; (iii) ensure that they meet the requirements to receive BOS grants;
                         (iv) reprimand and ensure that those Principals charging school fees to poor students, or falsifying or non-compliant with BOS procurement, Taxation, Financial Administration (a)
                         complete all necessary documentation; (b) improve internal control systems; (c) pay Tax to the Central Account.
                         1.3 Reporting: District BOS Management Teams to instruct schools to (i) recap all remaining FY 2011 amounts; (ii) provide a report on excess BOS funds to MoEC; (iii) transfer
                         excess BOS funds to the district account. Currently the remaining amount reported by DEO to MoEC is IDR1,207,194,500 is inconsistent with the actual amount remaining in district
                         accounts: IDR1,35,902,500.
                         2. School Fees and Donations: MoEC Ministerial Decree Pernendikbud 44/2012: Fees and Donations in Schools were released to address the confusion and negative impact on
                         poor schools which resulted from MoEC Decree No. 60/2011 about parental contributions. Public and private school fee collection and allowable contributions are now specified: (i)

                         Public schools cannot collect fees but can receive voluntary donations not prescribed by the school; (ii) RSBI schools can collect fees to cover the gap between investment and
                         operational costs and receive voluntary donations; (iii) Private schools can collect transparently determined fees approved by the School Committee and receive voluntary donations.
                         Fee collection is prohibited for (i) students from poor families; (ii) student admissions, learning results and graduation; (iii) School Management and School Committee personal
                         needs. Donations of more than IDR5billion must be audit by a public accountant and published in national media. All income from fees and donations must be reported transparently
                         to stakeholders.
