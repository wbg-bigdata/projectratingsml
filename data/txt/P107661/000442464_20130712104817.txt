1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       Country Context. At appraisal, Indonesia had a population of over 220 million
and was a lower middle-income economy with a GDP per capita of US$1,920. Since the
economic and political crisis of the late 1990s, Indonesia had undergone a remarkable
institutional transformation with decentralization transferring responsibility for most
public service delivery to sub-national governments. Indonesia had restored its
macroeconomic and financial stability with prudent economic policies, as well as
extremely low budget deficits. Economic growth accelerated to a 10-year high of 6.3
percent in 2007. In 2007, the growth rate was sufficient to reduce poverty from 17.8 to
16.6 percent and reverse the trend of jobless growth, with unemployment falling from
10.3 to 9.1 percent.

2.      Sector Context. With over 46 million students and 2.8 million teachers in more
than 227,000 schools, Indonesia had the fourth-largest education system in the world,
almost similar in size to the United States. Two major ministries were responsible for
managing the education system, with 82 percent of schools under the Ministry of
Education and Culture (MoEC) (formerly the Ministry of National Education) and 18
percent under the Ministry of Religious Affairs (MoRA). Indonesia had almost achieved
universal primary enrollment but only 55 percent of children from low-income families
were enrolled in junior secondary schools. Indonesia continued to rank low in
international standardized tests of student performance. In 2003, Indonesia ranked 34 out
of 45 countries in the Trends in International Mathematics Science Study (TIMSS). In the
2006 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), which looks at how well 15-
year-old students are prepared for life, Indonesia ranked around 50 out of 57 countries in
each of the categories of science, reading and math.

3.      Indonesia sought to address structural problems in the legal and legislative
framework governing education by passing laws that emphasized that all Indonesian
citizens have the right to education and that the Government has an obligation to finance
basic education without charging fees. Although the law and regulations were passed in
2003, it was only in 2005, with the introduction of Bantuan Operasional Sekolah (School
Operational Assistance Program-BOS) 1 , - that schools received sufficient operational
funds to waive or reduce parents’ contributions. The BOS program was, and continues to
be, regarded as a key pillar of the Government’s basic education policy, as it provides
funding directly to schools for school operations and uses elements of school-based
management (SBM) for the implementation of the program. Specifically, the BOS
program aimed to: (i) improve access to education by eliminating school fees for poor

 BOS is a national program that involves, amongst others, Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC);
Ministry of Regional Affairs (MoRA); Ministry of Finance (MoF); National Planning Agency (Bappenas);
Financial and Development Supervisory Board Internal Audit Agency (BPKP), State Audit Agency (BPK),
Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA) and selected local governments.



                                                 1
students and lowering fees for other students; (ii) enhance the quality of education; and
(iii) accelerate the achievement of near universal enrollment at the junior secondary
school level. The BOS SBM approach was based on lessons learned from the
Scholarships and Grants Program (SGP) and the School Improvement Grant Program
(SIGP). These programs pioneered the provision of block grants to Indonesian schools to
mitigate the impact of the Asian economic crisis on student enrollment and drop-outs.
The expectation was that SBM would lead to more efficient use of resources and
improved student achievement. In 2007, the Government took another step in cementing
SBM and parental involvement with regulations, which further enhanced the role of
school committees.

4.      Project Context. The BOS-KITA project was essentially an on-budget transfer of
US$1.1 billion over a four year period to support an existing nationwide government
education program. The BOS-KITA project marked a shift in the Bank’s approach to
investment lending focused on Education for All (EFA) goals. It was designed to support
and add value to the Government of Indonesia’s (GoI) school grants program, the
national BOS, in order to improve access to quality education for all children aged 7–15.
The project fit within the Bank’s strategy of supporting ongoing nation-wide programs
that were within the overall policy focus of the Bank. Achievement of the MDG and EFA
targets as well as expanding education access to children of poor families fit squarely
within the Bank’s overall strategy, and was a continuation of the Bank’s education
program with Indonesia. The Bank’s funds were made available to the GoI based on: (i)
the government’s compliance with the mutually agreed upon criteria stipulated in the
BOS Operations Manual and (ii) supervision of BOS-KITA project activities and overall
progress toward achieving the project PDOs. The Bank transferred funds quarterly to the
Ministry of Finance to reimburse quarterly expenses incurred in supporting the National
BOS program. The Bank’s impact on the improved fiduciary arrangements and
strengthened school based management and community participation was in the
recommendations made by and accepted by the GoI in the content and guidelines of the
BOS Operations Manual. There was a parallel Basic Education Capacity Trust Fund
Project (BEC-TF) 2 as well as the Dutch Education Support Program (DESP) 3 that
provided technical assistance and supported studies, conferences, study visits focused on
fiduciary and SBM issues, and workshops at the national level in support of BOS-KITA.
BOS awareness-raising was supported by the comprehensive Social Marketing and
Information Campaign (SMIC) funded under DESP which included national public

  BEC-TF support included: (i) Education Policy Advice and an Education Public Expenditure Review
(EPER); (ii) 2011 BOS National Training Program, design and development and materials production; (iii)
District BOS (BOS-Daerah BOSDA) and (iv) the Tool for Reporting and Information Management
(TRIMS) (refer to Annex 2).
3
  The Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, through the Dutch Education Support Program (DESP)
provided US$20 million in funding to support the BOS program. The support focused on four key
components: (i) monitoring, evaluation, regional independent monitoring and complaint handling; (ii) a
SMIC; (iii) training on BOS to BOS teams at the provincial, district, and school levels as well as to
members of the local community; and (iv) a comprehensive study on SBM.



                                                  2
service announcements, district events, school interventions and media relation activities
all focused on improving the accountability of the BOS program.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

5.      The project development objective was to improve access to quality education in
Indonesia for all children of ages 7 to 15 by strengthening school-based management and
community participation, improving existing fiduciary arrangements for greater
transparency and accountability of the BOS program and, consequently, bringing about
better utilization of BOS funds.

6.      Progress toward achieving the PDO for the initial two years of the BOS-KITA
project was measured against the following PDO Indicators: (i) primary net enrollment
rates (disaggregated by gender and income quintile); (ii) junior secondary enrollment
rates (disaggregated by gender and income quintile); (iii) dropout rates at the primary and
junior secondary levels of education; (iv) transition rates at the primary and junior
secondary levels of education; and (v) average monthly household expenditure per child
on education by the poorest quintile.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

7.      The PDO was not modified during the project implementation. In June 2010,
additional financing was provided for the project and at that time modifications were
made to the PDO indicators: (i) the wording for the dropout rate indicator was modified
from “% net dropout rates? to “dropout rate (%)?, due to a previous typing error; and (ii)
the baseline value of the PDO indicator “average monthly household expenditure per
student on education by poorest quintile? was increased due to a change in the calculation
of the expenditure which in 2010 included registration and other fees.

8.     The intermediate indicators were also modified during the June 23, 2010
Additional Financing. The first intermediate outcome—“improved management of BOS
funds by schools?—was dropped and replaced by three new indicators: (i) percent of
school committees that review and approve expenditure reports; (ii) percent of schools
that have a school improvement plan; and (iii) percent of schools with relevant
procurement plans. To assess progress for the second intermediate outcome— “increased
accountability through improved public information and dissemination of BOS? — two
new indicators were added: (i) percent of parents who know the unit cost of BOS; and (ii)
percent of parents who know the objectives of BOS.

9.      In January 2011, it was decided that the PDO indicator “average monthly
household expenditure per student on education by poorest quintile? would no longer be
monitored as part of the results framework due to the fact that there were too many
factors outside the control of the project that could affect it.




                                            3
1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10.     The targeted project beneficiaries were: 42 million primary and junior secondary
students; 190,000 primary and junior public and private schools distributed in the 33
provinces of Indonesia; more than 1,000,000 teachers, 190,000 principals and over 7,000
Provincial Offices of Education (POE) and District Offices of Education (DOE) staff and
directors, approximately 190,000 School Committees were to receive some form of
training for their added roles in school management4.

1.5 Original Components

11.     The BOS-KITA project had a single component named the “BOS Operation
Assistance School Grants?. The component was to supported the provision of BOS
Grants to BOS Schools to finance BOS eligible expenditures set out in the BOS
Operational Manual for: (i) the BOS 2008 Program; and (ii) BOS Grants under the
Project for the BOS 2009 and later programs.

1.6 Revised Components

The components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

12.     On June 23, 2010 the Bank approved Additional Financing in the amount of
US$500 million. The original Loan Agreement was amended to add the following: (i)
BOS Grants under part 1 of the Project for the BOS 2010 Program; and (ii) BOS Grants
under Part 2 of the Project for the BOS 2011 and later program; and (iii) a new closing
date of December 31, 2012. The additional financing was to undertake activities that
would scale up the project’s development effectiveness in light of: (i) implementation
experience to date; and (ii) an expected greater role of school districts in monitoring and
managing BOS. The underlying motivation for the Additional Financing was to move
BOS-KITA from simply being a project that strengthens fiduciary requirements to one
that also directly helped schools and districts make the critical link between assessing
school performance, planning for improvements and using funds (including BOS funds
from central and local governments) for needed improvements. School improvement
planning (that incorporates expected education standards), improved monitoring, gap-
financing by districts, and greater oversight by school committees was introduced under
the Additional Financing to help rationalize BOS funds from largely financing teachers’
remuneration and honoraria, and redirect resources (including BOS funds) toward other
school operation needs and student needs.


4
  Trainings involved an intensive 3-day program to support over 650,000 participants from primary and
junior secondary schools and madrasahs in 339 districts and 31 provinces to maximize the use of BOS and
other school resources for improved SBM. The program focused on planning for continuous improvement
of SBM through an integrated approach to introduce participants to and build core skills in: School Self-
Evaluation; Planning: Annual, Budget; Financial Management and Character Building.



                                                   4
13.    On November 17, 2011 there was a Level 2 restructuring and the Loan Agreement
was amended to increase the Bank disbursement from 40 percent to 100 percent. The
amendment enabled GoI to meet the financing gap it was experiencing that year and
accelerate slow disbursement at the district level. The revision did not change project
development objectives, outcome indicators, or safeguard status.

14.     It should also be noted that there is a discrepancy in the datasheet for the final
Development Objective (DO) rating between Section C.3: “Quality at Entry and
Implementation Performance Indicators? and Section G: “Rating of Project Performance
in ISR?. Section C.3’s rating for DO is “satisfactory? and is based on the analysis of the
September 2012 ISR. In December 2012, a final ISR was prepared, which downgraded
the DO rating to “moderately satisfactory? but was not archived until two days after the
project closed. Given that section C.3 only records the last DO rating of an active project,
the final ISR rating as archived in January 2013 was not registered by the system. Section
G reports all ISR ratings and therefore reflects the final analysis, which is in line with the
analysis of this ICR but differs from the information recorded by the system under
Section C.3.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry.

15.     Project Preparation. In 2008, and prior to project preparation, the GoI identified
an overall financing gap in their development budget. This gap became the basis for the
proposed overall loan amount. Once the amount of the loan had been agreed, GoI and the
Bank worked together to develop the BOS-KITA project. Critical to the preparation
process was a thorough review of the effectiveness of the BOS program itself. To this end,
the Bank preparation team prepared and used a number of assessments5 conducted both
internally and by other international organizations working in Indonesia such as the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) and USAID. The Bank preparation and appraisal teams
consisted of technical experts that were appropriate for the development of the project.
The preparation of the project was also spread over several months which were devoted
to an informed policy dialogue with the MoEC and MoRA, other ministries, academia,
NGOs and other donors, school stakeholders and community members. The BOS-KITA


5
  Some eight background papers were produced amongst which the more critical were: “Assessment in
Preparation for BOS-KITA?: Agustina, Cut Dian, Zaki Fahmi, Elif Yavuz (2008); and “Investing in
Indonesia’s Education: Allocation, Equity, and Efficiency in Public Expenditures?: Arze del Grando, Javier,
Wolfgang Fengler, Andy Ragatz and Elif Yavuz (2007). Additionally, some sixteen additional sources
were used extending from local and international studies on SBM to UNESCO and USAID reports on EFA
issues and implementation of other donor supported education projects in Indonesia. These assessments
systematically documented the early results and challenges of the BOS program and as such were important
for the development of the BOS-KITA project. A BOS Program Assessment (April 2010) was carried out
to inform the Additional Financing request.




                                                    5
project benefitted from a series of parallel and complimentary trust funds such as the
BEC-TF and DESP.

16.     The policy dialogue that the task team had during preparation also facilitated
modifications in the BOS Operations Manual. This was important because the BOS
Operations Manual was the key instrument used to guide the overall implementation of
the BOS program. The early discussion strengthened the financial arrangements for the
disbursements of the block grants directly to schools and clarified the expenditure
categories upon which the grant funds could be spent. The preparation team examined
critical risks such as: (i) the fact that other modes of funding could marginalize the
innovations of the BOS grants; (ii) effective school based management and community
participation may fail to materialize; and (iii) through BOS, the Bank could undermine
decentralization by supporting a central government program, which should ideally be
implemented thought district governments and identified mitigation measures. A
thorough economic and financial analysis as well as a detailed study of international
experience in school grants and SBM was completed as part of the project preparation
process. Lessons were also learned from the SGP and the SIGP both of which pioneered
the provision of block grants to Indonesian schools to mitigate the impact of the Asian
economic crisis on student enrollment and dropouts. In addition, lessons were learned
from the Community Driven Development (CDD) project which contained several
successful examples of community involvement which indicated that social pressure from
an informed local community could be a positive influence on reducing corruption and
misuse of funds. The preparation process was thoughtful, collaborative, and technically
sound, and to the extent possible, based on lessons learned from previous operations.

17.     Project Design. The strategic relevance and approach in project design were
appropriate. The project was fully consistent with the FY09-12 Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) for Indonesia that focused on the fact that the Bank’s program should be
on core engagements, through which the Bank would support the Government’s own
programs, blending Bank financing more directly in support of successful ongoing
government programs. Education was one of the Bank’s core sectoral engagements and
the BOS-KITA project was seen as a new way of working in Indonesia, starting with an
existing, effective GoI owned program for which Bank involvement could add value. The
project aimed at promoting good fiscal practices at the district and school levels, and
increased parental participation and community involvement to strengthen accountability
and transparency in the management of resources targeted to education. The project
remains fully consistent to the current CPS (FY12-15) with its focus on supporting
ongoing GoI programs in core strategic areas with education being one of these areas.

18.     The BOS-KITA development objective appropriately reflected the GoI’s goals for
the national BOS program with the addition of a PDO focus on improved fiduciary
arrangements and strengthened school based management and community participation.
SBM was intended to give schools broad authority to design, implement, and manage
their educational programs and classroom instruction in accordance to local social norms
and culture. The results framework appropriately mirrored the national level indicators
since the project was to contribute to the national program. The design team also decided



                                           6
to use a specific investment loan (SIL), utilizing IBRD funds, rather than a development
policy loan (DPL), because the loan was to finance a determined expenditure program in
the education sector and did not support a set of specific policy actions. As mentioned,
the risks were realistically identified, and mitigations strategies were developed with the
use of BEC-TF6 funds to ensure that the BOS-KITA development objectives would be
achieved. Since the project did not support specific policy actions, the loan was disbursed
based on quarterly Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) from the Ministry of Finance (MoF).
The design also limited project expenditures to categories identified in the BOS
Operations Manual 7 which was to be reviewed annually by the Bank for the
appropriateness of expenditures. In 2010, the project design was judged to be appropriate
and useful and the GoI requested an additional US$500 million to continue the BOS-
KITA. The project design remained the same with the exception of a few modifications
to the results framework.

19.     Quality at Entry. The BOS-KITA project underwent an extensive and thorough
Quality at Entry (QER) process. In June 2008, the Project Concept Note Review (PCN)
meeting endorsed: (i) the concept of a SIL as opposed to a DPL operation; and (ii) the use
of block grants as a mechanism to channel funds from the central government directly to
schools, but stressed that the team must provide greater detail of the controls which
would be in place for monitoring, evaluation and audit measures as well as eligible
expenses in the context of Bank disbursement requirements. The meeting also provided
the team with guidance to: (i) be more explicit in Bank documents as to the effectiveness
of the BOS program; (ii) emphasize the value added by the Bank, especially tied to the
Bank’s CPS and the implementation of BOS; (iii) develop an appropriate supervision
strategy for sampling the use of funds, linked to a robust assessment framework; (iv)
further develop anti-corruption measures; and (v) increase focus on fiduciary control
mechanisms, which needed to be in place for the project.

20.    In June 2008, the project underwent a quality enhancement review and the
following key points arose from the discussions to guide the preparation team as it
prepared for the Regional Operations Committee (ROC) meeting: (i) the BOS-KITA
project could be used to improve the outreach and socialization of the existing BOS
program by implementing a social marketing and information campaign; establishing an
independent monitoring unit; and strengthening SBM; and (ii) the project could look at
the Bank-supported National Program for Community Empowerment Project (PNPM)


6
  The BEC-TF supported extensive analytical and training activities directly related to such issues and
financial management at the district and school level, building on the exiting SMB system, and making
recommendations on the financing mechanisms available to central government in implementing the BOS
program.
7
  The BOS operations manual, issued by the MONE, details: (i) criteria for BOS school participation; (ii)
the list of BOS eligible expenditures; (iii) implementation arrangements at the BOS school, district,
province and central government levels; (iv) BOS grant agreement mechanisms; (v) financial reporting and
auditing requirements at each governmental levels; (vi) monitoring, supervision and reporting
requirements; (vii) complaints handling and sanctions, and (viii) information campaigns.

project that used a similar block grant mechanism with the support of some 7,000
facilitators at the field level and build on that model; (iii) IFRs for grants disbursed to
schools would be the basis for disbursements, thus IFRs needed to be certified; (iv) the
BOS Operations Manual and audit reports for the previous 3-4 years had been reviewed
by the FM team against the Central Operations Support Office framework and were
found to be working reasonably well although with room for improvement; and (v) the
BOS-KITA program should disburse based on documentation verifying the transfer of
grants to schools.

21.     In July 2008, the proposed project underwent a ROC which: (i) endorsed BOS-
KITA as central to the CPS and that BOS-KITA would operate in conjunction with BEC-
TF, focusing on improved service delivery and strengthened institutions; (ii) agreed that
the key question for support would be whether the Government was satisfactory in terms
of performance and fiduciary arrangements; and (iii) asked the team to revise the PAD to
included information on an effective financing mechanism for the BOS, the strengths and
weaknesses of BOS, justification on the basis and timing of Bank disbursements,
information on how school based management leads to reduction of corruption and
increased accountability, and ensure that the Risk Identification was focused and concise.

22.     The task team incorporated the majority of the recommendations from the three
reviews into the final PAD. Based on the findings present above, the ICR rates quality at
entry to be satisfactory.

2.2 Implementation

23.      Project implementation began with effectiveness on November 11, 2008. The
initial disbursements were made by the GoI and by December 2009 and 100 percent of
first year’s allocation had been disbursed. The BOS manual that had been reviewed and
approved during preparation was distributed to schools in February 2009. The DESP trust
fund provided support for the training on the manual for schools and stakeholders at all
levels which was conducted from March until April 2009. Subsequently, the BOS
operations manual was reviewed annually and the Bank and GoI made revisions when
appropriate to direct the implementation of the overall BOS program. 8 These annual
reviews of the manual were particularly important since the manual was and remains the
key element to the overall implementation of the BOS program and the chief opportunity
for the Bank to discuss related policy issues. (See Annex 2 for a full description of the
evolution of the project manual.) In February 2009, the first DESP trust fund-supported

  Examples of modifications to the BOS manual were: (i) guidelines that stipulated that school committees
must have a community representative on the school committee to ensure transparency and wider
community participation; (ii) the inclusion of earmarked funds specifically for “remedial teaching? rather
than lumping it together with sports, art and scouts; (iii) clarification of the sub-district roles, and the BOS
audit procedures; (iv) inclusion of an information gathering tool for the “safe schools? and refurbishment of
disaster retrofitted schools, an outgrowth of BEC-TF supported activities; and (v) instructions on how to
carry out budgeting and school improvement plans.

Regional Independent Monitoring (RIM) 9 survey took place in targeted locations that
assessed the school operational grant program. In November 2009, the Bank supported
the Government’s initiative to establish an inter-agency working group to fully discuss
key implementation issues under BOS and review how best to achieve the desired goal of
the education policies articulated within the BOS program. School based-management
was also moving forward. School committees were formed with parents and other local
community representatives in an effort to promote greater transparency. The school
committees were elected as required and they were being viewed as integral to the
management and oversight of schools. These committees provided inputs on school
educational policy and programs. They were also being trained on BOS procedures
alongside school staff and they approved annual budget plans. Schools were also
preparing school improvement plans that were reviewed and approved by the committees.
The BOS funds were received by schools and being managed with the involvement of a
board of teachers and community stakeholders10.

24.    On June 23, 2010 the Bank approved an US$500 million in Additional Financing.
The Bank and the GoI took the opportunity to increase the project’s focus on school
based management and increased management of BOS by local governments. 11
Additionally, the Bank and MoEC revised the BOS Operations Manual to clarify
allowable and unallowable expenditures, and capped the level of BOS funds that could be
used for honoraria at the school level at 20 percent. In 2011, MoEC, supported by the
World Bank, AusAID, ADB and other development partners, developed the “2011 BOS
Training Program? that was designed to provide school supervisors, school BOS teams,
and school committee members training on planning, managing and monitoring on the

   The RIM survey was designed to assess six important aspects of BOS: (i) funds allocation and
disbursement; (ii) funds utilization; (iii) transparency and information disclosure; (iv) monitoring and
complaint handling; (v) socialization; and (vi) school committee roles and functions. The RIM survey
process covered a total of 2,160 schools in four phases. Data gathered and reported by the RIM surveys,
because of its wide coverage and in depth information gathering methods, became a critical source of
useful monitoring data allowing for greater accuracy on measuring baseline values and subsequently
progress indicators for the project.

utilization of BOS funds in accordance with the BOS Operations Manual as well as
school self-evaluation, annual planning and budgeting. AusAID provided funds for the
roll-out of the training and the reproduction of the training materials and monitoring and
evaluation. This was an effort to train school management teams on the BOS processes as
well as socialize communities and schools to the overall BOS program and objectives.

25.     In 2011, implementation began to slow down. This was due to modifications that
the government made to the way that BOS funds were channeled. Originally, BOS funds
were channeled through a decentralized mechanism to education office at province level
and then transfered to schools as block grants. Beginning in 2011, BOS funds for public
schools became part of the district budget and subject to MoHA financial management
procedures and MoF mandated DIPA 12 line item budgeting thus curtailing the budget
flexibility inherent in block grants. BOS funds for private schools were in the form of a
block grant, managed by the District Finance Office (DFO). Funds for private schools
were channeled from the National Treasury (KUN) to the District Treasury (KUD) and
then to schools as block grant while funds to public schools were channeled from the
State Treasury to districts and then to schools. This change crearted confusion and by
February 2011, transfers of BOS funds slowed to the extent that only 22 percent of funds
had been distributed and 86 percent by March 30, 2011. This was a marked reduction in
the speed of distribution compared to the first two years of the project. In May 2011, the
Bank supervision mission downgraded financial management to moderately
unsatisfactory because of the delayed transfers and inability of districts and school staff
to use the unfamiliar MoHA financial procedures.

26.     In November 2011, after intensive reviews of: (i) the 2011 implementation; (ii)
the constraints faced by schools and districts; (iii) findings from RIM surveys/other
World Bank assessment results; (iv) inputs from Parliament; and (v) criticism from the
community and media, MoEC confirmed that the 2012 BOS funds distribution would
resume through the Provincial government using a block grant mechanism, for both
public and private schools. An inter-ministerial working group was established chaired by
BAPPANAS to put in place strategies to remedy the situation, provide further
clarification about BOS and to support its ongoing improvement. The 2012 BOS
guideline for the new system was signed by MoEC, MoF and MoHA in December 2011.
With this mechanism back in place, disbursements improved considerably, with 100
percent of 2012 first quarter funds disbursed by mid-January 2012. At this point, the
Bank raised the financial management rating to moderately satisfactory. The Bank’s
proactive involvement at this time was important in providing a rapid response analysis
of the issues on the funds flow and presenting options to the GoI on how these issues
might be resolved.

27.      The National Audit Bureau (Badan Pengawasan Keuangan dan Pembangunan -
BPKP) issued its 2011 BOS Audit Report based on analyzing data from 193 of the 497
districts and gave a qualified opinion, raising the concerns that: (i) implementation of
control systems at the district level showed weakness; and (ii) reliability of internal
control systems could not be fully verified. These findings reflected problems which
arose from the new procedures introduced in 2011 for the decentralization of BOS funds
disbursements. The BPKP audit made several recommendations dealing with the
allocation process, implementation, reporting and school fees. There were no reported
losses of funds by the audit.

28.    There were five Bank supervision mission from the period August 2009 through
October 2012. The makeup of the Bank’s teams was well balanced with financial
management staff well represented on missions (especially after the 2011 BOS audit
report was issued), along Implementation of the BOS-KITA project completed and all
US$1.1 billion was fully disbursed 8 months before project closing on December 31,
2012.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

29.     Design. The BOS M&E design included BOS management teams at the central,
provincial and district levels. The internal monitoring was meant to be a detailed
supervision process whereby teams also participated in resolving the problems they
uncovered. External monitoring was conducted by the MoEC’s research and development
agency, with a focus on evaluating program implementation, identifying systemic
weaknesses, and generating recommendations for improvement of the program. Through
the use of BEC-TF grant funds, the Bank provided technical assistance and capacity-
building support for data quality and management, and utilizing results in policy-making.
Integrity and reliability of government data was also a concern identified in the analysis
of BOS, and thus BOS-KITA included a third-party data quality audit conducted by
independent monitors with recommendations for improvement.

30.     The PDO level indicators for the BOS-KITA project were appropriately aligned
to the GoI’s goals for the national BOS program and the intermediate indicators were tied
to the project’s PDO goals of strengthening school-based management and community
participation, improving existing fiduciary arrangements for greater transparency and
accountability of the BOS program and improving the efficient utilization of BOS funds.
At the time of the Additional Financing in 2010, the PDO indicators remained the same
(except for indicator #5, as explained above) and additional intermediate indicators were
added in order to better gauge the achievement of project objectives at the school, school
committee, parent and community levels. Again, the intermediate indicators were linked
to project investments, and the data collection responsibilities clearly articulated.

31.    The independent third-party data quality review through independent monitors
was also an appropriate design element. In order to ensure objectivity and integrity of
information about the progress of the BOS-KITA project, a RIM system was set up. RIM
monitors conducted surveys at the district and school level and provided both the Bank



                                           11
and the government implementation teams with timely data. This survey was
complemented by analysis undertaken for by the World Bank on school based
management in primary schools.

32.     Implementation and Utilization of Monitoring and Evaluation. The
implementation of the BOS-KITA project was supported by the use of findings from the
annual SUSENAS surveys, triennial SUSENAS education modules, MoEC data, and
RIM and SMIC surveys. At the time of project design, it was agreed that the July round
of SUSENAS data would be used for measuring net enrollment rates at both primary and
junior secondary levels (PDO indicators 1 and 2). However, in mid-2012, it was
determined by the Bank, that the March round of SUSENAS data was the most reliable
source for measuring net enrollment rates over time. Therefore, the baseline values for
indicators 1 and 2 reported in the ICR come from the March round of SUSENAS.
Moreover, the associated end-of-project targets were derived by applying the same
calculation method originally used by the project preparation team to derive the end of
project targets using the July round of SUSENAS. This was done in order to ensure that
the results were comparable over time. PDO indicators 3 and 4 were not affected by the
Bank’s finding since these were sourced from MoEC’s Education Statistics in Brief
2008-2011. However, MoEC provided new end-target data for indicators 3 and 4 at the
time of the ICR, which are the ones being used for the analysis in this report. In addition,
the Bank’s findings did not impact Indicator 5 since it was sourced from the triennial
SUSENAS education module and, as mentioned previously, after the 2010 additional
financing, this indicator was no longer officially monitored because there were too many
exogenous factors that could impact its value.

33.     As mentioned above, intermediate indicators were tied to the project’s PDO goals
of strengthening school-based management and community participation, improving
existing fiduciary arrangements for greater transparency and accountability of the BOS
program and improving the efficient utilization of BOS funds. The sources for these
indicators were as follows: (i) intermediate indicators 1-8 were sourced from the RIM
survey; (ii) intermediate indicators 9, 13, and 14 were based on qualitative assessments
and/or field visits; and (iii) intermediate indicators 10-12 were sourced from the SMIC
survey. However, it should be noted that the baseline values for the intermediate
indicators 1-8 were not initially based on RIM survey since the first round of results were
not available at appraisal. Moreover, there were multiple sources of data (BPK,
BALITBAG, EQCPI base line study etc.), that were used to establish baselines and end-
of-project targets, some of which did not continue through project implementation.
Because of the multiple data sources used, there was no single methodology to derive
end-of-project targets for indicators 1-8. Once the RIM was available, the Bank team
relied on these data. The RIM data for 2008, 2009 and 2010 was appropriately weighted
in order to provide reliable, robust and comparable measures for assessment of the
indicators 1-8 over time for this. ICR analysis.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

34.    Safeguards. The BOS program did not finance civil works and procurement was
limited to small quantities of school consumable supplies and teaching and learning
materials purchased by the primary and junior secondary schools. Therefore, the BOS
program did not trigger any of the Bank’s safeguard policies and was classified as an
environmental category “C? project. No other safeguard policies were triggered.

35.     Fiduciary Compliance. As mentioned previously, MoEC was responsible for
implementing the project under the BOS-KITA project. The MoEC fiduciary
management capacity was satisfactory for the implementation of the original project and
the restructured project according to OP/BP 10.02. By project closing, there were no
outstanding Financial Management Reports (FMRs) and MoEC was fully compliant with
the submission of the quarterly interim financial reports (IFRs). As stated above, the 2011
BOS Audit Report gave a qualified opinion, raising issues about implementation of
control systems at the district level and financial report differences between MoF and
MoEC. However, there were no reported losses of funds. The BPKP audit made several
recommendations and MoEC followed up at the provincial and district levels. Based on
the audit findings and to mitigate similar challenges in the future, the GoI in 2012
changed the BOS funds transfer mechanism: instead of transferring funds from districts
to schools, they would be released from provincial levels directly to schools. The new
mechanism was spelled out in MoHA regulation No. 62/2011 (Permendagri No. 62/2011)
and “Guidelines of BOS management?. The final audit report is in the process of being
completed and is due by June 30, 2013. The limited project procurement was conducted
in accordance with Bank policies and procedures with no procurement issues raised
during implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

36.     The continuation of the national BOS program is a political and programmatic
priority of the GoI and MoEC. It seems highly likely that the financial portion of the BOS
program will continue given the GoI’s fiscal commitment of 20 percent of the
government budget focused on education. The GoI has asked that the Bank, on an
informal basis, to continue to work with the MoEC in the refinement of the BOS
Operations Manual which should mean that programmatic priorities developed during the
BOS-KITA project will be included in the ongoing BOS program. The BEC-TF ICR
reports that the district level Capacity Development Plans (CDPs) with their focus on
strengthening management at the district level contain within them budgets to continue
the CDP outline activities beyond the closing of the BEC-TF project.13 Although there is


13
  The overall objective of the BEC-TF program was to contribute to the Government of Indonesia’s (GoI)
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Education for All (EFA) goals through
good governance in education. Within this context, the BEC-TF sought to strengthen the planning,
budgeting, financial management and accountability at the local level in order to reduce leakages, increase
the efficiency of fund usage, and improve the delivery of education services. The BEC-TF project also



                                                   13
no next phase planned for Bank involvement in the BOS program, the Bank’s support
during the last four years of BOS operations has been substantial and the momentum in
the BOS program can be expected to be sustained over the medium term. The project
design of BOS-KITA which supported the GoI to strengthen financial management
procedures with transparency and accountability (e.g. eligible expenditures). These
features will enable the sustainability of project impacts.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

37.     Relevance of Objectives. The project objectives are highly relevant to the
Bank’s current pro-jobs engagement in the current CPS (FY13–15). The current CPS
supports the strengthening of the overall governance and management of the education
system to improve education quality and performance of teachers, and expects that these
activities will improve economic development results. The Government of Indonesia
continues to support the Five Year Medium Term Strategic Plan (RENSTRA) to promote
higher quality of management of primary and junior secondary education, and the BOS
program is central to carrying forward this national strategy. The GoI has taken steps to
sustain both financial and administrative arrangements in the BOS program central
financing mechanisms, and refinement of the guidelines and procedures for ensuring that
the quality, efficiency and efficacy of the intergovernmental transfer programs now
supporting both districts and schools. The project development objectives are appropriate
and are closely linked to Indonesia’s national education and MDG goals.

38.     Relevance of Design. The relevance of design is rated substantial. The design
with a single project component was in full alignment with the October 2003 CAS
framework of contributing to improving governance at the primary and junior secondary
education levels. The design of the project was to provide support to the existing
nationwide BOS program through on-budget transfers to reimburse government
expenditures in the BOS program of categories agreed to by the GoI and the Bank. The
project was also seen by the GoI as central in taking forward the reforms embedded in
their multi-year strategic plan (RENSTRA) which focused, among other aims, on
increasing the financial and budgetary capacity at the recently decentralized district and
school levels. The BOS program was and continues to be central to the GoI’s priorities in
providing increased access to quality primary and junior secondary age children and
achieving the MDG goals. The design used other donor trust funds to encourage
increased accountability at the local levels through strengthening school based



envisioned developing a sound monitoring and evaluation system capable of providing relevant data to
guide and inform the decision-making process across the entire education system.




                                                14
management and financial management activities as well as initiating a robust
independent monitoring survey system.

39.     Relevance of Implementation. Relevance of implementation is substantial. All
planned activities were completed and disbursements were at 100 percent eight months
before the project closed. However, there were challenges to overcome, including delays
caused by the modifications to the funds flow in 2011. This was rectified in 2012 with the
return to the Provincial block grant program which had been successful in the first two
years of the BOS-KITA project. The Provincial block grant mechanism appears to be
appropriate given the current level of decentralization and the capacity of districts to
manage the local education system.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

40.     Assessment of PDO Indicators. The PDO indicators show positive trends for
enrollment, dropout and transition rates. This is a substantial achievement because they
are reflective of the national goal of meeting the MDGs and are directly tied to the
project’s objectives. The intermediate indicators, which were strongly tied to project
interventions, also showed gains over the life of the project. Schools in all 497 BOS-
supported project districts show good progress in meeting the project development
objectives.

41.     The PDO Indicators. Progress toward achieving the PDOs was measured against
the following PDO indicators.14 The achievements are as follows: primary net enrollment
rates nationally increased from 91.13 percent in 2007 to 92.52 percent in 2012. The
disaggregated gender data associated with this indicator shows mixed results. Primary
female net enrollments surpassed the target by 0.45 percentage points while primary male
net enrollment rates missed the target by 0.11. Primary net enrollment rates for the
poorest quintile increased from 90.93 percent in 2007 to 92.52 percent in 2012 missing
the target by 1.73 percentage points. Despite missing the end-of-project target, the
increase in net enrollments for the poorest quintile, shows that the government has made
progress in reaching the disadvantaged regions of the country and is judged to be
significant given that these are the hardest to reach areas.

42.    Junior Secondary net enrollment rates increased nationally from 66.47 percent in
2007 to 69.96 percent in 2012. The increases in net enrollment rates at the junior
secondary level were particularly large within the poorest income quintile rising from
53.03 percent in 2007 to 63.54 percent in 2012. These gains reflect the BOS program’s
success in expanding access to poor and disadvantaged children. Significant net
enrollment gains at the junior secondary level among both males (rising from 64.37
percent to 68.09 percent) and females (rising from 68.68 percent to 71.95 percent) were
also observed over the 2007-12 period.


14
 As mentioned, indicator 5 was not monitored because there were too many factors affecting the average
monthly expenditure per child on education that were outside the control of the project.



                                                 15
43.     Reductions in dropout rates and improvements in transition rates are also
observed over the 2007-11 period. Dropout Rates: At the primary school level dropout
rates decreased from 2.37 percent to 1.61 percent and at the junior secondary school level
dropout rates fell from 2.88 percent to 1.80. Transition Rates: Transition rates from
primary to junior secondary school also increased from 75.58 percent in 2008 to 77.26
percent in 2011. This fell short of the end-of-project target of 82.20 percent but is a
positive trend nonetheless. Transition rates from junior secondary to senior secondary
school also increased from 89.20 percent in 2008 to 97.93 percent in 2010, exceeding the
end-of-project target of 97.39 percent.

44.     Intermediate Outcome Indicators. The intermediate level indicators were
closely aligned to the BOS-KITA scope and activities and in several cases the positive
trends demonstrated the impact that modifications in the BOS Operations Manual made
on project implementation. 15 These indicators showed significant gains throughout
project implementation. The intermediate indicators are clustered under three topics and
are discussed below based on the cluster design.

45.      Cluster No. 1 Improved Management of BOS Funds included seven indicators:
      a. On time arrival of funds at schools. The percent of schools receiving funds on
          time significantly increased from 47.05 percent in 2008 to 79.93 percent in 2010.
          As reported earlier, in 2011, the MoF changed the funds flow mechanism to give
          direct payments to the districts which slowed down disbursements to schools.
          While RIM data has been published beyond 2010 for this indicator, MOEC
          reports that by 2012 the flow of funds issue had been resolved and schools are
          now receiving funds in a timely fashion.
      b. Percentage of schools receiving full allocation of funds based on student
          numbers. The data for this indicator shows an increase from 85.55 percent in
          2008 to 93.11 percent in 2010. This is a sizable increase in the numbers of
          schools with accurate student-based allocations. Accuracy of funds allocation is
          also highlighted in the 2009 study by MoEC that indicates 93.5 percent of funds
          allocated in the period of July – December 2007 and January – June 2008
          matched the actual number of students. This is an improvement compared to a
          previous MoEC study in 2006 that highlights an accuracy rate of 84.5 percent.
          Accuracy of funds allocation with student numbers also received a high score in
          the BPKP audit report with a score of 97.0 percent.
      c. Percentage of school committees which approve budget plans. This indicator
          showed an increase from 2.81 percent in 2008 to 72.93 percent in 2010.
          Preliminary findings from the RIM survey conducted in 2011 suggests that most
          school committees participate in the planning and budgeting decisions at the
          school level, particularly those related to BOS. Early results indicate that the


15
  The data sources used for the intermediate indicators are: (i) RIM for indicators 1-8; (ii) qualitative
assessment and/or field visits for indicators 9, 13 and 14; and (iii) SMIC survey data for indicators 10-12.
MoEC is reported in this section in order to provide additional evidence of the project’s achievements.



                                                    16
          proportion of primary school committees that participated in the school budget
          process increased from 67 percent in 2008 to 90 percent in 2011.16 This is a
          considerable achievement over the life of the project and is judged to be
          successful. Again, this is a reflection of the emphasis in increasing accountability
          and transparency at the local level, a hallmark of the SBM elements in the
          project. An additional aspect related to this indicator is that in 2010 the BOS
          operations manual was revised to require school committees to include an
          individual from the community as a committee member, another effort at
          increasing transparency and community involvement.
     d.   Percent of school committees that review and approve expenditure reports. This
          indicator was first included in 2010 and the RIM data shows that, as of 2010,
          35.83 percent of the school committees review and approve expenditure reports.
          MoEC data, which reports on a smaller sample, indicates that by 2012, 87
          percent of the committees reviewed the reports. Again, this review and approval
          activity was the result of revisions made in the BOS operations manual. The
          revisions to the 2009 Operations Manual strengthened financial disclosure and
          reporting requirements by mandating that school committees play a more active
          role in the approval of school expenditures.
     e.   Percentage of schools which have a school improvement plan increased from
          41.59 percent in 2009 to 62.99 percent in 2010. This 20 percentage point
          increase shows considerable progress with the use of SIPs. School based
          management reforms were significantly strengthened when BOS grants were
          introduced. Grants under the program provided a predictable and reliable source
          of funding that could be used in ways that the school itself thought best to
          improve education outcomes. To support these improvements, the program
          required schools to develop 4 year development plans and translate these into
          annual work plans and budgets. The BOS program assigned a central role to
          school committees in the management and use of school grants. At each step of
          the process, school committees were required to participate in school planning
          and provide oversight on expenditure plans and reports.17
     f.   Percentage of schools that have relevant procurement plans. A specific
          numerical baseline and end-of-project target was never established for this
          indicator. Project documentation indicates that it was expected to increase
          continuously over the life of the project. The 2011 achievement of 65.66 percent
          (RIM data) and the reported 71 percent value reported by the MoEC are an
          indication of the adoption of this instruction which appears in the BOS
          Operations Manual. Again, this is an indication of increased management
          capacity developed at school levels.
     g.   Percentage of schools with BOS expenditures by category displayed on notice
          boards increased from 30.06 percent in 2009 to 34.01 percent in 2010. Although
          the gains are modest, schools have increasingly displayed their BOS

         expenditures on their notice boards. This indicator is important for the
         transparency of the school-based financial management process. The 2007 BOS
         Operations Manual stipulated that schools were obligated to post budget plans
         and report on BOS funds received on school notice board, but not the actual use
         of funds. The 2009 BOS Operation Manual additionally mandated that schools
         post records of purchasing information and use of funds on school notice boards.

46.     Cluster No. 2 Increased Public Information and Dissemination regarding
BOS was supported by the comprehensive Social Marketing and Information Campaign
funded under DESP which included national public service announcements, district
events, school interventions and media relation activities all focused on improving the
accountability of the BOS program. This important initiative applies to all three
indicators in this Cluster # 2:
     a. Number and type of socialization materials distributed. A specific numerical
         baseline and end-of-project target was never established for this indicator.
         However, the team was able to determine that18 BOS posters and pocket books
         were distributed to every MoEC school in Indonesia and local district and
         provincial levels media, indicating proactivity on the part of the government to
         conduct a socialization campaign.
     b. Percentage of parents who know the unit costs of BOS. This was a new indicator
         that was added at the time of the Additional Financing in 2010. The percentage
         of parents with knowledge of the unit costs of BOS increased from 4.4 percent to
         8.2 percent, missing the end-of-project target of 20 percent. This target was not
         met indicating that the school based management process, which depends on a
         good level of active parent participation to be effective, still needs more work.
     c. Percentage of parents who know the objectives of BOS. The data provided for
         this indicator shows that 57.8 percent know the objectives of BOS. This
         exceeded the target of 52 percent. While this was a positive development the
         MoEC continued to promote increased parent’s knowledge of the BOS program.
         In 2012 MoEC launched another socialization campaign and provided districts
         with posters containing the following information: (i) objectives of the BOS
         program; (ii) the amount of BOS received by all schools; (iii) unit costs for
         students at the primary and junior secondary levels of education; and (iv)
         description of the roles and responsibilities of school committees and parents as
         they relate to the effective implementation of the BOS program.




18
   BOS socialization materials were distributed in the following manner: 2009—Leaflets; posters;
calendars; BOS discussions in the magazine PELANGI; BOS manual distributed to journalists; NGOs;
local parliamentarians; and publication in provincial newspapers of BOS allocations per school. 2010—
BOS posters to every district; BOS manual; and publication in the province newspaper of BOS allocations
per school. 2011—BOS leaflet and calendar to every school and BOS manual. 2012—4 BOS posters;
pocket books to every school; briefs released during national media events; BOS manual; and BOS relevant
information available on the BOS dedicated and secure MoEC website: www.bos.kemdikbud.go.id.



                                                  18
47.      Cluster No. 3. Improved Monitoring and Evaluation included two indicators:
      a. Annual consolidated reports produced as a result of MIS improvement. This
          indicator was met. In 2012 systems were introduced in all schools that
          systematically collect student data. TRIMS and improved complaints handling
          are also being used in school as of 2012. Modifications in reporting systems and
          formats were introduced in the revised 2011 BOS project manual.
      b. Final process evaluation and special studies undertaken, SBM study completed,
          SMIC activities and survey completed. Achievement of this indicator is judged to
          have been met. The SMIC and SBM reports were completed and an overall BOS
          evaluation was underway in March 2013.

48.     As the intermediate indicators illustrate, the BOS Operations Manual, and the
Bank’s role in assisting in updating and approving the final results of any modifications,
was of substantial significance in taking forward the project’s PDOs related to school-
based management and community participation as well as improving the existing
fiduciary arrangements at the school and district levels. 19 Greater transparency and
accountability were also taken forward by improvements in financial management and
budgeting. The monitoring of all indicators through the manual were tied to PDO values.
As mentioned, the Bank’s role in reviewing and approving the BOS Operations Manual
through discussions with the government was of singular importance in the initial design,
its implementation, and assessing the eventual success of the project and its PDOs.

3.3 Efficiency

49.     Positive Trends in Key Education Indicators and Internal Efficiency Gains.
The BOS national program—which received on-budget support from the Bank’s BOS-
KITA project and capacity building and technical assistance from the DESP and the
BEC-TF program—has contributed to the positive gains observed within the education
sector between 2007 and 2012. Net and gross enrollment rates at the primary and junior
secondary levels of education increased during this period. The increases in net
enrollment rates at the junior secondary level are particularly large within the poorest
income quintile (rising from 53.03 percent in 2007 to 63.54 percent in 2012). Internal
efficiency gains have also been observed over this period, evidenced by: (i) increased
completion rates at the primary and junior secondary levels; (ii) increased transition rates
from primary school to junior secondary school; (iii) reduced drop-out rates at the



19
  The revisions introduced to the BOS Operations Manual in 2009 strengthened community oversight over
the usage of BOS funds by expanding the membership of the of school management teams by including a
parent representative. Prior to these updates only principals, treasurers and teachers were allowed to be
members of the school committee team. The revisions to the Operations Manual also strengthened financial
disclosure and reporting requirements by mandating that schools post the amount of BOS funds received
and spent, eligible and ineligible expenditures, procurement plan and procurement activities on their school
notice boards. Prior to 2009, schools were only required to post budget plans and record the amount of
BOS funds received on their notice boards—not the actual executed expenditures. These new guidelines
were introduced in order to increase the transparency in the use of funds at the school level.



                                                    19
primary and junior secondary levels; and (iv) reduced repetition rates at the primary and
junior secondary levels.

50.     Returns to Education. The BOS program, supported through the BOS-KITA
project, continues to generate important economic gains; both private returns to
individuals and public gains to Indonesian society. Because of BOS/BOS-KITA, children
are able to attend school and pursue their education to higher levels of schooling. Using
survey data on individual characteristics—including highest degree obtained and labor
earnings—private returns to education are estimated by comparing an individuals’
expected wage across the various levels of education. The updated analysis reveals that
there is a strong positive relationship between an individuals’ level of schooling and their
expected yearly income. The total and marginal returns to primary and secondary school
remain high within the Indonesian labor market, providing a strong economic
justification for the GoI’s public investment in basic education.

51.     Private Gains from Increased Enrollment at the Junior Secondary level.
Increased net enrollment rates at junior secondary levels have also been observed since
the launch of the BOS-KITA project.20 The private gains resulting from such an increase
are estimated by contrasting the Net Present Value (NPV) of the direct and indirect costs
borne by individuals who complete three additional years of education, to the benefits in
terms of increased expected earnings for all the additional students who make the
transition to the junior secondary level. The updated analysis reveals that the private
gains associated with making the transition from primary to junior secondary school are
substantial. A 1 percent increase in enrollment at the junior secondary level is projected
to generate an aggregate net private gain of approximately US$12.45 million.

52.     Savings from Reduced Repetition Rates at the Primary and Junior
Secondary levels. The main channel through which the BOS program and the BOS-
KITA project have contributed to decreasing repetition rates at the primary and junior
secondary levels is by increasing the quality and relevance of teaching and learning at the
school level and by providing targeted support to students from the poorest income
quintile—those who typically are more likely to repeat or drop out of school. Using the
latest available data on the public and private cost of providing schooling to each pupil
per year, it is possible to estimate the avoided cost to the education system and to
Indonesian households from decreasing repetition rates. The updated analysis reveals that
a decrease in repetition rates by 1 percent is estimated to generate public and private
savings of US$132.51 million at the primary level and US$66.45 million at the junior
secondary level.




20
   Official MoEC data also shows that transition rates from primary to junior secondary school have
increased from 75.58 percent in 2008 to 77.26 percent in 2011.




                                                20
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

53.     The objective and project design were highly relevant in that they fit squarely into
the government’s multi-year strategic plan program. The relevance of implementation is
judged to be substantial because all the funds were disbursed and the Bank and
government worked effectively to resolve the delays in transfer of funds to schools. The
efficiency of the project was substantial because the BOS program and the BOS-KITA
project continued to generate important economic gains; both private returns to
individuals and public gains to Indonesia society. Moreover, lower levels of financial
leakage within the education system are observed as a result of the GoI’s overall efforts
at strengthening external and internal audit systems as well as the BOS-KITA increased
focus on improving financial management, transparency and accountability at the local
level. However, the 2011 problematic disbursement process led to delays in the delivery
of funds to schools and the BPKP 2012 national audit which found weaknesses in the
financial management mechanism results in an overall rating of moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

54.     (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development. The project,
with its focus on net enrollment and transition rates differentiated by gender, provides
evidence that girls’ enrollment rates at the primary and junior secondary levels increased
during the project, surpassing the project targets. Net enrollments and the junior
secondary level increased between 2007 and 2012 especially among the poorest income
quintile, rising from 53.03 percent to 63.54 percent. In addition, the BOS national
program has also provided transportation subsidies for poor students to ensure that these
pupils attend school and complete their academic studies. In 2012, the MoEC reported
there was a large increase in the BOS per-student allocation which reduced the fees/costs
of education, because BOS manual revisions in 2012 included provision to use BOS
funds for the purchase of uniforms, shoes and stationery for poor students.

55.      (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening. The ongoing process of revising the BOS
project manual, a process in which the Bank played a role, is illustrative of a major
institutional change supported by the BOS-KITA project. (See Annex 2 for details.) How
BOS grants are to be distributed, spent and reported as stipulated in the project manual
guides the entire national BOS program. The GoI has asked for continuing Bank
involvement in this process after the completion of the BOS-KITA project

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Modest

56.     The risk to development outcomes at project closing is rated moderate given the
GoI’s political commitment to increased budgets for education and continuing fiscal
commitment to fund the BOS program. As part of the GoI’s decentralization and
democratization process, the BOS program is one of the GoI’s primary institutional
supports for such efforts, and it is unlikely that the government’s support for the BOS
program will diminish over the medium run. The allocation of 20 percent of the central
government budget to education from 2009 onwards and the substantial increase in
education resources that resulted from this policy change have significantly strengthened
the financial sustainability of the BOS national program post BOS-KITA project. The
ICR’s financial analysis reveals the program is sustainable even under a model simulation
which assumes high enrollment growth and high projected BOS unit cost increases post-
2012. This bodes well moving forward. Indonesia seems to be politically and financially
committed to continuing the BOS program.

57.    The GoI’s request that the Bank remain involved in the improvement of the 2013
BOS operations manual even after the closing of the project is a positive indicator of the
usefulness of the Bank’s involvement in this critical activity and reflects the GoI’s
continual requests for the Bank’s analytical and rapid response capability. The
development of such tools as the BOS Complaints Handling system, TRIMS and
SupportMySchool 21 have provided local schools and communities with increased
capacity to monitor and evaluate the quality of efficiency of school development
programs. Such involvement, whether by parents or community leaders, is important in
assuring transparency and accountability at the school level.

58.   The risk assessment and rating undertaken during preparation and the mitigation
measures were realistic. Some of the risks were rated as moderate (BOS, a central
government program, might weaken the efforts for decentralization) turned out to be


21
   Tools developed include: (i) the BOS Complaint Handling System supports the Law 14/2008 on Public
Information and the implementation of Indonesia’s Open Government Action Plan 2012 within MoEC’s
goals of promoting transparency, participation and accountability in the implementation of the BOS
program. Complaint handling relies on community participation to provide feedback from beneficiaries in
the field (community, schools, districts, and provinces, central). It is also a mechanism to support
transparency and participation in education service delivery and effective/efficient governance. (ii) TRIMS
is an evidence-based education policy instrument, introduced to all schools nationally in 2011 as part of
education management information systems reforms to support reliable and timely data collection and
reporting.(iii) SupportMySchool is an online reporting system that allows members of the public and the
school/university community, as well as local government and MoEC personnel, to report on critical needs
within schools and universities, so that these needs can be systematically recorded and resolved by the
education system.

negligible during implementation. Others rated substantial (misuse of funds at the school
levels, M&E efforts might be slow in being developed, audit coverage may be less than
adequate and procurement structures and procedures might not be properly in place)
accurately depicted potential risk areas and warranted continuing close scrutiny during
the project. Through the 2009 and 2011 BOS Training, a national government initiative,
capacity development programs took place and the project equipped districts with
increased financial management and reporting skills. These capacity building activities,
as well as the continuing scrutiny of the GoI’s audit agencies, have lessened the reported
leakage of national level funds at the local levels (See Annex 3). These capacity
development activities, supported by both GoI’s funds as well as the BEC-TF project,
provide mitigating actions which have lessened the financial risks identified during
project preparation.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

59.     Bank performance at entry is judged to be satisfactory. The Bank preparation
team worked effectively with the GoI and particularly MoEC in the development of the
project. Extensive time was devoted to tailoring project activities around the existing
BOS national program. The Bank team worked with the GoI in revising the BOS
operations manual, a Loan Agreement compliance requirement, which set the parameters
of how the BOS program was to be managed at the provincial, district and school levels,
defining the categories within which BOS funds could be spent at the school level, and
the mechanisms that school principals and school committees were to use to manage and
report on the use of BOS funds. There was an extensive quality review process for the
project and the thorough preparation process made it possible for the government to
satisfactorily comply with the conditions of effectiveness within a short period.

60.    Two task team leaders were responsible for the entire project preparation cycle
and one of them continued her responsibility into the implementation process thus
providing continuity to the timely implementation and completion of all the key project
preparation activities that were required. Considerable time was spent by the task team in
discussions with the government in an effort to ensure agreement on the strategic goals of
the GoI as well as the CAS goals and project development policies of the Bank.

(b) Quality of Supervision

61.     The Bank task team provided strong continuous leadership for the project,
particularly in the discussions with MoEC, BAPPENAS and the MoF related to: (i) the
improvement of the BOS Operations Manual, (ii) the potential impact of the 2011
changes in the funds flow policies and their return back to the Provincial Block Grant
mechanism in 2012, (iii) the analysis of project progress as evidenced in the use of RIM
data, (iv) the development of the 2009 and 2011 BOS Training, (v) the use of BEC-TF
and DESP funds to support some of the BOS program activities, and DESP funds to
improve the BOS Complaints Handling system, Monitoring and Evaluation system,



                                           23
SMIC, as well as the implementation of a SBM study, and (vi) resolving issues raised by
the 2011 BOS Audit.

62.     Through intensive communication, meetings, attending & participating in BOS
national coordination meetings, the Jakarta based task team kept in constant contact with
the project implementing agency. This approach contributed significantly to the
collaboration between the Bank and the GoI team, in addition to formal supervisions.
Mission findings were related to the GoI and Bank management in a timely manner and
the task team followed up on their recommendations. The Jakarta-based staff was critical
in following up on compliance with agreed tasks between missions. The Bank’s
supervision missions were instrumental in working with the GoI and MoEC to resolve
financial management issues raised by the BOS 2011 Audit.

63.     The Bank consistently monitored the results framework using various sources of
data to report year over year project progress. The main challenge at the PDO level
stemmed from the fact that the July round of SUSENAS was not the most robust source
to measure net enrollment rates over time. Another challenge resulted from the fact that
there were multiple data sources used to calculate the intermediate indicators 1-8
baselines and end of project targets. Moreover, it was determined by the Bank team, after
project closing, that these indicators had not been properly weighted/calculated during
project implementation. However, at the time of the ICR review this issue was rectified
with the recalculation of RIM data thereby providing the needed information to measure
project achievements. For this reason, this ICR rates quality of Bank supervision as
moderately satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Based on the findings above, including the challenges of data sources and use, the Bank
performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a)Government Performance: moderately satisfactory

64.     The GoI was fully committed to implementing and financing the BOS program
throughout the BOS-KITA project, and was responsive to recommendations in relation to
revisions of the BOS Operations Manual. The GoI’s return in 2012 to the Provincial
Block Grant funds flow system for the BOS program demonstrated a quick and positive
response to a problem that had delayed disbursements in 2011. An Inter-Ministerial
Working Group was established to put in place strategies to remedy the situation, provide
further clarification about BOS and to support its ongoing improvement. The BPKP also
undertook an annual audit of the BOS which was important for ensuring the appropriate
financial management of the project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

65.   The GoI’s implementing agency of the BOS-KITA project for the first two years
was the Directorate General for Management of Basic Education (DGMBE). The


                                           24
implementation unit for the last 2 years was the Directorate General of Primary and
Secondary Education (DSGPSE). The implementation unit that worked directly with the
Bank team most often was the Central Project Implementation Unit (CPIU). CPIU’s role
focused on coordination, facilitation, mentoring and problem solving, evaluation and
reporting, and, coordination between line ministries and the Bank, provinces and districts.
Facilitation included the development, along with the Bank, of changes of the BOS
Project Manual, verification of documents, disbursement of grants and preparation of
reports. CPIU also conducted monitoring and evaluation activities up to 1-3 times each
year using improved monitoring instruments, established and institutionalized in the BOS
Complaints Handling system, and conducted national BOS campaigns as a continuation
of the SMIC activities funded by DESP. MoEC as the implementing agency, and more
specifically the CPIU, worked diligently to try to find a solution to the 2011 days in the
flow of funds to schools, and assisted the Inter-Ministerial Working Group in its work on
this subject. The CPIU carried off these tasks well and were able to maintain project
implementation momentum in the face of bureaucratic hurdles placed in front of them.
Based on this analysis the performance of implementing agency is rated moderately
satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Based on the findings above, overall Borrower performance is rated moderately
satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

66.     Lesson 1. Good and reliable data are essential for monitoring and evaluating
new approaches to the delivery of education services. The BOS-KITA project design
included the RIM survey (financed by the DESP trust fund) to be able to monitor the
impact of the government’s decentralization process which was an excellent design
feature. However, the project would have benefitted by receiving the DESP funds prior to
implementation so that a RIM baseline survey could have been conducted prior to
implementation. This would have provided a robust data set for ongoing project
monitoring and evaluation. Results must also be synchronized with the end-of the project
so that achievements are measured with the most up-to-date information.

67.     Lesson 2. The efficient and timely BOS disbursements to schools are
contingent upon establishing and maintaining a clear funds flow mechanism. The
BOS program suffered substantial delays because of a changing in the funds flow
mechanism, depending on institutions and staff members who were ill-prepared for their
responsibilities; poorly formulated decisions from central government; conflicting
regulations (MoEC vs. MoHA); districts and schools were not prepared with the
necessary skills and capacity to develop the very detailed and inflexible annual budgets.
Adequate capacity building at both institutional and staff levels, is critical if major shifts
are to be made in how money flows from the center to local levels in a major national
program such as BOS.




                                             25
68.    Lesson 3. On-budget Bank support for a government program allows
leveraging limited Bank financing into overarching national sector investments.
Bank technical assistance and guidance on the BOS Operations Manual had greatest
impact on improved existing fiduciary arrangements, funds flow, school-based
management and increased community participation in BOS activities throughout
Indonesia.

Annex 2: Outputs by Component.

1.     The Project Development Objective (PDO) of BOS-KITA is “to improve access
to quality education in Indonesia for all children ages 7 to 15 by strengthening school-
based management (SBM) and community participation, improving existing fiduciary
arrangements for greater transparency and accountability of the BOS program and,
consequently, bringing about the better use of BOS funds?.

2.      In addition to the School Operational Grants program (BOS), the Government of
Indonesia (GoI) is conducting a range of other initiatives which contribute to its goal of
access and universal basic education for the poor and the lowering of education costs
generally. These include: Local Government subsidies to supplement BOS; strategies to
reach out-of-school children (District, School, Community); new school construction;
special funding allocations (Dana Alokasi Khusus – DARK) for: new classrooms and
classroom rehabilitation, equipment for teaching and learning, and library books;
scholarships programs for the poor; pre and in-service teacher competency development
and training, through Teacher Working Groups (Kelompok Kerja Guru – KKG;
Musyawarah Guru Mata Pelajaran – MGMP) to address learning issues of students at
risk ‟ and help them progress through the education system?.

3.     Under the BOS-KITA project, grant funding has been facilitated through the
DESP and the Basic Education Capacity Building (BEC) Trust Funds. The grants
provided technical advice and capacity building support for policy analysis to strengthen
school based management (SBM), financial management, transparency and
accountability and fiduciary arrangements.

4.     Complementary Development Partner projects are also supporting the BOS
program: AusAID and European Union: Education Sector Support Program’s Principal
and Supervisor Competency Development; AUD 26 million grant to support the 2011-
2012 nation-wide School BOS Management Team training and evaluation, as part of the
nationwide system of professional development program for principals and supervisors;
UNICEF’s support to MoEC’s School Based Management Secretariat; Asian
Development Bank’s Minimum Service Standards project and support to the 2011- 2012
nation-wide School BOS Management Team training; and USAID’s Decentralized Basic
Education project: Technical advisory support in the design of the 2011- 2012 nation-
wide School BOS Management Team training.

5.    The BOS-KITA project provided direct budgetary support to the Indonesian
Government’s (GoI) Bantuan Operasional Sekolah (BOS) national program. The BOS-
KITA loan reimbursed a portion of the GoI’s BOS expenditures and was designed to
improve access to quality education by strengthening school-based management and
community participation by improving existing fiduciary arrangements for greater
transparency and accountability. This was to be achieved through direct financial
support to the ongoing BOS national program and through revisions and updates to the
BOS Operations Manual. The Bank’s funds were made available to the GoI based on the




                                           28
government’s compliance with the mutually agreed upon criteria stipulated in the BOS
Operations Manual.

The types of changes made to the BOS manual between 2009 and 2012 based on the
requirements of the Bank were as follows:

6.    Changes in the BOS Manual 2009 were: (i) obligating school to also post the
use of BOS funds on school notice boards; (ii) including Bank’s Anti-Corruption
Guidelines; (iii) providing simple guidelines on procurement of goods, including the
need for a procurement team consisting of three persons, at least one of whom is a
parent representative from the local community; (iv) signing-off expenditure reports by
school committees ; and (v) adding an online platform to promote information flows on
school conditions and resolve complaints.

7.    Changes in the BOS Manual 2010 were: (i) obligating schools to post records of
purchasing information and use of BOS funds on school notice boards; (ii) including a
community member is the BOS school committee; (iii) reviewing expenditure reports by
school committees; and (iv) developing minutes of school budget plan (RKAS)
development meetings.

8.     Changes in the BOS Manual 2011 were: (i) limiting honoraria expenditures to
20 percent; (ii) instituting guidelines to hire teachers along student: teacher ratios (as
stated in the Regulation of the Minister of National Education No. 15 Year 2010 on
Minimum Service Standards for Primary Education at the Regency/City Level); and (iii)
increasing focus on the role of the School Committee with regard to the school plan,
school reports and expenditure.

9.     Changes in BOS Manual 2012 were: (i) including active and creative learning
activities for improving the quality education as an eligible expenditure; (ii) including
mobile internet access as an eligible expenditure; (iii) including purchase of electricity
power, besides generator sets, as an eligible expenditure; (iv) including student desks
and chairs as an eligible expenditure, if the existing ones are severely damaged; and (v)
informing students’ parents in writing about BOS funds receipts and uses each semester.

                                                            information suggests that the on-time release of

                                                            improved. Therefore, an overall improvement in

School Based Management - SBM
Important to the implementation of the BOS-KITA was its support of school based management (SBM)
in all BOS supported school. In 2003, the Indonesian government began to decentralize the governance
of its primary and secondary education system as part of its decentralization of responsibilities to district
governments in order to strengthen the country’s democratization processes. Schools were given
authority to manage their operations independently according to student needs and were asked to engage
the local community to improve the quality of education. This decentralized form of school management
became known as “SBM?, and required a major shift in how people thought about schooling and
improvements in the capacity of principals, teachers, and the community to provide leadership, develop
programmatic alternatives to meet local educational needs, and engage parents and the community in the
governance of schools. The Indonesian version of SBM was intended to give schools broad authority to
design, implement, and manage their educational programs and classroom instruction in accordance to

local social norms and culture. However, ultimate authority of hiring civil service teachers (pegawai
negeri sipil - PNS) remains with the central government. Although operational authority was devolved to
schools, schools were mandated to establishing SCs whose functions included giving input on school
educational policy and programs, budget plans, and teacher training; increasing society’s attention and
commitment to quality education; motivating parents to participate in the children’s education; collecting
money in support of education; and supervising education policy and program implementation. To
promote transparency, SC members were to be elected and broadly representative of the community.

                                                     improvements, the program required schools to

                                                       The BOS program assigned a central role to SCs
                                                       in the management and use of school grants. At
                                                       each step of the process, SCs were required to

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      The BOS-KITA project provided direct on-budget support to the BOS program.
The economic and financial analysis of the BOS-KITA project is therefore situated
within the broader context of the BOS national program.23. The BOS program and the
BOS-KITA project continue to generate important economic gains; both private returns
to individuals and public gains to Indonesian society. The first source of these gains is
through increasing the lifetime earnings of those children who, because of BOS/BOS-
KITA, pursue their education to higher levels of schooling. Using the latest available data,
the Net Present Value (NPV) of private gains continues to exceed the direct and indirect
costs of basic education. Additional benefits include public and private savings from
reduced repetition rates at the primary and junior secondary level and reduced financial
leakage due to improved financial management, transparency and accountability at the
local level. An updated analysis also indicates that the BOS national program is projected
to be financially sustainable after the end of the BOS-KITA project.

2.      Positive Trends in Key Education Indicators and Internal Efficiency Gains.
The BOS national program has contributed to the positive gains observed within the
education sector between 2007 and 2012. As Table 1 illustrates, net and gross enrollment
rates at the primary and junior secondary levels of education increased between 2007 and
2012. The increases in net enrollment rates at the junior secondary level are particularly
large within the poorest income quintile (rising from 53.03 percent in 2007 to 63.54
percent in 2012). Internal efficiency gains have also been observed over the 2007 to 2012
period, evidenced by: (i) increased completion rates at the primary and junior secondary
levels; (ii) increased transition rates from primary school to junior secondary school; (iii)
reduced drop-out rates at the primary and junior secondary levels; and (iv) reduced
repetition rates at the primary and junior secondary levels.




23
   Since the BOS-KITA project reimbursed a portion of the Government of Indonesia’s (GoI) BOS national
program, no disaggregated data specific to the BOS-KITA project is publicly available. The economic and
financial analysis provided by the ICR team must therefore be carried out in relation to the GoI’s national
BOS program.

Quantifying the Economic Value of the BOS National Program/BOS-KITA Project

3.      Returns to Education. The BOS national program and the BOS-KITA project
have provided schools with the financial resources needed to cover non-salary
operational expenses 24 . The increased operational budgets at the school level and the
targeted financial support to poor students have increased supply and demand for basic
education in Indonesia. The BOS national program and BOS-KITA project continue to
generate significant private returns to individuals who purse their education to higher
levels of schooling. Using survey data on individual characteristics—including highest
degree obtained and labor earnings—private returns to education are estimated by
comparing an individuals’ expected wage across the various levels of education. As
Table 2 illustrates, there is a strong positive relationship between an individuals’ level of
schooling and their expected yearly income. The total and marginal returns to primary
and secondary school remain high within the Indonesian labor market, providing a strong
economic justification for the GoI’s public investment in basic education.25. Furthermore,
in the absence of the GoI’s investment in education through the BOS national program,
Indonesian society as a whole may under-invest in basic education, not only because the
poorest households face financial constraints but also because private investment
decisions fail to take into account the social returns and externalities of basic education.



24
  As of 2012, Indonesia’s Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC) estimates that BOS funds represent
approximately 80 percent of non-salary operational resources at the school level.




                                                                  37
While the latter benefits are difficult to quantify in monetary terms, they further highlight
the relevance and importance of the BOS national program/BOS-KITA project.

Source and notes: World Bank staff calculations based on Sakernas 2010. The base (reference) education
level used in the regression model was defined as “less than completed primary.? The adjusted yearly wage
figures were derived by multiplying the average yearly wage for “no education? by the estimated earnings
coefficients within each level of education (primary, junior secondary, senior secondary, and tertiary). As
such, the adjusted yearly wage figures represent the share of wage which is determined exclusively by the
level of educational attainment. The total returns are then calculated in relation to “no education?, while the
marginal gain reflects the expected benefit from completing each additional level of education.

4.      Private Gains from Increased Enrollment at the Junior Secondary level.
Increased net enrollment rates at the primary and junior secondary levels have been
observed since the launch of the BOS-KITA project. Official MoEC data also shows that
transition rates from primary to junior secondary school have increased from 75.58
percent in 2007 to 77. 26 percent in 2011 (up by 1.68 percentage points). Since it is
difficult to partial out the relative impact of the BOS program/BOS-KITA project on
sector-wide outcomes with a high level of precision, private gains from increased
enrollment at the junior secondary level are estimated under two scenarios: (i) the
positive impact of the BOS program/BOS-KITA project has led to a half of one percent
increase in enrollments at the junior secondary level; (ii) the positive impact of the BOS
program/BOS-KITA project has led to a 1 percent increase in enrollments at the junior
secondary level. The private gains resulting from such an increase are estimated by
contrasting the Net Present Value (NPV) of the direct and indirect costs 27 borne by
individuals who complete three additional years of education, to the benefits in terms of
increased expected earnings for all the additional students who make the transition to the
junior secondary level.  As Table 3 illustrates, a 1 percent increase in enrollment at the


26
   The marginal returns per year of schooling (rather than per level as reported in Table 2) are the
following: (i) Primary = 3.45 percent; (ii) Junior Secondary = 10.43 percent; (iii) Senior Secondary = 8.57
percent; and (iv) Tertiary = 9.02 percent. The annualized returns to education for levels higher than primary
are given in comparison to primary.
27
   The indirect costs include three years of foregone earnings. In line with the methodology used in the
BOS-KITA PAD and other BOS/BOS-KITA Assessments carried out by the Bank and the GoI, the
opportunity cost of junior secondary education is calculated using the assumption that 50 percent of the
individuals would be working at a wage equivalent to 60 percent of the average salary in the active
population with only primary schooling.



                                                      38
junior secondary level is projected to generate an aggregate net private gain of
approximately US$12.45 million. While these results clearly underscore the positive
economic impact created by the BOS national program and the BOS-KITA project, the
estimated gains calculated using the latest available data are lower than those projected at
appraisal largely due to the rising cost of basic education and the falling wage premiums
observed in Indonesia between 2008 and 2012.28.

5.       Savings from Reduced Repetition Rates at the Primary and Junior
Secondary levels. The main channel through which the BOS national program and the
BOS-KITA project have contributed to decreasing repetition rates at the primary and
junior secondary levels is by increasing the quality and relevance of teaching and
learning at the school level and by providing targeted support to students from the poorest
income quintile—those who typically are more likely to repeat or drop out of school.29.
Since it is difficult to partial out the relative impact the BOS program/BOS-KITA project
has had on reducing repetition rates at the primary and junior secondary levels, total
savings to the education system and Indonesian households are estimated under two
scenarios: (i) the positive impact of the BOS program/BOS-KITA project has led to a half
of one percent decrease in repetition rates at the primary and junior secondary levels; and
(ii) the positive impact of the BOS program/BOS-KITA project has led to a 1 percent
decrease in repetition rates at the primary and junior secondary levels. Using the latest
available data on the public and private cost of providing schooling to each pupil per year,
it is possible to estimate the avoided cost to the education system and to Indonesian


28
   While total and marginal returns to primary and secondary school remain high within the Indonesian
labor market, wage premiums have fallen between 2008 and 2012. As an increasing number of skilled
workers enter the labor force (as has been observed in Indonesia over the last five years), wage premiums
are expected to fall.
29
    The BOS national program has increased the quality and relevance of education in Indonesia by
providing funds for following types of activities: (i) training of teachers; (ii) purchase of new textbooks and
learning materials; and (iii) development and institutionalization of extra-curricular activities. The BOS
national program has also provided transportation subsidies for poor students to ensure that these pupils
attend school and complete their academic studies.

households from decreasing repetition rates. As Table 4 illustrates, a decrease in
repetition rates of 1 percent is estimated to generate public and private savings of
US$132.51 million at the primary level and US$66.45 million at the junior secondary
level. These savings are higher than those projected at appraisal, reflecting the increase in
public and private costs of schooling per pupil/per year over the life of the BOS-KITA
project. The rising public and private costs of schooling in Indonesia further underscores
the economic importance of ensuring that the internal efficiency of the education system
(i.e. lower repetition rates, drop-out rates, etc.) is continuously improved in the future.

6.      Reduced Financial Leakage. Prior to the launch of the BOS-KITA and BEC-TF
projects in 2008, the first Governance and Decentralization Survey (GDS1) found that
approximately 70 percent of funds allocated by all levels of Government reached the
school. By 2012, nearly 90 percent of the total funds disbursed by all levels of
Government were received by schools.30 These lower levels of financial leakage within
the education system are in part a result of the Government of Indonesia’ overall efforts
at strengthening external and internal audit systems, as well as the BOS-KITA/BEC-TF’s
increased focus on improving financial management, transparency and accountability at
the local level. The BOS Operations Manual—which was updated and revised throughout
the life of the BOS-KITA project—played a key role in minimizing the misuse of funds
at the school level by: (i) clearly stipulating eligible and ineligible expenditures
categories; (ii) strengthening financial disclosure and reporting requirements; and (iii)
strengthening community oversight over the usage of BOS funds.31.

  The revisions introduced to the BOS Operations Manual in 2009 strengthened community oversight over the usage
of BOS funds by expanding the membership of the school management teams by including a parent representative.
Prior to these updates only Principals, Treasurers and Teachers were allowed to be members of the school
committee team. The revisions to the Operations Manual also strengthened financial disclosure and

7.      Financial Sustainability of the BOS National Program Post-BOS-KITA
Project. Previous analyses conducted by the Bank and MoEC had concluded that the
BOS national program would be financially sustainable so long as the GoI only
introduced unit cost increases of less than 10 percent (in total) in the per pupil funding
formula. However, the allocation of 20 percent of the Central Government budget to
education from 2009 onwards and the substantial increase in education resources that
resulted from this policy change have significantly strengthened the financial
sustainability of the BOS national program post BOS-KITA project.32.

8.      The financial sustainability of the BOS national program is evaluated in relation
to forecasted increases to BOS program costs and the size of Indonesia’s education public
expenditure envelope. Since the BOS-KITA loan simply reimburses the GoI for a portion
of the BOS expenditures, it does not add to government expenditures like other
standalone projects funded by the Bank. The BOS national program can therefore be
considered financially sustainable provided that its share of the national education
envelope is not projected to increase exponentially post BOS-KITA project. The updated
financial sustainability analysis indicates that after the end of the BOS-KITA project in
2012, the GoI would not be spending significantly more on the BOS program as a share
of national education spending than it did pre-BOS-KITA (around 7.5 percent), even
under a model simulation which assumes high enrollment growth33 and high projected
unit cost increases34 post-2012 (Table 5). Even under these high-enrollment, high unit




reporting requirements by mandating that schools post the amount of BOS funds received and spent on
their school notice boards. Prior to 2009 schools were only required to post budget plans and record the
amount of BOS funds received on their notice boards—not the actual executed expenditures. These new
guidelines were introduced in order to increase the transparency in the use of funds at the school level.
32
   From 2001 to 2009 the Government of Indonesia’s education budget increased by over 120 percent in
real terms, with most of the increasing taking place in 2009, when the budget grew by 20 percent in real
terms over the previous year. This rapid increase in resources was mainly driven by the constitutional
amendment passed in 2002 that mandated the government to spend 20 percent of its total budget on
education. The 20 percent rule was first met in 2009, bringing education spending to over 20 percent of the
total budget share.
33
    “High enrollment growth? in this context is defined as double the average enrollment growth actually
observed in Indonesia between 2005 (the year the BOS national program was launched) and 2012 (the final
year of the BOS-KITA project). Under the high enrollment growth simulation, enrollment is projected to
grow at double the historical rate due to the significant positive impact of the BOS program on enrollments
at the primary and junior secondary levels of education.
34
   “High unit cost increases? in this context is defined as a 20 percent increase in BOS unit costs every two
years.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

A. Objective, design, implementation, and operational experience

1.      BOS is a government program designed basically to finance non-personnel costs
of basic education units by implementing agencies the Indonesian compulsory education
program. According to Government Regulation 48/2008 on Education Funding, non-
personnel costs are costs for educational consumables and overhead such as electricity,
water, telecommunications, maintenance of facilities and infrastructure, overtime pay,
transport, consuables, taxes, insurance, etc. However, there are some types of investment
and personnel financing that can be financed by the BOS funds.

2.      The general objective of the School Operational Assistance (BOS) program is to
reduce the public’s financial burden of education within the framework of providing
quality 9-year compulsory education. The particular objectives of the BOS program are
to free all students at general/special public elementary and general/special/open junior
high schools from school operational costs; free all pooor students from all fees in any
form, in public and private schools and reduce school operating cost burden at private
schools.

3.      The targets of the BOS program are all general/special elementary (SD/SDLB)
and general/special/open junior high (SMP/SMPLB/SMPT) schools, including One-Stop
SD-SMP (SATAP) and Self-Managed Learning Centers (TKBM), both public and
private, in all provinces throughout Indonesia.

4.     Number of students, unit cost and total budget from 2005 to 2012 as follows:
                           2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012

5.     Funds have been distributed on a quarterly basis, i.e. January-March, April-June,
July-September and October-December Periods. There were 3 types of fund channeling
from 2005 to 2012: (i) From 2005 to 2010 period, BOS funds were channeled through a
decentralized mechanism to Education Office at province and then transfered to schools
as block grant for all schools: (ii) in 2011 funds for private schools were channeled from



                                           47
the National Treasury (KUN) to the District Treasury (KUD) and then to schools as block
grant while funds to public schools were channeled from the State Treasury to the
districts and then to schools; and (iii) since 2012 funds have channeling has been changed
back to funds flowing from the National Treasury (KUN) to the Provinsial Treasury
(KUD) and then to schools as block grant for all schools.

6.     BOS funds has been received by schools as a total amount and managed by
schools with the involvement of a board of teachers and a School Committee by adopting
the SBM principles as follows: (a) schools should manage funds professionally,
transparently and accountably; (b) Schools should have a 4-year Medium-Term Plan; (c)
Schools should draw up an annual work plan (RKT) in the form of a School Activity and
Budget Plan (RKAS) of which BOS funds are integral part; and (d) the Medium-Term
Plan and the RKAS should be approved by a teaching board meeting with attention paid
to the School Committee’s consideration and should be legalized by the District
Education SKPD (for public schools) or by the educational foundation (for private
schools).

7.     GoI decentralized 2011 BOS fund disbursement with separate and different
disbursement mechanisms for public and private schools. BOS funds for public schools
became part of the district budget and subject to MoHA financial management
procedures. BOS funds for private schools were in the form of a block grant, managed by
the District Finance Office (DFO). This posed significant implementation problems and
delayed disbursement in every quarter with unintended negative results. Delayed
disbursement negatively affected all schools and resulted in unavoidable, unrecorded
borrowing from the SC, parents, school staff and/or office suppliers.

8.      The 2011 late disbursements became the trigger for the mechanism to revert back
to the Provinces. Central government was proactive in facilitating inter-ministerial
consultations. An Inter-Ministerial Working Group was established to put in place
strategies to remedy the situation, provide further clarification about BOS and to support
its ongoing improvement.

9.      After intensive reviews of: (i) 2011 implementation; (ii) the constraints faced by
schools and districts; (iii) findings from Regional Independent Monitoring (RIM)
surveys/other World Bank assessment results and policy advice; (iv) valuable inputs from
Parliament; and, (v) rigorous criticism from the community and media, MoEC confirmed
in November 2011, that 2012 BOS fund distribution would resume through the Provincial
government using the Block Grant mechanism, for public and private schools. The 2012
BOS guideline for the new system was signed by MoEC, MoF and MoHA in December
2011. By January 19th 2012 Provinces had disbursed 100% of BOS funding to schools for
first quarter. For second quarter 32 provinces had disbursed BOS fund to all schools on
20th April, except for the province of Aceh which received their funds on 27th April, while
for third and fourth quarter had disbursed by 20th July and 24th October 2012.

        94.96% and lower than the 2007 Baseline of 93.80%
     Junior Secondary Net Enrolment Rates is 69.96% higher than the end-target of
        68.65%
11.    Dropout and Transition Rates (based on MoEC 2011 data)
       Primary Drop-out Rates: 1.61% above the end-target of 1.56%. However,
        Dropouts have decreased continuously since the 2006 baseline.
       Junior Secondary Drop-out Rates: 1.80% below the end-target of 3.19%.
        Dropouts have decreased continuously since the 2006 baseline.
       Transition Rates from Primary to Junior Secondary: 77.26% below the end-target
        of 82.20%. However, rates have fluctuated and are below the 2006 baseline of
        82.03%.
       Transition Rates from Junior Secondary to Senior Secondary: 97.93% above the
        end-target of 97.34%. Rates have been increasing since 2010 and are higher than
        the 2006 baseline of 89.2%.

12.     Average monthly household expenditure per child on education by the poorest
quintile based on SUSENAS 2009 dataset (2012 data will not be available until 2013).
   For Primary: IDR31,270
   For Junior Secondary: IDR 58,542
    In 2012 there was a large increase in the BOS per-student allocation and it is possible
    that this reduced the fees/costs of education, because BOS manual revisions in 2012
    included provision to use BOS funds for the purchase of uniforms, shoes and
    stationery for poor students.

13.     Percentage of schools receiving funds on time. Fund disbursement was
quarterly to the majority of schools. In 2012, those located in remote areas receive funds
in two Semester installments. In FY 2012, Ministry of Finance (MoF) transferred BOS
funds to Provincial Accounts at the beginning of the first month of each quarter.
Provinces disbursed BOS funds to school bank accounts within 7 working days, as
stipulated in the BOS Manual (i.e. 1 to 11 calendar days). The return to provincial
disbursement has been a resounding success – 2012 disbursement was the fastest in the
history of the program and, other grant disbursement programs in Indonesia. In Quarter 4,
funds were transferred by the province to school bank accounts a week before the
beginning of the Quarter. In all quarters disbursement was 100%.

14.     Percentage of schools receiving full allocation of funds based on student
numbers. Through 2012 mechanism all schools have received full allocation of funds
according to student numbers. The Central government has allocated buffer funds at
central level to add to BOS funds to certain provinces if any request is received from
provinces which may have miscalculated their student data. If schools received funds
based on an incorrectly low report of student numbers in 1st quarter for example, the


                                            49
province will transfer additional fund in the second quarter alternatively, if schools
received more funds than is justified on student numbers, the province will subtract the
funds in the second quarter.

15.    Percentage of School Committees (SCs) that approve annual Budget Plans.
Based on monitoring result of the central BOS management team 87% of SCs approved
annual budget plans.

16.     Percentage of schools that have a School Improvement Plan (SIP). Based on
monitoring result of central BOS management Team 71% of SMPs had an SIP (Rencana
Kerja Sekolah – RKS) and 93% had an annual School Budget Plan. In 2011 and 2012 the
Government of Indonesia trained to all primary and secondary schools across Indonesia.
This intensive training program (known as “2011 BOS Training?) was delivered to
school and madrasah management teams, comprising principals, staff treasurers and
community representatives (i.e. school committee or community member from BOS
school team) from all primary and junior secondary schools (SD and SMP) and Madrasah
(MI and MTs). The program has focused on building core skills in school-based
management, including providing an introduction to school and madrasah self-evaluation,
comprehensive training in budgeting and planning, and financial management. The
training budget was funded by AusAID, the World Bank, the Dutch Government,
European Union, ADB and USAID. These donors contributed in form of providing
technical assistance especially in preparation step. The World Bank had a significant
contributions in the preparation of training in the form of workshops, material
development, training of trainers, and developing of training materials, supplying and
distributing of materials in form of CD’s for all schools)

17.    Percentage of schools with relevant Procurement Plans. Central BOS
Management Team findings were that 71% of schools sample had a procurement plan. In
general all procurement processes were found to be in line with the Project Operations
Manual.

18.    Percentage of schools that disclose the BOS expenditure by category on the
notice board. Central BOS Management Team findings were that 78% of schools sample
disclosed the amount of BOS funds received and 80% disclose expenditures.

19.     Increased public information and dissemination regarding BOS. Wider
dissemination of BOS socialization materials was taking place. The types of materials
include: BOS information briefs released during national media events; the BOS Manual
distributed to all schools and available on the BOS dedicated and secure MoEC website
www.bos.kemdikbud.go.id along with other BOS relevant information (for example: BOS
allocation per school, BOS Eligible Expenditure information, Director General Circulars).
GoI disclosed BOS disbursement information by school on this website, starting in end of
2012. An improved complaint handling system was launched in 2012. It provides a
streamlined approach to monitor and investigate allegations about the misuse of funds. It
is managed and monitored by the CPIU who handle the complaint.

20.     Percentage of parents knowledgeable on BOS. Based on monitoring results of
central BOS management Team 97.6 % of parents knew schools received BOS, 97.6 %
of parents knew about BOS and 92.8 % of parents knew about “sekolah gratis? policy.

21.     Improved monitoring and evaluation. BOS Program Managers, Schools and
Communities increased their monitoring of the program in order to improve its
effectiveness. Monitoring and evaluation has been generally conducted by the District
BOS Management Team staffed by education office staff, school supervisors, sometimes
in collaboration with the provincial office. The role of the school supervisor was
expanded in 2012 following Bank input to discussions about ways to integrate BOS
Program monitoring into routine school supervision; this requirement has been stipulated
in the BOS Manual since 2012

22.    Annual consolidated reports produced as a result of Management
Information Systems (MIS) improvements. MoEC introduced the School Data
Collection Database (Pendataan Sekolah) in all schools in 2012. It replaced an integrated
database comprised of the School Application Package (Paket Aplikasi Sekolah – PAS),
the Education Data and Information database (Pangkalan Data dan Informasi Pendidikan
– PADATI). Every school has to entry to the system its students data (by name by
address), teachers data and school data.

23.     The World Bank in collaboration with other Development partners supported the
BOS program. Some support for the BOS program, specifically from World Bank, is as
follows: (a) input to BOS Manual Based on Analysis; (b) support to BOS Training
preparation and training implementation; (c) conduct Regional Independent Monitoring;
(d) support for the Social Marketing and Information Campaign (SMIC) in 2009 and
2011BOS training; (e) developing the complaint handling mechanism; (f) analysis of
fund flow mechanism and (f) conduct studies on BOS impact.

24.     In collaboration with World Bank, GoI’s CPIU and WB’s task team have been
working closely. Central BOS management team has always shared issues with the Bank
and requested the Bank to support government to resolve relevant issues. In the same way,
World Bank’s team has also shared their recommendations/inputs to the BOS Team if
there are any important findings relevant for government. The World Bank had often
invited GoI’s stakeholders to participate in international events especially for promoting
and sharing BOS program’s experiences.

25.     Some improvements for BOS Program have been accomplished and will be
always improved in the future. The BOS Program has also brought inspirations for other
programs in MOEC as follows: (a) extending BOS to Senior High Schools and Higher
Education; (b) synergized policy for education management and governance at sub-
national level; (c) strengthening SBM to improve the quality of education outcomes and
school governance; (d) reviewing school financing requirements specifically Education
Unit Costs, BOS Unit Costs; (e) developing and implementing a formula-based national
BOS allocation mechanism on the basis of fairness and equity; (f) establishing incentives
for district financing to meet Minimum Service Standards in Education; (g) encouraging

districts to allocate counterpart funds (BOSDA) on the basis of access, equity and
performance improvement; (h) building district-level capacity and capability for results-
oriented management; (i) financial management capacity and capability building for
Principals and Treasurers; (j) increased parental and community oversight ; (k) valid and
reliable data collection by school and by student name; (l) e-monitoring for fund
distribution and (m) e-Complaint Handling
