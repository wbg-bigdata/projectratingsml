    F. Results Framework Analysis

    Program Development Objectives (PDOs):

    The main Program Development Objectives were to help reduce future risks to the stability of the Former
    Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia) by strengthening sustainability of public finances and the
    resilience of the financial sector, to support improved protection of the most vulnerable, and to enhance
    incentives for formal labor market participation. The supported Government program largely draws from the
    ruling party’s Election Manifesto for the 2011 Parliamentary elections as well as additional analyses and
    consultations. The program calls for prudent fiscal policy and a sustainable fiscal deficit level as well as a
    reduction in non-priority spending and an increase in capital spending. It also envisages reforms in social
    protection to improve the protection of the most vulnerable. It calls for more effective management of resources
    in the health sector (that is, the introduction of the treasury function) and identifies the need for revisions to the
    Basic Benefit Package. The program also proposes actions to strengthen the performance of the financial sector.
    These overarching goals are broadly shared across the political spectrum, which provides relatively broad
    consensus for the reform program.

    A key objective of the Policy Based Guarantee (PBG) was to provide improved market access by enabling FYR
    Macedonia to tap funding from the international bank loan market, which it had not done before. Second, the
    PBG was expected to allow FYR Macedonia to borrow on improved terms, including longer tenor and lower
    cost. Finally, the expectation was that the PBG presents an opportunity to expand the country’s investor base on
    favorable terms, and have positive spillover effects for future sovereign and corporate borrowing. In line with
    the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) policy on PBGs, the proposed operation
    should: (i) provide incremental market access; (ii) leverage the Bank’s capital better than a DPL; and (iii)
    improve FYR Macedonia’s borrowing terms considerably. The Government used the PBG to borrow EUR130
    million in December 2011, covering over half of the fiscal deficit at a reasonable cost (4.3 percent interest rate)
    and 5 years maturity. The PBG better leveraged the Bank’s capital by allowing FYR Macedonia to contract a
    sizable commercial loan of EUR130 million, out of which EUR100 million, equivalent of US$134.9 million,
    were guaranteed by IBRD.

    This Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) has been prepared on the basis of information
    available as of March 2013, drawn from: (i) Bank Program Documents (PDs), Implementation Status and
    Results Reports (ISRs) and other internal documents; (ii) IMF country reports; (iii) the conclusions of an ICR
    workshop in March 2013 in Skopje; and (iv) various Government data sources.

                       below 500 bps in March 2012. However, at this time no international bonds were
                       issued or loans contracted. The EUR75 million loan from Deutsche Bank attracted an
                       interest rate of 6.5 percent, representing a spread of 533 bps above Euribor, slightly
                       above the target rate.
       Comments
                       At appraisal it was expected that the global and Euro zone economies would improve
                       over 2012 and recover in mid-2011. However, the Euro zone debt crisis continued to
                       spread further and even intensified in immediately neighboring Greece, which
                       continued to make financial market access at reasonable rates difficult for Macedonia.

                                1.           Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

       1.1 Context at Appraisal

Overview of the Preceding Operation

1.      The reform program supported by the Policy Based Guarantee (PBG) was originally designed as
the second operation of a series of two programmatic Development Policy Loans (DPLs) to the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia). The first (DPL1) of the two programmatic DPLs1 in
the amount of US$39 million was disbursed in April 2010 and closed on December 30, 2010. The
Government of FYR Macedonia (Government) subsequently requested that the second DPL (DPL2) be
converted into a stand-alone PBG. As such, the DPL series was closed in December 2010 and an
Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) completed for DPL1.2 This ICR therefore covers
only the PBG. However, many indicators used in DPL1 were set to be met only after the completion of
reforms supported by DPL2 (now the PBG). In addition, since the PBG retained largely the same policy
matrix as was envisaged for DPL2, it can be seen as the successor to DPL1.

2.      DPL1 supported Government’s reform program focusing on fiscal management, social protection
and the financial sector with the objectives: (i) to manage the impact of the global crisis by maintaining a
sound macroeconomic and fiscal framework; (ii) to cushion the impact on the poor and vulnerable by
enhancing social protection systems; and (iii) to strengthen resilience of the financial sector by addressing
potential vulnerabilities. The ICR rated DPL1 as satisfactory in every dimension. The program was based
on an extensive analytic foundation, including a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), a Public
Expenditure Review a Poverty Assessment, a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), and a policy
note prepared specifically to define an appropriate policy response to the crisis. The operation was
consistent with Government's priorities as well as with the Bank's Country Partnership Strategy. The risk
to the development outcome was assessed as moderate given the country’s strong implementation track
record. However, a lingering risk stemming from the continued uncertain external environment, which
could result in balance of payments problems and increasing difficulties in accessing financial markets,
was identified. Bank performance was considered as satisfactory both as regards to the quality at entry
and supervision. Borrower performance was also rated satisfactory. The Independent Evaluation Group
endorsed the ICR ratings. It noted that the Bank acted swiftly to help FYR Macedonia limit the effects of
the global financial crisis by providing financing, policy advice and leveraging support from other donors.
In terms of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) arrangements, the operation's performance indicators,
which were limited to a few, focused on key aspects of the reform program and were well specified.

3.       Government expressed general interest in a PBG in late 2010, having seen its positive impact in
neighboring Serbia. While preparations for the second DPL progressed, the option of converting DPL2 to
a PBG was also discussed. Following internal Bank consultation, Government requested in early 2011 the
conversion of the planned US$30 million DPL2 to a US$120 million PBG supporting a market
transaction. Formal preparations for the PBG started in February 2011 and following Parliamentary
elections in on June 5, 2011 the Board approved the PBG on November 10, 2011.

Rationale for Use of PBG in Macedonia

4.       At the time of appraisal Government was of the view that a PBG could help the country re-
establish its access to the bond market or access the loan market for the first time. FYR Macedonia had
borrowed twice from the international bond market, with widely varying results. In 2005, strong credit

                                                                  1 
 
 

fundamentals and favorable market conditions allowed the Government to issue a 10-year global bond at
a spread of 120 bp (or 4.625 percent coupon). But in 2009, global financial turmoil led to a far less
favorable 3.5-year bond issue at 620 bp (or 9.875 percent coupon). A planned bond issue in 2010 was
cancelled because the available terms were not acceptable to the Government.

5.      In addition to the country’s recent experience with capital markets, the World Bank team’s
assessment was that a PBG could add value for FYR Macedonia as the private capital market was likely
to remain tight for sovereign debt issuance due to the country’s proximity to the epicenter of the Euro
zone crisis and the relatively small size of issuance. Given past strong macroeconomic and structural
reform performance, FYR Macedonia fulfilled the stringent eligibility criteria for the PBG instrument.
The country had a strong track-record of conservative fiscal policies resulting in a relatively low level of
public debt. FYR Macedonia had also taken effective measures to fight poverty.

6.      Although markets had somewhat stabilized in 2011, financing conditions still remained fragile.
The near-collapse of Greece and then Ireland — and continuing nervousness about even larger economies
like Portugal and Spain — had left bond investors risk averse. Sub-investment grade states outside the
Euro zone did have market access, but at unfavorable terms, and there was uncertainty about the direction
of the market over the coming six months. For FYR Macedonia, market sounding at the time suggested a
maximum feasible tenor of five years, with a credit spread in the range of 400-500 bp over the high-grade
swap rate (about 6.5-7.5 percent in aggregate).

7.      The main rationale for the PBG was to facilitate market access, have a catalytic function in this
regard, and to minimize costs. The structure of the instrument was decided after due diligence regarding
the country’s position on capital markets and consultations with the Government and its financial
advisers. The option of a bond and loan were considered, with the option of a bond likely to be able to
better measure the added value of a World Bank PBG. However, as expected, a key factor for the
Government was the cost, which due to provisioning practices was more favorable for the loan market.
The task team’s market sounding established that a PBG would lower Macedonia’s borrowing costs and,
perhaps more importantly, mitigate the risk that market access would be closed entirely in the event of
another Euro zone crisis.

Political Context

8.      Parliamentary elections were due in mid-2012, after the ruling coalition between VMRO-
DPMNE and ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) won over two thirds of the
parliamentary seats in the 2008 early elections. Following a dispute between the ruling coalition and the
opposition, on January 28, 2011 the opposition SDSM left the Parliament in protest, demanding early
elections. The Prime Minister accepted the request and announced early elections on February 23, 2011.

9.      Parliamentary elections were held in June 2011, bringing to a close several months of political
disruptions. The VMRO-DPMNE and their coalition partners retained their parliamentary majority,
winning 71 out of 123 seats, but did not recapture their previous two-thirds majority. Opposition parties
(notably the center-left SDSM) gained some ground. However, Government’s stable majority in
Parliament resulted in a continuation of economic policies and priorities. These focused on
macroeconomic stability, growth acceleration, and poverty and unemployment reduction.

Economic Context

10.     FYR Macedonia’s growth outlook at the time of the PBG preparation was fragile (Table 1),
although growth during 2010 and 2011 appeared to be on the path to recovery at 2.9 and 2.8 percent
respectively. The country was potentially vulnerable to second-round effects of the financial crisis
through: (i) lower demand for its exports; (ii) contagion through the financial sector; and (iii) reduced

remittance flows.

        Exports fell rapidly from 50 percent of GDP in 2008 to 38 percent in 2009. The economic
         slowdown in FYR Macedonia’s main trading partners — including Germany, Bulgaria and the
         Western Balkans — were a cause for concern. Trade with Greece, which was FYR Macedonia’s
         third largest trading partner in 2011, fell from 10 percent of total trade in 2008 to 7 percent in 2011,
         largely reflecting a decline in exports to Greece. Greece is also an important transport corridor for
         FYR Macedonian exports. Risk of prolonged closures due to strikes at facilities such as the Greek
         port of Thessaloniki added to the poor economic climate. Nonetheless, FYR Macedonian exports
         rebounded well, and reached 53 percent of GDP by 2011 — above pre-crisis levels.

        The banking sector in FYR Macedonia was highly concentrated and potentially exposed to external
         risks. The three largest banks controlled over 70 percent of banking assets and two of these had
         foreign parent banks (from Greece and Slovenia).

        The risk of difficult labor market conditions in countries where large numbers of Macedonians
         work (for example, Germany and Austria) posed a threat to remittances. However, migrants

GDP in 2007 to a deficit of 0.9 percent in 2008. As the global financial crisis began to weigh on FYR
Macedonia, the deficit increased further to 2.7 percent in 2009 (Figure 1). Spending increased from
around 32 percent of GDP in 2007 to around 34 percent in 2008 despite the hit that revenues took during
the crisis (Figure 1). In addition, the authorities reduced social insurance contributions to help
employment and competitiveness and were careful to maintain allocations of well-targeted social transfers
to support those most vulnerable to the crisis.

12.      External balances normalized during 2010 and 2011. The current account deficit decreased from
13 percent of GDP in 2008 to around 2.5 percent in 2010 and 2011. The weak internal and external
environments caused imports and exports of goods and services to plummet in 2009, the former
decreasing from 76 to 61 percent of GDP and the latter from 50 to 38 percent. Both picked up in 2010 and
almost reached their pre-crisis peak by 2011. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) took a hit during the global
financial crisis, falling to 2.2 percent of GDP in 2009 from six percent the previous year. However, it
rebounded on the back of an improved business climate (FYR moved up from rank 75 in the World
Bank’s Doing Business Indicators in 2008 to rank 38 in 20113). The country was able to attract investors
such as Johnson Controls and Johnson Matthey, and much of FDI was second-generation investments that
expanded existing production facilities. Remittances remained stable at around 19 percent of GDP during
the crisis and the recovery.

13.      External debt increased during the crisis and its aftermath but public debt remained at sustainable
levels. External debt increased from around 45 to 65 percent of GDP by the end of 2011 (Figure 2). The
share of public debt in external debt rose from 34 percent in 2008 to 43 percent in 2011 as the
Government sought additional external financing to fund the fiscal stimulus.

14.      Monetary and exchange rate policy supported price stability during the crisis and the recovery
period. The de facto exchange rate peg with the Euro4 was maintained. The Consumer Price Index (CPI)
peaked in 2008 due to high international food prices, but came down to around four percent by 2011.
International reserves picked up in 2010 (after a dip in 2009) and remained above four months of goods
and service imports. With a stable exchange rate, reasonable inflation levels and comfortable international
reserves, the authorities were able to use monetary policy measures to help support the recovery. This
included progressively lowering interest rates during 2010 (Figure 3).

    FYR Macedonian denar is allowed to fluctuate only around a very limited band close to 61.4 denars to the Euro.

15.      In the financial sector, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) took measures
to mitigate the risk of spillover in the banking sector by adopting strict regulations. These included: (i)
limiting the exposure of subsidiaries toward (foreign) parent banks to 10 percent of the bank’s capital; (ii)
performing semi-annual stress tests simulating the possible channels of contagion from the negative
effects of the Greek and Euro zone crisis to the domestic banking sector based on different hypothetical
scenarios; and (iii) strengthening the deposit insurance framework. As a result, trust in banks and
financial institutions in FYR Macedonia increased during the crisis, in fact; it was above the average in
the region according to the Life in Transition Survey of 2010. Deposits also increased by 11 percent in
2011.

Social Indicators

16.      Some social indicators show that living conditions worsened during the crisis and the decline in
unemployment slowed. The relative poverty headcount (Figure 4) surged from 2008 to 2009, but has
retreated since then. The Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) provides internationally
comparable poverty estimations. The latest SILC, undertaken in 2010, found that 27.3 percent of the
population lived in poverty, well above the EU average of 16.4 percent. National data, provided by the
State Statistics Office, allow for some comparison over time, but result in slightly higher poverty rates
than the international definition (Figure 4). Unemployment remained among the highest level in Europe.
However, contrary to neighboring countries, unemployment decreased slightly from 32.0 percent in 2010
to about 31.4 percent in 2011 (Figure 4), but at a slower rate than the years before. Females’ activity
remained low, with a participation rate of around 44 percent compared with 69 percent for males. The
participation rate for both males and females remained relatively stable since the start of 2009.

     1.2    Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

17.     The PBG supported the Government’s reform program aimed at strengthening sustainability of
public finances, improving the performance of social protection and functioning of labor markets, and
strengthening the resilience of the financial sector.

18.     PBGs have the objective to: (i) provide incremental market access; (ii) leverage the Bank’s
capital better than a DPL; and (iii) improve the country’s borrowing terms considerably. A key

                                                             6 
 
 

objective of this PBG was to enable FYR Macedonia to issue debt at improved terms, including longer
tenor and lower cost. Finally, the expectation was that as a result of the PBG transaction, the
Government would afterwards be able to access the market on its own at favorable terms. Those
expected result would be measured with two key outcome indicators discussed below (paragraph 20).

19.      The Government used the PBG to borrow EUR130 million in December 2011, covering over
half of the fiscal deficit at a 4.3 percent interest rate and 5 years maturity. The PBG better leveraged
the Bank’s capital by allowing FYR Macedonia to contract a sizable commercial loan of EUR130
million, out of which EUR100 million, equivalent of US$134.9 million, were guaranteed by IBRD.

Key Indicators of PDOs

20.     The PBG had ten outcome indicators. The first two outcome indicators related to improvement in
the access to international financial markets:

     1. Government independently raises funding from international markets in 2012.
     2. Government raises euro loan/bond funding with a maturity of at least five years at an interest
        rate below Euribor plus 500 bps.

Five outcome indicators monitored progress under the pillar of strengthening sustainability of public
finances and functioning of labor markets:

     3. The general Government wage bill maintained at below 32 percent of general Government
        revenues in 2011.
     4. Increase in the number of formal workers with paid social insurance contributions from 407,887
        in 2009 to 420,000 in 2011.
     5. Pension spending is maintained at less than nine percent of GDP in 2011.
     6. Arrears in the public health sector (Health Insurance Fund and Health Care Institutions) do not
        exceed 1.7 billion Denars (0.4 percent of GDP) in 2011.
     7. Comprehensive financial reports on public health institutions were available publicly on a
        monthly basis in 2011.

Two outcome indicators measured expected results under the pillar of improving performance of social
protection:

     8. Processing time for Social Financial Assistance application reduced from a baseline of 30 days
        in 2011.
     9. Percentage of cash benefits going to the poorest quintile increased from 37 percent in 2009 to 40
        percent in 2011, and further increases thereafter.

One indicator measured performance under a third pillar of strengthening resilience of the financial
sector:

     10. Financial soundness indicators (FSI) were regularly reported and monitored and the Financial
         Stability Report discussed and acted upon by the Financial Stability Committee (FSC), and
         policy responses were coordinated among the National Bank of Republic of Macedonia,
         Ministry of Finance and Deposit Insurance Fund.

        1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

21.         Under PBG the following three pillars were supported:

           (i)    Strengthening sustainability of public finances and functioning of labor markets: Pillar
           I of the PBG supported measures to control spending pressures as well as improve the functioning
           of the labor market by reducing costs and removing incentives for informal labor participation. In
           particular, the PBG supported the tight management of the wage bill to allow for reallocation of
           scarce resources to more productive goals. Another supported measure was to reduce the tax
           wedge while safeguarding the long-term sustainability of the pension system. To improve labor
           market functioning, reforms supported the provision of free health insurance by de-linking
           provision of free health insurance from registration as unemployed. This pillar also supported the
           improvement of efficiency in health spending through the introduction of a new Health Single
           Treasury Account covering all public health institutions. To strengthen sustainability of the public
           health sector, one measure supported the adoption of a program for a first phase of long-term
           reforms.

           (ii) Improving performance of social protection. Pillar II of the PBG supported efforts to
           protect vulnerable groups in the short term, but also structural reforms to improve effectiveness
           and administration of social benefits over the medium term. It supported greater allocation of
           resources for well-targeted Social Financial Assistance (SFA) and reforms that should eventually
           result in better targeting and lower leakage and exclusion. Specifically, the introduction of an
           energy poverty program and the piloting of a Cash Benefit Management Information System
           (CBMIS) were supported by the PBG.

           (iii) Strengthening resilience of the financial sector. Pillar III supported measures that
           increased independence and accountability of the monetary authority as well as measures to reduce
           further risks in the financial system. In particular, the PBG supported a new central bank law and a
           functioning FSC to regularly monitor and assess systemic risks and coordinate policy response to
           address potential build-up of risks.

       2.1     Program Performance

22.     There was agreement among the Government, civil society, development partners, private sector
representatives (including commercial banks), and NBRM that the PBG was of crucial importance in
providing FYR Macedonia access to the international capital market at a time of great global uncertainty
(Annex 7). There was also consensus that the supported program focused on structural reforms, which

helped keep fiscal balances manageable in the short term, and facilitated stronger growth and promoted
social cohesion in the long term. There have been noticeable improvements across a number of important
areas supported by the PBG, which laid the groundwork for future recovery from the crisis.

23.      The PBG transaction itself covered over half of the fiscal deficit in 2011 at a very reasonable cost
(Annex 7). Despite being so large, PBG does not appear to have had a disruptive impact on the financial
sector, and may even have helped to ‘crowd in’ domestic credit as it was sourced externally. As well as
being instrumental in financing the deficit, the PBG allowed the Government to maintain their financial
reserves at a comfortable level during 2012 and may have made it easier to issue domestic bonds
(including using foreign currency clauses to protect the purchaser against currency depreciation). Finally,
because it was externally sourced, the PBG enabled the authorities to maintain foreign reserves at
adequate levels, thus helping to maintain the exchange rate peg in a volatile economic environment.

24.     Following the PBG transaction, the Government was successful in accessing the market on its
own and at favorable terms. Those results were captured by two key outcome indicators discussed below
(see paragraph 29).

        Prior Actions, Triggers and Their Implementation

25.      The nine prior actions (PAs) for the operations are presented in
26.      Table 2. Annex 6 shows in detail the evolution of triggers for DPL2 to prior actions of the PBG.
The policy actions were substantially the same in strength when transitioned to the PBG. One trigger was
dropped and four modified. One trigger was dropped because it was covered by the requirement of a
satisfactory macroeconomic framework. The authorities proposed three new PBG prior actions, aimed at
ensuring that the program remains strong and the objectives are met: (i) de-linking the provision of free
health insurance from the status of the unemployed, (ii) the introduction of an energy poverty program,
and (iii) the establishment of the FSC (which was initially envisaged as a benchmark for DPL 2).
27.      Table 2 shows PAs as implemented before Board presentation.


        Implementation and Outcomes

28.      Implementation progress to date (March 2013) has been satisfactory, as evidenced by the
satisfactory completion of the reform program, leading to a second Public Expenditure PBG, approved by
the Bank Board on January 8, 2013. Out of ten outcome indicators, eight have been fully achieved (see
section F above). One was missed, but could be considered to be outside of Government’s influence, and
on one there is a dispute about the validity of the data point measured.

29.     Access to the international capital market increased: the authorities borrowed EUR75 million
from Deutsche Bank in July 2012. The target on the interest rate was missed, albeit slightly. The Credit
Default Swap (CDS) spread for traded 5-year bonds temporarily fell to below 500 bps in March 2012.
However, at this time no international bonds were issued or loans contracted. The EUR75 million loan
from Deutsche Bank attracted an interest rate of 6.5 percent, representing a spread of 533 bps above
Euribor, slightly above the target rate. At appraisal it was expected that the global and Euro zone
economies would improve over 2012. However, the Euro zone debt crisis continued to spread further and
even intensified in immediately neighboring Greece, which continued to make accessing financial markets
at reasonable rates difficult for Macedonia.

30.     The Government continued with implementation of tight control over wages and employment in
2011. The target on the wage bill containment was met and the general Government wage bill was
maintained well below the targeted 32 percent, at 24.1 percent. The target of increasing the number of
formal workers with paid social insurance contributions from 407,887 in 2009 to 420,000 in 2012 was
surpassed: this number increased to 467,609 in 2012 (January-September). Authorities have continued to

implement prudent policies with regard to pension and indexation and administration. The target of
maintaining pension spending under nine percent of GDP was achieved. In 2012, pension spending was
7.7 percent of GDP. Government continued its efforts in effectively managing resources in the health
sector. The target on health sector arrears was met and the Health Insurance Fund (HIF) publishes
financial statements on a monthly basis. At the end of 2011, health sector arrears were contained at MKD
1.436 billion or 0.3 percent of GDP. However, there was the expectation that arrears would decrease more
swiftly in coming years; instead they increased again during 2012, mainly due to high heating and
electricity costs. The Ministry of Health (MOH) is currently implementing new heating systems in major
HCIs in order to further decrease inefficiencies and costs.

31.     The Government also succeeded in implementing reform measures which improved the protection
of the most vulnerable groups. The processing time for SFA decreased to 19 days for new applicants, 13
days for existing beneficiaries (as compared to 30 days in the baseline and as prescribed by Law).5 In
2011, the Government introduced a program on subsidizing energy consumption (as a top up for SFA).
The indicator was tracked through the Household Budget Survey (HBS), but there are concerns on the
survey’s methodology in recent years, that led to doubts about the validity of the data. There is, therefore,
reason to believe that this indicator is not capturing true poverty trends.

32.       The target for the final outcome indicator on strengthening financial sector resilience was
achieved. The 2011 Financial Stability Report was published in August 2012 (see:
http://www.nbrm.mk/WBStorage/Files/WebBuilder_FSR_2011_ang_web.pdf). The 2010 Financial
Stability Report was published during 2011. There are regular quarterly meetings of the Financial
Stability Committee.

              2.2            Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

33.    A number of factors contributed to the broadly successful implementation and outcome of the
PBG. The key factors are the following: (i) alignment with the Government’s reform program; (ii)
Government ownership; (iii) a good analytical basis; (iv) the Bank’s presence on the ground and close
involvement in the areas covered by the supported reform program; and (v) early and close engagement
with commercial banks.

34.     Alignment with Government Reform Program. The PBG was aligned with the Government’s
overall reform program and strategically focused on areas of reform that were of key importance at the
time.

35.    Government ownership. The Government was fully committed to completion and timely
implementation of reforms. The Government was closely involved in the design and preparation stage of
PBG. There were no policy reversals.

36.     Good analytical basis: The PBG built effectively on a substantial amount of high quality and
relevant analytical work. This is well documented in the PD (Table 10) summarizing the analytical work
by area and links to the PBG. Table 3 lists the main reports, as well as the links to principal policy
recommendations.

37.     Bank presence on the ground and link to the Bank’s program: The PBG program was well linked
to key areas of Bank’s engagement in FYR Macedonia, for example, its social protection program (Box 1)

                                                            
5
    However, since the formulation of the outcome indicator, changes were made in 2011 to the Law on Social
    Financial Assistance in terms of the processing time, increasing the maximum processing time from 30 to 60 days,
    but at the same time providing sanctions for processing delays.

                                                               11 
 
 

and health sector Technical Assistance (TA). In most areas a previously established dialogue and presence
of key sector staff in the field helped lay the basis for the design and fast processing of the operation.

38.      Early and close engagement with commercial banks was essential to sound out the market and to
provide the best instrument to the client. The PBG allowed the Government of FYR Macedonia to
develop a professional relationship with commercial banks involved in the transaction. Commercial banks
indicated that the instrument allowed them to engage in a country that they would have otherwise not
considered due to lack of familiarity and difficult external macroeconomic environment. They noted that
it was of key importance to have had the Bank help facilitate the process of putting FYR Macedonia out
into the international loan market. Having gone through the process (for example, having worked with a
local legal counsel) increased their likelihood to consider follow-up transactions with FYR Macedonia.
Both banks involved in the PBG transaction have since started a broader dialogue with Government.
Banks also noted that there was a wider market impact, not just for the two banks, but increased interest
from the limited pool of banks considering sovereign lending due to the positive reporting on the
transaction in the international press.

Box 1: Complementarity with other Bank Projects
The PBG supported reforms designed to strengthen the functioning of social safety nets. It complemented the World
Bank’s Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) Project, the implementation of which was ongoing at the time of the PBG1.
The aim of the CCT project was to strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of FYR Macedonia’s social safety net
through: (a) the introduction of conditional cash transfers; and (b) improvements in the administration, oversight,
monitoring, and evaluation of social assistance transfers. The project supported the implementation of a CCT
program for poor families contingent upon the secondary school enrollment and attendance of their children. The
project also supported improvements in overall safety net administration. The second pillar of the PBG was fully in
line with the aims of the CCT project. In particular, the PBG supported the development of the Cash Benefits
Management Information System (CBMIS). That was an important pre-condition for the CCT program and CBMIS
considerably improved the administration of cash benefits and reduced leakage in the system. The administration of
SFA through the CBMIS decreased the time required for processing payments of cash benefits, decreased the
administrative burden on the employees in the Social Welfare Centers, and created an appropriate database for
analysis of cash benefits for the purpose of further policy change. Based on figures from the Project Management
Unit, CCT secondary education program coverage increased from about 72 percent of eligible children in the school
year 2011/2012 to about 86 percent in 2012/2013.

          2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

39.     The M&E of the PBG relied on Government’s arrangements, consistent with the PBG policy
matrix. The Ministry of Finance was responsible for monitoring and the overall implementation of the
PBG, including for coordinating actions among other concerned ministries and agencies. Other agencies
involved included the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy, the Ministry of Health, and the National Bank
of Republic of Macedonia. The Bank worked closely with the Ministry of Finance and the other agencies
to monitor actions and review implementation progress. This approach worked very well and there was
ongoing tracking of reforms and outcome indicators.

          2.4      Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

40.    It is expected that the Bank will continue to provide support to FYR Macedonia through
development policy operations and/or PBGs. In fact, since the approval of the first PBG, a Programmatic
Competitiveness DPL series was approved in November 2012 and a second PBG, a Public Expenditure
PBG, was approved in January 2013. This was justified by: (i) financing needs; (ii) satisfactory
performance to date with respect to the implementation of Government’s reform program as measured by:
the outcome indicators, and the implementation of policy actions; and (iii) the satisfactory
macroeconomic framework.

41.     The PBG was regarded as a great success by the authorities in terms of allowing access to the
financial markets at favorable rates. As the financial market situation did not improve as envisioned and
the Euro zone crisis dragged out, the Government did approach the World Bank in the second half of 2012
to have a then planned Public Expenditure DPL converted into another PBG. The Public Expenditure
PBG was also part of the World Bank’s crisis-related assistance to FYR Macedonia aimed at mitigating
the impact of the renewed Euro zone turmoil.

42.     The Public Expenditure PBG continued previous reforms. The Program Development Objective
was to improve the efficiency of public expenditures by strengthening public financial management
practices; improving the efficiency of service provision in the health sector; and strengthening social
protection and inclusion. The overarching goal was to ensure that fiscal policy, and public expenditure
policy in particular, supports an environment conducive to growth, more effective social protection, and
improved service delivery.

43.     The Public Expenditure PBG supported, in particular, measures to strengthen financial discipline,

                                                        13 
 
 

which had deteriorated during the recent crisis. Specifically, this included the clearance of arrears for
VAT returns and invoices related to contractual obligations for goods and services provided by the private
sector, as well as the prevention of future arrears build-up by improving budgeting procedures and
increasing incentives for compliance.

44.      The case of FYR Macedonia indicates that, under crisis circumstances, there may be a case for a
series of PBGs for a country. Macedonia managed to access the market once after PBG, but the prolonged
Euro zone crisis later hindered its market access once again.

                                   3.      Assessment of Outcomes

            3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

45.     All components of the PBG — and thus the program as a whole — were relevant to
Government’s objectives to: (i) strengthen the sustainability of public finances and functioning of labor
markets; (ii) improve the performance of social protection; and (iii) strengthen resilience of the financial
sector.

46.      The design was satisfactory. The PBG program produced significant results in terms of reducing
risks to stability by strengthening sustainability of public finances and the resilience of the financial
sector, and supporting improved protection of the most vulnerable and enhancing incentives for formal
labor market participation. There were only minor areas where the design could have been improved
(paragraph 47). The design was selective, yet covered key areas of reform. Substantial efforts were
expended by the Bank team to design a strong program. Despite considerable challenges during the
implementation of DPL1 and the PBG, i.e. the high level of uncertainty during the prolonged crisis
period, and the complexity of its potential transmission to FYR Macedonia the program was delivered on
time.

47.     However, the results framework and the selection and presentation of outcome indicators could
have been somewhat stronger. Specifically, the baselines and targets of results indicators should have
been clearly stated.

48.     The prior actions were clearly formulated and focused on key elements of the reform program.
Perhaps the prior action focusing on the health sector could have been more explicit, but the Program
Document delivered a clear explanation of it. As indicated above, all prior actions were implemented prior
to the Board approval and no reforms have been reversed.

         3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

49.   Progress towards development objectives is rated as satisfactory. The quality of the results
framework was also satisfactory: there were strong links between policy actions and desired outcomes.

50.     The objectives were closely aligned with the expected outcomes of the Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS): (i) continued macroeconomic stability; (ii) improved effectiveness of the social safety net;
and (iii) reduced labor market impediments. The reform program was also consistent with the
Government’s aspiration for eventual membership in the EU. The PBG is expected to have a positive
impact on the functioning of labor markets, the conduct of economic and monetary policy and social
cohesion, which have been identified as critical benchmarks to begin membership negotiations.

51.     The PBG was a cornerstone of the World Bank’s support in FYR Macedonia during the
prolonged Euro zone crisis. It provided the conditions for a loan which helped Government access
substantial financing to FYR Macedonia’s budget. The PBG covered over half of the fiscal deficit in

                                                    14 
 
 

2011. As well as being instrumental in financing the deficit, it allowed the Government to maintain its
financial reserves at a comfortable level during 2012 and may have made it easier to issue domestic
bonds.


52.     All components of the supported program were important and the program design was
underpinned by a robust suite of analytical pieces. There was an adequate focus on measures to strengthen
the sustainability of public finances, strengthening resilience of the financial sector, and improving the
performance of social protection and functioning of labor markets. A more detailed account of
achievements towards the development objectives is provided in Annex 7.

                3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

53.      The overall outcome can be considered as satisfactory, given the satisfactory to highly
satisfactory implementation and outcomes, as well as the overall relevance of the PBG.

54.      Table 4 summarizes the assessment of the relevance, design, results framework, implementation,
progress towards development objectives, and achievements. The last column provides the overall
outcome rating which, according to ICR guidelines, combines the indicators for: (i) the relevance of
objectives/design, and (ii) the achievement of development objectives. As shown, all outcome overall
ratings are satisfactory or highly satisfactory. Therefore, the aggregate overall rating is satisfactory.6


                3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

    (a)         Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

55.      The PBG supported several reforms designed to have beneficial poverty impacts in a difficult
economic climate, and some of these may also have had gender-differentiated impacts. After increasing
during the crisis, poverty fell in 2010 and 2011. The poverty headcount fell from 31.1 percent in 2009 to
30.4 percent in 20117. Labor market reforms and safeguarding the poor and vulnerable against electricity
price increases may have contributed to poverty reduction.

             The PBG supported a reduction in social insurance contribution rates through amendments to the
              Law on Contributions to Compulsory Social Insurance in December 2009. This reflected the
              authorities’ efforts to reduce the tax wedge and lower labor cost. These labor market reforms
              might have contributed to stable and increasing employment and this in turn prevented further
              labor market related adverse impacts on the poor and vulnerable. While the attribution of PBG-
              supported reforms is unclear, the official unemployment rate fell slightly from 32.0 percent in
              2010 to 31.4 percent in 2011 and continued to decline into 2012, reaching 30.6 percent in the
              third quarter of that year.

  The overall outcome rating is (i) highly satisfactory (HS) if there are no shortcomings in its relevance, design or
  achievement of objectives; (ii) satisfactory (S) if there are minor shortcomings; (iii) moderately satisfactory (MS)
  if there are moderate shortcomings; (iv) moderately unsatisfactory (MU) if there are significant shortcomings; (v)
  unsatisfactory (U) if there are major shortcomings; and (vi) highly unsatisfactory (HU) if there are severe
  shortcomings.

  These data are based on FYR Macedonian surveys which are comparable over years. The newly introduced SILC,
  which is comparable across European countries, found a poverty rate of 27 percent in 2010. Results from later
  surveys are not yet available.

                                                               15 
 
    


                Declines in the unemployment rate differed by gender. In 2011 women had an activity rate of 44
                 percent compared with 69 percent for men; however, female unemployment fell faster than male.
                 While male unemployment fell from an average rate of 31.8 percent in 2009 to 31.1 percent by
                 the third quarter of 2012, female unemployment fell from 32.9 percent to 29.8 percent over the
                 same period. The unemployment rate is now lower for women than for men.8

                The PBG supported improved targeting of energy subsidies to mitigate the impact of electricity
                 price increases on the poor. Introduced in early 2011, the Program on Subsidizing Energy
                 Consumption increased the amount of the energy poverty transfer from MKD600 to MKD700 per
                 month. The energy poverty transfer is available to the poor and vulnerable, who are eligible for
                 the SFA program. The transfer covers around one third of the average monthly bill of a
                 beneficiary.

        3.5     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

56.     In the course of preparation of this ICR, a stakeholder workshop was held in Skopje on March 13,
2013— attended by the senior-and mid-level officials from the MOF, MOLSP, and the MOH. The
participants were apprised of the objectives and evaluation dimensions, as applied to the PBG. The
workshop provided feedback on: (i) the effectiveness of reforms; (ii) factors that influenced
implementation; and (iii) the importance of results achieved. It also allowed the entire implementation
team of the Government to collectively take stock of the results achieved and prepare for their self-
assessment.


                       4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

57.      Development outcomes are subject to four main risks: (i) external/regional economic risk; (ii)
political risk; (iii) program risks; and (iv) fiduciary risks. In the aggregate, these appear moderate.

58.      External/regional economic risk: The first risk pertains to the evolving external environment.
The uncertainty about the global and in particular the Euro zone economic outlook continues to pose a
significant external risk. Shocks relating to the external environment continue to affect the Macedonian
economy. While past performance is no guarantee of future performance, it is noted that the
Government’s macroeconomic management record has been satisfactory over the last years. The country
has been able to weather the crisis well without major imbalances that would threaten macroeconomic
stability. Nevertheless, the prolonged Euro zone uncertainty is undermining growth prospects. A
continued strong focus on stabilization in the design of macroeconomic policies can preserve stability.
The banking sector is also exposed to external risks, but these are substantially mitigated by strict
regulations of NBRM, which include regulations on lending between subsidiaries and parent banks and a
strengthened deposit insurance framework. The NBRM is also performing semi-annual stress tests
simulating the possible channels of contagion from the negative effects of the Greek and Euro zone crisis
to the domestic banking sector based on different hypothetical scenarios.

59.      Political risks: Political risks are mainly related to the stalling of progress in EU and NATO
integration, as the country’s name issue with Greece is yet to be resolved. Progress in the EU Accession
process and the formal start of EU-membership negotiations sessions served in the past as a powerful
reform anchor. In its recent reports, the European Commission (EC) recommended the immediate start of
accession negotiations for EU-membership. Government has a stable majority and recent local elections
from March-April 2013 confirmed the leading role of the ruling coalition. However, during events before
the local election political tensions between the ruling party VMRO-DPMNE and the opposition party
SDSM resurfaced. As a result the opposition threatened to boycott the local elections and called for early
parliamentary elections. Following high-level interventions from EU, there was an agreement to continue
with the local election process and discuss options later in 2013 to call early parliamentary elections
before the regular schedule in 2014. This could lead to politically motivated expenditure increases and

add to existing fiscal pressures with the risk of re-emerging payment arrears.

60.      Program risks: The risk of a slowdown in the implementation or reversal of reforms appears
unlikely in the foreseeable future, given the Government’s strong track record. Program risks could also
result from other factors such as an economic slowdown and a delay in the EU accession agenda (see
above). Further, there remains a residual risk related to implementation capacity. Implementation capacity
of some public sector institutions, while much improved over the past few years, remains stretched.

61.     Fiduciary risks: In the past, considerable progress was made on Public Financial Management
(PFM) at national and sub-national levels, with FYR Macedonia comparing favorably to other countries in
the region on a number of PFM aspects, notably in external audit and procurement administration.
However, recent economic challenges have put pressure on PFM practices. Further strengthening is
warranted in some areas, especially commitment controls, which are important for controlling and
preventing budgetary expenditure arrears. The medium-term fiscal planning process is another area that
would benefit from further strengthening. To identify ways to mitigate these and other PFM related risks,
the World Bank is planning to carry out a Public Finance Review.


                       5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

              5.1 Bank Performance

        (a)       Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

62.     Overall, the World Bank’s performance was satisfactory. Strong efforts were made by the Bank
team to design a robust program, based on available analytical work. The PBG program was: (i) aligned
with Government’s reform program; (ii) consistent with the higher level objectives of the CPS; and (iii)
generally focused on key reform areas.

        (b)       Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

63.     Supervision of the PBG was continuous, as the Task Team Leader (TTL) and several sector
experts resided in the country. Periodically, when other missions visited Skopje, reform progress was
formally monitored. Based on the ongoing supervision findings, one Implementation Status and Results
Report (ISR) was filed by the TTL, which indicated satisfactory implementation. The overall quality of
supervision is rated satisfactory.

        (c)       Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

64.      The overall rating of Bank performance is rated as satisfactory. Performance with respect to the
quality at entry is rated satisfactory and performance of supervision is also rated as satisfactory. Despite
considerable challenges, beyond the control of the Bank and the Government (mainly related to the
volatile external environment), the PBG (and the preceding DPL1) were delivered timely. The authorities,
and other development partners and stakeholders, were of the view that the Bank’s performance was
satisfactory and acknowledged the close cooperation of the task team with all stakeholders.


                                                    18 
 
 


65.      Overall, the PBG as a single-tranche operation, but de facto within a programmatic framework,
reflected good practices and lessons learned from prior lending operations. The reform program supported
by the PBG was underpinned by analytic and diagnostic work, policy engagement by Bank staff, and
policy collaboration with development partners. The program complemented, and was reinforced by,
Bank sectoral investment lending, technical assistance, and the trust fund portfolio.

            5.2 Borrower Performance

      (a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

      (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

66.     Government’s performance is rated as satisfactory, and performance of some of the agencies
(including the Ministry of Finance, the main implementing agency) is rated highly satisfactory (Table 5).

Table 5: Performance Assessment for all Implementing Agencies
 Government/Implementing AgencyPerformance
    MOF                                Highly Satisfactory
    MOLSP                              Satisfactory
    NBRM                               Highly Satisfactory
    MOH                                Satisfactory

     (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

67.      Several aspects lead to the assessment of satisfactory performance of the Borrower. They relate
mainly to the strong leadership of the Ministry of Finance, the Government ownership of reforms, and the
readiness and discipline to follow through with the implementation, even in difficult circumstances. This
is reflected in outcomes achieved under this program and the overall success of the PBG, as perceived by
other development partners and the commercial lenders involved.

68.      Strong leadership and high level of professionalism in the Ministry of Finance. The main
implementation burden was borne by a small team based in the Ministry of Finance. Under strong
leadership of the Minister of Finance the dedicated team implemented the PBG, which entailed the
implementation of reforms as well as initiating, negotiating and closing the transaction with the
commercial lender. Feedback of commercial lenders indicates their high level of comfort with Ministry of
Finance staff. The PBG was processed in a very short time and the transaction was closed to the
satisfaction of all parties involved.

69.     Government ownership and commitment to achieving development objectives. The Government
was committed to implementing the reform program supported by the PBG. There have been no policy
reversals to date. Looking forward, the risks to development outcomes appear moderate. Since the closure
of the PBG, a second PBG, the Public Expenditure PBG was approved and is being implemented,
continuing key reforms.

                                        6.     Lessons Learned

           (a) Bank-wide lessons

70.      The PBG instrument proved to be a successful instrument for leveraging additional resources for
the client. FYR Macedonia would have been unable to raise a loan of this size without the PBG. Due to its
improved leverage of Bank assets, the PBG is a viable and potentially more powerful policy-based
financing tool than a DPL. The alternative of two transactions involving a World Bank loan and separate
unsecured market borrowing would have posed a high risk to FYR Macedonia in current market
conditions and separate unsecured market borrowing might have not materialized under acceptable terms.
The experience of these operations in the region thus far has demonstrated that through competitive
bidding, the pricing of the combined transaction resulted in an overall cost that was equal to or marginally
better than the costs associated with the two separate transactions noted previously.

71.       The PBG has proven to be a useful instrument, in particular with the current incentive structure
(that is, it does not count 1:1 but 1:4 against exposure). However, even without this specific incentive, it
would be able to leverage additional external resources through the commercial bank market. The
instrument might be of particular benefit to smaller countries, for which the leveraging ability of this
instrument might be of higher importance than for bigger ones.

72.     The program permitted adequate flexibility to account for responses to changing circumstances,
especially during times of crisis. This was the case for the reform program supported by the PBG, when
social sector related actions were added. It allowed for a successful adaptation of a programmatic DPL,
while continuing the ongoing policy dialogue and the reform program. This also contributed to a timely
processing and delivery of the PBG, within less than half a year. Also, the flexibility of converting DPL2
to a PBG responded to the client’s needs at the time.

           (b) Operation-specific

73.     The PBG focused on areas of strategic relevance where the Bank had a record of engagement and
technical capacity. The PBG had a strong analytical foundation that provided the necessary rationale for
selection of policy and program reform areas.

74.     By engaging sector specialists early and throughout the process, the PBG strengthened capacity of
sector ministries and supported their presentation of needs and priorities during policy discussions and
budget negotiations.

75.       Another lesson from the PBG is that wherever possible, the results framework should focus only
on indicators that are within the authorities’ control. Also, in order to allow a better assessment of the
results, it should be always ensured that indicators include targeted achievement time periods and baseline
values are provided, which were not always defined at design stage for the PBG.

In the course of preparation of this ICR, a stakeholder workshop was convened in Skopje on March 13,
2013 — attended by senior and mid-level officials from MOF, MOLSP, and MOH. The participants were
informed about the objectives and evaluation dimensions of self-evaluation, as applied to the PBG. This
workshop provided feedback on: (i) the effectiveness of reforms; (ii) factors that influenced
implementation; and (iii) the importance of the results achieved. It also allowed the entire implementation
team on the Government side to collectively take stock of the results achieved and prepare for their self-
assessment. The discussions during the workshop provided the Bank team with very valuable insights
into the evolution of the reforms and the results achieved for which the team is very thankful.

    1. Context

    The main goals of the reforms undertaken by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia with the
    Policy Based Guarantee (PBG) were to promote sustainability of public finances and the resilience of
    the financial sector. We also wanted to ensure adequate support to the most vulnerable groups, and we
    planned to achieve this through measures that would increase the effectiveness of the social safety net
    and enhance incentives for formal labor market participation.

    The PBG program design was relevant to the development priorities of our country. The Guarantee
    continued and broadened the Bank support to our Government reform program provided under the First
    Development Policy Lending (DPL1). The implementation arrangements for the PBG were effective.
    In 2011, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia requested the PBG instrument instead of
    preparing the Second Development Policy Lending (DPL2) operation in the amount of US$50 million.
    We preferred the PBG instrument over DPL2 for the following reasons: first, although Macedonia’s
    macroeconomic situation had stabilized and the financial system had weathered the crisis well, being a
    small country with some neighbouring economies in severe financial difficulties, the Republic of
    Macedonia faced financial market access challenges. The use of an IBRD guarantee was envisioned to
    help the Government of the Republic of Macedonia to improve its access to international financial
    markets at lower cost and longer maturities. Second, given that access was an issue and Macedonia’s
    financing needs were high, the PBG allowed the Republic of Macedonia to access larger amounts of
    financing compared to the alternative of US$50 million DPL. Third, the PBG was an opportunity to
    expand the investor base on relatively favourable terms and was expected to have positive spill over
    effects for corporate borrowers.

    2. Reform Program

    The reform program, which formed the basis of our cooperation with the World Bank for the PBG,
    contained public expenditure reforms, reforms of social safety nets to support the most vulnerable, and
    reforms to preserve financial sector stability. Under this reform program of the Government of Republic
    of Macedonia, we fulfilled all measures required before PBG approval by the World Bank Board of
    Executive Directors on November 10, 2012. As a result, we believe that overall program objectives and
    targets were met — in particular, maintaining sustainability of public finances and functioning of labor
    markets — and significant progress was made by strengthening social safety nets and resilience of the
    financial sector. The following sections describe the reforms we undertook with respect to the three
    program pillars.

            2.1   Public Expenditure Reforms

    Objective of this pillar was to strengthen the sustainability of public finances and the functioning of
    labor markets. This was achieved by implementing prudent fiscal policy in support of macroeconomic
    stability, as well as by implementing measures to improve public expenditure outcomes. Also,
    significant progress was achieved by enhancing the legal framework in key sectors where the bulk of
    public expenditure occurs.

    Policy measures implemented for PBG were the following:

             The Member Country, by enacting the Law on Amendments to the Law on Payment of Wages
              of July 20, 2010 (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia–OGRM--, no. 97/2010) froze
              nominal Government wages until September 2012.
             The Member Country, by enacting the Law on Amendments to the Law on Compulsory Social
              Insurance Contributions (OGRM 156/2009) reduced the social insurance contribution rates; and
              by enacting the Law on Amendments to the Law on Pension and Disability Insurance (OGRM

                                                    25 
 
 
            156/2009 and 156/2010), reduced pension expenditures through reduced valorization
            coefficients and tightened eligibility criteria for survivor pensions.
           The Member Country, by enacting the Law on Amendments to the Law on Compulsory Social
            Insurance Contributions (OGRM 53/2010) de-linked the provision of free health insurance to
            registration as unemployed and introduced an income-based test for provision of free health
            insurance.
           The Member Country adopted a program to improve efficiency and sustainability of the health
            sector.
           Health Insurance Fund adopted by-laws and a rulebook regulating the operations of the new
            Health Single Treasury Account covering all public health institutions.

    The main expected outcome was to ensure sustainability of public finances of the Republic of
    Macedonia. During the past years, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia continued to
    implement public expenditure policies supportive of both macroeconomic stability and acceleration of
    economic activity. In addition to disciplined fiscal policy, the Government froze nominal Government
    wages until December 2013. Keeping the wage bill moderate was a key component of Government’s
    strategy to improve competitiveness. Funds intended for salaries accounted for 24.2 percent in 2011 and
    24.1 percent in 2012 of the revenues in the Republic of Macedonia. In line with the existing Law on
    Payment of Wages, an increase in salaries by five percent is planned for the December salary 2013.

    Government has improved control over pension expenditures by adopting amendments of the Law on
    Pension and Disability Insurance (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia, no. 156/2009) which
    reduced the valorization coefficient (which adjusts the salaries of previous years for determining the
    amount of pension), thus having a cost-reducing effect on the pension system. Additionally, the
    conditions for exercising the right to survival pension will be the same for both men and women.
    Pension spending for 2011 and 2012 was maintained at 7.7 percent of GDP.

    With the adoption of the Law on Modifications and the Amendments of the Law on Compulsory Social
    Insurance Contributions (OGRM no. 53/11), the right to mandatory health insurance and requirements
    for registration as an unemployed person for acquiring that right were separated. For joining mandatory
    health insurance it is no longer required to register as an unemployed person, but rather the income the
    person realized in the previous year. Based on the income, it is determined whether the person realizes
    sufficient revenues and whether he/she may himself/herself pay the health insurance contribution or the
    MOH will pay this contribution on his/her behalf.

    As a result of the above-mentioned amendments to the Law on Compulsory Social Insurance
    Contributions, the number of registered unemployed persons dropped significantly. Amendments to the
    Law commenced to be applied as of September 2011. In August 2011, the number of registered
    unemployed persons at the Employment Agency of the Republic of Macedonia amounted to 303,906
    persons. As a result of separating the right to health insurance and the requirement for registration as an
    unemployed person, the number of unemployed persons shrank to 243,403 in December 2012, dropping
    by 60,503 persons. As a result of the implementation of the above-mentioned Laws, the number of
    formal workers with paid social insurance contributions increased from 407,887 in 2009 to 467,609 for
    the period January-September 2012.

    Government has undertaken a number of reforms in the health sector. The Health Insurance Fund of the
    Republic of Macedonia (HIF) no longer pays ‘non-medical costs.’ In fact, maternity leave allowance is
    borne by the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy (MOLSP), and it is paid through the HIF. Use of
    expensive diagnostic procedures has been rationalized to reduce ‘overuse.’ The MOH has published a
    protocol on the use of x-ray equipment, computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging,
    containing the precise health conditions for which patients should be given a referral and by whom.

                                                     26 
 
 
    Electronic waiting lists have been introduced, which established order in the system, by chronology and
    urgency (medical triage). In addition, they enable patients who do not want to be on the waiting list and
    want to have the services provided earlier, to pay for the services themselves rather than through the
    HIF.

    The amount of arrears to public health institutions was limited and did not exceed MKD 1.7 billion
    during 2011 and 2012. Also, during 2011, HIF published the financial statements of public health
    institutions regularly (that is, monthly) and it is a continuous practice.

    By launching the Treasury System in the HIF (from January 1, 2011), an integrated, secured and
    transparent payment controlling system was established arising from the need for efficient and effective
    allocation of financial resources raised through compulsory health insurance contributions. By
    implementing the Treasury System, HIF improved its reporting function as it has now accurate daily
    information about the cash flow of each Public Health Care Institution (PHCI) and overall control of the
    purpose of its expenditures. Furthermore, with the consolidation of health care financial resources and
    the centralization of payments, HIF enhanced its own liquidity, as well as PHCIs’ liquidity. This was
    achieved through better cash management and by providing financial resources where they are most
    needed. Consequently, under the Health Care Treasury Single Account (an account through which all
    PHCIs’ revenues are collected and all payment transactions are performed), there is a better allocation
    of health care financial resources. Another essential fact is that, with the implementation of the Treasury
    System, PHCIs have generated estimated savings from bank commissions for payment transactions (in
    the amount of EUR70,000 to EUR180,000) and also around EUR20,000 from other commissions,
    which were allocated for financing other priorities and purposes.

    Under this project, HIF was the first public institution in the Republic of Macedonia that implemented
    e-banking, which had been already implemented in the commercial banks. Thus, there is a possibility
    for electronic submission of PHCIs’ payment requests signed with digital signatures instead of
    submitting them at HIF branch offices, which generates additional financial savings for PHCIs
    (estimated at around MKD 2,000,000 per year). With this modernization, HIF will also acquire some
    benefits, such as reallocation of operating assets and human resources to other projects.

    Some of the achieved goals and objectives with the implementation of the Treasury System are the
    following:

              Better liquidity management of HIF funds for the public health care system.
              Daily insight into actual expenditures.
              Daily recording of all PHCIs’ revenues and expenditures (i.e. the financial position of PHCIs).
              Effective use of public resources and no idle balances.
              Savings for PHCIs on bank commissions, which are paid by the HIF.
              Better financial planning and decision-making process within PHCIs’ top management for
               expenditure control.

         2.2       Reforming Social Safety Nets to Support the Most Vulnerable

    The objective of the second pillar was strengthening of social safety nets. Reforming the social safety
    net and improving its administration, as well as supporting the vulnerable groups achieved this.
    Policy measures implemented for the PBG were the following:

              Ministry of Labor and Social Policy developed functional Cash Benefits Management
               Information System (CBMIS) to testing stage, and established a network between Social

                                                      27 
 
 
            Welfare Centers and Ministry of Labor and Social Policy.
           The Member Country, by adopting the Program on Subsidizing Energy Consumption in 2011
            (OGRM 6/2011), introduced a mechanism for providing support to the poor and vulnerable
            against electricity prices increases.

    Government committed to improve the social safety net administration and further improve the
    protection of vulnerable groups. In order to achieve this goal, the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy
    developed a new CBMIS. To assure the security requirements of the system, a virtual private network
    was established between the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy and the Social Welfare Centres
    (SWCs), which enables the functioning of CBMIS. This type of network provides security in the
    operations with confidential data, and access to the system is enabled from the locations of social
    welfare centres, as well as the location of the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy.

    Ministry of Labor and Social Policy is considering the possibilities for further interconnection with
    other institutions. At this moment, although web services with the Ministry of Interior, Public Revenue
    Office and Agency for Financial Support of Agriculture and Rural Development do not exist, relevant
    beneficiary data is being exchanged at the central level and disseminated to the appropriate SWCs.

    For the purposes of administration of the Conditional Cash Transfer Program for Secondary Education,
    the MOLSP provided secure access to the CBMIS for secondary schools of the Republic of Macedonia,
    through a virtual private network client. As a result, school officials can enter the attendance data
    directly into the system for the administration of cash benefits. Access to this part of the system is
    enabled only from secondary school locations, that is, it is available only to the previously assigned
    coordinators. Currently, the following cash benefits are administrated through the CBMIS: (i) Social
    Financial Assistance; (ii) Civil Disability; (iii) Permanent Assistance (18-26); (iv) Conditional Cash
    Transfers for Secondary Education; (v) Child Allowance; (vi) Energy Poverty Support; (vii) Blindness
    and Mobility Benefit; (viii) Financial Reimbursement for Assistance and Care; (ix) Special Allowance;
    (x) Foster Family; and (xi) Equalization Allowance for Care of a Disabled Child. The remaining
    benefits are expected to begin to be administrated through CBMIS in the next couple of months. It is
    important to note that benefits currently administrated through CBMIS are the most complex benefits
    and, at the same time, the benefits with the highest number of beneficiaries.

    In terms of processing time of Social Financial Assistance (SFA), there has been a change in the Law on
    Social Financial Assistance in 2011 (OGRM no. 51/2011) according to which the processing time of the
    application for SFA is extended from 30 to 60 days, but the Law also provides sanctions for delays in
    the processing of SFA. In 2012, the average processing time for new applications for SFA benefits was
    19 days. Average processing time for SFA for the existing beneficiary households, which registered
    change in their households, was 13 days. 2012 was the year of software start-up. This means that the
    vast task of data entry, training and repairs of possible software deficiencies directly influenced the file
    processing time.

    Also, as a result of growing energy prices, Government has provided support to the poor and vulnerable
    against electricity price increases by adopting the Program on Subsidizing Energy Consumption. This
    program was introduced in 2011 as a top-up on the amount of SFA recipients benefiting from the
    satisfactory targeting results achieved through SFA over time. The program includes around 9,300
    payments per month. The number of payments varies monthly, since the program allows for the
    beneficiary to submit all receipts at once during one calendar year to receive reimbursements for bills
    already paid. According to the HBS, which is conducted every year by the State Statistical Office of the
    Republic of Macedonia, the percentage of cash benefits going to the poorest quintile was 37.44 percent
    in 2009. In 2011, the percentage of cash benefits intended for the poorest quintile was 34.51 percent.

       2.3      Preserving Financial Sector Stability

    The objective of pillar 3 was to strengthen the resilience of the financial sector. This was achieved by
    adopting new regulations, which contributed to increasing the financial crisis preparedness in the
    Republic of Macedonia, as well as strengthening the banking system.
    Policy measures implemented for the PBG were the following:

             The Borrower, by enacting the National Bank of Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) Law (OGRM
              158/2010), increased accountability and independence of the Central Bank to EU standards.
             The Borrower established Financial Stability Committee (FSC) and FSC adopted rules of
              procedure for its operations.

    Taking into consideration the importance of a sound financial system for overall economic stability, the
    Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia enacted the new Law on NBRM, which has increased its
    accountability and independence in line with the EU standards, both in terms of status and functions of
    the NBRM. The NBRM has full:

       - functional independence and a clearly defined main objective,
       - institutional independence (where all possible sources of influence from the executive and
          legislature, local self-government, public sector, receiving and requesting instructions,
          suspensions, revocations, and approval of decisions are banned),
       - personal independence (i.e. follows defined selection procedure, duration of the mandate,
          professional qualifications, and conditions for revocation), and
       - financial independence (with its budget and annual accounts are independently adopted by the
          highest authority – the Council, not being subject-matter of approval by other bodies, allocation of
          profits is governed by law). In addition, provisions on prohibition of monetary financing and
          providing privileged access to financial institutions are effective.

    In line with EU regulations, the Financial Stability Committee was established, governed by a
    Memorandum of Understanding for maintenance of financial stability and financial crisis management.
    The first session of the Committee was held on September 1, 2011, when Rules of Procedure were
    adopted. At the regular quarterly meetings of the Committee, most recent trends in the banking sector
    are reviewed, being seen through the so-called Financial Soundness Indicators. These indicators are
    determined on the basis of IMF methodology applied by the NBRM. Other issues are also considered at
    the meetings, such as the need for changes in the regulations, effects from the regulations and other
    factors on financial stability, etc. Representatives from the MOF and the NBRM are members in the
    Committee. DIF representatives do not participate in the Committee regularly; however, representatives
    from the DIF can be invited to the meetings. In line with the Memorandum, the Committee informs the
    DIF on the joint assessments of the financial stability. In addition, the Management Board of the Fund
    has representatives from the Ministry of Finance and the NBRM among its members, providing for
    regular communication between the representatives of the three institutions for all issues of mutual
    significance.

    3. Assessment of Government and Bank Performance

        3.1       Government Performance

    Government put a legal and institutional framework in place to improve public finances and functioning
    of labor markets, straightening social safety nets and the resilience of the financial sector. All prior
    actions were completed on time and Government is continuing to build capacity to implement reforms
    with the help of a number of investment projects. The Ministry of Finance was a committed counterpart

                                                        29 
 
 
    and its coordination department was highly effective in working with the relevant institutions, all of
    which were fully dedicated to fulfilling PBG actions and expected results. Implementing institutions
    performed very well: they followed through with agreed program reforms and handled the challenge of
    preparing substantial amounts of new legislation.

        3.2      World Bank Performance

    The Bank cooperated closely with the Ministry of Finance and cooperated effectively with the other
    counterparts (MOH, MOLSP, HIF, and NBRM). The Bank developed this operation using its solid
    knowledge and experience gained through working closely with the Government on the preceding series
    of budget support operations over 2005-2008 – Programmatic Development Policy Loans (PDPL 1, 2
    and 3), DPL 1 in 2011 and through extensive analytical work in areas covered by this operation.

    Government appreciates the strong support and efforts the World Bank exercised, especially by ensuring
    that the above-mentioned reforms would be strengthened with ongoing investment loans in different
    sectors in order to achieve the economic reform program of the Government of the Republic of
    Macedonia. Government expresses its utmost appreciation for the overall cooperation with the World
    Bank and is convinced that the World Bank will continue to be a reliable partner in the long run.

    4. Lessons Learned

    The Guarantee instrument was implemented in our country for the first time. The Government of the
    Republic of Macedonia is satisfied with the outcome. The Guarantee from the World Bank was in the
    amount of EUR100 million. We succeeded in securing a loan in the amount of EUR130 million on the
    international capital market from Citi Bank and Deutsche Bank AG under favourable terms.

    This instrument contributed to improving the performance of the Republic of Macedonia on raising
    funds on the international capital market independently. As a result of the successful implementation of
    the first PBG, in 2012, Republic of Macedonia secured funds on the international capital market in the
    amount of EUR75 million, by borrowing from Deutsche Bank AG in the form of unsecured loan.
    Interest rate was higher than Euribor 500 bp, but it corresponded to the market conditions at the time. As
    a result of the unfavourable conditions on the international capital market, the remaining funds for
    budget financing were secured on the domestic market through issuance of government securities, at a
    price more favourable compared to the price of foreign borrowing.

    Benefits from the use of this instrument contributed to strengthening the position of the Republic of
    Macedonia on the international capital markets and improving the relations with potential investors and
    financial institutions.

    Moreover, having in mind all the positive outcomes and benefits from the first PBG, Republic of
    Macedonia has managed, in a very short period of time, to fulfil the pre-conditions for the second PBG
    Guarantee. The strengthened position of the Republic of Macedonia and its presence on the international
    capital market were once again acknowledged by new borrowing in a form of a loan secured by the
    second Guarantee from the World Bank, being in a larger amount than the first one (EUR250 million),
    longer time of maturity (seven years), higher leverage (Bank’s guarantee covered only EUR155 million

The World Bank was successful in using PBG to leverage EUR100 million of the EUR130 million principal
of a commercial loan by Deutsche Bank and Citibank to FYR Macedonia

The task team conducted interviews with the respective team leaders and technical teams of Deutsche Bank
and Citi Bank, the two banks that contracted the commercial loan the Guarantee was approved for. Their
feedback is gratefully acknowledged and contributed to the assessment presented in the main text of the
ICR. The assessment of the representatives of Deutsche Bank and Citi Bank was overall highly positive
and they valued the experience having worked with Government and the Bank on this transaction. Banks
expressed strong support for the instrument. They pointed out that the instrument allowed them to become
familiarized with Macedonia and its Government as a counterpart for a transaction. As the most important
outcome for Macedonia, Banks mentioned the country’s ability to establishing its track record in accessing
the international financial market through the Guarantee at difficult times.

The team also conducted interviews in Macedonia with commercial banks, private sector representatives
and the NBRM Governor and his team on the PBG and the perceived impact. The consensus was that the
PBG provided timely and important support to FYR Macedonia when market access to international capital
was very restricted and otherwise prohibitively expensive. This contributed to sustaining macroeconomic
stability and allowing a positive environment for private sector growth and financial sector stability.

Interviews with the several development partners (EU, USAID and IMF) acknowledged the importance of
the Guarantee instrument to provide the authorities in difficult times with financial market access at
reasonable cost. There was broad support for the PBG reform program.

In interviews with representatives of the opposition party broad support of the World Bank’s program in
FYR Macedonia was pointed out. Despite the moderate public debt level, some concerns were raised in
regard to the increase in public debt levels over recent years.

                         Annex 6. Evolution of the Program from DPL2 to PBG


    The main objective of the PBG supported program remained unchanged to the one supported by the DPL
    series, though the program matrix was slightly redefined to reflect the environment in which the PBG has
    been prepared. As detailed in the table below, one prior action was dropped and four modified.

           The DPL2 trigger on implementation of the 2010 budget was dropped given the requirement of
            OP 8.60 on Development Policy Lending, which stipulates that such lending is undertaken only in
            a satisfactory macroeconomic framework, including an appropriate overall fiscal stance.

           In the case of the public sector wage reform, the original DPL2 trigger was the Government
            adoption of a Law on Public Sector Wages. The tight fiscal constraint and technical requirements
            for drafting such a law delayed further progress in this area and therefore the action was replaced
            by the continuation of a Government nominal wage freeze and tight public sector employment
            control. In addition, the public sector wage reform remains part of the Government’s medium-
            term reform strategy, and its inclusion as an EU accession priority gave assurances that the
            reform would be undertaken over the medium term.

           The wording of the DPL2 trigger to improve the sustainability of the pension system was
            amended to reflect specific measures that were undertaken by the authorities to reduce the costs
            of the system. Given that the measures were prompted by the ongoing payroll reform, the prior
            action was combined with the benchmark on reducing social insurance contributions.

           One DPL2 trigger on health was modified. The revision of the Basic Benefits Package will is
            planned to be done in stages, given the complexity of the task. A detailed actuarial analysis to
            cost the proposed reform informed the policy dialogue with regard to the concrete steps to reform
            the Basic Benefits Package. These were outlined in the roadmap for reform adopted by
            Government and supported by the PBG.

           In the social safety net area, the DPL2 trigger on development of the CBMIS was amended but
            only to reflect the fact that the full system were not completed by the time the PBG was
            negotiated. Still, the operation continued to support the development of the critical modules of
            CBMIS that will result in improved budget planning and execution, financial reporting and
            administration MOLSP and SWCs as well as improved administration for a significant part of
            social spending. The support provided by an ongoing Bank investment loan provided assurances
            that the reform was being fulfilled.

    There was agreement to add three new PBG prior actions, aimed at ensuring that the program remained
    strong and the objectives were met:

           A new prior action, which de-linked the provision of free health insurance from the status of
            unemployed, was added. This removed a significant distortion in the functioning of the labor
            market and control health spending, while ensuring that the most vulnerable remained covered.

           A new prior action on the introduction of an energy poverty program was added. The authorities
            introduced an energy poverty program to mitigate the impact of gradually increasing energy
            prices as a result of market liberalization.

           In the financial sector, the establishment of the Financial Stability Committee, which was initially
            envisaged as a benchmark for DPL2, became a prior action.

    Table A6.1 provides a comparison to the DPL2 prior actions envisaged at the time of preparation of the
    initial DPL1 operation and the PBG prior actions.

                                       Annex 7. Achievements of the PBG
     
    The PBG covered over half of the fiscal deficit in 2011. The fiscal deficit reached EUR190 million or
    2.5 percent of GDP in 2011. The Government used the PBG to borrow EUR130 million in December
    2011, covering over half of the fiscal deficit at a reasonable cost (4.3 percent interest rate). Despite being
    so large, the PBG does not appear to have had a disruptive impact on the financial sector, and may even
    have helped to ‘crowd in’ domestic credit as it was sourced externally. As well as being instrumental in
    financing the deficit, the PBG allowed the Government to maintain their financial reserves at a
    comfortable level during 2012 and may have made it easier to issue domestic bonds (including using
    foreign currency clauses to protect the purchaser against currency depreciation). Finally, because it was
    externally sourced, the PBG enabled the authorities to maintain foreign reserves at adequate levels, thus
    helping to maintain the exchange rate peg in a volatile economic environment.

    Macroeconomic Impact of the PBG

    The externally-financed PBG could have impacted several key macroeconomic variables. In
    particular, the inflow worth around 1.3 percent of GDP may have affected the exchange rate, stock
    exchange, foreign reserves, credit growth, and interest rates. However, comparing these variables over
    time and with those of other countries in the region suggests that the PBG had very little disruptive
    impact. This is likely to be because the PBG displaced more expensive deficit financing rather than
    generating additional flows.

    The PBG does not appear to have impacted the exchange rate despite the large capital inflow. The
    FYR Macedonian denar maintained a stable exchange rate against the Euro during the preparation of the
    PBG and after the transaction had taken place in December 2011 (Figure A7.1). Indeed among non-
    euroized, non-currency board countries, the denar is the most stable currency vis-à-vis the Euro,
    fluctuating only within a very narrow band around 61.4 to the Euro. A solid commitment to maintain the
    value of the denar as well as stable inflation and reasonable foreign reserves contributed to minimizing
    both upward and downward pressure on the currency.

    The PBG helped the Government to source external funding, which may otherwise have been
    obtained domestically with impacts on credit growth and the stock market. Banking sector
    representatives reported a preference for investing in short-term financial instruments including T-Bills
    and C-Bills for a maximum term of one year. Although some domestic banks may have considered a five-
    year bond to the Government9, there were fears that Government’s recourse to long-term domestic
    financing may have placed domestic banks’ liquidity under pressure, and would have crowded out credit
    growth. The banks therefore expressed a preference that the government would seek long-term financing
    externally. The PBG may have reduced the risk of such crowding out. Annual nominal credit growth in
    FYR Macedonia remained flat but positive since the mid-2010 at around 7.5 percent (Figure A7.2). This
    was around average for comparator countries. In addition, there is no evidence that credit growth was hit
    by the PBG. At the time of the PBG disbursement the stock market index was around 20 percent lower
    than one year previously and had been falling for six months (Figure A7.3). The fall was mirrored by
    those in comparator countries and was largely a result of a generalized loss of economic confidence and
    capital withdrawals or slower capital inflows into emerging markets. The stock market ‘bottomed out’
    after the PBG, but this cannot be attributed to the operation as other countries had similar experiences
    thanks, in part to the introduction of the European Central Bank (ECB) Long Term Refinancing Options
    (LTROs).

    Not surprisingly, foreign reserves peaked following the PBG transaction. The PBG transaction
    temporarily increased foreign reserve holdings compared with the same time during the previous year.
    They rose from around 10 percent higher than 2011 levels to 20 percent higher. The foreign reserves
    holdings then remained above 2011 levels throughout 2012. This is in contrast to reserve holdings of
    comparator countries, which were on a declining trajectory at the time of the PBG disbursement and most
    remained below 2011 levels for the better part of 2012. This suggests that the PBG may have made it
    easier to hold foreign reserves rather than dip into them to finance the deficit. However, given the
    commitment to the exchange rate ‘peg’, the authorities are likely to choose to maintain adequate foreign
    reserves in any case.

    Discussions with representatives of the banking sector suggest that they attach a high importance to
    foreign reserve holdings. Foreign reserve holdings are viewed as both an indicator and a guarantor of
    economic stability by the sector. Sufficient foreign reserves confirm sufficient liquidity in the system
    (deposited with the NBRM) and in part reflect access to finance for both the public and private sectors. In
    addition, sufficient foreign reserves ensure the viability of maintaining the exchange rate peg, helping to
    safeguard the macroeconomic stability for business planning. The positive impact of the PBG on foreign
    reserves was therefore broadly welcomed by the banking sector.

    Access to Financing in 2012

    CDS spreads came down following the PBG operation but so did those of other comparator
    countries. FYR Macedonian CDS spreads hit a peak of around 650 basis points (bps) in December 2011,
    at around the same time the PBG disbursed (Figure 7A.5). They fell rapidly following the PBG, by
    around 150 bps in just three months and for a short period actually fell to below 500 bps in March 2012.
    However, at around the same time, the CDS spreads of comparator countries, notably Albania and
    Montenegro, also fell rapidly. The falls are likely to have more to do with the ECB announcement in
    December 2011 that it would make cheap long-term financing available to domestic commercial banks.10
    Thanks partly to the decline in CDS spreads the Government was able to borrow EUR75 million on
    international markets for a period of five years with a spread of 533 bps above Euribor.

    Financing the Deficit

    The PBG operation may have either encouraged or made it easier for the FYR Macedonian
    authorities to tap the financial markets for longer-term financing. In conjunction with PBG, the
    authorities were pursuing other financing options at attractive interest rates. At the end of September
    2011, the Treasury issued its first bond for over two and a half years. In addition, at 5.5 percent it
    attracted the lowest interest rate since the end of 2007. The bonds issued between September and
    December 2011 actually occurred prior to the turning point in CDS spreads, which plateaued in January
    2012 for FYR Macedonia. The Government reports that it chose to go to the market at this moment both
    to assess the financial markets’ reaction to the bond issuances and to raise financing in case the PBG did
    not work out as planned. The PBG, for which discussions were ongoing in September 2011, may have
    provided additional leverage for the Government to issue bonds, or these may have been issued even
    without the PBG. Even without the PBG, the Government had sufficient reserves to finance the deficit in
    the short term but this would have meant running down its bank balance at a time of high economic
    uncertainty.

           ECB announced in December 2011 that LTROs would be made available at one percent interest, three-year
         terms and using banks’ portfolios as collateral.

                                                                   38 
     
     
    With the PBG, the Government had sufficient reserves to finance the fiscal deficit in 2011 without
    issuing bonds but it would have reduced its financial reserves. The increased deficit in 2011 compared
    with 2010 (Figure A7.6) increased the Government’s financing needs compared with the previous year.
    However, when the first bonds of 2011 were issued in September, overnight deposits held reserves equal
    to 2.8 percent of GDP or 13.3 months of deficit. These reserves combined with the PBG, which amounted
    to over half of the EUR190 million (2.5 percent of GDP) deficit in 2011, would have been sufficient to
    finance the fiscal deficit. Given this, it is possible that the PBG allowed or encouraged the Government to
    issue longer-term debt to prevent drawing down on financial reserves. The Government continued to issue
    three and five year bonds during 2012 and Government deposits therefore climbed during 2012, reaching
    6.6 percent of GDP by December 2012, up from 4.1 percent in December 2011, despite the increased
    deficit.

    On the back of the PBG and successful bond issuances toward the end of 2011, the Government
    continued to access the financial markets with good conditions throughout 2012, including with
    foreign currency clauses. A total of 29 three and five year bond issuances (including re-openings) were
    undertaken in 2012 compared with four in 2011 (Table A7.1). All of these bonds were issued to FYR
    Macedonian residents (none to non-residents). The terms improved slightly too with an average interest
    rate of 5.4 percent in 2012. Of the 29 bond-issuances, 19 had a foreign currency clause (always in euro),
    designed to protect the holder against the risk of depreciation. Discussions with the banking sector
    indicate that they view the issuance of long-term bonds with foreign currency clauses as a clear signal of
    the Government’s intention to maintain the exchange rate peg. Bonds including a foreign currency clause
    attracted an average interest rate of 5.4 percent versus 5.7 percent for those that did not. The small
    premium (about five percent) paid for holding denar-denominated debt reflects the stability of the
    exchange rate and the very small perceived risk of depreciation vis-à-vis the euro over the medium term.

    In addition to raising financing on the domestic market (including through issuing bonds with
    foreign currency clauses), the Government accessed the international financial market through a
    loan. In June 2012, the Parliament approved a EUR75 million loan from Deutsche Bank to help finance
    the deficit. This five-year loan was provided with an interest rate of 6.5 percent and a spread of 533 bps
    above Euribor. As with the rate on domestic bonds, this represented a significant improvement in the cost
    of financing but failed by a very small margin to meet the PBG target spread of Euribor 500 bps.

    Despite the ability to access international financial markets throughout 2012, financing the deficit
    became a challenge in mid-2012. After being contained during the first half of the year, the fiscal deficit
    increased substantially above 2010 and 2011 levels from mid-2012(Figure A7.6) due to the poor
    economic climate, which hit revenues (notably VAT), and due to efforts to pay arrears, which had
    accumulated during the crisis. At the same time, Government financial reserves began to dwindle (Figure
    A7.6). Under such conditions, it was not clear whether access to financial markets would be maintained.
    Preparation for a second PBG therefore began in this context.
