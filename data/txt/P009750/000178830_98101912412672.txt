RAMAGUNDAM THERMAL POWER PROJECT
1. THE POWER SECTOR
Background
1.01      Planning for power in India has, in the past, been on a State-wise
basis, although during more recent years, a start has been made to coordinate
planning on a regional basis with inter-State transfers of power. However,
the sheer size and increasing complexity of India's power sector, as well as
economic considerations, entail the construction of ever larger power stations
and extra high voltage transmission lines. This in turn necessitates an
increasingly sophisticated approach to power planning to ensure that systems
are expanded in the national context to meet developing demand on the most
efficient basis.
1.02      The Government of India (GOI) recognizes the problems, and its
strategy envisages increasing centralized planning of generation and trans-
mission projects and, ultimately, centralized control of a national grid
with the operation of generating plant on a merit order basis. Actions taken
by GOI to date in implementing this policy are the formation of the National
Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and the National Hydro Power Corporation
(NHPC) to construct and operate large thermal and hydro power stations and
associated transmission, and the engagement of consultants to assist the
Central Electricity Authority (CEA) in the formulation of a national power
plan which includes a 400 kV system study to determine the configuration and
parameters of the future interconnected national power system. The decision
to proceed with the construction and commissioning of several large thermal
power stations of 1,600 MW to 2,100 MW capacity, located on coal fields and
supplying bulk power to the States via an interconnected 400 kV transmission
system, is another move in this direction. The construction of two such
developments, the 2,000 MW Singrauli and 2,100 MW Korba projects, has been
started, with IDA assisting in financing the first stages of both. In each
case this comprises 600 MW of generating plant and associated transmission
(Credits 685-IN Singrauli and 793-IN Korba). The 2,100 MW Ramagundam devel-
opment, which is the third in this series of developments, is the subject
of this report. As in the cases of Singrauli and Korba, GOI has asked the
Association to assist in financing the first stage of this development
(3 x 200 MW generating units and associated plant and transmission). Bank
Group finance of US$250 million is proposed comprising a Credit of US$200
million and a Loan of US$50 million.
Previous Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
1.03      The Bank has made eight loans to India for power projects amounting
to US$284.5 million and IDA ten credits totalling US$796 million. Of this
amount US$620.5 million has financed or is financing the construction of
generating plants, US$23 million has financed the purchase of construction
equipment for the Beas hydroelectric project, US$380 million was used on
projects for high voltage transmission and US$57 million was for rural



electrification.  Nine loans and credits for generating plant, the Beas
project (Credit 89-IN) and the first three transmission projects (Loan 416-IN,
Credits 242-IN and 377-IN) have been completed. The fourth transmission pro-
ject (Credit 604-IN) is under implementation. Approximately US$94 million
of the credit amount of US$150 million had been committed up to the end of
September 1978. The Korba and Trombay thermal power projects (Credit 783-IN
and Loan 1549-IN) which were approved in April 1978 are still in the preli-
minary implementation stage and no disbursements have yet been made. Commit-
ments to November 30, 1978 totalled US$104 million on the Singrauli project
(Credit 685-IN) and US$55.2 million on the Rural Electrification project
(Credit 572-IN).
1.04      The fourth power transmission project and the rural electrification
project are proceeding satisfactorily notwithstanding initial delays in imple-
mentation and the substantial delay in preparation of specifications for the
more sophisticated load dispatch equipment in the case of the transmission
project.
Energy Resources
1.05      India's main commercial energy resources are coal, oil and natural
gas and hydro power. There are also resources of nuclear fuels, principally
uranium and thorium, and India's power program includes the construction of
further "CANDU" type heavy water reactors using domestically produced natural
uranium as fuel. Two nuclear power stations have been constructed to date
and a third is under construction. Some geothermal energy sites have also
been identified, but the potential appears to be limited.
1.06      Coal is by far the most extensive indigenous fossil fuel; reserves
are estimated at 83 billion tons of which some 21 billion tons have been
proven. Additionally, total reserves of lignite at the Neyveli field in
Tamil Nadu are estimated at around 2 billion tons. If generally unworkable
coal, e.g. coal with high ash and moisture content, is excluded, this estimate
of recoverable and saleable coal and lignite is reduced to approximately
24 billion tons which, on a forecast country-wide usage, would be adequate
for some 50 years under current assumptions of economic growth.
1.07      By comparison with coal, proven reserves of oil in India are present-
ly small. Exploration and drilling activities to date have proven an estimated
230 million tons on shore, and recent new off-shore discoveries west of Bombay
in the Arabian sea have led to delineation of fields with proven recoverable
reserves of about 250 million tons of crude oil and 30 billion cubic meters of
natural gas. Other reserves of natural gas, which is found in India both alone
and in association with crude oil, are estimated at over 100 billion cubic
meters.
1.08      The potential of hydro-electric power resources is estimated at
41,000 MW of which some 10,000 MW has already been developed. Some 30% is in
the North Eastern region with the balance spread over the Northern (25%),
Southern (20%), Western (18%), and Eastern (7%) regions.



- 3 -
1.09      Oil and natural gas have important alternative uses and it is
improbable they will be a significant factor in the generation of electric
power. Development of generating facilities for the foreseeable future,
therefore, will be based on coal or lignite burning thermal stations and
hydroelectric power stations with a small but gradually developing nuclear
program.
The Power Sector
1.10      Under the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, power supply is a concur-
rent subject, meaning that legal responsibility is shared bptween the Central
Government and State Governments. The principal agencies in the industry ares
(1) the State Electricity Boards (SEBs); (2) the Atomic Energy Commission;
(3) the Central Electricity Authority (CEA); and (4) the two Central Power
Corporations (NTPC and NHPC).
1.11      The SEBs are constituted by the State Governments under the pro-
visions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, to promote the coordinated
development of the generation, supply and distribution of electricity within
their respective States in the most efficient and economical manner, and for
the control and regulation of other supply undertakings which are private
licensees. These comprise municipal utilities such as Bombay Suburban
Electric Supply Undertaking, and private utilities, the largest of which are
Tata Electric Companies Ltd. (Bombay), Calcutta Electric Supply Company, and
Ahmedabad Electric Supply Company. At the present time, the States effectively
own or control well over ninety percent of electricity supply facilities.
Most of the SEBs are financially weak and in some cases unable even to meet
their interest obligations to State Governments. Amendments to the financiaL
provisions of the Act, which were recently enacted, are designed to enable
SEBs to become financially viable to the extent that tariffs can be set to
ensure revenues are sufficient to meet operating expenses including deprecia--
tion, taxes and interest and leave sufficient surplus for amortization of
debt, increases in working capital and to cover a reasonable proportion of
the cost of future construction.
1.12      The financial position of the SEBs has been the subject of con-
tinuing dialogue with GOI, and improvements have been effected through rate
of return covenants in connection with previous Credits. Future missions
dealing with the power sector will continue this dialogue with particular
emphasis on the steps which should be taken to provide a basis for improving
SEB financial and accounting practices, now that the financial amendments to
the Act have been enacted into law. In the meantime GOI has formally noti-
fied the State Governments of the financial amendments to the Act, setting
out their responsibilities in complying with these amendments and asking for
an indication of the actions which are to be taken.
1.13      The CEA was formally created in 1950 with responsibility for develop-
ing a national policy for power development and coordinating the activities
of the various planning agencies involved in electricity supply. At that time
it came under the Power Wing of the Central Water and Power Commission (CWPC)
which in turn was under the the Ministry of Irrigation and Power. As a result
of administrative changes introduced in October 1974, responsibility for power



- 4 -
was transferred to the Ministry of Energy, which was created at that time to
bring together ministerial responsibility for coal and power. This involved
the transfer of the Power Wing of the former CWPC to the CEA, which now comes
under the Department of Power of the Ministry of Energy and is responsible
for developing a sound national policy for the electricity supply industry.
The Department of Atomic Energy, which comes directly under the Prime Minister,
is responsible for nuclear power generation.
1.14      CEA's powers were enlarged through amendments to the Electricity
(Supply) Act, 1948, which were enacted into law on November 30, 1976. In addi-
tion to its general responsibilities for national power policies, it is now
responsible for the formulation and coordination of plans for power develop-
ment, optimization of investments in the power sector in the country, devel-
opment of interconnected system operation, training of personnel and research
and development. It includes specialist engineering organizations which pro-
vide comprehensive project engineering services to the electricity supply
industry. The Thermal Department also takes rsponsibility for monitoring the
performance and maintenance records of thermal power stations and for organiz-
ing the training of power station personnel.
1.15      The SEBs and the other licensed electricity undertakings are re-
quired to submit their investment proposals to the CEA for technical and
economic appraisal and to the Energy Division of the Planning Commission for
inclusion in the plan. The Planning Commission is responsible for the allo-
cation of plan funds between the States and between sectors.
1.16      As a means of improving collaboration between the SEBs and estab-
lishing power systems on a regional rather than a State basis, Regional
Electricity Boards (REBs) have been set up for the Northern, Southern, Eastern
and Western Regions. The chairmanship of each REB is assumed in rotation by
the chairmen of the SEBs within the region and they have staffs of engineers
seconded from their constituent SEBs. The general functions of the REBs are
to plan integrated operation of the power systems in the region for the
maximum benefit of the region as a whole, coordinate overhaul and maintenance
programs, determine generation schedules to be followed and the power avail-
able for transfer between States, and determine a suitable tariff structure
for the transfer of power within the region. The Boards function mainly in
an advisory role in relation to the SEBs over which they have no control. The
REBs will need to be strengthened if they are to fulfill a meaningful role in
the developing power sector (see para 1.37).
1.17      The two Central Power Corporations (NTPC and NHPC) were established
by GOI in 1975 to construct and operate large thermal and hydro power stations.
NTPC and NHPC are not intended to take a leading role in the generation and
sale of power in the States. In most States the SEB will continue to be the
largest power undertaking, a situation which is unlikely to change.
1.18      At the present time, four large central thermal power stations have
been planned and, as stated in paragraph 1.02, work has started on the
Singrauli and Korba projects. The next is the 2,100 MW Ramagundam development
with associated transmission. All of these developments will be constructed
and operated by NTPC. NHPC will construct and operate large hydroelectric



- 5 -
projects. A transmission wing has also been established in NHPC to design
and construct the 220 kV and 400 kV overhead transmission associated with
hydro projects, and any other transmission work which it might be commis-
sioned to undertake.
Existing Facilities
1.19      The total installed generating capacity in the whole of India
at March 31, 1978 was just over 26,000 MW, including about 2,200 MW of non-
utility capacity, mostly thermal, which is owned by major industrial consumers
to meet their own needs.  The generating capacity is shown in Table 1.1 below.

1.20      Intra-State and inter-State transmission is at 132 kV and 220 kV
and, generally, major load centers are interconnected by 132 kV and 33 kV
subtransmission lines. Distribution voltages are 11 kV and 415/240 V. The
supply, in general, is reliable, but power shortages, especially during the
summer months, necessitate shutdowns and brownouts.  About 20% of units sent
out are unaccounted for because of system losses and pilferage. These losses
are high and should be reduced to a maximum of around 15%.
Future Development
1.21      The country wide peak demand in 1976/77 was 14,490 MW; this is
expected to increase to 17,900 MW by 1978/79, with output in that year esti-
mated at about 100,000 GWh. Installed capacity by 1978/79 is expected to
reach about 29,500 MW of which 27,300 MW would be utility plant with the
balance of 2,200 MW non-utility.



- 6 -
1.22      The development program provides for an expansion of generating
capacity during the five-year period 1979/80-1983/84 by about 19,000 MW so
that the total planned installed capacity would be a little over 46,000 MW
by 1983/84. The additional capacity sc6ieduled for commissioning during this
period is shown in more detail in Table 1.2. Furthermore, the construction
of some 15,000 km of 400 kV transmission, plus about 1,000 km of High Voltage
Direct Current (HVDC) transmission, is planned to enable full integration of
the regional systems and the evacuation of the output from the proposed large
thermal power stations. This is a very ambitious program which is unlikely
to be achieved unless there is a substantial improvement in the implementation
of projects.

Source: CEA.
1.23      Table 1.3 shows the planned annual additions to capacity, aggregat-
ing 18,983 MW, and the forecast of annual capacity (peak load) and energy
requirements and availability. This demonstrates that if the program of
generation developments can be achieved, there will be surplus energy from
1979/80 through 1983/84 and a small but, generally, decreasing capacity
deficit through the five-year period. These forecasts of peak load and energy
requirements which are based upon continuous monitoring of development trends
during the preparation of the annual electric power surveys of India, appear
to be conservative.
1.24      The installed capacity shown in Table 1.3 is the sum of the name-
plate ratings of maximum continuous kilowatt capacity of all serviceable
generating equipment in the system at the end of the year. Considerations
which have to be taken into account when determining peak availability are:
seasonal availability of hydro plant, planned outages for maintenance, forced
outages, auxiliary consumption, reduction in the rated capacity due to physical
condition of the facilities, and the need for spinning reserve. Taking all
these factors into consideration, the peak availability in India, under
present operating conditions, is in the neighborhood of 60% of installed
capacity. This availability factor should gradually improve as system inter-
connection progresses and maintenance practices are improved.

five year period 1978/79 - 1983/84.
1.26      Table 1.3 also demonstrates that there will be a slight deficit in
peak availability relative to demand and forecast energy availability will be
slightly surplus to energy requirements. The forecast capacity deficit de-
creases from around 5% of the system load in 1979/80 to around 2% in 1983/84
and the energy surplus, which is negligible in 1979/80, amounts to less than 62
of energy availability in 1983/84. These are minor variations which are much
less than the accuracy of any of the forecast data inputs, but they do demon-
strate that, if anything, a case could be made for sanctioning more capacity
than presently planned, for commissioning during the five-year period ending
1983/84, particularly since data for All-India can mask shortages in specific
regions.  Planning in the power sector cannot be "fine-tuned" too precisely
and there should be some leeway to assure good system reliability.
Future Integrated Systems Operation
1.27      Planning of generation and transmission development has traditionally
been undertaken by SEBs on the basis of individual projects since they operate
within their own States and have no authority to make evaluation of possible
projects in a regional context to optimize investment decisions. The REBs have
an important role in this planning. With the rapid growth of the power sector
and with the resultant increasing complexity of operation, GOI also sees the
necessity for an integrated national approach to sector development. The
technical, economic and financial aspects of developing regional and national
power systems require considerable analysis, discussion or alternatives,
determination of design criteria for uniform adoption, and agreement among the
States and the Center on the broad principles to be followed. The operation
of such systems would require large numbers of personnel who would have to be
trained in the use of sophisticated load dispatch equipment and interconnected
systems operation.



- 8 -
1.28      A beginning was made with the creation of Regional Boards during the
period 1964-66. However, since the REBs have no statutory powers and their
effectiveness depend upon the cooperation of their constituent SEBs, progress
in the development of regional power systems has been slow. Collaboration with
the SEBs has been most successful in the Southern Region, where the regional
load dispatch center at Bangalore has successfully encouraged the exchange of
power between States and facilitated integrated operation of the power systems
in the region. Equipment for the establishment of regional and State load
control centers, financed through Credits 377-IN and 604-IN, has been or is
being ordered and, when installed, will facilitate the progressive integration
of power systems in other regions.
1.29      UNDP is assisting CEA in establishing a systems operation organiza-
tion and in developing programs for training staff that would be needed to
run the regional and national power systems when they are established. The
UNDP project covers, principally, the purchase and installation of sophisti-
cated training equipment and the training of engineers to operate the load
despatch centers. Progress on this project was discussed during negotiations.
The GOI representatives explained that the scope of the project had been
redefined and discussion of the revised scope was awaiting the appointment
by UNDP of a new Project Manager. In the meantime however CEA is proceeding
with the procurement of load despatch equipment (largely financed by the
Association under Credits 377-IN and 604-IN) and with the recruitment and
training of engineers. A large number are already under training in India
and some 80 or more engineers have been identified for training fellowships;
of the latter 39 have already been taken up.
1.30      GOI has established a committee to determine standard design para-
meters to be adopted in the construction of 400 kV transmission lines, and
Teshmont Consultants, Inc. of Canada has been engaged by CEA to assist in
the detailed studies for developing the 400 kV system. CEA has also started
work on the development of a long term national plan for power development in
India 1/; the 400 kV system study is an essential part of this study.
1.31      The organizations which are to construct and operate the regional
and national grid and the status of work regarding the development of policies
for the technical, economic and commercial operations of the national power
system were discussed with representatives of GOI and CEA during appraisal.
These matters have been the subject of continuing dialogue during the past
2-3 years and, although GOI and CEA have expressed a clear understanding of
the issues involved, they have consistently expressed the view that it is too
early to formulate policy decisions on these issues. However, the first phase
of the 400 kV system studies has now been completed. This recommends full
integrated regional operation throughout India by 1985 and includes some
15,000 km of 400 kV AC transmission plus around 1,000 km of HVDC line and
four HVDC back-to-back regional "interties" (see map). Details are shown in
Annex 1.
I/   IDA Credit 604-IN (Fourth Power Transmission Project, approved in January
1976) includes provision to help finance the cost of consultants for this
study.



- 9 -
1.32      Some of the transmission lines itemized in Annex 1 are already being
contructed by the SEBs under their own development programs and by NTPC in
association with the central thermal power projects but a great deal of con-
struction work remains to be done, which highlights the need for central
control to ensure efficient coordination of construction.
1.33      Although centralized responsibility for the construction and ulti-
mately for the operation of the national inter-connected grid would appear
to be the ideal solution and a central organization for this purpose might
ultimately be set up, because of unacceptable legislative delays (bearing in
mind the time schedule) and GOI's reluctance to set up yet another organiza-
tion at this stage, it would seem that the SEBs, NTPC and NHPC will continue
to construct these transmission lines as they fall within their respective
areas of responsibility.
1.34      Discussions were also held with representatives of the manufacturing
and contracting industries during appraisal. Manufacturing capacity does not
present a problem as GOI is willing to import material to supplement domestic
production capacity as required. There are three firms in India capable of
constructing 400 kV transmission lines. Their total capacity is 2,000 km per
annum, whereas at the peak the 400 kV program will require construction of
more than 4,000 km per annum. All three firms confirmed that they would be
capable of mobilizing to meet an annual target of this magnitude provided they
obtained a clear signal and necessary approvals from GOI in good time.
1.35      The above issues were discussed further during negotiations.  With
regard to the 400 kV construction recommended by Teshmont in the first phase
of the system studies, GOI explained that a reduction in the forecast generat-
ing capacity consequent upon a review of the Tenth Annual Power Survey has
necessitated rephasing the tramsmission program. In particular, the HVDC
recommendations are being carefully evaluated by CEA and a decision regarding
the adoption of HVDC "interties" and long distance transmission as an alter-
native to Alternating Current has yet to be made. If the HVDC component is
decided upon GOI agreed that the technology would need to be imported. GOI
further explained that CEA is setting up a central coordination and monitoring
team comprising the Chairmen of NTPC and NHPC, two Joint Secretaries and the
CEA Chairman and Member for Power Systems, to coordinate and monitor the
construction of the 400 kV power system.
1.36      With regard to the capacity of industry in India to fabricate and
construct the equipment for the transmission development program, the GOI
representatives explained that the situation had been very carefully analyzed.
Some of the SEB are now able to do their own fabrication and construction and
taking this into consideration together with the facilities of the construc-
tion companies, expanded as necessary, there was every confidence that the
program could be handled within the time span planned.
1.37      Looking ahead, it appears that the systems will operate on a
regional basis on completion of Phase 1 (1985) with the REBs responsible for
operation and control until around 1990 when the national power system is set
up. It would seem that overall control, when the national system comes into



- 10 -
operation, should be the responsibility of a central authority such as CEA
whose function would be to optimize the operation of generating plant nation-
wide on a merit-order basis. If this is the likely scenario, the roles of
the REBs and CEA would have to be cleariy established. Both the REBs and CEA
would have to be strengthened to perform these functions. These matters were
also discussed during negotiations. The GOI representatives explained that
CEA is responsible for ensuring the REBs would be adequately equipped and
staffed to handle their responsibilities for the operation of an inter-
connected system. Selection and training of staff and acquisition of equip-
ment is already underway and is expected to be substantially completed within
4-5 years. A continuing dialogue between the Bank and GOI will be maintained
on these aspects as part of the project supervision program and appraisal of
future power projects.
II.  THE BENEFICIARY - NATIONAL THERMAL POWER CORPORATION LIMITED
2.01      The Borrower of the proposed Credit and Loan would be the Government
of India and the Beneficiary would be NTPC. A Development Credit Agreement
and a Loan Agreement would be entered into between GOI and the Association,
a Project Agreement between NTPC and the Association and a Subsidiary Loan
Agreement between GOI and NTPC to cover the onlending of the Credit and the
Loan.
2.02      NTPC was established in 1975 under the Companies Act 1956, and the
Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 has been amended to give the Corporation statu-
tory recognition. NTPC is responsible to GOI and has an initial authorized
share capital of Rs 1,250 million (US$145 million). The Corporation is
managed by a Board of Directors of not less than four and not more than
fifteen, some of whom are part-time.
2.03      The main objectives for which the Corporation has been established
are:
(i)  to design, construct, and operate large central thermal
power stations and projects; and
(ii)  to distributt  and sell the power generated.
NTPC would initially own and operate the associated 400 kV transmission system
over which power would be distributed and sold in bulk to State Electricty
Boards, but this will eventually become part of the 400 kV interconnected
system forming the national grid.
2.04      NTPC presently plans to construct four central thermal power sta-
tions, one with a capacity of 2,000 MW, two with a capacity of 2,100 MW each
and one with a capacity of 1,100 MW (to be expanded ultimately to 1,600 MW).
The first to be constructed is Singrauli, located on the coal fields in Uttar
Pradesh; the second is at Korba on the coal fields in Madhya Pradesh; the
third is at Ramagundam on the coal fields in Andhra Pradesh and the fourth



- 11 -
(ultimate planned capacity 1,600 MW) is at Farakka on the coal fields in West
Bengal. It is also possible that NTPC might ultimately take over the 300 MW
Badarpur station near Delhi (ultimate planned capacity 700 MW), presently
owned by GOI. (Presently NTPC is in charge of the operation of Badarpur on
a management fee basis).
2.05      The construction of the Korba and Singrauli projects has commenced
(see paragraph 1.02) and work is progressing satisfactorily. In the case
of Singrauli, project engineering is proceeding according to schedule, founda-
tion work and piling is well ahead of schedule and major contracts for plant
and equipment have been awarded. The Korba project which commenced some twelve
months behind Singrauli is also proceeding satisfactorily; preliminary site
works comprising the construction of roads, railway siding and water and power
supplies are in hand, engineering and design works are proceeding on schedule
and tenders for the main plant and equipment have been issued (contracts for
the generators and boilers should be awarded shortly).
Bulk Supply Tariffs
2.06      NTPC will in due course enter into contracts with the recipient SEBs
for the sale of bulk power. In view of the pattern of future development in
the power sector which, on present planning, envisages NTPC power stations
forming part of a national power system by the early 1990s, the formulation
of a long-term bulk tariff policy is likely to be complicated by the different:
types of bulk transfers which will by then be involved. Thus, it is premature
to go much beyond a brief outline of principles at this juncture.
2.07      The general principle of a bulk tariff which, ideally, should con-
sist of an annual demand charge per kW of capacity allocated based on total
fixed costs (which would be a minimum charge) plus an energy charge which
would reflect short-run marginal costs was discussed with GOI at the time of
the Singrauli appraisal. This principle was agreed by GOI and it was also
agreed that from time to time such a bulk tariff would have to be revised to
take account of changes in both fixed and variable costs and to meet rate of
return targets (see paragraph 5.10). As in the cases of Singrauli and Korba,
GOI's proposal is that 85% of Ramagundam's power would be allocated, the
remaining 15% being sold in accordance with priorities, to be determined by
CEA, to States with the greatest need. An important consideration is to
protect NTPC's revenues to ensure that income from the sale of bulk power
will be adequate at all times to meet fixed and variable costs and provide the
agreed rate of return. To the extent that there is likely to be a continuing
capacity shortage for the foreseeable future, GOI's proposal outlined above
would be acceptable for the Project, comprising the first 600 MW of a planned
2,100 MW power station. During negotiations the GOI representatives advised
that four of the recipient areas (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and
Goa) have already given written undertakings to purchase 85% of the output of
power from the Project. A written undertaking from the remaining SEB (Kerala)
is to be forwarded to the Bank shortly. NTPC agreed during negotiations to
sell the output of power from the Project to SEBs under bulk supply contracts
satisfactory to the Bank. NTPC has prepared a form of bulk supply contract
for the sale of power to SEBs during the period prior to the formation of a
national power system. This is presently being examined in the Bank.



- 12 -
2.08      The bulk supply tariff would be based on marginal cost pricing
principles adjusted, as necessary, to meet financial requirements and insure
the financial viability of NTPC. This would encourage the recipient SEBs to
modify their own tariffs and tariff policies accordingly. A study of the
Andhra Pradesh power tariffs based on marginal cost principles was carried
out by the Bank in 1975 and nine other SEBs have since carried out similar
studies in connection with various credits. GOI stated during negotiations
that undertakings had been given by Karnataka Tamil Nadu and Kerala - the
other States in the Southern Region-to carry out similar tariff studies.
2.09      A high level committee has been established to review the power
supply industry in India, including the financial workings of the SEBs.
This review is, inter alia, to examine issues connected with rationalizing
the tariff structures of the SEBs, and the marginal cost based tariff studies
carried out by the SEBs should provide a useful input to this review. It
was agreed during the Korba negotiations (Credit 783-IN) that any decisions
on the timing for introducing modifications to the SEB's tariff policies
would await the recommendations of this review. This matter was discussed
during negotiations and the GOI representatives advised that the committee's
report is expected within 12 months.
Organization and Management
2.10      NTPC's organization is shown in Annex 2.  Good progress has been
made in building up the organization since early 1976 when the Chairman was
appointed. The principal departments have been established, including the
Mechanical and Electrical Design Departments, which together form the Plant
and Equipment Engineering Group, the Civil Design and Systems Engineering
Departments, which form the Civil and Systems Engineering Group, and the
Operation Services Department. The number of staff appointed as of March 31,
1978 was 454.
2.11      NTPC is developing along sound lines and has a Chairman and Managing
Director who is a competent administrator with an established reputation in
the formation and development of large industrial undertakings. He has taken
great personal interest in developing a comprehensive project management
system as well as designing the organization and procedures. Providing there
is no deterioration in its management NTPC should, with appropriate expansion
and with the assistance of consultants, be capable of handling the present
large development program (see paragraph 4.16).
Training
2.12      In India, training of engineers and operators for the operation and
maintenance of thermal stations has been inadequate and this has been reflected
in the under-utilization of generating plant with outages for periods longer
than normally required for maintenance. With the proposed growth of power
generation by 1983/84, involving an increase in the work force of some 40,000
highly skilled workers, the need for training cannot be too highly stressed.



- 13 -
2.13      NTPC places special importance on this aspect of its organization
and training programs are being developed by the Corporation which will, in
due course, be backed by a training school equipped with a simulator, financed
with Credit 793-IN, and other modern facilities for instructing and training
the operating staff.
2.14      The first generating units are not scheduled to go into commercial
operation until 1981/82, and the formulation of programs for the training of
operating staff is not of immediate importance. Consequently, earlier train-
ing will concentrate on pre-operational spheres of activity such as Planning,
Design, Construction, and Management. Most of the activities so far are
related to a one-year professional engineering training course for fresh
graduates in civil, mechanical, electrical and instrumentation engineering.
The training of the first intake of 35 executive trainees was completed on
February 4, 1978 and these engineers have now assumed executive responsibil-
ities. The training program for the second intake of 46 trainees was in
progress at the time of appraisal. Formulation of training courses for
operational staff will be undertaken in due course.
2.15      Special emphasis is placed on on-the-job training.  The methodology
includes classroom lectures, participation in group exercises and discussions
supported by direct reading, audio-visual presentations and plant visits.
Other training programs are currently being designed in Supervisory Develop-
ment, Management Development and Induction-cum-Orientation. Overall training
plans and arrangements at this time are satisfactory.
Accounting Systems
2.16      Good progress has been made in planning NTPC's accounting organiza-
tion. It has prepared and introduced a comprehensive chart of accounts and is
maintaining adequate records. It has employed accounting consultants, Messrs.
A.F. Ferguson and Co. of Bombay to assist in designing and developing systems
in areas of financial accounting such as plant accounting, procurement and
inventory control and for financial reporting generally.
Audit
2.17      The audit of NTPC books would be made by an independent auditor
appointed by the Company Law Audit Board, on the recommendation of the Auditor
General of India. The auditor appointed would normally be a member of the
Indian Institute of Chartered Accountants and his audit report on NTPC's
financial statements would be subject to comment by the Auditor General.
Messrs. V.K. Mehta and Company, Chartered Accountants, Delhi, were appointed
to audit NTPC's accounts. Audits covering the financial periods November 7,
1975 to March 31, 1977 and April 1, 1977 to March 31, 1978 have been completed
and these audit reports expressed satisfaction with the state of the company's
affairs during these periods. NTPC has already undertaken, in connection with
Credits 685-IN and 793-IN, to submit to the Association audited financial
statements within seven months of the close of the year to which they relate,
together with a certified report by the auditor and a review of the accounts
by the Director of Commercial Audits. This has been restated in connection
with the proposed Credit/Loan.

III. DEMAND AND MARKET ASPECTS
Demand for Power - All India
3.01      The demand for power in India has consistently been greater than
available capacity, principally because of financial constraints and lack of
plant maintenance but also because of failure, through poor planning, to meet
the targets for bringing new plant into operation. Installed generating capa-
city reached 18,500 MW by 1973/74 compared to the target of 23,000 MW, and
load restrictions, which have been mainly directed at industry, have adversely
affected the economic performance of the country. This, together with the
oil crisis in 1973/74 and the failure of two monsoons, which reduced the avail-
ability of hydro power, were the main reasons for the slow down in load growth
during the early 1970s. For the 20 years or so prior to 1970, sales of kWh
had been increasing at an average of 11-12% per year. The statistics shown
in Table 3.1 below indicate that the average annual growth rate declined from
about 10% in 1969/70 to just over 5% in 1974/75, resuming the previous trend
with a growth rate of about 13% in 1975/76 and 1976/77 and falling again to
less than 5% in 1977/78.

- 15 -
3.02      The improved performance in 1975/76 and 1976/77 was due to a variety
of factors, including better monsoons, commissioning of new capacity and better
utilization of existing plant. The decline in the growth rate in 1977/78 to
close to 3% was due to a number of unforeseeable factors; one of the nuclear
generating units was out of service for most of the year because of damaged
turbine blades and labor unrest, some of the major generating units had very
long outage periods and the periods of stabilization of the new large generat-
ing units were longer than anticipated. Power cuts due to capacity shortage
in some of the States - e.g., Maharashtra - was also a contributory factor.
However, GOI expects a resumption of the higher growth rate of 1975/76 and
1976/77, and an average annual growth rate of about 10% has been forecast
through 1984 (see paragraph 1.25). This is a reasonable growth rate for
India at its present stage of economic development.
Demand for Power - Southern Region
3.03      The central thermal power stations will, ultimately, form part of
the national power system but in the medium term they are intended to supply
power to the SEBs in the Region in which they are located. The Ramagundam
project is in the Southern Region and its power will be available to the
Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu SEBs, with a small allo-
cation to Goa.
3.04      Table 3.2 shows the past and future forecast trend of power con-
sumption in the four States of the Southern Region. Restrictions were in
force in Andhra Pradesh during the early 1970s, because the annual increase
in installed capacity did not keep pace with the increasing demand, and load
growth was in the neighborhood of 5% per annum. This improved to around 13%
per annum by 1975/76 and fell to 9.4% by 1977/78. It is projected to increase
to around 12% by 1979/80 and continue at this annual rate through the early
1980s.
3.05      Restrictions were in force in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu for similar
reasons during the early 1970s, but after 1976, with surplus power available
for transfer from Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, restrictions were lifted. Load
growth in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu during the early 1970s was
restricted by plant availability and, in the case of Kerala, poor monsoons.
It picked up during the late 1970s and is forecast to increase at an average
annual rate of around 9% through the early 1980s in all three States. Indus-
try accounts for about 60% of the sales of electrical energy in the Southern
Region; agriculture and irrigation about 20%.

3.06      Table 3.3 shows the forecast capacity and energy availability for
each of the SEBs in the Southern Region for the year 1983/84 which is the
year during which the Project is progressively commissioned. It will be seen
from this table that Andhra Pradesh and, to a lesser degree, Kerala are fore-
cast to have surplus capacity and energy and Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are
forecast to have capacity and energy shortages. The transmission system in-
cluded in the Project provides for power to be wheeled through Andhra Pradesh
via Nagajunasagar and Cuddapah to Bangalore in Karnataka, and to Katpadi in
Tamil Nadu. Power would be wheeled from Bangalore to Kerala over the existing
system.

3.07      The forecast power and energy requirements of the Southern Region
until 1983/84 assumes that the generation development program will be adequate
to meet the forecast load growth. In 1983/84 a small capacity deficit is
forecast which would be offset by the commissioning of the first two Ramagundam
200 MW units in that year to give a capacity surplus of just over 300 MW. This
is sound planning, essential to secure a reliable power supply. The estimates
of capacity available by 1983/84 assume that eight ongoing projects and nine
newly sanctioned projects, comprising, in aggregate 12 hydro and five thermal
projects, all due to yield benefits during the period 1978 through 1983, will
be completed and commissioned on schedule. There have always been slippages
in the past and it would be unreasonable to assume that all 17 projects will
be commissioned on schedule without slippage. Secondly, demand estimates in
the above forecasts include very little contingency. Thirdly, even if all
projects are commissioned on schedule, the surplus capacity represents onlY
about four months growth in power demand in the region. However, in the un-
likely event that the Southern Region has surplus capacity for any reasonable
period, power will be available for transfer to deficit SEBs in the Western
Region over existing or planned transmission lines.

IV. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
4.01      NTPC's present program of development, comprising the four Central
thermal power stations (Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam and Farakka) together
with associated 400 kV transmission, is part of the future power development
program for India which is described in paragraphs 1.22 through 1.26.
4.02      The Ramagundam 2,100 MW development is the third planned devplop-
ment in the series of large thermal power stations, proposed by GOI, to feed
into a 400 kV interconnected transmission system and supply bulk power to the
SEBs. GOI proposes to construct Ramagundam concurrently with the Korba and
Singrauli developments but with commencement of work and commissioning of
units lagging about sixteen months behind Singrauli and six months behind
Korba. In the case of Ramagundam, major contract awards are planned for
July 1979 and commissioning of the last unit (500 MW) is scheduled for July
1987.
4.03      The proposed site of the Ramagundam development is in the Karimnagar
District of Andhra Pradesh south of the Godavari river and in the vicinity
of the South Godavari coal fields. Site selection was based on ready avail-
ability of cooling water, coal and transportation facilities. Two thermal
power stations belonging to The Andhra Preadesh State Electricity Board
(APSEB) are already operating in the area and, consequently, infrastructure
facilities are available. Preliminary soil investigations indicate that the
main foundations for the turbine house, boiler and stack could rest directly
on rock at a depth of 6.0 meters with a safe bearing capacity of 35 t/m .
Condenser cooling will be by cooling tower with cooling water drawn through
the right bank irrigation canal from the Pochampad dam which is located some
100 km upstream of the power station. This canal has already been constructed
up to 10 km from the project area. A balancing reservoir is to be constructed
at the end of this canal which will store up to three months requirement of
water in the unlikely event of a serious canal breach. Agreement has been
reached with the Irrigation Department of Andhra Pradesh that the requirements
of the power station for 365 days will be supplied in a period of 300 days.
This implies a maximum shutdown of the canal of two months for any reason.
These arrangements are satisfactory.
4.04      As in the case of Korba the proposal is that the 2,100 MW Ramagundam
development should consist of 3 x 200 14W and 3 x 500 MW generating units
together with associated 400 kV transmission, in the case of Ramagundam
amounting to about 1,200 circuit km.
4.05      Coal for the power station will come from the South Godavari coal
fields of the Singareni collieries, and the mines to be linked with the power
station are located some 15 km from the proposed power station site. Con-
sumption will be about 7 million tonnes per year when fully developed and
production of power grade coal, which was around 3 million tonnes in 1976/77,



- 19 -
will be stepped up to meet this additional requirement as and when necessary
(see paragraph 4.12). As in the cases of Singrauli and Korba, coal will be
transported to the power station by double track unit train on the merry-go-
round system.
The Project
4.06      The Project, which represents the first phase of the Ramagundam
development, consists of:
(a)  civil works comprising acquisition of land, con-
struction of roads, culverts, railways and other
miscellaneous preliminary works, power station
and residential buildings, plant foundations,
canals, ducts, cooling towers and other works
associated with the circulating water system;
(b)  three 200 MW turbo-generating units and three
680 tonnes/hr boilers complete with all auxiliaries
and ancillary electrical and mechanical equipment
and the switchyard; and
(c) the 400 kV transmission comprising two 200 km lines
from Ramagundam to Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh, a
400 km line from Hyderabad to Cuddapah via Nagar-
junasagar, a 230 km line from Cuddapah to Bangalore
in Karnataka and a 200 km line from Cuddapah to
Katpadi in Tamil Nadu.
Estimated Cost
4.07      The estimated cost of the Ramagundam 2,100 MW power station together
with associated transmission is about Rs 11.4 billion (US$1.3 billion). The
estimated cost of the Project as defined in paragraph 4.06 is Rs 4,395 million
(US$511 million) excluding interest during construction. On the assumption
that most contracts will be won by Indian suppliers, the direct and indirect
foreign currency costs are estimated at Rs 555 million (US$64 million). The
estimated costs of the principal features of the Project are shown in Table
4.1 below and in more detail in Annex 3.

4.08      The proposed Credit and Loan aggregating US$250 million, represent-
ing 49% of the cost of the Project, should be applied to the cif and/or ex-
factory costs of plant and equipment (see paragraph 4.18). Civil works, plant
erection costs, inland transportation costs, interest during construction and
any other costs, including plant and equipment costs not financed from the
Credit, aggregating about US$326 million, would be financed by GOI in the
form of loan and equity capital.
Basis for Estimates
4.09      The estimates for the 200 MW units and boilers are based on quota-
tions received in mid-1978 for similar plant for the Korba project,escalated
by 7% per annum to bring these to estimated base prices for 1979, the year in
which the Ramagundam plant is to be ordered. The estimates for associated
equipment are based on the latest cost of similar equipment which is presently
being manufactured in India and,- where available, on actual prices quoted for
similar equipment for Singrauli and Korba, escalated by 7% per annum to the
year of placing order. Transmission estimates are based on the costs of 400 kV
construction at various locations in India, as advised by CEA. A physical
contingency of 10% has been allowed on civil works to provide for unforesee-
able factors and possible delay in project completion, and a physical contin-
gency of 5% has been allowed on plant and transmission costs. In assessing
price contingency, it has been assumed that fixed-price contracts will be
obtainable for coal handling equipment. Base 1978 costs for such plant plus
physical contingencies have been escalated at 7% per annum to the year of
placing contracts and then held constant; erection costs have been escalated
at 7% throughout the construction period, thus giving an overall price con-
tingency of 13%. Other electrical and mechanical equipment, transmission



- 21 -
costs and civil works have been escalated at 7% per annum throughout the con-
struction period, giving respective overall price contingencies of 21%, 17%
and 18%. The maximum price contingency of 20% embodied in the Korba contract
has been assumed for the generating units and boilers for Ramagundam.
4.10      The breakdown between foreign and local costs is based on the
probability that local manufacturers will submit the lowest conforming bids
for major items of plant under international bidding procedures.
Status of Engineering and Implementation
4.11      As in the cases of Singrauli and Korba, the Ramagundam development
comprises a number of major works which must be carefully coordinated to en-
sure efficient progress to completion. The Project implementation and con-
struction schedules shown in Annexes 4 and 5 set out the program of work fron
the preparation of specifications and award of contract through the construc-
tion stages for both the power station and transmission facilities to the
point of commissioning. Much of the detailed power station engineering and
design work carried out for the Singrauli and Korba projects is applicable to
Ramagundam and consequently this work should proceed rapidly. The preparation
of specifications for the power station is already in hand. The construction
schedule assumes that major power station equipment contracts can be placed by
mid 1979 and transmission contracts by end 1979 for the towers, and September
1980 for conductor and hardware. The first 200 MW unit is scheduled for com--
missioning by July 1983 and the Project will be completed by July 1984.
NTPC's implementation and construction schedules were discussed during ap-
praisal and it was agreed that these assumptions are realistic if the Projeci:
is considered in isolation. However, this Project is part of an overall devel-
opment program which is being undertaken by NTPC, with some 7,300 MW of plant
and some thousands of km of 400 kV transmission coming into operation at
phased intervals over the next ten years. Even with the most careful coor-
dination and efficient supervision of construction, there is considerable risk
of slippage. This problem is discussed further in paragraphs 4.15 and 4.16.
4.12      Land acquisition is in hand and no problems are anticipated.  Pre-
liminary soil tests have been carried out at the power station site (see para-
graph 4.03) and availability of adequate coal reserves in the South Godavari
coal fields has been proven. Production of power grade coal is to be stepped
up gradually to 10 million tonnes per annum to meet present demand and the
demand of the Ramagundam development by the time the 2,100 MW plant has been
commissioned. GOI agreed during negotiations that necessary steps will be
taken to ensure adequate coal supplies for the efficient operation of the
Project by the time the first generating unit is commissioned.
Consultants
4.13      Consultancy arrangements for the Project were discussed in some de-
tail with GOI and NTPC during appraisal. Since the detailed design of the
main plant (generating units, boilers and transformers) and specifications
would be similar to the Singrauli and Korba projects with minor modifications,
which could be handled by NTPC, GOI expressed confidence that NTPC would be



- 22 -
capable of managing the project throughout the design and construction stages
with a decreasing input from outside consultants. GOI stressed that NTPC had
built up its own organization to deal with the coordination of inputs and to
administer the Project. It has set up a strong technical services division
and established groups to take charge of project planning, site supervision,
procurement, expediting and quality assurance.
4.14      The consulting arrangements for the Korba project included the
appointment of the Thermal Design Organization (TDO) of CEA as principal
review consultant and the appointment of a retainer consultant experienced
in the design of large thermal power stations comprising 200 MW units and
larger to (i) review NTPC's basic engineering and design; (ii) assist in the
more sophisticated areas of design and (iii) provide a back up review of spe-
cifications for generating units, boilers, transformers and other specifica-
tions as required by NTPC and the Association. A consultant was also appointed
to assist in the design and supervision of construction of the 400 kV trans-
mission. Additionally NTPC employs sub-consultants to carry out the detailed
engineering for the support systems. The extent of continuing assistance
from consultants was discussed during negotiations and it was agreed that
since the basic designs for the Ramagundam project would be largely of a
repetitive nature, a retainer consultant satisfactory to the Bank would
be engaged to (i) review deviations from the earlier power station designs
and (ii) assist NTPC as necessary in the design of and preparation of spe-
cifications for the power station. NTPC will also appoint consultants to
assist, as required, in the design and supervision of construction of the
400 kV transmission.
4.15      Another matter which was discussed in detail during appraisal was
the capability of NTPC to coordinate and efficiently supervise a construction
program comprising some 7,300 MW of generating plant and some 6,000 km of
400 kV transmission and at the same time build up a recruitment and training
program for the several thousand staff who are to be engaged, over a period
of time, to operate the power stations as these are commissioned in their
various stages. GOI expressed confidence in NTPC's capacity to handle this
large program efficiently and on schedule.
4.16      NTPC is a growing organization and must, of course, continue to
grow to meet its expanding responsibilities. At the present time, a highly
motivated team is developing under a competent Managing Director.  Although
NTPC has no prior experience on any major construction project, much less
a massive program of this nature with investment aggregating some US$5,000
million, it is also confident of its ability to handle this work and its per-
formance in establishing its management team is good. However, the present
consultancy arrangements do not provide for any input on program coordination
and supervision of construction of the power stations, and it is in this area
where NTPC's lack of experience can result in costly mistakes and delays.
This matter was discussed during negotiations and in view of the importance of
this program to the development of the Indian power sector, its risks and the
costs involved, GOI and NTPC agreed to obtain the services of a consultant,
satisfactory to the Bank, with wide experience in the coordination and super-
vision of large construction projects to review NTPC's project management and
information systems and their initial implementation.



- 23 -
Procurement
4.17      Procurement of all equipment to be financed from the proposed Credit
and Loan would be on the basis of international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with the Association's guidelines. Bidding documents for such equipment,
including recommendations for award of contracts, would be prepared by NTPC
with the assistance of its consultants, and approved by the Association.
Because of NTPC's consultancy arrangements and to avoid problems of contract
coordination, the invitations to tender for major plant contracts would be on
a supply, deliver and erect basis.  This would include civil works in certain
cases where these cannot be disassociated from the plant contract - i.e. coal
handling, substation structures, transmission lines, etc. Local manufacturers
would be expected to bid for all categories of equipment. A domestic prefer-
ence of 15% or the import duty, whichever is less, would be applied in bid
evaluation. Local manufacturers are likely to win the majority of contract
awards, but to prevent procurement delays GOI agreed during negotiations that,
in the event the lowest evaluated bidder for any contract is a foreign manu-
facturer, permission to import will be forthcoming without further review by
any agency of the Government. There are competent local contracting firms
in India and also manufacturing facilities covering most of the equipment for
the Project. Therefore, all work not financed wholly or in part from,the
proposed Credit and Loan will be subject to local procurement and contracting
procedures, which are satisfactory.
Disbursements
4.18      Disbursements would be made against the cost of consultants retained
to assist in the design and supervision of construction of the Project and
against the cost of equipment and plant, including transmission equipment, on
the following basis:
(a) 100% of the ex-factory cost of equipment procured in
India after international competitive bidding; and
(b) the foreign cost of equipment procured from abroad.
The Credit would be disbursed first and any balance of the Loan not used after
commitments have been made for all items covered by the list of goods, could,
with the agreement of the Bank, be used to finance other project related equip-
ment. The estimated schedule of disbursements is shown in Table 4.2 below.

The large disbursement of US$28 million by December 31, 1979 assumes that major
plant orders will be placed during the first quarter of FY 1980.
Ecological Aspects
4.19      The Indian  National Committee on Environmental_Planning and Coordi-
nation of the Department of Science and Technology has indicated no objection
to the Ramagundam Project on environmental grounds, and during negotiations
NTPC agreed to comply with all environmental quality standards prescribed by
that committee, in the design, construction and operation of the Project.
4.20      Appropriate action will be taken during the Ramagundam design stage
to deal with the principal environmental problems which are described below.



- 25 -
(a) Location
The proposed Ramagundam power station is a pit head
station located in the vicinity of the South Godavari
coal fields, and is remote from any settled area other
than the colonies associated with the Project, the
collieries, APSEB power stations and several indus-
trial complexes located in the area. Accordingly,
there is only the need to ensure the health and
environment of the operating staff of the several
plants and their families.
(b) Stack Emissions
Electrostatic precipitators will be installed and the
stack will be of such a height that emitted particulate
matter will be spread over a sufficiently wide area to
reduce the density of pollutants to an acceptable level.
The sulphur content of the coal is in the range of 0.3%
to 0.6% which is low and does not present a pollution
problem.
(c) Ash Disposal
The ash will be pumped as a slurry, through a pipeline,
to an ash dump area located some 3 miles from the power
station. Water will drain away in accordance with the
natural configuration of the area and will have no
detrimental effect on the local ecological system.
4.21      With regard to the safety and occupational health of employees,
safety regulations for power stations, to which all operating personnel must
conform, will be strictly enforced. As far as noise levels are concerned,
the turbine hall of a modern steam turbine power station, the noisiest area,
has a sound pressure level of less than 90 decibles and is well under the
maximum acceptable threshold for the normal 8 hour/day shift worker.
Completion Report
4.22      In order to inform the Bank and the borrower about the performance
of the Project and the lessons learned during its execution, a completion re-
port is required following the Closing Date of the credit. This matter was
discussed during negotiations and NTPC agreed not later than six months after
the Closing Date or such later date as may be agreed for this purpose between
NTPC and the Bank, to prepare and furnish to the Bank a report of such scope
and in such detail as the Bank shall reasonably request, on the execution and
initial operation of the Project, its cost and the benefit derived and to be
derived from it, the performance by the Borrower and the Bank of their respec-
tive obligations under the Credit and Loan Agreements and the accomplishment
of the purposes of the Credit and the Loan.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Introduction
5.01      NTPC was established in 1975 to construct and operate large Central
thermal power stations and associated transmission (see paragraphs 2.02 and
2.03). Its first audited annual report was in respect of FY1977. It has no
operating assets at the present time.
5.02      Forecasts of NTPC's annual financial operations for the period
FY1979 through FY1990 are presented in Annexes 6 to 9. They are based on an
investment program (Annex 7 page 2), which envisages the construction of
7,300 MW of thermal generating plant, together with 6,000 km of 400 kV trans-
mission lines, all of which are expected to be commissioned by March 1987.
The construction program remains virtually unchanged since the Korba Thermal
Power Project was appraised in August 1977.
5.03      It is expected that NTPC will continue to expand its thermal genera-
tion capacity by the construction of additional large sized plants. GOI con-
firmed during negotiations that the transfer of ownership to NTPC of other GOI
operating installations was not contemplated at this time. In addition NTPC
has assumed responsibility for the management and accounting of the Badarpur
thermal power station from April 1, 1978 on a management fee basis. This
involves directing operations of the existing 300 MW thermal generating plant,
responsibility for the ongoing construction of a 200 MW generating unit about
to be commissioned, and for constructing an additional 200 MW generating unit
already sanctioned.
Future Earnings
5.04      Under present assumptions, NTPC will not become revenue earning
until its first 200 MW generating unit is commissioned on January 1, 1982.
Additional capacity expected to be brought into commercial operation in sub-
sequent years is set out in Annex 6 page 2. Both GOI and NTPC agreed in
connection with Credit 793-IN (Korba Thermal Power Project) that NTPC would
achieve in FY1989 1/, and thereafter, a rate of return of not less than 9.5%
on the historic cost of its average net fixed assets in service, and to set
tariffs from the time of commissioning of the first generating unit in
Singrauli or Korba, at levels not lower than the estimated tariffs necessary
to achieve the required 9.5% return in FY1989.
5.05      During appraisal, the previous forecasts of energy output of the
200 MW and 500 MW generation units assumed in the Singrauli and Korba
appraisals were reviewed and modified by extending the period expected to be
needed to bring each generating unit up to 5,500 hours of operation a year
by one year, and reducing the forecasts of energy output in the intervening
periods (Annex 9,paragraph 2). Additionally the costs of the main plant and
1/   The first fiscal year in which all generating units at Singrauli were
projected to operate at 5,500 hours a year.



- 27 -
equipment have subsequently been increased to reflect the latest available
prices. This has also contributed to increased operating costs.
5.06      The impact of the changed assumptions is that:
(a) due to increases in both plant and operating costs and to
the reduced forecasts of energy sales, the required sell-
ing price would rise to about 26 paise/kWh from the 22
paise/kWh calculated in the Korba appraisal to achieve a
9-1/2% rate of return in FY1989;
(b) the Singrauli Power Station (2,000 MW) would only achieve
full commercial operation (5,500 hours per unit per year)
in FY1990 instead of FY1989.
The revised bulk supply price of about 26 paise/kWh would produce annual
losses of Rs 486 million (US$57 million) during the initial four years of
operation from FY1982 to FY1985 compared to losses of Rs 369 million (US$43
million) previously forecast for the initial three years, in the Korba proje!ct
appraisal.
5.07      During the "going into business" period of FY1982-1985 when
expenses are relatively high and sales relatively low, bulk supply prices
of 51 paise, 33 paise, 30 paise, and 28 paise per kWh would have to be
charged for operating revenues and expenses to break even. These would
be unreasonably high and would be uncompetitive with SEB generating costs.
For the short term, therefore, the initial losses should be regarded as an
integral part of NTPC's development program. They would be financed by
GOI equity subscription.
5.08      The amendment to Section 75A of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948,
requires GOI to specify the surplus to be earned by NTPC to provide a rea-
sonable amount to contribute towards the cost of capital works and for the
payment of dividends. In view of the rapid build up of plant by NTPC, the
absence of revenue until FY1982, the likelihood that there will be no addi-
tional long term construction plans, other than those planned already, and the
need to maintain competitive bulk prices for energy sales to SEBs, this would
not be achieved by NTPC before FY1988. During negotiations, GOI explained
that the determination of the appropriate amount of surplus would depend in
part upon NTPC's future investment program at the time the organization be-
came revenue-earning, which would not be until FY1982. Thus, it would be pre-
mature to specify a surplus at this stage. However GOI confirmed that working
capital requirements not met from NTPC's internal cash generation would be
provided by financial institutions or GOI.
5.09      There is need for NTPC to consider the real value of assets as well
as the original or historic cost. The GOI representatives, however, explained
during negotiations that memorandum accounts which would note asset and depre-
ciation data at current price levels would not be maintained by NTPC as these
accounts were not required for commercial accounting purposes in India. How-
ever, appropriate information would be available from the normal accounts



- 28 -
maintained by NTPC which would facilitate such an exercise. NTPC must, of
course. continue to present historic asset values in its official balance
sheets, and depreciation in accordance with the principles to be laid down
by GOI in consultation with CEA, as provided for in the financial amendments
to the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948.
5.10      The existing covenant agreed in connection with Credit 793-IN for
Korba that NTPC would achieve in FY1989 and maintain thereafter a rate of
return not less than 9-1/2% and to set tariffs from the time the first gene-
rating unit at Singrauli is commissioned, at levels not lower than estimated
to achieve the required 9-1/2% rate of return in FY1989 has been restated in
the proposed project agreement.

5.13       The financing plan provides for the construction of the ongoing
Singrauli and Korba projects, the proposed Ramagundam Project and the tent:a-
tive Farakka Project together with the continuing construction of the gene-
ration and transmission referred to in paragraph 5.11 at an overall cost of
Rs 47,903 million (US$5,570 million). The overall cost of the first phases
of the Singrauli, Korba and proposed Ramagundam projects represent about 27%
of this ten-year program. It is anticipated that GOI will request additional
financial assistance for the balance of the program. NTPC expects to maintain
a debt/equity ratio not exceeding 50/50.
5.14.     The proposed IDA Credit and Bank Loan would be relent by GOI to
NTPC on terms acceptable to the Bank. The terms of the onlending agreements
in respect of the two previous Credits provide for final maturity in 20 years,
including a grace period of 5 years, and repayment of principal in equal semi
annual installments together with interest at 10.25% per annum. This is l:he
rate at which GOI normally lends to industrial enterprises and compares with
about 11% charged by domestic lending institutions for similar types of lending.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that GOI will provide the baLance
of the capital needed to complete the Project on terms satisfactory to the
Bank.

5.15      The remaining part of the investment program will be accomplished
during the period FY1987 through FY1988. The following table indicates the
expected growth of internal cash generation (net of debt service and working
capital increases), and the surplus funds expected to be generated.

5.16      From Annex 7, it can be seen that NTPC would not generate sufficient
internal funds to meet its requirements for working capital and loan amortiza-
tion until FY1987. Until that time GOI's equity contributions would meet the
shortfall.
5.17      A financially viable corporation such as NTPC, apart from financing
a reasonable proportion of construction from its internal cash generation,
would normally be expected to commence paying dividends on its paid-up share
capital. Tariffs should therefore be expected to provide funds for this
purpose. Assuming allocation of the surplus funds in FY1989 and FY1990 on the
basis that annual appropriations to finance construction would equal 25% of a
continuing annual investment of Rs 4,000 million (US$465 million), then NTPC
might start paying dividends by FY1989.
Future Finances
5.18      A Sources and Applications of Funds Statement is included in Annex 7.
Condensed Balance Sheets as at March 31, 1977 (actual) through FY1990 (fore-
cast) are shown in Annex 8. Table 5.3 below shows NTPC's projected financial
position at March 31, 1982 (end of the year when NTPC becomes revenue earning),
at March 31, 1985 (end of year following commissioning of the proposed Rama-
gundam Project), and at March 31, 1990 (the year in which Singrauli Thermal
Power Station (2,000 MW) would be operating 5,500 hours a year).

5.19      Reviewing Table 5.3, by March 31, 1982, after NTPC commences to
earn revenue, its total capitalization would be Rs 21,224 million (US$2,468
million).  Three years later - the end of 1985, after the Ramagundam Thermal
Project would be commissioned - NTPC's capitalization would have doubled to
Rs 44,775 million (US$5,206 million) with a debt/equity ratio of 49/51. By
FY1990, when the 7,300 MW of generating plant and over 6,000 circuit km of
400 kV transmission had been installed, its capitalization would amount to
Rs 48,699 million (US$5,663 million). With no additional debt after FY1985
but an increasing liability for repayment, the debt/equity ratio would fall
to 34/66 by the end of FY1990.
5.20      The level of current assets in NTPC's balance sheet assumes its SEB
consumers would have one month within which to pay their energy bills. Since
NTPC's monthly billings for energy supplied would be running at the rate of
nearly US$3 million in FY1983, US$44 million by FY1986, and US$102 million
by FY1990, late payment by SEBs could seriously jeopardize NTPC finances.
During negotiations GOI and NTPC were alerted to the magnitude of this prob-
lem. The Indian delegation explained that alternative approaches to terms of
supply to SEBs were currently under review by NTPC and would be discussed
with the Bank in due course. This matter will be the subject of continuing
dialogue during future supervision and appraisal missions.
Debt Restriction
5.21      The Companies Act 1956 (Section 293.1(d)) restricts borrowing by
the Board of NTPC to within a sum equal to the aggregate of the paid up share
capital and the "free reserves" (i.e. those which are not set apart for any
specific purpose) except with the consent of the corporation in general meeting.



- 32 -
During negotiations, NTPC agreed to inform the Bank beforehand of any proposal
to alter or modify existing limitations on the borrowing powers of its Board
of Directors.
VI. JUSTIFICATION
The Need for Ramagundam's Power Capacity in the Southern Region
6.01      Electricity consumption in the Southern Region was inhibited by
restrictions in all the States other than Kerala due to shortage of capacity
during the early 1970s when load growth in the Region as a whole averaged
around 7% per annum. By 1977/78, with the commissioning of additional capa-
city, restrictions were largely lifted and the forecast growth rate for the
period 1978/79 thru 1983/84, the year in which the Project starts coming into
commercial operation, averages around 10% per annum. This is in line with
the forecast national growth rate.
6.02      Annex 10 which shows projections of energy requirement, peak demand
and installed capacity through 1983/84 in the Southern Region demonstrates
that additional capacity which is planned to come on stream during the early
1980s is, together with the additional capacity provided by the Project,
slightly more than needed to meet the forecast energy and capacity require-
ments of the Southern Region. However, the capacity and energy surplus is
not large and, bearing in mind the high probability of slippage in an overall
construction program of this magnitude (this has been the general experience
in the past (see paragraph 3.07)), it is likely that the deficits will continue
through 1983/84. The timing of the Project for commissioning progressively
through 1983/84 can therefore be justified on this basis alone but the principal
technical and commercial justification is the increasing need for additional
thermal capacity during the post 1983/84 period assuming a continuation of
the 10% annual growth rate and the limited exploitable hydro resources which
will, by then, be available.
Comparison of Alternatives
6.03      The decision to establish large central thermal power stations on
the coal fields was taken by GOI after careful consideration of India's future
needs for electric power and its resources to meet these needs. The main
considerations were (i) the need to use the substantial resources of low-grade
coal which, due to the very high ash content, has no commercial value other
than usage at the pit head to generate electricity and (ii) the need to install
large blocks of capacity to augment the States' development programs in order
that the chronic shortage of capacity in India, which has been a feature in
past years, should be eliminated as soon as possible.
6.04      Bearing in mind the foregoing comments, the central thermal power
stations should be viewed in a national context rather than a regional context
although, initially, their power may be allocated to the States within the
region in which they are located. In the long-term planning context, there is



- 33 -
no alternative to these large central thermal power stations; they represent
the cheapest cost of thermal generation using fossil fuel and they are intended
to augment, not replace, other planned thermal, hydro and nuclear power devel-
opments. A comparison of alternatives therefore, can only be examined in the
context of merit order of construction, i.e., should India be proceeding now
with Ramagundam or later? If later what would be the more economic alterna-
tive to be constructed now in place of Ramagundam?
6.05       Considering, for the purpose of this exercise, that the justifica-
tion of the Ramagundam development is based, initially, on the needs of the
Southern Region, the alternatives examined were (a) nuclear, (b) hydroelectric
and (c) smaller coal fired thermal power stations at load centers, all to
provide the same amount of power.
6.06       The nuclear alternative was ruled out because of the long gestation
period (8-10 years for the first unit) once such a decision had been made.
With regard to the hydro alternative a number of sites in the Southern Region
are scheduled for development during the period 1978/79 through 1982/83 but
these are to be developed in parallel with Ramagundam and are supplements and
not alternatives to this development. Other hydro potential in the Southern
Region which is under investigation consists mainly of small schemes; a great
deal of feasibility work still has to be carried out, and, with the long gesta-
tion period, these could in no way constitute a realistic alternative to
Ramagundam within the same time scale.
6.07       The remaining alternative, the development of smaller coal-fired
power stations at load centers in the Southern Region, was then examined. The
comparison of this alternative, comprising three separate 700 MW installations,
with the proposed Ramagundam 2,100 MW pit head development, is described in
detail in Annex 11. The most important cost differences were the higher coaL
transportation costs which made operating costs for the alternative more ex-
pensive and the higher transmission costs which made the Project more capitaL
intensive. Of the two, Ramagundam was shown to be the more economic at
discount rates below 27%.
6.08      Not surprisingly, the above results are similar to those obtained
in the case of the Singrauli and Korba projects when making similar compari-
sons. These results are a little sensitive to significant variations in the
most uncertain factors of the two alternatives; a 10% increase in the capitaL
cost of Ramagundam at market prices reduces the equalizing discount rate to
just over 14% and a 10% reduction in the capital cost of the alternative re-
sults in an equalizing discount rate of just under 15%. At shadow prices,
the eqalizing discount rate, assuming the same variations, are, respectively,
16% and 17%. Such a differential between costs is, in fact, unlikely because
two thermal power developments are being compared and the likelihood is that
any cost variation would be in the same direction for both alternatives.
6.09      Another thermal alternative examined was the installation of
4 x 500 MW units instead of 3 x 200 MW plus 3 x 500 MW. On a straight com-
parison there would be savings in investment and in operating and fuel costs
with the 4 x 500 MW option. However, the largest generating units in operation



- 34 -
in India until recently were the 120 MW units on which substantial teething
troubles have been experienced. The first 200 MW units were only recently
commissioned (late 1977) and it would be prudent to obtain two or three years
operating experience with these units before proceeding to the still larger
size of 500 MW, with their more sophisticated operating and maintenance pro-
cedures. On a risk analysis basis, higher expected costs would have to be
associated with a first phase of 500 MW units. These contingent costs are
based on the greater likelihood of breakdown with the larger units resulting
in longer outage periods and consequent loss of revenue. This risk should be
reduced for the three 500 MW units in the second phase of the development as
by that time generating units of this size will be manufactured in India and
experience should have been gained in their operation and maintenance. Bharat
Heavy Electricals (BHEL) of India has concluded a collaboration agreement with
Kraftwerke Union of Germany for the manufacture of 500 MW units and the first
such unit, which is being financed by Kreditanstaldt (KfW) of Germany, is be-
ing installed at Trombay power station (Loan No. 1549-IN). Provision is being
nade for a transfer of experience on the construction stage of this project
to NTPC before moving to the 500 MW size for the central thermal developments.
The foregoing considerations favor proceeding first with the 3 x 200 MW in-
stallation and justify this alternative for the first phase of the Ramagundam
development.
Return on Investment
6.10      The return on investment relates the additional expected revenues
(attributable to the Ramagundam development) to the expected economic costs.
Given a realistic tariff of 26 paise/kWh as an approximation of quantifiable
benefits, the return on investment will be about 10%. This is not subject to
any significant change when labor and foreign exchange are shadow priced. A
sensitivity analysis of these results and a fuller discussion of the assump-
tions on which they are based is given in Annex 11.
Project Risks
6.11      The Project is one phase of an overall development program which
comprises 7,300 MW of generating plant and some 6,000 km of 400 kV transmis-
sion. This is a tightly designed program with plant and transmission coming
in at phased intervals throughout the period 1981/82 through 1987/88. Main-
taining this program on schedule requires careful coordination and expert
supervision at all levels. The principal risk area is the possibility of
slippage which could give rise to delayed commissioning of plant and loss of
revenues. With a program of construction of this magnitude some delays are
bound to occur but these can be kept to a minimum with careful coordination
and supervision during construction and careful attention, when placing con-
tracts, to the capability of Indian manufacturers to meet the delivery
schedules.
6.12      Other risk areas are in engineering design, cost overruns and exten-
sive teething troubles during the early operational stage with resultant loss
of revenues. There is also the risk of damage due to fire, explosion, etc.,
but this is covered by insurance provided by the respective contractors during



- 35 -
the construction stage and by GOI through its self-insurance policy after
commissioning.
6.13      With regard to the risk areas enumerated in paragraph 6.14 above:
(i) NTPC is being assisted by consultants and sub-
consultants, and this should minimize problems
due to errors at the engineering and design stage;
(ii) Plant and equipment costs are based on similar works
currently in progress in India; provision has been
made for cost escalation and there should be little
risk of any substantial cost overrun;
(iii) a number of 200 MW generating units will have been in
operation for some years before the Project is commis-
sioned, and, hopefully, teething troubles will be avoided.
VII. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS
7.01      During negotiations the following issues were raised with GOI and
satisfactory agreement or assurances were obtained with regard to:
(a) taking necessary action to ensure adequate coal supplies
for the power station by the time the first generating unit
is scheduled to go into service (para 4.12);
(b) permission to import without further review by any agency
of the Government in the event the lowest evaluated bidder
for any contract to be financed through the Credit and
Loan is a foreign manufacturer (para 4.17); and
(c) provision of the balance of capital to complete the
Project together with any additional funds which might
be needed due to cost overruns or other unforeseeable
factors (para 5.14).
7.02      During negotiations the following issues were raised with GOI and
NTPC and satisfactory agreement or assurances were obtained with regard to:
(a) the sale of the output of power from the project to
selected SEBs under bulk supply contracts satisfactory
to the Association (para 2.07);
(b) the annual financial statements which should be submitted
to the Association no later than seven months after the
end of the financial year to which they relate, together
with certified copies of the independent auditor's opinion
and the review of the accounts by the Director of Commer-
cial Audits (para 2.17);



- 36 -
(c) the employment of consultants whose qualifications, experience
and terms and conditions of employment shall be satisfactory
to the Bank, to assist NTPC in the detailed design of and
preparation of specifications for the Project and in the
review of NTPC's project management system (paras 4.14 and
4.16);
(d) compliance with environmental quality standards prescribed
by the National Committee on Environmental Planning and
Coordination (para 4.19);
(e) preparation of a completion report not later than six
months after the Closing Date or such later date as may
be agreed between NTPC and IDA (para 4.22);
(f) to set tariffs from the time the first generating unit
is commissioned at Singrauli at levels not lower than
those estimated to achieve the required 9-1/2% rate of
return in FY1989 (para 5.10); and
(g) any proposal to alter or modify existing limitations on
the borrowing powers of NTPC's Board of Directors
(para 5.21).
7.03      Subject to the foregoing assurances the Project would be suitable
for Bank Group finance of US$250 million comprising an IDA Credit of US$200
million and a Bank Loan of US$50 million.

O&M Expenses
Power Station - 2.5% on original cost of plant
Transmission - one-half of 1% of original cost
Depreciation
Power Station - 3.1% of original cost
Transmission - 2.6% of original cost
Note:     Section XVII (8) of the 6th Schedule of the Act provides for depre-
ciation "from the beginning of the year of account next following
that in which the particular asset became available for use in
the business".
Tariffs
3.        NTPC has an obligation to achieve a rate of return of not less than
9.5% on the forecast average net fixed assets in service by FY1989, and from
the commencement of its commercial operations in FY1982 to set tariffs at
levels not lower than those required to achieve a 9.5% rate of return on the
forecast data for FY1989. On this basis and taking account of the longer time
which is forecast before each generating unit is operating at 5,500 hours a
year the average price of 25.90 paise per kWh calculated on the FY1989 esti-
mates is assumed as the average price for all sales from December 1981.
Fuel
4.        The fuel cost is based on the 1976 coal prices per tonne shown in
paragraph 2 and escalated at 5% per annum to FY1982. 1/ Thereafter, a fuel
clause is assumed in the bulk supply contract to permit adjustment to meet
any further variation of fuel costs. The effect of any fuel price variation
is shown separately in the forecast expenses and recovered by means of a fuel
surcharge.
Rate Base
5.        Construction costs are based on 1978 prices escalated in subsequent
years at 7% per annum on civil works and at 7% per annum on plant and machinery
subject however to a maximum increase of 15% on 500 MW generating units, 20%
on 200 MW units for Korba and Ramagundam and 25% on 200 MW units for Singrauli.
The average rate base is half the sum of the net fixed assets in service at
the beginning and end of the year.
1/   An additional 5% cost is added for the fuel oil needed for starting and
low load operation plus tax of Rs 5 per tonne.

Borrowing
6.        The proposed Credit and Loan would be relent by the GOI to NTPC for
a period of 20 years from the date of withdrawal of the first installment
including a 5 year grace period repayable in equal semi-annual installments of
principal together with interest at the rate of 10-1/4% per annum on unpaid
balances.
7.        Other capital requirements would be advanced by GOI in the form
of debt and fully paid up equity capital provided that the unpaid debt at
the end of each year would not exceed the sum of the issued share capital
and the "free" reserves, that is to say, those which are not set apart for
specific purposes.
8.        GOI loans (including the onlending of the proposed Credit and Loan)
are assumed to finance either defined projects, e.g. three 200 MW generating
sets including associated transmission which forms the Ramagandam Thermal
Power Project, or individual generating units and transmission lines included
in NTPC's investment program. Interest on the loans up to the date of com-
missioning of each unit of plant would be charged to construction, and sub-
sequent interest accruals would be charged to revenue. Repayment of principal
is assumed in 30 semi-annual installments commencing on the first anniversary
following the end of five year grace period.
Working Capital
9.        Variations in working capital represent the differences between the
sums of the individual items making up current assets less current liabilities
at the beginning and at the end of the year.
Balance Sheets (Annex 8)
10.       Current Assets
(a) Receivables are assumed at a level equivalent to approxi-
mately one twelfth of the revenue for the year;
(b) Inventories are assumed at 1% of gross assets at the
end of the year;
Current Liabilities
(a) Current liabilities are assumed at a level of one month's
fuel cost, plus 4% of the annual operating and maintenance
expenses.

RAMAGUNDAM THERMAL POWER PROJECT
NATIONAL THERMAL POWER CORPORATION LIMITED
The Economic Justification of the Project
The Return on Investment
1.        The internal rate of return on the 2,100 MW Ramagundam thermal power
station plus associated transmission demonstrates the relationship between the
revenues implied by the proposed tariff policy and the cost of the project at
constant 1978 prices. For the purpose of this calculation it is assumed that
the 2,100 MW of generating capacity will operate an average of 5,500 hours
each year. It is further assumed that power station and associated consumption
will amount to 9% of kWh generated and transmission losses will amount to 2.3%
of kWh sent out. On this basis of performance criteria the expected tariff
is 25.9 paise per kWh and annual revenues when full development is reached
will amount to Rs 2,656 million.
2.        Costs and revenues, which are listed in Table 1 are at constant
(1978) market prices, and revenues are based, not upon prices that reflect
incremental costs but upon those required to meet the financial requirements
of NTPC. All costs are net of identifiable taxes and duties. Operation and
maintenance costs have been based on 2.5% of the capital costs of the power
station and 0.5% of the capital costs of transmission. The total notional
fuel cost in 1978 prices has been estimated at Rs 89 per ton.
3.        On the foregoing assumptions the internal rate of return at market
prices is about 10%. In terms of shadow prices based on efficiency pricing
of costs and benefits, the rate of return is unchanged. For purpose of
shadow pricing, the assumptions were: (i) all identifiable tradeable goods
are expressed in CIF prices; (ii) non-tradeables and unidentified tradeables
are adjusted to border prices by using a conversion factor of 0.87; (iii) labor
components of cost are shadow priced at 0.75 of the market rate and converted
to border prices via the above conversion factor; (iv) wholesale revenues are
converted to border prices using the above conversion factor, the alternative
use of the funds by SEBs being a mix of expenditures. Sensitivity analyses
on these rates of return are shown in Table 3.
4.        The above estimates of the rate of return cannot relate the costs
of the project to the value of additional power to the ultimate beneficiaries.



ANNEX 11
Page 2 of 5 pages
Retail level consumers are principally from agriculture, industry and services,
so that it is only through their final product that the bulk of power generated
reaches the ultimate beneficiary. Thus, it is very difficult to take equity
considerations adequately into account. However, the efficient use of power
can be greatly encouraged by an appropriate retail tariff policy.  A series
of studies of long-run marginal cost pricing have been prepared in a number
of States in India. These are presently under review in the Bank. Increases
in retail tariffs should yield the dual results of increased internal resource
generation within the power sector and marginally reduced rates of demand
growth in the long run. These should both help in meeting demand for power
efficiently over the next decade.
Selection of the Most Economic Alternative
5.        The alternatives to the Remagundam 2,100 MW development which were
considered were hydro, nuclear and alternative thermal development. The
hydro was rejected on the grounds that the most readily available sites are
already included in the SEB's development program and are supplements, not
alternatives, to Ramagundam. Other possible hydro developments are subject
to a great deal of feasibility investigations and this, together with the
long gestation period, precludes the commissioning of the additional capacit:y
required within the given time span. Also since hydro rarely, if ever, pro--
vides the same degree of firm capacity and energy as an equivalent thermal
development, it is unlikely in any event to be a realistic alternative. In
the case of the nuclear alternative, the long gestation period of nuclear
power development (8-10 years for the first unit), the technical problems in
developing such a large power station and the attendant political problems
eliminate this as a practicable alternative. This left a continuation of
development by the SEBs of, say, three smaller 700 MW power stations (or
similarly extending existing installations), located at load centers, as
the next best alternative.
6.        A comparison of the cost streams of the two alternatives, which are
shown in Table 2, indicates that Ramagundam is the most economic alternative.
While the next best alternative (separate power stations located at load
centers) was less capital-intensive since no transmission was involved, its
operating costs were dominated by high fuel costs (Rs 140 per tonne to include
transportation costs compared with the pithead price of Rs 89 per tonne for
Ramagundam), a slightly higher fuel consumption due to the smaller generating
units and slightly higher O&M costs due to diversified location of plant.
7.        The comparison between the two alternatives based on net benefit
streams at 10% and 13% showed that the present values of the costs of
Ramagundam were, respectively, Rs 1,178 million and Rs 722 million lower than
those of the next best alternative at the same discount rates.  At market
prices, the equalizing discount rate is 27%, at shadow prices it is 30%.
The sensitivity analyses of both market and shadow prices are summarized in
Table 3.
