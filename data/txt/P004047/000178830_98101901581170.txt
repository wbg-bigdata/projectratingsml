SUMMARY
1,        Korea Developrnent Finance Corporation (KDFC) has applied for a
third Bank loan, of $30 million. It expects that a Bank loan of that amount
would be sufficient to meet about three-fourths of its requirements for
financing the imports of its borrowers until the end of 1972.
2.        KDFC was established in April :1967 under the sponsorship of the
Federation of Korean Industries (formerly Korean Businessmen's Association)
with the active support of the Government and the Bank Group. Its financing
was completed in February 1968, when the subscriptions of the foreign
investors and IFC were paid in. KDFC's objective is to assist private
industrial investment in Korea.
3.        Korea's manufacturing sector has been expanding at a very rapid
rate. Its output growth in real terms during 1965-1969 was 22% per annum,
twice as fast as the growth of CNP. Exports of manufactured products have
since 1965 increased about twice as fast as manufacturing production, and in
1969 accounted for 15% of total manufacturing production (in terms of gross
output) and about 79% of Korea's total etxports. Total merchandise exports
reached $658 million in 1969, and are estimated to have approached $1,000
million for 1970, an increase of more thLan 40% over 1969.  The future growth
of the Korean economy depends heavily on the continued expansion of the
export-oriented manufacturing sector, for which the prospects remain good.
Financial problems are among the more difficult that face Korean industria-
lists.  The capital and money markets are embryonic, Venture capital is in
short supply, as are short-term funds at reasonable rates.  The "unorganized"
(curb) market supplements other resources, but at interest rates of up to
5 a month.
4.        KDFC is well organized and effliciently managed and its professional
staff is competent. The Board of Directors and the Executive Committee have
shown good judgment in their investment decisions. Project appraisals are of
high standard, Project supervision neeis improvement, in view of the growing
portfolio, and is receiving the management's close attention. Internal
procedures are thorough and the work flow is efficient. KDFC's portfolio is
sound.
5.        As of December 31, 1970, a total of 79 loans and equity operations
had been approved, amounting to US$36.2 million equivalent.  KDFC's approv3ls
during 1970, its third year, totalled about US$21 million equivalent, 38%
more than the aggregate of approvals during its first two years, 1968 and
1969. Business prospects for the next two years appear good.
6.        Although the proportion of KDFC's financing is small in relation
to estimated gross domestic capital investment in manufacturing, the company
has made an importapt qualitative contribution to higher project evaluation
standards and sound %Svelopment banking practices in Korea.



- ii -
7.        KDFCIs total assets, at December 31, 1970, stood at about US$25.4
million equivalent. Available resources of foreign exchange totalling $28
million (two Bank loans of $25 million and a $3 million AID loan) had beanr
largely committed by the end of 1970, Out of total Won resources of about
W4.8 billion (including a government subordinated loan of W2,025 million),
an amount of W2,85 billion has been comm:Ltted. The balance of about WL.9
billion is expected to meet KDFC's requirements until the end of 1972. KDEC
expects to obtain further Won funds by new isgues of share capital amounting
to W903 million in early 1972 and %75 m:illion in 1973. KDFC's profitability
is relatively high and from the 1970 resilts (net profit of 40,7% on share
capital and 21.1% on year-end net worth) the company has declared a 20%
dividend, 10% cash and 10% stock.
8.        On the basis of projected commitments for financing imports of
about US$41 million during the two-year period beginning January 1971, a
third Bank loan to KDFC of US$30 million is justified. Considering the size
of KDFC's loans and the high standard of its appraisals, an increase in the
free limit to US$500,000 from US$300,000 is recommendedw, The debt/equity
ratio ceiling should be kept at 3. The :Loan should be made on the terms
generally applied to loans to development finance companies.

APPRAISAL OF
KOREA DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
I   INTRODUCTION
1.        The Bank Group collaborated actively with KDFC's sponsors, the
Federation of Korean Industries (formerly Korean Businessmen s Association),
in shaping the plans that led to KDFC's establishment in 1967, KDFC is the
largest privately-controlled development finance company in Korea and operates
alongside a few government-owned financial and investment institutions, KDFC
has received two loans from the Bank totalling US$25 million. The company's
performance (last reviewed in the appraisal report No. DB-49 of April 24i,
1969) has been satisfactory and the second Bank loan, US$20 million, is
expected to be fully committed early in 1971. In view of the substantial
volume of pending applications for financing, KDFC reeds new capital soon,
This report appraises KDFC and recommends a third Bank loan, for US$30
million.
II. ENVIRONMENT
Recent Economic Growth
2,        The economic background to KDFC's operations is described in the
latest economic report on Korea (EAP-12a, March 16, 1970).
3.        KDFC's establishment in 1967 coincided with the launching of the
second Five-Year Plan 1967-1971. Since then, the Forean economy has grown
rapidly, In 1969, per capita GMP reached $195 and real MP increased by
15.9%. The most important growth stimuli have been investment and exports.
Investment reached 27% of EP in 1968 and 30% in 1969. Gross fixed manufac-
turing investment reached $370 million equivalent in 1969. Exports increased
by 33% in 1969 and about 45% in the first nine months of 1970. On the basis
of provisional figures, exports for 1970 are expected to come close to $1,00C
million.  The high growth rate, however, hias created some imbalances and
considerable strains in the economy resulting in continuing inflation (about
10% a year), an increasing trade deficit and a rapidly mounting external debt
service. To cool down the overheated economy the Government put into effect,
late in 1969, a stabilization program consisting mainly of slowing down
investments, curbing private foreign borrowing and restricting bank credits.
Industrial Environment
4.        Recent expansion.  Manufacturing has been the fastest growing sector
of the Korean economy. Its output growth in real terms during 1965-1969 was
22% per annum, twice as fast as the growth of GNP.  The share of manufacturing



- 2 -
in GNP has increased from 14% in 1960 to 26% in 1969. The most important
manufacturing eeotors are textiles, food processing, plywood, rubber products,
chemicals, metal products and machinery. Exports of manufactures were
growing even faster than total output, at nearly 50% per annum, and account
for about 80% of total exports in 1970.  Exports of manufactures in 1969
amounted to $555 million and consisted ofl textiles (49%), machinery (9.4%),
processed foods, chemicals, metal products and plywood.
5.        Structure.  During 1965-1969, the output of consumer goods has
increased somewhat less rapidly than that of intermediate and capital goods;
however, the proportion of consumer go%ods in total manufacturing output is
still preponderant (55%). Increased pro-duction of consumer goods has been
stimulated mainly by rising domestic and export demand. In spite of the
rapid increase in the production of capital goods (such as machine tools,
electrical and transport equipment), Korea is still heavily dependent on
imports in this category. The growth of intermediate goods production has
contributed substantially to import substitution; the share of imports in the
total supply of intermediate goods fell from 43% in 1965 to 19% in 1968. The
share of heavy industry (chemicals,, netal products and machinery), in terms
of total value added, increased from 11.8% in 1960 to 28.9% in 1969.  Not
surprisingly, Korean manufacturing is becoming increasingly capital-intensive
as evidenced by the higher growth rate of gross manufacturing investment (48%~
during 1967-1969, in comparison with manufacturing employment (17%).
6.        Industry is predominantly privately owned.  The government owns only
about 5% of the total capital invested in manufacturing industry. There is a
tendency towards the concentration of industrial pnoduction in large enter-
prises, although small (less than 50 emp-loyees) and medium-sized (50 to 200
employees) enterprises are still important and account for 40% of industrial
output. Geographically, there is a heavy concentration in the two largest
urban centers, Seoul and Pusan, which together account for about one-half
of total industrial production.
7.        Government incentives.  The development of Korea's manufacturing
industry has relied mainly on private initiative, but government policies have
played an important role. The government encourages export-oriented enter-
prises. As in many countries, exemptions from import duties on raw materials
and intermediate goods used for making export products are given aa an induce-
ment to exporters. Profits earned from exports bear income taxes at 50% of
the normal rates. Another important poLicy instrument influencing industrial-
ization is long-term finance provided to industry by government-owned
specialized institutions at subsidized interest rates. The total of export
incentives in the form of tax concessions, import duty exemptions and interest
rates subsidies in 1968 was equivalent to W82 for each dollar earned, or 30%
of export value. These export incentives were partly or wholly offset
by the overvaluation of the Won exchange rate, Prohibition of and
quantitative restrictions on certain imports have also had the effect
of stimulating domestic production, but sometimes as the cost of high
prices to the domestic market, The system of import restrictions is
reasonably flexible and tariffs are generally lVwer (20% to 30%) than
in developing countries at similar levels of industrialization. The
foregoing suggests that Korean industry operates in reasonably



-3-
competitive conditions and the recent rapid gr gth of manufactured exports
reflects their international competitiveness. _
Financial Environment
8.        Interest rates.  Interest rates in the organized market are managed
by the Korean authorities. (See paragraph 12 below for comments on the
unorganized market.) After successive reductions, the current typical lending
rate of the commercial banks is 24h per annum, while the interest rates on
time deposits range from 12% per annum for 3-month deposits to 22.8i', for
12-month deposits.
9.       I'¶hile commercial bank loans bear high interest rates, certain indus-
tries have access to credit at preferential interest rates, mostly from fiscal
funds channeled by the specialized government financial institutions. Those
rates on domestic currency loans range from 12- p.a. for long-term loans to
priority industries to 23,i p.a. for working capital loans to other industries
At 20-2h4;' p.a. the domestic market interest rate on loans for private enter-
prises is still much higher than that on foreign loans (private loans and
suppliers' credit), generally at a nominal rate of around 87o  This wide
disparity has encouraged excessive medium-term borrowing from abroad by
private industry, in spite of the exchange risk. From 1962 to August 1969,
such foreign financing in the manufacturing sector amounted to $823 million
(or about 41% of total financing), of which the bulk came in the form of
private loans ($583 million). The effects on Korea's debt service burden
have prompted the government to impose restrictions on such borrowing. One
consequence of the restrictions has been an increase in the demand for KDFC'2
assistance. The government is also considering the introduction of an inte-
rest equalization tax to reduce the discrepancy between the cost of foreign
and domestic loans.
10.       Capital market.  The capital market in Korea still plays only a
minor role in channeling private savings into productive investment. The
volume and range of securities available on the Korea Stock Exchange remain
limited. Because of the existence of attractive alternative investments such
as curb market placements, bank time deposits and public bonds, the investing
public has little interest in the stock market; interest rates on private
loans, bank time deposits and public boncls are higher than the average yield
on stocks.  Moreover, companies prefer to remain closely held, in spite of the
tax advantages recently made available tc) public corporations as a measure to
encourage wider share ownership. Transactions are small in volume and
speculative in nature, largely confined to professional brokers and centering
on a few issues.
11.       The Government, realizing the excessive dependence of Korean enter-
Prises on loan capital (average debt/equity ratio is 3:1), the disadvantages
of the traditional family and closely-held companies and the need for
1/ Please see Economics Department Working Paper No. 86, "Industrial Policies
in Taiwan and Korea", of August 14, 1970, by Bela Balassa, transmitted to the
Txecutive Directors October 8, 1970.



- 4 -
mobilizing additional domestic resources, has tried to promote equity invest-
ment through the organized capital market.  In 1968, it promulgated the
Capital Market Promotion Law which established the Korea Investment Develop-
ment Corporation (KIDC) to engage in underwriting and security transactions,
and provided preferential corporate tax rates and special depreciation
allowances for "open" corp,)rations. The Government also approved the estab-
lishment of securities departments in commercial banks to enable them to
deal on the stock market. These measures are expected eventually to stimu-
late the capital market, although so far few results are apparent. In 1969,
KIDO underwrote 9 issues for a total amount of about W2 billion but
succeeded in placing less than 50% with the public.
12.       Money market.  There exists irn Korea a large unorganized (curb)
money market, with an estimated annual turnover of about $2 billion and loans
outstanding (as of March 1970) of about $250 million equivalent. Curb market
loans amount to about 17% of total commercial bank loans.  Although the
existence of a curb market is a common phenomenon in developing countries, the
size of the market in Korea is unusual and appears to be due partly to the
government's fiscal and financial policies.  The ma ii reasons for the large
size of this market are: (i) the non-av7ailability of remunerative short-term
credit instruments available to attract short-term savings; banks pay only
1% a month on 3-month time deposits, and no interest on deposits of less than
15 days; (ii) the r,latively low tax rate (16.5%) on interest income from
private loans, in comparison with corporate income tax of up to 49.5%; and
(iii) the recently implemented tight moniey policy, which has restricted bank
loans. About one half of the principal manufacturing enterprises in Korea
meet a part of their working capital loans from the curb market, at interest
rates ranging up to 5% a month.  KDFC, in consultation with the government,
is taking the lead in seeking to devise a mechanism which will mobilize
resources for productive enterprises more efficiently and economically than
the curb market (paragraph 38 below).
13.       The Korean Government is aware of the need both to stimulate the
capital market and to establish a viable organized money market. Further
improvements are currently under study, and various steps towards reorga-
nizing the stock exchange and the money rarket are contemplated. At the
request of the Government, an IFC mission visited Korea in November-December
1970 to assess the s9tuation and to discuss with the government KDFC's scheme
for the new financial institution referred to in the preceding paragraph. The
Government intends to implement the scheme and has requested IFCts participa-
tion. IFC sent another mission in March-April 1971 to work out with the
Government and KDFC a concrete proposal for establishing the new institution,
and to appraise the scheme.



III. KDFC'a ROLE IN THE ECONOMY
KDFC as a Source of Industrial Finance
14.       Other institutions in Korea.  KDFC is one of three specialized
institutions providing long-term development finance. Particulars of KDFC's
shareholders, board, organization, policies and resources are given in
Annexes 1 to 5, The other institutions are the Korea Development Bank (KDB)
and the Medium Industry Bank (MIB), both government-owned.
15.       The main source of long-term finance has been KDB which finances
both public and private sector projects acting largely as an intermediary for
channeling government funds, AID counterpart funds and foreign funds. The
Government has used KDB for implementing a variety of programs. Besides manu-
facturing, the sectors receiving KDB's assistance are mining, construction,
transportation, services and infrastructure, KDB has also been a principal
source of housing construction loans. KDB's outstanding portfolio of loans
and investments at year-end 1969 stood at W131 billion, of which W60 billi on
consisted of loans to and investments in the manufacturing sector. Of the
amount of W60 billion, Wl4.6 billion represented working capital loans. KDB';J
financing of the manufacturing sector in 1969 accounted for one-fourth of
total manufacturing investment in Korea. Besides fiscal funds obtained from
the Government, KDB derives its resources from debentures and deposits from
the public (although at interest rates higher than its lending rates), and
from borrowings abroad.
16.       MIB specializes in lending to enterprises employing not more tharn
200 employees, or having total assets not exceeding W50 million. In 1969
NIB1s lending represented one-fourth of the total outstanding loans to those
industries. As of December 1969, NIB's outstanding portfolio amounted to
W35.6 billion of which 36% was represented by loans for capital goods and
64% for working capital.
17.       Commercial banks, predominantly government-controlled, nominally
supply industry only with short-term loans up to one year, although in practicc
the term is often extended.  The banks require substantial collateral from thc
borrowers. KIDC, established in 1968, introduced underwriting to Korea in
1969 but its contribution tro equity financing and the growth of the capital
market has so far been modest.
18.       Industrial financing by KDFC.  KDFC, which made its first investment
decisions only in July 1966, is still relatively new and small in comparieor
with the Government-owmed KDB and INB. Total disbursements by KDFC in 1970 cI
about W3.3 billion (US$10.4 million equivalent) represented 2.7% of the esti-
mated gross domestic fixed capital inveEstment in manufacturing of W125 billio.
In the particular field of long-term lending to large and medium-scale indus-
tries, hcwever, the role of KDFC is already significant.  Its outstanding
portfolio of W5.7 billion as at December 31, 1970, represented about 10% of
the estimated total amount of outstanding loans for industrial capital goods



- 6 -
in Korea. It is clear that KDFC is able to compete for business successfully
against the larger institutions in spite of charging generally higher rates
of interest.
19.       While KDFC's quantitative contribution to Korea's economic growth
may never beco-me very large in relation to KDB's and MIB's, its qualitative
contribution is already significant and is likely to become more so, Both
directly by its work on clients' projects and indirectly by its example, it is
helping to raise project appraisal standards in Korea (see paragraphs 46 to
48 below) thus contributing to a more efficient allocation of resources. Most
important of all, KDFC's reputation for integrity appears to stand very high,
in both Government and private circles.
20.       Features of KDFC's operations.  KDFC's approvals sharply increased
in 1970, ics third year of operation. Total approvals during the year
amounted to W6.7 billions 38% more than bhe combined totals for 1968 and 1969.
Disbursements, however, are not expected to reflect that high level until
1971, because of the usual time lag between commitments and disbursements.  As
of December 31, 1970, total disbursements amounted to W5.7 billion against
cumulative approvals of W115 billion. Details of loans and investments are
given in Annexes 6 to 10, and the wore important aspects are discussed below.
21.       Sectoral distribution.  KDFC's portfolio is well diversified among
various industrial sectors. Exposure in the textile industry (including
synthetics), the most important in Korea, is high; about 30% of KDFC1s
portfolio is invested in it, But within that sector thu portfolio covers a
wide variety of operations.  Other sectors receiving KDFC's assis&vance are
paper products, rubber tires, glass, cement, plywood, basic netals, metal
products, electrical equipment and appliancee, containerized shipping, and
food and beverages. The company intends further to diversify its portfolio
by financing new manufacturing activities such as electronics, heavy machinery
and petrochemical products.
22.       The greater part of KDFCts lending and investment has been directed,
as a matter of deliberate policy, to export-oriented projects. (The impor-
tance of exports to Korea is referred to paragraph 3 above.) KDFC estimates
that in 1969, net foreign exchange earnings achieved by its clients amounted
to $16.8 million, in addition to a substantial sum in net foreign exchange
savings through import substitution.  NK  estimate is available, however, of
the proportion of such earnings and savings attributable to the projects
financed by KDFC, since most KDFC investments were for expansions.
23.       Size of loans.  There is a marked trend towards larger loans. Loans
over W150 million ($dO8,000), in relation to total lending, increased from 28%
in 1958 to 67% in 1969 and 87% in the period January/September 1970.  By
number, 14 loans out of 22 made during the first 9 months of 1970 were f6r
more than W150 million each. Available information on the projects in the
pipeline shows that the percentage of larger loans is likely to continue to
grow with the growth in the average size of industJrial establishments in
Korea. KDFC recognizes the need to avoid concentrating its resources on a



- 7 -
small number of clients, and to encourage! new entrepreneurs. Its Policy
Statement prohibits the company from committing to any single enterprise more
than 15% of the sum of KDFC's paid-in capital, free reserves and the govern-
ment loan. This limit is presently about W730 million ($2.4 million). KDFC
alone therefore cannot finance very large projects and has begun to seek
opportunities for joint financing. It has so far approved one such project,
in which it is in partnership with Korean and German interests.
24.       KDFC has approved four equity investments and six investments in
convertible debentures, for a total of W2.,267 million; this amountato about
11% of its total approvals of W11.5 billion, and to 40% of total Won approvals.
Equity investments made at a cost of W180 million, which are quoted on the
Stock Exchange, had a market value at December 31, 1970, of WM34 million. The
remaining equity investments and convertible debentures arenot quoted on the
Stock Exchange. It is evident that KDFC has made a start in providing finance
in the form of securities, in spite of the reluctance of closely-held Korean
companies to admit outsiders to a share in ownership. With the expected
improvement in the securities market and the inducements to Korean companies
to go public, KDFC expects to become more active in the field of equity
financing.
25.       Although KDFC is authorized to underwrite security issues, it has
not yet done so. As noted in paragraph 11 above, the government-owned KIDC
introduced underwriting operations to Korea in 1969, although with only
limited success. KDFC has stated its intention to enter progressively into
the underwriting field, when it can do so.
26.       Local currency and import financing.  At December 31, 1970, total
approvals of Won loans and investments nimbered 45 and amounted to W3.1
billion- foreign currency loans numbered 34 for an amount of w8.4 billion.
Won financing thus represents about 27% of total financing. This proportion
of local currency financing is expected, on the basis of the projections, to
remain for the period 1971-1975 at about the same level. The scope for WTon
lending is, in general, restricted by KDFC's practice, as matters of prudent
financial policy, of limiting its financing usually to one-half of total
project cost and of requiring the borrower to contribute at least one-third
of the capital required for the project. On the basis of experience during
the past year with KDFC projects requiring both foreign exchange and Won
financing, direct imports averaged about 45% of total project cost (or 51%, if
working capital is excluded); and KDFC has provided for such projects an
average of B5% of the import financing required, that is, 38% of total project
cost.  KDFC does not lend for working capital, except, in a few cases, in
conjunction with loans for capital goods.
27.       Past operations and future outLook.  KDFC's financing policies have
been justifiably cautious in its first three years of operation. KDFC's
portfolio is composed mainly of straight loans (89%) with the balance in share
investments and convertible debentures. The financing went to projects for
the expansion and modernization of existing firms to the extent of 87%, as
against 13% for new projects. This preponderance of lending to existing firms



- 8 -
reflects both the recent tendency of Korean industry to consolidate, and
KDFC's caution in its early years. The majority of financing of existing
firms involved expansion of production capacity to achieve an economic scale
of production and reduce production cost, or modernization of production
facilities b improve product quality and operational efficiency. KDFC has
not undertaken any promotional activities so far, partly because of staff
limitations in the build-up period, and partly because promotion was not
needed in the face of the large number of investment projects seeking finance
in Korea. KDFC has been operating in a seller's market and could be selective
in its choice of projects. This policy was a wise one for a development
finance company in its infancy. It has enabled KDFC to create a sound port-
folio in a short period. It has also earned KDFC a solid reputation for
soundness and efficiency.
28.       The company's management is preparing KDFC for an expansion of its
activities. It foresees that the expected elowing down of the growth rate of
the Korean economy may give promotic,1al work greater urgency and importance.
KDFC is taking steps to equip itself to provide technical assistance and
management consultancy services, initially to its client companies and sub-se-
quently to outside companies. To that end it plans to set up a new depart-
ment.  These serii_es would represent a specialized development of the advice
it is already giving clients in the course of project appraisal (paragraph
48). Korean industry stands in need of such services. The proposed expan-
sion of KDFC's activities into the fields of project promotion and management
consultancy are logical developments ancd should enable KDFC to enlarge its
qualitative contribution to economic devrelopment in Koi-ea.
KDFC as a Mobilizer of Industrial Finance
29.       Past efforts at resource mobilization.  A long-range objective of
KDFC is to mobilize capital not only trom its own shareholders and govern-
mental, international and bilateral sources, but also from private markets in
Korea and abroad. To date, however, the sources of KDFC's funds are limited
to its shareholders, the Government, the World Bank and USAID.  Except for a
USAID loan of $5 million forming part ofr KDFC's initial capitalizavion (but
since then reduced to $3 million 1/), KFC has depended until now entirely on
World Bank financing for its foreign exchange requirements. KDFC obtained
a line of credit for $5 million from Caterpillar Far East Ltd*, made effective
early in 1971. That credit will be available only for the import of spe-
cialized Caterpillar equipment from the United States and its use in meeting
KDFC's financing needs will be correspondingly restricted.
1/ Because AID considered the pace of cDmmitment to be too slow. The AID
loan was tied to U5.S procurement, while a large part of Korean industry's
demand for imports is directed to the very competitive Japanese market.



- 9 -.
30.       KDFC's domestic currency mobilization to December 31, 1970, consist-
of a subordinated government loan of W2,025 million, its share capital of
W1,485 million (including a 10% stock dividend) and retained earmings of Wl,196
million. The Government loan thus amounts to 40% of KD)C's WAon resources, -3sd
share capital and retained earnings amoumt to 60%. These resources have so
far been sufficient for its needs.  A change in that situation is now in signt.
In spite of the state of development of the capital market and of the interest
rate structure in the country, which are factors inhibiting efforts to mobill>se
local resources, KDFC plans to increase its share capital by 55% in 1972 and ry
25% in 1973, for a total additional amolmt of W1,578 million. The second iSsu,3
may be of preferred shares.
31.       Interest rates.  KDFC's lending rates are determined by its Board.
XDFC charges 10% per annum for loans denominated in foreign currency (with the
borrower assuming the exchange risk) andl 20% per annum for loans in Won. The
Won lending rate is 4% less than commercial bank rates, but several points
higher than the concessionary rates charged by KDB and MIB$, which range from
12% to 20% for long-term loans, with an average rate close to 12% for Won
loans. Although in the past KDFC has been under some pressure to lower its
Won currency lending rate, KDFC's Board,, while keeping th.e problem under
frequent review, has maintained the rate of 20%. Although that rate is highe;:
than those charged by other long-term lending institutions, it has not
adversely affected KDFC's business.
32.       KDFC's Board keeps the lending rates under constant review.  From
time to time the Board has a full-scale discussion of them., based on a care-
fully prepared staff paper, and takes inlto account such factors as the
general levels of interest rates in Korea, the cost of capital, the profit-
ability required to enable KDFC to raise new capital, inflation and rates
charged by competitors. The Board has so far seen no justification for
changing the Won lending rate of 20% p.a. In view of the care with which
KDFC's Board keeps the lending rate under review, there is no reason to
doubt that the rate fixed is appropriate.
33.       With inflation at a rate of about 10% p.a., KDFC's financial struc-
ture was set up to give it a spread of 16% p.a. on the government loan, when
its proceeds are invested. That spread has significantly helped KDEC to
maintain its profitability at the level it will need to attract new share
capital. The spread on foreign currency lending is 3.5% with the borrower
bearing the exchange risk.
34.       The high level of market interest rates in Korea is one of the
factors inhibiting the demand for securities. Other factors are the even more
attractive returns on such alternative investments as curb market placements,
government bonds (32%) and real estate. KDB has offered bonds to the public
to a total amount of 115 billion, at a nominal rate of 28% p.a.,(with
discount, the effective rate is 34-36% p.a.), but only W 4.4 billion was taken
up by the general public. The balance was subscribed by government institu-
tions. KDFC might usefully explore the possibility of guaranteeing the
principal and interest on bond issues made by its industrial clients; but such



- 10 -
an operation would be facilitated if KDFC had first made a small issue of its
own bonds (even at the cost of accepting a negative spread on the funds so
raised) and thus established its name in the market. The difficulties in the
way of a successful bond issue by either KDFC or a client should not be
underrated, given the present state of the Korean capital market, but KDFC is
giving thought to the possibilities.
35.       Resource mobilization at projeict level.  An analysis of 43 projects
shows that KDFC's commitments to thenm of W5,8 billion formed part of total
commitments for capital investmXent of WI.7.2 billion, the balance being
financed by the sponsors rf projects and from other sources. Thus, on average,
KDFC has financed about one-third of total project cost, KDFC frequently
requires its borrowers to increase their equity investment as a condition of
lending.
36.       Prospects for KDFCts mobilization efforts.  KDFC will have to
continue to rely heavily on the World Bank for the capital it needs to finance
imports. The management has indicated, however, that it intends to diversify
the sources of its financing to the best of its ability, and will seek loans
from such sources as Kreditanstalt fur Wiiederaufbau (KfW), the Asian Develop-
ment Bank (ADB) and the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ); it has received
approval from the government to make such efforts. As of December 31, 1970
KDFC's outstanding debt to the Bank ($8.2 million) represented about 33% of
total long-term capital employed (equity and outstanding long-term borrowing).
That proportion would rise to about 58% at year-end 1971 and 61% at year-end
1972.  The proportion of Bank funds might be reduced when KDFC obtained leans
from other sources.
37.       Por domestic currency, KDFC's mobilization efforts will continue for
the next few years to be through internal cash generation, the planned
increases in its share capital (referred to in paragraph 30 above) and,
perhaps, by ventures in underwriting. In addition, KDFC has taken the lead in
an effort to mobilize domestic resources, although for the use of industry in
general rather than for its own use, through the new financial institution
referred to in the following paragraphs.
38.       Proposal for a new financial institution.  In the light of the
shortcomings of the money and capital marketiref-erred to in paragraphs 10 to
12 above (e.g. scarcity of equity capital and the inadequate supply of short-
term funds at reasonable rates), KDFC sees a need for establishing a new
institution which would stimulate money and capital market development.
39.       At the invitation of the Government, an IFC mission visited Korea in
November/December to review problems of money and capital market development
and to advise in the establishment of the new institution. During the stay of
the mission, detailed proposals for such an institution were prepared. These
envisage the establishment of a privately-oriented institution which would
serve primarily as a financial intermedliary in both the money and capital
markets.  Such an institution could mace a very useful contribution by deve-
loping a market for short-term commerc-ial paper. It could also meet an urgent



need on the capital market side by helping private enterprises raise equity
and other funds through effective underwriting arrangements, by creating a
secondary market for the securities which it underwrites and by developing an
effective distribution system. The proposed institution would be established
together with Korean and foreign financial institutions, with KDFC owning
around 25% of total equity.
40.       The proposal for the new institution has the support of the Govern-
ment.  IFC is considering an investment in the new company's equity, a loan,
and assistance in making arrangements with other foreign investors for
additional equity and loan funds for the company. An IFC mission is now in
Seoul vorking on the details of the proposal. The new company is expected to
be established during the second half of 1971. By its active role as a pro-
ponent of the proposal, KDFC has given evidence of its intention to play an
important part in mobilizing domestic capital resources, for the use of the
industrial sector.
h1.       Technical contributions.  KDFC is a member of the Consultative Orga-
nization for Underwriting of Securities, which was created in 1969 as a per-
manent body for consulting on the organization of underwriting for the sale of
corporate and government securities.  Other members are KDB, KIDO, the Korea
Stockbrokers' Association and the five leading commercial banks.  KDFC also
participated in various extensive studies' on the capital and money markets in
Korea, intended to lead to measures to accelerate resource mobilization.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS AND CREDITWORTHINESS
Board,Management and Staff
42e       KDFC is well led and well managed.  Its Articles provide for a
Board of 13 directors. The present Board consists of 9 Korean directors
(including the President of KDFC), 3 directors representing the foreign share-
holders, and one representing IFC. Mr. Y. L. Chang has represented IFC on
KDFC's Board since inception of the company. The Chairman of the Board is
Mr. C. S. Hong, a prominent industrialist who was form&rly Chairman of the
Federation of Korean Industries. An Executive Committee consisting of four
directors including KDFC's President has been authorized by the Board to
approve individual investments up to $50C),100 equivalent. KDFC's President
oontinues to be Mr. C, EI  Kial a former  lovernor ef the Bank of Yorea.  He is
both familiar with the broad issues facing KDFC and knowledgeable about the
details of KDFC's operations. He firmly manages KDFC's operations. His
reputation and standing in Government circles and in the business community
are very high.  He is assisted by twn Vice Presidents, one supervising direct-
ly the In7estment Appraisal and the Planning and Research Departments, the
other the Operations and Administration Departments. Together with the
President, they form a strong management team. However, one of the two Vice
Presidents is likely to leave soon to become head of the proposed new finan-
cial institution referred to in paragraph 40. The President is actively seek-
ing a replacement of equal quality.



- 1  -
43.       KDFC has had since its inception the services of an Advisor,
Mr. C. L. Terrel, recommended by the Bank. He has made a valuable contribu-
tion to the company's internal organizations management decisions, staff
training and especially project appraisals. His contract, renewed once on
the initiative of KDFC, is due to expire in September 1971.
44.      KDFC's professional staff, presently totalling 32 apart from manage-
ment, is competent. A few members are outstanding. KDFC has been successful
in attracting qualified personnel, To supplement its experienced senior
staff, the company has followed a policy of recruiting promising young college
graduates and giving them systematic on-the-job training. There are presently
six such trainees who were expected to become professionals in March 1971.
KDFC intends to expand its professional staff at a rate of 10-15% a year, a
rate which it believes to be compatible with efficient absorption.
45.       In official and business circles, KDFC enjoys a reputation for
integrity in its dealings with clients.  The management has established and
enforces strict rules regarding the staff's relations with customers. The
management's practice is to maintain staff remuneration at a level sufficient
both to retain staff and to maintain higth morale and ethics. The current
scale of remuneration in force is about 10-20% higher than that of competing
institutions, and is automatically adjusted for increases in the cost of
living once a year. The morale of staff appears high and KDFC is confident
it can avoid undue wastage. Staff stabJlity is noticeable, with gradual
expansion and almost no turnover,
Project Appraisal and Supervision
46.       Project appraisal.  KDFC's appraisals are of consistently high
standard; the underlying investigation is thorough. In evaluating a project,
K)FC applies financial criteria which, while appropriate, are considered by
businessmen in Korea to be stringent. Economic criteria generally applied
relate to the impact of the project -n foreign exchange earnings or savings,
the creation of new empl5yment, the use of domestic raw materials, and tech-
nological benefits.  Until recently, KDFCIs appraisal reports have not paid
sufficient attention to the analysis of the international competitiveness of
projects, but after discussions with Bank staff this shortcoming has been
remedied.
47.       KDFC has four qualified engineers on its staff (as well as two eco-
nomists, five market analysts and four financial analysts) who review the
engineering aspects of projects with the help of two part-time advisors tc
KDFC, also qualified engineers.  Through its part-time advisors, KDFC is able
to tap the specialized expertise of the Korean Institute of Science and Tech-
nology, which includes in its membership prominent engineers and scientists.
KDFC generally undertakes a detailed technical analysis of projects. When a
project presents technical aspects with which the appraisal staff is not
familiar, KDFC requires the applicant to engage independent qualified consult-
ants, KDFC's appraisal reports now almost invariably cover all aspects of
projects very adequately.



- 13 -
48.       In various instances, KDFC has helped its clients modify and improve
projects in the course of the appraisal process. Out of 55 projects approved
to September 30, 1970, 15 had been modified at KDFC's suggestion. These
modifications concern the financing plan for the project, management arrange-
ments and technical aspects4. KDFC's advice directly to its clients represents
another aspect, although unquantifiable, of its assistance in economic deve-
lopment. Its adoption and maintenance of high standards of project evalua-
tion also has an indirect effect; knowledge of the standards observed has
spread among entrepreneurs, and has exercised a beneficial effect on the
preparation of projects for submission to KDFC.
l49.      Loan supervision. Owing to the need to concentrate in the past on
the processing of loan applications, and because of the newness of its port-
folio, KDFC began only recently to pay c:Lose attention to loan supervision.
The number of professional staff in the Operations Department (which is
responsible for that work) has been increased recently from five to seven.
Because the work of that Department is not restricted to loan supervision,
however, but includes part of the appraisgal process, further expansion of the
staff is necessary. The Department does not yet have an engineer to partici-
pate in factory inspections. Systematic supervision procedures have yet to
be fully established.  The follow-up worlk, adequate while the portfolio was
very small, must now be improved. The management intends to strengthen the
Operations Department not only to improve loan supervision but also to make
available the management consultancy services referred to in paragraph 28
above, until the new consultancy department is set up.
Financial Situation and Creditworthiness
50.       KDFCIs financial position is sound.  Income statements and balance
sheets are summarized in Annexes 11 and 12. Total assets increased by 24%
in 1969 and by 55% during 1970. KDFC's term debt outstanding as of Dec-
ember 31, 1970 amounted to W4.9 billion of which about 41% consisted of the
subordinated government loan. The Bank Loan Agreement (622-KO) limits
KDFC's borrowings to a maximum of three times its equity plus that part of the
Government subordinated loan not repayable before repayment of the Bank loan.
The total long-term debt/equity ratio was 1.9:1 as of the same date, and on
the basis of the Bank's formula was 0.65:1. Reserves and retained earnings
increased from 40% of share capital in 1968 to 79% in 1969 and 85% as at
December 31, 1970.
51.       Largely because of the spread on the government loan funds,
referred to in paragraph 33 above, KDFCts profitability has been relatively
highe Net profits increased from W436 million in 1968 to W519 million in
1969, and W604 million in 1970. The 1970 results represented a return of
.7% on share capital and 21.1% on year-end net worth. These rates of
return, although prima facie high, are diminished in real terms by persistent
inflation; nor are they high in relation to expected returns in Korea on
alternative investments. While until 1969 KDFC's income derived mainly from
interest income on its deposit funds, 53% of the income for 1970 derived from
the investment portfolio. From the 1969 and 1970 profits, KDEF has declared



- 14 -
each year a 20% dividend (10% stock and 10% cash) and envisages the same
pattern for the next few years. KDFt's financial position and prospects are
sound, and KDFC is a creditworthy institution.
Quality of Portfolio
52.       KDFC's portfolio is too recently acquired to support detailed com-
ments on the repayment record of KDFC's clients. Few repayments have yet
becaae due. Only one loan has been rescheduled. The client (a fluorescent
lamp manufacturer) met financial difficulties arising from high-cost borrow-
ings in the curb market. That problem is in process of solution. Of the 55
projects financed, about one-half are still in construction.  KDFC's out-
standing portfolio at December 31, 1970 vras W 5.7 billion or about 55% of total
commitments as of the same date. KDFC's loans generally are comfortably
secured by first mortgages on the new assets and on other existing assets; in
some cases the company also requires the personal guarantee of the promoters
or principal owners. Given KDFC's careful selection of projects and high
appraisal standards, and the collateral security obtained, there is no reason
to doubt that KDFC's portfolio is sound. The appraisal mission to KDFC in
October 1970 visited a number of KDFC's projects and judged them to be good.
Even the two problem projects appeared tc) have good prospects of recovery.
Relations with Government and Industry
53.       KDFC remains under criticism in some business quarters for slowness
in taking investment decisions and for setting its project standards too high.
KDFC presently takes on the average from two to three months to process a
loan application, which is not slow cssidering the thoroughness with which
the appraisal is made. Its appraisal standards are high, but it would be
detrimental to its own interests and to those of Korea if it were to lower
them. Rather, it should follow its chosen course of seeking consistently to
raise them. Despite some criticism, KDF4 appears to have gained the confi-
dence and respect of both Government and industry.
54.       KDFC's success is partly attrilbutable to the Government's under-
standing of KDFC's problems, support for its activities, and abstention from
interference in its operations. KDFO operates within the framework of Govern-
ment policies and guidelines regarding industrial development and finance, but
otherwise is free to set its own operational policies. Apparently no loan or
investment decision has been made under the pressure of Government. Another
indication of KDFC's independence is that although the Government has at
least once expressed a desire to see KDFC lower its domestic currency lending
rate and relax its project standards, KDFC has decided to maintain both.
KDFC is in close touch with all government agencies related to industrial
finance such as the Economic Planning Board, the Ministry of Finance and the
Bank of Korea, especially regarding the scheme KDFC currently has under study
for establishing a new financing institution. KDFC's management briefs the
President of the Republic once a year, and thus is given the opportunity both
to present KDFC's achievements and problems and to hear the Government's views
at the highest level. The Government recognizes KDFC's importance and value,
present and perspective, as a development institution with high standards of
integrity, as a channel for attractLng capital from the Nbrld Bank and other
lenders, and as a potential mobilizer of domestic resources.

V. KDFC's PRCSPECTS
Prospects for Korean Industry
55,       KDFC's future development is naturally linked to the Korean econoary,
especially the manufacturing sector. AE stated earlier in this report, the
Korean economy has recently experienced phenomenal growth, with manufacturing
industry playing the leading role.  There is little doubt that economic growtl-
will be slower in the next few years. The growth of manufacturing output is
expected to slow down from a rate of 22% annually during the past five years
to about 15% during the next five years, partly because the base now is much
larger. ExpoIts of manufacturing products may grow at perhaps 18% annually
during the period 1971-1976, compared with the 37% average annual growth of
recent years. The probable slow-down of export growth is due to rapidly
increasing domestic demand and expected resistance to further expansion in
export markets abroad, particularly in the U.S., which buys one-half of Korea';
exports, and in Japan, which buys 20%.  The Third plan for 1972-1976, recently
drafted, sets up an export target of $3.5 billion in 1976, of which more thao
80% in manufactured goods. This assumes an annual growth rate of exports
slightly above 20%. The gradual shift of manufacturing industry toward inter-
mediate and capital goods production (with emphasis on shipbuilding, heavy
rnachinery and steel) is likely to continue with the implementation of the
Third Plan.
KDFC'g Business Forecast
56.       A forecast of approvals, commitments and disbursements from 1970-
through 1975 is given in Annex 13. In projecting its future lending opera-
tions KDFC has taken into account the likely changes in the pattern of Korenii
manufacturing industry. The tentative lending program for the next two yearz
places emphasis on sectors producing capital and intermediate goods. In-
creased lending is likely to enterprises producing chenical and petrochemical.,
glass and stone, metal,machinery, electrical and electronic products, while
the proportion of lending to the textile industry falls.
57.       Despite the probable slowdown in the growth rate of the Korean
economy, the expected levels of investment in the industrial sector should
maintain demand for long-term financing at a high level throughout the period
1971-1976, In particular, if the Governsment maintains, as expected, tight
control over the inflow of foreign loans, KDFC is likely to berefit, and its
business prospects remain good,  The future volume of the company's business
wi1ll continue to be largely a function of the availability of resources.
KDFC's projections for the period 1971-1975 show only a modest increase in
total annual approvals of loans and equity investments from the 1970 level of
about $22.1 million equivalent to $29.1 million in 1975.  This represents, for
the five-year period, a growth rate in annual approvals of about 6%, which is
small in comparison with the expected annual increase in manufacturing invest--
ment in Korea. KDFC's rrojections of operations, which were conditioned by



- 16 -
KDFC's assessment of resources likely to be available, appear to be delib-
erately conservative. KDFC may well exceed the forecasts, if its efforts to
raise additional capital from sources otlher than the Bank are successful.
58.       Won financing in relation to total financing for the projected
period will remain at a level of about 27%, as in the past. Equity invest-
ments (not including convertible debentures) are expected to increase from
the present annual level of about W150 million to W550 million in 1975,
representing about 7% of total financing, KDFC has indicated it will try to
make as much as possible of its Won lending in the form of convertible deben-
tures, although this category of loans has not been distinguished in the
projections. In the past, equity investments and convertible debentures have
accounted for 11% of total financing and 40% of Won financing by KDFC; these
proportions are likely to increase in the future.
Resource Requirements
59.       Local currency sources.  KDF`Cs total commitments of domestic
currency from 1971 through 1975  are projected at W11,077 million.  Its Won
resources at December 31, 1970 amounted to W4.8 billion (including the Govern-
ment loan of W2 billion), of which the uncommitted balance was W1,914
million 1/, enough--to cover KDFC's Won requirements up to the end of 1972. -Won
resources for 1972-1975 are expected to come from repayments, retained earn-
ings and the two successive share capital increases which KDFC plans for 1972
and 1973. The projected sources for Won funds through 1975 are as follows:
Uncommitted Won resources at
December 31, 1970                W 1,914 million 1/    16.2
Capital increase (1972)                903  It             7.7
Capital increase (1973)                675   t             5.8
Won loan collections (1971-1975)      ,548   "            38.8
Retained earnings (1971-1975)      _ 3,694   "            31.5
1l1,734 million      100.0
Or the basis of KDFC's forecasts, it is unlikely to need additional Won
resources before the end of 1972. It wELs, however, impressed upon KDFC that
it should raise substantial additional Eihare capital as soon as possible, in
order to enable it to increase the size of its operations, in view of the
increasing average size of enterprises in Korea, and to permit it to become
more active in equity financing and underwriting. Moreover KDFC's share-
holders are the beneficiaries of relatively cheap funds supplied by the
Government and the Bank. This view has been pressed on KDFC over a period,
and in the course of negotiations of the proposed loan KDFC gave assurances on
its plans for raising additional equity capital from its shareholders in the
amounts of W903 million in the fLrst half of 1972 and W675 million in 1973,
referred to above. If the issue proposed for the first half of 1972 is
successful, KDFC will have doubled its initial paid-in share capital within
the space of five years.

60,       Fore!.,9gn currency sources. Commitments of foreign exchange for lzi'
and 1972 are projected  t  )iL3 ilion.  KDFCrs total foreign exchange
resources, $28 million as at December 3L, 1970, ara expected to be fully
committed around June 1971. The foreyin exchange resource gap over the nrc'7
two years is therefore about $40 million. Of thet amount the $5 million loan
from Caterpillar Far East Ltd. became effective early in 1971, although its
usefullness will be limited by its restrictive terms. The Bank has emphasized
to KDFC the desirability of diversifying the sources of its foreign exchango
funds and of rnducing the Bankts proportionate exposure in KDFC, and in the
course of negotiations received confirmation that KDFC will approach KfW of
Germany and the Industrial Bank of Japan in April 1971, with a view to
exploring the possibility of loans. KDFC is also considering approaching the
ADB at a later date,  The prospects for KDFC1s obtaining loans from one or
more of these institutions are good.  Meanwhile, a Bank loan of $30 million i-
proposed, which will make a substantial contribution to KDFC's capital
requirements for the next two years whi:le not relieving it of the need to seek
other sources of funds. A schedule of estimated disbursements of the propose"
loan is given in Annex 14.
Projected Financial Results
61.       Projected balance sheets through 1975 are shown in Annex 15.  On tile
basis of the forecast volume of business, KDFC's total assets would increaso
from aboutjr-8,018 million at the end of 1970 to TAT37,329 million at the end o2
1975. The loan and equity portfolio is estimated to increase from W5,662
million in 1970 to W33,660 million in 1975, and total long-term outstanding
debt is expected to grow from W4,925 million in 1970 to 1W28,306 million in
1975. The ratio of total long-term debt (including the government subordina-
ted loan) to equity is projected to increase from 1.9:1 in 1970 to 3.5:1 in
1975. The debt/equity ratio as defined.in the Bank Loan Agreement will rise
from 0.65:1 in 1970 to 2.77:1 in 1975. The contractual limit is 3:1.
62.       Projected income statements for the period 1970-1975 are given in
Annex 16.  KDFC's profits after tax are: expected to grow from W604 million Ln
1970 to W1,447 million in 1975, while the rate of return on average net
worth will range between 19el% and 21.4% during the sare period.  KDFC
receives a spread of 16% on the government loan and 09% on its second Bank  n  ,t
In the projections, KDFC has ass'imed that the existing lending rate on
foreign exchange subloars will not be changed but that the lending rates on
Won loans will decrease gradually to 15;% in 1974.  This assumption does not
reflect an intention to lower KDFC's rate; it is,rather, a conservative
assumption made in the light of the Governmentts wish to influence interest
rates downward.  Administrative costs are foracast to increase at an averaae
rate of 25% per annum, but in relation to average total assets will decrease
from 2.9% in 1970 to 1.3% in 1975. A provision for doubtful loans and
investments is included, calculated at 2% of the increment in the outstandingw
portfolio at the end of each year.  Dividends on KDFC's ordinary shares are
assumed to remain constant at 20% (half in cash and half in shares) and div.-
dends on preferred shares (to be issuecd in 1973) are forecast at 15% in 19711
and 1975. The pay-out ratio would be about 26% in 1970 and 31% in 1975. On



- 18 -
the basis of the projected dividend policy, and taking into account the pro-
posed two issues, the book value of KDFC's shares will stabilize between 193%
of par value at the end of 1970 and 190% in 1975 on the basis of the increased
share capital.
63.       Projected cash flow statements for the years 1970-1975 are given
in Annex 17. These and the forecast income stateTients indicate an adequate
debt service cover during the projected period. Annual interest payments
throughout the period range from 28% to 52% of KDFC's annual profits before
financial expenses. Principal repayments by KDFC range from 34% to 68% of
annual collections.  The overall debt servicecover will be 3.9 times in 1970,
2.1 times in 1972, 1.6 times in 1975 and is expected not to fall below 1.5
times for the life of the loan.  Prinnipal repayments by KDFC in respect of
the government loan will start from 1979. A tabulation of financial forecasts
appears in Annex 18.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
64.       KDFC's contribution to total investment in the private secto- is
quantitatively still small, but it has been growing and is expected to contirAue
to do so. Qualitatively, KDFC is playing an increasingly important role in
channeling long-term finance to economically sound investments. ODFC's pro-
ject appraisal work is of a high standard and has already had a significant
educational impact, Its follow-up work, while appropriate for a small port-
folio, now needs improvement and is receiving increasing attention from the
management.
65.       KDFC's record of domestic resource mobilization to date has not
been significant, since it began operations only in 1968. KDFC has given evi-,
dence, however, of a firm intention to take an important part in mobilizing
resources for industrial investment by sponsoring a new financial intermediary
to operate both in the short-term money market and the securities market.
66.       KDFCts performance to date has been very satisfactory.  In less than
three years it hes succeeded in building up an efficient organization, a
competent staff and a sound portfolio. EDFC is now preparing to broaden its
activities into the fields of project promotion, underwriting, technical
assistance and consultancy services.
67.       KDFC's prospects look good.  Despite being lower than those of
recent years, planned rates of manufacturing investment and growth are still
relatively high and the company should ha,ve nn difficulty in attaining the
forecast volume of business.  Its profitability should remain high and its
financial position sound. The company is likely to be able to raise additional
equity as needed to finance its expansioii. Its pla-ns for increasing share
:apital in early 1972 and in 1973 appear adequate.



- 19 -
68,       The Bank remains the most important source of funds for KDFC. The
company however is seeking to diversify its foreign exchange resources. KDFC
remains a creditworthy and suitable recipient for the proposed third loan.
The only other uncommitted foreign exchange loan presently available is that
of $5 million from Caterpillar Far East Ltd. In the tw' year period to the
end of December 1972, KDFC will need about $41 million in foreign exchange to
cover its projected commitments for financing imports. It is recommended that
the Bank make KDFC a third loan of US$30 million.
69.       Under the second Bank Loan Agreement, the free limit was US$300,000.
Of the 22 projects totalling US$12.6 million credited to the lean account as
of October 31, 1970, 15 projects amounting to US$11.1 million or 88% of the
total amount have been reviewed by the 'Bank. In view of the competence of
KDFC's management and staff, and of the high quality of appraisal work, an
increase in the free limit is justified. On the basis of the projects being
processed by KDFC, it is estimated that, with a free limit of US$500,000,
about three-quarters (by amount) cf the loans using Bank funds would go to
projects requiring prior approval by the Bank.  It is recommended, therefore,
that the free limit be raised to US$500,000 equivalent, with a limit on the
aggregate amcunt to be used for projects below the free limit equivalent to
25% of the proposed loan (US$7.5 million). It is also proposed that the
contractual limit on the debt/equity ratio be retained at 3. The other terms
of the loan should be those normally dp:plied to development finance companies,
including the standard commitment charge.

KOREA DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
Statement of Policy
(Adopted by the Board of Directors on April 25, 1967
and amended on February 29, 1968)
The Korea Development Finance Corporation, whose object is to
promote the expansion of private enterprise in the Republic of Korea,
will be guided by the policies set forth below:
I. The Scope of Investment Activities
1) KDFC will invest only in productive enterprises. While its
primary activity will be manufacturing and processing industry,
it may invest also in other types of enterprises, including
transport, tourism, and large-scale commercially oriented
agriculture. However, trade, real estate and small-scale
agriculture will be excluded.
2) KDFC will finance only private enterprises which are properly
organized and managed. KDFC will not invest in undertakings
which are Government-owned and operated, but a Government
holding of not more than 15;J of the voting stock of a private
enterprise shall not make such enterprise ineligible for finan-
cial assistance from KDFC. KDFC will finance both new enter-
prises and existing ones for expansion or improvement.
3)  In its operations, KDFC will give due regard to the Government's
general economic plans and policies.  The following categories
of industries will receive high priority, in accordance with
the Government economic policies and objectives:
a) export industries;
b) import-substitute industries;
c) industries producing raw materials necessary for production
of export commodities and imnport-substitutes;
d)  indigenous local industries which have special advantage in
comparative costs and potential marketability in foreign
markets;
e) participation or assistance in the turn-over of the
Government-owned industries to private ownership.
4) KDFC will assist private enterprises in the following ways:
a) medium and long-term loans;



Annex 4
Page 2
b) equity participation (through undbrwriting, conversion
rights, direct participation in share capital or other-
wise);
c)  guarantee of payment for machinery and equipment imported
or otherwise;
d)  guarantee and underwriting of corporate securities;
e) technical and managerial consultant services; and
f) any other appropriate mannero
5)  KDFC will seek through its operation, to broaden the owner-
ship of private securities in Korea.
6) KDFC's financial assistance will be primarily for expenditures
for fixed assets. KDFC will, however, consider requests for
permanent working capital in conjunction with its financial
assistance for such capital expenditures.
7)  KDFC will study periodically the trend of over-all industrial
development and investment opportunities in the private sector
in cooperation with research institutes for promotion of new
enterprises or expansion of the existing ones.
II. Basis for Investment Decisions
8)  KDFC will make investment decisions only on the basis of sound
investment criteria and standards, and will provide financial
assistance only to those projects which are financially and
economically sound and technically feasible.  Special attention
will be given to the ability of management and the profitability
of the enterprise.
III. Diversification of Portfolio
9) KDFC will diversify its portfolio in order to maintain a
reasonable level of risk.
10)  KDFC will not provide financial assistance of less than the
Won equivalent of $50,000.  The maximum financial commitment
in whatever form., including loan, share capital or guarantee
or any combination thereof, that KDFC may make to any single
enterprise will not exceed 15, of the total of IDFC's paid-in
capital, free reserves and Government loan of 1968.



Annex 4
Page 3
11) KDFC will not commit to any single enterprise in form of share
capital more than 10% of KDFC's paid-in capital and free
reserves. The aggregate equity investment of KDFC at any time
will not exceed the total of its paid-in share capital and
free reserves.
12)  In undertaking large-size projects, IDFC will seek cooperation
with other financial institutions, both domestic and foreign.
IV. Turm-over of Portfolio
13)  In order to recover its resources for new commitments and to
encourage widespread ownership of private securities, KDFC
will revolve its portfolio whenevrer it can do so on satisfactory
terms.  In selling an investment it will pay due regard not only
to its own interests but also to the interests of other partic-
ipants in such investment, as aliso to the interest of the
concern whose shares are involved1.
VI Relationship with Enterprises Financed
14) KDFC will not take a controlling interest in any enterprise in
which it has invested, or any other interest which would give
it primary responsibility for management, except that in the
case of jeopardy, it may take such action as may be necessary
to protect its interest. To this end it will not take up more
than 25% of the share capital of an enterprise, except as the
result of an underwriting commitment undertaken in the expect-
ation that the investment would in fact be within the limit
cited.
15) In accordance with normal banking practice, KDFC will require
its borrowers to provide and to maintain adequate security,
to keep records and accounts in accordance with sound
accounting practices, and to furnish whatever information on
their operations and accounts KDFC deems desirable. KDFC will
take the right to inspect the enterprises it finances as well
as their operations and accounts.
16)  Business secrets and other information furnished by applicants
or clients will be treated as confidential.
Ir. Financial Guide-Lines
17) KDFC will lend and invest its resources in such a way as to
maintain the value of its capital. KDFC will pass to its
clients any foreign exchange risk it assumes or find other
suitable means to cover it.



Annex 4
Page 4
18) KDFC will not incur any debt (not including as debt the loan
made by Korean Government in 1968) in excess of three times
the aggregate of its paid-in capital, free reserves and the 1968
Giovernment loan outstanding.
19)  KDFC will maintain accounting records adequate to reflect its
business operations in accordance with sound and generally
accepted international accounting practices and standards.
KDFC will employ qualified and independent public accountants
to audit its books and certify lthe accounts annually.
VII. Profits and Their Distribution
20) KDFC will seek to develop earniings sufficient to cover expenses
and taxes, to provide reserves adequate to the size and risks of
its portfolio and to protect its equity against erosion and to
pay satisfactory dividends. It will seek profits on its equity
investments and will impose interest rates, fees and other
charges for its loans and services which will permit it to
achieve that level of profitabi:Lity. It will build and maintain
reserves consistent with sound financial management. It will
set aside each year from net income before tax the amount
required by law as the legal reserve. In addition, it will
accumulate other reserves, including reserve for losses, as
considered prudent by the Board of Directors.
WEIl. Staff
21) KDFC will build up a technicallhr qualified staff capable of
carrying the responsibilities whlich KDFC's objectives create,
and able to provide the services to clients which those
objectives call for.
IX. Revision of Policies
22)  Any proposal to revise this Statement of Investment and
Operational Policies shall be considered by the Board of
Directors only after each member has been given an adequate
opportunity to study and comment on the proposal, and it shall
be approved at a meeting of the Board of Directors by two-
thirds of all directors.
