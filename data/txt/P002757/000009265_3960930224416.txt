MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
FOR A RAILWAYS RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Credit to Tanzania
for SDR 56.1 million (US$76.0 million, equivalent) are submitted for your approval.
The proposed Credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity, and
would assist in financing the restructuring of the operations and organization and
the rehabilitation of the assets of Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC), which is
a major part of the transport network of Tanzania and the region.   The total
project cost is US$275.2 million and will be parallel financed by AfDF (US$31.2
million), CIDA (US$10.3 million), EDF (US$18.0 million), XfW (US$18.3 million), ODA
(US$8.5 million) and WFP (US$3.3 million).  TRC would finance US$109.6 million
(96S) of the local costs of the project out of its cashflows. The proposed IDA
Credit would be passed on to TRC at a fixed interest rate of 11?, repayable over
20 years, including a grace period of five years.  TRC will bear the foreign
exchange risk.
2.    Background. TRC enjoys a strategic geographic location in Tanzania. The TRC
system links virtually all the major urban centers of Tanzania, traverses parts of
the country accounting for over 402 of agricultural output and most of the
country's exports and is a major artery for transit traffic from the neighboring
landlocked countries of Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda and the eastern part of Zaire. It
is, under efficient operating conditions, the most cost-effective means of
transport of bulky goods over the long distances that are characteristic of
Tanzania's exports and of major inputs for agriculture and industry such as
petroleum products, cement and fertilizer. However, utilization of its capacity
is only about 5O0 of what it can achieve under reasonably efficient operating
conditions. From a peak of about 1.6 million tons of freight traffic in the early
19709, it has declined to about 0.9 million tons currently, despite considerable
investments in locomotives and wagons. Similarly, passenger movements increased
sharply between 1981 and 1983 as a result of substantial investments in passen-
ger coaches, but its effective capacity has declined sharply since then to pre-
1981 levels. As the Tanzanian economy has responded positively to the substantial
improvements in economic management instituted since 1986 under the Economic
Recovery Program (ERP), TRC's poor performance has become an increasing constraint
on economic growth. Significant stockpiles of cotton for export, for which road
transport is unfeasible and uneconomic, have been built up and a large proportion
of other export traffic, as well as bulk inputs like fertilizer and fuel, have been
diverted to roads. The total cost to the economy of stockholding and diversion of
traffic that an effectively performing railways would have been able to handle is
currently estimated at US$40 million per annum.   Also,  Tanzania can earn
potentially US$55 million to US$75 million (12Z-18Z of current export earnings)
from transit traffic compared to about US$25 million currently.   The cost-
competitiveness of Tanzania as a transit country and thus its ability to realize
this potential depends critically on TRC's operating effectiveness. In addition
to its unsatisfactory operating performance, TRC's financial performance has been
poor. Its assets are currently valued, on a gross replacement cost basis, at about
US$550 million equivalent, but it earns little return on this and is incapable of
maintaining it in good condition, let alone provide for its replacement. Although,
mandated to be run as a commercial organization, TRC has been more or less
technically bankrupt since 1986. It is now also insolvent with major suppliers
threatening to stop supplying essential operating inputs unless overdue credits are
settled.



3.    The main causes of TRC's poor operating performance aret (a) lack of
effective maintenance systems and capabilities which htss led to sharp deterioration
in the condition of its assets: (b) poor management of traffic operations which has
resulted in severe underutilization of available assets; (c) an organizational
structure which severely constrains effective decision-making and under which
little authority is delegated to line managers; (d) significant overmanning which
taxes the capacity of a small management team to exercise effective control over
staff productivity; and (e) severe erosion of workers' earnings which has seri-
ously undermined discipline and handicaps TRC's ability to recruit skilled staff.
Exacerbating these deficiencies is a highly ineffective system for the regulation
of TRC activities.  Firstly, there is no performance expectation of TRC.  The
Railways Act provides that TRC should earn a reasonable rate of return on its
assets to be specified by Government. No rate has ever been specified. Secondly.
TRC has limited and ambiguous powers to perform effectively. The Railways Act
provides that TRC should have minor powers over its tariff levels and structure,
its organizational structure and manpower levels; major powers over both its price
and cost structure are granted in the Act to Government. This has resulted in few
and generally delayed increases in its tariffs and has inhibited its management
from undertaking needed restructuring of its costs. Finally, TRC's Board operates
under the same institutional constraints as TRC management, is selected more for
interests represented than competency and consequently is ineffectual. TRC's poor
financial performance is due to three main causes: (a) high variable costs and the
underutilization of its capacity due to inefficient operations; (b) low unit
tariffs due to tight controls on its tariffs; and (c) the persistent and increasing
losses incurred by the roads and hotel and catering services operated by it. As
a result of these factors, TRC's total contribution margin has been insufficient
to cover its fixed operating costs and debt service obligations.
4.    Government recognizes the deficiencies both in its system for regulating TRC
operations and in TRC's management and operations and supports a comprehensive
restructuring program to address these weaknesses under which (1) the legal
framework governing TRC's operations would be clarified to provide TRC with clear
overall commercial objectives and unambiguous powers to achieve these objectives;
(ii) the internal organization of TRC would be restructured to support a new
performance orientation; and (iii) the backlog of deferred maintenance evident in
all classes of railways assets would be made good to prevent their total loss or
avoid their significantly more expensive replacement. Specific important actions
taken to date to implement this strategy includes (a) the approval by Government
of average increases in freight tariffs and passenger fares of 702 and 38S,
respectively, in March 1991, to start the process of restoring the level of tariffs
and fares to full cost recovery levels; (b) the decision by Government in March
1991 that TRC divests itself of any responsibility for the management or operation
of the loss-making roads services and hotels and catering services in order to
focus on the railways service; (d) a significant start by TRC on reducing the level
of overmanning through the retrenchment of 112 of the total labor force over the
last six-month of 1990 followed by the issuance of termination notices to another
5? of its workforce in the first six months of 1992; (e) the institution of
operational objectives and targets for the system's managers and a successful start
on the first phase of a program to improve operating efficiency; (f) the issue by
Government of a Ministerial Directive and the execution of a Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) or performance contract between Government and TRC setting TRC
clear financial and service objectives and granting it the following powers to
achieve these objectives: ti) to adjust its tariffs with such frequency and
magnitude as it considers commercially necessary; (Ui) to make investments it



considers appropriate subject only to an overall debt-to-equity limitation and
submission of economic and financial justification to Government for any investment
in excess of US$2 million equivalent; (iv) to restructure its internal organization
as it considers to be commercially appropriate, except if this involves creation
of new non-railways entities or amalgamation with an unrelated entity; (v) to
reduce its staff by any amount it considers appropriate to achieve its efficiency
and comuercial objectives; and (vi) to pay salaries, bonuses and incentives
payments as it considers commercially prudent, without reference to Government.
5.          TRC has enjoyed considerable donor support since its establishment in
1977. The key donors active in TRC have been AfDB, Belgium, CIDA, DANIDA, the EEC,
KfW and ODA.   The Bank Group's first involvement in TRC was in 1986, when it
prepared a report that formed the basis for donor co-ordination in assisting to
rehabilitate TRC's assets under an Emergency Rehabilitation Program (EP). The EP
was designed to increase TRC's effective capacity to support the expected growth
in output under the ERP . The extensive external assistance to TRC has had little
effect in arresting the secular decline in its performance largely because such
support has not been conditioned on measures to change the regulatory framework for
TRC operations and has focussed on supporting the maintenance and acquisition of
physical assets rather than their effective utilization.
6.     Proiect Objectives and Rationale for IDA Involvements  The main objectives
of the project are to (i) strengthen the organization of TRC, eliminate regulatory
bottlenecks to its effective operations and set it on a path of a commercially
viable entity; and (ii) rehabilitate infrastructural assets, replace obsolete and
uneconomic operational assets and provide limited new investments consistent with
the prospects for growth in traffic. IDA has played a leading role in assisting
Government to formulate this strategy, which is based on the lessons learnt from
both the EP and the Bank Group's experience with railways projects in the region
in the last decade.   IDA's continued role in the Implementation of the project,
particularly its institutional dimensions and in co-ordination of the donors, is
viewed as pivotal to its success by both the Government and the donors.
7.     Project  Description:    The  proposed  project  would  consist  of  (a)
rehabilitation of track, locomotives, telecommunications systems, wagons aud
coaches and replacement of life-expired maintenance equipment, computer equipment,
coaches and vehicles; (c) organizational support and training to strengthen
management systems and staff capacity in all functional areas; and td) support for
improvements in the working environment for the TRC workforce. The total cost of
the project is estimated at US$275.2 million, with a foreign exchange component of
US$160.6 million (58Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A.  Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule of
the proposed IDA Credit are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing
events is shown in Schedule C. The status of Bank Group operations in Tanzania is
presented in Schedule D. A map (IBRD Map 22878) is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 9449-TA dated May 24, 1991 is also attached.
8.    Actions Agreed.  During negotiations, agreement was reached with Government
and TRC that: (a) TRC shall earn a rate of return on its total capital employed of
at least 15 in its fiscal years 1992, 1993 and 1994 and at least 20X for each
fiscal year thereafter; (b) all investments outside of the project in excess of
US$2.0 million equivalent be implemented only after consultation with IDA; (c) TRC
shall review annually with IDA, by October 31, its investment plans for the ensuing
fiscal years, ensuring that all items in such plans are subject to a prior economic



and financial justification;  (d) TRC shall furnish annually by not later than
November 30, a plan for the scrapping of wagons for the following year and
implement such plan taking IDA's views into account; (e) TRC's accounts receivables
be no greater than 45 days of annual revenues in any of its fiscal years during the
project period and that it submits to IDA, semi-annually, an aged analysis of its
accounts receivable; (f) by December 31, 1992, TRC shall have leased out its hotels
and franchised the catering services on its trains and shall also have completed
the transfer of operational, managerial and financial responsibility for its roads
services tc an independent operator; (g) TRC shall review annually with IDA the
rehabilitation program for locomotives, the management development program and the
program for supervisory level staff development and support; (h) TRC shall contract
out the operation and management of the quarry to be established under the project;
(i) TRC shall adopt, by January 31, 1992, a policy on the commercial use of its
surplus land satisfactory to IDA; (j) TRC shall carry out with Government and IDA
a mid-term review of project implementation by December 31, 1993. The following
were agreed as conditions of Credit Effectiveness: (a) execution of the subsidiary
Loan Agreement; (b) TRC's tariffs have been increased by a cumulative BOZ2 (c) TRC
has prepared and is making satisfactory progress in the implementation of action
plans to improve maintenance and train operations; (d) Government has appointed a
new Board of Directors for TRC; and (e) TRC has executed contracts for the leasing
of the hotels and the assets of the roads services and the franchising of the
catering services.
9.    Justification anl Risks:  The project, by addressing the underlying reasons
for TRC's poor operating and financial performance will enable it to subsequently
increase the utilization of its capacity, lower its unit cost, earn a good return
on its assets and be well-placed to be financially self-sustaining and pay
dividends on Government's substantial equity interest in it. The economy would
benefit directly through lower transport costs for long distance movements and the
potential for greater generation of foreign currency through TRC's increased
capacity to handle transit traffic reliably and efficiently. The major risk is
that TRC's management, after a decade of total lack of accountability for effective
use of its assets, may not be able to achieve the improvements in managerial
efficiency envisaged under the project thereby reducing the volume of traffic that
it can carry. The program of management strengthening envisaged under the project
would go some way towards mitigating this risk.   However, the only durable
insurance against this risk would be Government's commitment to hold TRC management
accountable for the monitorable performance objectives of the strategy and to take
effective remedial actions if these are not met.
10.   Recoumendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit complies with the
Articles of Agreement of the International Development Association and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve it.
