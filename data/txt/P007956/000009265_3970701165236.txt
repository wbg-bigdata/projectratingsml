WORLD BANK COMMENTS
PERU - CENTROMIN EXPANSION PROJECT
(LOAN 1281-PE)
PREFACE
The Bank approved a Loan of US$40 million equivalent in June 1976
to EMPRESA MINERA DEL CENTRO DEL PERU (CENTROMIN) to assist in financing
the Cobriza Mine Expansion and the Cerro de Pasco Mine Water Treatment
Plant.
The Project constituted an important part of CENTROMIN's Stage I
Program to expand copper production, to reduce pollution effects on the
environment and to provide necessary industrial and social infrastructure
to support the Project. Planning for the Project began under the company's
previous ownership, the Cerro de Pasco Corporation. Initial feasibility
studies were completed in 1975 for Cobriza and in 1974 for the Cerro de
Pasco Plant. Project implementation was suspended from the end of 1977 to
May 1979 due to shortage of Government funds. After reactivation,
substantial project modifications were required. Consequently, the
start-up of operations of Cobriza took place in November 1982, that of
Cerro de Pasco in February 1981, i.e., about three years later than
originally expected during the Bank Appraisal.
IND Staff visited Peru in August 1983 to discuss the draft
Project Completion Reports (PCRs) for the two subprojects prepared by
CENTROMIN. The Borrower's final PCRs were received on November 14, 1983 and
subsequently translated from Spanish. IND's comments on their PCRs were
submLtted on May 17, 1984. The project has not been audited by OED.
Further comments, dated June 10, 1985, received from the
Borrower, which are included as an Attachment, have been taken into account
in the revised text.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PERU - CENTROMIN EXPANSION PROJECT
WORLD BANK COMMENTS
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The IBRD Loan 1281-PE in the amount of US$40.0 million equivalent
was approved in June 1976 to assist EMPRESA MINERA DEL CENTRO DEL PERU
(CENTROMIN) to implement two sub-projects of its Stage I Expansion
Project. The Cobriza Mine Expansion was designed to increase underground
mine production to 10,000 tons of ore per day and to convert this ore to a
concentrate product. Plans for the Mine Water Treatment Plant at Cerro de
Pasco called for the construction of a solvent extraction and electro-
winning plant to both replace the less efficient existing facility and to
halt the contamination of the San Juan and Mantaro rivers. The project was
also to provide the associated industrial and social infrastructure (see para 1).
2.        Due to shortage of Government funds, which accounted for 57X of
the total project financing plan, implementation of both sub-projects
slowed down in late 1977 and was suspended from January 1978 until May
1979. After reactivation of the projects, a host of serious management and
operational problems developed between CENTROMIN and its expatriate project
management group. These problems are described in detail in CENTROMIN's
Project Completion Reports (see Annexes I and II).
3.        While CENTROMIN has prepared in general good Project Completion
Reports for the Cobriza Mine Expansion Project and for the Cerro de Pasco
Mine Water Treatment Plant, a number of clarifications and comments are
warranted on the part of the Bank. These include the critical area of the
Cobriza ore reserves which during project implementation required
substantial modifications to the original mine and concentrator plans (paras.7-9).
4.        Due to the loss of virtually two years during project suspension,
substantial engineering modifications required on the basis of unexpected
exploration results and the problems the company experienced with its
project management group, original project cost estimates were exceeded
considerably. Total project costs are estimated at about US$260.3 million,
i.e., a cost overrun of about 48X over the appraisal estimate.
Consequently, both the financial and the economic rates of return of the
project based on the range of World Bank copper price projections are
negative. Nevertheless, analysis indicates that keeping Cobriza
operational is justified on financial and economic grounds (see paras.
22-29).

PERU
CENTROMIN EXPANSION PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I.   INTRODUCTION
1.        The IBRD Loan 1281-PE provided financing for two project
components, i.e., the Cobriza Mine Expansion and the construction of the
Cerro de Pasco Mine Water Treatment Plant of Empresa Minera del Centro del
Peru (CENTROMIN). Both projects constituted an important part of
CENTROMIN's Stage I Program to expand production and processing and to
reduce environmental pollution. Specifically, the Cobriza project was
designed to (i) increase underground mine production from 2,600 tons to
10,000 tons of ore per day and (ii) to treat this ore in a new concentrator
with an annual output of 223,000 tons containing 252 copper and 5.5 oz. of
silver per ton. In addition, industrial and social infrastructure was to
be built to support the project. The main objective of the Mine Water
Treatment Plant at Cerro de Pasco was to replace the existing cementation
plant with a more efficient solvent extraction and electrowinning plant of
the same capacity, which would produce refined copper in place of cement
copper and halt the contamination of the San Juan and Mantaro rivers.
2.        At full capacity both project components will represent about 64%
of the company's total contained copper output compared to only 34% before
the expansion, and therefore comprise an important share of the company's
production and revenues. With total project costs estimated at about
US$260.3 million, of which US$39.7 came from the Bank and US$66.4 million
from the IDB, and revenues estimated to reach about 10% of CENTROMIN's
gross sales, b,th projects also play an important role in the company's
future.
II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Project History
3.        Plans for the modernization and expansion of CENTROMIN's
operations were originally formulated by the Cerro de Pasco Corporation,
owner of the company before nationalization on January 1, 1974. With the
formation of its own planning department in May 1974, CENTROMIN began to
modify and finalize a program to increase production of all major products
(copper, silver, zinc, lead, gold and bismuth), improve productivity and to
reduce environmental contamination. The company identified six projects as
Stage I of a long-term expansion program: Expansion of the Cobriza and
Casapalca mines, the modernization and expansion of the copper
smelter/refinery, construction of a zinc refinery and a lead sinter plant
at La Oroya, and the replacement of the copper cementation plant at Cerro
de Pasco with a solvent extraction and electrovinning plant. Feasibility
studies were prepared for all six projects.



-2-
4.        CENTROMIN requested the Bank to review the program and to assist
in it  4inancing.  Because of their high priority to the country, their
advanced state of preparation and their self-contained nature, the Bank
selected the Cobriza Mine Expansion and the Cerro de Pasco Mine Water
Treatment Plant for financingl/. For the Cobriza project a feasibility
study had been prepared in 1975 by the U.S. consultant firm Ralph Parsons.
In 1974 a feasibility study for the Cerro de Pasco project was carried out
by the U.S. engineering firm Holmes and Narver, Inc. The Bank appraised
the projects in April/May 1975 and August 1975. The Bank loan (1281-PE)
for US$40 million equivalent was signed on December 6, 1976 and became
effective May 24, 1977. Basic engineering studies for Cobriza began on
March 11, 1977, those of the Cerro de Pasco project on May 26, 1977.
Role of the Bank during Implementation
5.        The Bank worked closely with CENTROMIN on the formulation of both
projects. As a result of this work the scope of the Cobriza expansion
project was increased from 7,000 tons of ore per day to 10,000 tons per day
to realize optimal economy of scale and new investment capital cost
estimates were prepared. Due to shortage of Government funds which were
supposed to provide 57% of total project financing, implementation of the
projects slowed down in late 1977 and was suspended from January 1978 until
May 1979.  Overall, virtually two years were lost.  However, exploration
work continued during this period showing that there were no economically
viable reserves in the Pumagayoc area, from which ore was supposed to be
mined for Cobriza's expansion. Thus, the basic engineering for the mining
aspects of the project performed up to this point was no longer valid.
After the reactivat ion of the engineering contracts a host of serious
management and operational problems developed between CENTROMIN's internal
project administration and the expatriate project management group. The
Bank attempted during its supervision missions and in special meetings to
identify solutions to those problems aimed at reducing further delays and
cost overruns. Nevertheless, some of the problems remained and could not
be reso'ved. The most significant of these problems concerned the lack of
coordination between CENTROMIN's project administration and the project
managei'ent group and detrimentally affected mine desigr., the construction
of the mine shaft and project scheduling. How CENTROMIN saw these problems
is described in their Project Completion Reports (see Annexes I and II).
III. BANK STAFF CLARIFICATION REGARDING CENTROMIN'S PROJECT COMPLETION
REPORTS
6.        In general, CENTROMIN has prepared good Project Completion
Reports for the Cobriza Mine Expansion Project and for the Cerro de Pasco
Mine Water Treatment Plant covering almost all aspects required under the
Bank's guidelines. However, a number of clarifications and comments are
warranted on the part of the Bank concerning (i) the ore reserve question
of Cobriza; (ii) the possibility of increasing Cobriza's mine output; (iii)
the relationship between CENTROMIN and its project management consultants;
(iv) CENTROMIN's capital cost estimates; and (v) technical, financial and
environmental issues relating to the Mine Water Treatment Plant as follows.
1/ The other projects in the stage I program have also been completed with
the major exception of the copper circuit for the La Oroya refinery.

Cobriza Ore Reserves
7.        At the time of the Bank appraisal, ore reserves which were mined
for the old Cobriza plant in the Coris area were estimated to total about
50 million tons with an average grade of 1.82 Cu and 5 oz. silver per ton
of ore. At the proposed mining rate this ore deposit would have been
sufficient for 14 years of operation. In addition, the ore deposit was
believed to extend across to the Pumagayoc area where scout drilling and
geological interpretation indicated another 60 million tons of possible ore
of similar grade. Therefore, overall reserves were considered reasonably
assured for the proposed expansion with over 20 years of mill-feed ore
available.
8.        Additional geological exploration, however, has not only been
unable to confirm the earlier estimates but also found the mineralization
at Pumagayoc to be economically unattractive owing to its very small size,
lower grade and costly development requirements. In addition, the ore
grade in the Coris area had to be revised downward to an average grade of
about 1.3Z Cu or about 72% of the grade estimated during the Bank
appraisal. The higher ore grades and larger reserves originally estimated
resulted from the erroneous assumption that the deposits were of stratiform
nature, i.e., extending consistently to the West, increasing in depth, and
reaching across the Pumagayoc ridge. This misjudgment was made by all
parties involved in project preparation on the basis of insufficient
physical evidence through adequate drilling necessary to at least intercept
the assumed mineralized extensions. Drilling exploration to this effect
should have been completed prior to the actual project implementation or by
the latest at the time work on Cobriza was reactivated in late 1979.
However, both CENTROMIN and Project Management personnel remained
optimistic and little concerned about detailed reserve identification since
project implementation itself required their fullest attention. As we now
know, this proved to be an essential error. The lower ore grade has
required considerable modifications of the processing circuits and
increased reagent consumption, and thereby critically affects the financial
viability of Cobriza due to the fact that processing facilities were sized,
designed and constructed for ores with significantly higher copper content.
9.        CENTROMIN has recently accelerated its efforts to discover other
higher grade ore deposits in the area, but it appears doubtful whether this
will improve the project's finances in the short to medium term because of
both the usual risks associated with such exploration and the additional
investment and time required to study, develop, and start mining a new
large mineral deposit. Nevertheless, existing general geological trends
indicate that over the longer term it appears likely that additional
reserves similiar to the ore presently mined could be delineated through
CENTROMIN's ongoing exploration efforts. These efforts are given highest
priority by the com3any since they are needed to ensure the long-term
future of Cobriza. _/
2/ As of June 1985, CENTROMIN estimated that sufficient proven and
probable ore reserves remain for a minimum of ten year production with
significant potential of an additional five years.

Increase in Production Capacity
10.       A more immediate solution to improving the economics of the
Cobriza project may be found in raising the utilization of installed
facilities at a higher than the planned rate.  The existence of some
over-capacity of several major processing components due to over-design,
such as two extra mills, suggests that a production increase of about 20X
to 12,000 tons of ore per day could be achieved with relatively minor
investment needed to remove some bottlenecks, such as expansion of the
crusher discharge system, and addition of pumps and flotation cells.
CENTROMIN is presently studying this solution for possible implementation
as soon as project start-up difficulties have been fully resolved.3/
II.       At the time of the appraisal, CENTROMIN decided to expand its
concentrating capacity at Cobriza by erecting a new plant and dismantling
the existing concentrator which had been inaugurated only nine years
before. The old plant was located on the side of the mountain and exposed
to potential hazards from unstable slopes and local talus slides. For this
reason it was decided to shut down the old plant. Unfortunately, the new
much costlier plant was established also on the side of a mountain which
may be subject to the risk of similar slides although the slopes are
somewhat less steep and its base broader. In retrospect, it appears that
more consideration should have been given to the tectonic conditions of the
new plant location. This knowledge together with the uncertainty of the
reserves may have resulted in a more modest expansion based on their
existing plant facilities and infrastructure.
Consultants for Cobriza
12.       Although CENTROMIN had voiced concern during the Bank appraisal
as to the Bank's requirement of retaining an expatriate project management
firm to assist CENTROMIN in the implementation of the project, the company
agreed to it before Board presentation. Nevertheless, the actual selection
and participation of the expatriate project manager for the overall
execution of the Cobriza project became a highly controversial subject.
CENTROMIN felt that it could better implement the project by itself, and
was not keen on contracting management services for this purpose. However,
the Bank held that CENTROMIN's staff did not have sufficient project
experience. The relationship between CENTROMIN's project administration
and the Project Manager became increasingly difficult and deteriorated to
the point where the parties did not talk to each other anymore.
13.       There is little doubt that the project did suffer from this
situation. And in fact some main project components clearly show major
design and operational difficulties resulting from inadequate engineering
and poor construction. 4/ Designwise, this situation is typically
reflected by the apparently larger than needed milling section of the
3/ After further investigations, the borrower informed the Bank (see
Borrower's Comments in the Attachment) that this alternative is
presently difficult to implement because depressed copper prices and
limited ore reserves could hardly justify the required expansion
expenditures.

concentrator. Operationally, the tailings thickener, for example, had to
be abandoned due to leakage from major cracks resulting from settlement
attributed to poor compaction. In addition, the mining component of the
project had to be executed by CENTROMIN itself, since according to the
company several activities under the responsibility of the Project Manager,
such as mine plans, technical input and support for shaft sinking, were not
satisfactory.  CENTROMIN completed this work on its own although about 15
months after project inauguration in May 1982. This delay reduced the
average mine capacity by about 40% during this period. In light of these
problems, the question can be raised as to whether the Bank should have
more positively considered CENTROMIN's request in April 1977 to retain a
watch-dog- firm to monitor the performance of the Project Manager.
Capital Cost Adjustments of Cobriza Project
14.       When the projects were reactivated in May 1979, the Project
Managers substantially modified the earlier basic engineering, especially
with respect to mine development, mine equipment, an additional mine shaft,
hydraulic fill, a transmission line and a new ore transportation system,
estimating capital costs in the order of US$260 million for Cobriza and
US$15.0 million for Cerro de Pasco. CENTROMIN decided, however, to keep
total actual capital costs for the Cobriza Mine Expansion Project below
US$240 million. This was achieved primarily by allocating only a minor
portion of the required working capital to the project.
15.       Since working capital was not directly assigned to the project,
no exact information is available but on the basis of increases in
concentrate and supplies inventories and in accounts receivable,
incremental working capital neads for Cobriza have been estimated at abo"t
US$14 million. 5/ Peruvian accounting procedures require that interest
during construction be capitalized up to the time when the project has
operated for three full months at a minimum of 80% of rated plant
capacity. CENTROMIN anticipated that Cobriza would have met this test by
the end of 1983. Thus an additional US$7.7 million would be chargeable to
the project. These adjustments are shown in the following table:

5/ Although Cobriza concentrates will replace to a certain extent
purchased concentrates to be used in the La Oroya smelter, the net
working capital requirement of Cobriza is believed to be considerably
higher due to longer throughput and higher mining and processing costs.

Mine Water Treatment Plant
16.       At the time of the appraisal, the main objectives of the project
were to replace the existing cementation process with a solvent extraction
and electrowinning plant that would neutralize discharges and effectively
eliminate impurities. With the same production capacity but at lower costs
the plant was supposed to recover copper in refined form with a high grade
of 99.9% Cu instead of the -cement product containing only 60-70% Cu. The
new operation would eliminate the flow of polluting discharges into the San
Juan and Mantaro rivers.  These discharges, which took place over many
years have been characterized as acidic, turbid and containing iron and
other impurities. In addition, the old cementation process required scrap
iron which was expected to become increasingly scarce in Peru. This
assumption did, however, not materialize.
17.       In terms of the project's pollution control objective, after
detailed study the neutralization component of this project was eliminated
with Bank approval in order to avoid cost overruns and was replaced by
discharging the effluents to a tailings pond instead of the San Juan and
Mantaro rivers. The full environmental impact of this short-term solution
chiefly depends on the balance of discharges to the pond and actual
evaporation rates. This is presently under study. To this end, CENTRONIN
has requested that the Bank send an envirormental specialist for a detailed
review of possible options for the long-term disposal of both all effluents
from the Cerro de Pasco mine waters and the proposed tailings disposal from
the Cobriza concentrator. A Bank mission will be scheduled shortly.
18.       The mine water treatment plant without the neutralization
component was constructed within the original budget estimate of US$15.3
million. Data is not available as to the savings CENTROMIN realized on
account of the scope change. Full production has not yet been reached.
Output during 1983 is estimated at about 5,200 tons of contained copper
representing about 86% of installed capacity. Full capacity output is
expected to be reached some time in 1984. 6/ The relatively long start-up
period, since June 1981, resulted primaril7y from major electrical
difficulties with transformers and rectifiers which halted plant operations
over a period of five months while they were replaced. 7/ Contrary to the
SAR assumption, the new plant did not succeed in lowering operating costs,
but is expected to require approximately US$1.0 million more per year in
real terms in production costs compared to the old plant owing to higher
electricity costs and larger use of costlier reagents. However, the
present plant produces refined copper which does not require further
processing.
IV. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
19.       Since the financial section of CENTROMIN's PCR is limited to
assumptions as to copper and silver prices and five-year projections of

2% reduction of copper production per year is expected.

21.       The table shows that the actual price development of copper
remained consistently well below the forecasts used in the SAR. For the
six year period, 1977-1982, the copper price in current terms averaged 76
cents/lb. while the SAR had assumed an average of US$1.15/lb., i.e., a 50%
higher price level.   CENTROMIN's price projections for the next five years
exceed those by the Bank by an average of 31%. In contrast, CENTROMIN's
silver price projections appear reasonable over the longer term. As
proceeds from silver will amount to only about 6% of Cobriza's gross sales
value, minor price variations of that metal are not very critical to the
overall picture.



-8-
Financial Rate of Return
22.       The SAR estimated the incremental before-tax returns in real
terms for the Cobriza project at 15.2% and for the Cerro de Pasco Mine
Water Treatment Plant at 18.1%. On the basis of the project capital costs
estimated as of September 1983 and estimates for (i) future operating costs
as predicted by CENTROMIN and (ii) net revenues based on the range of World
Bank copper price projections, new cost and benefit streams have been
prepared for both projects.
23.       On the basis of the range of the Bank's price projections the
recalculation of the Cobriza project yields an incremental rate of return
before income taxes of between -10.5% and -8.5%, i.e., the anticipated
benefits over the life of the mine and the plant are insufficient to
recapture the initial capital costs, future asset replacement plus actual
and future operating costs of the project. This very significant reduction
in the financial outlook of the project stems primarily from the
substantial capital cost overrun (about 62% over SAR estimate) and the
considerably lower than expected copper price combined with markedly lower
than expected copper grade (1.3% versus 1.8% assumed in the SAR resulting
in only 170,000 tons of concentrate rather than the originally expected
223,000 tons).
24.       In order to offset the actual, lower ore grade and improve the
financial performance of the Cobrixa project, CENTROMIN contemplates the
possibility of increasing ore produ,Lion by 20% to 12,000 tons per day (see
paras. 11 and 12). Assuming that the exploration program, which is
currently underway, will prove sufficient reserves within a long-term time
frame, the increased production would generate about US$5.5 million in
additional net revenues per year and improve the incremental financial rate
of return to +1.2%.
25.       In view of these rate of returns, the question becomes relevant
as to whether CENTROMIN would not be better off financially to close down
COBRIZA.  To assess this option, the net cash flow after debt servicing of
keeping COBRIZA operational have to be compared with the option of
abandoning the operation. All historic capital costs are considered sunk
for this purpose but interest and principal repayments of all relevant
loans would be maintained as scheduled. The estimated effects on the rest
of CENTROMIN's operation is considered to be negligible since it is assumed
that it can expand its contract smelt'ng business to the extent of
COBRIZA's production. It is very difficult to estimate the cost of
shutting the plant and to determine the exact write-off benefits.
Nevertheless, our analysis indicates that keeping the operation going would
over the period 1983-92 result in a rate of return of about 16%.
26.       A similar conclusion can be reached using a different
methodological approach as follows. Despite closing down Cobriza, loan
servicing would have to be continued. On a per pound of produced copper
basis this amounts to 39t in 1983 terms. Since total cash costs for one
pound of copper amounts to 115t (para. 28), a copper price of 76e/lb. in



-9-
1983 terms would equal the options of abandoning versus continued
operation. This price is very close to the Bank's price projections.
27.       While scope changes of the Cerro de Pasco Mine Water Treatment
Plant allowed it to be completed at the original cost estimate (para. 18),
the copper output of the plant is expected to be roughly the same as could
have been expected if the old cement plant would have been retained.
Deviating from CENTROHIN's PCR, for our analysis it was assumed that only
sufficient copper bearing solution for the annual production of 5,200 tons
of copper would be available compared to CENTROMIN's estimate of 6,000
tpa. Contrary to the SAR assumption, the new plant did not succeed in
lowering operating costs but is expected to require in 1983 terms
approximately US$1.0 million more per year primarily resulting from higher
electricity and reagent demand. Consequently, in addition to the total
capital costs of US$15.3 million, higher operating costs and equal
revenues, the new plant cannot be expected to generate a positive
incremental cash flow in any of the 22 years of construction (7) and
operation (15).
Cobriza Production Costs
28.       On a per pound basis direct operating costs for mining and
concentration8/ at full production (10,000 tpd) are estimated in 1983
terms to amount to 46t/lb.  Depreciation expenses add about 194/lb. and
financial charges an average of about 21¢/lb. Assuming headquarter
overhead expenses applicable to Cobriza at about lOt/lb., the total
production cost of one pound contained copper ex La Oroya amount to
approximately US$0.96/lb. Taking account of sales commission,
transportation, insurance, freight, smelting charges, export taxes, etc.,
and of a by-product credit of 8¢/lb. a LME price of about US$1.16/lb. is
necessary to break-even. On a cash basis (including principal repayment),
the break-even price amounts to approximately US$1.15/lb.
29.       Despite this dismal picture, the new, large-scale Cobriza project
has been successful in reducing direct operating costs by 40% compared to
the old installation. Thus, per short ton of ore mined, direct operating
costs of the new facilities presently amount to US$9.64 (US$6.35 for mining
and US$3.29 for concentration) in contrast to the US$16.30 (US$10.27 for
mining and US$6.03 for concentration) of the old installation. On the
basis of direct operating costs only, Cobriza ranks as the least cost
producer of CENTROMIN's six mining centers.
Cobriza - Projected Income and Cash Generation
30.       Cobriza is projected on the basis of the Bank's copper price
assumptions to incur an accumulated loss for tne period 1983-88 of about
US$20.4 million in current terms. During the same period Cobriza will have
a cash deficit of USS40.1 million. Details are given in Table III. It
8/ Include direct mining costs and direct concentration costs but exclude
refining costs, other charges (e.g., transportation, insurance,
marketing, handling) and overhead expenses.



-10-
should be noted that these projections do not include the cost for
additional financing required to cover the cash shortfalls. In addition,
CENTROMIN does not include headquarter overhead expenses attributable to
Cobriza in the operating expenses.  Consequently, only direct mining and
concentrating costs are covered.
31.       The projections indicate that over the next few years Cobriza
will unfortunately not be in a position to alleviate CENTROMIN's already
strained financial position but rather will further burden the company's
situation. Only from 1989 on, will Cobriza produce overall positive net
income and net cash surpluses. By then, copper prices are predicted to
generate net revenues in excess of operating and capital expenses. The new
Cerro de Pasco operation is too small to have any significant influence on
CENTROMIN's total financial picture.

period 1979-82 are presented in Table IV. The accounts reflect the
company's deterioration of its financial position in 1981 and 1982, which
was mainly due to the depressed international metal markets, a sharp
increase in borrowings to finance the company's heavy investment program
and cash deficits and large foreign exchange losses resulting from sol

Financial Covenants
33.       As a consequence of the worsening of CENTROMIN's financial
position from 1980 on, the company was unable to meet the financial
covenants relating to the financial ratios stipulated in the Loan Agreement
(Sections 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6 of Loan 1281-PE). On December 1, 1982,
CENTROMIN requested a waiver of these clauses for 1981 and 1982. However,
in its latest long-term projections covering the period 1984-1987,
CENTROMIN shows that it cannot meet the current ratio covenant (1.5 to 1)
before the year 1986 and the debt/equity ratio (50:50) during any of the
projected years. If the accounts are expressed in US dollars, in which
CENTROMIN's products are primarily traded, the financial ratios would
improve markably. 9/ A summary of CENTROMIN's financial projections is

Economic Reevaluation
34.       On the basis of the Bank's metal price projections the net
foreign exchange surplus generated by Cobriza and Cerro de Pasco is
estimated to gradually build .p to about US$45 million in 1982 real terms.
No income tax and no dividends for the projects would accrue to the
Peruvian Government before 1990. Fiscal revenues will result nevertheless
from increased export and sales taxes, import duties and indirect benefits.
35.       The necessary adjustments to the financial benefits are not
sufficient to make the incremental economic rate of return for the projects
positive. The employment benefits from the projects are described in
detail in CENTROMIN's PCR.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
36.       After an over three year delay caused primarily by the economic
crisis in Peru beginning in 1977, both projects, the Cobriza Mine Expansion
and the Agua de Mina plant in Cerro de Pasco, are now physically complete
and in operation. Primarily due to the unresolved ore reserve question in
Cobriza and the less than expected volume of copper bearing mine water to
be treated in Cerro de Pasco, it is still very doubtful whether the
projects will achieve their full technical objectives over the originally
expected project period. Because of the very high cost overruns of the
Cobriza mine expansion10/ together with the lower than antiripated ore
grade, the project's economic objectives cannot be achieved unless
production is increased substantially, a much more attractive mineralized
area is found in the near future, and/or the Bank assumptions as to future
metal price development turn out to be too conservative, i.e. copper and/or
silver prices show a drastic upward swing.
37.       The degree of uncertainty affecting the future of the projects is
further heightened by the fact that Cobriza is located within an area of
political instability. So far only limited terrorist activity occurred
with an outlying communication station having been destroyed.
38.       Timely and proper project implementation and avoidance of
significant cost overruns can normally be controlled by the project
implementing agency and its overseeing bodies. With respect to Cobriza,
the country's economic crisis in the late Seventies played a dominant
factor in the almost two year project suspension. Furthermore, the success
of all mining projects is greatly dependent on the exogeneous factor of
world market prices for their products. Thus, the accurate estimation of
future metal prices for a mining project can reduce or altogether eliminate
the financial and economic success of a project as to the same or even
higher extent as capital cost overruns or delays in project completion.
When applying the original SAR copper price projections (see Table II) to
the actual capital expenditures and the latest projected sales and
operating cost estimates over the life of the Cobriza project, the
incremental rate of return increases from negative 8.5-10.5 (see para. 23)
to positive 5.4%. Thus, the price forecasting error between the appraisal
and the current assumptions amounts to about 15 percentage points in the
financial rate of return of the project.
39.       At the time work resumed on the projects in May 1979, the Bank
reviewed CENTROMIN's revised implementation schedule and capital cost
estimates.   Although no formal reappraisal of the projects took place at
that time, tbe economic rate of return was reestimated for Cobriza at close
to 20% using the then latest Bank projections for copper prices. Moreover,
CENTROMIN advised the Bank on February 26, 1979 that although its
10/ The borrower points out (see Borrower's Comments in the Attachment)
that the final costs of the project should not be compared with the
appraisal estimate but rather with the estimate arrived at as result of
the revised basic engineering. On this basis, Cobriza was completed
considerably under budget.



-14-
exploration work in the Pumagayoc area could not prove out the expected
reserves, the size of the proven and potential ore reserves in th'- Coris
area would guarantee ample ore supply for the project. CENTROMIN's Project
Management endorsed the company's contention and also concluded that the
change in the area of the ore reserve did not justify a change in project
scope nor an increase in 'he overall project costs.  The average  ,rade
estimate at that time was given at 1.77% copper and 0.5 ozs. silver per ton
of ore, almost exactly what the SAR had indicated. The downward revision
of the copper grade took place much later. Consequently, on the basis of
the then available information it was not warranted that the project be
stopped and the incurred expenditures of US$13.8 million be written off.
40.       Similarly, it could now be argued that it would be more
beneficial to shut down Cobriza rather than continuing its operation while
incurring large financial losses. CENTROMIN's management points out,
however, that Cobriza is its lowest direct cost mining center and that it
would have to serve its debts in any case. With 81.3% of total project
costs borrowed from external sources, continued operation enables the
company to generate at least the foreign exchange portion of the projected
US$124 million debt service over the next five years. If Cobriza were to
close today, its technical impact on the remaining CENTROMIN operation
could be reduced by increasing its custom smelting operation. As in the
past, the La Oroya smelter would then be available for an increased share
of custom concentrates produced by Peru's large number of small and medium-
sized mines. These concentrates are presently shipped primarily to Japan.
Consequently, in addition to its financial implications for the company the
closing of Cobriza would primarily eliminate most of the 650 direct jobs at
the mine and impact adversely on the transport and general services sectors
of the region.
41.       CENTROMIN discusses in its PCR's the shortfalls of the projects
and provides suggestions as to improvements in several areas. They need
not be repeated here. There are a number of conclusions, however, which
can be drawn by the Bank for consideration in future projects in the mining
sector. In fact, most of these conclusions have been incorporated to a
various degree in the selection/appraisal and supervision process of the
Miuing Division.
42.       The main lesson to be learned affecting project identification
and appraisal is that feasibility studies have to be reviewed and assessed
in depth with a more critical eye as to whether the goals of the project
have been set realistically on the basis of the underlying assumptions.
Specifically, in mining projects this would require a high level of
scrutiny of (i) the presented ore reserve data and its respective
geological interpretation; (ii) the sizing of the proposed projects in
light of given ore reserves and technical, financial or other constraints;
and (iii) the actual detail design proposals in order to avoid unwanted
over-design or under-design of the various project components.

1.  MDENTIFICATION OF TIE PRtJECr, FEASIBILTTY AND PREFEASIBILIIY STUDIES
LtteuS ra)j *.--TcT-an:7W -)
At the end of 1974, the Cobriza mine produced 1833 tons of grade 2.2%
copper ore, and plans were laid at that time to expand the output to 7,&0k tons
of grade 1.6% copper on the assumption that reducing the grade of the ore to be
extracted would make the mining operation more efficient and less selective than
at present.
The ore produced would be treated in the existing concentrator plant (2,0a0
TPD) and in a new plant with an initial capacity of 5,000 TPD to be built in the
Coris valley some 3 kmu from the present plant. The new concentrator would be
constructed in modules of 2,50O TPD each so that it could easily be expanded to
7,500 or 10,000 TPD. The possibility of eventually closing the existing plant
and centralizing concentration operations in Coris was considered. However,
there was no discussion at that time about working the Cerro Pumagayoc or Level
10 of the Cerro de Coris (Cobriza Mine), alternatives that have been discussed
only since 1975 and 1978, respectively, after the findings from studies on those
operations '4ere in.
The expansion project included a tailings dump in the Coris valley (to
serve both plants) and the construction of the housing and services required.
The electric power needed would be obtained from the Mantaro Hydroelectric Power
Plant.
The investment required was estimated at that time to be about
US$42 million, to be disbursed between 1975 and 1978, when the expansion would
be placed in operation.
The feasibility study made by consultants at the beginning of 1975 defined
the following parameters:
-    Operation at an average of 7,000 TPD.
-    Construction of the new 7,000 TPD concentrator in la Pampa de Corts,
using sone of the equiptent and materials from the existing
concentrator.
-    Construction of an access tunnel to the Pampa de Coris, crossing the
Cerro Pumagayoc, which would help to evaluate the potential reserves
in the area.
-    Alluvial material taken from the slopes of the adjacent area would
continue to be used for mine fill, leaving for later the analysis of
the a'lternative of using part of the tailings as hydraulic filL
-    Irstallation of a tailings thickener to recover industrial water in
the annual periods of fresh water shortage.
-    The tailinqs would be dumped directly in Mantaro, with plans for later
timiting that activity by setting up a tailings dump in tile area of
Banos de Coris.



-17-
The auxiliary services, management, housing and welfare facilities
would remain at their present location, and would be expanded as
needed.
-    The project would begin in mid-1975 and would end in mid-1978. The
amount of investment required would be USS67.6 million, and the
internal rate of return on the investment, considering the costs and
income differentials over the existing operation, would be about 5.6%,
including tax deductions.
Later, negotiations began with the World Bank and the Inter-American Bank
to finance the project, and in order to improve its profitability, it was
expanded to lk,woo TPD, based on the potential reserves of the deposit located
both in cerro Coris and in Cerro Pumagayoc. With the aid of World Bank
specialists, a new investment estimate was prepared, which increased it to
US$160.9 million, including preoperation financing charges and a substantial
escalation and contingencies reserve.
The Bank's aid made it possible for the loan contract to be signed on
December 6, 1976, that is, the negotiations lasted only a little over a year,
and the basic engineering studies began imzuediately since the management
contract for the project was signed on March 11, 1 7.
II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANaGEMENT
a). Scop of the Project
(1) Based on the need for selective mining if the 2,600 TPD rate
was continued, the proven-probable reserves, the great
potential of the mine, and the economic feasibility of the
expansion, Centromin decided to expand the mine, concentrator
and auxiliary facilities in order to operate it at the optimal
level of production, which at the time of the evaluations was
found to be 10,000 TPD. That expansion would make it possible
both to make better use of the Cobriza mining resources without
lowering costs and to produce concentrates at a rate consistent
with the mine's reserves and potenti.z10
To that end, a consulting firm was hired to conduct
the feasibility study for the project. The study
findings led to the adoption of the most appropriate
alternative for implementing the project, which primarily
consisted of:
Mine Development and Preparation: Improve the mine system by
constructing galleries, cross cuts, sublevels, chimneys, and
ramps at the various levels of opreration to expedite ore
extraction and hauling.
To that end, the project called for the purchase of large
capacity LHD mining equipment such as Scooptrams, hydraulic
drllls, low profile trucks, raise borers, etc.



-18-
The proposed mining system is a modification of the current
system, with the major change being the almost vertical boring
system, which will take it possible to have the entire length
of the stope bored, imaprove the cycles within the stope and
eliminate lost tirte owing to transfer of equipment. The ore
extracted fro. the mine will be hauled to the concentrator
plant by electric locomotives or waine cars.
Ore will be transported from the levels below level 28 through
level 10 and from there will be hoisted to the nain extraction
level (level 10) by a 220 m shaft.
Concentrator Plant: The ore processing plant consists of: a
primary stone crushing plant, a 5,X00 tons storage area for
coarse stone, a fine crushed stone plant and closed circuit
classification, and a 5,g00 tons capacity storage area for
fines; The grinding plant, consisting of two grinding circuits
(primary and secondary), the flotation plant with
conventional rougher scavenger and cleaning circuits. A two
line giratory circuit, with thickener and filtering sections,
Is included.
The concentrator plant will have a capacity of 10,000 tons/pd.
Urban Area: The project has built an urban complex of 450
multifanmily buildings. The complex includes such community
facilities as a civic center, schools, medical posts, shopping
center and recreational areas. It occupies about 11 ha located
adjacent to the concentrator plant in the esplanade of Pawupa de
Coris.
- Mantaro-Cobriza Transmission Line: The present thermal energy
plant in Cobriza has been replaced by the Mantaro Hydroelectric
Plant of Electro Peru. The power will be transmitted by a 69
K' high-voltage line approxirately 55 km long.
- Auxiliary Services: The project has installed auxiliary
services like: water supply, warehouses, repair and
maintenance shops, internal comlaunications system, electrical
substations and the transmission line from Pampa de Coris to
the mine. It has also built a concentrate transfer station in
the town of Huayucachi 10 km from Huancayo.
(ii) After the project was suspended in January 1978, it was
reactivated in May 1979, at which time the location of the ore
extraction was changed. The project originally called for
extracting ore from Pumagayoc and Cobriza. The change meant
that ore would be extracted only from Cobriza, which at that
time was in production, although on a reduced scale. This
change resultea from the discovery of additional ore reserves
in the Cobriza area, while studies of the Punmagayoc area had
found lower grade ore. Reactivating the mine was mutually
agreed upon by the top level management of Centrorin Peru and
the project managers.



-19-
b) Project anagement
(i) To manage the project, Centromin Peru hired a foreign Soumpanv
associated with a national consulting firm. Under this
contract, the managers were responsible for implementing the
project plan, organize, direct, coordinate and control all
act vities involved in the mine expansion and in the
construction process, and install and operate auxiliary
facilities and the concentrator plant until reaching standard
operations.
For all project business, Centromin Peru is represented by the
project administration, working in coordination with the
managers and supervising all aspects of compliance with the
project management contract. In addition to representing the
owner, the administration was in charge of planning,
development and construction of the following areas: the urban
housing complex, the Mantaro-Cobriza high-voltage transmission
line, and the hydraulic fill plant, as well as mine planning.
(ii) During the project, the project administration worked closely
with the managers and third parties. Under the direction o3f
dhe managers, Centromin Peru hired specialized companies to
perform the detailed engineering, arranged for purchase of
equipa.ent and material through international calls for bids,,
and contracted for earth movement, and civil, electromechanical
and mine development works, all supervised by the managers. It
was also necessary to hire specialized firms to solve problems
that occurred during the project. Aid was also obtained from
technical representatives of the equipment suppliers. In
general, they all provided aid as required.
(iii) Management services were not satisfactory throughout the
project, because a number of problems occurred in various
stages of implementation. This was particularly true of basic
engineering and as a result detailed engineering, because
neither an adequate mine development plan nor a suitable
project control system were prepared. Consequently, the
technology employed was inappropriate for the characteristics
of the project, and this situation was made worse by
continually having to replace key personnel assigned to the
project.
Because of the terms of the contract with the managers, the CMP-
had to rely aluost entirely on their managerial ability and
their responsibility for the work perfor.iied, which prevented
the ChP fronm taking over sufficiently in advance the managers'
corntractual functions, which the financing agencies were
informed about in the coordination and evaluation meetings held
with IDa and ISWD officials. The pragmatic solution to these
problems would have been to rescind the contract, and hire an
outside consultant.
1/  CMP:  CentromIn Peru



-20-
(Iv) In its original conception, the project was reported to the
World Bank through a prefeasibility study drawn up by
a consulting firm, in cooperation with the CMP.
Based on the prefeasibility study and the contract with the
project managers, the US$40 million IBRD loan was extended for
projects to expand thse Cobriza mine and concentrator and the
mine water treatment plant. That amount was maintained during
implementation of both projects.
After reactivating the Cobriza project, the World Bank required
from the managers and the CmP periodic information on the
status of the project. This was provided in a monthly progress
report by the managers and a quarterly report by the CMP
Projects Execution Division, which reported to the l1RD and to
the IDB on the most important agreements, progress,
modifications or variations in the original plan and in the
financing structure, among others.
The CtP maintained close relationship with the managers,
consultants, technicians and contractors that took part in the
project, in order to achieve satisfactory solutions to the
problems of conceptual changes in the design, technical
specifications, programming system and progress control, the
control system for costs and commitments, the disbursement
schedule, and changes in the financial structure, which were
reported to the financial institutions at the proper time.
In light of the difficulties that occurred because of the
managers' unsatisfactory performance, which resulted in delays
and consequently higher implementation costs for the project,
in addition to nonperformance of the contract for the
development program anc preparation of the mine, which had to
be taken over by the CMP, it is of crucial importance for the
CMP to be informed, in order to evaluate the project, of the
results of the IBRD and IDB evaluation of the services provided
by the project managers.
C) Performance of the Consulting Foreign Firms
(i)  Through the managers, Centromin Peru hired several consulting
firms. The detailed design engineering for the production
shaft was performed by engineering consultants, whose work
was regarded as satisfactory by Cantromin Peru.
The detailed engineering throughout the project was performed
by local engineering consultants, under the direct
supervision of the managers. It was necessary to hire soil
specialists to prevent cave-in of the thickener wastes. In
general, the consultants. satisfactorily met Centromin Peru's
requirements.



-21-
In the construction stage, technical aid for Installation
and/or assembly of the main equipment was provided at plant
testiny and start-up by consulting firm experts, who gave
instruction and training to the operating staff
d)   Perforr-ance of the Suppliers
{i)  In general, the quality of service of most suppliers was above
the acceptable average. While some of them did not meet
delivery schedules, these delays were mainly due to
consultations by the managers. In other cases, delays were
caused by transportation strikes and tie-ups, and in a few
instances, they were the fault of the manufacturers, in which
case the penalties stipulated in the purchase orders were
The project administration assistants visited the suppliers and
found that manufacture and quality of the equipment purchased
was satisfactory. In addition, it was determined that most
firms maintain an adequate stock of repair parts.
In summary, the suppliers, with some exceptions, met our
requirements. Delays in equipment delivery did not in general
result in significant delays in the project execution program.
;ii) Problems or limitations in the suppliers' meeting our orders
were mostly due to administrative and organization problems, as
in the case of one supplier, where changes in the personnel
initially assigned to fill our purchase order caused technical
delays affected delivery times.
Another reason was that some suppliers offered a project for
working c,nditions different from our requirements.  This
situation could have been avoided by more effective and
intensive follow-up by the managers.
(ii3) Examples are the following: Some suppliers did not provide
antislipping controls and turbo-charger on the engines;
other suppliers provided wrong shaft tubing; locomotives
received were unsuitable for the installed unloading system;
spare parts were not provided by some firms and there were
defects in the pulley desigas of others.
(iv) Perfornance of the Contractors
In evaluating the contractors' proposals, it was noted that,
despite doubts about the capabilities and/or performance of the
low bid company, quantifying the comipany's perforr.mance compared
to other proposals was difficult and subjective. So some
companies that won the bid did not satisfactorily carry out
their contracts, and this delayed the implementation ot the
project.



-22-
e)   Loqistics
(1) Purchases had to comply with the lending institutions! bidding
rules on the purchase order amounts.
The managers handled purchases abroad, while purchases in Lima
were handled by Centromin Peru. The managers' responsibility
for local purchiases endea with delivery of the approved
requisition. The following logistics management stages were
handled by the CMP, except for the receipt of materials in the
field, and later disti-ibtion to the contractors, which was
handled efficiently at the warehouse.
Similarly, materials and equipment purchased abroad were
cleared through customs and hauled to the field under CMP
supervision. Here the uanagers merely coordinated the follow-
UP.S
(ii) The Bank's regulations only caused difficulties wben suppliers
that won the bid were from countries not eligible under the
lending institution's rules. In addition, the rigidity and
strictness of general purchase terms and conditions caused some
suppliers to refrain from making bids. moreover, the 15%
preference margin for local suppliers did not enable local
firms to win the bid, so most bids were won by foreign firms.
In general, the regulations followed made it possible for
purchases to be entirely flexible.
(iii) There were really no reasons for blaming suppliers for delays
during the project.
(iv) Although the company has undoubtedly standardized certain
equipment, international bids made it possible to expand our
list of suppliers and obtain the specified equipment and
materials of the proper quality, on time and at the lowest
price.
f)   Implementation of the Program
(i) Before and during construction of the works, Centromin Peru
imposed strict controls over the work programs in each area to
miniaize possible defects in implementation. (Table 1).
In the construction projects, bonuses and penalties were
stilulated to encourage better performance and progress of the
works.
(ii) Table A summarizes the project of the Cobriza Expansion Project
in May 1983.



-23-
(ili-jY)
The main reasons for progress and/or delay are as follows:
Progress:
Civil works and electromechanical assembly (EC-8 and EC-13):
The- mechanical works of the concentrator plant were completed
one and a half months early because of implementing the
accelerated construction program submitted in 198L
Delays:
Extraction shaft (EC-23):  The delay in starting this work was
due to management negligence, and underestimating the period of
execution, in addition to excavation problems caused by water
and terrain difficulties. Problems with the contractor
owing to both his internal problems and work difficulties,
have caused the mechanical completion of the shaft to be
rescheduled for August 1983. Because of this, several
agreements were concluded to solve the field problems
existing at the start of the work.
Mine services (EC-37): This contract Was terminated and
is being liquidated. Because of the late start,
technical-financial deficiencies, and the inexperience
demonstrated by the contractor, this contract was cancelled and
the work was taken over directly by Centromin Peru.



-24-
STRETC OUT OF CO8RIZA PRCJIECr ACTrVITIES FROM THE ORIGINAL IBRD SCHEDULE
-    The actual date of signature of the contract with the project managers
is May 26, 1977, which is two years after the date originally programmed by
the Bank.
-    The se-vices of the project managers were suspended from February 10, 1978, to
May. 22, 1979, because of lack of sources of ftinancIng.
-    For the above reasons, detailed engineering services began on November 1,
1979, and were completed on December 30, 1981L
-    Because of the above delays, the plant's mechanical work was not
coapleted until May 29, 1982, despite the CmP's development and
implemention of a crash program.
-    Procurement and civil works began in 1980 and were completed in May 1982.
-    1Mine development and services began in 1980. Work has continued to date
and is expectea to be completed by late-Septer-aber 1983. The delay in
the mine preparation and development activities scheduled by the managers
is due to the inefficiency of the project managers, and its failure to meet
its work schedule, particularly the minr development works (this work was
taken over directly by CENTROMIN.
-    The Mantaro-Cobriza electric power line was completed in May 1981, with a
slight delay because of slippage in the supply of substation equipment.
-    Mine development continues under way, and design capacity is expected to be
reached when the production shaft is completedL

Nine Planning: Because of deficiencies and delays in the mine planning
sublmitted by the amanagers, the cortapany had to intervene in preparing It
when this activity was already in a critical phase. This caused delays
in start-up of the development work and preparation of the mine, so that
these works had to be taken over by Centromin Peru. In aodition, the
contractor, did not meet contract deadlines.
Tailings thickener:  The design and supervision of the thickener works
were entirely the responsibility of the managers. Because of ground
faults, bad compacting and design errors, the structure collapsed twice.
For that reason, the CMP decided on another system for water supply, and
abandoned the thickener system. The new system involves pumping water
from the mantaro river and is fully under way. Legal action has been
taken against the firuas responsible for the problems.

g)   Cost of Capital, Financing and Disbursement
(i) Table 2 shows, by investment category, the original, actual and
forecast cost, in both local and foreign currency.
(ii) The cost of the projects, partially finance  by the World Bank
in 1976, was US$176.2 million, of which US$160.9 million went
to the Cobriza Project and US$15.3 million went to the mine
Water Project.
After a suspension of about 16 months because of financi
problems in the project for expanding the Cobriza mine a
concentrator, the Peruvian government, the international
financing agencies and the company itself took a number of
actions and decisions to enable the project to be resumed.
In fact, after exhaustive studies to determine the amount of
investment, taking into consideration among other factors
1) cost increases because of the time elapsed,
2) addition of required project items that had been omitted
in the original study,
3) and complete maintenance of the concentrator plant in Pampa
de Coris,
in April 1979, the investment was adjusted, since the project
was to resume by July 1, 1979. The project estimate at that
time was US$181.3 million, a figure used for the economic
analyses. The breakdown for this amount is shown in a table.
In December 1979, the managers prepared and submitted to
Centromin a new investment budget of USS240,661,000. This new
estimate was substantially increased over the one drawn up in
April 1979, mainly because of:
-- Revision of the mining plan.
--  Escalation during the months the project was suspended, which
was reflected in a considerable increase in the equipment,
materials and spare parts to be purchased abroad.
- Variation in the exchange rate of national currency against
foreign currency, because of the high local inflation
forecasted for the project execution period.
AS is usual in investAment projects of this size, the kanagers
readjusted the estimate monthly according to the direct cost
tren2s, but without substantial variations, except for the
estimate submlitted in November 1980 to the CMP, which was
exhaustively reviewed by the GEP and cut from US$277,U53,00W to
US$261,242,000 in March 1981. Later, at the suggestion of the
C-EP, closer participation in u-pdating the estimated-costs for
project completion was established, which made it possible to
cut the budget submitted by tne managers to US$240 million.
This forecast was estimated based on the CMP commitments as of
may 31, 1983, which amounted to US$222.98 million.

(iiL) To cut the cost increases resulting from the programming
prepared by the managers, which scheduled the mechanical
completion of the plant in Novenmber 1982, the Centromin
Department of Project Execution prepared and implemented a
crash program and offered financial incentives to the
contractors to advance the completion dates of civil
construction and electrozaechanical assembly. This made it
possible to complete those works before the date set in the
crash prograu (June 1983).
The congruence of these factors and the establishment of proper
budget control by the GEP, through analysis, review and direct
participation in the periodic updating of tbe forecast final
cost for completion of the project, made it possible to cut
project costs substantially. As mentioned in the above
paragraph, this reduced the budget submitted by the managers in
November 1980 from US$277 million to US$259 million in the
first revision, a figure that was succe,sively adjusted through
the cost control procedures pre-established by the GEP.
In addition, Centronin Peru used its own resources to design
and execute the hydraulic fill system, redesigned the mining
plan, and constructed the railways throughout the mine. In
addition, it hired local engineering services for the detailed
design of several industrial buildings, such as surface and
underground workshops, locomotive workshops, painting and tires
shop, and so on, which made it possible to begin construction
of them before the scheduled time.
moreover, when it was found that the project management was not
entirely satisfactory because of the characteristics of the
project and because qualified personnel was not available,
especially for rine discipline, and taking into consideration
that a cost plus contract had been concluded with them, which
because of its characteristics would increase the expected
final cost, the demobilization of the management staff was
rescheduled so that it would take place as soon as possible.
(iv) Comparismn between the original and actual financing plans
The original financing plan estiraated the total investment of
US$176.2 million, of which US$160.9 million was for the Cobriza
Mine Project and US$15.3 million went to the Mine Water Plant
Project. These amounts are covered with funds from the IBRD,
IDB and COFIDE loans, and the project's own funds (See Table
3.3).
In implementing both projects, it was found necessary to make
substantial chanyes in the financing plan, mainly because of
cost overruns, especially for Cobriza, and the sizeable
reduction in the COFIDE loan from US$99.8 million to US$5.4
million. The resulting financing gap brought the Cobriza
project to a halt early in 1978.



-32-
Because of the increased fund requirements, Centromin Peru,
after gettlng the authorization required, arranged for
additional loans in foreign and local currency and for
contributions from the federal government through direct
suRport and support for capitalization of taxes and through IDB
loans (48/XC-PE) and (352/OC-PE). The latter loans became part
of the company's capitaL In addition, the disbursement
deadlines for the IBRD and the IDB loans were expanded from
four to six years for horld Bank loans and from four and a half
to six and a half years for the IDB loan.
Table 3.3 shows the current financing plan for both projects.
Table 3.4 shows the characteristics of the loans extended for
participation in financing both projects.
(v) System for management of financial resources
The system used to manage the financial resources provided by
the World Bank takes into consideration the two opposing
currents represented by the agencies providing and using those
funds. In this connection, the project management negotiated
the form of payment with suppliers, and the procedure adopt.ed
was to make payrient for goods and/or services against
submission of documents, letters of credit, etc.  Having
defined these conditions, they were reported to the financing
agency concerned to request payuent through disbursements
(direct andor reimbursement) or to request guarantees of
reimbursement for letters of credit.
In most commitments, bridge loans have been used for timely
disbursement of the arount due the supplier, and these amounts
have been paid with the reimXbursement from the financial agency
of the project. While this system raised the project's costs,
the increases were justified by the discounts received, and for
that reason, incurred costs were lower. In addition, this made
early delivery of the equipment purchased possible, which was
of great importance in implementing the project.
Letters of credit were used when required, and commitments were
made from the time credit was opened with the financing agency,
as established.
In handling financing from the IDB, the above-mentioned system
was employed, and advance payment for future expenditures were
made, which substantially lowered the aaount of the bridge
loans required.



-33-
Freely available credits were used as required (expenditures in
local currency), and the same was true for buyers credits
(Swiss loans in the Cobriza project), in which the u&ode of
payment was defined when the loan was extenled.
In addition Peruvian Government funds were used to cover local
costs, particularly customs duties and income taxes on
flfidomiciled firms, for which notes were employed as the form
of contribution.
(vi) The disbursement programs of the World Bank loans were altered
substantially because of changes in the execution program of
both projects. For the Cobriza project, this shift became
substantial, because of the approximately one and a half year
suspension of this project from early 1978.
Based on the foregoing, extension of the loan disbursement
period to 31 December 1982 was negotiated (the original date
was 31 December 1980).
The loan disbursement program coincided with the progress of
the projects, and the largest disbursement for Cobriza was in
the second half of 1980 up to the end of 1981 and in the Mine
Water Project from the start of 1979 to the second half of 1980
(see Table 3.1).
The amounts budgeted by category varied with the actual fund
requirements for specific categories, due mainly to higher
costs for the project!s goods and/or services, and the terms of
the additional loans extended, particularly regarding the
nationality of goods purchased. The latter compronmised the
amounts of certain equipment with some financial resources.
The pari-passu percentage financed was maintained throughout
the project, as originally established (see Table 3.2).

(vii) Problems in the world Bank's Disbursement Procedures
Several problems have been found in the IIRDs loan
disbursement procedures regarding the timing of disbursements.
Specifically, some disbursement requests were only partially
met, apparently because purchase orders and/or exchange orders
were not submitted or because bidding documents were not
approved, so that receipt of the amount requested was delayed.
In addition, confirmation of disbursenents has been received
after their effective date, which prevented the net amounts
available in the project's account from being known.
we believe that these problems can be solved in time if there
is better coordination between the areas involved, and
regarding the problem in the previous paragraph, the borrower
sbould be informed by telex of the tiue of each disbursement.
These measures will enable funds to be obtained on time, and
therefore, to reduce the gap between submission of the
disbursement request and confirmation of it. There is one
aspect of this subject that deserves special attention, and
that is the length of processing of a disbursement request.
The problem begins with the inappropriate rethod of resission
by maiL. On average, a disbursement takes 40 days from the
time the request is sent. This has caused bridge funds to be
preferred for paying suppliers, and these funds were later
reimbursed by the bank.
on the other hand, we recognize that the disbursement system
has produced good results where there has been appropriate
coordination.
(viii) Performance of other lenders
Commercial loans extended to finance the projects have been
freely available and have required a simpLt disbursement
procedure. Therefore, the more complicated requirements for
disbursement requests, such as the World Bank procedures, and
to a considerable extent those of the IDB and EXIfBANK, were
eliminated. However, EXIMBANK deserves special mention because
of the rigidity and more complicated requirements of its
procedures, which has caused delays in receipt of
cisburseu-ents. rhe timeliness of disbursement by the financing
agency has been the difficulty encountered with this type of
credit.
In addition, the reduction in the amount of the COFIDE loan
caused a substantial change in the projects' financing plan.
This reduction was brought about by Perus difficult economic
and financial situation in 1977-78, when the government was
forced to cut its capital contributions to COFIDE and that
agency had to decrease its contributions of funds earmarked for
implementing project



-40-
After this situation, a loan in national currency was agreed
upon with COFXDE for US$14.5 million equivalent, which has not
been entirely disbursed because of that agency's liquidity
limitations.
It should also be mentioned that, while the World Bank granted
an extension in the loan disbursement deadline because the
project coiqpletion date was deferrec, the bank did not grant an
extension for starting the repayment period, or in any case, a
reduction in the amount of initial amortization payments, since
the loan had not been entirely disbursed. This caused an
additional cost, which Centrorain Peru had to cover.
(ix) Table 4 shows the disbursement schedule for 1976-83.
II$. OPERATIONS PERFOHMANCE
a)  Plant Tests and Star
(1) The major problems encountered in the plant startup were as
follows: the electric locomotives bad to be modified to pass
through the loading station of the bottom dump cars. The low
capacity of the hopper under the crusher did not permit
continuous unloading of the mine cars if the ore contained the
usual amount of fines, so that cars had to be unloaded
Intermittently instead of continuously. The delays in
developing and working the mine shaft prevented Centromin Peru
from extracting the ore below level 2&8 As a result, mine
production is not up to design capacity because only the stopes
above level 28 can be worked. A large amount of fines dust
originating in the storage zone has caused the electric
substation equipment to malfunction.
Large breaks occurred in the concrete cone slap of the tailings
thickener because of subsidence under the structure.
(ii) one problem in the plant startup, the modification of the
locortotives, caused a delay of about one monti. However, the
problem has now been entirely solved. In the primary crushing
system, the problem still fiersists, so that ore has to be
hauled in three sh.ifts to make up for the time lost in
unloading the trains. A claim has been made against the
managers who are responsible for designing the primary crushing
system, and the performance bond is Deing executed.
The ore from the level 10 stopes cannot be extracted at this
tire because the mine shaft and its installations are not yet
ready. This means that the amount of ore needed to reach the
desiyn capacity of the concentrator plant cannot be extracted
yet. Starting July 9, 1983, the CNtP will impose a contractual
penalty on the contractor which performed the work.

Pollution in the fines storage area continues to cause
malfunctions in the adjacent substation, which has compelled
Centroauin Peru to install a pressurization and air conditioning
system.
The tailings thickener cannot be used because of the serious
settlement that occurred during its construction, which
coiopelled Centroimin Peru to install another water supply system
for low water periods. Payment for dariages to the thiLckener
have been negotiated with one contractor, and a claim has been
made against the contractor responsible for the compacted filL
In addition, a claim has b en made against the managers of the
project, responsible for the design and supervision of the
thickener construction.
(iii) The managers drew up the plant test and startup program in
coordination with Centromin Peru. Specialized experts of the
managers were assigned to the various areas to carry out the
program, and they were entirely responsible for this work.
The technical staff of Centromin Peru and contractors gave full
support to the managers in providing equipment, labor and
supvlenaentary facilities needed to achieve this objective. The
coordinated work of the managers, Centromin Peru and the
contractors made it jossiole to carry out the crash construction
program to start up the plant on May 30, 1982.
b)  Work Force
(i) The project was managed on the basis of a time schedule for
personnel requirenments, both for managers and their national
associates. Project activities were implemented in the
USA, Lita and Cobriza. The managers had to hire specialized
personnel in each field, and the national firm provided
additional technical staff in Peru. In addition, Centromin
Peru provided through its Project Administration the
experienced technical staff required to represent the
enterprise and coordinate the work. For some of the main
plant, mine and services equipment, the managers and Centromin
Peru assigned technical personnel for inspection and final
delivery. In addition, they were given training in some areas
of their specialized field.
In implementing the project, the managers encountered many
personnel rotation problems, since many of the managers'
technical staff had to be replaced because of deficiencies. The
main staff problem was in the mine area, because needed
specialists were not available. This gap was filled with the
aid of Centror,min Peru specialists.
The Cobriza Expansion Project for the Mine and Concentrator
required a hwaan resources infrastructure in keeping with the
voluziLe of work and the aiL,ount of investuient involved.

In May 1979, a staff organizational chart was defined with
dynarmic criteria, taking into account that minor changes would
be required in the structure during the perforancie of the
work.
The firm selected to manage this project provided the foreign
staff required for the organizational structure mentioned, and
asked Centrojuin Peru to take charge of all human resources
management, as stipulated in our labor laws. So in Septeiaber
1979, Centroiain peru providea, through its Industrial Relations
Department, an agency in charge of recruitment, selection,
hiring, training, and other personnel managerent functions.
From 1979 to date, this departnent has also been responsible
for the already specified functions of wage acministration,
labor relations, and social welfare and education prograr's. An
important achievelment is tne fact that during this period (1979
to date) no interruption in the work occurred for reasons of
work stoppage or strikes,

In implementing the Cobriza Project, no specific CmP staff
training program was set up for a specified period, but actions
were establislhed to be carried out on resuzaption of basic
engineering extension by the project managers, such as:
- Appointment of a CMP representative in the U.S. offices,
who would approve and return all plans, documents and
technical information to the project managers within five
days. This action was taken to speed up the basic enginee.ring. The *]S
representative, a sp.ecialist in structural design, was at that
post from July 1979 to September 1980. Also during thal:
period, the CmP specialized staff were assigned to the
managers' offices, both in the Operations Division, and in the
Project Execution Division to 1.articipate in review and
determination of the final scope of the project expansion in
various fields, suchi as:

-    Mine Engineering (2 professionals)
-    Electrical Engineering (2 professionals)
-    Civil and Structural Engineering (2 professionals)
-    Mechanical Engineering (2 professionals)
During the period for procurement of materials and equipment,
follow-up of purchase arnd inspection of the manufacturing of
both foreign and national suppliers was the responsibility of
the managers, who, through their offices in USA, and their
affilia:es in other countries, sent specialized technicians
for inspections and tests.

Only in a few cases did the CMP assign technical and
professional staff to some countries for final inspection and
training in the equipment purchased for the project, such as:
- Xray analyzer
2 "gs.               7 days
- Electrical Equipment
2 Engs.              5 days
- Electric Locouotives

1 Eng.
- In addition, practical technical training courses were givqn in
Peru by the C2P training department for mine area personnel,
operating in maintenance work on the various equipment
purchased for working the mine.
This training proqram involved the following personnel:
Men in        Class    Man
Course         Hours    Hours
Mine Operators         334            620      3,340

TOTAL           1,160          1,810    11,600
Note that this training program was conducted by the CMP
training department, whose staff translated manuals, drew up
the training plan, selected nine operators, coordinated the
mechanical and psychotechnical examinations, and set up a mine
school for this purpose.
In addition, the suppliers of some equipment for both the mine
and the concentrator plant sent representatives to Peru for
startup of operations aria tests with and without load. After
startup, some equipmennt suppliers instructed the CMP technical-
professional st,zx on maintenance of the equipment.
c)   Organization of the Borrower
(i) 'rhe Project Administration provided coordination between the
managers and Centromin Peru and acted as the official
representative of the comIpany. It was comLposed of experienced
professionals in the fields of management, engineerilg,



-48-
procurement, and so oam This organization was maintained with
slight changes throughout the project, and help was provided by
the specialized offices of Centromin Peru in engineerinyj,
logistics, finance, and so onr
The organization tables of the administration and the managers
are included, and in general have not changed their structure
to date (Tables 0-1 and D-2). However, it should be noted that
Centromin Peru substantially increased its participation in the
mine development and preparation work, for which purpose it had
to establish a field unit to take over the managers
responsibilities in the mining area.
(ii) To carr'y out the Cobriza Project, the Company had to set up and
improve theproject accounting area. In addition, Centromin had
to create in both Liria and Cobriza specialized areas such as
financing, logistics, industrial relations, information
science, traffic and custoims clearance and an operations
division for the mine, plant and services. The Project
Execution Division participated actively in coordinating the
work performed at the company leveL
d)   Work Force Increase
Project activities required an increase in the Cobriza work force,
as broken down below:
2600 $IS=        20,000 I'NS

d)  Production and Capacity EstStQ
(i) The following table shows productior for may-December 1982 and
January-June 1983 (Table E)..
(11) The main problems that prevented the program estimate from
being attained are the following:.
Mine Probleurs
-    Failure to complete the production shaft (contractor).
-    Failure to complete mine development work-ore pass,
stopes, zig-zags5 etc. (contractor).
-    Failure to complete mine services works-underground
workshops, ventilation, etc. (contractor).
-    Technical difficulties with the DUyK low profile trucks
(supplier).
-    Low grade of the copper ore.
Plant Problems
-    Primary crusher (design).
-    ore transport system (supplier).
-    Primary and secondary crusher belts (supplier).
- rTailings thickener (design-contractor).
-   Filters (supplier).
In all cases, the company solved the problems through the
Project Execution Department and the Operations Division, made
the changes required, and took alternative steps to permit
continuous operation of the concentrator plant. The problems
that prevented meeting the production schedules were due in
some cases to engineering design errors and in others to poor
performance and quality of the equipment as well as poor
performance of the contractors.
(iii) The projects future production is as follows (in tons of 26%
CU concentrates).

d)   Envirornental Pollution
(1) The possibility of solving the problem of tailings disposal of
the new concentrator plant by building one or more dumps to
store the solicis is limited or almost nonexistent because of
the number of major and even overwhelming difficulties and/or
technical complexities and risk factors, the extremely high
cost, or shortage of capacity.
Dumping tailings into the Mantaro river has some impact on the
river but it would not be major. In the present circumstances,
that would be the least damaging and most practical course of
action.
In addition, using most of the tailings (55 to 65%) as mine
fill means that the tonnage of unutilized tailings dumped by
the new plant is only 7a% higher than the tailings dumped by
the old plant.
(ii) The physical-chemical analyses of the plant tailings shows that
the impact of the liquid tailings on the Mantaro water course
wOuld be completely negligible (Table 10.
For example, when manganese, one of the major components (.860
milligrams/liter of sample) is diluted in the river water, the
result is .29 micrograms/liter of river water, which is.about
1/20O0 of the permissible level for class III water courses,
under the Peruvian Waters Act.
Several -components of the solid wastes would exceed the
permissible ceilings for class III water courses. However, it
should be noted that the high density (3.6), the moderate water
velocity and the long length of the river before it flows into
the Apurimac River promote sedimentation of these materials so
that farming areas along the river would not be affected.

The World Bank took an active part from the outset in 1976 in
arrantements with other foreign and local financial institutions and
re ee  that Centrom.in take direct or indirect action to implenment
the loan as soon as possible.
To achieve that goal, it coordinated, through the CMP, expansion of the
Cobriza mine to 10,000 tpd with Peruvian government and financial
agencies and the WI. In addition, it drew up with specialists of that
financial institution and the IDB an investment estimate of $160.9 and
concluded a loan contract on 6/1Z/76.
During the project, World Bank staff members held coordination meetings
with the project managers to improve their efficiency in carrying out
basic engineering extension, procurement, detailed engineering and plant
construction, and particularly, mine preparation and development works.
in addition, it coordinated procurement procedures for material and
equipment dir.ctly with Centromin Peru, so that Bank staff members
travel to Lima and Cobriza to inspect the progress of the work under way
and supervise appropriate use of its loan to Centromin Peru.

I.  PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PRELIMINARY FEASIBILITY AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES
The Cerro de Pasco Mine Water Treatment Plant was a necessity that had been strong-
ly felt in order to replace a cementation operation that was excessively contamina-
ting the basin of the Mantaro [River] and that furthermore, in medium-range
terms, would suffer from a shortage of its main input items [scrap iron) nation-
wide.
For these reasons, Centromin Peru contracted consultants in 1974 for preparing a
technical-economic study to replace the existing process with another extraction
process using solvents and electroplating whose operating capacity would be as
follows:
(a) Treatment of 13,600 lit/min of impregnated solution for extraction by means
of solvents;
(b) 0.8 g/lit of copper concentration for 1976
0. g/lit Of copper concentration 1986;
(c) 480 metric t of copper recoverable monthly by the middle of 1976
366 metric t of copper recoverable monthly by the middle of 1981
276 metric t of copper recoverable monthly by the middle of 1986.
Furthermore, the feasibility project took into consideration che fact that the
new plant would be located in the immediate vicinity of the Excelsior Cement
Plant, that there would be a preliminary neutralization stage to treat the
products from the solvent extraction stage, and that, finally, the waste would
be subjected to a neutralization process prior to being dumped into the San
Juan River. The amount earmarked for investment came to U.S.$11,818,000 at
constant 1974 dollars.
These proposals were amended throughout the project and the design was completed
with the following features:
Output capacity 540 metric t of Cu per month;
Location in the area of Quiulacocha due to the fact that the previously selected
area did not have the kind of soil that was suitable for the construction work
that had to be started;
Elimination of the preneutralization phase, improving the quality of impregnated
solutions through the construction of new copper mineral cells;
.Temporary substitution of the neutralization process through the storage of
waste in Yanamate Lagoon;
The investment amount rose to U.S.$15,300,000 at current dollars.
The World Bank expressed its interest particularly in financing this project by
the middle of 1975 and, after the corresponding negotiations and the updating of
the budgec, loan contract 1281-PE was signed on December 6, 1976.

During this period of time, prior to the start of work, our enterprise had the
resolute cooperation of specialists from the consultant and frosu the World
Bank in spelling out the project's scope.

I1. PROJECT I1PLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
(a) Project Scope
The project's objective and scope are designed mainly to contribute to the
decontamination of the tributaries of the upper basin of the Mantaro River by
eliminating the dumping of acid-ferrous solutions, waste from cementation
operations of copper vith scrap iron, thus making the transfer of water from
that river to the Pacific feasible.
The above is made possible through the installation of an integrated extraction
circuit using solvents, electroplatilg, and related operations, this vill permit
the production of 99.96% electrolytic copper as finished product, directly
saleable as cathodes with a higher added value, replacing 925 metric t of copper
cement; it will thus be possible to eliminate the use of scrap iron and to
release the treatment capacity in the La Oroya Foundry and Refinery Circuit.
During project execution, we saw the need for partly amending the originally
planned scope, mainly relating to the subsequent treatment of plant waste; this
appreciably increased the cost of the copper that was produced. In this way
and following approval by the financing agencies, it was decided to discharge
said waste into che Yanamate Basin.
The main changes that were made along these lines were as follows:
Reject the preneutralization unit;
Eliminate the solvent extractionwaste neutralization unit;
Eliminate the limestone preparation unit;
Include a system for pumping SX -- solvent extraction - waste from the diecharge point
in the plant to the closed basin of Yanamate.
(b) Project Administration-
The system employed in project administration included the project management
system on the level of the foreign consultant  outfit under the supervision of
the Projects Execution Management Office of CMP.
For this purpose, we contracted for the services of foreign consultants, who,
associated with a local consulting firm, were responsible for project management.
The work of the managers basically included activities dealing with basic
engineering, detail engineering, purchasing management, construction supervision,
training, start-up and standardization of the plant. This work was distributed
primarily as shown below:

Parallel to the work done by the managers, Centromin Peru, through its Operations
Division, was charged with doing the work necessary outside the battery boundary
which included work relating to the activities initially planned.
Project execution was appreciably influenced by the effort and coordination of
the outfits responsible for the project with respect to management activities
dealing with suppliers of goods and/or services as well as contractors for the
a.velopment of works projects activities.  This facilitated acceptablt and
timely planning for project implementation
(c) Manager Performance
In general terms, the work of the managers was done in accordance with estimates;
however, some inconveniences arose during project development and led to stricter
supervision by CHP.
This was particularly true of work outside the battery boundary since this
activity had not been conceptualized from the project study, done by the managers,
on; this meant that these work operations were taken over by the Enterprise.
On the other hand, concerning equipment design, specifically in the case of
the electroplating rectifier transformer, there was a mistake in the dimensioning
and this caused problems at the moment of plant start-up so that the plant had
to be shut down for a period of 5 months, approximately, during which CMP was
able to solve the above-mentioned problem. This type of deficiency became
evident basically in the electromechanical equipment items.
Another significant aspect of managerial performance relates to the shortcoming
that emerged in project control and supervision--activities which were directed
without standards that would be acceptable to the Enterprise. This caused the
intervention of CPM in terms of the takeover of these administrative activities.



-73-
(d) Contractor and Supplier Performance
The activities carried out by contractors and suppliers were in line with the
terms agreed upon between them and the project managers. Generally speaking,
the job was done properly, under realistic working conditions, featuring the
delivery of equipment units and the completion of work activities; the latter
were accomplished with greater difficulty due to environmental conditions in
the project area.
It must also be pointed out that the quality of most of the equipment items
acquired is adequate for a project of the kind that involves mine water, except
for the rectifier transformer which failed on two occasions and the centrifugal
pumps.
(e) Logistics
The system used for the purchase of goods and/or services for the Mine Water
Project was standardized in accordance with the outlines established by the
project financing entities.
In this respect, purchasing management was under the control of the project
managers who made good recommer.dations during the bidding competition carried
out for the procurement of goods and/or services. The information was analyzed
by the CMP and forwarded to the Bank for approval prior to the award of these
purchasing contracts.
Procurements, as far as foreign suppliers were concerned, were handled mostly
through letters of credit which committed the funds from the bank loans in the
respective proportion!s (IBRD 55Z,BID 45%).
In this sense, purchasing management--through established bidding competition
regulations-did not present any major difficulties.
A separate sheet contains the diagram for the procedure involved in getting
supplies and approving purchasing orders in excess of U.S.S100,000.
(f) Execution Program Implementation
Table 1 shows comparisons between the estimate and the actual programming. The
major factor that caused problems in plant operation was the failure of th^l
rectifier which caused the plant to be closed down. After the changing of thF rectifier
transformer, operationswere actually started on January 11, 1982, in other words,
the plart was started 65 days ahead of time compared to the planned starting date
of March 17, 1983 [sic].

MINE WATER PROJECT ACTIVITY SCHEDULING CHANGES ACCORDING TO IBRD PROGRAM
The effective date of the contract with the managers was May 26, 1977; compared to
the date initially scheduled by the World Lank, this was a delay of almost two
years.
However, basic engineering was newly started on September 1, 1977, due to the
fact that the requirement for its official start by the managers involved the
metallurgical tests that were carried out by CMP so that this project stage
was finished on March 31, 1978.
In the light of the above, detail engineering was started on January 30, 1978,
and was completed on May 30, 1979.
Procurement began 2 months after the start of detail engineering and the delivery
of equipment and materials was completed in October 1980.
The mechanical completion of the plant came on February 7, 1981.

(g) Capital Expenditures. Outlays, and Financing
The project's final cost came to U.S.$15.3 million according to the budget esti-
mate, of which U.S.$8.7 million went for expenses of local origin while U.S.$6.6
million were connected with expenses of foreign origin.
Table No. 2 presents a comparison between the project's estimated and actual
costs, broken down by investment items and identifying the origin of the expend-
iture for each one of them.
In this connection it is necessary to mentlon the fact that, although the project's
scope was reduced with regard to plant waste treatment, the total cost remained
the same due to a considerable increase in the engineering, administration, and
supervision items, as well as in the corresponding civil engineering work and
electromechanical assembly and installation; the latter items led to increased
spending in local currency.
The project investment schedule is shown in Table No. 4 and indicates that the
major expenditures for the project were made in 1979 and 1980. The amounts
invested in 1981-1982 correspond to the payments and to unexpected amounts
arising from the plant's start-up.
As far as project financing is concerned, it was covered by funds from the World
Bank, from the Inter-American Development Bank, Financial Development Corporation,
the Peruvian government, and in-house funds. Table 3.3 shows the funding source
for project financing, broken down by expenditure origin.
A significant aspect of project finance management was rooted in the reduction
of_the COFIDE [Financial Development Corporation] loan which meant that Centromin-
Peru, together with the Peruvian Government, closed the financing gap caused by
the difficult economic situation of that corporation.
Funds from the above-indicated sources were controlled through the Enterprise.
In relation to that, payment requests were filled out with the financing enti-
ties and we opted mainly for repayment guarantee procedures based on letters of
credit for the payment of suppliers of goods and direct payment in the case of.
payment for services. Parallel to that, in the specific case of the BID [Inter-
American Development Bank] loan, we used the rotating fund procedure through which
said entity, by way of an advance, paid out a sum of money which was then authen-
ticated during the corresponding period of payment. This latter procedure was
chosen for direct purchases involving smaller amounts.
As for COFIDE funds, they were used mainly by way of reimbursement of payments
made while funds coming from the Peruvian Government were used basically to pay
for import duties and for the income taxes cf companies not domiciled in the
country.
Coordination with these financing entites and the broad range of procedures
used made it possible to implement acceptable management at the time of the outlays
with the exception of direct payments that took a longer time than anticipated,
causing problems of an administrative character. Another aspect worth mentioning
-which emerged during this project-sprang from the rather slight control on the
part of the World Bank on the occasion of the repayment of letters of credit to
the correspondent bank. This caused an increase in financing expenditures



-80-
that had to be paid out for the period during which the outlays of the correspondent
bank remained unpaid. We believe that it is advisable to suggest that deadlines
be established for the correspondent banks when it comes to requesting the cor-
responding reimbursements from the World Bank.

111. OPERATION PERFOL'ANCE
(a) Initial Start-Up and Start of Operations
According to the project's development as planned in the Projects Management
Contract with the managers on February 7, 1981, the plant was ready as far as
the mechanical part was concerned. This marked the beginning of the period of
running trials which lasted until the 14th of that month; at that time it was
necessary to shut the plant down due to the deadlock with local public agencies
over the use of Yanamate Lagoon.
Due to these difficulties, it was possible to start the standardization period
only on April 24, 1981; following the construction of an alternate system of
tributaries to Quiulacocha Lagoon and to Yanamate Lagoon, using a pumping system,
the project was turned over to the Operations Division of Centromin Peru on June
16, 1981; during that period, around 500 t of electrolytic copper with 99.98Z
purity had been produced; this period extended until July 24, 1981, at which time due
to serious breakdowns in the commercial cell circuit transformer, procured by the
management firm from the supplier, the plant had to suspend normal production
until January 11, 1982; this was because the rectifier transformer had to be
manufactured all over again by another firm; the latter had taken over the assets
and liabilities of its predecessor.
While the plant was shut down, it was necessary to restart the production of
copper cement due to ion drift in the CU [sic] cementation plant, vhich is why
there were no losses in the production of copper.
During the time the plant was shut down, moreover, plant maintenance personnel
performed various minor repairs and modifications, such as: Modification of
electroplating cell crane, repair of electroplating cells, system of sulfuric
acid addition, among others.
(b) Labor Force Development
Project management as such was implemented in accordance with the organiza-
tional structure submitted to Centromin Peru by the project managers after
the contract with Centromin Peru had been signed.
The project managers, as well as the project administration recruited professional
and technical personnel on the basis of a requirement timetable which was
adequately met; in accordance with the project execution stages, detail
engineering, local purchasing management and construction supervisi3n were
executed by the managers. Parallel to that, Centromin Peru selected experienced
and technical personnel through the Project Administration for the purpose
of representing the Enterprise.
The training pro-ram for personnel who would be responsible for operating the
Cerro de Pasco Mine Water Treatment Plant was carried out and supervised by
the project managers in coordination with the project administrator.
This program's scope included familiarization with the new plant's Operating
Manual, with the operation of other plants, both in the United States and in
Peru. The preparatory effort was worked out with. the proper headstart in terms
of the scheduled completion uo  thc mechanical part.



-89-
The following staff personnel stood out in this program in the United States:
General manager, assistant general manager, metallurgists and guard detail
leader; the training period in that country extended from July 21 until August
10, 1981.
The outstanding staff personnel at Arequipa (Cerro Verde) and at Cerro de Pasco
included the following: General manager, assistant general manager, metallurgist,
maintenance chief and four guard detail leaders; their training courses extended
from August 18 to 29, 1981, and from September 2 to 6, 1980, respectively.
(c) Centromin Peru Personnel Organization
There were no changes in the original organizational structure of the Project
Administration as well as in the Projects Execution Management Office.
Through its Administrative Division, the Projects Execution Management Office
substantially improved the general information systems and procedures on request
of the financing entities and in coordination with the project managers a manual
procedure was implemented for recording costs, obligations, and the final estimated
cost of the project; computerized programs were also used for programing and
checking on project progress, using a computerized package implemented by
Centromin Peru.  Likewise, accounting procedures were established for
the recording of expenditures as well as foreign and local purchasing procedures
which would meet the requirements established by the financing institutions.
In coordination with the Finance Management Office, the projects execution
management office prepared a manual procedure for requests and recording of
foreign and local currency disbursements which met the requirements of the fi-
nancing entities.
Plant operation and maintenance were taken over by the Centromin Peru Operations
Division through adequate organization once the plant was ready to go into
standard operation.

(d) Environmental Pollution
The objective of decontaminating the Mantaro River was accomplished 100% since
the acid tailings from the plant were no longer discharged into that river follow-
ing the final start-up of the plant whicn happened in January 1982.
1. Water Lejel in Yanamate Lagoon
The lagoon has been receiving acidic-ferrous solvent extraction waste since
January 12, 1982. The infformation supplied covers the period of January to April,
in other words, the period of greater rainfall. The water level rose from 4,345.51
to 4,347.08 m above sea level, in other words, 1.57 m for a period of 77 days or
2 cm per day. This is apparently very fast which is why we must point out that
the area that currently gets the waste resembles an inverted cone which explains
this rapid increase; however, it must be mentioned that the receiving area's
surface will increase since this cone is located in the lagoon's center. We are
also studying alternate processes for recycling the tailings.
2. Rainfall
Statistics for a period of 15 years give us an average of 855 mm/m per year
while the annual evaporation on the lagoons in the area reveals a similar evapora-
tion rate which is why the precipitation and the evaporation compensace each
other annually.
3. Waste Flow and Makeup
Solvent extraction waste at design capacity is deposited in the Yanamate Basin
at a rate of 3,200 gpm, with the following makeup:
Component           Content, gpl   Compcnent         Content, gpl
pH      ......  1.2               Zn ................  1.1
Cu ...................  0.05      As ....               0.10
FecT ...      ....  11.0          Cr ..00....  001
Fe .           .................  8.6  C1 ................  0.03
Si ...................  0.09      Mn ................  0.25
Al .....  0.05                    Sb ................  0.01
Ni ......... C0.01                Ca ................  0.02
Pb ...................  0.01      Ga ................  0.01
H2S04 .......      ....  10.0      Na ...............   2.6
Ti .<...... . 0.01   Si .<0.01
Co ..........     .... <0.01      Mg .0.26
Cd.                 <0.01
4. pH of Water in Yanamate Basin
The natural water stored in the Yanamate Basin has a pH of 1.8.
The influx of waste from extraction by means of solvents at this time has not
managed to bring about a uniform content in the lagoon. In any case, the volume
that has been mixed indicates a pH of 1.8.



-98-
5. Precipitation of Iron
The sedimentary layer that forms the basin's bed is a very fine chalk with 51%
CaO or 91% Ca CO3, a reagent that acts as a neutralizer of the acid and a pre-
cipitator of the iron, both of which are contained in solvent extraction waste.
It must be noted that this process is partial and of a limited nature.
The possible reactions take place in the following kinetic order:
a. H2SO4  +  CaCo3  + H20  4  CaS04.2H20  +  Co2 t
b. Fc2(S04)3  +  3CaCo3  + 9H20  -- 2Fe(OH)3 + 3 CaSOi.ZH 20 + 3CO2t
C. cuso4  +CaCo3  +I42O -   Cu (OH)2  +CaSo4  +  Co2t
In the course of contact between the solid and the liquid, Fe 3 precipitates
with a pH of 2.6 to 4.5 in a colloidal form at ambient temperature; the coagula-
tion improves starting at a pH of 3.7, a condition which is attained in the
interphase and the samehappens in the case of copper.   The precipitation of
other polluting ions takes place at a pH above 5.0 which would appear to take
place for a very short time in the interphase; this is why we do not expect any
greater impact on the makeup; in any case, the sequential activiry would be the
same with zinc and cadmium. Fe2+ does not change since it requires oxygenation
and a pH above 5.0, something which does not materialize.
The gels produced here, mechanically supplemented by crystallized gypsum, bring
about a diminution in the penetration of the solution through the chalk bed and
the bed rock; it eventually turns out to be zero and therefore the reactivity
is terminated. This is a good thing since it makes the bed of the Yanamate
Lagoon completely impermeable, thus preventing the filtration of acid solutions
at other points.
6. Apparent Porosity of Lagoon's Bottom
Geophysical methods were used to determine the depths of the bed rock and its
nature; we did not expect any percolation of contaminants due to the behavior
described in point 5. However, to be absolutely sure, we have a monthly
sampling grid here and the composition of those samples is bound to increase
to the presence of contaminants.
As of this date, there have been no reports of leaks due to filtration and this
enables us to say that there is practically no possibility of filtration in
the future. We likewise do not expect any percolation due to the permeability
of the rock as we go toward the subsoil.
7. Effect of Uaste on Aniwal Life in Yanamate Lagoon
The species in Yanamate Lagoon do not correspond to unique species but rather
to a wide range of species common in the ecological nucleus; this is why the



-99-
effect of waste dumping in Yanamate can in no way threaten the extinction of any
species; nevertheless, the species will continue to exist in adjacent lagoons,
such as in the lagoons of Junin, Huascacocha, and Cunrun. It must of course be
understood that the fauna species in the lagoon will be wiped out due to the
effect of the impounding of contaminating waste.
8. Useful Life of Yanamate Lagoon-for Waste Dumping
To confirm the useful life of the Yanamate Basin as a receptacle of SX waste,
statistical on-ehe-spot checks will be performed for at least two precipitation-
drought cycles, in the following manner:
Rise in lagoon water level,
Rainfall,
Evaporation,
Temperature: Of water in Lagoon
Of environment,
Flow of waste.
The best estimates give us a useful life of 5 years which is why the information
will be in the nature of a confirmation.
V. BANK'S FUNCTION
The Bank's participation during the final design of the project as well as
during the configuration of the project's investment structure was quite signi-
ficant since it required the CkP to speed up the governmental administrative
processing for the purpose of obtaining supplementary foreign (BID) and local
(COFIDE) financing so that the project's execution could be launched as soon
as possible.
During project execution, it became necessary to reduce the project's original
scope, replacing the limestone and preparation and neutralization units with
a waste pumping line running from the plant to Yanamate Lagoon so as to eliminate
the pollution of the San Juan and Mantaro rivers. This modification had the
approval of the World Bank.
This institution furthermore participated in coordination meetings with the
project managers, a cooperative effort which signified support for the determina-
tion of administrative alternatives in project management; as a result of that,
there were deviations in the project which turned out to be contributing
factors in the project's investment costs.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON THE PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREPARED BY WORLD BANK OPERATIONS STAFF
I.        HIGHLIGHTS
The last two lines of para. 2 are subjective so we do not feel that
Para.2     their inclusion adds anything to a factual assessment of the project but is
Text       more likely, on the contrary, to prejudice recipients of the report against
amended. the project.
II.       PROJECT BACKGROUND
On the basis of a feasibility study prepared by R.M. Parsons in
1975, which calculated an optimum production scale of 7,000 tons of ore per
day and an investment of US$67.7 million excluding escalation and finance
charges, CENTROMIN and the World Bank prepared a report in May 1976 which
estimated that a higher return could be obtained by expanding production to
10,000 tons/day. A capital cost of US$160.9 million was considered for this
expansion, regarding which we felt there was a considerable degree of
uncertainty because no feasibility study for 10,000 tons/day had been made,
which led to a budget in which direct costs were US$71.9 million and
contingencies and escalation were estimated at US$50 million.
Owing to financial problems the project had to be suspended at the
end of 1977, after the Project Managers had completed the basic engineering.
Para. 8   and was subsequently reactivated in May 1979.  During the intervening period
major exploration work was carried out which showed there were no economically
producible reserves in the Pumagayoc area, so that the basic engineering
performed was no longer valid for execution of the project.
When the project was reactivated, the Project Managers were obliged
to substantially modify this basic engineering, especially as regards mine
Para.14   development and preparation and additional procurement of mining equipment,
Text      construction of a mine shaft, hydraulic fill and the Mantaro-Cobriza
amended. transmission line, and to include a new ore transportation system. estimating
a capital cost of the order of US$277 million, together with a new execution
schedule putting mechanical completion of the project in November 1982.



-103 -
It is important to note that this figure was the first realistic
estimate, since it was prepared after the final basic engineering for the
project which, in any event, remains valid at the estimated US$160.9 million
already referred to and included in the contract documents with the World bank
as the base budget for the project.
CENTROMIN has carried out various projects with foreign consultants,
always working in close collaboration with them, and has satisfactorily
completed execution of these projects: by way of examples, mention may be
made of the Zinc Plant Modernization Project, the Mine Water Treatment Plant
Project, the Lead Agglomeration Plant Project and the Interconnection Project,
all of which were satisfactorily completed as a result of the good work by the
foreign consultants.
Because of shortcomings of the Cobriza Project Management in certain
areas, especially the mining area, CENTROMIN had to perform directly the
planning of the mine working and calculation of the mining equipment, design
of the ore transportation system, design and construction of the hydraulic
fill system. supervision of the construction of the shaft, part of the
execution and supervision of the mine development works and services, thereby
reducing the scope of the work for which Project Management was responsible.
However, the fact that the project was completed six months ahead of the date
programed by the Management and at a cost of approximately US$44 million less
than the Management's estimate, indicates that coordination must have been
good, notwithstanding certain conflicts of interest between the two companies
as a result of the reduction in the scope of the services, a situation that
was not exceptional in a project of this size. It should be noted in this
respect that the World Bank staff members assigned to the project collaborated
actively toward improving, at certain times, the relations between CENTROMIN
and the Project Management which had deteriorated owing to the latter's
deficient performance of certain services in the areas mentioned.
III.      BANK STAFF CLARIFICATION REGARDING CENTROMIN'S PROJECT COMPLETION
REPORTS
Ore Reserves
During appraisal of the project in 1976, the proven and probable
reserves at Cobriza were estimated at 20 million tons of ore, with an average
Para.7    grade of 1.8% Cu and 5 oz silver per ton of ore, with an additional potential
of 90 million tons of ore, of which 30 million tons was thought to be located
at Cobriza and 60 million tons at Pumagayoc; however, it is important to note
that these reserves are geological; moreover, it must be borne in mind that
there are considerable losses during the mining process because pillars and
bridges have to be left for suppport, together with the dilution caused in the
blasting phase, especially in a bulk production system. These losses can be
of the order of 10-15Z, which appreciably reduces the proven and probable
reserves and their respective grades. Finally, because of its low percentage
of certainty, potential ore cannot in any event be considered in calculating
the economic life of a mine.



-104 -
The present grade being mined at Cobriza today is of the order of
1.3S Cu. This lower grade than that estimatd for the project is due primarily
to three factors: (i) part of the pillars and bridges of high-grade ore Cd
only be exploited toward the end of the life of the mine; (ii) between 1975
Para.8    and 1982 production was continued at a rate of 2,600 tons/day, with an average
grade of 2.2S Cu; (iii) the dilution inherent in the production method
presently used at Cobriza.
As already mentioned, it should be noted that during the period the
project was in suspension extensive exploration work was done which
Para.5    effectively ruled out the existence of sizable proven ore reserves at
Text      Pumagayoc, thus requiring modifications to the process and to the mining
appended. system in the final basic engineering.
Increase in Production Capacity
The alternative mentioned of expanding production by 20X would
require considerable expansions in the preparation and development of the mine
Para.10   and the mining equipment, an increase of the ore transport system, expansion
Footnote of the concentrate thickener, installation of additional flotation cells and
3/.       pumps, expansion of the primary crusher discharge system, modifications to the
conveyor system and dust collection systems and water supply, while the
shortening of the useful life of the mine to only 8.5 years in accordance with
the known present reserves would also have to be taken into account. All of
this makes it very difficult to consider expansion of production at this time,
especially in a situation as at present when copper prices are completely
depressed and there is no likelihood of any change in this situation in the
short or even medium term.
The only area at Cobriza that was studied during the locating of the
Para.ll   concentrator was the one known as "Plantanal," which is situated at the foot
Text      of the Miraflores area. The latter has a rather low safety factor, since it
amended. could be subject to slides in exceptionally heavy rains, so this alternative
was dropped. The Pampa de Coris is formed of similar materials in its tales,
but its slopes are much less steep and its base is broader in particular, so
that even if a slide were to occur any damage it might cause to the
installations would not be irreparable.
Consultants for Cobriza
In addition to what is stated in II, it should be noted that the
Para.13   Project Managers, in recognition of design errors and deficient supervision
Footnote for certain works, such as the tailings thickener, agreed to pay the full
4/.       compensation established pursuant to the contract, amounting to a sum of the
order of US$363,375 which represented 28.5X of the agreed fixed fee, following
negotiations of a most gentlemanly nature during which there was never at any
time any friction or interpersonal conflict.

Cost Adjustment of Cobriza Project
Regarding the adjustments of the capital cost of the Cobriza
Para.14   Project, we feel that the points discussed display a certain degree of
Text      subjectivity and wish to affirm that the figures given by CENTROMIN are the
appended  best estimate it can make and one which has not to date drawn any comments
and       from the external auditors who examine and report on our financial statements
amended.  from year to year.
Regarding the working capital assigned to the project, the Bank
Staff's report takes rais to be the sum equivalent to the additional operating
cost of the project for a period of two or three months.
This would apply in the case of a project that represented the
Para.15   entire operations of an enterprise, but loses validity when the sales of the
and       expanded plant only reprsent 10  of the enterprise's total sales, where some
Footnote  additional administrative rationalization measures could significantly reduce
5/.       the working capital requirements.  Moreover, it is known that all of Cobriza's
new concentrates production is intended to take the place of the bought-in
concentrates that have been used in our La Oroya Smelter, so the fact that
these concentrates no longer have to be purchased outside has reduced our
working capital requirements, rendering the incremental working capital needs
for Cobriza insignificant.
With regard to interest during construction, and coinciding with the
Bank's viewpoint, our final internal report on the completion of the Cobriza
Para.15   Project includes the finance charges up to December 1983 as interest during
and       construction.  As of the date of that report, December 1984, the total project
Table I.  cost can be summarized as:
Indirect costs                38,049.4
Direct costs                  150,596.6
Working capital                 1,638.4
Finance charges               42,700.0
US$232,988.3 million
We would point out that we are putting the final cost of the
Para.36.  Cobriza Project at US$7 million less than the figure reported a year earlier
Footnote in the Bank PCR and US$44 million less than the estimate made by the Project
10/.      Manager in 1979.

Mine Water Treatment Plant
The mine water treatment plant was intended basically to meet
CENTROMIN's obligation to stop polluting the Mantaro river, and this primary
objective has been accomplished.
Para.16
Text                 In cost terms, we used to only produce a copper "cement" with
amended.  60-70% Cu that was sent to La Oroya for final processing, whereas the present
plant produces refined copper of 99.9% Cu the cost of which is, of course,
Para.18   higher than for cementation; moreover, in view of the scale of the copper
Text      production the acidulated mine waters have to be viewed as a byproduct of the
appended. mining operation and the copper content of this water will depend on the
content in the materials mined, especially from the open-cut workings.
The main equipment, such as the transformers and rectifiers and
Para.18.  pumps, had problems from the start of operation, which considerably delayed
start-up. The purchase of equipment is the outcome of the international
competitive bidding required by the loan agreement which, to a certain
Para.18   degree, tends to hinder procurement of the most appropriate equipment since
Footnote  Lt is the bidder who meets the technical specifications and offers the lowest
7.        price who gets selected, as a result of which when start-up time comes the
equipment procured may not always prove to be the best suited.
Para.18              It must be emphasized that the project as originally designed
Footnote  envisaged a progressive manuaL reduction of 2% in production owing to a lower
6/.       copper content in the mine water.
CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
In general terms we are in agreement with the conclusions and
lessons as set forth in the Bank report. However, as we have noted in the
course of our comments, we do not consider it fair to bring in the following
points which, as we have demonstrated, are without validity:
(i)    Nonaccomplishment of the technical objectives of the Cobriza Project
Para.36              The Cobriza Project has met all its technical objectives, reaching
Text partially       design capacity in the fourth quarter of 1983.  Production is
amended.             currently 300,000 tons/month of an average grade of 1.33% Cu.
(ii)    Execution cost overrun
Para.36              It is important to bear in mind that the final cost of the project
Footnote             cannot be compared with the amount shown in the contract documents,
10/.                which is only of the order of US$160.9 million, since that figure
was arrived at without any feasibility study.  The final cost of
the project was US$232.9 million which, if compared with the final
estimate of US$277 million based on better knowledge of the
mineralized deposit by the Project Manager in 1979, represents a
saving of approximately 20%.



- 107 -
(iii)    Inadequacy of reserves
Para.9               As regards reserves, after having operated for more than three
Footnote             years as a project there are sufficient proven/probable reserves
2/.                  for ten years as a minimum, while there is also a significant
potential that would make it possible to continue operating for a
further five years.
We would also like to add the following suggestions for
consideration in future projects:
(i) Regarding the bidding and contract award process for critical
main equipment, we feel that greater weight should be assigned
to the quality of this equipment than to its cost.
(ii) To give greater certainty to the capital cost of a project,
and its return, the loans granted by the Bank, based on the
feasibility study, should be oriented toward development of
the basic engineering with some type of commitment that will
guarantee for the borrower Bank participation in the
subsequent execution of the project if the economic and
financial results of the basic engineering so warrant.
KEY PROJECT DATA
There is a sizable interval between the completion date of the
project and start-up of operations and the first year of operation.
This led to considerable variations in the total project cost and
the overrun on fixed assets, with the result that the rate of return on the
project was different from that expected.
Financial Covenants - Ratios
Regarding the financial covenants, our position is shown in a bad
Para.33   light in the projections in soles presented by the World bank, because the
Text       exchange rate used is not the real one but the end one, since our income is
appended  in dollars.  The distortion between the financial ratios in current soles and
and        in US dollars is due to the valuation of inventories in time of inflation
Footnote   (the selling price uses the average cost system) that is partially corrected
9/.        by the conversion into US$.



108 -
These projections are as follows:

In our opinion, the negative result observed in the Cobriza Project
is due to two decisive elements:
1.     The significant reduction in Cobriza's metal content and
Para. 38.                     reserves.  These two factors, regarding which there is
