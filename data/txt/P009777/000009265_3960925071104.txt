PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
MADHYA PRADESH AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROJECT
(PHASE III)
(CREDIT 1138-IN)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Madhya
Pradesh Agricultural Extension Project, Phase II, for which Credit 1138-
IN, in the amount of SDR 30.3 million (US$36.9 million) was approved on
April 23, 1981. The Credit was closed on June 30, 1989 after two one-
year extensions of Closing Date. The Credit was fully disbursed and
final disbursement was made on January 18, 1990.
The PCR was prepared by the Agriculture Operations Division 4
of the Asia Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary, and Parts I
and III), and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's final
supervision mission of the project in September 1989, and is based,
inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Development Credit
Agreement and Project Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda.

MADHYA PRADESH AtGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROJECT
(PHASE III)
(CREDIT 1138-IN)
EVALUtTION SUMMARY
O      binie
1.    The project sought to achieve early and sustained increases in
agricultural production in 33 project districts through the reorganization and
strengthening of the extension services of the Department of Agriculture
(DOA). The project aimed to achieve this reorganization over a five year
implementation period, to develop a professional, village-based, agricultural
extension service: capable of reaching all villages in the project area, with
the systematic provision of useful advice on farming practices, through
strictly programMed village visits, by regularly trained field staff, in
continuous contact with the research system.
Implementation Experience
2.    Implementation experience witnessed that project design and organization
was largely appropriate, although actual implementation was constrained by
fund availability and delayed by two years as a result. By Credit closure,
more than 90% of all extension positions were filled. Only the Agricultural
Extension Officer grade was seriously depleted with 30% vacancies. The c4:il
works program of 3,692 buildings was revised to 2,788; probably about 2,S-2
will be completed. This reduction, mainly in the number of staff houses, has
not affected project impact. Except for 24 jeeps (not procured), vehicle and
equipment procurement was satisfactory. Training implementation was
satisfactory except for the utilization of provisions for higher level
promotional training. With the two year extension of closing date the Credit
was fully disbursed, although on several occasions during implementation,
disbursements were temporarily suspended, due to delay in submission of audit
reports.
3.    The main risk identified at the time of appraisal, i.e., the transfer of
multipurpose field workers and the establishment of a single, unified
professional extension service with DOA, was successfully mitigated against
by project management and Bank supervision, which paid special attention to
this issue. As a result, a fully staffed, professional extension service was
established. A risk not fully appreciated, at the time of appraisal, was the
ability or commitment of GOMP to adequately fund the project. This issue was
exacerbated during the two-year implementation overlap between this and the
previous extension project in MP. Despite strong and continued follow-up by
supervision missions, GOMP did not remedy the bu"-7tary support issue for many
years.

Results
4.    The project has achieved the principal objective of establishing a
single line, unified, professional agricultural extension service in the
project districts. Linkages with the research system, structured visits to
farmers groups, sustained training of extension staff and technical guidance
by Subject Matter Specialists (SMS) enabled the establishment of a meaningful
agricultural extension service. Consequently, there have been encouraging
agricultural production gains and significantly increased use of farm inputs,
fertiliser and improved seed. There have also been significant changes in
cropping patterns in some areas, leading to an increase in cropping intensity.
5.    Yield increases significantly exceeded those estimated at appraisal as
necessary to obtain a 50% ERR, assuming those yield increases were due to the
project. Recalculation of an ERR with the actual cost stream, yields and
prices, on the same cropped area confirmed it to be in excess of 50%. No
attempt, however, has been made in the analysis to disaggregate the effect of
extension on production from other factors. Human resource development has
also been significant and resulted in 3,000 t:rained operational extensionists
in the State and a more technically informed body of farmers.
Sustainability
6.    The extension service established under the Project is now part of the
State's institutional framework, and recognized by the informed, as a powerful
communication force for information dissemination and agricultural change.
However, with ever-increasing salary scales, there is a risk that the state
may hesitate to continue funding such a large extension organization. There
is also a risk that pressures will build up to give increased non-extension
functions to extension staff, reverting back to the failed, multipurpose
Village Level Worker approach. These risks could be reduced by broad-basing
the extension approach and increasing accountability to local institutions.
Development of farmer paid field extension service also deserves serious
consideration.
Findings and Lessons Learned
7.    The main lessons learnt from implementation of this project include the
following:
Two extension projects should not be implemented in the same state
at the same time, as this restricts availability of budgetary
resources.
In most situations, the provision of staff housing is not
essential to the development and operation of an effective
extension service. Rented housing is readily available, cheaper,
and more flexible.
Target chasing in staff recruitment, and compromising on the basic
academic quality of staff should be avoided, even at the expense
of delayed implemertation. This is especially true in the case of
Subject Matter Specialists.



Stronger action could usefully be taken by the Bank/GOI (including
Credit suspension) in cases where states persistently fail to
provide adequate budgetary support for agreed project
implementation.
Improved management at district and regional levels should be
ensured by selecting district managers who possess management
skills and ability.

Proie.t Tdontitv

RVP Unit      : ASI
Country       : India
Sector        : Agriculture
Bakgroun*
2.    Government of India's developmental plans consistently assign
priority to increasing agricultural growth,   alleviating poverty and
creating employment in rural areas. Agriculture is the dominant sector
in the Indian economy; it engages 70% of the labor force and contributes
about 40% of the gross national product. Establishment of an efficient
extension service to promote faster spread of improved farm technologies
is one of the planks chosen by the national government for development
of agriculture and of the rural economy as a whole.
3.    Madhya Pradesh (MP) is India's largest state, covering an area of
44.3 million ha and has a population of about 52 million (1980).  The
population is predominantly rural (84%) and the agricultural sector
dominates the state's economy. Yields of most major food crops in Madhya
Pradesh are significantly below India's already low average.  Between
1970/71 and 1978/79, the production of foodgrains increased only at the
rate of 0.5% per annum whereas the average rate for India was 2.4% per
annum.   84% of the cultivable area in 1977/78  (net area sown 18.8
million ha) was single-cropped, either with one rainfed Kharif season
crop or with one Rabi crop grown on residual soil moisture following a
monsoon fallow.   Thus the productivity and cropping intensity of
agriculture in Madhya Pradesh was poor.
4.     In an attempt to overcome these deficiencies, and realising the
importance of transferring more productive technologies to the mass of
widely dispersed and small farmers, Madhya Pradesh became one of the
first states in India to introduce reorganized, professional (training
and visit [T&V]) extension services.  This was fully consistent with
Government of India's (GOI) policies. As a result, it received support
from the World Bank under the Madhya Pradesh Agricultural Extension and
Research Project (Credit 712-IN) which was appraised in October 1976,
became effective in September 1977 and was completed March 1983. This
project introduced T&V extension and strengthened research services in



15 of 45 districts in Madhya Pradesh. Background to, and performance of
this project are covered in its PCR (Report No. 6281 of June 25, 1986).
In summary the PCR stated "that significant achievements have been made,
and a sound extension structure, e-tablished in fifteen districts, to
which further improvements can be made".
5.    The results of this first phase project were, thus, sufficiently
encouraging for the Government of Madhya Pradesh (GOMP) to decide to
expand the coverage c- professional (T&V) agricultural extension
services to the entire state.   This was to be achieved through the
project currently under review, in this report.   A World Bank Credit of
SDR 30.3 M (US$37.OM) to the Government of India (GOI) became effective
on July 22, 1981 for on-financing to GOMP through the normal centre-
state financing arrangements, then pertaining.   Through this Credit,
professional extension services would be introduced into 30 more
districts (since increased to 33), on the same lines as was achieved
under Credit 712-IN in 15 districts of the state.
ProjeAt Ohje tlves and Description
6.    The project sought to achieve early and sustained increases in
agricultural production in 33 project districts through the
reorganization and strengthening of the extension services of the State
Directorate of Agriculture  (DOA).   The project would support this
reorganization over a five year period by:
a.            establishing a single line of command between full
time village extension workers (VEW) and extension
headquarters;
b.            consolidating staff from the special crop schemes
into a single unified service and strengthening the
linkage between agricultural research and extension;
c.            incorporating regular in-service training as an
integral part of extension activities;
d.            introducing a systematic fixed schedule for regular
and frequent visits by VEW to farmers' fields;
e.            strengthening of extension (VEW) training centres;
f.            developing  regular  monitoring  and  evaluation
procedures;
g.            strengthening arrangements for coordination of input
supplies and credit requirements; and
h.            providing  additional  staff,  operating expenses,
equipment, vehicles, training facilities, housing
and office buildings required to implement these
reforms.

7.    The total project cost was estimated at USS 60 Million.  Details
of cost are given in Table SA;   the main components are listed below:
a.            Incremental Staff Salaries: 43% of total base costs,
for extei3ion, training and monitoring and
evaluation staff.
b.            Civil works: 28% of total base costs, mainly for
field staff horsing bui; also for sub-divisicnal
officers and ste f training facilities.
c.            Vehicles and equipment: 9% of total base costs, to
mobilize and provide extension and training services
with basic office equipment and audio-visual aids.
d.            Training: 3% of total base costs, for basic and in-
service training of extension staff.
e.            Incremental other operating costs: 17% of total base
costs,  for  vehicle,  travel  and  miscellaneous
operating expenditures.
Proi-ect Desiagn and Organization
8.    The project was designed on a very well-tested logical conceptual
frame: a unified extension service; one village extension worker for
about 800 farm families; regular pre-sche'uled visits with specific
timely mes ages; close supervision and guidance by an agricultural
graduate extension orficer; support provided by field-based subject
matter specialists; and fortnightly, field-oriented training and monthly
workshops with the research system.   To operationalize the chosen
extension system, adequate funds were provided to establish a single
line o'F control with strong linkages with the research system, to train
staff regularly in latest technologies, and for housing, mobility and
teaching aids. GOI and GOMP clearly shared and understood the project
concept, aims and approaches.
9.    The project was thoroughly prepared by GOMP with assistance from
staff from the Bank's Resident Mission in India and in close
consultation with the GOI and the State Agricultural University
of,.icials. The roles and responsibilities, the linkages critical for
e.ccess and methods of field operation were clearly articulated,
discussed and finalised.
10.   Whilst the timing of the project was quite logical, its first two
years of execution overlapped with the last two years of the previous
Extension and Research Project  (Credit 712-IN).   As GOMP was either
unable to provide full budgetary requirements of both projects at the
same time, the subject project was left very short of funds in the early
years, seriously delaying implementation.
11.   In retrospect, one could vouchsafe that the project design and
organization was largely appropriate, although, as noted above, its
overlap with a previous extension project constrained fund availability



-4-
and severely delayed execution by two years.   As a result of the
project's design and organization, the technology delivery capability of
the DOA has vastly improved through establishment of a professional
extension service with a sound structure, training and mobility, with
appropriate linkages with the research system and a closer contact with
the farmers.   In an anxiety to establish a unified professional
agricultural extension service quickly, compromises have been made on
the quality of Subject Matter Specialists (SMSs) engaged and in the
quality  of pre-service  training  of village extension.    This has
adversely affected the project implementation, particularly in its
earlier years. Measures to redress this deficiency have been introduced
through refresher, in-service training.
Proiect Implementation
12.   Implementation of physical components was substantially delayed
because of poor budgetary support by GOMP. This affected all components
in the early years of implementation. By 1986, however, most staff were
in position.    Because  of delays  the  civil  works  component  was
substantially reduced at the time of the Mid-Term Review.   However,
though delayed, the project eventually succeeded in establishing a fully
staffed, adequately accommodated and mostly mobile service, which is
functioning well in most districts.   It is worth noting that the
presence of staff housing and a large civil works program has not proved
essential to the establishmaent of effective extension, (rental quarters
are available almost everywhere).   Indeed, such a large civil works
component, whilst boosting project costs and total disbursement,
involved great administrative problems for extension managers and tended
to divert their attention from more critical tasks. Sub-divisional
office and training facilities have, however, proved extremely useful.
13.   By Credit closure, more than 90% of all extension positions were
filled, one half of which were new recruits. The Agricultural Extension
Officer grade was severely depleted with 30% vacancies. Only 55% of the
intended farm input coordination staff positions were filled, but this
service was apparently able to function effectively.   The civil works
program of 3,692 buildings was revised to 2,788; probably about 2,312
will be completed.   This reduction, mainly in the number of staff
houses, has not affected project impact.   Except for 24 jeeps  (not
procured), vehicle and equipment procurement, though delayed, was
satisfactory.  Training implementation was satisfactory e::cept for the
utilization of provisions for higher level promotional training of
village extension workers (VEW), Agricultural Extension Officers (AEO)
and Subject Matter Specialists  (SMS).   Regrettably,  this training
provision was poorly used.
14.   With an extension of closing date by two years,  total Rupee
expenditure increased to Rs.694 million against an SAR estimate of
Rs.480  million.       Rupee  expenditure  on  incremental  salaries
substantially exceeded estimates because of pay scale revision and the
extra years of implementation, civil works expenditure was more or less
as estimated, and expenditure on training, vehicles and equipment and
operating costs, significantly below SAR estimates. The Credit was fully
disbursed.  On several occasions during implementation, disbursements



-5-
were temporarily suspended, due to delay in submission of audit reports.
Estimated and Actual Expenditure (Rs.M)

Incremental Staff      208.00       464.19
Civil Works            133.00       150.08
Equipment & Vehicles    40.00        22.05
Training                15.00         9.35
Operational Costs       84.00        48.83
Total            480.00       694.50
15.             At the time of appraisal, the transfer of multipurpose
field workers and the establishment of a single, unified professional
extension service, was considered to be a major risk, as this marked a
significant departure from past practice in India.   This risk was
successfully mitigated against by project management and Bank
supervision, which paid special attention to this issue. As a result, a
fully staffed, professonal extension service was established, having a
conspicuous impact on technology transfer and production.  A risk not
fully appreciated, at the time of appraisal, was the ability or
commitment of GOMP to adequately fund the project.   Furthermore,  in
hindsight, it would probably have been better not to have started this
second phase project until the first phase was fully completed. Despite
strong, and continued follow-up by supervision missions, GOMP was not
able to remedy the budgetary support issue for several years, due to
state-wide issue of budgetary stringency.
Project Results
16.               The project has achieved the principal objective of
establishing a single line, unified, professional agricultural extension
service in the project districts.   Linkages with research system,
structured visits to farmers groups, sustained training of extension
staff and technical guidance by Subject Matter Specialists enabled the
establishment of a meaningful agricultural extension service.
Consequently, there have been encouraging agricultural production gains
and significantly increased use of farm inputs, fertiliser and improved
seed (Table 6, page 1).  There have also been significant changes in
cropping patterns.   The increase in area planted to soyabean and the
consequent reduction in Kharif fallows in black soil regions of the
state is seen as a significant achievement under the project.   The
soyabean area has gone up from 0.3 million ha in 1981-82 to 1.3 million
ha in 1987-88. The introduction of the short duration pigeon pea and a
mixed cropping of long duration pigeon pea with soyabean in the Kharif
season are other important achievements. The increase in Kharif cropped
area, though modest, is a significant breakthrough in black soil areas
which otherwise, were left fallow.   The data on Kharif land use from
1981-82 to 1985-86 collected from Directorate of Economics and
Statistics, Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India is presented
below:

Year              Area in Million Hectares
1981-82                    12.85
1982-83                    12.87
1983-84                    13.09
1984-85                    13.15
1985-86                    13.23
Kharif crop intensity in 1985-86 has increased by 3% over 1981-82. The
trend is continuing and accelerating and the overall cropping intensity
increasing.
17.   Apart from physical achievements under the project, qualitative
improvements such as upgrading technical competence of staff,
establishing a working pattern of technology transfer and bringing
extension and research organizations closer together represent a strong
foundation for future improvement and development of the agricultural
sector as a whole.
18.    Attributing a precise level of benefit to an extension project is
difficult as it is just one of several factors contributing to increase
in productivity and cropping intensity.   The Staff Appraisal Report
noted that a rate of return of 50% would be obtainable, providing
certain assumed crop yield increases were obtained. Recalculating the
internal rate of return using the actual and extended cost stream,
actual yield increases and current economic prices confirms that an
internal rate of return of over 50% was obtained; with the actual yield
increases exceeding assumptions of the Staff Appraisal Report.   No
attempt has been made to disaggregate the effect of extension from other
factors in the analyses. Comparison of three-year yield averages, pre-
project and for the last three years of the project, show increases in
the productivity of rice and wheat of 272 Kgs and 326 Kgs per ha,
respectively.
19.   There is no doubt that the project has had a very significant
impact in providing village-based professional agricultural advisory
services to most, if not all, villages in the 33 project districts. A
service has been developed, appreciated and used by farmers.   Human
resource development has also been considerable, resulting in 3,000
trained operational extensionists in the State. Developmental changes
are most prominent in irrigated farming situations and in the high
moisture-retention,  black soil,  rainfed areas.   Horticulture,  tree
farming, fodder development and natural resources conservation,
inclusive of soil moisture conservation, have not received adequate
attention. Planning and management of agricultural programs are yet to
attain a desirable professional standard.
Project Sustainability
20.   The extension service established under the Project is now part of
the State's institutional framework, and recognized by the informed, as
a powerful communication force for information dissemination and



agricultural change. To consolidate the project gains and improve upon
them, timely and adequate budgetary support, particularly for operating
costs and vehicle replacement, is critical.  Further, attention also
needs to be given to continuous human resource development; the broad
basing of extension with the aims of cost effectiveness and the
provision of an integrated service to the farmers.   High quality
research support, close coordination with other support systems, and the
introduction of improved planning and management methods are also
important.   Above all, continued firm commitment by GOMP to provide
extension service through a single line agency is vital. GOMP has said
that they are impressed by the impact of single line professional
extension approach and that they intend to maintain it as such.
21.   The present extension approach is relatively staff-intensive.
With ever-increasing salary scales, there is a risk that the state may
hesitate to continue funding a large extension organization. This risk
could be mitigated against by conscious and visible efforts to make
extension cost effective by the assignment of all land-based agriculture-
related extension  activities;    increasing the  accountability  of
extension _.o local bodies without losing direct administrative control,
and by exploring ways of establishing a farmer-paid field extension
service, at least on a pilot scale.
Bank Performanco
22.  The Bank has assisted  GOI/GOMP to establish a reformed extension
service, critical for rapid development of agriculture, which is a
national priority. The performance of the Bank has been satisfactory.
The project preparation and appraisal have been completed within a
reasonable time frame with substantial support from the New Delhi
Office.  Supervision missions have assisted the project management to
improve its performance and consistently focussed attention on key
implementation issues.  The intensity of supervision in the first two
years appears low, however, with only 7 manweeks spent in the field.
Further, the first field mission took place one year after the
declaration of effectiveness. Given the start-up problems faced by the
project, it is surprising that more intensive supervision was not
accorded the project at this critical time. However, Bank supervision
missions on the previous project were dealing with many of the same
institutions up to FY85. Subsequently, missions have been regular, at
least two per year.

23.   In  retrospect,  a  number  of  lessons  do  emerge  from  the
implementation experience of this pruject:
a)    Two extension projects should not be allowed to overlap in the
same state.  This puts too much pressure on available budgetary
resources.   (NB:  Unfortunately,   the same problem has occured
with this project overlapping ,with National Agricultural Extension
Project (NAEP) I in Madhya Pradesh, and with the same effect on
the budgetary support for NAEP I.)



- 8 -
b)    In most situations,  the provision of staff quarters is not
essential to the development and operation of an effective
extension service. Rented housing is readily available, cheaper,
and more flexible.
c)    Target chasing in staff recruitment, and compromising on the basic
academic quality of staff should be avoided, even at the expense
of delayed implementation. This is especially true in the case of
Subject Matter Specialists.
d)    Stronger action could usefully be taken by the Bank/GOl (including
Credit suspension) in cases where states persistently fail to
provide adequate budgetary support for agreed project
implementation.
e)    A clear understanding should be reached with the Accountant
General (based at Gwalior not Bhopal) on Bank requirements, and on
the need for timely preparation and submission of audited accounts
and certificates of expenditure on statements of expenditure.
Borrower Performance
24.   GOI and the executing agency, GOMP,  genuinely participated in the
preparation and appraisal of the project.   Participation of the
Department of Agriculture was intense. Unfortunately, the commitments
made were not strictly adhered to, in respect of providing adequate
budgetary support, in timely recruitment of staff, in construction of
buildings,  and in procurement of vehicles.   These led to project
objectives being achieved two years late.   The failure to release
adequate funds was probably a result of several factors; a genuine lack
of resources in the State because of recurrent drought conditions, and
because higher priority was given to scarcity relief and State
counterpart funding of centrally sponsored schemes in the allocation of
the scarce financial resources. Also, budgeted funds were frequently not
actually released until late in the fiscal year, contributing to
implementation slippage.  During implementation, the project was also
affected by various State-wide bans on vehicle purchase, training, etc.,
all of which served to frustrate implementation to a greater or lesser
extent.
25.   Given this general  scenario,  the Department  of Agriculture
performed reasonably well in its execution of the project. Throughout
implementation, the project was rated '2' by supervision missions, with
persistent problems being management and financial. Whilst the project
has always been headed by competent senior staff at State headquarters,
too frequent transfers and changes in personnel has led to discontinuity
of management.   Performance of village level staff has always been
encouraging, but performance of SMS and district managers mixed.
Lessons of experience that would be relevant in the preparation of
future agricultural projects include:
-     the full commitment of the Department of Finance to the proje t
should be ensured from the outset;



-     audit reporting requirements should be very clearly established
with the Office of the Accountant General;
-     improved management at district and regional levels should be
ensured by selection of staff with management skills and ability;
and
-     the Borrower, GOI, should monitor and follow up more intensively,
persistent cases of slow disbursement and inadequate State
budgetary support.
Project Relationshio1
26.   Bank relationship with C-OI/GOMP has been good throughout the
project implementation period and continues to be so.   Supervision
missions have interacted primarily with the Department of Agriculture.
More direct contact with the Department of Finance and the Office of the
Accountant General could have been beneficial in resolving the financial
issues earlier.
Consultina servics
27.   There was no special provision for consultancy services under the
project. Implementation assistance was provided by GOI's Department of
Extentions and, to a limited extent, by Bank staff.
Proect Documentation and Data
28.   The legal agreements for this project were quite adequate for
achieving project objectives. Staff Appraisal Report provided a useful
frame work for the Bank as well as GOI/ GOMP for project implementation
and review.  M&E reports helped in critically evaluating the project
results and build a better data base.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1.    Factual information contained in Part III of the PCR has been
confirmed and amended wherever necessary.
2.    Borrower's comments on Part I were incorporated in this final
version of the PCR.
Project and Bank Performance
3.    Project design and preparation has been appropriate, adequate
supervision along with mid-term appraisals have yielded beneficial
results. As a result, almost two-thirds of the State was brought under
the T&V system with the Bank's assistance durir": this Phase-II Project.
The entire state is now covered by a reformed single-line extension
professional service.
4.    The following observations regarding Bank's performance deserve
mention:
rates of reimbursement should have been fixed at 100% for
all items such as buildings, vehicles, equipment and
furniture as in the case of training;
full reimbursement for both incremental technical and non-
technical staff engaged in extension should have been
allowed;
a separate head of account for extension is in vogue, hence
the entire expenditure rooked under this head every month
should be reimbursable and since it is based on actual
withdrawals, no certificate from the Auditor General should
be insisted upon;
it is admitted that full budgetary provisions either could
not be made or if made, were subjected to cuts under
compelling financial constraints. The reason may be mainly
attributed to recurrent droughts and consequent diversion of
funds. Secondly, due to the starting of this project (Phase-
II) concurrently with the implementation of Phase-I, the
usual annual provision needed abnormal augmentation which
could not be met in full. It is, however, not correct to
assume that the project was not assigned priority it
deserved or that efforts were not made to obtain appropriate
allocations. These unforeseen bottlenecks as narrated
above, necessitated extension of the project implementation
period by two years and the entire Credit now stands fully
disbursed.



- 12 -
The State made sincere efforts towards recruitment of
village level workers and with a view to putting them on the
job as early as possible, the pre-service training period
was reduced and bare essential training was given. This has
to be followed by in-service training now, and the state is
now planning in this direction. As regards SMS, paucity of
trained technical personnel in the state was the main cause
for the delay in filling of posts. The state has made
recruitment, and promotions within the framework of
recruitment rules, and the entire staff available has been
put on the job. Although SMS of the stipulated disciplines
are not available everywhere, the state now is planning to
impart training to SMS in the desired discipline and is
arranging short courses.
Relationship between the Bank and the state has been cordial
during the implementation of the project; mutual
understanding and sincere efforts have led to the success of
the project and fulfillment of the stipulated goals to a
large extent.

the extension period) there were climatically three bad years 82-83, 86-
87 and 87-88. In spite of this and the fact that rainfed agriculture
dominates in the State, the yield levels of important crops have
registered a general increase, with less fluctuation between good and

significantly exceed those estimated at appraisal as being necessary to
obtain a 50% ERR if such yield increases could be attributed to the
project.

Table 6.A.1 indicates that the required yields were exceeded.  In
addition, recalculation of ERR, at extended cost stream, new prices, actual
yields and with same cropped area confirmed an ERR in excess of 50%.
C. Financial Impact
Not applicable.
D.  Studies
No specific studies were planned.
4 No attempt was made to disaggregate the effect of extension from other factors
affecing increase in yields.
