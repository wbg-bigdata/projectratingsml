IPPRAISAL OF PUBLIC UTILITIES AUTHORITY POWER EXPANSION PROJECT
Suii¶iARLY
i.        This report appraises an urgently needed project to enable the
rublic Utilities Authority (PUA) to meet the rapidly growing demand for
power in Monrovia. The Government, on behalf of PUA, has requested a Bank
loan of US$7.4 million to finance the off-shore costs of the expansion
of the Mt. Coffee hydro-electric plant by installation of a third 17 14W
unit and the installation of a third and fourth 15 MW gas turbine unit at
Bushrod.
ii.       PUA serves the residential, commercial and small industrial
demand in Monrovia area.   This power market has grown over the past few
years at about 21% annually, reaching 34 MW and 188 GWh by the end of
1968.. It is estimated that a 17% average growth rate (including new
industrial loads) will be achieved over the next five years, reaching a
demand of 130 MW and 474 GWh by the end of 1974. The project would help
meet PJA's requiremients until that time after which new genurating facili-
ties would be needed.
iii.      Addition of the three units proposed for Bank financing, plus
the Nlo. 2 gas turbine unit already on order for Bushrod, would increase
the Itnrovia systerm's installed capacity from the present 66 MN to 124 IV
and the firm capacity in the dry season from 21.0 MW to 71.0 14W.
iv.      'The cost of all the new power facilities to be constructed
during the 1970-1974 expansion program, of which the project forms a
part. is estimated to total US$21.h million. Of that amount. the works
proposed for Bank financing are estimated to cost US$9.7 million; of wh:Lch
US$7.4 million reDresents the off-shore costs to be covered by the Bank
loan, and UJS$2.3 million the local costs.
v.        The Borrower would be PUA.   Created in 1962 as an autonomous
statutorv corporation to provide electrical services it now also has re.pon-
sibility for water supply and for establishing a sewerage system in Monrovia,
Tn 1963  PUTA signed a contracnt with  'nde-ro-n b PoHrte-r  Tnrc  (.P.) of New
York for management and operational services.   The S&P Management Team in
Monrovia mrnPnt1y has QvPn members, all of whom serve in key poxsitions.
Although generally satisfactory, the management of PUA could be improved.
For day-to-day operations, there is too m-ch reliance orn expate personnel
even though there are Liberians with excellent qualifications on the staff.
A vrnnv,v, ann .e.1v r-ef  agreed to rd-.o  Ey the p 4resnt --- 4or.at-4in4 l struvre

forecast to increase to 8.2% by 1974.  For power operations alone, the
raate of return decreased to 54e in 1969, but is foreuast to u ciase to
11% by 1974, which is satisfactory. A minimum return of 10% has been

viii.     Of the Power Department's five-year financing requirements, wihich
totals US$22.0 million including increase in working capital, 70% or
uS$15.3 million is expected to be financed by borrowTings (including the pro-
posed Bank loan) and the remaining 30% or US$6.7 million by internel sources.
ix.       PUA's overall long-term debt amounts to 77% of capitalization;
however, the debt/equity ratio is expected to improve to 67/33 by 1974.
The power department's ratio is expected to improve to 65/35 by 1974.
x.        The proposed expansion program represents the least-cost means
of meeting the demand for power in the NIonrovia system. The incremental
financial rate of return on the proposed development is 20%.
xi.       The project proposed for Bank financing is suitable for a loan
of US$7.4 million equivalent for a term of 20 years, including a grace
period of five years.

1.01      I'he Government of Liberia, on behalf of the Public Utilities
.Mt&L VALd..Y (JA)Vti, a4J autonom,Jous staatut %ALI-Ay uU.LJPoatio  esQabLJ±U11  L in
June 1962, has requested a Bank loan of US$7.4 million equivalent to help
fi-nance the exp-nsion of the ,t. Coffee hyuuo-electric plant by the
addition of a third 17 MW unit and the procurement and installation of
twvo L5 MvWT gas burbines at Bushrod (rMonrovia) . The addition of these
units, together with a 15 MW gas turbine unit already on order, would
increase the 1vonrovia system's present installed capacity Of 66 RNJ to
124 MAiU (see paragraph 2.08) and its firm capacity from 21.0 MW to 71 MW.
This would be the first Bank loan to PUA.
1.02      The estimated cost of all new power facilities to be constructed
by PUA during 1970-1974 is US$21.4 million, of which the proposed Bank-
financed project would account for US$9.7 million.  Of this amount, US$2.3
million would represent the local costs and the US$7.4 million Bank loan
the off-shore costs. Liberia utilizes US currency.
1.03      PUA serves 1bnrovia's residential, commercial and small industrial
power demand, which in recent years has grown at an average of 21% per year,
reaching 34 14W and 188 GWh by the end of 1968. It is estimated that an
average growth rate of 17%, including new contracted industrial loads, will
raise demand to 80 MvW and 474 GWh by the end of 1974. The proposed project
would meet peak requirements until that time. New generating facilities
will then need to be commissioned.
1.04      The Government first approached the Bank for financial assistance
in September 1968. A USAID-financed study by Chas. T. Main International,
Inc. of Boston, on ]iberia's electric power development was underway at
that time, with completion scheduled for May 1969. But the report was
delayed because of the need to expand the study to investigate the possi-
bility of upstream storage for the existing Mt. Coffee hvdro-electric plant.
Since the result of this investigation could significantly affect the se:Lec-
tion of a construction program, the project appraisal was postponed unti:L
completion of the study. The consultants' final report was received at
the erld of August 1969; it was reviewed in the Bank and an appraisal mission
visited Liberia in early November.
1.05      This report was prepared by E. A. M1nnig (Power Engineer) and
A. N. Memn (Financial   alyst) who manti t.he fieldal qrniq1 in ibp-ria
in November 1969.



2. THE PU3MI SECTOR
A. IThe Economy
2.01      The Republic of Liberia, constituted in 1847, lies at the south-
w.tesrn -xrtrPnity of the western nn1ge of the African cnntinent.  Tt. m-ea iq
approximately 43,0(0 sq miles, and the coastline extends for some 370 miles.
2.02      Of Liberia's total estimated population of 1.14 million (1969),
about 910,000 live in the coI. tryside and 230,0no ir th-e urban areas.  I4uch
of the popuilation is concentrated in the Monrovia and Harbel areas and along
the principal hghy -          ,-,e--.  v^i+itGba C,ga,,3 ar.d S,-4 uell

areas.
2.03      Liberia iis a major rubber producer. Total production is expected
to reach 1L.2 iallior p ounda in 1970, compared witnh 94.5 mul"ion pounds .n
1960. Other agricultural export commodities are coffee, cocoa and palm
products.  Iron ore mining nas become the leading industry and in 1yo  atc-
counted for 26% of GDP and 72% of exports. The total value of iron ore
exports in 1968 is estimated at US$120 million.
2.o4~     In 1967, GDP was US$330 million0 (at current prices), having in-
creased on average 6% per annum since 1960. The GNP in 1967 was US$218 per
capita. Future GD]? growth will probably be slower than in the past, aver-
aging 4.5% per year up to 1975.  The growth of iron ore production will slow
down now that the rmines are working close to capacity, although a new mine
in the Vlologisi area is currently under investigation by the Liberian Iron
and Steel Corporation (LISCO).  Rubber production will probably grow
at about 5,i per year up to 1975 as newz and replanted acreage reaches matu-
rity. The growth of medium-size agricultural and manufacturing activities
is promising. Apart from mining and agriculture, Liberia's economic activity
is concentrated in Monrovia, Harbel and Buchanan -- the area served by l'UA's
Monrovia power system.
B. Existing Pbwer Facilities
2.05      PUA generates about 35% of the country's total power consumption
(690 GWh in 1969).  Industrial producers -- maiLnly the iron ore companies --
produice the remainiLng 65%. This ratio has not changaed since 1966. To serve
its Mlonrovia system demand, PUA presently has installed 66 MW of generating
eauirment. of which 34 MW are hv&ro (Mt. Coffee) and 32 MW thermal.  PUA also
operates six secondary centers as an agent of and with funds provided by the
GovPrnmmPnt! dliesel ennrAnif inqtqllped in t.hesep e-enters tot-als, ab-nlt, 3.5 MW.
2.06      Whern the ,mining companes started operntions, PTTA servd onlv
Monrovia and was in no position to supply their power and energy require-
ments as the mirning concessions were in reamote areas.  As a consequence, the



- 3 -
companies installed their own equipment and later were reluctant to depend
on a power supply not within their control.   However, both the Bong MinLng
Co. (BMC) and Liberian Mining Co. (LMC), which are closer to Mbnrovia than
the other companies (see map attached to this report), signed a contract
with PUA in 1969 for the supDly of firm enerav.   The necessary transmis,sion
facilities are already in operation. Distances are too great to justify an
intercornection to supDply the other companies at present.

A second 1$5 Tl gas turbine presently on order and scheduled for commissioninE
early in 1970 will be installed at Bushrod and will permit the retirement of
diesel generators installed at Krutown.
2.09      This capacity is inadequate to meet system demand because in the
dry season, Mt. Coffee has a capacity of only 8 MW. Firm capacity in 1969
totalled only 25 Ml to meet a demand of 36 W. By early 1970, the deficit
will have growm to 21 MW.
2.10      The Mt. Coffee hydro-electric scheme, located on the St. Paiul
River 15 miles northeast of Mlonrovia was conmissioned in 1967, with twro
generating units and an ultimate capacity for six. It was an expensive
project reqluiring an investment of about US$29.1 million or US$855/Al-
ins'tlled, which i,s a very high fibure, but its full utilization depended
on the construction of upstream wiater storage facilities to augment the
flows of the St. Paul River during each year's dry season. Investigations
1/ Bishrod and Krutown are suburbs of Monrovia.

in  yuu/u69 showeu uncLu usie uistalautionL uo gas Laruines was a less expeinsi-v
means of f:irming the dry season capacity of the Mt. Coffee plant than the
prov'ision oIf upstream storage.  In early 1969 ruA installed a 15 riw gas
turbine and ordered a second identical uinit for commissioning in early :L970,
for this pirpose. The further development of this high initial cost instal-
lation is now justified only because the cost of the additional combine(d
nydro/gas turbine units required for its extension is low, being about
US$320AW. The Mt., Coffee project is more fully described in Annex 1.
2.11      With the exception of a reinforced concrete spillway structure,
the clams creating the headrace pond are earth embankments up to 75 ft high.
During negotiations assurances were obtained that PUA by December 31, 1970
would subiLt for Bank approval a program for the periodic inspection of the
dams, waterways, earthworks and reservoir embankments at Mt. Coffee in order
to determine whether there are any deficiencies or potential deficiencies in
the condition of such structures and earthworks or in the quality and
adequancy of maintenance or methods of operation which may endanger public
safety.
Secondary Centers
2.12      PDUA also serves six secondary centers with small separate faci.li-
ties: Harper (population 39,000), Greenville (5,200), Sanniquellie (96,)00),
Gbarnga (78,000). l'chien (10,000). and Robertsport (6,000). These centers
are mainly county or district administrative headquarters. Installed ca.-
pacity at all the centers totals about 3.5 MW, about 2.0 MT of which are
installed at Gbarnga.

though decelerating growth in the powver market are:
(i)  in 1969 PUA signed contracts with IC and BYC to supply
powJer on a firm full ;year basis.  These con Lracu u ruquii-E:
PUhL to provide 9 14W and 45 GWh in 1969, rising to 18 M4W
and 99 G0Th in 1972 and thereafter;
(ii)  residential and commercial sales are estimated to nave
increased in the past at an average rate of 18%o per year
ancl sales to the Government at 9.01% per year. PuA's
Consultants have estimated that residential and com-
mercial sales up to 1974 would grow at an annual rate
of 17%, slightly below the previous rate, and that sales
to the Government would decline to an average annual
rate of 3.5% due to a decline in construction of govern-
merit buildings, which had been substantial in the past.
These estimates are reasonable.
2.16      The actual and forecast generation, maximum demaiid, sales and
revenues for the probable load forecast up to 1974 are shown in detail in
Annex 2. Estimates of sales and revenuesAcWh are crude because there are no
current data on sales by tariff classification.  The estimates have been
based on the only classification available, a six-month analysis for January-
June 1965 which indicated that residential, commercial and small industrial
sales accounted for 65% of total generation. sales to the Government and the
Commonwealth of Monrovia for 12%, andi losses for 20%; station use was about
3%. PUA has agreed to compile data to be submitted to the Bank in periodic

(i) Expansion of Xt. Coff.ee and provision of upstream
storage to firm up St. Coffee;
(ii)  diesel expansion;
(iii)  steam. thermal plant;
(iv) further additions of gas turbines;
(v)  expansion of Mt. Coffee as a run-of-the-river plant
with diesel units added to firm up Mt. Coffee;
(vi)  same as (v) but steam units added to firm up Mt. Coffee;
and
(vii)  same as (v) but gas turbines added to firm up Mt. Coffee.
2.19      Alternative (i) including upstream storage wzas discarded as
uneconomic under all conditions. The Consultants' analysis of alternatives
(ii) and (v) which include diesel generating equipment showed these to be
the least attractLve when compared with gas turbines or steam and were thus
also discarded. (Qf the remaining four alternatives, the Mt. Coffee plus
gas turbine alternative No. (vii) was found to be the one best adapted to
meet; forecast demnrd. In this alternative, gas turbines with their low
capital costs and high running costs, are combined with the Mt. Coffee hydl-
plant in order to make up for anv deficiencv in hvdro outpput for a short
period in the annual dry seasons.  The cost of the combined hydro/gas turbine
unit arwiunts to onlv about US$32O per ki installed which is within the rangre
usually considered economic for hydro-electric development alone.

maretl and sche-mes that may be developed. rPUA nas agreeu to up-aue i-
review by not later than early 1973 its expansion plans beyond. 1977.
2.22      PUA will also have to improve distribution facilities in M5onrovia
during this perioci. Substations are operating at design capacity. To
prevent an increahse in distribution losses and to maintain reasonable
reliability, the networks need strengthening. PFuA has engaged its engineer-
ing consuLtants to carry out a distribution study; its terms of reference
nave been approved by the Bank and the off-shore, costs of the study are
included Ln the proposed loan.
2.23      This study should be completed and the Consultants' report avTailable
by September 1970, showing distribution requirements to meet forecast demanld
for 1971-L981. The report would form the basis of a distributior project

Secondary Centers
l at      -Wt *s Costns-e           oitc
2.24      ru. s Consultants Lave submitted proposais for the electrification
of four new areas; Kpetu (population 52,000), Tapeta (20,000), Zorzor (23,000),
and Voinjama (52,000).   Tne Consultants have concluded, reasonably, that up
to at least 1981 the most economic solution would consist of diesel generation
at each center rather than centralized generation or transmission from
Mbnrovia. Investments during 1970-1975 for generation and distribution in
these new centers and at the existing centers are estimated at US$5.4 mil-
lion. The details of potential demand to be served and investment require-
ments to meet it are shown in Annex 5.
2.25      PUA serves the secondary centers as an agent of and with funds
provided by the Government and therefore, investments for the expansion of
the centers or the establishment of new ones are not included in PUA's in-
vestment program. To prevent PUA from being overburdened financially or
admilistratively, assurances were obtained from the Government during nsgo-
tiations that:
(a)  it will continue to follow its present policy of providing
all the funds needed for secondary centers' expansion
and for subsidizing their operating losses.   (Separate
accounts are kept for each center and the Government re-
imburses PIJA for any operating losses through a clearing
account); and
(b)  it will not require PRL to operate or establish any such
additional centers unless the nronosed additions will not
adversely affect the efficiency of the Monrovia system.



3. TBE IROJECT
3.01      The project, which would me!et P-UA's generation requirements
through 1974 would consist of:
(i) Expansion of the Mt. Coffee hydro-electric plant to
include :
(a)  civil works associated with and installation
of the third 17 MW turbine-generator unit;
(b)  civil works only for the fourth 17 MW turbine-
generator unit - to be installed in 1975;
(c)  excavation only for the fifth 17 MW turbine-
generator unit - to be installed in 1977;
(d)  15-miles, of 69-kV transmission line from Mt. Coffee
to Bushrod, including terminal facilities;
(ii) two 15 MW gas turbines to firm up Mt. Coffee power; and
(iii)  consulting services for Mt. Coffee expansion and for a
distribution study to 'be carried out by September 1970.

A contingency allowance of 5% is allowed for the gas turbines and 101o for
Mt. Coffee expansion. These contingency allowances are relatively low
because, in the case of the gas turbines, their costs are based on 1969
contract figures for units 1 and 2 already installed or on order; in the
case of Mt. Coffee expansion, conditions are known, no construction diffi-
culties are anticipated, and the quantities are based on the actual
quantities that were needed for units 1 and 2. In the event the con-
tingency allowances are not needed or there are other savings, any surplus
funds would be cancelled.

Consultants and Status of Engin_ E  eri
3.03      The plans and design for the Mt. Coffee expansion are available,
but tender docurmenits anrd specificat-ions have not yet been prepared.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that PUA will engage the
services of qualified consultants for design review and preparation of
tender documents and specifications. With the assistance of Sanderson and
Porter, Inc. (S&P) (its consultants) and the manufacturer, PUA:s staff is
capable of instal:Ling and comnmissioning the gas turbine units.  The staff
is also capable of designing and erecting the 69-kV transmission line :From
Mt. Coffee to Bushrod. PUA also has engaged the services of Chas. T. M4ain
for the distribut:ion study to be completed by September 1970 (paragraph 2.22).
Procurement and Disbursement
3.0o4     Procurernent would be on the basis of international competitive
bidding in accordanzce with the Bank's guidelines.  Disbursements would be
made for the CIF cost of equipment and material imported for the project
and the off-shore costs of consulting and erection services as specified in
the contriact.
Construction Schedule
3.05      The construction schedule, which is reasonable, foresees the
cormriissioning of gas turbine unit No. 3 in Mvarch 1971 and No. 4 in March
1972. Mt. Coffee unit No. 3 would be in service in Mlarch 1973.

4.  JUSTIFICATION OF TXIE PROGRAM
4.01      EUAIs load growth is expected to approximate 17% per annum over the
next few years (paragraphs 2.14-2.15). Failure to meet this load would seri-
ously inhibit the industrial and commercial development which the mining boom
initiated and which is expected to continue at a rapid rate.   As has already
been indicated, PUAl has no alternative but to install additional gas turbine
units in 11971 and 1972 to meet immediate requirements. For PUA's development
beyond 1975, the Mt. Coffee plus gas turbine alternative is the most economic
investmtent program to meet forecast demand. In the wet season, when run-off
is adequate, fuel wfould be saved; in the dry season, because of the available
headpond capacity, hydro capacity could be utilized to best effect for peak-
ing. Up to a discount rate of 15% the hydro/gas turbine combination is
cheaper than the lowest capital cost alternative of gas turbines only.
4.02      The 15% return calculation was tested with --
(a) three different load forecasts:
(i)  maximum -- same as the probable forecast shown
in Annex 2 but including possible additional
industrial sales totalling 26.0 NW by 1973;
(ii)  nrobahle -- as shown in AnnAx 2 but with the
growth rate after 1974 for residential and
Governme-nt sales decreasing to give an average
growth rate of 15% for the 1969-1981 period; and
(iii) minimurm -- industrial sales as for the probable
load forecast but with the average annual growth
creasing to give an average growth rate of 12%.

5. THE BORROWER
5.0.      The Public Utilities Authority (PUA) was established in june
1962 as the successor to the Monrovia Power Authority, created by Law in
June 1960 to generate, sell, transmit and distribute electrical energy
thrcughout the country.   In 1963, the Division of Water and Sewers of the
Department of Public Works was transferred to PUA.
5.02      The following two general issues affecting PUA were resolved
during negotiations:
(i)  Although improvements can be made, PUA is generally
well managed and operated. Consequently, there is
a possibility that its scope of operations may be
enlarged to cover other public utility activities.
In order to ensure that both PEJA's organization and
staff are adequate to support an extension of non-
power operations without detriment to the efficiency
of power operations assurances were obtained during
negotiations that the scope of PUA's non-power activi-
ties will not be extended without the Bank's prior
agreement.
(ii)  Liberia has no statutes nertainine to water riehts and
although no other significant usage is now envisaged,
thf3 Governmenit during negotiatirons, gave assurances
that except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, PUA
shall have nriority in the iiue of thpe flow of the
water of the St. Paul River up to a natural flow of

5.05      This corLtract was renewed 1i 1966 and again in 1969 for three
years, but may be terminated by PUA at any time. During negotiations assur-
ances were obtained that PUA, to the extent necessary, will continue to
employ competent and experienced management consultants acceptable to the
Bank.
5.06,     Although the new contract dated November 19, 1969 reduces the
nunmer of S&P personnel for PUA's power operations from seven to four, it
provides that the S&P New York office will maintain close liaison and pro-
vide! staff support as required to supplement the field managemernt staff.
5i07      Early in 1969 the General lanager, an S&P employee, resigned.
His functions have been taken over by the Chairman of the Board, wjho is
an electrical engineer and is endowed with a dynamic personality. Although
the Chairman is a very competent executive, he has other official duties:
he is the Commissioner of Communications and Telephones, Consultant to the
Department of Plarming, and Cabinet Minister for Public Utilities. As
further discussed in paragraphs 5.09 and 5.10, PUA should make arrangements
to appoint a Manaeer to relieve the Chairman of the responsibility of day-
to-day operations as soon as possible.
2Manizational Stricture
5.o8      Liberians capable of filling senior positions are available among
the staff but lack executnve experie-lee hbeause executive nositions are
presently occupied by the S&P Management Team. Consequently, instead of
providing supervision and guidannce as they are crontra--ted to do, the Planage-
ment Team is also handling the day-to-day operations. Implementation of
procedures for improving the efficiency of operations is      …- +herey dlny-

5.10      With these changes, it should be possible before November 1972
(wnen the S&P contract expires) to select from among the Liberian count1Ier-
parts two candidates to fill the positions of Manager and Assistant Mainager
A p1hasing out of expatriate assistance should then be possible.
Assurances were obtained that the positions of Manager and Assistant Manager
rill be filled by not later than November 1972 and the Bank will be coI1-
sulted with regard to the suitability of the candidate selected for the
posi-tion of Manager and with regard to any subsequent changes in this post.

Staff
5.1l      The staff of PUA is both competent and adequate. The number
employed by PUA, exclusive of the S&P Management Team, has increased with
growth of the undertaking from 370 in 1965 to 576 in 1969. These numbers
are reasonable by comparison with similar utilities in other areas.  Il
the same period, the number of expatriates employed (again excluding the
Management Team) dlropped from 18 to 12. The Management Team now has seven
members, four of whom are in the Power Department and the other three in
the Water and Sewer Department. Nevertheless, additional staff is required
in the field of accountancy (paragraph 5.17).
Training
5.12      The need for training is minimal because, as indicated above,
the PEJA staff is well aualified. The senior staff members have Dar-
ticularly excellent qualifications.
5.13      Prior to 1964l, there was virtually no in-service training.  In
that yers, bee-ause of the rvpnor vnnrii1+hn of the nower f Iac;iities; a "'-raqh-
training" program was started in order to train Liberian personnel in opera-
ting techniques aria th.us free the exatriate person^nel to do only super-
vision and urgently needed repair and maintenance of equipment. The program
wtas successful a-e!-nIo  T-v,riar. are ope +qp ,  A-el ge,ne, atin  s;to Ar4
as wrell as the Mt. Coffee plant.
5.l4      A scholarship program was initiated early in 1964 to provide
4t-ecLI 1,C61A,--4" ca  edcti; in _ Lb-ia  85 A rsle Eo-- -  _-P TJYA + -I -A -- -dng -ofP 41; s

completed their training and returned to Liberia, while the other three
are still in school and are expected to return in 1970.
5.i5,    aequate public facilities are available in Liberia Ior the
training of electricians and diesel mechanics. Selected students are
giVen on-the-job training cduring vacations, and iI iTheir perIormcance
is satisfactory they are engaged permanently after graduation.  Thus
there is no need at present for riuA to have its own training program.
As there are no public facilities for training linesmen, however, PUA
proposes instituting a program for that purpose; selected candidates who
have completed prinmary education will attend a three-year apprentice
course, with the first year devoted to classroom study and two years to
on-the-job traininrg.
Procedural Deficiencies
5.16      There are a number of procedural deficiencies which, if elimi'-
nated, would improve PUA's efficiency. They are in the following area;:
accounts receivable; stores, warehouse, material control and purchasirng;
budget and budgetary control; allocation of labor costs to operations,
maintenance and capital works; establishment of cost controls; procedures

consumers and the level, if any, of contributions required for such exten-
siors; meter reading and disconnectinig procedures; and preparation of long-
term financial programs.
5.17       UJA and the Management Team are aware of these shortcomings.  PUS
has agreed to add two qualified accoimtants to its accounting staff to imprc r
adninistration of accounts receivrables; introduce budget preparation and
budgetary control; establish cost controls including allocations of labor
costs to operations, maintenance and capital works; establish procedures to
determine the justification for distribution extension servicing individual
consumers and the level, if any, of contributions required for such exten-
sions; and preparation of long-term financial programs. PUA has further agree(.
to improve stores, warehouse, material control and purchasing administration
under supervision of its management consultants (S&P). Additional steps tc
improve accounts receivable are discussed in paragraph 6.10.
Scorpe of Operations
5.18      As indicated in paragraph 5.01 PUA is not only responsible for
power but also for water and sewer services. Water facilities now in opera-
tion. in Mkonrovia are expected to sernre the needs beyond 1975. Sewer fa.cil-
ities presently under construction in Monrovia and financed by USAID will1
also serve! needs bypvond 197q- Thus, no major investmPnts are needed for
these services and. all expansion during the next few years will be in power.

and those ulnder c-t"onS+ 4-tn toget-her with tariffs, customers served, and

continue to employ independent aud-itors acceptable to the Bank; (b) the
practice of separate audit for each department will be continued; and
(c) within four months of the end of each year, the auditor's report and
certified annual financial statements will be sent to the Bank.



Insurance
5.2't     PUA does not carrv insulrance against normal risks excePt on iLts

6. FINANCES
General
6.01      The important financial characteristics of FUA as of December 31,
1969 are:
(a)  The Fower Department accounts for the bulk of the
gross assets and revenues - 80% and 86%, respectively;
(b) a capital structure heavily loaded with debt (debt/
eauity ratio 77:23):
(c)  a satisfactory current position (current ratio 1.6:1);
(d)  very low debt service coverage (1.1 times); and
(e)  unsatisfactory earnings (rate of return 4.7%).
6.02      This is not a reassuring background for considering the financing
of a orogram which rl l increase r PA1s gIross f J3d assets from US$8 million
to US$83 million (64%) in five years. However, with sales expected to
aL most doublei a-ntd operatngjn -i ncom.ne moreg thin-n rlniubleo rl-ig the) s!qnpe periodji
a satisfactory financing plan has been developed.  The reasons for the prese.
sitution, ani d the outlook, are A-scuss      T below  PTAsIconsolidatedfin:ncia
statements for the period 1966-74 are shown in Annexes 10, 11 and 12.
Recent Financial History of PUA
6.03      During the 1966-69 period, FUA completed the USAID financed first
The two projects were financed 89% by borrowings and 8% by Government con-

provided by PUA from earnings.  At the same time a smaller program in sewerage
-was started, also financed largely with debt.
6.o4       Details of power loans outstanding are shomn in paragrapn 6.07.
The only debt for water is a USAID loan of US$7 million with an interest
rate to PuA (the loan was made to Government for the water treatment plant
on concessionary terms) of 3.5%. Repayment is over 30 years beginning in
1975. Sewerage debt is the disbursed portion of a -uSAID loan of uS$7.2
mill-ion with the concessionary terms passed on to PUA.
6.05      PUA in mid-1967 made a reduction averaging 23% in power tariffs
(paragraph 6.12) causing the rate of return for powrer to fall from 5.5% in
1966 to 4.4% in 1967 and 4.2% in 1968. The return is estimated to have
increased to 5.4% :Ln 1969. WIater tariffs were reduced in September 1969
resulting in an estimated return of 2.2% for that year.
Finances of the Power Department
6.o6      The Power Department is the dominant department of PUA, accounting
for 80% of gross fixed assets and 86% of revenues in 1969.  Gross fixed assets
of the power department amounted to US$46 million on December 31, 1969.
This amount includes US$13 million for the Bushrod power station, for w'ilc'r

from the Government that the transfer will be made by June 30, 1971.
6.07      The long-term debt represexnts 81% of the Power Department's
(i)  Ex-Mim Bank loans OI- uS$.27 mdiiiion in 195y9 and1
US$4.75 million in 1961 to finance generating plant
at the Krutown, Sinkor and bushrod power stations.
The interest rate for both loans is 5.75% and the
current repayment schedule calnls for full repayment
by 1978;
(ii)  a USAID loan of US$24.3 million in 1963 to construct
the first 34 III stage of the Mt. Coffee hydro-electric
project. The loan was made to the Government at 0.75%
interest and relent to PUA at 3.5% interest. Repayment
is in 61 semi-annual installments, the first in the
secolid half of 1969; and   -
(iii)  a suppliers' credit from Brown Boveri in 1968 for
US$0.654 million to finance 70% of the foreign exchange
cost of a gas turbine at the Bushrod power station.
The interest rate is 6.75% and amortization is in 60
equal monthly installments, ending in early 1974.
6.08      Equity in the Power Department primarily represents Government
contributions towards construction of the first stage of the Mt. Coffee
project and accumulated net revenues.  The Iower Department has issued
US$7,o0000 common stock to Government in order to formalize the ownership.
No dividends have been paid and none are contemplated during the proposed
project construction period, earnings beine retained to finance further
development.  In view of the tight cash position through 1973-74 (Annex 14),
confirmation wJas obtained that no cash dividend w.ill be paid during the
loan disbursement period (through 1974). Pbwer Department balance sheet
projentions are shown in Annex 13.

6.10      To improlve its accounts receivable collections, PUA has agreed to
(i) engage required accountiung staff to im-prove aUi-ni-stration of accc,-It
rece:ivables (paragraph 5.17); (ii) disconnect anyone who is delinquent Vor



- 18 -
more! than 90 days; (iii) remove meter and service connection after the
consumer has been disconnected for 30 days without making arrangements to
settle arrears, to avoid illegal reconnection; (iv) maintain reconnection
fees at US$25; and (v) require higher deposits from consumers with bad
payment records. PUA has agreed to take additional corrective action as
needed and to inform the Banik periodically of progress achieved and any
clifficulties encountered.  It is assumed in Annex 13 that with improved
collection policies there will be no increase beyond the 1968 level in
accounts receivable (net) through 1974.
6.11      In 1966 the Government agreed to establish a clearing account with
PUA, and subsequently has provided PUA with a full list of all premises for
which the Government is liable for payments in respect of electricity, water
and seweragge. The list includes all office buildings, street lighting, and
residences of Government officials entitled to free utilities.  PUA periodi-
callr nets all the Government bills against the amount owied the Government
for debt service, etc. The system works well at the moment and is expected
to continue workingr well for the next several years, during which PUA will
owe more to Government than Government owes PUJA. The situation will be kept
under constant review, however, and included in the Bank's reporting require-
ments under the nronosed loan.

In practice the PUA Power Department has maintained such level of tariff's

pletion of the Mt. Coffee hydro-electric project, PUA reduced power rates
by 23% on average.  This reduction was both too much and too soon and caused
the rate of return to fall to 4.2% in 1968.  It is expected however that
based on existing rates, the retun will gradually improve o        n y 11%
in 1973 wJhich is satisfactory.  The financing plan discussed below has been
tariffs will not be reduced during the loan disbursement period (1970-74)
aLd wthat thereauter they will be adjusted ani-d miaintauined atj a level which
will ensure a return of at least 10% on the Power Department's realistically
valued average net fixed assets in operation.  This will result in a con-
tribution of at least 30% to the Power Department's ongoing construction
progrcam from internai casn generation.
Proposed Financing P-lan
0.13      The 1970-7!t financing plan for PEJA is sunnarized below. it will
be noted that the project constitutes less than half the construction expendi.-
ture during the period. Of the total capitaL requirements, 30% will be met
from internal cash generation and 70% from borrowings. Details of the sourcec
and applications of funds are shown in Annex 14.

6.19      The rate of return for PUA as a whole is estimated to be lower in

Mt. Coffee Hydro-Electric Project
1.        The 34 NW Mt. Coffee Hydro-Electric Project, including transnrission
facilities was completed in late 1965 at a cost of US$29.1 million or
US$855/kW and was financed by USAID (IJS$24.3 million), the Government of
Liberia (U'S$3.8 million), and by PUA (US$1.0 million).
2.        The power plant, located on the St. Paul River 15 miles NE of
Monrovia has presently installed two 17 MWl generating units'. The plant can
be expanded to six units giving a totaLl installed capacity of 102 I&W.
3.        The project is a run-of-the-river plant constructed as the initial.
phase of a proposed developnent of the St. Paul River's hydro-electric poteni-
tial. Full utilization of the existing as well as the future expanded Mt.
Coffee facilities depends upon the construction of water storage facilities
upstream to augment river flows during the dry season each year.
4.        Extraordi-iarv low flows occurred over a Deriod of about six weeks
in March and April L967 during which flows of less than 25% of minirumm esti-
mated flows used for design were recorded for several consecutive days.
On the average. for about 280 days each year, unregulated flows in
the river are sufficient to operate one unit continuously at full output.
Five units can be operated continouslvy a-t full load n-bout 1J)J days each year..
St  Paul Rivrpr Basin
6.        The total drannage area  bTove Mt. Coffee is about 8,260 sq mnles.
The basin is about 1t0 miles wide and 200 miles long.  The river rises in the
plateaui co,,ntv.ir of southern G,nea pq  flow  SW +t +the A+lan"tic Oceo' near
Monrovia.

80 ft of wJhich have been developed by the Mt. Coffee project for generating
electric powver.

9>.       Ihvestigations to develop the hydro-electric potential of the St.
Paul River date back to 1946. In 1962 the Stanley Engineering Company of

Temporary concrete plugs at the entrances to future penstocks now control water
in the forebay. Gaites will be installed in the gate slots to stop wate:r whi'le
the bulkheads are being removed and the penstocks installed and connected to
the intake structure.
14.       A cofferciam exists across the tailrace exit of future units to peri-rnt
those portions of the additions to the power house lying below tailrace water
level to be constructed in the dry.   As additional units are commissioned, the
portion of the cofferdam enclosing them will be modified to protect the re-
maining cofferdam f'rom erosion.
15.       The existing two unit power house contains the erection bay, the
operating room, auxiliary equipment, water and sanitary services for the six
unit plant.. A temporary wall exists at the outer end of Unit Bay No. 2. This
wall will be removed when the structure housing Unit 3 is completed.    Bedrock
was excavated for trnit 3 and the space back-filled.  Bedrock occupies the site
for tUnits It thru 6 below about the level of the generating floor. Blast;ing
will be required and will be scheduled at times of the day when loss of Mt.
Coffee will not interrupt system operation.
Rainf'all
16.       Run-off in the St. Paul River is closely related to rainfall in the
catchment area. Two distinct seasons for rainfall occur with transitiorn
seasons in between.  The wet season generally begins in Mlay of each year and



ANUIEX -i
Page 3of 6 Pages
continues wiith increasing rainfall intensity until September-October followed
by a tapering-off period thru mid-November. December thru Iflarch is generally
dry, although scattered irregular showers occur.
Goastal RF,ion     120 inches/annum during Nay-July and September-October.
Inland              90 inches/annum during N4ay-October.
17.       Because of the narrow basin, run-off is sensitive to changes Jn
amount and in intensity of rainfall.   Extreme-type occurrences of rainfall
produce droughts and floods that cause the power potential of the river to
vary great:Ly, especially in the low-f'Low season.
Run-off
18.       Except for 1967-68. run-off at Mt. Coffee during the period of
records April 1958 - March 1968 would have been sufficient to operate five
units continuously at full rated outnuit if the run-off were fully regulated..
The unregulated river flow would have been sufficient to operate all si:
units at full outtDLt for about 160 days ner year.  But flows in 8 of the 10
annual dry seasons of record dropped to less than the amount required to
onerate one uinit at full capacity for nperiods ranging from one day (Anril
1959) up tc) 89 consecutive days (January-April 1967).
19.       Recorded flows at k1t. Coffee ranged from a low estimated average of
)l5O cu sec; for afnve ray period in April 19Q7 +.o a high of l!O,000 _cu secs
in August 1966.  Arnual run-off of the St. Paul River at IMt. Coffee for the

21.       ± For 5-6 nonths each year, flows are sufficient to operate five o-
more units continuously at full capacity. During the remainder of the year
flowfs vary down to an amount sufficierit to operate one unit at rated outpult
for only a few hours each day.
22'       Current stream flow records and rainfall records at stations having
long continuous records were correlated giving an indication of potential
frequency of extreme low-flow occurrences over the past 33 years.    Ten-day
avrerage flows of 2,000 cu secs or more in this period are estimated to have
been available 98% of the time.

23.       The capability of HIt. Coffee at low river discharges for supp]ying
present system loacds is Low. As the system load grows, equivalent water flo7w;s
will have increasing peak shaving capabilities but only because of the shorter
durations of the higher load peaks. One unit of Mt. Coffee can handle the top
16 MW of the 34 rMW system peak load when river flows are 1,400 cu secs. IN.hen
system peak load becomes about 150 IvW, the peak shaving capability will double
at the same river flow.
24.       The dependable capability of Mt. Coffee for meeting peak system de-
mand in the dry seasons of the early years will be only a small part of the
rating of the units no matter how sooni or how rapidly additional generating
units are installed. after Unit No. 3. The shape of the daily load curve and
the limited amount of water available fix the part of the system peak load the
plant can handle. As the system load increases the same number of units in
the plant will contribute larger amounts of power for meeting system loads,
but they will operate for increasing shorter periods of the day. During those
parts of each vear when river flows are adeouate the units can be operated orn
base load.
25.       Mt. Coffee is capable of producing energy to meet the full system
load un to a dailv nperlk load of abouit 86 T& for 177 dnys per year- As the
system load increases beyond 86 MW the energy capability will continue to
innre' e iint-il +.h nrs+  rann absorb as base 102d fthe fuill continiuous outniit
of 5 units.  This is estimated to occur when the system daily load reaches
nhmut 176 MW.

value only for energDy thereby reducing fuel consumption at therl-mal plants.
27.      'whnen tne savings in the cost of fuel at therimal plants, resi±LtThg
from the hydro replacement energy that is tisable in the system, is sufficient
to defray the irnvestxment and operating costs oI nydru units, tnese can bUe

the hydro unit can produce 39 GWh of usable energy for gas turbine fuel re-
plaoQnent or 50 GWh of usable energy in the case of steam fuel replacement.
Up-^tream Storage
28.       Based on the 10 years of flow records available, the amount of
stored water required to produce uniform flows at Mt. Coffee are:

29.       Mt. Coffee can utilize a flow of 15,200 cu secs with 5 units and
18,300 cu secs with six units when continuously operated on base 'Load. The
full continuous output of 85 kil (five units) on base load can be absorbed into
the s;ystem when the system peak is between 175-180 IWJ estimated to occur in
about 1981.
Mecca Dam Site
30.       This site on the St. Paul River is about 24 miles up-stream of Mt.
Coffee and about 40 miles from M4onrovia. Total storage volume is about
460,000 acre ft with a useful storage of about 300,000 acre ft.
31.       A powier plant could be constructed at the foot of the dam and six
17 NtJ units ultimately installed producing about h38 GWh per annum of which
275 GlWh woouLd be firm.
32.       The result of the IMIecca storage on Mt. Coffee would be to increase
minimLm flow in the dry season (1967) from 450 cu secs to about 2,800 cu secs
or in an average year fron 2,000 cu secs to about 4,000 cu secs.
33.       Mecca dam however is estinated (1969 costs) at about US$33.4 million
without the power nlant. With a svytemn peak load of about 40f9 NW exnected to
be reached in 1989 the peak shaving capability of Mt. Coffee would be inc:reased
hy 56 MU at a cost Cif about TJT6Anof/irw mrnd w-uld nrovide only 1I3. rlTJh of arl-
ditional energy.
34.       Compared with a thermal plant providing the same service, the
benefit/cost ratio of the Mfecca st;orage woulnd be:
0.31 TuhnV% r. nmnMared T.4 1-. ga  b ,o
0.47 when compared with a steam plant.
Gbakrele and Palakole Dam Sites
35.       In addition to the Mecca site two other sites have been investigated,

(i)  Gbalwele. A tributary of the St. Paul River, the Via Rivrer
a1oove Gbakwele has a catchment area of aDout 1,300 sq miLes
and a run-off of about 18% of the St. Paul River at Mt. (offee,
Withi a useful storage of about 3.3 million acre ft, the iia
flowrs would have to be cut off early enough to ensure fi:LLirng
the reservoir. Run-off at Gbakwele is estimated at about
2.6 m.a.f. for the period mid-May to end of December.  No
water would be released during this seven-month period in
most years. In the other 5 months wzater release would be
limLted to amounts required to firm up Mt. Coffee. Generation
of prime power at Gbakwele does not appear to be practicable.
(ii)  Palakole. A tributary of the St. Paul, Tuma Creek above
Palatkole has a catchment area of about 700 sq miles. An
average annual run-off of about 0.75 m.a.f. has been est"-
mated. I-ath a useful storage of about 600,000 acre ft, tIhe
TuniL flows would be cut off at about mnid-May or earlier if
possible and released to Mt. Coffee to cover peak-shaving
requirements.
Costs
36.      CGbakwele           US$62.0 million or about $20/a.f.
Palakole           US$37.0 million or about $62/a.f.
37.       Peak shaving capability added by GbakwJele to Mt. Coffee in an
extreme dry season would reach about 62 NW.  The benefit/cost ratio when
compared with a thermal plant providing the same service would be only 0.40
wihich wouldi indicate that the reservo:lr wrould be uneconomic- Palakole com-
pared with Gbakwele is much smaller and would cost about three times as much
per acre ft; of usable storage  As an alternative to Gbakwele, Palakole does
not warrant; further investigations.

1.        Prior to 19h3 water supply in Monrovia was dependent on private
wells and rain cisterns.  In 195l construction of a Dublic water suppl;y
system was started. Infiltration galleries and a pumping station on
Rushrod Island, transmission fnnilitips to Monronvia  a 6nn00jooo gallon
reservoir in Monrovia and distribution mains were constructed. Pumping

ation and maintenance were reported with the Wlater Department.
6.        Improvements to the sanitary sewer system currently under con-
struction to be completed in 1971 are designed for an average capacity Of
6 million gallons/day for Monrovia with an ultimate capacity of 24 million
gallons/day.
7.        improvements consist of:
(i)  A 6-mi l ion gallon/day filter sewage treatment plant
with an outfall to the Mesurado River;
(ii)  Three pumping stations and approximately 16 miles of
10 to 20-inch diameter force mains; one station to be
situated near the treatment plant; one on the south side
of Monrovia; and one at the south end of Bushrod Island.
(iii)  Interceptor sewers totalling about 14 miles ranging in
size from 8 to 72 inches;
(iv)  21.3 miles of 8-inch diameter sewer laterals on Bushrod
Island; Monrovia, and Sinkor; and
(v)  About 5,000 service connections within public rights-of-way.

B.        The system will provide interceptors and additional laterals ifor the
present system in M4onrovia proper, will extend the sewer system to Bushrod
Island and Sinkor, and will provide for treatment of all sewage collected.
9.        (hn October 8, 1965, USAID provided a loan of US$7.2 million to the
Government of Liberia for PUA for the construction and equipment of an expanded
sewer system for Monrovia and its environs. The Government agreed to provide
not less than US$800,000 to cover the local cost component of the project.
10.       The interest rate is one per cent per annum for a period of 10 years
follcnring the date of the first disbursement.  Thereafter the rate will be
2-1/2% per annum on the principal due payable se3i-annually.  The payment of
principal is to be made in 61 semiannual insta:Luients; the first due 9-1/2
years after the first interest pavment. The re-lending terms to PUA are the
same.,

12.       Proposed sewser rates have been calculated on the basis as a per-
centage of water rates.  Customers utilizing sewers but having private water
supply wiill be given ofLicial attention.  hIle present use ol drainage cess-
pools, septic tanks and other waste disposal systems would also have to be
considered.  In general all customers wihuin the sewer service area supPiied
with water will be required to connect, to the new system. Exceptions are the
Free Port where much of the water used is sold for ships' use; the brewery
which has a waste disposal system; and the Executive Mansion which has an
activated sludge-type sewage disposal plant in operation.
13.       The rates are 60% of the rate for water service.  This rate gives:
Pdnimum monthly charge including first
2,000 gallons                                 $1.50
Rate for 1,000 gallons

14.       To smooth the transition from no charges for sewer services for
those customers already connected to the public sewer system, the above rates
are to be put into effect prior to completion of the new system in 1971..
