TO THE EX;-.CUTI-JE DI1EO''CRS ON A Pui.OPO61D LOAN
TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES AUTHORITY OF LIBERIA
WITH THE GUARA4TEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$7.4 million to
the Public Utilities Authority (PUA) in Liberia to assist in financing
a power expansion program.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.       The Government approached the Bank for financial assistance for
power expansion in September 1968. However, consideration of the Govern-
ment's request had to await the outcome of a U.S. AID-financed study of
Liberia's power development and investigation of alternative means of
meeting the expected power requirements. The consultants' final report
was received at the end of August 1969. After the Bank had reviewed the
report, it appraisedthe project in November 1969.
3.       Negotiations were held in Washington from April 30 to May 7,
1970. The Borrower and the Liberian Government were represented by The
Honorable Taylor Major, Secretary of Public Utilities, Mr. Frank Stewiart,
Under Secretary of the Treasury for Fiscal Affairs, and His Excellency
S. Edward Peal, Ambassador of Liberia to the United States.
4.       The following is a statement of Bank loans to Liberia as of
April 30, 1970:

5.        The road project financed by Loan 368 LBR has been completed;
the port dredging project financed by Loan 617 LBRL is under execution
and progress is satisfactory.
6.        The Government's request for Bank Group assistance for rubber
rehabilitation and replanting and for power distribution are under
consideration and are scheduled to be appraised later this year and
early next year, respectively.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOANI
7.        BORROITER:                 Public Utilities Authority
GUARANTOR:                 Republic of Liberia
AMOUNT:                    Equivalent in various currencies
of US$7.4 million
PURPOSE:                   To finance the foreign cost of
generating facilities, a trans-
mission line, and consulting
services.
AMORTIZATIOM:              In 20 years, including a 5-year
grace period, through equal semi-
annual installments beginning on
July 1, 1975 and ending on January 1,
1990.
INTEREST RATE:             7% per annum
CON11ITNENT CHARGE:       3/4 of 1% per annum.
PART III - THE PiROJECT
8.        The appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of Public Utilities
Authority Power Expansion Project, Republic of Liberia" (PU-38a) is
attached.
9.        The Borrower (PUA) is a statutory corporation with a 10-member
Board of Directors appointed by the President of Liberia. It was estab-
lished in 1962 with responsibility for generation and distribution of power.



- 3 -
The Authority was subsequently also made responsible for wiater and sewer-
age operations. The Authority generates about 35 percent of the total
power consumed in the country, serving Monrovia and Buchanan, an important
port for iron ore exports. The remaining 65 percent is generated by captive
plants principally of the iron ore companies. As agent of the Government
PUA also generates and distributes electricity in six secondary centers.
As these operations are uneconomic, the Government compensates PUA for
losses, and has undertaken to continue to do so.
10.       FUA's power market has been growing in recent years at an annual
average rate of 21 percent and the average annual growth rate during the
next 5 years is estimated at 17 percent. PUA's power generation and distr_'i-
bution program for 1970-74 is estimated to cost US$21.4 million, of which
$15.3 million, or 70 percent, is expected to be financed from external
loans and the remaining US$6.1 million, or 30 percent, from internal cash
generation. Taking into consideration the proposed Bank loan and other
borrowings, PUA would require additional assistance of US$5.3 million
through 1974. PUA expects to borrow this amount from tlhe Bank and other
sources.
11.       The project would consist of installation and commissioning of
one 17 MW turbine-generator unit (No. 3) for the existing IMount Coffee
power station; civil works for Units 3 and 4; excavation only for Unit 5;
installation of two 15 MW gas turbine units; construction of 15 miles of
transmission lines; and consultants, services for Mount Coffee expansion
and a distribution study. The cost of the project is estimated to be
$9.7 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$7.4 million would finance the
foreign cost of the project, representing 76 percent of the total.
12.       The proposed expansion program represents the least-cost means
of meeting demand for power. The rate of return on the incremental hydro-
investment would be 15 percent. The incremental financial rate of return
on the proposed investment as a wihole, including gas turbines required to
firm up Mount Coffee power, is estimated at 20 percent.
13.       PUA staff is generally competent. Since 1963 PUA has had a
management contract with an American consulting firm, Sanderson & Porter.
Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that PUA will delegate
greater responsibility to its Liberian staff, with a view to train;ing
them for management positions and phasing out management consultants in
a reasonable time. There are a number of procedural deficiencies. PUA
has undertaken to engage extra staff to remedy these deficiencies, parti-
cularly in the area of accounts receivables, meter reading and disconnec-nr<
services.
14.       In the past PUA has not alwxays run its operations along sound
commercial lines. In 1967 power rates were reduced by an average of
23 percent to mark the completion of the first phase of the IMount Coffee
project. This caused the rate of return on average net fixed assets



in operation to fall to 4.2 percent in 1968. Assurances have been obtained
that PUA will not reduce its tariffs during the loan disbursement period,
and would set rates to enable it to earn a rate of return of at least 10
percent on its power department's average net fixed assets in operation as
from the beginning of 1974, thereby ensuring that it would be able to meet
about 30 percent of future power construction requirements. Debt service
will be barely covered in 1970, and PUA has agreed not to incur any further
long-term debt unless peak debt service in any succeeding year is covered
at least 1.5 times by internal cash generation.
15.       PUA intends to apply commercial standards also to its water and
sewerage operations.  The financial return from these operations has been      1
low or negative, but PUA has undertaken from January 1, 1974, to ensure
that revenues from water and sewerage operations cover operating costs and
debt service and make a contribution to capital.
16.       Procurement will be on the basis of international competitive
bidding. Consultants will be engaged for design review, and preparation
of tender documents and specifications for Mount Coffee. The staff of
the Borrower, with the assistance of their management consultants, is
capable of installing and commissioning the gas turbine units and is also
capable of designing and erecting 69 KV transmission lines. The cormis-
sioning of the first gas turbine unit is scheduled for March 1971 and the
second for March 1972. The hydro unit at Mount Coffee will be in service
in March 1973.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
17.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Public
Utilities Authority and Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of
Liberia and the Bank, the Report of the committee provided for in Article
3 Section V(iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft Loan Agreement and the draft Guarantee Agreement
substantially follow the pattern of loan and guarantee agreements for pow3r
projects. The following provisions, in addition to those referred to abovee,
are of particular interest:
(a)  PUA will not engage in any non-power activities other
I ',  than water and sewerage unless it shall have first
-  satisfied the Bank that the extension of its present
activities shall not adversely affect the efficiency
of power operations (see Section 5.14 of the draft
Loan Agreement), and
(b) Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, the Guarantor
shall give the Borrower priority in the use of the flow
of the St. Paul river up to a natural flow of 18,300 c.ft.
per second for power generation at Mount Coffee (see
Section 2.06 of the draft Guarantee Agreement).

PART V - TIE ECONOMY
18.       Liberia has a dual economy with enclave operations in iron ore
mining and rubber plantations and a large and underdeveloped agricultural
sector which provides a living for over 70 percent of the population.
While per capita GNP is estimated at around $230, per_capiaYinJnms.ato
side the enclave operations are probably hardly                      r.
19.       The report entitled "The Current Economic Situation and Prospects
of Liberia" (AW'-5a) which was circulated to the Executive Directors on
June 2, 1969, noted that the economy of Liberia had continued to grow at a
satisfactory rate during the 1960's, mainly due to strongly expanded iron
ore and rubber production; GDP in real terms increased by 4 percent between
1960 and 1967. In 1968, GDP in real terms is estimated to have grown at
about 5 percent. No GDP estimate is available for 1969, but iron ore and
rubber production are known to have increased substantially; iron ore
exports are estimated to have increased by more than 10 percent. As a
result of these improvements, the surplus on the foreign trade account has
risen from $33.6 million in 1967 to an estimated $55.0 million in 1969.
After allowing for invisibles, the current account showed deficits of
less than US$10 million in 1968 and 1969 as compared to US$30 million in
1967.
20.       In the past seven years the economic policy of Liberia has
centered around the implementation of a stabilization program associated
with financial and technical assistance from the IMF. The stabilization
program was necessitated by financial difficulties resulting from a large
amount of foreign debts incurred between 1958 and 1962, in anticipation
of substantial increases in iron ore production, and subsequent increase
in government revenues. This, however, did not materialize due to un-
expected decline in iron ore prices. Under the stabilization program,
the government restrained its current expenditure, introduced tax measures,
improved tax administration and enforcement, and was able to obtain a
rescheduling of its debt repayments.  The p=uit of these pp   icies
together with       d   echeduling o      t repayments due in the years
1969-1971 were primarily responsil   for a marked improvement in the
country's budget position in the past two years. The budgetary surplus
(after allowing for debt service payments) has increased from $0.3 million
in 1967 to $4.7 million in 1969.
21.       Pu.blic debt service payments continue to represent a heavy burden
on the budget.  These payments constituted about 24 percent of total budzet-
ar_revenues in 1969, inspite of the recent rescheduling agreement. As a
percentage of commodity exports,'debt service payments amounted to 7.7
percent in 1969.  However, after allowing for the substantial amount of
interest and profit remittances by foreign concessionaires, debt service
payments would amount to about 16 percent of "net" export earnings in
1969.



22.       Th-e Dprospects of the Liberian economy in 1970 seem to be favor-
able. Both the value and volume of iron ore and rubber production are
expected to continue rising.  Priva-te and public investment, both of which
increased in 1069, are expected to rise moderately in 1970. Beyond 1970
there is some prospect for lurther major investments, should the present
prospecting for oil and for new iron ore deposits be successful.  The
governmnentis emphasis in its development effort is shifting towards the
long neglected agricultuwal sector (outside rubber plantations). The
irnitial aim is to increase the output of rice with a view to achieving
self-sufficiency. There are aIlso fairly good prospects for increased
forestry exploitation.
23.       0t.ing to the continued budgetary pressure arising from its debt
service obligations, it is desirable that part of the external assistance
to Liberia be extended on concessional terms. However, continuation of
the present sound fiscal policies should enable the government to increa3e
its ;public saving contribution to development expenditure and make it
possible to incur some newT debts on conventionlal terms.
PART VI - COH?LIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREIMT1RIT
2h.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - E2COii  . Z-DATIS
25.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
