I.  SECTOR BACKGROUND
A. The Energy Sector
Energy Resources
1.01     Yugoslavia's commercially exploitable domestic energy resources
consist of hydropower and lignite, followed in order of importance by brown
and hard coal, oil and gas, and uranium. Oil shale reserves are also known to
exist, but because of technological constraints their conmmercial exploitation
at present would be uneconomic. rn addition, Yugoslavia has a substantial
non-conventional energy resource base consisting of biomass, solar and wind
energy, and some geothermal resources. The hydropower potential is estimated
at about 63 TWh p.a., divided among 400 sites in 25 river basins and catchment
areas, of which 55 TWh (4.64 million toe) are exploitable. The remaining 8
TWh cannot be developed economically as they are located in close proximity of
densely populated areas. To date, 27 TWh (431) of the total hydro potential
has been developed.
1.02     Proven reserves of hard and brown coal and lignite are estimated at
about 14,612 million tons (3,005 million toe). Proven reserves of hard coal
are in the neighborhood of 61 million tons (40 million toe), all of which
require underground mining, but presently, only 60Z (36.6 million tons) of the
reserves are exploitable. Proven reservcs of brown coal are estimated at
1,278 million tons (437 million toe) about 70% (894 million tons) of which
would require underground mining. The remaining 301 (383 million tons) are
suitable for open pit mining. Lignite is Yugoslavia's principal domestic
energy resource. Its proven reserves are estimated at about 13,300 million
tons (2,622 million toe). The bulk of the lignite reserves is concentrated in
a few localities suitable for open pit mining, and consequently, significant
economies of scale could be achieved in its development and production.
1.03     Yugoslavia's remaining recoverable onshore oil reserves are estimated
to be about 70 million tons. Geological evidence suggests that the scope for
delineating important extension to existing fields and for finding smaller
accumulations in subtle traps is still considerable. A number of other
potential petroleum producing regions have as yet to be evaluated, but
preliminary indications are that their potential is not as large as that of
the currently producing regions. The prospects of finding at least another 35
million tons of oil in Croatia and Vojvodina are good.  It is estimated that
there are about 70 million toe of gas in the presently known onshore fields.
In addition, preliminary estimates indicate that several Adriatic Basins and
some land basins are also gas prone. The potential offshore reserves are
expected to yield between 15 and 150 million toe of oil. It is also estimated
that up to 50 million toe of recoverable gas could be extracted from the
Adriatic and a similar amount could be found in the deeper parts of thc Drava
and Sava Basins in Croatia.

Energy SuppLy and Foreign Trade
1.04     In 1982, 43% of the country's gross energy supply of 35 million toe
was imported, compared to 38% in 1975. The increase in dependence on imported
energy has been due primarily to delays in projects aimed at expanding
domestic energy production, mainly caused by shortages of finance and also by
the implementation of projects that consumed imported fuels, selected to meet
regional rather than national objectives. Crude oil and oil products
accounted for 64% of imported energy in 1982, hard coal 17%, natural gas 12%
and the remainder was mainly nuclear fuel and electricity. Between 1972 and
1981 the value of energy imports increased by US$3.6 billion (in current
prices), compared to an increase in the trade deficit of US$3.8 billion.
Thus, the increasing cost of imported energy and growing dependence on
imported energy have had a major effect on the deterioration of the external
balance of the economy.
Energy Balance
1.05     During the period 1985-90, projects to expand Yugoslavia's production
of lignite, hydroelectric and petroleum are planned to be completed.
Increased energy production, plus reforms in energy pricing and other demand
management policies initiated under the Program of Long-Term Measures for the
Rationalization, Substitution and Conservation of Energy should enable
Yugoslavia to reduce its dependence on imported energy from 43% in 1982 to
about 27% in 1990. However, success in meeting this goal will depend on the
timely completion of well chosen projects and maintaining the momentum for
increasing some energy prices. By 1990, production of brown coal and lignite
is projected to be 58%, natural gas 132% and hydro and nuclear electricity 7S2
above their respective 1982 levels. Whilst final consumption of energy is
projected to increase at an average rate of 2.5% p.a. during the period
1982-90, the gross supply of energy will need to increase slightly faster at
3.5% p.a. This is due partly to the lower efficiency in end use of lignite
and brown coal, compared to petroleum and partly to the increasing use of
electricity, which increases from 19% of final energy consumption in 1982 to
23% in 1990. Energy balances are summarized below:

Energy Pricing
1.06     Domestic prices of petroleum products are on average greater than
their border prices. Lignite price is about 78% of economic cost, and those
of hard and brown coal are 882 and 852 of their respective economic costs.



- 4 -
However. electricity prices are about 76% of preliminary estimate of long-run
marginal cost (LRMC), and domestically produced natural gas (sold only in
Croatia and Vojvodina) is priced at only 50.2% of the border price for gas
used as a source of energy and 40.2% of the border price for gas used as
feedstock and in chemical industries as shown below:

1.07     In the Loan Agreement for the Third Power Transmission Project Loan
(Loan 2338-YU) the Yugoslav authorities agreed on a methodology for estimating
LRMC and to raise tariffs to the level of LRMC by December 31, 1987 (paras
1.09 and 4.18). A similar undertaking is also contained in the Letter of
Development Policy (LDP) signed by the Government in conjunction with the
Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL I, Loan 2326-YU). The authorities have also
agreed to a methodology for calculating the LRMC of lignite and brown coal and
to raise the prices of lignite, brown and hard coal to their respective
economic costs levels by December 31, 1987. Furthermore, the authorities have
undertaken to raise the price of domestic natural gas to parity with the
border price by early 1987. Finally, under the IMF standby, the Government
has agreed to raise petroleum prices to ccmpensate for the depreciation of the
Dinar and in addition has decided to link the prices to changes in
international prices. The Federal Executive Council (FEC), in addition to
setting prices for crude oil and petroleum products, has since July 1983
assumed the responsibility for setting prices for natural gas and for
electricity at the 110-kV level for all republics and provinces. Pricing of
domestic solid fuels which has been the responsibility of the Republican and
Provincial Communities of Interest (RPCIs) would, as of January 1, 1985,
become the responsibility of the FEC according to the new law on the System of



Social Control of Prices.-' Taken together, these measures imply a major
realignment of energy prices to the levels of economic cost, with the aims of
(i) encouraging the economic use of energy in an institutional setting of
decentralized decision making and (ii) mobilization of resources to finance
the increases in energy supply required to reduce Yugoslavia's dependence on
imported energy.
Electricity Pricing
1.08     Although the methodology for calculating the LRMC of electricity has
been agreed, the authorities have not yet completed the studies to calculate
LRMC at the bulk supply level and to design LRMC based tariffs for each
category of consumer. Preliminary estimates of LRMC are available in the
report "Yugoslavia - Constraints and Prospects for Restructuring the Energy
Sector" (Report 4797-YU). A condition of effectiveness of the Loan Agreement
for the Third Power Transmission Project (Loan 2338-YU) was the introduction
for each Borrower of increases in electricity tariffs of at least 15%, in real
terms, by January 1, 1984. A similar undertaking was made under the SAL I
Loan Agreement. Average tariffs in all republics and provinces were increased
by about 15% in real terms effective January 1, 1984 and increased by 30% on
October 1, 1984 and 33.5% on December 28, 1984. A comparison of the
preliminary estimates of economic cost of supply (revalued to January 1, 1985
prices) with tariffs as of January 1, 1985 in each republic and province,
which incorporate non-reimbursable consumer contributions, shows that the
average tariff for Yugoslavia is about 6.6 YD/kWh, which is 76% of the
estimated LRMC of about 8.6 YD/kWh. Average tariffs and the estimated LRMCs
in each republic and autonomous province are summarized below:

1/ Under Article 6 of the new law, prices of energy and energy raw materials
are to be set according to "common elements" to be established in federal
plan documents and enactments used for the formulation of economic policy
and in accordance with the levels of world prices.

1.09    The current tariff levels show substantial improvement over the
levels prevailing as of 1982 when the average tariff for Yugoslavia as a whole
was about 45% of estimated economic cost of supply. This is an indication of
the progress that has so far been made in bringing tariffs to levels of
economic cost since the signing of the Third Power Transmission Project Loan
Agreement in 1982. For the *verage tariff for Yugoslavia as a whole to reach
the level of economic cost of supply by December 31, 1987, average annual real
increases of about 9% in the average tariff would be required. The political
acceptability of future increases in electricity tariffs would depend to a
large extent on the ability of the Yugoslav authorities to control domestic
inflation.
1.10    Tariffs in Bosnia-Herzegovina are, on average, among the highest in
Yugoslavia. This is partly due to a surcharge levied on high voltage
consuners to account for the difference between the tariff and the cost of
imported electricity from abroad and household consumers for non-reimbursable
consuner contributions. The objective of tariffs achieving parity with the
economic cost of supply through gradual annual adjustments is being pursued
under the Third Power Transmission Project and the SAL, and only the tariffs
of EPBIH would be handled through the subject loan. 'While on the basis of
projections it is estimated that Bosnia-Herzegovina would be able to achieve
this objecti-ve by December 31, 1987, all other republics and provinces except
Slovenia have a nuch longer way to go to achieve the objective (see table in
para. 1.08).
Sector Development Strategy
1.11    In March 1983, the Federal Assembly adopted an economic program for
restructuring the economy prepared by the Stabilization Commission following
the balance of payments crisis of 1979. Since the energy sector was
considered critical to structural adjustment, the Stabilization Commission
formrulated a long-term strategy for its development. This strategy has two
major elements. first, expanding production from domestic energy resources,
particularly lignite, coal, hydroelectricity and existing petroleum fields,
and second, improving the efficiency of energy consumption, distribution and
transformation through demand management measures, mainly reforms in pricing.
The Bank has reviewed the Government's strategy through sector work in the
report "Constraints and Prospects for Restructuring the Energy Sector" (Report
4797-YU) May 1984. This report endorses the Government's strategy and makes
specific recommendations for the development of indigenous energy resources,
rationalization of investment programs to meet national objectives, changing
the basis and levels of energy prices and raising energy efficiency. As well
as furthering the Government's structural adjustment objectives, the strategy
outlined for the energy sector is itself dependent on general policies for
structural adjustment, especially measures aimed at improving financial
discipline and the allocation of foreign exchange which would assist in the
selection of priority projects and ensure that finance is available to
impl emen t th em.

B. The Power Subsector
Organ7iztion
1.12     The Yugoslavian power sector comprises power industries of six
republics and two autonomous provinces. The main power industry organizations
are Elektroprivreda Bosne i Hercegovine (EPBIH), Sarajevo, in the Socialistic
Republic (SR) of Bosna and Herzegovina, Elektroprivreda Crne-Gore, Nicsic in
the SR Montenegro, Zajednica Elektroprivrednih Organizacija Hratske (ZEOH),
Zagreb in the SR Croatia, Elektrostopanstvo Na Makedonija (ESM), Skopje in the
SR Macedonia, Elektrogospodarstro Slovenije (EGS), Maribor in the SR Slovenia,
Zdruzena Elektroprivreda (ZEP), Belgrade in SR Serbia, Elektroprivreda Kosova
(EPK), Pristina in the Socialistic Autonomous Province (SP) Kosovo, and
Elektrovojvodina (EV), Novi Sad in the SP Vojvodina_
1.13     Until 1965 the power subsector was highly centralized and federally
controlled, but adoption in that year of a policy of decentralization led to
fragmentation of the power subsector with an adverse effect on planning of
electric power generation and transmission development. A major consequence
of the lessened governmental role has been the growing difficulty of
coordinating investment among sectors and regions. In accordance with the
Electricity Act of 1965, the country's power industry was decentralized and
broadly separated into generation and transmissi-!distribution enterprises in
the republics and the provinces. All power enterprises became members of the
Union of Yugoslav Electric Power Industry (Zajednica Jugoslovenske
Elektroprivreda [JUGELI), responsible for overall coordination of planning and
operation of the interconnected system. However, with no executive authority
over its members, JUGEL had never been fully effective as a coordinating
authority until recent years of active Bank involvement in the development of
the subsector.
1.14     In 1974 a further reorganization occurred in the sector due to
constitutional changes. The electric power subsector is decentralized except
for the operation of the 400-kV interconnected system and the power exchange
activities with the neighboring countries, for which operating responsibility
lies with JUGEL. Responsibility for operating its own system and to meet the
local demand lies almost entirely with each individual republic or province.
Operating responsibility for the subsector is further subdivided within the
republics and Drovinces down to the level of the basic organization of
associated labor (BOAL). each of which is autonomous within its own sphere of
activity (a generating station, a section of transmission or subtransmission
line, etc.). These units can be integrated into Work Organizations of
Associated Labor (WOAL), and WOALs can be integrated into Composite
Organizations of Associated Labor (COAL) through self-management agreements.
All the existing WOALs and COALs are required by law to be members of JUGEL.
In accordance with the Federal Labor Law, Self-Managing Communities of
Interest (composed of an equal number of representatives of producers and
consumers) are also formed in the power subsector of each republic and
province (para. 2.01).



- 8-
1.15     JUGEL has no executive authority over its member organizations and
decision-making involves a complicated system of voting on important matters,
through conseasus. In the event of conflict between the least-cost operation
of the interconnected power system, and the financial interest of individual
BOALs, the least-cost objective is supposed to prevail. If there is a
fundamental disagreement among the republics and provinces on the future
s-upply of electricity, the Arbitration Department of JUGEL is required to
mediate. As an ultimate sanction, the Federal Executive Council reserves
powers to ensure the technological integrity of the Yugoslav power system
should self-management agreements required by law fail to be concluded or
should JUGEL fail to discharge its responsibilities.
1.16     The Bank, in the course of its various loans to the power subsector,
has advocated the strengthening of the role of JUGEL for the optimum
utilization of the sc-ace energy resources of the country, optimized operation
of the system generation, transmission and distribution capacity and the
achievement of country-wide objectives regarding planning, energy
conservation, tariffs at the interconnected system level and financing of
power facilities. At present, among other coordination activities long-range
country-wide development plans and interconnected system tariff adjustment
proposals and related coordination activities at the federal level are also
carried out by JUGEL.
1.17     In SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, EPBIE is by far the largest owner of
the Republic's power facilities (more than 92X) and comprises 16 WOALs
including Hidroelektrane Na Drini (HED), the executing agency of the project.
Detailed information regarding the power organi-ations in SR Bosnia and
Herzegovina is given in Chapter II and organization charts, Chart 1 and 2.
Existing Power Facilities
1.18     The total installed capacity in the public supply system of the
Yugoslav 'nterconnected grid at the end of 1983 was 16,950 MW of which 7,330
MW was hydro. In 1983, 67,054 GWh was produend from generation racilities in
Yugoslavia and also 1,055 GWh was purchased from the neighboring countries to
meet the demand for electrical energy. Yugoslavia has about 349,320 km of
transmissionldistribution lines operating at various voltages throughout the
country. Total distribution transformer capacity in service is about 80,380
MVA (excluding generation step-up substations). The total system losses (all
voltage levels) are about 18%, which is considered reasonable, bearing in mind
the existence of highly developed lower voltage (lower than 35-kV)
distribution system and the age and condition of the equipment. As these
losses increase power organizations install suitable system compensation
equipment and strengthen power distribution lines within their general
development program to reduce losses as far as economically possible.
Detailed information regarding the existing power facilities is given in
Annexe, 1 and 2 and shown on Map IBRD 18477 for Yugoslavid as a whole and on
Map IBRD 18478 for the SR Bosnia and Herzegovina.



1.19     The total installed capacity of the SR Bosnia and Herzegovina's power
system at the end of 1983 was 3,005 MW, of which 1,427 MW was hydro and total
production in 1983 was 11,527 GWh. About 2,239 GWh and 910 GWh was purchased
from the other RiPs and the neighboring countries respectively, while 2,823
GWh was delivered to the other RIPs, and 485 GWh exported to neighboring
countries; local consumption was 8,887 GWh. SR Bosnia and Rerzegovina has
about 84,170 km of transmission and distribution lines operating at various
voltages throughout the Republic. Total distribution transformer capacity in
service is about 14,240 MVA (excluding generation sLep-up substations). The
republic's power system losses is about 8% (excluding distribution) which is
considered reasonable.
Long-Range Power Development Program
1.20     The long-range power development program aims to base electricity
production on the economic development of indigenous hydro, lignite and brown
coal resources. During the period 1984-90 about 6,450 MW of new generating
plant is planned to be commissioned. Of this 1,500 MW is from 19 hydro
projects, the largest of which are Visegrad (315 IW), Zur (293 MW) and Djerdap
(216 MW). The remainder comprises about 10 thermal power projects which are
fueled almost entirely by lignite and brown coal. Major thermal projects
being implemented include Drnno (696 MW), Nikola Tesla II (618 MW), Kakanj V
(230 MW) and Ugljevik I & II (600 MW). For the period 1991-2000 JUGEL has
prepared a long term development program which involves the completion of 30
hydroelectric stations with a total capacity of 3,414 MW, 4,360 MW of lignite
capacity, 3,815 MW of brown coal and about 936 MW of oil fired capacity for
peaking and standby. The generation program is given in Annexes 13 and 14 and
silmmarized in the following table:

Previous Bank Lending in the Power Subsector
1.22     The Bank has a long-standing involvement in Yugoslavia's power
si±bsector development. The proposed loan would be the eighth Bank lending
operation (including one supplemental Loan) for power in Yugoslavia.  Two
loans (i.e., Loans 277-YU and 318-YU in 1961 and 1962, respectively, both for
US$30 million) were made to help finance two hydroelectric plants (the Senj
Sydroplant in Croatia and the Bajra Basta Hydrostation in Serbia) and
associated transmission facilities. These projects were satisfactorily
completed in 1969. The third and fourth loans (i.e., Loans 836-YU and 1469-YU
in 1972 and 1977, for US$75 million and US$80 million, respectively) were made
to help finance the development of a national interconnected power system.
Project completion reports for these projects indicated that the projects were
successfully completed but with some delays in 1977 and 1983. Although Bank
objectives were broadly achieved, institution building had not been fully
successful. The fifth and sixth lending operations are related to development
of the Middle Neretva River in Bosnia and Herzegovina, i.e., Loan 1561-xU in
1968 for US$73 million (Tranche I), followed by a supplemental Loan 1561-l-YU
in 1983 for US$61 million (Tranche II). Tranche I1 is the construction of
Mostar dam which was originally included in the project description but not in
the Bank-financed portion.  The project financed by Tranche I was successfully
completed in 1983 within the original construction schedule and the estimated
cost. The project financed by Tranche II is scheduled for completion in
1988. The last and on-going Tnird Power Transmission Project, which was made
in 1983 for US$120 million (Loan 2338-YU), will finance a complete energy
management system to operate the country-wide interconnected system in the
most efficient manner and provide more comprehensive and systematic data for
management and planning the development of the power system.
1.23     Particularly during the last ten years after diversification of the
power subsector (para. 1.14), the Bank has concentrated its efforts to help
establish a reasonably sophisticated but easily implementable country-wide
planning methodology together with construction of a strong 400-kV national
interconnected power system covering the entire country and to support
strengthening of the central power organization (JUGEL) to fully coordinate
all power development authorities in the republics and provinces. The Bank's
and JUGEL's cooperative efforts have achieved some degree of success,
particularly in the areas of overall 'Long-range power development planning and
the adoption of energy tariffs by the power organizations.

II. PROJECT ORGANIZATION
Organization and Legal Aspects
2.01     There are two main organizations in the Republic's power subsector,
EPBIH, Sarajevo, the borrower, and the Self-Managing Community of Interest of
Elektroprivreda Bosne I Hercegovine (SIZEL),"v Sarajevo. EPBIR is a power
operations organization, mainly responsible for production (i.e.,
construction, operation, and maintenance of power facilities). SIZEL,
composed of representatives of power producers and consumers, is mainly
responsible for the coordination of plans for generation and transmission
throughout the Republic and Federal level and financing of power programs.
SIZEL coordinates plans for generation and transmission at a country-wide
level through JUGEL, Belgrade. Organization charts of EPBIH and SIZEL are
submitted as Charts 1 and 2.
2.02     EPBIE is a Composite organization of Associated Labor (COAL) composed
of 16 Work Organizations of Associated Labor (WOAL) of which three are under
formation (i.e. executing agencies having no assets and liabilities) including
Hidroelectrane na Drini (HED), executing agency of the project and the
developer of the Drina River hydro potential. The 13 fully-formed Work
Organizations consist of three hidroelektrane (hydropower plant
organizations), two termoelektrane (thermal power plant organizations), one
elektroprenos (power transmission organizations) and seven power distribution
organizations. The work organizations under formation are Hidroelektrane na
Drini, Rudnik I Termoelektrana Ugljevik (coal mine and thermal power plant)
and Rudnik I Termoelektrana Gacko (coal mine and thermal power plant).  After
completion of Ugljevik and Gacko thermal power plants, these work
organizations under formation will establish the new Basic Organizations of
Associated Labor (BOALs) for the operation of respective power plants which
will be accountable to the respective WOALs. The 13 fully-formed WOALs have
96 BOALs in total, plus 18 common service organizations (such as power plants
and transmission maintenance organizations, common administrative service
organizations, technical institutes, etc., in the WOALs). The total number of
employees of EPBIH and its WOALs is about 13,000. EPBIH, as a COAL, has a
Workers' Council, a President, a Management Committee, and three common
service organizations at the headquarters in Sarajevo, an administrative
department, the Institute and the Internal Bank. EPBJH is controlled by the
Workers' Council and the President who, appointed by the Council for a period
of 4 years (which may be renewed), is the legal representative of the COAL.
2.03     EPBIH was established under a self-management agreement enacted by
all power industry organizations in the Republic on March 29, 1977, within the
framework of the Yugoslav constitution and Federal Labor Law. EPBIH's
statute, dated September 29, 1977, states that the main responsibilities of
EPEIR, among other things, are as follow:
1/ SIZEL = Samoupravna Interesna Zajednica Elektroprivrede
Bosne i Hercegovine.



- 13 -
(i) preparation of major power development programs for the Republic;
(ii) pooling of all free funds to be used for capital expenditure in
the power subsector;
(iii) determination of the annual and long-term power balance;
(iv) collection and distribution of revenues to its work
organizations on the basis of self-management agreements; and
(v) determination of detailed electricity tiriffs for the purchase
and sale of power on the basis of tariff levels set by the
Federal Community for Pricing (FCP) for various voltage levels.
2.04     Although EPBIH will be the borrower, the project w_il be executed by
HED.  ED, which was originally founded by Elektroprenos Sarajevo in 1973 to
supervise the planning and construction of hydropower plants on the Drina
River, was transferred to EPBIH in 1974. HED is not yet a BOAL because it has
no assets or income and it is a Work Organization under formation. After
completion of the Visegrad Hydroelectric Project, a new organization of
associated labor will be set up for the operation of the project, which will
be accountable to HED (para. 2.02).  HE] will continue to be responsible for
the construction of other new projects on the Drina River to develop the Drina
basin. HED, at present, has about 70 employees consisting of professionals
and supporting staff which wiLl be about doubled during the peak construction
period in 1986. EPBIH and HE] have no difficulties in recruiting
professionals and support staff as needed.  It was agreed during loan
negotiations of the proposed project that HE] will form the new organization
of associated labor for the operation of the project. The organization chart
of HED is given as Chart 3.

III. THE PROJECT
Objectives and Rationale for Bank Financing
3.01     One of the main aims agreed by the authorities for the subsector is
to reduce the country's heavy dependence on imported oil through the
development of indigenous renewable energy resources. The main project
objective is to further this aim through developing indigenous hydro resources
to assure a firm source of reliable electric generating capacity -to meet the
growth in electricity demand. The project would also create new job
opportunities - particularly during its construction period. Further
objectives would be the establishment oE an improved accounting system and a
comprehensive training program which would cover, inter alia, the preparation
of financial projections, financial planning and financial analysis and
systpmatic reporting (information system) (para. 4.03). Moreover, the project
would provide a strong project supervision/monitoring system (paras 3.16 and
3.18).
Proiect Description
3.02     The project consists of:
(a)  construction of a concrete gravity dam (height - 52 m, length -
270 m) on the Drina River to form a reservoir with a storage
capacity of about 160 million m3 and 8.5 km2 surface area, a
power house with three 105-MW hydro turbine-generator units with
a short water intake and outlet structure with the main and
auxiliary gates;
(b)  construction of a 400-kV step-up transformer bank (315 MW) to
connect the power plant to the interconnected power grid by a
400-kV transmission line (about 5.4 km), relocation of about 40
kms of roads and resettlement of about 225 families; and
(c)  consultancy services for construction supervision, a training
program for the staff of the borrower and HED in financial
management to set up an adequate management information system,
and a panel of experts to advise on civil works.
3.03     The proposed Visegrad Hydroelectric Project will be located on the
Drina River about 2.7 km upstream from the historical bridge on the Drina in
the suburb of rJusce near Visegrad in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The project will be a mid-merit station (peaking and base plant) with an
average plant load factor of 44X and annual generation of 1,200 GWh p.a. The
Drina River, with two major tributaries, the Piva and Tara rivers, is one of
the most impo-tant inter-republic (Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and
Montenegro) hydro resources of Yugoslavia.  Its hydro potential, flood, and
irrigation aspects have been studied thoroughly. Although 29 hydroelectric



- 15 -
project sites in cascade have been identified on the Drina, so Ear only six of
these have been constructed (Annex 3). Preparation of the remaining projects
along the Drina River is under way or completed. Studies for the Buk Bijela
Hydroelectric Project (450-MW), one of the cascade hydroprojects on the Piva
River, were completed in 1974. On the basis thereof the project was appraised
by the Bank in 1975 and a loan of US$70.0 million was approved in 1975.
However, the loan agreement was never signed because the Bank's borrower,
Elektroprivreda Bosne i Hercegovine (EPBIH), was unable to reach an agreement
with the Republics of Serbia and Montenegro regarding use of the water of the
inter-republican Rivers of Piva, Tara and Drina. Although an agreement
concerning the joint use of the water has now been completed, a comprehensive
long-range power development study for Yugoslavia carried out by JUGEL and
Boris Kidric Institute of Nuclear Sciences of Belgrade, with Bank help and
using the WASP program package of the International Atomic Energy Agency, has
now established that the Visegrad Project has a high priority as part of the
national least-cost program. The study concluded that the Visegrad project
should be completed in 1989 and Buk Bijela in 1991, after completion of some
base thermal power plant units (600 MW in total) and some other hydro plants
(230 MW in total). A detailed project description is given in Annex 3.
3.04     EPBIH and HED signed the main civil works contract with Hidrogradnja
of Sarajevo in 1984, and construction of the civil works are progressing
satisfactorily (para. 3.10). Hidrogradnja is a capable international
contractor which has constructed many overseas projects (mostly in Africa and
the Middle East), almost all the previous Bank-financed hydro projects in
Yugoslavia and is now also constructing the Mostar Dam financed by the Bank
under Loan L56L-YU (Middle Neretva Hydroelectric Project). The Visegrad
hydroelectric project's first and second units will be operational in end-1988
and the last in early 1989.
Cost Estimates
3.05     The total project cost including interest during construction is
estimated to be about YD 103 billion (US$284.3 million), of which 51%,
amounting to YD 53 billion (US$151.4 million), is in foreign exchange. A
suIImiary of the cost estimate for the principal components of the project is
shown below and a detailed estimate is given in Annex 4.

Note:  1.  Ancillary works include costs of site preparation and construction
camps, construction and relocation of roads, compensation,
acquisition, bush clearing and relocation of population.
2.  Physical contingencies of about 15% were added to the civil works
items in view of the uncertainty of the actual conditions which
would be encountered during the course of construction and the
possibility of increased quantities of excavation and grouting.
Physical contingencies of about 5% were added to the equipment and
engineering contracts to allow for unexpected changes in
requirements. Local costs include identifiable duties and taxes
estimated to be about YD 3,670 million (US$5.0 million).
3. Price contingencies were added to the base cost plus physical
contingencies as follows:

3.06     The original cost estimates were prepared by HED and its consultants
(ENERGOINVEST of Sarajevo) on the basis of December 1983 prices. During the
appraisal they were revised based on bid prices received for the main civil
works in 1984 and adjusted by the mission for January 1985 prices and
increased physical contingencies after careful review of the design by the
mission members. Average cost per kW installed, excluding training,
transmission line, and interest during construction, is almost $757. KW
installed cost, including interest during construction, is about $902, which
is reasonable for this type and design of the project.
Proiect Financing
3.07     The total foreign funding required is US$151.4 million including
US$27.4 million interest charges and about US$26.5 million indirect foreign
exchange costs of which about US$13.4 million for hydromechanical equipment
which vill be provided by local suppliers (para. 3.10). Total contract costs
eligible for Bank financing are estimated at about US$97.6 million. The
proposed Bank loan (US$125 milliion) would finance materials and equipment for
the construction of the project and interest during construction on the Bank
loan. It is 'stimated that retroactive financing of up to US$8 million would
be needed ta flnance advance payments on Bank-financed contracts.  On the
above basis, the proposed Bank loan (US$125 million) would finance about 44%
of the estimated financing requirement (US$284.3 million) and about 83X of the
estimated fo::eign component (US$151.4 million) of the project. Local costs
will be finarnced by EPBIH's internal cash generation, consumers' contribution,
Federal funds for less developed regions and local banks. Details of
financing of EPBIH's investment program (1983-1990) are given in Chapter IV
and the estimated financing plan for the project is shown below:

a/ Includes indirect foreign financing equivalent to about YD 9 billion
(about US$26.5 million).
3.08     The indicated and/or committed funds from domestic sources are about
ID 59 billion of which YD 19 billion were approved (as of March 1984 based on
December 1983 prices) by self-management agreements of workers' council of
EPBIH, assembly of Self-Managing Community of Interest and the Chamber of
Commerce of BIR. It is also indicated in the self-management agreement that
the project cost will be reviewed on a yearly basis to allocate sufficient
funds to cover project cost increases including price escalation. Therefore,
the difference in domestic financing YD 40 billion, which corresponds to
contingencies and interest charges, will be financed through reviews of
construction costs for corresponding appropriations (in March every year) as a
mandatory exercise of the Republic's financing system for work organizations'
investment programs (para. 4.14). To ensure local funds as and when necessary
and to avoid loan processing delays similar to those under the Third Power
Transmission Project (Loan 2338-YU), it was agreed during the negotiations,
that the Self-Managing Community of Interest will take steps necessary to
cover any shortfall of funds for the construction for the Visegrad
Hydroelectric Project including cost increases (due to price escalation and
other reasons). EPBIH and HED have completed the financing plan and the
contracts were signed between RED and Basic Banks for financing the Visegrad
project.

Procurement
3.09     The major procurement packages can be classified in four major groups:
(i) Civil Works: (a) construction of the dam and powerhouse;
(b) ancillary works; (c) supply of low heat cement; (d) supply
of structural steel; and (e) construction machinery;
(ii)  Hydromechanical Equipment:  (a) gates for bottom outlet; (b)
water inlet gates; (c) tailrace gates; and (d) spillway gates;
(iii)  Electromechanical Equipment:  (a) turbines; (b) generators; (c)
transformers; (d) powerhouse cranes; (e) 400-kV switchgear; (f)
hyuraulic measuring instruments; (g) control and coxmmication
equipment; (h) cables; (i) station auxiliary supply systems; and
(j) low-voltage switchgear; and
(iv) Transmission Line: 5.4 km of 400-kV power line between the
Visegrad powerhouse and the under construction 400-kV Visegrad
substation.
3.10     No Bank financing is envisaged for Items (i)(a) and (b), (ii) and
(iv) above. The contract related to construction of the dam and powerhouse
(item (i)(a) above) was awarded to Hidrogradnja of Sarajevo in July, 1984
following local competitive bidding for which five bids were received. Item
(i) (b) will be constructed by various local contractors on the basis of local
competitive bidding. The bid documents related to Item (ii) above were issued
on the basis of local competitive bidding, and contracts awarded to local
firms. Item (iv) is a very short power line. Construction of the line will
not be attractive for the foreign contractors, therefore it will be procured
through local competitive bidding.
3.11     Bank financing is proposed for Item (i)(c),(d) and (e) and Item (iii)
above. All materials and equipment to be financed by the Bank will be
procured under ICB in accordance with the Bank Guidelines for Procurement.
Yugoslavia is a net importer of cement and steel and foreign firms are
expected to win the contracts for construction equipment, based on the results
of recent bids for similar equipment on the Mostar Project. The full cost for
these components has therefore been treated as foreign cost. All contracts of
$100,000 or more will be subject to prior Bank review. There is at present a
very strong competition in the world markets for the supply of
electromechanical equipment. Therefore, it is difficult to make a forecast
regarding the possible outcome of the bidding process. The above estimate of
the foreign cost of the project is based on the assumption that all contracts
for electromechanical equipment would be won by foreign suppliers.
3.12     Apart from the main engineering consultant, ENERGOINVEST of Sarajevo
and Belgrade, there are eleven engineering consultancy organizations involved
in carrying out various specific engineering works (paras 3.16 and 3.17). As



- 20 -
no significant foreign exchange will be involved and most of the contracts
have already been signed with local institutions based on negotiations, fixed
prices or a percentage of the costs of relevant project's components or
individual works, no Bank financing of engineering services are envisaged.
3.13     Procurement arrangements are summarized in the table below.

Disbursement
3.14     The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed over five years
(1985-1989) on the following basis:
(a) 100% of foreign or ex-factory costs of material and equipment
including expenditure eligible for retroactive financing (para.
3.07); and
(b) interest during construction on the Bank loan.



- 21 -
3.15     The disbursement schedule (Annex 5) closely approximates to the Bank
standard disbursement for regional power projects. The disbursement schedule
was thoroughly reviewed with the borrower during negotiations and it was
agreed that it is realistic bearing in mind the very advanced state of
procurement, site preparation, preliminary works for river diversion and
resett'ement of families to be affected by the reservoir.  There are no
additional local formalities left to be completed for approval and/or
financing of the project by local authorities, and there are no specific
conditions for loan effectiveness. The closing date for the loan would be
December 31, 1989. Since this project will involve a number of relatively
small payments and to facilitate disbursements, a US$4 million equivalant
"special account" would be established and use of statements of expenditures
permitted.
Project Implementation and Engineering Consultants' Services
3.16     The project will be implemented by EED under the guidance of EPBIE
with the help of engineering consultants and the "panel of experts". The
project construction schedule (Chart 4) is based on a project construction
period of 55 months and a target in-service date for all three units of
February 1989.
3.17     The main engineering consultant of the project is ENERGOLNVEST of
Sarajevo, an internationally acknowledged, capable Yugoslav engineering
consultant/constructor. Under the guidance of ENERGOINVEST and MED, eleven
engineering consultants also contributed to project preparation and/or designs
for road relocations, quantity checking and design review, ecol,.gical aspects,
riodel tests, seismic investigations, siltation, mapping, geology, etc. The
design specifications, geological and seismic conditions, construction methods
and the schedule have also been reviewed by two independent Bank consultants.
NERCGOINVEST will also carry out Project's management, coordination and
supervision of construction with the help of MED's staff. During
negotiations, EPBIH and MM agreed to employ a panel of experts acceptable to
the Bank to provide independent review of the civil works' construction and
report to EEBIH and fED on the stability and safety of the structures during
the construction period of the project. During negotiations, EPBIH and HED
also agreed that during the project's operation the dam, waterways,
earthworks, and reservoir banks and their appurtenant structures will be
periodically inspected at intervals of not less than one year and in
accordance with appropriate engineering practice in order to determine any
deficiencies in the operation conditions of the structures or in the quality
and adequacy of maintenance methods which may endanger the safety of the
structures. The first comprehensive inspection will be carried out by the
proposed panel of experts immediately prior to the filling of the reservoir.
Monitoring and Evaluation
3.18     During negotiations the reports and records necessary to monitor
progress of the project and its evaluation on completion were agreed.
Proposed guidelines for a project monitoring system are given in Annex 9. On
completion of the project EPBIH and BED will prepare a project completion
report based on an outline agreed with the Bank.



- 22 -
Environment
3.19     An environmental study was carried out by EPBIE's consultants
covering the entire Drina Basin, particularly the project. These studies have
indicated that for the most part the impact of the project on the environment
will be small as the reservoir is relatively small and contained almost
entirely in the present canyon bed, there is little habitation, cultivation
and buildings, no water-related diseases, and major historical sites are to be
protected. At present, water pollution caused by existing town and industrial
factories is not yet excessive. Although the present water pollution from
factories has not yet caused major problems, once the dam is closed the
present pollution and sediment (from industry) as well as increasing numbers
of factories present a significant potential threat to water quality, and
industrial sludge deposits from (particularly from the "Unis Azot" factory) on
the cooling coils and elsewhere. The issue is under review by local Yugoslav
authorities. Results of the studies and recommendations will be examined by
the Bank, and necessary pollution control measures will be implemented prior
to dam closure. The majority of families affected by the reservoir are being
relocated in two major cities (Sarajevo and Visegrad) in accordance with the
local regulations and the preference of the families. A small number of
families whose premises will be inundated in the town of Mededa preferred to
stay in their original area. HED will soon complete new houses at the higher
levels outside the reservoir based on the plans approved by the local
authorities and accepted by the families for their resettlement. Detailed
information regarding ecology is given in Annex 3.

IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Accounting System
4.01     The primary accounting activities of each workers organization are
performed within the organization itself. Periodically, the financial
information is communicated to two departments of the composite organization,
the work commiunity of common services and the internal bank. The latter is in
charge of a number of activities involving the composite organization as a
whole such as allocating pooled funds and government funds for expansion. It
also acts as an intermediary between the workers organizations and their
business partners and establishes annual and mid-term financial plans in
collaboration with the technical departments.
4.02     However, these functions are not coordinated within a single finance
department and a single authority, and the relationship between the composite
and the basic organizations is loose and hampered by a lack of regular
communication and of qualified personnel. EPBIH's information system is
deficient and present and future data about investment, financing,
receivables, etc., are not readily available. During the appraisal of the
present project, EPBIR managed to provide the data and information required by
the Bank mission but not without considerable effort.
4.03     Clearly, EPBIH needs to make considerable progress towards
establishing an efficient wanagement information system and agreed, during
discussions, to request external help. Given the considerable expertise of
SDK (para. 4.04) and its familiarity with EPBIH accounts, a satisfactory
solution, and certainly the least-cost one, would be for SDK to provide such
help. SDK is prepared to assign for this purpose for a period of two years a
team composed of one senior and two junior officers whose task will be to
review the existing procedures of EPBIH, to identify its problem areas and to
design an efficient accounting and planning system (including internal
control) suitable for management purposes. In addition, it will train EPBIR
personnel and introduce a moderate amount of computer software. The team will
be working on an advisory basis and will be reporting directly to the EPBIH
general manager. During negotiations, EPBIH agreed to appoint SDK by September
30, 1985, under terms of reference agreed with SDK and the Bank, to conduct
such a review and to recommend an adequate management information system by
September 30, 1987. Recommended terms of reference for the proposed training
program is given in Annex 6. EPBIE also agreed to consult with the Bank on
the recommendations and to implement an appropriate system by June 30, 1988
after discussions with the Bank on the implementation program by January 31,
1988.
Audit
4.04     Under the loan agreement for Loan 2338-YU (Section 5.02), annual
audits of the accounts of EPBIH are to be carried out by the Social Accounting
Service (SDK) or another competent auditing organization acceptable to the
Bank, and the audited accounts and audit report are to be furnished to the
Bank within nine months of the close of the year. In practice, the Special



- 24 -
Audit Group of SDK, which was established at the instance of the Bank in 1974
and which has developed, with the Bank's help, expertise to carry out audits
to international standards, carries out these audits. in addition to an audit
of the production and transmission organizations, the audit includes an audit
of the distribution organization and an audit of all work organizations under
formation. The existing audit arrangements are satisfactory and should be
continued. During negotiations, EPBIH agreed to the sam audit covenant being
repeated in the proposed loan agreements. In addition, HED and EPBIR agreed
to a separate audit being carried out for HED and submitted to the BaIn  under
the same conditions.
4.05     A number of recurrent qualifications have appeared in EPBIR audit
reports in recent years. While some of them can only be removed in the
context of a more general and lengthy reorganization of the accounting system,
others (concerning the understatement of the foreign currency loans and
deferred payables and fixed assets at balance sheet date, and of the cost of
electricity received through exchange in kind) could be removed more readily
if the Basic Organizations took the necessary action. EPBIH is aware of the
importance of these qualifications so far as the accuracy of the financial
statements is concerned. During negotiations, EPBIH agreed to take action to
remove from the 1982 audit report by December 31, 1985, the qualifications
concerning the understatement of the foreign currency loans and deferred
payables and fixed assets at balance sheet date, and of the accounting for
electricity received through exchange in kind.
Tariffs
4.06     EPBIH's tariff policy requires that sales revenues should cover
operating expenses, including interest charged to operations, and leave a
small surplus on operations (net income). In general, the major investments
are financed out of loans, depreciation, and revenues from other sources (some
but not all of which are related to electricity sales) such as levies and
surcharges on electricity consumers and connection charges. All power sector
investments, and the corresponding sources of finance, have to be approved by
the republican Self-Managing Comwnnity of Interest (producer and consumer
assembly - SIZEL), government and parliamentary assemblies, both project by
project and as part of the annual and 5-year planning process. Moreover,
tariff levels for 1984 and 1985 are subject to temporary price controls and
Federal approval as part of the emergency measures taken in connection with
the economic stabilization program of Yugoslavia. The decisions on tariff and
investment financing policy and on the extent of tariff increases are thus, £.n
effect, largely outside the control of the work organizations, the main
responsibility lying with SIZEL and the federal authorities. Tariffs are,
nevertheless, under continuous review and and adjusted at least once a year to
allow for cost increazes.
4.07     The detailed electricity tariff structure for EPBIH at the beginning
of 1984 is shown in Annex 8. There have been numerous tariff increases in the
past four years. A 30Z overall tariff increase in April 1981 was followed by
increases of 18% in April 1982, 25% in March 1983 and 36Z in December 1983.



- 25 -
As a result, the overall tariffs doubled between May 1981 and December 1983
while the price index rose 2.2 times. Also, starting in 1984, the higher
winter tariff was extended to the summer period and an exceptional surcharge
was added to the direct consumers' bill (large industrial plants) to
compensate for the additional cost of importing electricity from outside the
country. Finally, a 30% tariff increase was made effective October, 1, 1984
and another (33.5% on average) on December 29, 1984. These tariff increases
have made the tariffs in Bosnia, on average, among the highest in Yugoslavia
(para. 1.08). The average tariff in Bosnia is about 92% of LRMC.
Consumers' Contributions
4.08     Part of EPBIH's construction program is also financed by
non-reimbursable and reimbursable contributions from consumers.
Non-reimbursable consumers' contributions (10% of the electricity bill of
household consumers) will be paid by consumers, starting in January 1985.
Considering its financing requirements, it is assumed that it would be
possible for EPBIH to reduce reimbursable consumers' contributions by 40% in
1987, 80% in 1988 and Lo discontinue them entirely after 1988, and to phase
out non-reimbursable contributions almost entirely beginning in 1989. Under
the accounting procedures followed by EPBIH, non-reimbursable contributions
are not treated as revenues but are treated as direct credits to the Business
Fund. An alternative would be to treat them as revenues since they are a levy
based on electricity consumption and in effect a tariff increase, clearly
intended to augment EPBIHts financial resources. The projections follow the
accounting procedures of EPBIR. Reimbursable contributions, repayable over 15
years from 1991 at 6% interest, are divided into two categories:
(a) A contribution on the yearly investment in fixed assets of
certain consumers, which was increased in October 1983 from 2%
to 4% of such yearly investment; and
(b) a contribution based on energy consumption.
The contributions based on energy consumption is levied at two different rates
as given below:
(a) to be paid by certain consumers at a rate which was increased in
October 1983 from 15 paras/kWh to 12% of the energy bill; and
(b)  to be paid by other consumers, such as public lighting,
transportation enterprises, private shops and hospitals, at a
rate increased in October 1983 from 15 paras/kWh to 10% of the
energy bill.
Since the contributions are related to the energy bill, any future tariff
increase will also automatically increase the consumer contributions. The
effect of the above increases is that reimbursable contributions are expected
to triple from 1983 to 1984. Also, the 6% interest rate payable on these
contributions is much lower than the present commercial bank interest rate of



- 26 -
24Z in 1984 and thus the contributions represent a real resource available to
the power entity.  Any increase in the comuercial bank interest rate in future
will correspondingly increase the level of this resource. Clearly, because of
the interest rate differential, the reimbursable contributions have the aspect
of tariffs and should be taken into account, as appropriate, while calculating
whether tariffs (including consumer contributions) equal LRMC. This, however,
has not been done in the comparison of tariffs to LRMC (para. 1.08).  Only the
non-reimbursable consumer contributions were taken into consideration. The
matter would need further study.
Past Performance and Present Position
4.09     Under the loan agreement for Loan 1469-YU of 1977 for the Second
Transmission Project and Loan 1561-YU of 1979 for the Middle Neretva Project,
EPBIH was to attain an annual net cash generation equal to 35X of its
investment in power facilities during each year. The cash generation would
include non-repayable consumer contributions (including special taxes and
other levies) related to the sale of electricity and intended for the
expansion of power facilities; shortfalls in cash generation in one year could
be compensated by overruns in the previous year or following year.
4.10     The financial situation of EPBIH deteriorated from 1981 to 1983
because of factors involving both the general economic condition of the
country and the specific situation of the organization during this period.
Tariffs were not raised enough to keep pace with sharply increased costs
arising both from the high inflation in the country and from operational
reasons such as a continuing lack of water in the three successive years as a
result of a drought.   To compensate for the reduced hydro generation, EPBIH
had to increase expensive power imports from other republics and from outside
the country, and to make greater use of less efficient power plants, thus
incurring significantly higher fuel costs. Even then, because of delays in
the construction of large thermal power plants (Gacko and Ugljevic), the
energy deficit could not be entirely offset and EPBIH had to adopt a load
shedding program which reduced the energy sales. As a result, the net income
of EPBIR after interest decreased from YD 1.3 billion in 1981 to a loss of
YD 0.6 billion in 1982 and a loss of YD 3.4 billion in 1983. The net internal
cash generation became negative in 1982 and 1983.
4.11     During the negotiations of Loan 2338-YU and a supplemental loan to
Loan 1561-YU, government representatives confirmed that Government intended to
bring electricity prices in line with economic costs within a period of 4-5
years. To reflect this objective, the cash generation requirement was
replaced by a provision which stipulates that the electricity tariff (sales
prices, including connection charges and non-reimbursable consumer
contributions for the construction of fixed assets in the form of a surcharge
of 10% of the electricity bill for households) will be increased by annual
adjustments over a five-year period ending December 31, 1987 to a level of not
less than the average long-run marginal cost of supply of electricity. Since
this requirement would ensure tariffs being set at economic levels in due
course and would result in the required financial viability of EPBIH and an
adequate level of self-financing of expansion, EPBIH agreed during
negotiations to the same covenant.

Revaluation of Fixed Assets
4.12     Under Yugoslav law, fixed assets are revalued in any year in which
inflation has reached 10 or more since the last revaluation. Both fixed
assets in service and work in progress (when commissioned) are revalued as is
also depreciation using local inflation rates, and the revaluation surplus is
added to the Business Fund (equity). Yet, another adjustment in fixed asset
values is made arising out of devaluation of the Yugoslav dinar under
procedures agreed with SDK. The outstanding foreign debt at the end of each
year is revalued using the exchange rate at that date, and the corresponding
adjustment is included in fixed assets as a separate part of the fixed assets,
the acquisition of which was financed by the debt. The amounts as segregated
are not revalued again as part of fixed assets and are written off through
depreciation charges over the life of the assets. In effect, this procedure
is tantamount to deferring the foreign exchange differences arising from the
revaluation of the foreign loans for recognition in future periods. Hovever,
since the fixcd assets acquired through such debt are also revalued using
local inflation rates, the accounting procedures being used involve some
double counting which affect the rate of return on revalued assets and the
debt/equity ratio. The accounting procedures for revaluation of foreign debt
also do not appear to conform with recommended international accounting
standards. Appropriateness of these procedures is under review by the Bank
and SDK.

- 29 -
The table shows that 522 of the funds required during the construction period
are expected to be provided from internal sources, cash generation excluding
consumer contributions, 42 from non-reimbursable consumers contributions, 1%
from domestic partners' investment funds and the remaining 43Z from bcrrowing
(including 9X from reimbursable consumer contributions). All the sources of
financing are firmly identified.
4.14     As in the rest of Yugoslavia, the investment decisions in
Bosnia-Herzegovina are generally taken in the context of the five-year
development plan of the Government. Thus, the 1981-85 plan will be followed
by the 1986-90 one. However, in the case of EPBIH only, these two five-year
plans have been combined into a single one covering the 1983-90 period, to
allow for the inclusion of the whole span of the EPBIH program. The contents
of this plan will be integrated in 1985 into the Republic's overall five-year
development plan. Although the investment related to 'continuing works'
(those which will provide generation after 1990) are taken into consideration
in the financial forecasts of this report, the legal formalities regarding
their inclusion in EPBIf's program will be completed during the revision of
the plan in March 1985 (para. 3.08). The present 1983-90 plan was approved by
the Republican Assembly in July 1983. The second step required for an
investment decision is for the various parties involved to conclude
self-management agreements for pooling, allocating and utilizing the required
funds. Such agreements determine the timing, extent and specifics of the
contributions of the parties, in this case, EPBIH, the Community of Interests
and the Bosnia Chamber of Commerce (for commercial banks). These agreements
were completed in 1983. Thirdly, EPBIH's Workers Council takes a series of
decisions, separately approving the overall construction program, any specific
project (here the Visegrad project) and the allocation of funds for the
project.  These decisions were taken in 1983.   Finally, on the basis of the
self-management agreements and of the Workers' Council decisions, separate
agreements are concluded by the basic organization in charge of the project
(here Hidroelektrane na Drini) with the various contributors: EPBIH through
its internal bank, the Community of Interest also through the internal bank,
and the basic banks of the Republic (for commercial lending and for allocation
of Government funds). To ensure that the appropriate framework exists for the
implementation of the project, EPBIH submited ta the Bank the above-mentioned
agreements, duly executed. During negotiations, EPBIH also agreed to exchange
views with the Bank before making any changes to the 1985-90 investment
pxogram of the borrower which would result in cost variation in excess of
US$20 million Dinars equivalent.
4.15     The available sources of financing the project are:
(a) the internal cash generation of EPBIX which comprises the free
funds of the basic organizations, collected and pooled by EPBIH;
(b) the non-repayable consumers' contributions (including connection
charges);
(c) the repayable consumers' contributions;



- 30 -
(d) the Fund for underdeveloped regions, a national fund financed by
the contributions of all producers (including EPBIH) in the form
of borrowing, which relends its resources within a five-year
plan to the republics for specific investment projects (repaid
over 15 years, 7.5Z interest); and
(e) the commercial banks: the maximum amount to be borrowed for
local borrowing is determined in constant June 1982 prices by
the self-management agreement on pooling of bank funds and
properly indexed on past inflation. Since 1984, however, and in
agreement with the International Monetary Fund interest rates on
future debt are variable and indexed on inflation (241 at
mid-1984). Moreover, taking into account Yugoslavia's financial
situation, the whole foreign component of the project will have
to be borrowed, through commercial banks, at interest rates
computed in foreign currencies and then converted into dinars.
Future Financial Performance
4.16     The financial forecasts 1984-90 are presented in Annex 6 together
with the assumptions on which these forecasts are based. The projections
include the latest tariff increase (30% from October 1, 1984) and a further
35X overall increase has been assumed effective January 1985 to compensate for
the balance of the 1984 inflation. After January 1985, the tariffs have been
assumed to increase every six months by !,alf of the index otherwise used in
the projections (452 in 1985, 30X in 1986 and 25% afterwards) for the previous
six months. The projections assume discontinuance of the temporary surcharge
(to compensate for imports from outside the country) from 1986 when the only
imports are expected to come from other republics. The net effect of these
projected tariff changes are real tariff increases of about 14Z in 1985 and 5X
in each of 1986 and 1987, sufficient to increase the average tariff level in
Bosnia to equal LRMC by December 1987.
4.17     Under these assumptions, the financial situation of EPBIH is expected
to improve steadily during the period 1984 to 1990. The main factors are:
(a) an increase in production (by 64X from 1983 to 1990) because of
the commissioning of new plants (Gacka and Ugjevic in 1984-85),
Kakanj in 1986, Mostar in 1986/87, Ugjevic II in 1988 and
Visegrad in 1989;
(b) a decrease in electricity purchases from 1986 to 1988, after
which they are assumed to disappear; and
(c) an increase in the total amount of consumers' contributions
during the period through 1986 because of their indexation on
the electricity bill. The financing requirements would permit
their reduction by 40% in 1987 and 802 in 1988 and total
discontinuance from 1989, when local bank borrowing will not be
needed either.



- 31 -
4.18     The forecasts show a rate of return on assets as revalued in
accordance with the Yugoslav procedures, rising from 1.1% in 1983 to 4.9% in
1986 and 10.4% in 1990. The contribution-to-investment ratio, including the
changes in working capital and the revaluation of foreign loans, is estimated
to increase from 12 in 1984 to 192 in 1985, 38Z in 1987 and 64% in 1990. The
debt service coverage is estimated to increase from 0.9 in 1983 to 1.6 in
1984, 2.1 in 1987 and 3.7 in 1990. The debt/equity ratio is estimated to
improve from 40/60 in 1983 to 18/82.
Insurance
4.19     Insurance arrangements are made by the electric power organizations
on the basis of long-term agreements which are generally for a duration of
10 years. The risks covered generally are as follows:
(a) boiler explosion;
(b) fire (gereral and electrical);
(c) breakage and breakdown of plant and equipment;
(d) glass breakage, burglary, motor vehicle accidents;
(e) workers' compensation;
(f) domestic and international transport.
Assets under construction are insured by the contractors. These insurance
arrangements are satisfactory.

V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
ElectricitY Demand
5.01     Total consumption of electricity in Yugoslavia grew at average annual
rates of 9.11 during the period 1970-75 and 8.5X during 1975-80. Since 1980,
the annual growth rate of consumption has decreased to about 51 p.a. as a
result of the slowdown in economic activity and increases in electricity
prices. Roughly 60Z of electricity is consumed by industry and 321 by
households.
5.02     The Federal authorities prepare projections of energy and electricity
consumption based upon projections of economic growth. Energy and electricity
forecasts were reviewed by energy sector missions and the appraisal mission
and were found to be acceptable. During the periods 1970-75 and 1975-80 GDP
(at 1972 market prices) grew at average rates of 6.0Z p.a. and 5.71 p.a.
respectively. The GDP elasticity with respect to electricity consumption was
constant at about 1.5 in both these periods. GDP is expected to increase at
an annual average rate of 5.0% during the period 1985-90 and electricity
consumption at 5.5% p.a., implying an elasticity of 1.1. The decline in
elasticity is primarily a consequence of real increases in electricity prices
planned for the period.
5.03     Gross consumption of electricity on the public supply system is
projected to increase slightly faster than national consumption at about 5.8%
p.a. during the period 1985-90 because of autoproducers generating a smaller
share of national output. The electricity demand forecasts, which were
reviewed and revised by the Bank mission during the appraisal of the project,
are shown in Annex 10 and 11 and summarized in the following table:

Least-Cost Power Generation Program
5.04     The primary economic justification for the project is that it is part
of the least cost investment program for the national electric power system.
This investment program was established using the WASP III computer program of
the IAEA by EPBIH who contracted BKI to carry out the analysis. WASP III uses
a dynamic programming approach to optimize a least cost investment program.
The optimization studies were carried out for the period 1989-2000. Plant to
be commissioned before 1989 was assumed to be committed or under construction.
5.05     The optimization studies considered 35 hydro projects (Annex 12) and
a.ignite, brown coal, oil, gas turbine and PWR and CANDU nuclear alternatives
(Annex 13). An investment program was obtained using WASP III which minimized
the present value of the costs of investment, fuel, other operating costs and
unserved energy. This investment program is shown in Annex 14. The analysis
shows that the Visegrad project is the highest priority of the alternatives
considered as it was selected for commissioning in 1989 before any other
alternative. Visegrad is to be followed by 900 MW of lignite plant i- 1990,
and 500 MW of brown coal olant plus the Strbicki Buk (35 MW), Jajce (48 MW),
Drina (2x69 MW), Buk Bijela (505 MW), V. Togare (248 MW) and M. Dubravica (105
MW) hydroelectric plants in 1991. Projected generatiLn of electricity
(Annex 15) shows the share of hydro increasing from its present level of about



- 34 -
35% to 38Z in 1990 as new hydro station are completed. Thereafter, the
lignite and brown coal station planned for the 1990's would lower the share of
hydro generation to 31X by the end of the century.
Rate of Return Analysis
5.06     The Visegrad hydroelectric project is part of the country-wide
1983-1989 investment program in generation, transmission and distribution
which will be required to meet the incremental demand on the Yugoslav
integrated power system in 1989. The rate of return was therefore calculated
for one-year increment in demand in 1989 when Visegrad will be fully in
service. Other generation projects needed to meet the increment in demand are
Koziak, Vroho, Zajov and Perucica and Kosovo "A" rehabilitation projects.
Since the Yugoslav authorities have expressed their commitment to raising
electricity tariffs to the level of LRMC by December 31, 1987 (para. 1.08),
measuring the incremental benefits at LRMC as revenues to the Yugoslav
integrated power system arising from the timeslice therefore yields a rate of
return which is approximately equal to the opportunity cost of capital, i.e.,
the discount rate of the least-cost investment program of 10%. Using revenues
as a proxy for the benefits of electricity supply gives an indication of the
adequacy of tariff levels set at the LRMC as much as the economic
justification of the project, which is based primarily on the basis of its
being part of the least-cost investment program.  The capital costs of the
Visegrad project, other generation projects and the transmission and
distribution required to service the increment in demand were evaluated net of
taxes and duties. The economic analysis is shown in Annex 16.
5.07     Additional benefits arising from recreation and fishing on the lake
formed by the Visegrad project have not been taken into account, since these
are difficult to measure and are also probably insignificant in relation to
the incremental revenues.
S^ensitivity Analysis
5.08     The rate of return on the time slice of the 'nvestment program is
relatively insensitive to changes in the capital cost of the Visegrad project
but relatively sensitive to changes in the program benefits. If the benefits
are cut by 20C, the rate of return would fall to 6.2%, whereas a 25% increase
in the capital cost of Visegrad results in a rate of return of 9.3X. This,
therefore, underscores the importance of tariff adjuv-.ments in compliance with
the Third Power Transmission Loan Agreement.

Proiect Risks
5.09     Load Growth: The future load growth accepted in this report is lower
than the past growth (para. 4.02) and takes into consideration projected
economic development and planned increases in electricity prices. There is
some chance that the actual growth could be lower than the estimates due to
economic growth being slower than anticipated, or demand being more sensitive
to increases in electricity tariffs than expected. In that cases some
projects following the Visegrad Hydroelectric project would be rescheduled.
The Yugoslav power system is interconnected with the western European and CMEA
power systems and trade varies from year to year depending on the domestic
energy balance between available supply and domestic demand. Increased power
exchange would offset the economic consequences of demand being lower (or
higher) thAn expected.
5.10     Tariffs: A further point of consideration is that the tariff
increases to comply with the Third Power Transmission Project and SAL I Loan
covenants (paras 1.08 and 4.06) might not be achieved. However, tariffs have
been increased substantially in the past (about 140% between November 1983 to
January 1985). Non-compliance with the covenant could lead to a rate of
return which would be lower than the opportunity cost of capital.  This,
therefore, underscores the importance of continuing the on-going tariff
adjustments to bring them to the levels of economic cost. Since real
increases have been effected in the past during periods of relatively higher
levels of inflation than the future proiected levels, there appears to be no
indication of noncompliance with the above covenant and therefore no undue
risk with regard to the project.
5.11    Construction and Proiect Costs: Although site investigations and
subsurface exploration have shown that geological conditions of some areas of
the dam's foundation excavation, particularly non-overflow sections (i.e.,
mostly right bank and lesser left bank side) are not favorable, no potential
risks are anticipated in implementing the proposed project beyond those which
are norally expected in the construction of a project of this type and size.
Foreseeable construction risks have been taken into consideration in the
design of the project and in the cost estimates as explained in Chapter III
and Annex 3.
5.12    Other Risks: Other risks are considered to be minor and should be
solved without any major cost increases or construction delays.

for Loan 2338-YU is to be included in the project's loan
agreement (para. 4.11);
(h)  evidence of an agreement between EPBIH and SDK regarding
suitable solutions to SDK's major qualifications in the 1982
audit report by Deceuber 31, 1985 (para. 4.05); and
Ci) before making any modifications to the construction program of
the borrower resulting in a cost variation in excess of t20
million dinars equivalent, EPBIH would exchange views with the
Bank on the proposed mDdification (para. 4.14).

YUGOSLAVIA
VISEGRAD HYDROELECT-RIC PROJECT
Existing Power Facilities
Overview
1.       Yugoslavia has a relatively large interconnected power network, so
called "Nikola Tesla", with 3,'21 km of 400-KV power lines  interconnecting
power systems of six republics and two autonomous provinces in the country.
At the end of 1983, the total installed capacity of generation stations in the
interconnected system was 17,743 MW consisting of 41% hydrocapacity (7,330 MW)
and 59% thermal capacity (10,413 MW). The thermal capacity consists of coal
plants (77%), oil and gas plants (17%), and nuclear plant (6%). In 1983 the
total gross electricity production amounted to 67,054 GWh of which of 21,836
GWh 33% were produced from hydrostations and 45,218 GWh or 67% from thermal
stations. About 38% of thermal production was from coal plants, 9% from
nuclear station, and only 8% from oil and gas fired plants. The total
electricity consumption and losses in 1983 amounted to 68,109 GWh of which
70.5% was consumed in lower voltage (lower than llO-kV) distribution systems
24.5% bulk industrial consumers, 1.3% water pumping into storage reservoirs
and 3.7% consumed in the high-voltage (higher than llO-kV) power grid as
system losses. The Republics and the Autonomous Provinces (RIPs) had
exchanged power among their power systems and with the neighboring countries.
Statistical data on the Yugoslav interconnected power system is given in Annex
2 and the geographic location in the attached Map IBRD L8477.
2.       Power system of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina generates about 19.2% of
the total amount of the Yugoslav electric power generation. The Republic's
power system is being operated by EPBIH and consists of generation,
transmission and distribution facilities interconnected and operated at
400,220, 110, 35, 20, and 0.4-kV voltage levels. Transmission voltages are
110-kV and above, distribution are 35-kV and lower voltages. Total plant
installed capacity in 1983 was 3,005 MW, of which 52% hydro and the remaining
thermal. In 1983, total length of transmission lines was 4882 km,
distribution lines 80,774 km, and installed capacity of transformer stations
was 8,767 MVA. In 1983 maximum demand was 1,788 MW, Total sales Amounted to
11,710 GWh including inter-republican sales of 2,823 GWh, total supply was
12,776 GWh including inter-republican purchases of 2,239 GWh. Statistical
data on EPBIH's interconnected system is given in Annex 2.
3.       Power system of R/Ps are controlled by various dispatching centers at
the republic and the provincial level located at the republics and the
provinces. The 400-kV power grid is controlled by JUGEL's dispatching center
at the national level located at Belgrade. Each R/P is primarily responsible
for meeting the demand in its system and also from scheduled power exchanges
with other R/P systems. The power exchange with the neighboring countries are
solely within the responsibilities of JUGEL's dispatching center which also
takes over all control of Yugoslav system during system disturbances to
isolate faulty area and restore the 400-kV system operations. Possible

generation surpluses of R/Ps after their own demand and scheduled power
exchanges could be utilized to meet the demand of a temporary deficit in any
area, including the areas in the neighboring countries' systems operating in
parallel with the Yugoslav power system, through JUGEL's dispatching center.
Plant Capacity

organization, although the plant itself is located in one of the partner's
power system which is operated by one of the partner on the basis of
self-management agreements. Most of the bulk power exchange activities are
related to jointly owned power plants. The nuclear power plant is located in
Slovenia (Krsko Nuclear Station), jointly owned by ZEOH and EGS. In 1983 the
total number of plants owned by power organizations was 114 with a total
capacity of 16,950 MW.

8.       Yugoslavia also exchanged power with the neighboring countries in
1983. Total imports amounted to 2,681.0 GWh. Total power exchange was about
4,307 GWh, imported from Bulgaria (27.5 GWh), Czechoslovakia (552.9 GWh), West
Germany (161.9 GWH), Greece (24.6 GWh), Italy 6 (1,198.2 GWh), Hungary (60.8
GWh), Austria (146.8 GWh), Romania (8.8 GWh), USSR (97.1 GWh), Switzerland
(552.9 GWh), and Albania (364.9 GWh). Total exports amounted to 1,626.2 GWh,
exported to Bulgaria (15.2 GWh), Greece (616.4 GWh), Italy (548.4 GWh),
Hungary (37.8 GWh), Austria (151.1 GWh), Roinania (7.5 GWh) and Switzerland

Communication and Energy Management System
11.      EPBIH and other power organizations have a communication systems
throughout the country suitable for the method being used for the load
dispatching, switching, and data acquisition. However, the Yugoslav power
system and also power systems of many power organizations are large and cannot
be operated in the most efficient way under reasonable degree of safety
without a modern energy management system (EMS). Existing load dispatching
centers are very old and using old techniques and cannot:
- provide comprehensive data for planning,
- provide automatic load dispatching to hundreds of generation
units to minimize the generation cost in the interconnected
Yugoslav power system,
- rapidly isolate faulty areas in the system during system
disturbances and restore system operations, and
-  control active and reactive power flow safely as not to exceed
line and tras-former capacity and/or keep the voltage levels at
the various busbars within the acceptable limits in the most
cost-effective way.
12.      To improve the energy management system of Yugoslavia, the Bank has
provided US$120 million under loan 2338-YU, Third Power Transmission Project
which would cost Yugoslavia about US$321 million equivalent. The above
difficulties in the power systems control will be solved satisfactorily when
the Third Power Transmission Project is fully completed in 1988.

VISEGRAD HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
Project Description
General
1.       The Visegrad Hydroelectric Project is located on the Drina River,
which is one of the major tributaries of the Sava River whose waters flow into
the Black Sea through the Danube. The Drina River basin is large; it almost
covers the entire central part of Yugoslavia (19,580 km2 - about 8% of the
total country), and it is an interrepublican basin shared with SR Montenegro,
Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia. The Drina River drains the central part
of the Dinaric Alps from the Albanian border to the Panonia Plain. It is
formed by the rivers Tara and Piva. which meet in Scepan Polje and continue
flowing under the name Drina. The entire basin has been thoroughly reviewed
for more than ten years for the development of the various projects, including
the Visegrad hydroelectric project. Investigation of the Drina River as a
energy source goes back for more than a century.
Hydrology
2.       The Drina basin surface up to Visegrad is about 13,934 km7.  The
main tributaries of the Drina River up to Visegrad are the Tara, Piva,
Cehotina, Lim, and Praca Rivers.; The total length of the river course
amounts to about 4,400 km, the diversity of the river network is about
4,400/13,934 = 0.34 km per km2. The average altitude of the basin is about
2,270 m from sea level. Average annual precipitation is about 1,230 mm and
more than 100 mm monthly up to the Visegrad site.
3.       Systematic records for water measurements in the Drina River goes
back to 1890 at the Mehwet Pasha Sokolovic's old stone bridge, which was
constructed in the 1570s. Average flow established based on the most reliable
recording period from 1926 to 1965 measures 342 m3/sec. The minimum
observed flow is about 32,6 m3/sec. (with a probability of about 1.5%), and
the maximum observed flow 4,370 m3/sec (with a probability of about 3.5%).
The 10,000-year catastrophic flow rate is 9,783 m3/sec. (last occurrance is
believed in 1896).
Geology and Seismology
4.       The Visegrad site is basically composed of paleozoic state and
sandstone, lower triassic sandstone and state, middle triassic and upper
triassic limestone and dolomite, middle triassic and jurassic flint, tufas and
igneous rocks. From the engineering and geological points of view, the dam
site terrain is formed of bounds rocks of good geological characteristics and
high values of physical and mecianical parameters. A total of 88 boreholes
were drilled to the depth of 80 to 300 meters with a total length of about
6,000 linear meters with core samples.

5.       Geological mapping, test pits and exploration galleries (adits),
testing of permeability in drill holes and measurement of ground water levels,
seismic refraction geophysical survey, measurement of rock modules of
deformation in audits, and correlation with local seismic velocity sear tests
of rock and of rock-concrete contacts, tests of grouting methods and
materials, a local network for earthquake and micro-earthquake detention and
also laboratory testing of rock and soil have been thoroughly performed and
the preliminary design has been modified on the basis of outcome of the above
tests.  There is no indication regarding any important geological problems,
and the Bank consultants have concurred with the borrower's consultants that
it is extremely improbable that measurable leakage will occur from the
reservoir area and that this possibility is limited to the vicinity of the dam
site.
Ecology
6.       A comprehensive environmental report was orepared by the consultants
of the borrower in 1975 and revised from time to time (latest in 1983).  The
report covers many environmental aspects, including the possible impact of the
project on development of the raparian area, climatic characteristics of the
regions, influence of the storage on the possibility of earthquakes, health
and population, living conditions, tourism and fish industry, traffic
conditions, hydrography, economical environment, navigability and water
sports, socio-economic conditions, flood, siltation, wave action, land slides,
agricultural aspects and vegetation, resettlement, cultural movements, natural
beauty and rarities.
7.       The environmental effects of the project would be insignificant for
the following reasons:
(i) The reservoir will be small in area (36 x 170 m wide) normally
6.5 kmn2, and reaching to 8.9 km2 at maximum flood level;
(ii) The new tracts to be flooded outside the canyon are small in
area (9 kmn2) of mainly barren flood-prone land;
(iii) The Drina River has long been dammed downstream (by the Bajina
Basta hydroproject in Bosnia (closed in 1964) and Zvornik in
Serbia (closed in 1958). Upstream some major tributaries also
have been dammed (e.g., Petpec, Bistrica), and the main stem is
planned to be dammed at Foca (Buk Bijela) after Visegrad is
completed;
(iv) There is little habitation (225 families), cultivation (134 ha),
or other buildings (475) to be relocated; and
(v) Since the project is temperate (partly Alpine), no water-related
diseases or siltation problems are envisaged. The already cold
water is likely to become even colder with the project. The
project has no major direct effect on tourism, and there are no
important artifacts or mineral desposits to be inundated.

8.       There are two environmental subjects worthy of mention.  These are
"water pollution" and 'industrial effluents."
9.-      Pollution:  At present there is no sewage treatment for any of the
riverside towns, namely Gorazde (population - 15,000) and Visegrad (population
- 10,000). However, the free flowing nature of the Drina is adequate at
present to maintain water quality in the river. When the dam is closed, these
pollutant sources could seriously degrade the quality of impounded waters.
Present plans call for completion and operation of sewage collection and
treatment by local town authorities before the closure of the Visegrad dam.
This will be followed up by BED.
10.      Industrial Effluents:  The major industry ("Unis Azot" = "United
Nitrogen") on the southern outskirts of Gorazde manufactures nitric acid (95Z)
and ammonium nitrate (5Z) from BBC/Winkler gasification of brown coal.  Two of
the three main effluents (25°C cooling water, and accidental acid spills
neutralized to pH 7 with limestone) are not expected to cause problems. The
third discharges 400 cubic meter/hours (x 24 hours) of scrubber and cyclone
effluent into the river. A small black stream in the river goes down to
Visegrad much of the time and occasionally even beyond.
IL.      The sediment is primarily ash (about 60 percent) with the remainder
(about 40 percent) organic matter. This organic matter is present in
sufficient quantity to give the overall sediment a greasy tar-like texture.
Ash analysis of the major constituents indicates the material is not toxic in
an acute sense. However, neither trace metal nor heavy organic analysis was
performed to indicate the chronic toxicity of this sediment. EPBIH's
consultants recommended a program of water quality monitoring and analysis
upstream, downstream and at the point of wastewater discharge. Furthermore,
studies are underway (to be completed at the end of 1985) to determine the
impacts of these effluents on water quality and impoundment ecology. The
sediment forms hard (3 -) deposits on rocks in the river downstream and the
risks includng deposition of this sediment on the cooling coils and elsewhere
will be assessed by ENERGOINVEST and the design will be modified if necessary
to prevent these deposits. The impact of any design modification should be
negligible and covered by contingencies. "Unis Azot" company is aware of the
problem and the sediment from the ash slurry discharge is to be reduced when a
control plant (now under construction) comes into operation. The stu'.ies of
effluent impacts currently in progress should examine the design of the
control plant and assess its adequacy in preventing pollution in the river
impoundment. MEM will monitor this activity closely aad provide the Bank all
study results as they become available. Gorazde's major cement industry next
to 'Tnis Azot" was abandoned in 1977 partly because of excessive air pollution.
Master Water Management Study
12.      Utilization of the Drina River hydro potential has been under
investigation at project level since 1960. the Drina River is one of the most
important rivers in Yugoslavia having the greatest quantity of water. The
average quantity of 21.7 l/sec/'&m2 compared to Yugoslav average of 13.7
lsec/km'. The highest flows o3f the Drina River are in late autumn and

ANNEX 3
Page 4 of 9
spring and the lowest are by the end of sin er and winter. Yugoslavia has
22,640 m3 of useful reservoir storage of which 27T is on the Drina.
13.      Hydroelectric potential of the Drina and its tributaries amounts to
about 14,123 GWh p.a. and 3,904 MW in 29 cascade hydroelectric projects of
which 2,882 GWh and 611 MW in 6 sites have been developed. Major
hydroelectric projects (more than 100 MW capacity) upstream of Visegrad are
Bijeli Brijeg (275-MW), Bistrica (105-MW), Mratinje (342-MW), Buk Bijela
(450-MW), Ustikolina (103-MW). Major hydroelectric projects downstream
Visegrad are Bajina Basta (360-MW), V. Tegare (248-MW), V. Dubrav (505-MW),
and M. Dubrav (105-MW). So far, only Bistrica and Bajina Basta were
constructed. Smaller hydroelectric projects in operation upstream Visegrad
are: Sjenica (32 MW), Kokin Brod (20-MW), Potpec (54-MW). Downstream of
Visegrad are Zvornik (96 MW). Optimization of the cascade plants system
operations have been completed by taken navigation, flood control, and
irrigation aspects into consideration.
Flood Control and Irrigation Aspects
14.      Comprehensive studies regarding problems of floods and flood control
have been carried out by the consultants of the borrower. Studies have shown
that accumulation capacity of the entire Drina development is small compared
to the flood waves. There will be about 1.8S less energy productiora to leave
spare volume in the reservoirs to reduce a 500-year probability of flood to
acceptable flow limits. To cope with higher flood waves more than 500-year
probability will not be worthwhile because it would cause substantial losses
in energy production. Visegrad hydroelectric Project's flood control
possibility is insignificant and has practically no significant irrigation
aspect.
General Layout of the Project
15.      The site in the mnost downstream part of the Upper Drina River was
selected after careful consideration of the geographical position for
environmental aspects, optimum size of the reservoir, existing and future
power plants on the Drina and their confluents, the position of the existing
and the future public traffic routes and geological, hydrological geotechnical
and topographical aspects and operations anl maintenance of power and other
public facilities. Possible dam types and relevant layout solutions of the
entire project were thoroughly analyzed. Alternatives were an earth dam, a
hollow concrete dam, a gravity concrete dam, and an arch dam. After
thoroughly analysis of all alternatives, the concrete gravity dam with
incorporated powerhouse was selected as the optimnum solution as explained
below:
- Gravity non-overflow dam blocks along both the left and right
bank of the river;
- Discharge part of the dam in the central section of the river
bed closer to the right bank; and



- 51 -
ANNEX 3
Page 5 of 9
- a conventional powerhouse made of reinforced concrete between
the discharge section of the dam and the left gravity block,
i.e., closer to the left bank of the river.
All the other peripheral facilities (e.g., access roads, control buildings,
storehouse) will be located at the most suitable places on the site. Summary
of basic characteristics of various facilities is given at the end of this
Annex.

17.      For the construction of the dam and embankments, it is necessary to
excavate about 806,000 m 3 of soil, to cast 331,000 mi3 of concrete, and to
provide 6,002 tons of steel framework.

ANNEX 3
Page 6 of 9
For construction of the powerhouse, it is necessary to excavate about
173,000 m3 of soil, to cast 222,000 m3 of concrete, and to provide 9,000
tons of steel framework.
Peripheral Facilities
19.      Due to terrain configuration, the three-story administration
building, with an operation and control room, had to be cut into rock by the
assembly platform of the powerhouse. The building includes diesel generator
emergency set workshops, store rooms, 20/0.4-kV transformer station, cable
room, tool room, sanitary facilities, a restaurant and a garage. Battery and
d.c. supply system, commumication equipment, and also rooms for the
administrative personnel will be located in the building.
Access Roads, Grouting Works, etc.
20.      Some existing roads of about 40 km, which will be inundated after
formation of the reservoir will be relocated to higher elevations. A new
bridge will also be built on the left side, about 700 m upstream of the old
"Bridge on the Drina", and the dam on the Visegrad-Gock main highway. On the
opposite side, the plant will be connected with the public road Visegrad-Dusce
by a new bridge near to the dam's discharge structures.
21.      Geological and hydrological investigations have shown that the main
grouting curtain at dam site, consolidation and contact grouting at the joint
of the dam and the rock foundation and also around discharge structures are
necessary. During the appraisal the grouting plan have, among other things,
was thoroughly reviewed by the Bank's consultants and the amount of grouting
has increased about from 100X to 2002 in various places and cost impact of
this was assessed.
22.      Detailed geological mapping has been completed during the last five
years. Careful review of the reservoir area has indicated that there are some
unstable slopes to be stabilized. During the appraisal, Bank consultants
thoroughly reviewed the area, and appropriate funds were allocated for the
stabilization.
eydromechanical Equipment
23.      Hydromechanical equipment consists of discharge structures (submerged
outlets and overflow sections), intake structures, and a diffusion section.
Discharge structures include four oil hydraulic servomotor-operated segment
gates (6.0 x 8.0 m each) with a discharge capacity of 4,970 m3/sec. For
protection and maintenance of the sediment gates four board-like slide gates
are provided (6.0 x 11.0 m each). The slide gate will also be operated by oil
hydraulic servomotor control system with an operation speed of approximately
0.5 m/min. for lifting and lowering. In addition to these gates, board-like
sliding accessory gates are also provided (6.0 m x 13.3 m) upstream of the
above slide gates to be used during the repair of safety gates. Moreover,
additional board-like sliding accessory sloping gates at the downstream of the



- 53 -
ANNEX 3
Page 7 of 9
segment gates (7.2 m x 5.7 m) are provided to be used against tail waters
during the repair of the segment gates. These gates are operated by a portal
crane which at the same time served diffusion gates by semiautomatic pliers.
24.      Discharge structures overflow section consists of two openings
(18 x 18.9 m each). The total discharge capacity of this section is about
6,220 m3/sec. Both overflow openings have segment gates (18 x 19.6 m) which
are hydraulic servomotor operated (0.4 to 0.5 mJmin. lifting/lowering speed).
Accessory gates (18 x 18.9 m) to be used during the repair and inspection of
the overflow segment gates are also provided. These gates will be operated by
a crane at the dam crest to lift and lower the gates by hydraulic automatic
pliers.
Intake Structures Equipment
25.      The intake structure equipment consists of (from upstream to
downstream) a intake lattice rake (to catch floating debris and the like in
the river) with dimensions of 2 x (8.0 x 22 m), accessory gates
(6.75 x 12.16 m), main gates (6.75 x 12.32 m), and diffusion gates (7.25 x
7.40 m). The Turbine is located between the main gates and the diffusion
gates. All gates are board-like sliding gates. A cleaning machine will be
provided (a simple crane) to pool the coliected debris in the front of the
rake up to the dam crest. The accessory gates will be placed and taken off by
the crane at the dam crest. The main gates will be lifted by a hydraulic
servomotor system and lowered by its own weight with the help of the crane at
the dam crest. The diffusions gates will be operated by a crane at the dam
crest.
Electromechanical Equipment
26.      Electromechanical equipment will be located in the powerhouse, and
its immediate vicinity mainly consists of turbines, generator, powerhouwse
auxiliaries, control and communication systems and the switchgear.
27.      Design of the project will provide turbines, with a gross water head
of 47.2 m, net water head is 27.0 m, and the design water head is 43.0 m.
Minimum water flow could be as low as 50 m3/sec. for several months during
the dry periods. Design water flow for the three turbines is 3 x
267 m3/sec. (total flow 800 m3/sec.). Rotor axis will be about 6.8 m
under the minimum tail water level and that it is in accordance with the
chosen cavitation coefficient of 0.3936. Turbine revolution will be 395 rpm
while generator revolution will be 136 rpm. On the basis of the given
parameters and the conditions of the work, Kaplan type turbines with a
diameter of 6.15 m is selected as the optimum solution. Each turbine will
produce 105-MW at the design head of 43.0 m.
28.      Generators' nominal power will be 115 MVA at 0.95 power factor and
50 Hz standard frequency of the system. Nominal voltage is 15.75 kV + 152,
nominal current is 4,220 Ampere. For generator excitation, a self-exciting

system is used with multiple-operated convertors and multiple parameter
automation regulators. The generators are cooled by circulating air with
water coolers supplied by a common pipeline coming from the turbine intakes
through shut-off valves.  Carbon-dioxide gas will be used through an automatic
system in case of a fire in the generators.
29.      Three single-phase (16/400 kV) transformer banks plus one spare for
each generator will be placed on the platform at the downstream wall of the
powerhouse. Low voltage bus-bars is connected to generator terminals by a
metal-clad conductor system, and the high-voltage sides are connected to the
400-kV power line cell by means of metal-clad conductors with SF6 gas
insulation. In case of a fault on one of the single-phase transformers, it is
possible to switch on the spare in a short time. Nominal capacity of each
bank is 115 MVA with forced circulating oil (oil will be cooled by cooling
water system).
Cranes
30.      Two bridge cranes will be located in the powerhouse with a capacity
of about 200 tons each with accessory hooks with capacity of 25 and 5 tons.
The span of crane is 22.1 m and the height to which the main hook is lifted is
41.4 m.
Construction Method
31.      Construction details are based on hydrological, climatic, geological,
geotechnical, traffic, and other conditions at the dam site and in the broader
surroundings of the place of construction.
32.      The foundation of the abandoned railway located on the right side of
the Drina River will be used as the main construction traffic route where the
main construction plant will be located (concrete production facilities,
cement silos, water tanks, explosive storage, etc.).  The aggregate for the
concrete, which will be obtained from the querry located about 5 km upstream
from the dam will also be transported on this route. During construction, the
left and the right sides will be connected with a construction bridge at the
downstream of the dam and concrete will be placed by a cable crane which would
bridge the river at the dam site.
33.      Construction is planned to be compLeted within about 5 years' time
(55 months). Drina has a substantial amount of water, a 5-year flood rate of
about 3,000 m /sec. is a very high rate, and diversion of entire flood is
not practical. Therefore, construction will be carried out into two phases,
i.e., water flow in the riverbed would be directed through a half of the
riverbed until the completion of the construction works in the other half of
the river. A 15 m high concrete wall will be constructed at the middle of the
river to carry out construction works in the dry. After completion of the
construction works of the first phase in the right half of the riverbed, water
flow will be directed by means of embankment through temporary openings and

the discharge section t-hat constructed in the first phase. The powerhouse,
closer to the left bank and other structures, will be constructed during the
second phase. A construction schedule is given as Chart 4.

Notes and Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
1.       The forecasts have been prepared using current prices with 1983 as a
base year. To allow for future price rises, the following indices have been
used:
1984     1985     1986      1987     1988    1989    1990
Local costs (M)        65       45        30       25        25      25        25
Foreign costs ({)       3.5      8.0       9.0      9.0       9.0     7.5       6.0
All additions and withdrawals have been assumed to take place at mid-year.
Revaluations has been performed at end-year. Exchange rates have been
computed every six months assuming purchasing-power equivalence. The 1981 and
1982 financial statements are as audited, with provisions made for
qualifications. The 1983 statements are provisional (as of August 1984).
2. Income Statements
(a)  Electricity Sales.  Sales of energy have been estimated by
Elektroprivreda from expected generating capacity installed. For the
purpose of the forecasts, a 35X tariff increase has been assumed on
January 1985, to compensate for the balance of the 1984 inflation.
Afterwards, tariffs have been increased every six months to make up
for the inflation during that period. The surcharge, indexed both on
inflation and on electricity purchases, has been abolished as of
December 31, 1985.
(b) Other revenues which mainly comprise interest received, Bank deposits
and other investments and sales of unprocessed material and scrap
have been increased by using the price escalation rates.
(c)  Purchases of electricity have been indexed on quantities provided by
the EPBIH energy balance and also on inflation, using the same
pattern as for electricity sales. They will disappear after 1988
because of the completion of the Visegrad project.
(d) Fuel comprises lignite and a modest amount of oil. It has been
indexed on quantities (provided by EPBIH) and also on inflation,
using the actual price in August 1984 as a basis.
(e) Salaries and wages are based on personnel forecasts at mid-year and
salary rates at mid-1984 and increased by using the price escalation
rates.

ANNEX 6

(f)  Other operating costs include maintenance and insurance adjusted for
inflation and are based on average cost per kWh sold (basis 1984).
(g) Statutory and contractual obligations include obligations to the
municipality, to the province and to the Federation azd have been
indexed on dohodak, i.e., net income before deduction ox salaries and
wages, interest an debt and certain other liabilities which are
treated as appropriations of income.
(h)  Depreciation has been calculated on average revalued gross fixed
assets in service and assumes that minimum rates prescribed by
federal law will be maintained. Gross fixed assets have been divided
into three groups for depreciation purpose: hydro plants (3.2X),
thermal plants (4.0%) and transmission and distribution (4.5X).
Completed project have been put in service at the expected
commissioning date.
(i) Interest excludes interest during construction which is capitalized.
(j) Appropriation of net income. According to EPBIH self-management
agreement, it has been distributed in the following order:
(i)  Reserve fund : 4% of dohodak (operating income and
salaries minus interest expense).
(ii)  Business fund:  20% of the investment expenditures of
the year.
(iii) Collective consumption fund and other funds: the balance of
net income.
3. Balance Sheets
(a) Fixed assets have been taken on charge on the estimated completion
date for construction of each project. Construction costs have been
escalated by converting the foreign component into dinars at constant
mid-1984 prices over the 1984-90 period and then using the local
inflation rate for each year. Fixed assets, including fixed assets
in progress, and the rel'ted provisions for depreciation have been
revalued each year using the local escalation rate and the net
adjustment applied to the business fund (equity). In particular, an
adjustment has been made in the 1983 balance sheet to allow for the
past revaluation of fixed assets in progress. Fixed assets in
progress have been transferred project by project at their current
value.
(b) Long-term debt (foreign portion) has been revalued at the end of each
year using the exchange rate at that date. The corresponding
adjustment has been included in fixed assets in service, where it has
been accumulated, but not revalued again as part of fixed assets.

(c) Accounts receivable have been assumed to be equal to 41 days' sales
at the end of each year.
4. Sources and Applications of Funds
(a) Borrowing. The following terms have been assumed for borrowing:
-   Reimbursable consumers contributions:  cease after 1988 and are
reimbursable starting in 1991 over 15 years at 6% interest.
-   Fund for underdeveloped regions:  repaid over 15 years, starting
6 months after commissioning of the given facility - interest
7.5%.
-   Commercial banks:  repaid over 10 years, starting 6 months after
commissioning of the given facility. From 1984, and in
conformity with an agreement concluded between Yugoslavia and
the International Monetary Fund, the interest rates are variable
and, taking into account the adopted escalation rates, have been
assumed to be:
1984          1985          1986           1987-90
24            32            32               27
-    Foreign loans and credits:  other than the IDED loan assumed to
be repaid over 10 years, starting 6 months af._er commissioning
of the given facility. Average interest 10% in for-ign
currency, then converted into dinars at the current exchange
rate.
(b) The revaluation of the foreign loans has been included in both the
sources and applications of funds.
(c) The contribution-to-investment ratio has been calculated as: (net
cash generation pius non-reimbursable consumers contributions minus
changes in net current and non-current assets) divided by (total
construction program plus revaluation of foreign loans).

Outline of Terms of Reference for Financial Managemeat Study
The terms of reference was reviewed during the negotiations and
agreed with EPBIH and BED.
Given below is a broad list of tasks for the proposed study, each of
which has two phases. During the first phase, for both EPBEI and HED, the
current systems and procedures would be reviewed, problem areas identified,
and modified or new systems and procedures would be developed. During the
second phase, the modified or new systems would be implemented and training
programs would be developed and initiated. For trainiag purposes, the
consultants should identify specific objectives of training, field of training
for each level and category of staff, with estinated nunbers of trainees;
develop training guidelines, schedules, and course materials for the entire
program of training; estimate costs of training; and prepare a time schedule
for implementation.
Task I
Review existing organization, identify issues and make
recommendations for appropriate structures in which the constituent
organizations are suitably integrated in the composite organization in such a
way that the composite organization is enabled to fulfill its designated role
of centralized planning including financial planning while at the same time
the constituent organizations retain their decentralized functions and freedom
of operations in accordance with the Self-Management Agreement. Initiate a
suitable program of staff training.
Task II
Review present accounting systems including practices related to
coding and closing of accounts and preparation of consolidated accounts and
identify issues. Introduce and expand strict and uniform internal audit
procedures within workers and composite organizations. Develop modified
accounting systems geared to the timely preparation of consolidated accounts
of the composite organization which would form the basis for a sound
mmnagement information system. The consolidated accounts will comprise the
accounts of all entities in the group and will eliminate all interorganization
transactions. Assist in the preparation of procedure manuals and forms and in
the implementation of mDdified accounting systems and procedure. Initiate
program of training supervisory level personnel and all mebers of accounting
staff in the details of the new systems.

Task III
Review financial reporting and budgetary control procedures and
develop and implement new or modified financial reporting and budgeting
control systems and procedures in respect of both investment (construction)
accounting, budgeting and reporting and operations accounting, budgeting and
reporting. Develop a statistical database and appropriate financial
indicators of performance, both for past and future operations. The
management information systems should be such as to facilitate proper
financial planning of investment and operations, timely review of performance
against budgetary allocations and timely initiation of corrective measures to
secure the full implementation of the plan of investment and operations.
Introduce a modest amount of computer software. Train staff during the
implementation of the new system and get under way a continuing plan for
training of staff.

VISEGRAD HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
Rate of Return Analysis
Introduction
1.       The rate of return analysis of the country-wide time slice power
investment program is set out on page 3 of this Annex. The program is
estimated to have a rate of return of 10%, which is equal to the opportunity
cost of capital and indicates the adequacy of tariffs set at the long-run
marginal cost of supply. Key assumptions are set out below.
Benefits
2.       Because of the difficulty in measuring the benefits of electricity
supply in existing markets, incremental revenues were taken as proxy for the
Project benefits. Visegrad is scheduled for commissioning in 1989. The
incremental total system generation in 1989 is projected to be 4,925 GWh,
equivalent to 4,259 GWh sold to final consumers.
3.            Under the Third Power Transmission Project (Loan 2338-YU) and
SAL I (Loan 2326-YU), the authorities have agreed to raise tariffs to the
level of LRMC by 1987. Yugoslav institutions are presently carrying out
studies to determine the level of LRMC. Preliminary estimates of LRMC are
available from the report "Yugoslavia, Constraints & Prospects for
Restructuring the Energy Sector" (Report 4797-YU). By January 1, 1988 the
sectoral consumption weighted LRMC would be US 4.04 cents/kWh.
Capital Costs
4.            Capital costs of the Visegrad Projact were taken from the
project cost tables (Annex 4), less taxes and duties, but including physical
coutingencies. Other generation projects commissioned in 1989 to meet the
incremental demand are the Koziak, Zavoj and Vrkovo hydroelectr c stations and
their capital costs are included also. Transmission and distribution costs
were estimated using long run average incremental costs from the energy sector
study (Report 4797-YU) adjusted to 1984 prices, since no national investment
programs for transmission and distribution were available to the mission.
Operating and Maintenance Costs
5.            Operating costs for the Visegrad Project were taken from the
consultant's feasibility report, which estimated the costs of principal
items. The operating costs of the other hydro projects were taken to be tile
same percentage of their capital cost as that of Visegrad. Transmission and
distribution operating and maintenance costs were estimated as 1% of the
capital costs.

Fuel Costs
6.       The output of Visegrad and the other incremental hydro projects in a
mean hydrological year is about 2,390 GWh, which is less than the incremental
generation of 4,925 GWh. The cost of meeting this incremental generation
would therefore include the cost of generation from other sources. The cost
of fuel was estimated from the WASP output data as difference in the total
cost of fuel between 1988 and 1989. This is equivalent to US$ 1.77 cents/KWh
at February 1985 prices. The WASP analysis used the following fuel prices:
US$/million kilo calories
Lignite    =  4.73 -  7.96
Brown coal = 16.25 - 19.36
Fuel oil   = 25.46
