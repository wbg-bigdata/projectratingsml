PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Third Highway
Project in Zambia, for which Loan 1566-ZA in the amount of US$11.25 million
and Credit 798-ZA in the amount of US$11.25 million were approved on May
11, 1978. The loan and credit were closed on June 30, 1986, three years
behind schedule. The credit was fully disbursed. A total of US$2.9 million
of the loan was cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division,
Southern Africa Department, of the Africa Regional Office and is based,
inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, Reappraisal Report, Loan/Credit
Agreements, supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the
Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft was sent to the Borrower on September 24, 1990, for comments by
November 12, 1990, but none were received.

THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1566-ZAlCREDIT 798-ZA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiective
1.        The principal objectives of the Third Highway Project were to
improve the maintenance of the rapidly deteriorating road network and to
plan for future extension of the network. Specifically, the project aimed
at improvement of both the primary and secondary roads, implementation of a
pilot ru.ral road mainter.ance program, preparation of a feasibility study
and, where justified, detailed engineering of selected roads, provision of
technical assistance to the Roads Department and to other organizational
entities and rehabilitation of 50 km of high-priority paved roads.
Implementation Experience
2.        Failure of the Government to meet certain conditions of
effectiveness in the loan and credit agreements (approved May 11, 1978) led
to delay in effectiveness and to the reappraisal of the project in July
1979 to reconsider these conditions and other factors. The Loan/Credit
became effective on November 26, 1979. Implementation was extremely slow,
the principal cause being the shortage of budgetary allocations for road
maintenance and the excessive time taken to prepare equipment
specifications and to order equipment.  Throughout the period of project
implementation, the recruitment of a large number of technical assistance
staff fell far short of the schedule for filling key staff positions. Two
studies financed under the project were completed satisfactorily although
they were delayed in starting. The pilot rural road maintenance component
was dropped before initiation as it was considered by Government to be a
low priority item. The rehabilitation of 50 km of high priority paved
roads was long delayed and never implemented. After extensive delays, a
substantial amount of road maintenance equipment was purchased and large
quantities of spare parts for rehabilitating existing equipment were
procured and used in equipment rehabilitation; unfortunately, the
utilization of the new and rehabilitated equipment in road maintenance was
poor. The actual cost of the project was US$23.09 million, less than the
US$26.70 million appraisal estimate but the project was not fully
implemented. Disbursements were slow because of slow project
implementation; not until FY87 was more than half of the US$23 million
total amount actually disbursed, and final disbursements did not occur
until FY88, after which the remaining US$2.9 million balance of the loan
was cancelled.



- vi -
Results
3.        The most positive result of the project was the augmentation of
new and rehabilitated road maintenance equipment in the Roads Department
inventory. Since, however, the resealing and regr&velling units were
frequently idle during the project implementation period, little was
accomplished in terms of road maintenance works. The principal objective
of the project therefore has not been realized. A secondary objective of
the project to plan for future extension of the road network was also not
realized; a road feasibility study concluded that the proposed road would
not be justified but the Government nevertheless undertook the design and
construction of the road. The project component designed to strengthen the
Mechanical Services Branch, a key institution affecting the roads sector,
had little impact as the study recommendations were largely ignored.
Sustainabilitv
4.        Road maintenance equipment has an estimated economic life of
about 10 years and most of the new equipment purchased under the project
was delivered between 1986 and 1987. The new equipment and some
rehabilitated equipment will therefore be available for use for a number of
years well into the 1990s, provided they are maintained in good condition.
Potential net benefits from the project over the period to about 1996/97
will depend on Government's future road maintenance budgets which finance
fuel and other necessities of the road maintenance units. The outlook for
realizing such benefits, however, is not promising.
Findinas and Lessons Learned
5.        For several years, prior to project appraisal, Bank staff
sought, in cooperation with the Roads Department, to design a project with
heavy emphasis on strengthening of road maintenance, thus clearly aiming at
the most urgent need in the highway subsector. In retrospect, the project
should have been delayed until senior Government officials were convinced
that this was the best highway project design. The Bank was right in its
assessment of the priority need for a project focussed on road maintenance
but it was wrong in its assessment that Government shared this conviction
of sector priorities. Throughout the period from Bank approval to the
closing of the project, the central issue was the need for adequate
budgetary allocations for road maintenance. The Bank demonstrated about
the right degree of flexibility in coping with the frequent shortfalls in
local funds. While 6overnment defended its low allocations for road
maintenance on the basis of the deteriorating general financial condition
of the country, the relatively generous allocations for new road
construction clearly indicates a different set of priorities. The
foregoing review indicates that much more dialogue is needed between
lenders and Government concerning: (1) a strong commitment to maintaining
the existing assets in roads by giving a much higher priority to highway
maintenance and avoiding new construction until the backlog of maintenance
has been eliminated and (2) the importance of road feasibility studies as a
basis for planning extension. of the road network.

THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
LOAN 1566-ZAICREDIT 798-ZA)
PROJE%JT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Third Highway Project, aimed largely at improving the
capacity for road maintenance works, was identified in 1972 and appraised
in mid-1977. Financing was negotiated in January 1978 and approved by the
Board in May 1978. A US$11.25 million Bank loan and US$11.25 million IDA
credit were made available for the project which was estimated at appraisal
to cost US$26.7 million. The Loan/Credit did not become effective until
November 1979 and implementation was slow. The final closing date was June
30, 1986, three years later than the original closing date of June 30,
1983; the final disbursements were made in August 1987 after which a
portion of the loan was cancelled. While the project resulted in a
significantly augmented road maintenance capability, the amount of road
maintenance performed was minimal because of insufficient Government
budgets for those works and deteriorating macroeconomic eniironment.
1.02      Transport sector development in Zambia is aimed at t-- primary
objectives, the first being to facilitate the movement of mineral products,
particularly copper, from the mining/processing areas to external markets.
Accordingly, substantial investments have been made by Government in rail
transport facilities along the central corridor from Livingstone in the
south via Lusaka to Kitwe and Ndola in the north. Government has also made
major investments in external transport considered vital to the trade of
this landlocked country. Since copper mining and export of minerals
dominate the Zambian economy both internal and external transport services
will continue to receive priority attention in the country's general
development.
1.03      The second major objective in the transport sector is to
facilitate agricultural production and rural development mainly in the
central corridor but increasingly extending beyond that area. Recognizing
that the mining industry will experience a continuing general decline in
the years ahead, the Government is taking steps to develop the agricultural
sector gradually to become, eventually, the engine of growth in the Zambian
economy. The country's economic outlook thus depends in large part on
agricultural expansion and rural development which in turn depends to some
extent on the improvement of transport.
1.04      Major transport improvements are very costly, and large
development programs in the sector tend to cause insufficient funding of
maintenance activities. In fact during the 1980s, budget allocations for
road maintenance in Zambia frequently fell far short of needs while
construction of costly new roads of doubtful economic viability went
forward. As a result of this shortfall in maintenance funding, the general



-2-
condition of the road network has deteriorated sharply with far reaching
economic consequences in terms of high costs of transport and relatively
slow speed of transport.
1.05      The dominant policy concern of the Zambian Government in the
transport field is to assure that copper, so -4ital to the economy, moves
expeditiously to external markets. C vernment seeks to maintain control of
external transport in various ways based on its ownership interest and
influence over Zambia Railways, the Tanzanian-Zambian Railway (TAZARA), an
oil pipeline linking a petroleum refinery in NdoLa to the port of Dar es
Salaam, and one large international trucking company. Private domestic
road haulage, particularly over short distances, is generally allowed with
limited regulation.
1.06      Recognizing in the late 1970s that the road network had
deteriorated badly as a result of neglect of adequate maintenance, the
Government sought, through the Third Highway Project, to overcome this
adverse trend. The project seemed to reflect a new intent on the part of
Government to reverse a policy of severely restricting the resources
available for road mairntenance; subsequent events, however, showed that the
Government is not yet fully committed to adequate road maintenance.
1.07      The information required for this report was obtained largely
from the Staff Appraisal Report, supervision reports, consultants and
Government progress reports and other materials in the Bank's files. The
principal det..ciency concerning the data required to prepare this Project
Completion Report (PCRa was the lack of a PCR prepared by Government.
Annual statistics on the kilometers of roads actually maintained, by
category of maintenance, were not available; such data would have provided
a better basis for assessing performance of the Roads Department.
II.  PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Oritin of the Prolect and Project Preparation
2.01      In 1972, about four years after the Second Highway Project had
bee- approved (see Table 1), the Third Highway Project was identified.
Ov,r a period of five years, the details of the project were defined and
the preparation completed (see Table 2). Project preparation was
accomplished by the Government largely through its Mechanical Services
Branch.
Appraisal of the Prolect
2.02      A partial appraisal of the project was carried out in March
1977, but the appraisal mission was unable to gain access to the Mechanical
Services Branch (MSB) and consequently a second appraisal months later was
required; the appraisal was thus completed in June 1977.

2.03      The objectives of the project were to improve the maintenance of
the rapidly deteriorating road network and to plan for future extension of
the network. The components of the project, as appraised in 1977, were as
follows:
a)   a program to improve maintenance of the primary and
secondary road network;
b)   a pilot rural road maintenance program;
c)   a feasibility study and, if justified, detailed
engineering of the Mansa-Kawambwa-Nchelenge road
(240km) or alternative roads agreed between the
Government and the Bank Group (see Map); and
d)   technical assistance to the Roads Department,
Mechanical Services Branch and the Ministry of Local
Government and Housing for operations and training.
Failure of the Government to meet certain conditions of effectiveness in
the loan and credit agreements led to delay in effectiveness and
reappraisal to reconsider these conditions and other factors. The number
of regravelling units to be equipped was reduced from 4 to 2, the number of
heavy maintenance units was reduced from 9 to 2 and the periodic
maintenance was reduced to cover about 375 km instead of the 750 km in the
original project design. An additional component of the project added at
reappraisal in 1979 was the following:
e)   rehabilitation of 50 km of high-priority paved roads.
2.04      The total project costs were estimated during the appraisal
mission at US$ 26.70 million, excluding taxes and duties but including
physical and price contingencies (see Table 5).  The foreign exchange
component was estimated at US$ 22.5 million or 842 of total cost.
Credit Negotiations and Subsequent Processing
2.05      Negotiations were held in January 1978 in Washingtoni.  No
significant disagreements arose in these meetings. The loan and credit
were signed on June 27, 1978. More than 18 months passed from Board
approval until the Loan/Credit became effective, on November 26, 1979,
because compliance with two covenants was long delayed. A covenant in the
Development Credit Agreement that certain staff be appointed by a specific
date was the initial cause of delay. An equally serious problem was the
covenant requiring the Government to budget specified amounts for road
maintenance. The project was reappraised in July 1979, easing the staffing
requirements and lowering the required budget levels; in November 1979, the
1980 budget allocation and assurances regarding future budgets were such
that the Bank Group deemed compliance sufficient for the Bank to declare
the Loan/Credit effective. These assurances were not subsequently borne
out, however, as the actual allocations in most years were much lower than
stipulated in the covenant.

111. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
3.01      A feature of the project design that caused a major delay in
project implementation was the requirement that Government fill four senior
staff positions and appoint 29 technical assistance specialists by
September 28, 1978. Since the Government would not employ a firm to
recruit technical assistance staff, it proceeded with the time-consuming
task of recruiting individuals. Undoubtedl>, the planned staff additions
would have been very useful had the project been implemented as designed
but it was unreasonable to expect the Government to recruit so many
individuals within the time allowed (4 months). In retrospect, the
covenant was not well-designed. It should have required the borrower to
employ a suitable firm to recruit the large number of personnel sought.
Otherwise, the number of consultants planned for the project should have
been substantially reduced.
3.02      Poor organization of the main Governmental entities carrying out
the project did not bode well for expeditious implementation. Cooperation
between MSB (transferred in May 1979 from Defense to Ministry of Works and
Supply as the Mechanical Services Department (MSD)) and the Roads
Department, the agency for which most of the repair work was undertaken,
was unsatisfactory.
3.03      In April 1982, the Bank suggested to the borrower that the
project be reappraised with a view to redesigning the project. The
Borrower, recognizing its limited financial resources, agreed in July 1982
that the prcject should be reappraised. Delays were experienced, however,
in securing consultants to undertake the necessary preparation.  In the
meantime, under the 1983 budget, the Government allocated recurrent funds
for road maintenance that were in line with the requirements of the
Loan/Credit Agreement, and therefore the project implementation proceeded
without reappraisal at that time.
Ph-sical Implementation of the Main Component
3.04      Implementation was extremely slow as indicated by the actual
rate of disbursements. At the end of FY82, when all the Loan/Credit funds
were scheduled to have been disbursed, the actual level disbursed was only
2Z of the total amount of the Loan/Credit. The principal cause of this
delay was the shortage of budgetary allocations for road maintenance and
the excessive time taken to prepare equipment specifications and order
equipment (see Table 11).
3.05      After long delays, a substantial amount of road maintenance
equipment was purchased (US$11.4 million); also large quantities of spare
parts for rehabilitating existing equipment were procured (US$2.9 million)
and used in equipment rehabilitation (US$5.6 million). Unfortunately, the
utilization of the new and rehabilitated equipment in road maintenance was
poor and consequently the primary objectives of the project were not
realized.   While statistics are lacking, indications are that only a small
fraction of the 2,000 km of paved roads targeted in the project were
resealed; likewise only a small proportion of the 375 km of gravel roads



- 5 -
targeted in the reappraisal were subject to periodic maintenance while
routine maintenance of all roads was far below the appropriate level. The
fact is that during the period of project implementation the backlog of
road maintenance increased rather than declined.
3.06      In July 1979, when the project was reappraised, the new
component was added to the project, that is, the rehabilitation of 50 km of
high priority paved roads. By March 1985, no work had been undertaken but
Government then requested that the Bank approve an increase to US$4.0
million for the allocation of Loan/Credit funds for this component.
Following Bank concurrence, certain works were tendered and the Ministry of
Works and Supply recommended award of contract to the lowest bidder; the
Bank had no objection but agreement on the award within the Government was
delayed so long that it became impossible to finance the works under the
project. Consequently, no expenditures were made for the project
component.
Implementation of Miscellaneous Components
3.07      Throughout the period of project implementation, the recruitment
of a large number of technical assistance staff fell far short of the
schedule for filling key staff positions. Government sought individuals,
rather than employ a firm for recruitment as repeatedly recommended by Bank
staff. Since some of the technical assistance staff were required to
implement equipment procurement under the project, equipment procurement
was also delayed. The latter problem did not, however, inhibit the
operations of road maintenance units significantly because Government
budgets did not provide sufficient funds for operating these units with the
existing equipment.
3.08      Two studies financed under the project were completed
satisfactorily although they were delayed in starting (see Table 9). The
recommendations of the MSD organization study, unfortunately, were never
implemented even though the report was accepted by the Government. The
feasibility study of the Mansa-Nchelenge road found the proposed
improvement not economically justified; yet the Government shortly
thereafter funded detailed engineering of the road and subsequently
arranged for construction with bilateral financing; most of the road has
been built.
3.09      In 1983, at Government's request and with Bank concurrence, the
pilot rural road maintenance component was dropped as it was considered by
Government to be a low priority item. No work had been initiated on this
component.
3.10      The consulting firm (Norway) involved in the road feasibility
study and the consultants (UK), which undertook the MSD organization study,
both performed satisfactorily as did, in general, the various individuals
participating in the technical assistance.

Proiect Costs
3.11      The actual cost of the project was US$23.09 million, some 132
less than the US$26.70 million appraisal estimate and 21Z less than the
US$27.90 million reappraisal estimate (see Table 5). As indicated
elsewhere in the report, however, the actual costs do not represent a full
implementation of the project as either appraised or reappraised.
Disbursements
3.12      The slow pace of the project implementation indicated above
resulted in a slow rate of disbursements (see Table 3). At the end of
FY82, when all the Loan/Credit funds were scheduled to have been disbursed,
the actual level disbursed was only 2% of the total amount of the
LoanlCredit. Not until FY87 was more than half of the total amount
disbursed and final disbursements did not occur until FY88 (about 132 was
cancelled). The US$22.5 million made availaBle by the World Bank Group for
the project was divided equally between the Bank and IDA, and priority for
disbursement was given to the IDA credit (see Table 6). All of the credit
was disbur_ed as was all except about US$2.9 million of the Bank loan, the
latter amount being cancelled.
Loan/Credit Covenants
3.13      Compliance with loan/credit covenants was not fully
satisfactory. The following summary indicates the status of covenants:

Performance of Borrower and Bank/Association
3.14      Borrower Performance.  As noted, the Government of Zambia was
not fully committed to the project; it did not share the Bank's conviction
that better road maintenance warranted greater local funding than in
previous years. While Government defended its low allocation for road
maintenance on the basis of the deteriorating general financial condition
of the country, the relatively generous allocations for new road
construction clearly indicated a different set of Government priorities.
The borrower even financed new roa" construction where either no
feasibility study had been done or such a study was undertaken and the
results proved negative.
3.15      The latter point is illustrated by the Mansa-Nchelenge road, the
study of which was financed under the project. Despite a negative finding
of the consultants, the road was built. Among a series of efforts to
prevent that construction, the Bank staff in 1985 trged that an updated
feasibility study be done before deciding to undertake the construction but
Government disagreed.
3.16      Performance of the borrower was less than satisfactory
concerning several other undertakings: (1) insufficient recruitment of
technical assistance staff based on individual recruitment rather than
engaging a firm; (2) largely ignored the recommendations of the MSD
organization study; (3) hindered procurement in some cases by denying the
use of letters of credit; (4) failed to submit some progress reports and
delayed the submission of many of the reports; and (5) failed to prepare
and submit a project completion report (see Annex B).
3.17      Bank Performance.  For several years prior to appraisal, Bank
staff sought, in cooperation with the Roads Department, to design a project
with heavy emphasis on the strengthening of road maintenance, thus clearly
aiming at the most urgent need in the highway subsector. In retrospect,
the project should have been delayed until senior Government officials were
convinced that this was the best highway project design. The Bank was
right in its assessment of the priority need for a project focussed on road
maintenance but it was wrong in its assessment that Government shared this
conviction of sector priorities.
3.18      Throughout the period from Bank approval to the closing of the
project, the central issue was the need for adequate budgetary allocations
for road maintenance. The Bank demonstrated about the right degree of
flexibility in coping with the frequent shortfall in local funds. At
reappraisal, it lowered the local funds requirement and relaxed staffing
requirements in the interest of enabling the Government to meet conditions
of effectiveness. It pressed for greater funds allocations before
-extending the closing date. Bank performance in supervision generally was
satisfactory.



- 10 -
IV. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
4.01      The component of the project designed to strengthen MSD, one of
the key institutions affecting the road sector, had little impact. While
the study undertaken was of good quality, the consultants recommendations
were largely ignored. Also, the large element of technical assistance in
the project, though not fully implemented, strengthened the MSD and Roads
Department staff considerably during the assignments of these specialists
but the impact in terms of human resource development was minimal.
4.02      One of the objectives of the project was to plan for future
extension of the road network. Toward this end, a project component
provided for a feasibility study of a possible 240 km road extension; the
consultants found the proposed development unjustified. The Government
nevertheless undertook the design and construction of the road. Thus, the
project did not have a positive influence on road network planning.
V. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
5.01      The 44% economic rate of return estimated at appraisal took into
consideration projected project benefits in terms of savings in vehicle
operating costs expected to be realized with improved maintenance of roads.
To date, the extent of road maintenance works accomplished has been far
less than anticipated (see Table 7); therefore, economic benefits have been
minimal and the economic rate of return, assuming continued poor
performance on road maintenance, is probably negative (see Table 8).
Specific data required to measure these benefits are not available. If the
Government in the future adequately maintains and utilizes the small amount
of remaining equipment procured under the project, the otherwise adverse
economic returns would, of course, be mitigated.
VI. CONCLUSION
6.01      The project was well conceived in that it focussed on the
strengthening of road maintenance, the priority need in the highway
subsector, and aimed at overcoming the major Roads Department weaknesses of
equipment and staff. Unfortunately, there was no shared conceptual
foundation for the project between the Government and the Bank as to the
priority for highway maintenance. It became apparent that Government at
all levels was not sufficiently committed to road maintenance vis-a-vis new
construction.
6.02      The most positive result of the project was the augmentation of
new and rehabilitated road maintenance equipment in the Roads Department
inventory. Since, however, the resealing and regravelling units were
frequently idle during the project implementation period, little was
accomplished in terms of road maintenance works. The principal objective
of the project, therefore, has not been realized. The new and



*         ~~-   11   -
rehabilitated equipment could nevertheless serve Zambia's road maintenance
well for several years, assuming the Government were to provide funds for
the correlated resource requirements of fuel, lubricants, bitumen, manpower
and other necessities to carry out road maintenance works. Unfortunately,
there are no indications that the Government is so inclined. The most
recent Roads Department budget reflects continued low funding for this
purpose.
6.03      One aspect of the project design that caused problems was that
the local cost component of project costs did not include all of the local
costs essential to carry out the project. In particular, the costs of
operating the road maintenance units (for which the project provided
equipment) were not included as project costs. Instead, the funding of
these costs was provided for in a covenant specifying minimum amounts of
funds to be provided in the Government's annual budgets for road
maintenance. The Staff Appraisal Report provided a detailed account of the
recur-:ent costs involved in operating the road maintenance units and these
costs formed the basis of the covenant. These specified budgetary amounts
were not met in the early years following project approval and consequently
a reappraisal was done and the requirements lowered significantly. Even
following this easing of the requirements, the covenant was seldom met and
this deficiency was the primary reason for the extremely long delays in
project implementation. Clearly, the covenant did not accomplish its
purpose; a better alternative might have been to include the essential
recurrent expenses for the project as project costs with Government
commitment to finance them.
6.04      The principal accomplishment of the project was to provide
substantial equipment and spare parts for roads maintenance, a much-needed
capability, but unfortunately the lack of correlated resource requirements
have prevented much impact in terms of actual road maintenance works.
6.05      Road maintenance equipment has an estimated economic life of
about 10 years and most of the new equipment purchased under the project
was delivered between 1986 and 1987. The new equipment and some
rehabilitated equipment will therefore be available for use for a number of
years well into the 1990s, provided they are maintained in good condition.
Potential net benefits from the project over the period to about 1996/97
will depend on Government's future road maintenance budgets which finance
fuel and other necessities of the road maintenance units. The outlook for
realizing such benefits, however, is not promising.
6.06      The foregoing review indicates that much more dialogue is needed
between lenders and the Government concerning: (1) a strong commitment to
maintaining the existing assets in roads by giving a much higher priority
to highway maintenance and avoiding new road construction until the backlog
of maintenance has been eliminated; and (2) the importance of road
feasibility studies as a basis for planning extensions of the road network.

Annex B
Pate 1 of 2
Borrower's Submission Concerning Completion
of the Third Hithway Proiect
1      As of January 30, 1990, the borrower had not submitted a PCR to the
Bank.  The latest written communication to the Bank on the subject was a
letter from the Director of Roads dated November 23, 1988 stating that,
"The text of the project completion report is still incomplete due to
various administration factors. It will be sent during December 1988".
Enclosed with the letter were two tables giving project expenditures, by
category and by supplier in US dollars only. Also included with the letter
was the Roads Department's Annual Report for the year 1986, issued in
December, 1987. A December 1989 Bank mission to review the transport
sector returned, without the Borrower's PCR.
2      In the absence of the Borrower's PCR, it may be useful to consider
relevant excerpts from the Roads Department's Annual Report for the year
1986.
3      Concerning the critical issue of the roads budget, the report
states, "The total authorized expenditures [for 1986]... was K104,815,402.
(Of this total], K81,832,701 was allocated for capital projects while
K22,982,701 was for recurrent expenditures. Of this (latter] amount,
K12,975,701 was for personal emoluments, leaving a balance of K10,007,000
for various departmental charges including maintenance materials. So only
10.5 percent of the total authorized expenditure was for actual road
maintenance which was again too low like in many past years".
4      As to project accomplishments, the report notes that, "The
Department's vehicles and equipment strength improved through... project
procurement of new vehicles and equipment, and spare parts for
rehabilitation of existing vehicles and equipment. However, [road]
maintenance activities slowed down since cost of materials such as bitumen,
cement, fuel and lubricants had risen by three hundred percent whereas the
financial provisions remained almost at the same level as (in] the previous
year".
5      The administrative staff zas said to be "satisfactorily filled" but
"the establishment for profess:Lonal engineers was very much under strength.
Of thirty-one authorized posts of engineers, only fifteen were filled".
6      With regard to the Mansa-Nchelenge Road, for which the project
financed a feasibility study (with negative results), the report states
that, "Forty-eight kilometers were completed in 1986 and opened to traf^ic
