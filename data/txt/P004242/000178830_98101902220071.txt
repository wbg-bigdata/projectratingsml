REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE NATIONAL ELECTRICITY BOARD
OF THE STATES OF MALAYA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF MALAYSIA
FOR A SIXTH POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the National Electricity Board of the States of Malaya (NEB) with
the Guarantee of Malaysia for the equivalent of US$45.0 million to help
finance a sixth power project. The loan would have a term of 20 years
including 5 years of grace with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report (No.217-MA) was circulated to the
Executive Directors in August, 1973. An annual economic mission visited
Malaysia in January/February 1974, and its report will be circulated in
due course. Country data for Malaysia are included as Annex I.
3.        With a per capita GNP of about US$400 (1971), Malaysia is one of
the most prosperous developing countries in Southeast Asia. The economy
has maintained fairly high rates of real growth, the GNP growing at an
average of about 6 percent a year during the last decade, with an increase
to 6.5 percent forecast for the first half of the 1970's. Exports, which
account for over 40 percent of GNP, have been growing at 4 to 5 percent a
year. The country's balance of payments position is sound. There are few
foreign exchange controls and external reserves are equal to eight months'
imports.
4.        Malaysia has significantly diversified its exports in the last
few years. Whereas in 1961 nearly 50 percent of merchandise export earnings
was derived from rubber, in the last few years only about one-third origin-
ated from this source. Timber and palm oil exports have risen substantially,
in 1973 representing an estimated 14 percent of merchandise exports. This
trend is expected to continue.
5.        It is too early to forecast with any precision how the world-wide
energy problems will affect the Malaysian economy, but it is unlikely that
Malaysia will suffer a shortage. In 1973 Malaysia's production of crude
petroleum was about 100,000 barrels per day, or 4.5 million long tons
during the year, and in about four years is expected to increase five-fold.
In 1973 Malaysia was still a net importer of petroleum products, at a net
cost of about US$40 million; however, based on present production and con-
sumption trends, Malaysia is expected to become a net exporter of petroleum
by 1977. Substantial reserves of natural gas have been found which in the
next few years will become an important foreign exchange earner. Malaysia's
hydroelectric potential is fairly large and detailed investigations of known
possible sites are being accelerated.



6.        Agriculture has accounted for about 30 percent of the country's
GDP and about 50 percent of employment but the manufacturing sector is
making an increasingly important contribution. During the Second Malaysia
Plan (SMP) period (1971-75), agricultural growth is expected to average
about 8.5 percent, while the projected growth rate for the manufacturing
sector is 14 percent. The manufacturing sector now accounts for 15 percent
of GDP, about 22 percent of merchandise exports, and employs 10 percent of
the working population.
7.        Although Malaysia achieved satisfactory rates of growth of pro-
duction during the 1960's, a decline of 20 percent in the terms of trade
reduced real income growth from 6 to about 4.5 percent per annum, result-
ing in a less than 2 percent increase in per capita income. This trend
continued into the early years of the present decade. However, during 1973
a boom in export prices improved the terms of trade, boosting real GNP by
about 10 percent, and leading to a real per capita income growth of 7 to
8 percent.
8.        Population growth rates will remain high for some time, around
2.7 percent per annum, accompanied by a growth in the labor force of about
3.3 percent per annum, but Malaysia's physical resources and employment
potential are great. The Second Malaysia Plan (SMP) projects an average
annual increase in employment of 3.4 percent accompanied by a reduction
in underemployment. In the longer term, over the next two decades, Malaysia
expects to reduce the unemployment rate from 7.5 to 4 percent. During this
period, the percentage of the labor force employed in agriculture is ex-
pected to drop from about 50 percent to 33 percent, and the percentage em-
ployed in manufacturing is expected to more than double, rising to 24 percent.
9.        During the last several years the Government's long-term plan-
ning has concentrated on the problem of reducing the economic disparity
between the Malays, who account for a little over half the population, and
non-Malays, who are predominantly Chinese. Over the next 20 years the New
Economic Policy, as it is called, aims to eradicate poverty and to restruc-
ture society so that the present identification of race with economic activ-
ity will eventually be eliminated. The basic outlines of the policy are
sound and allow for continued growth for each of the principal ethnic groups
while at the same time enlarging economic opportunities for Malays. The SMP
seeks to support these two objectives by encouraging economic growth.
10.       The SMP also reflects the Government's choice of a more vigorous
role for the public sector in the country's development effort. The revised
plan proposed an allocation of US$4 billion for public development expendi-
tures, twice the level under the first plan. The public sector's planning
and implementation capacity has been expanded, although several planning
and operating agencies still suffer from substantial manpower shortages.
The improvement in the Government's capacity to prepare and execute proj-
ects resulted in expenditures during the first three years of the plan
period that already exceeded the original plan allocation. The revised
plan levels anticipate a further strengthening of project identification
and implementation in the public sector. Most of the increased allocation



is earmarked to support the New Economic Policy, including among other
items (i) the expansion of the land settlement programs to provide employ-
ment opportunities, (ii) increased support to the manufacturing sector to
diversify the economy and to provide increased employment in higher income
jobs, and (iii) the provision of training and education to upgrade the job
opportunities of the low-income groups.
11.       During the first three years of the Second Malaysia Plan, 1971-73,
total public sector development expenditures amounted to about US$2.2 bil-
lion, of which 50 percent was financed by net domestic borrowing and 16 per-
cent by net foreign borrowing. The balance was financed largely by current
surpluses. The Bank has provided slightly less than 40 percent of the for-
eign loan commitments; bilateral aid, mainly from the United Kingdom, other
Commonwealth countries, Germany, Japan, and loans from the Asian Development
Bank, provided the rest. Domestic financing resources for the remaining
two years of the SMP are considered adequate. Gcvernment revenues are satis-
factory, accounting in 1972 for 22 percent of GNFo In addition, the Govern-
ment can readily borrow substantial amounts from domestic resources, notably
from the Government Employees' Provident Fund. The estimated external net
inflow requirements of public medium- and long-term loans will amount to
about US$190 million. New foreign loan commitmernts are expected to come
from the same sources with a significant increzae in Japanese lending. New
commitments from the Bank are expected to remain at about 40 percent of the
total. This level of foreign borrowing is well within Malaysia's debt-serv-
icing capacity. Debt service obligations at present are about 3.5 percent
of exports of goods and non-factor services and are estimated not to exceed
8 percent during the late 1970's. The Bank's share in Malaysia's debt serv-
ice payments is 22 percent and is expected to increase to about 25 percent
by the end of 1978.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAYSIA
12.       The Bank has made 26 loans to Malaysia for projects in education,
population, agriculture, forestry, industrial finance, power, water supply,
telecommunications, ports, railways, roads and urban transport. Although
in a few cases disbursements were slow, the execution of these projects has
generally been satisfactory. As of April 30, 1974 the loans to Malaysia
held by the Bank amounted to US$348.5 million. In addition, the Bank made
a loan in 1965 to the Public Utilities Board, Singapore (Loan 405-MA),
guaranteed by Malaysia, to finance the Johore River Project. The amount
held by the Bank under that loan is US$5.2 million. Seven loans are fully
disbursed. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC
investments as of April 30, 1974 and notes on the execution of on-going
projects.
13.       Bank assistance to Malaysia is intended to support the Govern-
ment's efforts within the framework of the New Economic Policy to redress
imbalances in rural and urban incomes, to create employment for the urban



- 4 -
unemployed, and to reduce rural underemployment. Since Malaysia's agricul-
tural development programs, including land development, irrigation and agri-
cultural credit, provide the most effective Government instruments for tackling
unemployment and income imbalances, the Bank will continue to give financial
support to these programs. So far, the Bank has made three loans for land
settlement projects in the Jengka Triangle area where about 100,000 acres of
land are being developed and about 10,000 smallholders are being settled and
one loan for land settlement in the State of Johore where about 4,500 fami-
lies will be settled. The Bank has also made two loans for irrigation, one
for the Muda Irrigation Project (Loan 434-MA) and another for the Kemubu
Irrigation Project (Loan 500-MA) both projects assisting low income rice
growers. In addition, the Bank will continue to assist Malaysia in the
critical fields of education to increase educational opportunities for the
rural poor. Also, the Bank will continue to assist in the financing
of infrastructure development that will improve conditions in the urban
areas and help support manufacturing. The Bank has helped the Government
to prepare projects either in the course of its lending operations or
by acting as Executing Agency for UNDP-financed studies. The Bank has
also helped to strengthen public agencies responsible for carrying out
important parts of Malaysia's investment program. We will continue this
policy, which will be reflected in the loans to be presented to the Executive
Directors in the next year or so. These loans would be for projects involv-
ing agricultural development, agricultural credit, agricultural research,
public utilities and infrastructure development. In agriculture, where the
foreign exchange content of projects is often small, the Bank will continue
to cover a portion of local costs.
14.       IFC has been active in Malaysia since 1963 and has made five
investments totalling US$8.7 million (Annex II). The total commitments
under those investments held by IFC as of April 30, 1974 amounted to
US$4.5 million. The Corporation has under preliminary consideration a
wood processing and a pulp and paper project.
PART III - ELECTRIC POWER IN MALAYSIA
The Sector
15.       Demand for electric power has been growing on the average by about
14 percent annually over the last 10 years. Industry and mining were the
largest users in 1973, followed by commercial and residential demand. Power
is supplied principally by autonomous government-owned entities, the largest
being the National Electricity Board (NEB). NEB serves Peninsular Malaysia
with the exception of part of the State of Perak, which is supplied by the
privately-owned Perak River Hydroelectric Power Company (PRHE), and of Penang,
which is supplied by a municipally-owned plant. The Sabah Electricity Board
and the Sarawak Electricity Supply Corporation supply the two states on the
island of Borneo. Total capacity installed by these entities at present is
as follows:



-5-
Entity                    Installed Capacity (MW)
NEB                                      845.0
PRHE                                     142.5
Penang City Council                       43.3
Sabah Electricity Board                   88.6
Sarawak Electricity
Corporation                             54.0
Total                        1,173.4
In addition, there was a total of about 25.5 MW in about 126 diesel plants
owned by small electric companies, which supply power to customers on a
licensed basis, and of about 19 MW of small privately owned diesel units.
16.       The power market served by NEB has grown steadily in the past
with a 16 percent average annual increase in total sales from FY1963
through 1969, 12 percent in FY1970, 10 percent in FY1971, 15 percent in
FY1972, and 14 percent in FY1973. Energy sales for the next ten years
are expected to increase at an average of around 13 percent per annum,
starting with a 20 percent growth rate in FY1974 and then gradually
levelling off to 10 percent by FY1983.
17.       PRHE, incorporated in the United Kingdom, operates under a con-
cession granted by the State of Perak in 1926 for a term of 80 years. The
Government has decided to exercise its right of take over under the con-
cession agreement and NEB is expected to acquire the company's assets in
November 1976. The Penang City Council operates the electricity system
for the island of Penang under special provisions of the Electricity Act
of 1949. The system is interconnected with the NEB system. No further
generating units will be added by PRHE or Penang and demand will in the
future be met by bulk purchases from NEB. Thus, only NEB will provide
generation plant capacity in Peninsular Malaysia in future and will supply
the entire Peninsula except for minor licensed plants.
18.       NEB's total generating capacity of 845 MW consists of about 265 MW
of hydroelectric plant, 540 MW of steam plant, and 40 MW of diesel plant.
NEB's present expansion program includes the completion of Stage III (3 x
120 MW) of the Port Dickson Thermal Power Station; the construction of the
Temengor Hydroelectric Plant with the initial installation of 2 x 87 MW
generating units to be commissioned in early 1978 and the installation of
two further 87 MW units at a later date; the installation of 3 x 120 MW
additional units at the Prai Thermal Power Station to be brought into serv-
ice during 1979-81.
19.       NEB's interconnected system covers most of the western side of
Peninsular Malaysia. Links to Kuantan, Kota Bahru and Kuala Trengganu on
the east coast will be completed between 1975 and 1980 when the entire
peninsula will be interconnected (see map). A rural electrification pro-
gram which started in 1957 is being accelerated under the Second Malaysia



Plan (1971-75), at the end of which over 3,000 villages with about 240,000
customers are expected to be served. Finance for the program is provided
one-third each by the Federal Government, the appropriate state government,
and NEB. Project costs for calculating Government and state contributions
include expected operating losses for the first seven years. The program
is small relative to NEB's overall operations, and has no significant influ-
ence oni NEB's financial position.
20.       NEB's development program is based on a system study in which a
number of alternative sequences of generation, transmission, and distribu-
tion were compared. The study was carried out by consultants, Preece,
Cardew, and Rider (PCR), a British firm, in cooperation with Shawinigan
Engineering Company (SHENCO), a Canadian firm. A further study is now being
undertaken to define system development after 1981, taking into account ex-
pected higher fuel costs for thermal stations and the results of ongoing
studies on potential hydro sites. SHENCO also prepared studies on the
Bersia and Kenering hydroelectric projects, downstream from Temengor on
the Perak River. The Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority (Australia)
completed a pre-investment study in 1969 on the Pergau hydroelectric scheme;
a group of Russian engineers is carrying out a study of the Sungai Tembeling
scheme; and a study of the combined flood control and power development proj-
ect of the Trengganu River is being planned.
21.       NEB has received a total of about US$140 million in five Bank
loans since 1958, which will have helped, on the completion of current Bank
financed projects to finance 1,010 MW generating plant additions and asso-
ciated transmission lines. The projects under the first four loans have been
completed and are operating very well. Under the fifth loan, for the third
stage of the Port Dickson station and transmission facilities, delays in
the manufacture and delivery of equipment have occurred, and the commission-
ing date for the first unit is now expected to be early 1976 about 22 months
behind the original schedule. The systems in both Sarawak and Sabah are
being assisted by ADB loans.
The National Electricity Board
22.       The National Electricity Board, which was established in 1949
by the Government under the provisions of the Electricity Act enacted that
-ear i.5 a financially sound, well-organized, and well-operated utility.
.   both a regulatory and operating agency charged with operation of the
electric installations under its jurisdiction and the establishment of such
new facilities as may be required. It regulates the production and use of
electric energy in Peninsular Malaysia and grants licenses for the installa-
tionI and operation of independent electricity works to be used for public
or private purposes. The Board of Directors are appointed by the Minister
of Works and Power, subject to terms and conditions he may determine. The
Board is headed by a chairman and a deputy chairman, who is also general
manager. The management structure has recently been reorganized with the
principal changes affecting the middle-management level.



-7 -
23.       NEB has a comprehensive staff training program which is run by
its own Education and Training Department. Since 1960, 362 engineering
scholarships have been sponsored at overseas universities, mostly in
Australia and UK; of these, 132 have so far graduated and returned to
Malaysia. In addition to scholarships at the college level, NEB has an
apprenticeship scheme for technical staff, and a training center is being
planned on a 200-acre site at Bangi next to the Public Works Department's
proposed training center. In-house courses are run to train supervisors
and others in modern techniques of supervision and methods of work. Senior
personnel attend overseas seminars, and others are sent abroad for post-
graduate study.
24.       NEB has the power to fix tariffs without reference to any other
authority. In practice, the Minister of Works and Power is consulted and
he has the right to give directions of a general character not inconsistent
with the provisions of the Act. These provide that total revenues must be
sufficient to meet total costs, including depreciation and interest. This
is regarded as determining the minimum level of tariffs. NEB's stated
policy is to produce a return on its average net fixed assets in operation
of at least 8 percent-per annum and to finance at least 40 percent of
construction costs out of internal resources. The commitment to earn a rate
of return of at least 8 percent has been incorporated in the Bank loan
agreement (see Section 5.05).
25.       NEB's financial position has been sound. Since FY1966 the rate
of return on reasonably valued average net fixed assets in operation has
varied between 8.8 percent (1969) and 11 percent (1967); the rate of return
was 12.1 percent in FY1973. Local construction costs have been wholly met
from internal cash generation since 1966 as were portions of the foreign
costs, together aggregating about 60 percent of total investment in plant
and facilities. Debt service coverage on an annual basis was 2.6 times
(1973). The debt/equity ratio improved from 61/39 in FY1966 to 45/55 in
FY1973, indicating a satisfactory capital structure; the current ratio in
FY1973 was an adequate 1.6.
26.       NEB has recently decided to enter into joint ventures for the
manufacture of electrical equipment such as electric meters, cables, trans-
formers and switchgear for which NEB would be 'the main customer in the early
years. Day-to-day management would be provided by the foreign partner. The
proposals are at a preliminary stage, but NEB is expected to provide about
half the total investment required which is estimated at a maximum of US$11
million equivalent. It is small in relation to NEB's overall program and
well within its capability. The loan agreement contains a covenant
(Section 5.08) providing for the Bank's concurrence to any industrial
participation by NEB, whether in the form of equity, loans or otherwise,
when such participations exceed US$11 million equivalent in aggregate.



PART IV - THE PROJECT
Hlis tory
27.       The proposed project is part of the Temengor Hydroelectric Scheme
on the upper Perak River in the State of Perak. The feasibility studies for
this scheme were carried out by SHENCO and financed by Canadian bilateral
assistance. The scheme comprises a hydroelectric station and transmission
lines. The hydro station, estimated to cost US$101 million, consists of
a rock-filled dam approximately 375 feet high which will create a reservoir
of 4.6 million acre-feet, a Dower intake leading to four power tunnels and
oenstocks, and an outdoor powerhouse containing four 87 t. turbogenerating
units of which two wlll be installed initially and two at a later date. The
average annual output of the station will be about 908 million kwh. Also,
there will be substantial flood control and downstream irrigation benefits.
The access road has already been completed and the main civil works contract
has been awarded to a Japanese contractor. Most of the financing for the
dam and power station has been obtained from bilateral agencies. The
proposed project forms the second part of the schere and consists of the
transmission lines and the substations. Tt was appraised in October 1973.
Loan negotiations with NFB and the Government were held in Mlay 1974.    The
Malaysian team was led by Mr. Yahaya bin Abdul Wahab, Under-Secretary
(Finance) of the Ministry of Finance. A loan and project summary is included
in Annex III. The Appraisal Report 347a-MA dated June 20, 1974 is being
circulated separately.
Description
28.       The proposed project will transmit the power output of Temengor
to the major load centers of NEB's interconnected network. About 132.5
miles of 275 kV lines and associated stations would be built to link up
Temengor with NEB's system at Papan and extend the main system southward
from Port Dickson (see map). In order to transmit power generated by
Temengor to the ultimate consumers, the associated transmission and dis-
tribution system under 275 kV will have to be extended. Six lines of a
total length of 178 miles together with terminal equipment will be included
in the project. In addition, the project also includes the establishment
of a control and load dispatching center and consulting services.
29.       The Temengor-Papan transmission lines and substations will inter-
connect the Temengor power station with the western network by means of a
double circuit of 275 kV transmission lines with duplex 300 ml ACSR conductors
terminating at Papan. The route length will be approximately 94 miles. The
Port Dickson-Malacca transmission lines and substations will form part of
the link between the central and the southern networks. Design will be the
same as above but the line will be operated initially at 132 kY. The route
length will be approximately 38.5 miles.



-9-
Cost and Financing
30.       The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$68.5
million. This estimate is based on known costs of similar works completed
or being constructed under previous Bank loans, after allowing for increases
in materials and equipment costs and field conditions. Physical contingen-
cies of about 10 percent for overhead lines and 7 percent for substations
are considered adequate. Price contingencies of 11 percent for 1975, 7.5
percent for 1976 through 1979 have been included to cover price escalation
during construction.
31.       The proposed Bank loan of US$45 million equivalent would cover the
foreign exchange component or about 66 percent of total project cost. The
balance of US$23.5 million equivalent (34 percent) for local costs would be
financed by NEB from retained earnings. The project represents 10 percent
of NEB's 1974-80 capital expenditure program.
32.       The Bank contribution to the financing of the integrated Temengor
Hydroelectric scheme amounts to about 27 percent of the total cost of
US$169.5 million. The total cost of the dam and power station components
is estimated at US$101 million. Finances for a major part of this scheme
has been arranged as follows: a loan from the Japanese Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund (OECF) of US$48 million equivalent (3-1/4 percent for 20
years including 7 years of grace) covering the foreign and part of the
local cost of civil works; a loan of US$12 million equivalent (7-1/2 percent
for 23 years including 5 years of grace) from the British Commonwealth
Development Corporation (CDC) to cover local costs, and a loan from the
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) of US$3 million equivalent
(3 percent for 30 years including 5 years of grace) to cover engineering
and supervision costs. Electrical and mechanical equipment with a cost of
US$14 million equivalent is expected to be financed through suppliers'
credits. The rest of the financing is expected to come from internal cash
generation.
Implementation
33.       NFB will be responsible for the implementation of the project.
The consultants (PCR) have completed engineering studies and specifications
for the 275 kV lines. Tenders have been called and awards will be made late
in 1974. Manufacture, construction, and commissioning will take about 33
months. Completion is scheduled for 1977 to coordinate with the target
commissioning date of the first Temengor generating unit. PCR is responsible
for the preparation of bidding documents and supervision of construction.
Construction will be by contractors.
Procurement and Disbursement
34.       The equipment and materials to be financed under the proposed loan
would be procured through international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines, with the exception of the line pro-
tection system which will be procured from manufacturers whose products have



- 10 -
given proven performance (about US$35,000). The latter equipment is of a
sophisticated natture, and the characteristics are very specific. Local manu-
facturers would be allowed a margin of preference of 15 percent or the actual
customs duty, whichever is lower.
35.       Disbursement would be made against (i) 100 percent of the c.i.f.
cost of imported equipment; (ii) 100 percent of ex-factory cost of equipment
manufactured locally; (iii) 70 percent of equipment procured locally but
manufactured abroad; and (iv) 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of
constulting services. Local manufacturers do not appear likely to be success-
ful in bidding for contracts financed under the loan but to the extent they
are, some financing of local expenditures would be involved.
Justification
36.       Consultants' studies of the generation and transmission expansion
have demonstrated that the sequence of development proposed is the least
cost solution to meet the load requirement up to 1981. It includes the
Temengor Hydroelectric Development, the Prai Thermal Power Station extension,
and the associated transmission facilities. The transmission lines proposed
are the only possible ways of transmitting the power generated from the
Temengor and Port Dickson plants to the major load centers. The proposed
sequence of development (including generation and transmission) was found
preferable to any other sequence at discount rates up to 13 percent.
37.        It is not possible at this stage to determine the detailed
implication of future fuel oil availability and price increases, particu-
larly on system expansion, demand, and financial forecasts. However, since
the scheme consists of the development of hydroelectric energy, its justi-
fication cannot be adversely affected.
Financial Forecasts
38.       Projections of future revenues have been made on the basis of
the forecast average annual sales growth of about 14 percent up to 1980.
Operating expenses are forecast to increase at an average growth rate of
23 percent.   Thus, contributions to construction are not expected to
continue at the high level of 60 percent achieved in the past, and will
-robabl-y be about 46 percent for the period FY1974 through 1980. However,
this will be sufficient to meet local costs and to provide adequate work-
ing capital.
39.       Except for 1974 when fuel surcharges will not apply, the rate of
return on average net fixed assets in operation is estimated to be lowest
in 1979 (9.4 percent); for all other years through 1980 it is estimated to
exceed 11 percent. The capital structure will remain satisfactory through-
out the forecast period. Cash generation will cover requirements and
enable NEB to maintain an acceptable debt/equity ratio of about 46/54.      The
current operating ratio is expected to increase from 67 percent in 1973
to 80 percent in 1980. Debt service coverage on an annual basis will be
greater than 2.0 times during the period.



40.       The Government, as part of its policy to combat inflation, has
kept electricity tariffs including fuel surcharges, at the levels that
prevailed hefore the fuel crisis. The position will be reviewed later in
the year and a decision will be taken whether to pass on fuel price increases
to consumers. If NEB earns the minimum 8 percent rate of return stipulated
in the Bank loan agreement, a finance gap of about M$ 270 million in FY1975
through FY1980 would result. This gap would be covered by the Government.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS ANT) AUTHIORITY
41.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the National
Electricity Board, the draft Guarantee Agreement between Malaysia and the
Bank, the report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4
(iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of the draft Resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft Loan Agreement conforms to the normal pattern for
loans for electric power projects.
42.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan complies with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VT - RECOMMFNDATIONS
43.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION-1/
Loan No. 533   Jengka Triangle Project; US$14.0 Million Loan of
April 17, 1968; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Loan No. 672   Second Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project; US$13.0
Million Loan of May 20, 1970; Closing Date: Xay 31, 1977
Loan No. 885   Third Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project; US$25.0
Million Loan of March 30, 1973; Closing Date:  December 31, 1981
The projects consist tf the clearing of forest, the planting of
62,000 acres of oil palms and 3!;,000 acres of rubber and the settlement of
10,000 families in the Jengka Triangle (State of Pahang). The Federal Land
Development Authority (FELDA), responsible for the execution of the project,
operates efficiently and its standard of planting and maintenance is high.
The first project (533-MA) has been completed. Cost overruns are estimated
to have been about US$5 million or 20 percent of appraisal cost estimates,
of which about US$3 million is due to the US$ devaluation. The Second Jengka
Project (672-MA) is also mostly completed. But, due to timber shortages,
the housing program is somewhat behind schedule. Cost overruns are estimated
at about US$3.5 million or 10 percent of appraisal cost estimates of which
about US$3 million is due to the US dollar devaluation. In terms of economic
viability, improved prospects for palm oil and rubber prices have fully
compensated for cost overruns on both projects. The Third Jengka project
is proceeding satisfactorily and is somewhat ahead of schedule.
Loan No. 673   Jen&ka Forestry Project; US$8.5 Million Loan of May 20,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1974
Implementation of the project, consisting of a highly complex
integrated forestry products industry established in the Jengka Triangle,
suffered because of management and technical problems, which were both
traced to the lack of previous experience of this kind in Malaysia. How-
ever, corrective steps were taken and performance, both managerial and
financial, has since been satisfactory. No postponement of the Closing
Date is presently expected.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced eval-
uation of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Page 4 of 6
Loan No. 700   Fifth Power Project; US$20.0 Million Loan of
July 16, 1970; Closing Date: January 31, 1975
Implementation of the project consisting of extensions to existing
thermal plants of the National Electricity Board system were delayed because
of manufacturers' delays, particularly in supplying structural steels and
turbo-alternators. The Closing Date of this loan will have to be extended.
Loan No. 753   Second Telecommuurications Project; US$18.7 Million Loan
of June 21, 1971; Closing Date:  June 30, I976
The project includes facilities and equipment to improve the do-
mestic and international telecommunications systems. Implementation has
been delayed but better progress is now being made and there are reasonable
prospects that the project will be completed on schedule.
Loan No. 561   Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Project; US$3.6 Million Loan
of September 27, 1968; Closing Date: September 1, 1974
Loan No. 908   Second Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Project; US$13.5 Million
Loan of June 14, 1973; Closing Date:  June 3G, 1978
The projects consist of the improvement and expansion of water
supply facilities in the Kuala Lumpur area. Implementation of the first
project had been delayed because the main civil works contract had to be
retendered following the death of the main contractor and the liquidation
of his firm. Costs were within the original estimates and work has been
completed. However, the Closing Date had to be postponed for a second time
to September 1, 1974 to allow for the payment of retention monies. The
original Closing Date was September 1, 1972. Tenders for certain parts of
the second project have been awarded and site investigations for the pro-
posed dam are now completed.
Loan No. 599   Education Project; US$8.8 Million Loan of
May 23, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1974
The project will provide in 21 new schools about 11,000 student
places, of which about 2,500 will be in Sabah and Sarawak for secondary
education and teachers training and about 8,500, mainly in Peninsular
Malaysia, for vocational, technical and agricultural education. Project
implementation generally is about six months behind schedule, due to some
siting problems and to staff shortages in the Public Works Department which
delayed preparatory design nrocesses, but is now progressing well. All but
one of the 21 project institutions should be completed by end 1974. A start
on the construction of the remaining project item, one of the three agricul-
tural schools in Peninsular Malaysia, was considerably delayed by difficulties
in obtaining a suitable site. Although the site is now acquired and con-
struction has already begun, the Closing Date will require postponement.

Loan No. 810   Second Education Project; US$15.5 Million Loan of
April 5, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1977

education in Malaysia, started under the first project, will be continued
by the construction of 8 schools, providing 4,700 student places, and by

about 2,600 student places. The project includes also the establishment of
an educational center which will provide a curricula improvement course for

satisfactory.
Loan No. 774   Sabah Ports Project; US$16.1 Million Loan of
June 30, 1971; Closing Date: June 30.L 1975
The project consists of the construction of new ports at Kota
Kinabalu and Sandakan in the State of Sabah. Construction is behind sched-
ule, initially due to mobilization delays caused by the seamen's strike in
Japan and the staffing difficulties arising as a result of the project
manager's death and more recently due to difficulties in the supply of raw
materials.
Loan No. 799 Railway Project; US$16.0 Million Loan of
February 11, 1972; Closing Date:  December 31, 1975
The project includes mainly equipment and works for a dieseliza-
tion program of the Malayan Railways (MR). Implementation is behind sched-
ule by about one year because of the Railways' management problems and its
initial unfamiliarity with the Bankts procurement procedures, MR is in the
process of hireing consultants to help at in improving its management.
Loan No. 851   Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project; US$16.0 Million
Loan of July 20, 1972; Closing Date: A&ril 30, 1977
The project is designed to improve access to Kuala Lumpur from
the adjacent town of Petaling Jaya. Project implementation is behind
schedule mainly because of the management problems of the main contractor.
The Government and the contractor are expected to take remedial measures
shortly.
Loan No. 880   Population Project; US$5.0 Million Loan of February 9,
1973; Closing Date: September 30, 1978
The project is designed to assist Malaysia in achieving low
birth and population growth rates and thus to contribute to an increase
in per capita income growth and in the long run to ease the unemployment
problem. The United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) is
providing US$4.3 million in the form of a grant to finance certain compo-
nents of the project. Progress is satisfactory after initial difficulties
in coordinating activities of the Government agencies involved, which has
delayed loan dibursement.
