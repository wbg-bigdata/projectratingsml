Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The present study has been granted by the International Development Association, Grant No.
TF025537. CES Consulting Engineers Salzgitter GmbH has been contracted on 11 July, 1999
by the State Amelioration and Irrigation Committee (SAIC) to conduct the "Environmental
Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Areas of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main
Mill Mugan Collector".
According to the national environmental legislation the project executing agency, SAIC, is
responsible for the assessment and the monitoring of environmental impacts caused by the
project. This study assesses the present and future environmental situation in both project
areas and proposes an environmental monitoring programme as required by the legislation.
This programme forms the basis for the regular observation and assessment of environmental
key parameters in both project areas.
On 4 August, 1999 a workshop was carried out by SAIC to find a common understanding of
monitoring relevant topics, the participants represented different institutions involved in
environmental affairs, e.g. the State Committee on Ecology and Control on Natural Resources
Utilisation (ASCE). During the workshop the environmental monitoring was discussed and
key parameters were agreed upon between SAIC and the participants (Annex C).
The monitoring areas have been defined during the workshop. The MMMC monitoring area is
bordered by the Araz river south west to north east, by Karabakh Canal in the south west. The
collector drain K3, Ag gol and Sarisu lakes together with the Kura form the northern borders
of the monitoring area. The SAC monitoring area is bordered by the upper 50 km of the SAC
in the west, the Caspian Sea in the east, the international border to Russia in the north and the
Velvelichay river in the south. Finally the SAC area was extended to the southeast to include
also the area of the Deveci Lake which is located approximately 20 km southeast of the
bottom end of the SAC reach to be rehabilitated.
Three public consultants meetings were held during December 1999 to inform local
organizations and stakeholders about the proposed program, the monitoring program and the
environmental management plan, and to hear their views and suggestions (see Annex D).
MILL MUGAN COLLECTOR DRAIN
The Mill Mugan Collector Drain (MMCD) is a long-term scheme to drain the right bank of
the Kura River. At present the upper part of this area, irrigated by the Karabakh Canal, is
drained through a siphon under the Kura River into the left Shirvan Collector Drain. In
consequence, the left bank collector is over-loaded and drainage in its service area is impeded,
and this also backs-up into the right bank area. Additionally, drainage water is discharged into
the Kura River to relieve the over-loading in peak periods. This raises the salinity level in the
Kura adversely impacting on Baku water supply, which is partly taken from this source.
The lower part of the right bank area, the Mugan-Salyan plain, has a separate collector drain
already constructed to an outlet further south on the Caspian Sea.
The proposed project is to construct the 31 km missing link between this lower right bank
collector and the upper part, so relieving the existing drainage congestion described above.
There will be a positive impact on the right bank area drained by the lower section of the Mill-
Karabatch Collector Drain, immediately above the connection with the MMCD, and the

service area of the left bank Main Shirvan Collector Drain. The project will also construct all
the associated structures, bridges, service road and a siphon under the Araz River.
Additionally the project will provide for rehabilitation of deteriorated collector drains feeding
into the new section of the MMCD, servicing some 36,500 ha.
The Project Area
The immediate project area surrounding the 31 km of missing link in the MMCD which will
be constructed under the proposed project comprises (a) 36,500 ha of irrigated land which will
be drained directly into the new section, and (b) about 20,000 ha of non-arable, unirrigated
and undrained land, mostly rough pasture and swamps bordering the Sarisu lake, lying to the
north of the new construction. This area includes some of the most saline land in Azerbaijan,
resulting from a high ground water table, around 2.0 m in spring and summer which is not
addressed by the current poor and impeded drainage system.
Two sensitive and protected areas are in or near the project area, these are:
*  Ag-Gol Lake, a 9,173 ha protected area containing a 4,361 ha shallow lake and reed
swamp located about 20km upstream of the immediate project area. This was designated a
RAMSAR site in 1976 for the protection of resident and migratory birds. Ag-Gol lake
receives, and is sustained, by drainage water from the Karabakh irrigation system. A
regulator controls the water level in the Ag-Gol lake, and discharges through a channel to
the Sarisu Lake.
* Sarisu Lake, which is a very shallow water body and reed swamp of around 6,500 ha
located in the immediate project area, between the proposed MMCD and the River Kura.
Although only a restricted area, the Sarisu Lake is nevertheless important for migratory
and resident birds. Currently, about 10,000 ha of land south of the lake is drained by
pumping into Sarisu lake, and thence through an outfall into the Kura River. This drainage
water is considered responsible for the high salinity of the lake and also contributes to the
salinity of the Kura River.
Impacts during Construction
Construction impacts will be negligible provided nornal good working practices are observed.
Contractors would be required to prevent, minimize or mitigate environmental damage.
Bidding documents would have environmental precautionary clauses.  An additional
requirement is that de-watering operations contractors should discharge drainage water into
existing drains to avoid contamination of soil and fresh water resources.
Impacts during Operation
For the agricultural land in the immediate project area, and in the wider area of influence, the
effects of the proposed project are entirely positive. The seasonal drainage congestion will be
relieved and consequently water logging and salinity will be correspondingly decreased. With
the reduction of drainage discharge into the Kura River the salinity in this river will decrease
with a positive impact on the ecology of the river as well as on Baku's water supply.

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Ag-Gol lake is outside the area of influence of the project, as the backwater effect in the
Mill Karabahk Collector, originating at the siphon crossing the Kura River, does not extend to
this lake. Water levels in the adjacent drains, and therefore also groundwater levels are
unaffected, as is the water supply into the lake. Nevertheless, Ag Gol lake has been included
in the proposed monitoring program because of its hydraulic link to Lake Sarisu. Depending
on the future water supply replenishment needs of Lake Sarisu, Ag Gol may become a more
important source of water for Lake Sarisu.
The Sarisu Lake is affected by the proposed project. There will be three impacts:
* The new 31 km section of the MMCD to be constructed will cut across the natural
catchment area of Sarisu Lake, reducing it by about 4,000 ha;
* The drainage water from an irrigated area of about 1 0,000 ha which is currently pumped
into Sarisu lake will in future discharge by gravity into the new main collector;
* The new collector will lower groundwater levels along its route, and may marginally
(marginally, because the new collector is 6 km from the lake at its nearest point) increase
seepage losses from Sarisu Lake.
The consequence for Sarisu Lake is a reduction of inflowing water. As the lake is very
shallow, and is probably perched above the groundwater level (due to the proximity of the
Kura River), there is a risk that the inflow from the Ag-Gol lake is insufficient to maintain the
water balance. There are no records of inflows and outflows to Sarisu Lake, so this possibility
cannot be eliminated.
An additional impact is the switching of about 25 m3/s drainage water from the left bank
outfall into the Caspian Sea to the more southern right bank outfall. This is not considered to
be a significant factor, but monitoring of the outfall point will be included (refer below).
SAMUR APSHERON CANAL
The Samur Apsheron Canal (SAC) has the dual function of transmission of water from the
Samur River to contribute to the needs of Baku City and the Apsheron Peninsular as well
meeting the irrigation requirements of 95,000 ha. The SAC, which was constructed around
1955, comprises a diversion structure on the Samur River and a 180 km concrete lined canal
with associated works, siphons, aquaducts and offtakes. Pumpstations at the end lift water to
a reservoir from which the Baku water supply is abstracted. The Samur River forms the
northern border with Dagestan, and the SAC canal runs south along the edge of the foothills,
irrigating the coastal plain, 20km from the Caspian Sea in the north, reducing to less than 5.0
km nearer Baku.
Long term neglect of maintenance, most acute in the last decade, has left the SAC in a very
vulnerable condition, no longer able to guarantee an uninterrupted supply to Baku or to
maintain a reliable irrigation service. In particular the mechanical components, the gates and
lifting gear, at the diversion and other structures along the route, and sections of the canal
lining are seriously deteriorated. The proposed project will rehabilitate the most critical
components in the SAC canal, including the gates and lifting gear at the diversion, the
diversion structure, sediment treatment works, damaged lining and structures over the upper
50 km of the canal.

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Government of Azerbaijan has long-term plans for development of the SAC to guarantee
the Baku water supply to 2020+ and to expand irrigation. The proposed project is compatible
with these plans, but is limited to maintenance, and re-establishment of the established
service. It will not finance any expansion works.
The impacts of the proposed project will be: (a) to arrest the deterioration in the irrigation
service; (b) to restore long-term reliability of water supply to Baku and irrigation; (c) reduce
losses in the first 50km of canal; and (d) correspondingly marginally increase the supply of
irrigation water in the lower reaches of the canal, where the shortages are currently most
acute.
The Project Area
This coastal strip commanded by the SAC has a gross area of about 180,000 ha, and a
population of around 300,000, mostly located in small towns and villages along the main road
to Dagistan and Russia which runs parallel and close to the canal. In addition to the 95,000 ha
irrigated by the SAC there are areas irrigated by local sources, and extensive pasture areas
close to the coast. There are three protected areas in the region, comprising:
*  Qusar State Protected Area of 15,000 ha located adjacent to the Samur River, and
intersected at its lower corner by the SAC canal, so that only a small part is within the
SAC command area. This area is dedicated to the protection of grey partridge, pheasants,
roe deer, wild boar and hare from hunting;
• Yalama Liana Oak Forest of 20,000 ha close to the coast, and adjacent to the Sumar River,
is a conservation area for a unique residual forest of broad leaf trees linked to "liana" type
creepers.
* Deveci Lake, a 3,500 ha shallow lake in a 7,500 ha reserve close to the coast at about km
70 on the SAC canal, being an important water body for aquatic birds and fish production.
Impacts - Operation
Construction impacts will be negligible provided normal good working practices are observed.
Whilst rehabilitation of the headworks and part of the main canal will be executed in the
Qusar State Protected Area, no significant impact on the wild-life of this reserve is anticipated
as the inmmediate surrounds have long been affected by the irrigation facilities and the close
proximity of the main highway through to Dagestan and Russia. The other sensitive areas are
not close to the proposed rehabilitation works.
Impacts - Operation
The project's effects on the area will be almost exclusively positive. The extended functional
life of the diversion and canal will eliminate the immediate risk of a serious collapse of the
irrigation service and the water supply to Baku. The reduction in losses and improved
irrigation distribution will improve equity amongst farmers, and the beneficial effects of
additional water will be felt at the lower end of the canal where the service is least reliable. In
the upper areas seepage losses and over-supply of irrigation water will be reduced, with a
beneficial effect for the area: a lower water table, less stagnant water ponds and a lower risk of
salinity.

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Operation of the system will have no significant effect on the Qusar State Protected Area, the
Yalama Liana Oak Forest or the Deveci Lagune.
The Deveci Lake is currently seriously affected by irrigation, as the stream naturally feeding
the lake is diverted for local minor irrigation unconnected with the SAC system. With
improved management, and the reduction of losses in the SAC, the project may have an
opportunity to improve the hydraulic regime of the lake by reduction of the area's dependence
on the local stream for irrigation. Under the proposed project the situation will be monitored,
and the possibility for improving the situation explored.
Monitoring Programme
The environmental monitoring programme is proposed to get an exact picture as possible of
the situation before, during and after the implementation of the MMMC and SAC projects.
This allows to define actual project impacts and to design effective mitigation measures. The
programme comprises annual campaigns of data collection (statistical data and field
observations), data assessment and reporting. It is proposed to start in early 2001 at least four
months before construction and to last 8 to 10 years in total. At least, until the end of the
project implementation it should be carried out by SAIC. The monitoring will comprise the
observation and assessment of:
* Natural parks and biodiversity
* Hydrological and Hydrogeological flow regimes
* Soil degradation and land-use
* Water quality
* Health
* Socio-economy
In both project areas 15 points are proposed for hydrometric observations, 5 points for regular
groundwater observation, 17 points for analysis of surface and groundwater quality and 20
points for soil sampling. Socio-economic surveys are proposed to be carried out in two
representative districts. Details are found in Chapter 4.
MMMC Area
In the MMMC area the monitoring programme considers the water balance and quality of the
Ag Gol and Sarisu lakes, their natural habitats and biodiversity, the water quality of the Kura
and Araz rivers, as well as the water quality of the MMMC sea outlet (on-shore and off-
shore), groundwater level and quality, soil degradation and land use in the Mill plain as well
as the socio-economic and health conditions of the Imishli district.
Hydrometric observations, comprising water levels of the two lakes and their inflowing
collectors and canals (9 locations) as well as groundwater metering (5 locations) will be
carried out at short time intervals (e.g. daily, weekly or 10 days). EC, pH and temperature as
standard water quality parameters will be collected at the two lakes in short intervals, e.g.
weekly. Complete quality surveys of the lakes, rivers, collectors, canals and of the sea outlet
will be carried out annually. Plant and bird life at the two lakes will also be observed annually

at critical periods. After six years a satellite image based land use survey is proposed. For the
assessment of socio-economic conditions 2-year field surveys are suggested. Health
conditions are proposed also to be analysed at two year intervals on the basis of statistical
information.
SAC Area
The proposed monitoring concentrates on the Deveci Lake which may benefit in the future
from the rehabilitaiton of the SAC. The lake water level will be monitored at short term
intervals (e.g. weekly) and water samples will be collected and analysed annually. In addition
hydrometric observations are suggested for Shabranchay river that feeds the lake, and for the
SAC at its upper reach. For both locations annual water quality analyses are considered.
Soil degradation and land use will be monitored as well as socio-economic and health
conditions for which the Khachmaz district will serve as an indicator for the monitoring area.
A satellite image based land use survey is proposed to be carried out after six years. For the
assessment of socio-economic conditions 2-year field surveys are suggested. Health
conditions are proposed also to be analysed at two year intervals on the basis of statistical
information.
Institutional Arrangements
To steer, administer and to conduct the monitoring programme an environmental monitoring
unit (REMU) is proposed to be established under the existing hierarchy of the SAIC as a sub-
unit of the RIIDIA II Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The REMU will be responsible for
reporting to the SAIC, which should inform ASCE. The REMU is proposed to have 2 regional
data handling units in the project areas. It will co-ordinate and collaborate with the
governnental organisation and institutes, such as ASCE, Committee of State
Hydrometeorology, etc. It will make consultancy agreements with the third parties (e.g. private
institutes and organisations) to carry out the monitoring programmes.
TQ set-up the REMU monitoring programmes for hydrological and geo-hydrological, soil
quality, water quality, health situation and socio-economic key parameters (including
Geographic Information System, GIS) would require a tentative total investment of
approximately $US98,000. This amount includes the costs for a three months assignment of
an intemational expert. The annual operational costs of REMU, including all monitoring costs
would total about $US26,000. This amount includes annual operation costs and staff costs, as
well as consultant costs. The investment costs would lower to approximately $US86,000 if no
GIS group would be implemented at REMU. In that case the annual costs would drop slightly
to about $US25,000. The above mentioned costs are tentatively as discussed with the client.
They are based on 1999 cost levels and do neither consider physical and price contingencies,
nor do they consider costs for intemational freight and tax/customs. The cost savings are
considered insignificant compared to the overall budget. In view of this the Consultant
recommends a GIS equipped REMU. This approach should facilitate a modern data handling
and an efficient enviromnental monitoring.

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector  INTRODUCTION
1. INTRODUCTION
,Environmental monitoring can be used as an effective tool for the sustainable
management of the environment. The objective of a monitoring programme is to obtain
as accurate a picture as possible of the situation prevailing within any particular time-
frame in order to determine whatever action is necessary on the basis of results obtained.
In the framework of the Feasibility Study for the Rehabilitation and Improvement of
Irrigation and Drainage Infrastructure in Azerbaijan Project (RIIDIA II), the
construction of the new Main Mill Mugan Collector (MMMC) and the rehabilitation
and reconstruction of the Samur Apsheron Canal are proposed. The MMMC project is
found in the Kura - Araz plain, it deals with the construction of a section of a drainage
collector which will form the missing link in the right bank drainage system of the Kura
river. The SAC rehabilitation project is located in the foothill zone of the eastern
Caucasus, its purpose is to improve the conveyance capacities of the canal which feeds
irrigation areas and the Baku water supply system.
Between January and February 1999 an environmental impact assessment (EIA) has
been carried out for RIIDIIA II Project in the MMMC and SAC project areas. The EIA
study stated that environmental impacts of the RIIDIA II Project are mitigable. It also
proposes monitoring of the environmental impacts of the RIIDIA II project, which is a
prerequisite for project implementation according to the national legislation.
The International Development Association (IDA) granted the present study
"Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area of the Samur Apsheron
Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector" Project with number TF025537. The
Consultant, CES Consulting Engineers Salzgitter GmbH, has carried out the study,
according to the contract dated 11 June 1999 and signed by the client, State
Amelioration Committee (SAIC) on behalf of the Government of the Republic of
Azerbaijan.
The purpose of the study is to assess the present situation of the environment in the
MMMC and the SAC Project areas, to show the future impacts of the both of the
projects; to assess the need for the monitoring of environmental indicators; and finally
propose an institutional structure for an environmental monitoring programme and to
estimate the set-up and annual operation costs for the programme.
Thus, within the framework of this study the SAC and MMMC project areas are being
analysed, not only to set up a monitoring programme, but also the technical and the
budget requirements as well as the institutional requirement for the monitoring system.
Also a workshop has been organised on 4h of August 1999 to identify responsibilities of

the relevant organisations and institutions as well as to obtain knowledge on baseline
information.
The present report shows the results of the environmental assessment and the layout of
the proposed monitoring system, comprising monitoring programme, institutional set-up
and budget needs. Therefore the report is organised as follows:
An executive summary gives in short the main findings and outcomes of the study, it
also shows the overall budget requirements for set-up of the monitoring and for its
annual operation.
After this brief introduction the second section works out the assessment of the present
environmental conditions for both project areas. The main fields of investigation are
natural parks and biodiversity, surface and groundwater, soil degradation and land use,
water quality, health situation and socio-economic aspects. For all mentioned aspects
potential future project impacts are addressed.
The third section elaborates the monitoring programme for both project areas. This
includes the organisational set-up of the environmental monitoring unit, the elaboration
of environmental key parameters as well as their monitoring schedule, staff
requirements, equipment and laboratory needs, report regulations and the respective
budget requirements.
The fourth section proposes an optional Geographic Information System (GIS) for the
RIIDIA II Environmental Monitoring Unit (REMU). The details of this section cover the
objectives of GIS, its institutional and staff requirements and budget needs.
In the last section overall monitoring budget needs for the RIIDIA II Environmental
Monitoring System (REMS) are introduced. It shows the set-up costs and the
operational costs on an annual basis.

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector  ASSESSMENT
2. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
2.1   GENERAL
Environmental impacts of the construction of Main Mill-Mugan Collector (MMMC)
and of the rehabilitation of the Samur Apsheron Canal (SAC) are predicted to be
mitigable according to the Environmental Impact Assessment Study that was carried out
during the RIIDIA II Feasibility Study in early 1999. A general assessment of the
present environmental situation is performed in the following paragraphs, these also
assess the expected effects of the project on the environment. For the assessment of the
present situation, the previously elaborated environmental impact assessment forms the
basis.
2.1.1 MMMC Monitoring Area
The MMMC project is by its character a drainage project. The section of the Mill
Mugan Collector proposed for construction under the Project forms a missing link of
about 31 km length. It will connect the Mill Karabakh Collector to the Mill-Mugan
collector on the right bank of the Araz river. Closing of the gap will ultimately affect
more area than can initially be served by existing drainage infrastructure. The surface
potentially affected by drainage improvements contains ultimately about 576 000 ha,
and is geographically equivalent to the Mill-Karabakh sector. In addition, the Mill-
Mugan collector is a prerequisite for the successful drainage upstream of the two initial
phases of the Shamkir project.
The delineation of the MMMC project area is agreed upon in the workshop held on 4
August 1999 (see Annex C) as: the Araz river from south west to north east, the
Karabakh Canal on the south west and K3, Ag gol and Sarisu lakes together with the
Kura form the northem borders of the project area. The MMMC area that is to be
monitored covers an area of approximately 168 000 ha, its delineation is shown in
Figure 2.1.
The ecologically important Sarisu lake may be affected by the cutoff of catchment area
of the Sarisu lake. Another lake, Ag Gol, forms part of a strictly protected State Reserve
of the same name, but is located upstream of the proposed collector drain and outside its
area of influence. At present, the lakes are fed by drainage water being discharged from
irrigated areas supplied by the Karabakh Canal.

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector  ASSESSMENT
For both lake areas the preservation of the present surface water level is essential to
assure the ecological function of the lakes. At present the water levels are controlled out
by hydraulic structures (weirs) at the outlets of the lakes. Although Ag Gol is not
influenced by the new drain, it is included in the proposed monitoring program because
of its water supply functions to Lake Sarisu.
The positive effect of the Main Mill Mugan Collector Project consists in the socio-
economic benefits due to increased agricultural production. Indirect benefits are
expected from the improvement of the Kura river water quality, from which the potable
water supply of Baku profits, as well as the fisheries and sturgeon hatcheries in the Kura
mouth near Neftchala.
For the evaluation of the above mentioned mitigation measures and for the control of
their effectiveness a monitoring system with periodic observations and assessments is
needed. The main elements of this system will cover natural parks and biodiversity
(especially Ag gol State Protected Area), hydrological water balance of the Ag Gol and
Sarisu lakes and of groundwater, soil degradation and land use, water quality of the
Kura and Araz rivers and of the outfalls of the Mill-Mugan / Mugan Salyan Collector
into the Caspian Sea as well as health situation and socio-economic aspects. The
monitoring should be carried out on the basis of the R1IDIA II Environrnental
Assessment Study and on the basis of present assessment which is shown for the present
and future situation starting with chapter 2.2.
2.1.2 SAC Monitoring Area
The SAC project is to be characterised as an irrigation and water supply project. The
proposed infrastructural measures comprise the rehabilitation of the existing SAC on its
upper reach between the Samur intake weir and the downstreamr crossing Velvelichay
river and the rehabilitation of the secondary canals.The impact area of the present
project, intending to rehabilitate the upper 50 km of the Sarnur-Apsheron Canal has
been agreed upon in the workshop held on 4 August, 1999 as: the area that is
surrounded by Samur-Apsheron Canal in the west, the coast line of the Caspian Sea in
the east, the border line in the north and the Velvelichay river in the south. Additionally
the area of the Deveci Lake, located 10 km southeast of the Velvelichy river is included
also. According to these borders the SAC monitoring area covers approximately
126 600 ha from Samur to the Velvelichay and additonal 47 000 ha south of the
Velvelichay with the 5 800 ha Deveci Lake. The delineation of the SAC monitoring area
is shown in Figure 2.2.

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector  ASSESSMENT
The SAC Monitoring Area comprises 3 areas of ecological importance, these are the
Yalama Oak Forest, The Qusar Hunting Reserve and the Deveci Lake. Apart from these
three areas, it is a major zone of irrigation dependent agricultural activity.
The unique residual forest of oaks in the coastal zone of Yalama does so far not possess
any nature protection status. With the improved irrigation water supply in the future
young tree plantation may be better served.
-The upper 8 km reach of the SAC passes through the Qusar hunting reserve. During the
project construction phase this area may be affected marginally in the vicinity of the
construction site. However, after the rehabilitation of the SAC, there will not be any
additional environmental stress due to the existence of this canal, compared to the
present situation.
Additional irrigation water will increase the agricultural production capacities and the
use of fertilisers and other agrochemical. This may effect the quality of the ground water
and also the quality of the surface water.
Similar to MMMC area, a monitoring progranmme will be needed for evaluation of the
environmental impacts of the infrastructural measures. The monitoring system will
concentrate on the Deveci Lake, its inflow and water level and its water quality. In
addition soil degradation, land use and health and socio-economic aspects will be
observed to deliver data that can also be used for the project monitoring. The monitoring
should be carried out on the basis of the environmental assessment that was carried out
during the RIIDIA II Environmental Assessment Study and on the basis of the baseline
data that was elaborated during the present assessment which is shown in the following
chapters for the present and future situation.
2.2   NATURAL PARKS AND BIODIVERsrrY
2.2.1 General
The information related to the flora and fauna characteristics of the MMMC and the
SAC project areas have been collected from ASCE, the National Hunting Agency, and
their respective district offices, and from the Zoological and Botanical Institutes of the
Academy of Sciences.
District offices of ASCE are regularly monitoring natural parks and rare and endangered
species of the natural flora and fauna. During the field trips it has been observed that the
technical staff, equipment and vehicles were not sufficient to cope with the monitoring
requirements, especially in the area of the Ag gol lake. The district office which is
responsible for the monitoring of the Ag gol lake vigils the central protection area as
well as a peripheral wildlife conservation area by three observation posts located in the
south, west and east of the areas.

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector   ASSESSMENT
2.2.2 MMMC - Monitoring Area
The State Protection Area and State Reserve of Ag gol, Bozkobu swamp and Sarisu lake
Hunting Reserve are located in the MMMC project area (Figure 2.1). The ASCE
manages the Ag gol State Reserve, whereas the others are managed by the Hunting
Agency. Some of the rare and endangered species listed in the Red Book of Azerbaijan
-are found in the MMMC monitoring area.
To assess the present situation of the MMMC monitoring area the scarce or endangered,
endemic and non-endemic floristic and faunistic species are taken into consideration.
The assessment is carried out according to the Red Book of Azerbaijan. The following
three categories were taken into consideration:
* I Category: Endangered species; special measures should be taken into account to
protect and sustain these species.
* II Category: Species decreasing in number; measures should be taken into account,
these species may be endangered.
* III Category: Species in limited number and in limited area; if they have
unfavourable conditions they may be endangered.
2.22.1 Present Situation
The direct zone of influence of the project encompasses the Araz river's left bank
irrigation sectors of Imishli, Saatli and the lower sectors of the Beylagan rayon. A small
portion of Sabirabad district is included south of the Kura river. A great part of the
considered project area possesses irrigation infrastructure and is under some form of
agricultural use. Natural flora and fauna established, often called weeds, are therefore
the follower and ecological complement of human activities, thus it does not represent
in this region species of exceptional rarity or in danger of extinction.
The state reserve area has been founded in 1964, it is situated east of Agjabedi and
borders to the north on the Mill Karabakh collector. The purpose of the establishment of
this 9 173 ha area as a state reserve was to protect natural habitats of migrating birds and
of other birds and of mammals. However, the regulations set to protect this area were
not sufficient to protect the environment required by these species. Therefore a part of
that area (4 400 ha) having stricter rules has been established in 1978, as the Ag gol
State Reserve Area. Further 782 ha have been added to the reserve area, in 1987.
The Ag Gol lake was considerably affected between 1985 until 1987 by the decrease of
lake surface area and by the drying out of swampy areas which consequently affected the
natural habitats. After that time the lake recovered. The water surface area of the lake

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector  ASSESSMENT
was 8 176 ha in 1987 (satellite images). From the 1998 satellite images it can be taken
that the water surface area increased to 9 281 ha. If the suggested remedial water
resources management measures (chapter 0 on Water Resources) are carried out, the
water quality of the lake is likely to improve. According to the ASCE district office the
number of the birds and of other animals would benefit immediately from this.
The Ag gol lake possesses also potential for the breeding of commercial fish species.
Seventeen groups and more than 140 species of birds live in Ag gol and its surrounding
area. Eighty-seven groups of birds are nesting. Approximately 500 000 birds are
wintering in the area. (See Annex A.21)
Six groups and 15 species of mammals, 8 species of reptiles, 4 species of amphibians
and 12 species of fish live at the Ag gol state protected area. From that fauna 20 species
of the birds, 2 species of reptiles, 3 species of amphibians are listed in the Red Book of
Azerbaijan. Greylag goose, white tealed are some of the species nesting only in that area
of the country.
The vegetation around the water-swamp areas has been dominated by dense southem
reed. Some water plants in the lake area are: myriophyllum spicatum and verticcaliatum,
Potamogeton crispus and Potamogeton lucens. Ceratophyllum demersum, Utricularia
vulgaris, Najadaceae and others are also typical for that region. In lake Ag gol 42
species of water vegetation have been observed. The reed bands within the lake border
are 500 m wide, due to the shallowness of the lake. The maximum depth of the lake is
2.5 m it average depth is 0.8 m.
According to the results of observations made by the Agjabadi Local Authority of
ASCE in 1998 there are 40 species of plants. Eighteen of them are the components of
true swampy types, 22 of them form part of semi-desert phytocoenosis. Annual grass,
perennial grass and bushes compose 50 %, 45 % and 5 % of the total plant area,
respectively.
According to the 1998 information, obtained from the District Office of ASCE the
ageing process of the reeds (forming 90-92 % of the flora of the Ag go)l is slow. For
1998 it is also reported that reeds dried in the central area and in the shore areas of the
lake.
In a 2 ha sized Kardon named part the Bibersitein mountain tulip is found, it is in the
Red Book of Azerbaijan. [ASCE, 1998, Report of the Ag gol State Protection Area,
Agjabedi]
The present conditions are observed by a dedicated but underpaid staff living in difficult
conditions on the site and doing a credible job of protecting the area against poachers
and illegal fishing. Due to a refugee settlement north of the Mill-Karabakh collector and
because of cattle and wildlife bridges which cross the collector cattle can intrude into
the reserve area. However, this is tolerated by the park authorities.

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector   ASSESSMENT
Changes in the water quality of the Ag gol lake resulted in the disappearance of the
following 2 fish species: sif and breams.
Ag gol discharges its water over a weir to the Bozkobu Swampy area. Bozkobu swampy
area as a hunting reserve has a protected area of 10 000 ha including a sanitary
protection zone of 500 m. The Bozkobu area is formed mainly by swamps with reeds.
The swamp area is the nesting, feeding and resting place of wintering birds. This area is
of similar omitofaunistic importance as the Ag gol and Sarisu lakes.
The Sarisu lake belongs to the system of ecologically highly interesting lakes of the
Kura-Araz lowlands, although it is not included in Azerbaijan's protected areas. The
Lake area is approximately 14 000 ha of which water and swampy areas form a surface
of 6 570 ha. Its maximum length is 22 km, whereas its width is about 6 km. Its average
depth is 0.9 m which indicates a shallow shape.
Due to the unfavourable water quality conditions of the Sarisu lake (see chapter 0) only
reeds can grow in the lake. The lake has at least the same ecological significance as Ag
gol. It offers a large open water surface as well as a dense belt of reeds and swamps,
with large swarms of aquatic birds. But population pressure is high on the northern
shore, due to the proximity of the Kura river permitting intensive irrigation by motor
pumps. Besides a number of villages exist, their population is fishing and hunting in the
lake area. The lake is considered a hunting zone, hunting and fishing requires a special
licence, which can easily be obtained as it is said.
Similar to the Ag gol area, the control of the water level of the Sarisu lake is of crucial
importance for aquatic flora and fauna. For this purpose, a weir regulates the water level
by releasing water via a short collector to the Kura.
2 2.2.2 Potentialfuture Project Impact
The construction activities require the use of heavy machinery, heavy lorry traffic and
selective pumping for groundwater evacuation. These will cause noises, vibrations and
the production of exhaust gases that could cause temporary disturbances of wildlife.
When the new main collector is constructed, it will pass through treeless agricultural
areas and steppe with low density of wildlife. This will be of very reduced significance.
The area occupied by construction activities in comparison is very small to the
encountered uniform steppe area. So natural vegetation will not be harmed to a great
extent.
No direct influence is expected from construction activities for all Ag gol lake and
Sarisu lake, as the construction site will be more than 60 km respectively to 10 km
away.

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector  ASSESSMENT
After the new main collector is constructed, it will form a new line of separation in the
landscape. Wildlife trails will be cut. Due to the necessity of inspection and
maintenance roads alongside the collector, traffic generated with some disturbance
effect. Effects though will be minimal due to low density of wildlife and the limited
traffic and also mitigated by the necessity of transit bridges for cattle and wildlife.
The lakes in the region are very sensitive to the change of the surface water level.
for the Sarisu lake, intercepting of the drainage flow will deprive the lake of a certain
proportion of surface inflow needed to maintain an ecologically sustainable water level.
It is not clear at the moment whether this inflow exceeds the outflow of water into the
Kura river. Inflow-outflow measurements will be a main component of the monitoring
programn. Lowering of the groundwater table by the proposed MMMC will only occur
in the near vicinity of the MMMC. Due to fine textured soils of the area and the distance
of about 10 km between Sarisu Lake and the MMMC the lake is not likely to loose
water by filtration to the MMMC.
For the aquatic fauna any lowering of the lake's water level would have serious effects.
The extreme heating up of the lakes in summertime up to 40 °C would be affecting the
deeper portions of benthic life at the sea bottom. Due to lower dissolving capacity of
oxygen at higher temperature deplete oxygen reserves for the water resource. This could
lead ultimately to the death of underwater flora and fauna under anaerobic conditions
(the lake system collapses).
2.2.3 SAC Monitoring Area
There are three specific areas located in the SAC monitoring area. These are the Qusar
State Protected Area, the Nabran-Yalama-Khachmaz Liana-oak Forest and the Deveci
Lake. The present natural flora and fauna characteristics of these areas has been
assessed.
Qusar State Protected Area is managed under the authority of ASCE, by means of a
District Office. Deveci lake is managed by the Hunting Agency, and the above
mentioned forestry area is managed by the Forestry Agency having a regional office in
Yalama.
The assessment of the flora and fauna characteristics of the monitoring area is mainly
based on the Red Book of Azerbaijan.
2.2.3.1 Present Situation
Eighteen animal and 12 plant species found in the SAC area listed in the Red Book of
Azerbaijan. (See Annex A.22).

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector   ASSESSMENT
Most of the project area is irrigated and under intensive agricultural use. Natural flora
and fauna established, often called weeds, are therefore the follower and ecological
complement of human activities, thus do not represent in this region species of
exceptional rarity or in danger of extinction. Most rivers carry mountain stream fish on
their upper reach, the lower reach not forming a permanent habitat due to water use for
irrigation or intermittent seasonal flow. For the fish resource of the Samur river
facilities have not existed for 40 years to cross the weir structure.
-In 1964, the Qusar State Protected Area was established between the Samur and
Qusarchay rivers at the Qusar district of the Azerbaijan Republic. The purpose was to
prevent and restore the number of grey partridge (perdix perdix), pheasants
(phasiaunus), roe, wild boar and hare. The total area of the state protected area is 15 000
ha. It has a length of 28 km at south-west to north-east direction and a width varying
from 12 to 15 km, from north-west to south-east.
Approximately 2 325 ha of this area is covered by forests. In that area there is also 2 400
ha of vineyards and orchards. Approximately 4 % of total area is occupied by pasture,
and 3.1 % of this area constituted by creeks, small canals, footpath and other roads
(Figures takes from RIIDIA II EIA, 1999).
All of the protected area is impacted by human activities. Approximately 70 % of this
area is occupied by villages and farms. Additionally 19.4 % of it is used as pasture and
3.4 % are formed by irrigation canal roads, and etc. [Aliyev H.E., Hasanov X.N., Baku,
1993]. The protected areas are established on areas where forestry, agriculture and other
practices are allowed, usually on a temporary basis. In any case, the economical activity
in the protected area should not damage the protected objects. Within the Qusar State
Protected Area agricultural activities, irrigated area, the Samur weir and heavy vehicle
traffic on the main road to Russia could be observed during field trips.
The Qusar State Protected Area is directly affected by the Samur-Apsheron Canal, as it
passes through its lower, easternmost part. The main highway with the principal traffic
between Baku and Dagestan and Russia is running nearly parallel to the SAC, which
may result in some disturbance and cutting of wildlife trails.
Deveci Lagune, a groundwater lake situated in a depression in the coastal plain, is a
precious waterbody of importance for fish production and a habitat for many aquatic
birds, endemic and migratory. This area has been protected and managed under the
authority of Hunting Management. Totally protected area is 7 500 ha and 5 800 ha
(Satellite data of 1998) of it has been occupied by the lake. The mean depth of the lake is
around 50 cm, whereas the deepest part is 2.5 m.
At present it is fed by the Shabranchay of good water quality but insufficient quantity,
and it does posses a direct outflow to the sea. In the summer season, when the irrigation
water is used from Shabranchay river the water level of the lake drops down due to
evaporation and unhindered outflow.

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector    ASSESSMENT
The lake has suffered in 1998 near complete drying out with a consequent impact on the
fish population and impact on the wildlife feeding on them. The Fish population is now
recuperating. Fortunately fish will also enter via the sea outlet. Drainwater of
agricultural areas in the irrigated watershed above the lake, including the heavily
contaminated waters of the Devecichay at present are intercepted by a collector drain, so
that they do not enter the lake, but are led to the sea. Water quality in February was very
saline EC 7.87 (about 5 gl1). At that time eutrophic conditions of the lake were observed
by the consultant, which manifested itself by abundant green algae and dense, thick reed
-bands (- 200 to 400 m at both sides of the lake).
Due to water scarcity, repeated attempts have been made to divert collector water to the
lake, but-perhaps a mixed blessing- because of high salinity content of the drainage
water. They have failed due to lack of technical means.
With improved management, and the reduction of water losses in the SAC, the project
may have an opportunity to improve the hydraulic regime of the lake by reduction of the
area's dependence on the local stream for irrigation.
Further sensitive areas potentially influenced by the project are the Yalama Liana Oak
Forest in the north-eastern coastal plain near Nabran, Mukhtadir, Khachmaz and Yalama.
This forestry area occupies 20 000 ha area, it is controlled by the Forest Management Unit
that is located at Yalama under the jurisdiction of the Azerbaijan Forest Agency. This
represents a unique residual forest of broad-leaved trees, mainly oaks of impressive
stature covered frequently by "liana" type creepers, among them ivy. Liana-oak is
widespread in Nabran region. In the past the area has been decreasing rapidly due to
grounds belonging to some kolkhoz that had initiated deforestation on 5 000 ha where
the soils were of good to very good agricultural potential. However, this process is being
reversed now, land being partly sold back (500 ha) to the Forest Agency. Land reformn
has given the surrounding farmers their own ground, so there is no actual pressure on
the forest, especially as they have little means of investment.
The fauna and types of trees of this forest are given at Annex A.23. This liana-oak forest
contains a lot of species of trees, as well as relic and endemic ones. Each year an area of
120 ha is planted especially with young trees of oak, walnut, acacia, chestnut, etc.
Irrigation water needs to be given for establishment due to the dry climate, even though
the ground water table is around I m below surface. On the other hand, each year 2 500 m3
of wood is allowed to be gathered and sold out. One-hundred-fifty m3 of this timber has
high quality (-$US 100 per 1 mi3) and is used as raw material for constructional works and
furniture. Remaining part is sold to the villagers for their heating purpose.
According to the Plan for the Establishment of State Protected Areas and Natural Parks
(1982 - 2000), establishment of the Shahdag Natural Park is also planned, including
14 400 of the Nabran Lina-Oak Forests.
Resorting and camping activities are allowed within the described areas of the forest. At
the coastal area camping zones are rented at 4.700.000 Manat/ha/year. Picnic activities are

free of charge but these areas are permanently controlled. Hunting within the forest area is
allowed, if the necessary permission is obtained from the hunting authority.
Still cattle and pigs use the forest as pasture and illegal incursion of hunters are
registered, so there is a requirement for improved vigilance equipment, personnel and
facilities.
At present the surrounding agricultural lands receive water from the off-takes
.downstream of the Samur river canal off-take. Potentially, after canal and river off-take
rehabilitation, more irrigation water might be available, which could contribute to
renewed pressure on the forests.
It has been reported by the Fisheries Agency that the rivers located in the SAC
Monitoring area are very important from the point of fishery economy. Especially
Velvelichay, Qudyalchay, Qarachay and Qusarchay rivers distinguished from others by
their ichiofauna. These rivers are very important for the local fishing. The semi-
migratory fishes of Caspian Sea, such as snake-fish (Caspiomyzon Wagner) migrate into
these rivers to spawn.
The utilisation of water of these rivers in the villages, for irrigation, drinking and other
purposes have created the rough conditions for the river ecosystem. Therefore presently
these river fisheries can not sustain their interest. Also the increase in the amount of the
harvested fishes has reverse impacts on the ichiofauna of these rivers.
2.2.3.2 Potentialfuture Project Impact
The contractors will need to establish cleared sites for camps, material dumps, access
roads and site excavation itself. Wildlife may be driven away by noises, emission and by
human and vehicle traffic. Drawdown of water in construction pits might affect adjacent
grounds reducing water availability for sensitive vegetation. The spillage of pumped
water into inadequate drains might cause on the other hand waterlogging.
The damaged concrete lining will be removed and needs to be deposited at a site
different from the Qusar Hunting Area. If this is not performed, it may harm the see-see
partridge (francolinus francolinus) living in that area. Francolinus francolinus is known
to be one of the endangered species listed in the Red Book of Azerbaijan. If it is
decided, after the preparation of the comprehensive sediment plan for the canal system
cleaning of the two desilting basins, located at km 6 and km 12, this may require the
development of adequate landfills to dump approximately 7 million m3 of non-
contaminated Samur sediments. These landfills would need to be designed before start
of the construction works. Their locations should be selected to minimise transport
distances and related traffic, the operation of the landfills should be covered by a
specific management plan to ensure a regular operation and to minimise environmental
disturbances. Considering the present condition of existing disturbances by heavy road
traffic, no significant additional effects on what little remains of wildlife is likely.

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector  ASSESSMENT
The Samur Apsheron Canal passes through the easternmost part of the Qusar State
Protected Area Conservation area for about 15 km. Construction noises, heavy
construction traffic emission dusts and gases may have considerable potential
disturbance and nuisance impact to wildlife. Personnel at the construction camps will be
apt to take up a ready opportunity for hunting to enrich their fare. Yet considering the
present condition of existing disturbances by heavy road traffic, no significant additional
effects on what little remains of wildlife are likely.
-For the Qusar State Protected Area no changes to the present condition are expected for
the future operation of the canal.
For the Yalama Forest, sizeable negative impacts are not likely to occur.
Positive impacts are that additional irrigation water would aid in the presently ongoing
re-plantation programme, about 120 ha per year being replanted in the zone. Until the
young plants reach sufficient depth to groundwater, they need to be maintained during
the dry summer season.
The situation of the Deveci lake and its hydraulic regime is likely to improve from
increased inflow from SAC in the future as reduced water losses in the SAC and better
irrigation management and practices will create an opportunity to also reduce of the
area's dependence on the local stream for irrigation. However, the hydrologic regime of
the Deveci lake should be considered in the monitoring programme.
2.3   WATER RESOURCES
2.3.1. General
The SAC and the MMMC projects both deal with problems of water management. In
case of the SAC it is to ensure water supply for irrigation and potable water, while the
MMMC deals with the drainage of agricultural lands. In both cases the natural water
resource are affected. This includes surface water and groundwater as well.
According to published figures about 1,36 Mio. hectares of agricultural area are under
irrigation in Azerbaijan (Shabanov A.I., 1991, Geological monitoring of Azerbaijan
meliorated areas; Commission of Water Resources, Moscow). Approximately 40 % of
this area is drained by a network consisting mostly of open collectors. Great efforts are
undertaken to improve both the irrigation systems and the drainage systems. The
presently studied SAC and MMMC project areas represent a prominent example for
these efforts which will also directly affect the existing hydrographic situation, as the
present hydrologic network of rivers, canals and collectors will be modified. The
modifications can be outlined as follows:
1. SAC: water distribution for irrigation

2. MMMC: a new collector will be built to separate the drainage systems of the left
bank and the right bank of the Kura river.
To observe the natural water resources, a nation wide hydrologic observation network
has been set up by the State Hydrometeorological Institute and by the State Comnmittee
for Geology between 1979 and 1992. These network comprise 16 372 groundwater
observation wells and 230 hydrometric gauges. Data from these services are used as
much as possible for the present assessment.
For the MMMC project area the Kura and Araz rivers were observed by the above
mentioned institute, that operates regular gauging stations on both rivers. In addition
geohydrological groundwater observations were carried out in the MMMC irrigation
zone by the geohydrological institute. The same institutes also carried out respective
observations for the SAC area.
The following Table 2.1 shows the distribution of observation gauges and their

2.3.2 MMMC - Monitoring Area
2.3.2.1 Climate
The MMMC monitoring area is located in the Mill plains between the Kura and Araz
rivers. The climatic station of Imishli is considered to represent the conditions of the
monitoring area. For this station most recent data of the last 10 years have been
provided by the Hydrometeorological Institute (see Annex A.7). According to its data
the climate in the MMMC area is characteristic for semi-steppe. The summer is hot and
dry, the winter is relatively warmn with low precipitation.
Snow can be observed rarely. The mean annual temperature is about 15 'C. The
observed absolute maximum temperature is 42 °C. The hottest months are July and
August, with average monthly temperatures of approximately 27 °C. During the winter
months average monthly temperatures drop down to 3.6 'C for January. However, the
absolute minimum was recorded as -26 'C. The number of frost free days is in the range
of 240 to 260 days per year.
During the last decade the average annual precipitation for the area is almost 290 mm,
with a range from 186 mm to 354 mm. The maximum daily precipitation was observed
at Imishli climatic station to be 90 mm. The average annual relative humidity is 66.5 %,
during the winter time it climbs up to almost 80 % in December, during the summer
time it drops down to 56 % in July. The average annual wind velocity is about
1.4 m/sec. The highest average monthly wind velocities were observed during June
(1.7 m/s). During the winter month it drops down to approximately 1 mls.
2.3.2.2 Surface Water Resources
The climatic conditions of this zone have to be considered as almost semi-arid as
detailed above. Intensive agricultural activity therefore crucially depends on irrigation
practices. The irrigated area covers about 160 000 ha, which are supplied by the upper
Karabakh irrigation Canal, which off-takes from the Araz river. A separated network
collects drainage and sewage water. Among these collectors are the so called K-2 and
K-3 collectors that discharge drainage water and sewage into the Ag gol lake. Water
discharging into the lake is highly mineralised (2-3 gr/l), it is also reported to carry
considerable concentrations of pesticides and nutrients.
The Ag gol lake has one single outlet on its northern shore. After crossing the Mill
Karabakh Collector by a siphon the Ag gol discharges into the Bozkobu swamp. From
here it continues as a collector to the Sarisu lake. The Sarisu lake is controlled by a weir.
At times of high water levels it spills into the Kura river which then receives seriously
mineralised water, that is also loaded with health affecting substances.

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector  ASSESSMENT
Regular observations on the inflow and outflow from the lakes have never been carried
out before. However, during the RIIDIA II Feasibility Study the inflows into the Ag gol
lake once have been measured to be approximately 8.5 m3/sec. (Dec., 1998). The
outflow from the Sarisu lake once was measured to be in the order of 15 m3/sec. (Feb.,
1999). These measurements should not be considered as more than an indication of the
discharges, because of the different observation times they can not be directly compared.
2.3.2.3 Groundwater Resources
The influence zone of the proposed MMMC is insufficiently drained. Consequently
irrigation water increases the groundwater level, which can be found from the analysis
of ground water observations. These observations show a strong correlation between
donations of irrigation water and rising of groundwater level.
Average annual precipitation is approximately 300 mm, most of it is considered to be
evaporated. The hydrologically and geo-hydrologically effective portion of rainfall is
therefore negligible. The lowest groundwater tables have been observed in the alluvial
zones of the Mill steppe. In these areas the ground water table is found in depths of 2.8-
3.5 m below soil surface. The following Table 2.2 shows for the period 1991/1998
MMMC areas for six different classes of groundwater tables. Form this it may be
interpreted, that areas of high groundwater tables (< Im) are increasing, mainly after
1997. This is considered as a direct effect of insufficient drainage.
In general the maximum ground water levels occur in April and June, while the
minimum levels are found in October and November after the end of the irrigation
season. The fluctuation of ground water level is about 1.0 - 2.4 m during the year. The
most significant fluctuation of the ground water level is observed in the wells located in
the direct vicinity of irrigated areas and near open water courses. Monthly groundwater
data are shown in Annex A.8, apart from monthly fluctuations and the annual pattem no
trends are obvious.

2.3.2.4 Potentialfuture Impacts
The flow regime of the Kura river and of the Araz river are considered not to be
significantly affected by the implementation of the MMMC project. From the water
resources point of view the main impacts of the MMMC project could arise from
changing the water balance of the Sarisu lake. As mentioned before, the water levels of
the lake crucially depend on the inflow of sufficient drainage water into Ag gol lake and
from there to Sarisu lake and of excess irrigation water to Sarisu Lake. It must be
assured, that the present hydrologic system is not modified in a way that endangers
future water supply to Sarisu lake, which is among the country's major ecological
reservations. It is noted that at this moment it is not known what the impact of the
MMMC will be on Lake Sarisu. The MMMC will have no impact on Ag Gol lake and
the inflow from the collector drains will continue as before. The MMMC will reduce
the direct drainage zone into Lake Sarisu. It is not known how much this direct inflow
now and with how much it will be reduced. It is also not known whether this reduced
inflow in the future exceeds the current outflow from Lake Sarisu into the Kura river.
In order to investigate this threat, it is deemed necessary to establish an adequate
network of hydrometric gauges that enable effective monitoring and assessment of the
water balance of the interconnected Ag gol and Sarisu lakes. Based on the monitoring
results, it may be required that water management regulations are worked out by the
project that assure sufficient water level and water quality of the lakes strictly taking
into consideration the monitoring results.
This may include improvements in the quality of inflows into Ag gol lake by using fresh
irrigation water from the upper Kharabakh canal during the winter time (October -
March). During the vegetation period the lake should be supplied by a mixture of water
from K-2 / K-3 collectors and from the upper Kharabakh canal. The Sarisu lake then
would also profit from the improved Ag gol lake. However, for the summer time,
additional inflow from the Kura river could be suggested. The situation of the Sarisu
lake could be improved directly by conveyance of more excess irrigation water through
canals P-1 and P-12-1. By these actions the hydrological balance and the ecological
functions of the lakes would be ensured, the water quality of the lakes would also be
improved significantly. As a consequence of this the water quality of the Kura river
would be improved, which is considered to have direct effects on the water supply of
Baku.

2.3.3.1 Climate
Climatologically the SAC monitoring area has to be defined as semi-continental, it
forms part of the semi-steppe zone. The climatic station of Khachmaz is considered to
represent the situation of the area. For the assessment the latest ten years of data records
have been applied (See annex A.7).
The average annual temperature is about 12.6 °C, with a small range of 11.4 to 13.5 OC.
-The absolute maximum temperature is observed to be about 420C, absolute minimum
temperature is -280C. The hottest month is July with average temperatures of about 24.6
°C. During the winter time temperatures fall to about 1.6 °C. Long-term average
precipitation is approximately 300 mm, the maximum daily precipitation was observed
tobe 100mm.
The average relative humidity is 78%. During winter time the average monthly can go
up to 86 %, in sunmmer time it falls to 65 %.
The mean annual wind velocity is about 2.3 m3/sec. During the hot time the average
monthly wind velocity is 2.4 m/s, in winter time is approximately 2.2 m/sec.
2.3.3.2 Surface Water Resources
The RIIDIA II Feasibility Study revises the hydrological design capacities for the
rehabilitation of the upper 50 km of the Samur Apsheron Canal (SAC) to cope with its
tasks. The entire canal is of crucial importance to the social and economic welfare of the
SAC region. It carries water from the Samur River in the north to Baku and further to
the south. The SAC is the major water conveyor of the region. It connects the dry SAC
project area with its vast irrigation schemes and the metropolitan area of Greater Baku
to the water resources of the Samur.
The RIIDIA II design capacities for the upper 50 km reach of the SAC take into
consideration additional flows that may be diverted in the future from seven local rivers
crossing the SAC on the named reach. These rivers are from north to south: Qusarchay,
Quruchay, Qudyalchay, Agchay, Qarachay, Chagachuqchay and the Velvelichay. All the
rivers follow the same hydrological pattem, which is characterised by peak flows during
the early summer months and by a crucially dryer period during the winter months,
reflecting just the mountainous origin of the rivers. Their higher catchment parts receive
a good portion of their annual precipitation during the winter months (40 %) in form of
snow, which is stored until the warmer temperatures of the. late spring cause snow smelt.
Only about 20 to 30 % of the runoff is caused directly by surface runoff, while the
remaining 40 % are considered as ground water recharged base flow which is of special
importance in the coastal area. Principally the snow-melting mechanism is to be
considered as a natural reservoir allowing for additional water supply during dry and hot
summer months, when the water demand is the highest in irrigation and other

and Figure 2.3.
The concerned river flows have been taken into account for the determination of the
design discharge of the first 50 km of the SAC. Possible effects on the environment,
especially in the river sections downstream of the SAC are not dealt with in this study as
river diversion is not included in the current SAC project. The proposed rehabilitation
under this project would not include any enlargements of abstraction or canal capacity.

The Deveci lake is the biggest water body in the SAC monitoring area. Its only
freshwater source is the Shabranchay. This river crosses the Samur Apsheron Canal
downstream of the 50 kmn rehabilitation reach and no abstractions from this river are
planned to feed the canal. In the past the lake has suffered strongly from near drying out
with the consequent difficulties of re-establishing the fish population, which is still not
overcome completely. However, the future water balance of the lake may be positively
affected by the project as the area's dependence on the local stream for irrigation will be
reduced.
2.3.3.3 Groundwater Resources
Available data (see Table 2.4) show, that the ground water table is raising in average by
about I m over the period 1950 until 1995. The rapid raise mainly began after 1980. The
raising of the groundwater table is expected to be a consequence of increased
application of irrigation water.

However, the latest available groundwater information (see Table 2.5), generated from 7
wells in the SAC area, shows that the groundwater table can be considered as stable
since 1991. This may correlate with the general economic situation and the reduction of
agricultural activities. Annex A.8 shows monthly groundwater data for the SAC area.
This demonstrate slightly monthly variations according to the annual pattern, but no
obvious trends.

2.3.3.4 Potential Future Impacts
After the rehabilitation of the SAC the irrigated agriculture is likely to be intensified in
the SAC area. Intensification of irrigated agriculture will increase the amount of water
that is donated to the fields - consequently the micro climatic conditions will change to
higher humidity. This however might moderately lower the air temperatures.
Consequently the land/sea temperature gradient may smoothen which in reverse could
lower wind velocities a little bit. However, these effects are not considered to have
significant influence on the climatic and micro climatic conditions in the SAC area.
In future a total of seven local rivers may be partly diverted to the SAC. The potential
river diversions would be located in an approximate distance of 20 to 30 kilometres
upstream their mouths into the Caspian Sea. Ecological flow requirements of these
rivers are shown in Table 2.6. Environmental impacts have not been assessed as river
diversion is not part of the envisaged project financed by IDA, not currently by any

which would combine technical, economic and environmental aspects of needed river
diversions for increased water supply for irrigation and to Baku.

The operation of the rehabilitated SAC will have no direct effects on the hydrological
regime of any of the crossed local rivers as no river diversions are planned for this
project phase. The Deveci lake is located approx. 25 km southeast of the lower end of
the SAC reach to be rehabilitated. It is likely that impacts on the lake will be positive, if
any. Positive effects may arise from reduced canal losses and increased irrigation
efficiency. Both would reduce water abstractions from local rivers allowing more river
flow reaching the lake. Anyhow, it is suggested to monitor the hydrological regime of
the lake by observing and analysing its inflows and water levels.
There are no indications that groundwater levels will be affected by the rehabilitation of
the canal.
2.4    SOIL DEGRADATION AND LAND USE
2.4.1 General
Agricultural crop yields are directly related to soil conditions, if soils degradate yield
decrease immediately - soil conservation therefore is an important task to maintain high
productivity.
The soil conditions of the MMMC and SAC monitoring areas are assessed on the basis
of data obtained from the Hydrogeological and Melioration Expedition of SAIC, and
Azgiprovodkhoz Institute. This baseline information includes data from the field studies
and laboratory analysis of 1997. This information is completed by soil surveys carried

out during the RIIDIA II Project (1998/1999) and during the present study (July 1999).
The before mentioned data were completed by Landsat Satellite information of Summer
1998.
The available data were processed and analysed according to standard procedures as
accepted in Azerbaijan. The MMMC monitoring area was assessed in view of the
drainage conditions, focussing on salinity and soil degradation, the SAC area was
assessed in view of irrigated agriculture.
2.4.2 The MMMC Monitoring Area
Approximately 27-34 % of the upper Mill-Karabakh plain is used for irrigated
agriculture. In the higher parts these plains are well drained. The monitoring area is
geologically formed by weak, fragmented zigzag plains. The area slopes down from
north-west to south-west with an average of 0.003 m/m. The soil types in this area are
various (see chapter 2.4.2.1).
Soil conditions in irrigated areas are characterised by their salinity, mechanical property,
ground water level, acidity, contents of nutrients, status of degradation and by the
quality of irrigation water. These aspects are considered for the assessment of the
present conditions in the MMMC monitoring area.
2.4.2.1 Assessment of present Soil Conditions
The MMMC monitoring area measures approximately 168 000 ha. Both, alkaline and
acidified soils are found in the area. Soil types of the Mill-Karabakh sector and their
predominant spatial spreading are shown in Table 2.7.

On the 26"' and 27'h of July, 1999 a field trip was carried out to take 12 soil samples (see
Figure 3.5 at the Chapter 3.6 on Soil Degradation and Land Use) in the MMMC
monitoring area. It should be noticed that the soil samples were collected during the
irrigation season. Therefore, it was not possible to assess the real situation on the
salinity and mechanical properties of the soil. So, results of the analysis obtained from
this field trip (see Annex A.9) has not been accepted to be reflecting the real situation.
However these results are used to assess the soil conditions together with results
obtained form the previous studies of RIIDIA II project. Meliorative conditions of the
soils in the monitoring area are various. The monitoring area is dominated by soils that
have chlorinated-sulfated type of salts or only the sulfated salts.
T=he soils around the new and KI collectors are highly to moderately salined. The
salinity of the soils varies between 1.21 to 2.31 % of dried residual substances. For these
type of soils special meliorative measures have to be taken into consideration. At the
remaining part of the MMMC monitoring area soils are composed by non-salined, less
salined or moderately salined type of soils. These areas could be used for agricultural
purposes without any special treatment or with simple measures. Soils in the MMMC
area differ from place to place conceming their alkalinity. Total amount of nitrates
varies from 3.1 to 19.3 % of total substances in soil.
Soil texture of the alluvial sediments consist mainly of silty and fine sandy loams and
medium clays. In the confluence of Araz and Kura river and zone of lakes, silty clays,
clays and heavy clays predominate.
In the zone near the mountains some gravels are included in lenses.
In Imishli left bank sector, areas requiring drainage amount to 15 300 ha, from a total of
39 118 ha, while in Agjabedi areas in need of rehabilitation amount to 31 000 ha from
56 257 ha. This does not include about 5 000 ha in the Araz left bank sector of Saatli.
[Al, 1999]
According to the USDA soil suitability classification, soils suitable for irrigation with
slight restrictions (II) are those with none or low salinity (< 0.25 g/lOOg soil). These
cover about 230 400 ha, equivalent to 40 %. Areas with severe restrictions (III ), with
salinity between 0,25 and 0,5 g/lOOg cover 115 200 ha or 20 %. The remaining 40 %
shows soils with more than 0,5g salt per lOOg of soil (very severe restrictions class IV

and worse) the consultant considers these areas not to be meliorable economically.
[CES, EIA of RIIDIA II Project Feasibility Study, 1999]
In the left bank Araz river sector of Imishli the soil salinity is distributed as follows:
Slightly saline     8 000 ha; 20.5 %  (0,25 - 0,50 g/100 soil) class III
Moderately saline   3 600 ha; 9.2 %  (0,50 - 1,00 g/lOOg soil) class IV
Highly saline      27 518 ha 70.3 % (>1,0       g/lOOg soil) class V - VI
In Agjabedi salinity distribution shows the following values:
Non saline                  25 257 ha, class II
slightly saline             11 000 ha, class III
Highly saline               20 000 ha class V - VI
Soil degradation occurs in the MMMC areas as:
a) Salinity/Alkalinity
Salinity affects about 60 % of the Mill-Karabakh zone, equivalent to about 345 600 ha.
Of these about 230 400 ha (40 %) have a salt content above 0.5 g/100 g soil, equivalent
to the FAO level of electric conductivity in the saturation extract EC of approximately
10 mmohs/cm. Areas with salt contents above this are considered by the Consultant as
economically not meliorable (for details of the direct project area affected, see EIA of
RIIDIA II Project)
b) Relief and Erosion
No evidence of water erosion can be found in the zone except riverbank erosion and
sagging of hydraulic structures. The wide open spaces are conducive to wind erosion.
and drying effect of the wind.
The total irrigated area in the Azerbaijan has almost doubled from 726 000 ha in 1940 to
1 450 000 ha in 1995. [Elimov E.K., Irrigation at its Impacts on Environment, Baku,
1996]. In the Mill-Karabakh Plain the increase was even higher.
With the extension of the irrigated areas the pressure on the drainage collectors
increased considerably. Mainly the K-1, K-2, K-3 and the Mill-Karabakh Collector, but
also the inter-farm collectors have exceeded their capacities, consequently considerable
area can not be drained adequately.
Maintenance of the collectors is one of the basic elements in soil conservation. The
observations form the field trip of July 99 are noted in the Annex A.9, however, it was
found that most of the collectors are in bad condition. Bank erosion was observed, many
collectors are blocked by vegetation (reeds) or by sediments. As a result the efficiency
of the collector system drops. Leaching out of salts from the soils is decreased. In some
cases, the soil salinity even increases due to the rise of the groundwater.
Annex A. 10 shows a comparison of soil salinity data of Imishli district for January 1997
and January 1998. According to be data the soils having good and sufficient meliorative

conditions decreased by 16.2 % and 7.5 % respectively, whereas the soils having
insufficient meliorative conditions increased by 35.4 %. If the soil salinity problem goes
on to increases that fast goes that fast suitable soils for agriculture may become rare in
the future.
If the drainage conditions in the MMMC monitoring area do not improve than benefits
from irrigation will be little in the future.
2.4.2.2 Assessment offuture Soil Degradation and Land-use related Project Impact
During the construction great amounts of soil (about 350 m3 per running meter) need to
be excavated and moved during the construction of the 31 km stretch of the new main
collector. As a normal procedure, excavated soil and subsoil will be deposited laterally
to form a dike and a compacted roadway for inspection and maintenance. No negative
impact is seen as the soils can be considered as uncontaminated, possessing a salinity
comparable to the environment from which they were extracted. As the topsoil usually
is saline and contains little humus, a separation from the rest of the excavation material
is not considered necessary or useful. Only in wet depressions with soils of high humus
contents this should be removed in the interest of embankment stability.
During the operation of the main collector and adjacent sub-collectors will accomplish
the primary purpose: the leaching of salts and soil improvement for irrigation purposes
for an estimated area of about 36 500 ha. Further areas will be improved in the upstream
sectors of the Mill-Karabakh collector once drainage has been rehabilitated and new
drainage sectors implemented.
New or reclaimed areas under agriculture will in the appreciable future be cultivated
with the help of fertilisers and agro-chemicals, once production and markets have been
re-established. Soils will accumulate these substances and transfer them via plants used
for consumption or fodder into the food chain. In addition leached substances will be
transmitted to the drainage water and harm aquatic organisms or may lead to
eutrophication.
2.4.3 The SAC Monitoring Area
The SAC monitoring area is characterised by extended future irrigation activities.
Therefore irrigation related soil and land use aspects are considered mainly. The
assessment of the present situation is based on soil surveys carried out during the
RIIIDIA II feasibility study. These data were completed by those gained from the soil
survey of July 99.

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector      ASSESSMENT
2.4.3.1 Assessment of present Soil Conditions
According to the Dokuchajev soil classification [FAO,1985,  Water  Quality  for
Agriculture, FAO Irrigation and Drainage paper 29 (revision 1), Food and Agricultural
Organization of the United nations, Rome] the soil types of the SAC area are closely
related to their physiographic position:
*  Upper reaches of the alluvial fans: Typical and carbonated grass-brown;
*  Intermediate parts of alluvial fans: dark and ordinary chestnut;
* Southern plain: Grass-grey, salinated and sandy;
*  Lower parts of alluvial fans and coastal plain: in dry parts washed and carbonated
grass forest, and in wet parts wet alluvial grass soils.
The soil texture is defined by hard clay to medium clays, the lighter soils (clay loams)
concentrating on the upper portions of the alluvial fans. In the vicinity of the principal
rivers shallow soils on gravel deposits prevail. On the coastal sand bar, soils are not
suitable for surface irrigation.
Drainage condition of the soil in the upper and middle part of the alluvial fans is
generally good. In the coastal plain areas of soils with deficient drainage is about 57 700
ha, equivalent to 64 %.
Soil salinity occurs on presently irrigated or abandoned soils at a moderate level in the
monitoring area. Total project area affected by salinity to such degrees as to make
leaching necessary is 24 503 ha, equivalent to 27%.
Soils of the foothills and coastal plains area can generally be considered to have good
productive capacity, but some problems due to heavy texture. This is equivalent to a
suitability rating of I to II according to the USDA Classification (about 46 000 ha, see
Table 2.9). Only in the areas requiring drainage, suitability can be considered III to TV.
Sandy soils of the coastal sandbar are rated VII, generally unsuitable for agriculture. A
special case might be made for grape or fig, but only under drip irrigation. Except for
this area no restrictions to selection of crops are given except the climatic one, in effect
a semi-arid climate wkith short frost spells in winter. Recommended crops are wheat,
fodder crops, orchards, vegetables and other crop requiring intensive inputs.
According to the information obtained from Azgiprovodkhoz Institute, the soils of the
Qusar and Quba districts are more unfavourable than the other soils of the monitoring
area. Some part of the soils of Khachmaz district is salined. Erosion has been recorded
in the higly sloped parts of the Qusar and Quba districts. Approximately 105,150 ha of
the soils of the Quba-Khachmaz area is exposed to moderate and / or high erosion. (See

Agriculture usually applies agro-chemicals in the monitoring area. This affects the soil
conditions and groundwater in the area. The concentration of the chlorinated pesticides
in the soils of the vineyards of the Quba district varied from 1 to 10 mgeq/kg of soil
during the FSU time. [Galiulin R.V. et all, 1982, Chlorinated Pesticides and Heavy
Metals in the Soils of Azerbaijan, Pushino]
The amount of the fertilisers used in different districts of the SAC monitoring area is

many places. These deficiencies have caused rising of groundwater levels, soil
salinisation and extension of swampy areas.
The soils in the irrigated areas of the SAC region are saline. The central area of the SAC
which are not used for agricultural purposes are also salined soils. The soils located at
the 50 km of the monitored SAC reach are good in quality. Unfortunately, the
meliorative quality of the soils of the Khachmaz district that are located near to the
Velvelichay decreased. (See Table 2.1 1) This is mainly related to the non-functioning of
.the collectors in that area.
The field trip into the SAC monitoring area is carried out between the dates 29th and 30th
of July. (see Figure 3.6: Location of Soil Sampling Points in the SAC monitoring Area).
The samples were collected from 15 points. For the results of the analysis obtained from
this field trip see Annex A. 13. The soil salinity varies from 0.08 to 0.18 % of the dried
residual substances. These soils in the SAC area are neutral or slightly alkaline. The
total amount of nitrates in the 2nd and 4h sampling points reaches to 5.1 and 10.1 % of
total substances in soil, respectively. The soils can be used for agricultural purposes.

2.4.3.2 Assessment offuture Soil Degradation and Land-use related Project Impact
Based on the results of a comprehensive sedimentation plan to be carried out during the
early stages of implementation During the construction considerable volumes of
sediments will need to be taken out of these sedimentation basins. The two
sedimentation basins are located at 6 km and at 12 km downstream of the Samur weir. It
is estimated, that sediments settled in the two sedimentation basins have a total volume
of approx. 7 mio. m3. These will either be spilled into adjacent rivers with
corresponding temporary effects or will need to be excavated and transported to one or
more adequate landfill site(s) at an acceptable transport distance. The site(s) and the
excavation/transport methods should be defined and agreed upon before the start of the
rehabilitation works. The sediments are uncontaminated, originating from the Samur
river, and no special precautions need to be taken.
The damaged old canal lining and old hydraulic infrastructure made of concrete and
steel need also to be deposited in an adequate space. As these are essentially
uncontaminated materials, no special precautions need to be taken: e.g. abandoned

quarries or rocky surfaces could be useful spots. Altematively the material may be
recycled as road-fill material or for other construction purposes.
Construction could possibly trigger soil erosion due to destruction of vegetation cover,
compaction by heavy traffic and concentration of surface flow.
During operation of the project, additional irrigation in the future will affect soil
resources with potential contamination hazard by agrochemicals. This could affect the
.quality of agricultural products, of drain-water entering into sensitive areas.
During the future operation of the rehabilitated Samur Apsheron Canal its desiltation
basins will need to be regularly cleared. The sediments of an annual volume of approx.
600 000 m3 need to be transported and stored at an adequate landfill. This site should be
located at an acceptable transport distance. The sediments are originating from the
Samur river, they are uncontaminated, and no special precautions need to be taken in
this respect. The landfill site and the excavation/transport methods should be defined
and agreed upon before the start of the canal operation. This assessment would be part
of the sedimentation study.
No significant erosion hazard is expected for agriculture, as terrain slopes at the level of
the canal are already of reduced inclination.
2.5   WATER QUALITY
2.5.1 General
In general, irrigated agriculture affects the quality of water. The return (drainage) flow
may carry salts and may be contaminated with agro-chemicals and nutrients. By this
irrigation and drainage may have effects on the ecology of water resources due to
decrease in amount and / or in quality.
The MMMC and SAC monitoring areas include both drinking water resources and also
environmentally important water resources.
Water quality of rivers is observed by the State Hydrometorological Institute. In the past
the Azgiprovodkhoz Institute also observed the quality of water resources used for
irrigation purposes. The base line information in the water quality assessment is
considered to be as recent as possible. Therefore the assessment of the present
conditions of the water resources in the MMMC and SAC monitoring areas is based on
data obtained from the previous RIIDIA II EIA and from the field trip of present study.
Annexes A.2, A.3, A.4, A.5 and A.6 are generalised water quality standards, guidelines
and recommendations for irrigation, drinking and fresh water fisheries. In addition
Annex A.24 gives the national water quality standards for drinking water, fisheries, etc..
These standards have been taken into account for evaluation.

2.5.2 MMMC Monitoring Area
2.5.2.1 Present Water Quality Situation
The inadequate water quality in the MMMC area is caused by both the point and
diffused type of pollution sources. Main industries are concentrated in the population
centres Saatli and Imishli. Household discharges and industrial wastewater either are
emitted into the Araz river or enter into collectors. The main contamination originates
from leaching of salts out of irrigation areas. Further pollution comes from pesticides
and nutrients from fertilisers. The harmful substances are leached by percolating
drainage water and enter into collectors, lakes and rivers. Present changes in agriculture
has brought the use of agrochemical down to zero, but the expected revival of
agricultural markets will bring increasing use of fertilisers, herbicides, fungicides and
pesticides. The quality of Kura water from the point of view of salinity, nutrients and
heavy metals can still be seen as satisfactory. The July 99 field trips carried out in the
MMMC monitoring areas show that Kura and Araz rivers water are suitable for drinking
and irrigation purposes. (See Annex A.25 and Table 2.12)
At present drainage water discharged into the lakes carries pros and contras. On the one
hand they supply the lakes with water, but this water carries leached out ions (salts) and
at least in the former times residues of fertilisers and plant protection chemicals to the
detriment of the precious flora and fauna. Evidence of excessive eutrophication was
reported in former times.

A.25) The formerly reported concentration of ammonium and phosphorus were 0.9 and
0.7 mg/I, respectively. The consultants owAn sampling in February '99 and in July ;99
resulted in values showing a marked decrease: 0.005 and 0.007 mg/l representing an
improvement of the lake water quality. Unfavourable oxygen conditions for fish existed
formerly: from 2.3 to 6.9 mg /1 02. Today, deficit of the oxygen still has been observed
during warmer months. [Mansurov A, Salmanov M, 1996, Ecology of Kura River and it's
Basin, Baku, Azerbaijan Republic]
.Sarisu
Fed by the water from Ag Gol and water emanating from extensive swampy areas, the
lake has almost double salinity of Ag Gol, due to the discharge of saline drainage water
(Annex A.25) from the Imishli irrigation sectors into it. Drainage waters from K and KI
systems are presently discharged into the Sarisu Lake. Additionally irrigation excess
water from P-1 and P-12-1 is reported to flow into the lake. Furthermore evaporation
from the lake surface and concentration of salts are additional factors.
2.5.2.2 Potential future Impact on Water Quality
In the MMMC project area the construction activities on the missing link of the Mill-
Mugan canal will involve great amount of excavation activities. Construction is done in
such a way that groundwater is allowed to flow through the completed section
downstream by gravity. Should pumping of groundwater become necessary for the
construction of hydraulic or other structures the highly mineralised water should be
discharged safely to the downstream section. In no case should any mineralised
groundwater be allowed to enter some freshwater rivers or ecologically sensitive lakes.
The new main collector and the adjacent rehabilitated sub-collectors will effect the
primary purpose: the intended groundwater lowering and at the same time the leaching
of salts. Drainage water at present entering Sarisu lake and Kura river will be
intercepted and carried away. Thus lake water will be improved considerably as input of
salts will be reduced as well as contamination by fertilisers and agrochemicals. The
Kura river will be protected from unwanted intake of drainage water carrying salts and
contaminants, improving the water quality for the freshwater off-take for Baku water
supply, and last but not least improving conditions for the fish population in the Kura
river, the fish production facilities at Neftchala and the sturgeon hatcheries, once re-
established.
In the future, drainage improvements can be expected for the upper sectors of the Mill-
Karabakh Collector, once rehabilitation and construction of new drainage schemes have
been accomplished.
Intercepting of the drainage flow on the other hand will deprive the Sarisu lake of a
certain proportion of inflow needed to maintain an ecologically sustainable water level.
Therefore this lake may have water quality problems due to increase in concentrations

caused by the less inflow. However, at this point cross reference is made to the Water
Resources chapter 2.3 where proposals are made how to ensure the water balance of the
lakes.
Once the drainage conditions improve, the use of agrochemical may also increase due to
intensified agricultural activities. This may lead to the contamination of groundwater
and/or Ag gol and Sarisu lakes by agrochemicals. However without the new MMMC
this problem would be even more severe.
2.5.3 SAC Monitoring Area
The methodology of water quality assessment of the SAC monitoring area is based on
the same standards and guidelines mentioned for the MMMC monitoring area. The SAC
water is used for irrigation and drinking water purposes.
2.5.3.1 Present Water Quality Situation
The sources of water contamination in the project area are mainly from the agricultural
areas and the effluent from the large population centres. During the times of the former
Soviet Union large amounts of fertilisers, pesticides and herbicides have been used in
intensive agriculture, especially in the orchard and grape production which is of great
significance for the region. Substances used have been recognised today as being
harmful to the environment and consequently are banned, but residual effects such as
chlorinated hydrocarbons are still to be registered. Fertilisers, especially nitrogenous
have been washed out by drainage water and have contributed to the eutrophication of
watercourses. With the demise of the former Soviet Union and the subsequent re-
structurisation, the use of agrochemical has been drastically reduced on economic
grounds, and this has contributed to the reduction of environmental contamination. Yet,
in the future, with the expected economic upturn it can be envisaged that the use of
fertilisers and fungicides, herbicides and pesticides will again increase, albeit not to the
same levels as during the former Soviet Union period. A number of population centres
are situated next to the principal rivers. These are Qusar on the Qusarchay, Quba and
Khachmaz on the Qudyalchay. Their population and industries have contributed to the
environmental degradation of the rivers. Due to the downturn of the industrial
production, river contamination with industrial discharge containing heavy metals and
hydrocarbons have decreased, but deteriorating conditions in the water supply and
sanitation have contributed to an ever increasing load of sanitary hazards. This is
reflected by the prevalence of intestinal and water bome diseases in the region (see
section 0). Yet the contamnination data on rivers, other than hygienic criteria, generally
attest the rivers a good water quality (see Annex A 25). The following Table 2.13
sunumarises the results from water quality analyses carried out recently in February 1999
and July 1999.

The Deveci lake receives its inflow mainly from the Shabranchay river, however, as
considerable flows are diverted from the river to irrigation schemes the lake is loosing
its catchment. In 1998 the lake suffered near complete drying out with a consequent
disaster on the fish population and impact on the wildlife feeding on them. Drainwater
of agricultural areas in the irrigated watershed above the lake, including the heavily
contaminated waters of the Devecichay at present are intercepted by a collector drain, so
that they do not enter the lake, but are led to the sea. Water quality in February was very
saline EC 7.87 (about 5 g/l). Eutrophic conditions of the lake was observed by the
consultant within the Deveci lagune, which manifested itself by abundant green algae and
dense, thick reed bands (- 200 to 400 m at both sides of the lake).
Due to water scarcity, repeated attempts have been made to divert collector water to the
lake, but -perhaps a mixed blessing- they have failed due to lack of technical means.
2.5.3.2 Potentialfuture Impact on Water Quality
During the re-construction of SAC all water resources at which rehabilitation needs to
be done will be affected. This includes the Samur river and all transversal rivers to the
canal that are connected. Main cause will be the temporary diversion of water, stirring
up and spilling of sediment and construction debris, making conditions for aquatic flora
and fauna temporarily difficult.
During the 2-year construction period SAC water needs to be diverted to the Kharnakh
Canal in order not to disrupt a continuous water supply to Baku and to the connected
irrigation schemes. This may cause section-wise temporary cut-off of irrigation water
for the immediate command area between Samur-Apsheron Canal and Kharnakh Canal,

with consequent loss of production  and socio-economic benefits.   However,
construction during the irrigation season will as much as possible on activities that
would not obstruct the water flow to these irrigation schemes.
No additional water will be diverted from the Samur river, therefore the operation of the
SAC will not change the Samur river flow regime. That means there will be no
detriment in the water quality of Samur river.
.Additional irrigation which may be expected with the recuperation of the economy in
the future may affect groundwater resources with potential contamination hazard by
agrochemicals. This could affect the groundwater quality extracted for Baku potable
water in the well galleries installed near the railway line in the Khachmaz region.
However, as explained, these threats are primarily related to the emerging economy and
not to the rehabilitation of the SAC.
Water that is harvested from two crossing rivers to feed the SAC may form a source of
water pollution in the future. Here serious water quality sampling may become
necessary in the future at the respective diversion works. Respective monitoring
requirements, however, are at this point in time not part of the present canal
rehabilitation project.
So far the water quality of the SAC is considered as excellent - the proposed
infrastructural measures will not change the present water quality. However, with the
recovery of the economy threats may come up that need to be handled by political care
and with full responsibility to ecology and water quality.
Water quality of the Deveci lake at present is poor. It may be changed to the positive in
the future as reduced canal losses and increased irrigation efficiencies may reduce the
farmers' dependence on Shabranchay flow. Under such conditions the lake could
receive more freshwater, clearly improving its water quality and its hydrological regime.
2.6    HEALTH SITUATION
2.6.1 General
An increase of water-borne or water-related diseases (see Annex A.1) is commonly
associated with the introduction or extension of irrigation. The diseases most often
linked with irrigation are schistomsomiasis, malaria and onchocerciasis, whose vectors
proliferate in the irrigation water. However, it is expected that the probability of the
occurrence of these diseases is decreased by means of drainage measures. Sometimes
the reuse of drainage water, which is usually mixed with wastewater, for irrigation has
the potential of transmitting conmnunicable diseases (mainly helminthic, and to a lesser
extent bacterial and viral).

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area

Positive effects of irrigated agriculture from the point of health might be food security
and an increase in the purchasing power for drugs and health services.
The Republican Centre for Hygiene and Epidemiology is responsible for monitoring of
the health situation in Azerbaijan. Their laboratory equipment and technical staff is
considered suitable by the health expert to cope with the related tasks.
In general, irrigation and drainage have different effects on the health situation in the
.respective project areas. Unfortunately, as it will be discussed below, the present health
conditions have to be considered as not satisfying for the MMMC and the SAC project
areas.
Coliform organisms have long been recognised as a suitable microbial indicator of
drinking water quality, largely because they are easy to detect and enumerate in water.
WHO guideline states that all water intended for drinking purpose should not contain
any Escherichia Coli in any 100 ml sample.
2.6.2 MMMC - Monitoring Area
2.6.2.1 Present Healtlh Conditions
The MMMC area is governed by agricultural land use. In general the agricultural areas
are under irrigation, however, their present drainage conditions are considered as poor.
The non sufficient drainage capacities may form a threat to human health in the MMMC
area. Drainage water is often mixed with domestic effluent, further downstream it is
often reused e.g. for drinking water supply. The Kura and the Araz rivers form an
important resource for the water supply of Baku. These rivers may be affected by the
sanitary conditions in MMMC area, consequently they are to be considered as a threat to
the water supply of Baku. The information on diseases that occurred in the MMMC area
is mainly obtained from the Republican Centre for Hygiene and Epidemiology. In
addition field trips carried out by the Consultant gave information on contamination
sources. The findings from the previous RIIDIA II environmental impact assessment
study were considered.
The summertime amount of coliform bacteria increased in Sabirabad river water from
10 000 per ml in 1974 to 24 000 per ml in 1994. The river water is used for irrigation
purposes as well as for drinking water supply. The generally very direct and obvious
effects unfortunately can not be proven by means of district related statistical data,
however, the nation wide health statistics show a rise in nation-wide mortality between
1991 and 1994 by intestinal diseases from 27 to 31 per 100 000 capita and from 21 to 29
for infectious diseases.
During the first half of 1999 1, 8 and 67 cases of salmonella, viral hepatitis and malaria
have been observed in the Imishli district. At the first half of 1998 observed Malaria

cases were 377 and viral hepatitis cases were 24. This demonstrates the variability of
number of cases during the years. This improvement is reached by the education of the
people on health aspects and contamination. The status of further water-borne and
water-related diseases is shown in Table 2.14 for different districts of the MMMC area.
The percentage of people infected by the diseases has risen by 5.7% in 1998. Table 2.14
shows that water-washed diseases, Category II (See Annex A. 1) are widespread in
MMMC region. To protect people against that type of category II diseases the quality of
water, water accessibility and hygiene conditions need to be improved.
2.6.2.2 Potentialfuture Impacts on Healthi
Deteriorating sanitary facilities and population increase have led to increased amounts
of sanitary wastewater to be released into the rivers, canals and collectors.

The future impacts of the proposed infrastructural measures are assumed to be as
follows:
During the construction phase: construction activities will create temporary noises,
nuisances and road traffic emissions for any population in the vicinity of the
construction sites. Fortunately the area is very sparsely populated, with the exception
of the eastem end of the main collector, where the population engages in intensive
irrigation by river water from Araz.

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector ASSESSMENT
* The operation of Mill Mugan collector will improve drainage conditions on the right
hand side of the Kura river. Due to this improved drainage, better conditions for
health conditions will be created.
* The Kura river will be protected against unwanted inflow of drainage water carrying
salts and contaminants, improving the water quality for the freshwater off-take for
Baku water supply. So, the improved quality of potable water will help to avoid
health hazards, especially intestinal diseases of the urban population of Baku.
From the above it can be stated that the construction of the MMMC will not harm public
health in the project area, neither during construction nor during operation. In contrary,
it is likely that the proposed infrastructural measures will improve the sanitary
conditions, as a consequence the number of water-related health cases is considered to
decrease after project implementation.
2.6.3 SAC Monitoring Area
In the SAC project area it is planned to increase the agricultural production by means of
rehabilitation of the Samur Apsheron Canal. In addition this water resource is used as
drinking water supply of Baku. Any potential contamination of this water resource
might create health associated problems in the direct project area and in Baku. The
following chapters will assess available information concerning the actual health
situation and as it might be after project implementation.
For the SAC area the Consultant applied the same methodology as for the MMMC area.
Therefore reference is made to the respective chapter of the MMMC assessment.
2.6.3.1 Present Health Conditions
During the period of 1997/1998, 68 cases of viral hepatitis were observed in the
Khachmaz district. In 1997, 33 cases of Malaria have been recorded, in 1998 Malaria
was found in 49 cases in this district. Percentage of population having diseases has
reached to 3.8 in 1998. For other water-bome and water-related diseases and their
spreading across the SAC area reference is made to the below Table 2.15.

It shows, that water-washed diseases, Category II (See Annex A. 1) are widespread in the
SAC area, especially asceriasis. The improvement of water quality and of water
accessibility have to go hand in hand with better hygienic conditions to reduce the
number of cases.
2. 6.3.2 Potentialfuture Impacts on Healthl
Construction activities will create temporary noises, nuisances and road traffic
emissions for the population in the vicinity of the construction sites.
The operation of the rehabilitated canal will assure and improve flow for irrigation
demands and for the water supply of Baku. The losses will be reduced considerably and
more efficiency achieved in irrigation. Improvements in agricultural production will
generate correspondingly more income, and improved quality of potable water will help
avoid health hazards, especially intestinal and contagious diseases for all population
involved, including the urban population of Baku.
Some negative effects may be expected, when additional irrigation is implemented, the
microclimate turning generally more humid. Under deficient management waterlogging
may increase vector breeding grounds for the transmission of diseases like malaria. But
expansion of irrigated area is not intended under this project.
To combat health hazards from the increase in open water courses, environmentally
non-persistent and selective insecticides should be applied to reduce the multiplication
of aquatic larvae of disease vectors (malaria). As a management practice stagnant pools
of water should be avoided wherever possible.

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector  ASSESSMENT
2.7   SocIo-ECONOMIc ASPECTS
2.7.1 General
The SAC and the MMMC projects are understood to increase the agricultural
production and the living conditions. Taking this into account socio-economic aspects
gain major importance for the assessment of the present situation of the environment to
which man is an important contributor.
This socio-economic assessment is carried to elaborate the status quo or the present
situation in the two monitoring areas. It applies baseline information that is obtained
from the Committee for State Statistics of Azerbaijan Republic (CSSAR) and Imishli
and Khachmaz district offices of CSSAR, State Land Use Committee, State Irrigation
Committee and Ministry of Agriculture.
In general the most important key indicator for the socio-economic assessment is the
income situation, related to districts and different sectors. Unfortunately the Consultant
could not obtain these information from the relevant authorities. Anyhow, to reflect the
recent situation the Consultant briefly likes to refer to general income figures for
Azerbaijan. In 1998 the average monthly income per person is $US34.6, while the
expenditures per person are $US 34.0. The value of the total agricultural production is
$US 616 million in the plant-growing sector and $US428 million in the cattle-breeding
sector [CSSAR,1998].
To asses the socio-economic aspects it is necessary to find out which areas will be
effected from the project. To get the most accurate impression for the present situation
and for the future monitoring certain areas have been selected to serve as so called
indicator areas. The following assessment uses this approach.
2.7.2 Present Socio-Economic Situation in MMMC Monitoring Area
The MMMC monitoring area partly covers Agjabedi, Beylagan, Imishli, Saatli,
Sabirabad administrative districts. The delineation of the monitoring area is described in
chapter 2.1.1 and shown in Figure 2.1. From the agricultural point of view the MMMC
area may be characterised by the production of cotton and cattle. However, it is also one
of the major melon growing areas of the country. From a field trip carried out in July
1999 it could be seen, that the agricultural situation at present is under stress, which
reflects in obviously abandoned areas.
The present situation is assessed on the basis of information collected from the
organisations mentioned above. It is shown in the annexes as:
* Present population and increases in the rural and urban population of both of the
project areas at Annex A.14;
*  Agricultural land use at both ofthe monitoring areas at Annex A.15;

* The cropping pattern and crop yield of both of the monitoring areas at Annex A.16;
* Orchards and vineyards with produced amounts of fruits at both of the project areas
at Annex A.17; and
* Domestic animals of the both of the monitoring areas at Annex A. 18.
The data was collected for districts. The most representative district for the MMMC
monitoring is Imishli which covers almost 77 % of the entire monitoring area (see Table
2.16 and Figure 2.4).

the mountainside. Near the big rivers small but intensive agriculture and horticulture is
installed directly fed by river water pumps. Towards the salined and deficiently drained
area in the interfluvial depressions and near the swamps and lakes agriculture gradually
is replaced by a poor cattle and sheep pasture on salinity resistant grasses and herbs.
Main cultivated crops are cotton, fodder (alfalfa), and grains (mainly wheat). In the
Imishli district, typical for the project area, the cropping pattem consists of about 45%
cotton, 21 % Alfalfa, 21% Wheat, 5% silage maize and the balance in other forage crops
-and perennial cultures and 8 % for other agricultural plants. In other areas some
sugarbeets were produced for delivery to Iran, but this has now been discontinued.
[CES, 1999, EIA of the RIIDIA II Project]
Horticulture and fruticulture is practised on a small scale privately, where adequate
water and soil resources exist, mainly next to villages and on well drained soils on the
rivers.
The cotton is meanwhile delivered to five cotton ginneries installed by the Turkish firm
Paksu, but still production has not reached the level of former Soviet times, where a
ready market existed.
The land reform, allocating 0,75 ha per person, has led to a breakdown of the former
Kolkhozes and Sovkhozes without an equivalent formation of water user associations,
so that an effective irrigation management is still pending.
The monitoring area touches five districts with a total population of 493 thousand.
About 378.8 thousand people are considered as rural population, including the rural
population of the Imishli district which is 65.3 thousand people (Annex A.14). The
population figures for the MMMC monitoring area can not be defined from the present
data material. However, as the Imishli district form about 77 % of the monitoring area
its figures may be taken as an indicator for its population. The density of the present
population is calculated and given at the Annex A. 19. Imishli district has the lowest
population density with 1.54 ha/person.
Livestock per person is calculated and tabulated in the Annex A.20. The highest number
is 0.87 for the Agjabadi district, whereas the lowest is 0.46 for Beylagan district.
Usually all the districts have the same ratio of cattle per person, however Agjabadi
district has a big difference in the ratio if small livestock (sheep, goats) is considered.
On inter-farm level management problems come together with poor conditions of
irrigation and drainage infrastructure. This finally led to:
* Increased salinisation because of the conditions of the collectors as explained in the
chapter (2.4)
* Intensification of the salinisation process because of the inadequate irrigation
practices;
* Lack of financial means for the maintenance of the irrigation (Table 2.17) and of the
collector system

The irrigation water charges change from one district to another. The highest charge is
applied in Agjabadi district that is 0.87 US cents/100 m3, while the highest amount of
water is consumed in Sabirabad district. The indicating Imishli districts is found at the
lower end of the price scale with water charges of 0.13 US centllOO m3. The total
revenue obtained from the five districts was approximately 7 700US$ (I $US = 4 300
Manats), for Imishli this is about 425 $US.
The information about the employment and unemployment have been obtained directly
from the district offices of CSSAR and from its head office. For Imishli as the indicator
district, the following information has been given by the district offices. The employable
population of Imishli counts 54 500, the actual number of the working people is 38 500,
the actual number of the unemployed people is 16 000 which is 33% of the employable
people. These figures differ from the information given by the head office of CSSAR by

The population of the 4 districts is 379.1 thousands thereof 269.2 thousand are
considered as rural population, including the rural population of Khachmaz district
which is 87.5 thousand (Annex A.14). The population of the SAC monitoring area
should be represented more or less by that of the Khachmaz district.
Almost at all of the districts of the SAC Monitoring area the lands are mainly used as
vineyards or orchards. In irrigated orchards, mainly apples, pomegranates, plums
cherries, blackberries, vineyards, walnuts, chestnuts, hazelnuts etc. are cultivated.
In Khachmaz the ratio of the cattle per person is 0.54 and the ratio of small livestock per

The coastal plain is an important transport corridor between Baku and the states of the
CIS to the north. They comprise a double tracked railway line and a main highway
running alongside, leading to Dagestan. The most important population and
administrative district centres touched by this line are Deveci, Khachmaz and Khudat.
Present transit road traffic to Russia takes the main road branching off north of Deveci,
approximately following the line of the Samur Apsheron Canal and crosses the border
on the dam diverting the Samur water to Azerbaijan and Dagestan. Main road
communication to the important district capitals Quba and Qusar situated at
approximately 600 m elevation branch off to the west. Into the upper reaches of the
Caucasus watershed only small roads of increasingly lower standard with only local
significance follow up the river valleys. The combination of good soils, a more humid
climate and a good supply of irrigation water contribute to an intensive agriculture:
Irrigated agriculture comprises cereals, mainly wheat, and fodder, mainly alfalfa.
Intensive irrigated horticulture produces tomatoes, potatoes, onions, lettuce, cabbage,
peppers, egg-plants, carrots, etc.
The population density in the monitoring area is calculated for different land use
practices which are 1.41 ha/person agricultural lands, 0.41 ha/person sown area, 0.12

2.7.4 Potential Impacts on future Socio-economic Situation in both Monitoring
Areas
Main purpose of the SAC rehabilitation is to assure and improve flow for irrigation and
the potable water supply. in quantity and quality to the city of Baku. The water losses
will be reduced and more efficiency achieved in irrigation. Improvements in agricultural
production will generate correspondingly more income, and improved quality of potable
water will help avoid health hazards, especially intestinal and contagious diseases for all
population involved, including the urban population of Baku. The total farm area for
which improvement is foreseen amounts to 63 900 ha. Yearly income for farm-sizes
between 2.5 and 3 ha will rise by $US 000, benefiting about 20 000 families. For farm-
sizes of 25 to 30 ha, increase in income reaches $US 15 000, benefiting about 200
farms. [CES, 1999, EIA of the RIIDIA II Project].
Agricultural areas in the zone situated between the SAC and the Khanarkh Canal
comprising about 20 350 ha may suffer occasionally from irrigation water cut-off during
a rehabilitation period of about two years. Although this will only affect short canal
sectors and appurtenant outlets at a time, loss of agricultural income may occur, so far
not economically assessed. [CES,1999, EIA of RIIDIA II Project]
Numerous oil pipelines, defunct or active, cross the Samur Apsheron canal in the form
of pipe bridges. Special precautions need to be taken at the identified spots during

rehabilitation in order not to damage the oil pipeline and cause accidental spills and
economic losses.
The proposed canal rehabilitation will reduce water losses and improve water
availability with potential consequences on agricultural production. This may reflect on
irrigation techniques and may reduce exploitation and contamination of natural water
resources. For the Deveci lake this development can only be considered as positive.
.The MMMC area will profit from the proposed infrastructural measures by optimisation
of the agricultural production environment. It is assumed that agricultural output will
increase and that incomes will follow correspondingly. Additional benefits may be
expected from the side aspect of water quality improvement. This may reduce health
expenditures in the monitoring area and it may also reduce water treatment costs in
Baku.

3. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND
MONITORING PROGRAMME
3.1   GENERAL
Within the framework of the present environmental assessment and monitoring project,
numerous institutes and governmental organisations have been contacted to obtain the
available baseline information. Mainly the informnation is obtained from the
Hydrogeological Institute of SAIC, State Hydrometeorological Institute, Geological
Commission, Ministry of Health, etc.
The Consultant suggests to compile the monitoring information in a digital data base,
supplemented by a geographic information system (see chapter 4; Proposal of Geo-
graphic Information System (GIS) for RIIDIA Environmental Monitoring System
(REMS)), which can integrate geographic and attribute information for respective
analyses.
Monitoring is an activity which needs to be repeated periodically. The monitoring cycle
will start by the initial basic collection or observations of the defined parameters, which
signifies the compilation of existing information and the execution of supplementary
observation campaigns to obtain essential but so far missing data. The result will be
defined as the status quo.
Type, intricacy and quantity of data required defines the time between the repetition of
the monitoring cycle. In the context of the actual RIIDIA II irrigation and drainage
projects the repetition intervals are suggested by the Consultant to be between one and
six years.
In the future, after the first repetition of monitoring activities, an analysis of recorded
changes to the status quo can be made on developments analysed, but confirmation of
reliable tendencies and statistical correlation of parameters in the condition of the
environment will need at least several repetition cycles. It is therefore suggested to carry
out a first monitoring campaign early on during project implementation, a second should
be carried out mid-way through and a third after the implementation. The entire
monitoring period should not exceed ten years for the SAC and the MMMC project
area.
In parallel to the collection of basic information the institutional infrastructure for the
monitoring activities need to be developed. Consequently the implementation of an
environmental monitoring programme is suggested.

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector  MONITORING
The obtained environmental information will be used to trigger the necessary remedial,
compensation or avoidance action with the responsible executing authorities. In this
context the required co-operation of SAIC and ASCE is to be mentioned. Besides this,
the organisational arrangements should be established also between SAIC and other
relevant governmental organisations and institutes that can deliver relevant information.
To reach consensus on all these matters, SAIC conducted a workshop, held on 4 August,
1999 in Baku, during which the involved authorities and relevant governmental
*organisations and institutes have been informed about the proposed monitoring
programme. Major findings and issues of the programme have been discussed, e.g.
delineation of project areas, key parameters, monitoring cycles, executing agency. The
results from these discussions have been taken into consideration for the set-up of the
monitoring programme. The protocol of the workshop is given in Aniex C.
The proposed environmental monitoring programme includes key parameters and their
observation requirements, monitoring schedules, budget requirements for set-up and
operation and the institutional responsibility.
3.2.1. Potential Environmental Impacts
The proposed project would finance the rehabilitation of deteriorated irrigation
infrastructure and the completion of a collector drain. No new irrigation canals or
structures that would allow increase in the delivery capacity of water are envisaged. The
proposed project does not include any investments in dams or involve resettlement. It
has been classified as Category "B" for the purpose of OP 4.01 Environmental
Assessment.
Potential positive environmental impacts from the implementation of the project would
be: (i) in the SAC area reduction of water losses through improved infrastructure and
improved operation and maintenance (O&M); and (ii) in the MMCD area reduced risk
of soil salinization, waterlogging and standing water from improved drainage.
Potential negative impacts of the project would be: (i) a reduction in water inflow into
Lake Sarisu and subsequent reduction in water surface and depth; (ii) increased
agrochemical pollution and surface water contamination, resulting from increased use of
pesticides and fertilizers, along with improved availability of irrigation water; (iii)
indiscriminate dumping of excavated sediment deposits and other materials from the

canals, drains and structures during construction and maintenance; and (iv)
environmental damage caused by contractors during construction activities.
3.2.2    Mitigation Measures
The key mitigation measures recommended under this Environment Management Plan
(EMP) are:
From the previous Chapter it is clear that there will be a reduction in drainage water
flow to Lake Sarisu. Because of lack of inflow-outflow data of the Lake it is as yet
unclear whether this reduced water supply will negatively affect the lake's water level
and area. A comprehensive monitoring plan has been designed and costed (see next
Section). Based on the results of the monitoring, Lake Sarisu may have to be connected
to a new water source. A number of options have been considered: (i) increase the
water supply to Ag-Gol lake through a connection with the Mill-Karabakh Main
Irrigation Canal; or (ii) a connection with the Kura river. A financial allocation has
been made in the project budget to implement such mitigation measure, if deemed
necessary after the monitoring. The PIU would be in charge of arranging for the
implementation of necessary works.
A panel of national specialists will be recruited as consultants to review
the data collected in the monitoring program, and to determine the
necessity for mitigation measures for Sarisu Lake. The Expert Panel
will be constituted with the following members:
* ASCE (or other institute) specialists (3 persons) in fields of fisheries and aquatic
wild-life, hydrology and water quality,
* ASCE field protection staff with specific site knowledge;
* Representative of the District administration;
* Representatives of district irrigation Exploitation Units;
* PIU representative.
The Sarisu Lake Panel will meet in April, 2003. The broad scope of the duties of the
expert panel is set out in the following paragraphs, but the detailed terms of reference
will be drawn up by the PIU staff nearer the time of mobilization with assistance from
the technical assistance team.
Sarisu Lake Panel2: The general scope of the Expert Panel's responsibilities is to
determine the requirements for mitigation measures on the basis of the data collected by
the monitoring program, specifically:
* review the water level, outflow and quality data assembled during the monitoring
program;
2 The Panel will take the Ag-Gol lake into consideration (the same data is to be collected for both lakes)
because they are hydraulically connected, with Sarisu receiving the outflow from Ag-Gol.

*  assess the contribution to the lake of the pumped drainage water in quantity and
quality terms;
*  calculate and present a water balance simulation for "average" and "dry" years for
the current and after MMCD construction situations;
* estimate the differences in salinity, pH and temperature in the above two scenarios;
* review the plant and wild life surveys;
* assess the impact of the changed hydrology caused by the MMCD construction on
the ecology of the Lake;
-  advise on the necessity for a replacement water source, and if this is deemed
necessary, set out the quantity and quality requirements in "average" and "dry"
years.
Increased agrochemical pollution and surface water contamination, resulting from
increased use of pesticides and fertilizers, along with improved availability of irrigation
water would be addressed by agricultural advisory services that are being established
under the ongoing IDA supported Agricultural Development and Credit Project
(ADCP). The specialists of this service would provide extension and advisory services,
as well as training in proper application techniques, timing and handling of residues of
fertilizers and pesticides. As inputs would not anymore be available at subsidized prices
as during the time of the Former Soviet Union (FSU), the actual use of pesticides,
chemicals and fertilizers would not reach the high levels as before independence. This
more careful use of fertilizers and chemicals and the extension and advisory services is
expected to keep the negative impact of increased input use to a minimum. However, if
the condition of the drainage water would be consistently above WHO or other
international norms, increased monitoring of the collecting water source would take
place. If the recipient source's water is also above the allowable norms for longer
periods, corrective measures would have to be implemented. These would include
increased training and extension activities and possibly reduction in the use of inputs;
(iii) Indiscriminate dumping of excavated sediment deposits and other materials
from the canals, drains and structures; and
(iv)  environmental damage caused by contractors during construction activities
would both be addressed during project design and supervision.
Contractors would be required to prevent, minimize or mitigate
environmental damage. Sediments and other debris would be displaced in
an orderly manner in approved paths and landfill or dump sites, rather than
dumped indiscriminately. There would be reuse of suitable excavated
materials, limiting the need for old and new quarries. Where possible,
existing quarries would be used for required additional materials.
Contractors would also have to restore to quasi-original condition the
landscape after completion of rehabilitation works and after use of quarries.
The bidding documents would have environmental precautionary clauses, as
follows:

"The natural landscape should be preserved to the extent possible by
conducting operations in a manner that will prevent unnecessary
destruction or scarring of the natural surroundings. Except where
required for permanent works, quarries, borrow pits, staging and
processing areas, dumps and camps, all trees, saplings, and shrubbery
should be protected from unnecessary damage by project related
activities. After unavoidable damage, reseeding, replanting, or
restoration are required promptly to prevent further damage and to
restore quasi-original conditions were appropriate.
The contractor's operations should be so performed as to prevent
accidental spillage of contaminants, debris, or other pollutants,
especially into streams or underground water resources. Such
pollutants include untreated sewage and sanitary waste, tailings,
petroleum products, chemicals, biocides, mineral salts, and thermal
pollution. Wastewater, including those from aggregate processing
and concrete batching, must not enter streams without settling ponds,
gravel filters, or other processes, so as not to impair water quality or
harm aquatic life.
The contractor should ensure proper disposal of waste materials and
rubbish. If disposal by burial or fire, it should not cause negative
impact to either the air, soil nor ground water supplies.
The contractor should minimize air and water pollution emissions.
Dust from the handling or transporting of aggregates, cement, etc.,
should be minimized by sprinkling or other methods. Materials,
brush or trees should only be bumed when the owners permits, under
favorable weather conditions.
The contractor's facilities, such as warehouses, labor camps, and
storage areas, should be planned in advance to decide what the area
will look like upon completion of construction. These facilities
should be located so as to preserve the natural environment (such as
trees and other vegetation) to the maximum extent possible. After
projection construction, camps and buildings should either serve as
permanent residences and form future communities, if such use can
be foreseen and approved, or be torn down and the area restored to its
quasi-original condition in order to avoid deterioration into shanty-
towns.
Borrow pits should be landscaped and planted accordingly to an
ecological design to provide some substitute area for lost natural
landscapes and habitats."

The Development Credit Agreement would include a covenant calling for the
implementation of the Environmental Management Plan.
3.2.3    Environmental Management Arrangements
1.    The Environmental Management responsibility will be divided into three
categories:
the executing agency;
the supervising agency; and
the monitoring agency.
Three organisations will participate in the environmental monitoring and management
program with the responsibilities set out below.
The executing agency will have to assume the responsibility for: (a) the design and
assessment of the physical work options in accordance with Kyrgyz environment
regulations and/or requirements; and (b) the physical implementation of the activities
under the project, as well as the efforts to mitigate potential negative environmental
impacts.
Design engineers and contractors are part of the executing agencies. Design engineers
will be responsible for providing design options and bidding documents, taking into
account environmental protection requirements. Contractors will be responsible for the
implementation of the works in accordance with environmental requirements, as
described in the bidding documents and instructions from supervisory and monitoring
staff.
Advisory specialists are also part of the executing agencies. They will have to provide
fornal training and extension advice to water users.
The PIU is the supervising agency. It will be responsible for the timely and sound
execution of works and activities under the project. It will have responsibility for
procurement, management and supervision of the environmental monitoring program,
and will fund the program from project funds. It has to obtain required environmental
clearance from the MEP before construction activities can commence. It will also
supervise the activities by contractors and consultants during the implementation of the
rehabilitation works.
The PIU will establish an M&E cell which will have responsibility for management of
the Environmental Management Program. The duties of this cell be to recruit and
supervise the field staff, collect the data from them, check and archive it, prepare and
annual report and an annual program.

The State Committee on Ecology is identified as the primary monitoring agency for the
EMP activities.  Its specialists and inspectors will be responsible for the timely
monitoring of the agreed indicators. Specialist surveys will be conducted by District
offices of the State Committee on Ecology or will be sub-contracted to external
specialists where the study is outside their staff skills.
The routine data collection (water levels, discharges, water quality) will be conducted by
staff assigned by the District Irrigation Exploitation Units under an annually renewable
arrangement with the PIU.
Although mainly a monitoring agency, MEP will also participate in supervision of the
rehabilitation works, with emphasis on the environmental parameters, such as dumping
soil, alignment of roads and tree cutting.
In addition, the World Bank will review and approve the sub-projects from
environmental considerations and monitor the adherence to the EMP as part of its
supervision activities.
3.2.4     Costing
2.    The project budget allows for the full funding of the environmental monitoring
and mitigation of possible effects on Lake Sarisu. A detailed budget of the monitoring
arrangements is presented in Chapter 5. An allocation of US$ 175,000 has been made
in the Project's budget for mitigating the reduced water supply to Lake Sarisu, as
needed.

3.3   RIIDIA II ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING UNIT
3.3.1 General
It is proposed to create the RIIDIA II environmental monitoring unit (REMU), which
will conduct all environmental monitoring activities.
Personnel and facilities need to be brought together in an effective institutional
structure. Therefore the REMU is suggested to be established within the SAIC as one of
the sub-units of the existing RIIDIA II Project Implementation Unit (PIU). REMU will
monitor and assess the project related environmental problems faced in the SAC and
MMMC project areas and provide decision making information for the rational use and
protection of natural resources in those areas.
It can be stated that the proposed environmental monitoring programme with an
organised environmental monitoring unit will be the first one for Azerbaijan. Therefore

the RIDIIA II may be seen as a model for monitoring of irrigation/drainage project
related environmental impacts. Thus, this project will derive benefits for the
institutional capacity building in Azerbaijan. It is recommended to Transfer REMU to
ASCE after the five years RIIDIA implementation period.
3.3.2 Environmental Legislation
There are more than 20 laws, regulations and standards related to the environment,
water resources and irrigation sub-sector in Azerbaijan (See Annex B.1). This
legislation is a combination of different acts which were accepted at different dates.
However, most of the environmental acts are inadequate for market economy and
transition period. The most important element of the existing environmental legislation
is the part which were accepted after 1991, because this part of the legislation were
prepared considering the market reforms.
The "Handbook for the Environmental Impact Assessment Process in Azerbaijan
(HEIAPA)" was prepared in association with UNDP and is evidently based on
procedures developed in Europe and North America. EIA is potentially a vital tool for
environmental protection during construction and operation of irrigation and drainage
system. However, the HELAPA explains the EIA procedures as a complex and
bureaucratic 21-step procedures for the existing environmental legislation.
According to the existing environmental legislation, in particular Environmental Law,
Water Code, Irrigation and Land Reclamation Law and HEIAPA, SAIC and ASCE are
the responsible authorities for the monitoring of the environmental impacts of the SAC
and MMMC projects.
It was considered that the existing environmental legislation is adequate and provides an
up-to-date scheme of law based on the necessary principles for creation of a good
environmental monitoring in the project areas. In particular, the Articles No. 24; 39; 40
(Environmental Law), Article No. 44 (Water Code) and Article No. 16 (Irrigation and
Land Reclamnation Law) refer to the necessary administrative and legal power to
irrigation and drainage authorities to carry out effective anid project specific
environmental monitoring.
The SAIC has to get an Environmental Permission from  the Azerbaijan State
Committee on Ecology and the Control of the Natural Resource Utilisation (ASCE)
before the implementation of the projects can start. According to the existing
environmental legislation, SAIC is the applicant. The application for Environmental
Permission includes the previous environmental impact assessment study carried out by
the Consultant in 1999 during the execution of the RIIDIA II Feasibility Study. In
addition SAIC has to carry out an environmental monitoring programme. The
parameters to be monitored form the part of an agreement between SAIC and ASCE;
they are subject of the present study.

3.3.3 Institutions Involved
The State Amelioration and Irrigation Committee, State Environmental Committee,
State Committee for Hydrometeorology, Committee for Geology and Mineral Resources
of Azerbaijan, Ministry of Health, State Committee for Housing and Communal
Services, Azerbaijan Fisheries Agency, State Committee for Construction and
-Architecture and Committee for State Statistics of Azerbaijan Republic are
governmental organisations having responsibilities on the establishment and operation
of the irrigation infrastructure and monitoring of different environmnental and social
aspects.
The State Amelioration and Irrigation Committee (SAIC) is responsible for provision of
water for agricultural needs, operation, maintenance and repair of main irrigation canals,
drainage collectors and pumping stations, off-farm irrigation infrastructure, regulation of
surface water, flood alleviation and mud slides protection, control and monitoring of
conditions of irrigated areas. There are Hydrogeological and Land Reclamation Services
within the SAIC which are carrying out monitoring programmes for the control of
irrigated lands. Their main emphasis is to observe the salinization process in the Kura-
Araz lowland.
The State Environmental Committee (ASCE) is responsible for the protection of the
atmosphere, terrestrial environment, aquatic environment, management of conservation
areas and wetlands for protection of fauna and flora, monitoring of surface water, issue
of licenses for water abstraction from and for discharges into surface waters, inspection
of cases of accidental pollution spillages and the implementation of EIA procedures
since 1992 when the Environmental act was promulgated. The procedures for the EIA
have been clearly identified in the "Handbook for the EIA process in Azerbaijan" which
is approved and issued by the ASCE.
The State Committee for Hydrometeorological (SCH) monitors quantity and quality and
river flow as well as meteorological parameters. The observation points include 47 river
gauges and 4 reservoirs, resulting in more than 1000 samples per year.
The Committee for Geology and Mineral Resources of Azerbaijan (CGMR) is responsible
for control and exploitation of groundwater and of all minerals other than oil and natural
gas, they issue licenses for ground water abstraction, they also control and monitor
groundwater level and groundwater quality. CGMR carries out water quality analyses at
211 boreholes monitored nation-wide three times per year.
Ministry of Health (MoH) has a Center of Epidemiology and Hygiene which is
responsible for monitoring the quality and safety of drinking water supplies throughout
the country, including sampling and analysis, setting the quality standards for drinking
water, monitoring the quality of sewage discharged to receiving waters. The center has
42 local units. The central laboratory in Baku is considered to be effective, but regional
units in the project areas are not furnished to carry out laboratory analyses.

State Committee for Housing and Communal Services (SCHCS) is responsible for
provision of safe drinking water in the rural areas, including monitoring of water quality
from source to point of supply. SHCSC has 51 local units (Vodokanal), including 10
units in each of the districts allocated in the project areas. SHCSC is also responsible for
control and supervision of wastewater management in the rural areas, provision of
wastewater service, monitoring and quality control of wastewater.
Azerbaijan Fisheries Agency (AFA) is responsible for protection, promotion and
.regulation of fishery in rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and Azerbaijan territorial waters in
Caspian Sea.
Azerbaijan Forestry Agency (AFORA) is responsible for forest management and
aforestration, protection and regulation of forest resources, including forest flora and
fauna, also soil conservation in the mountainous and highland areas.
State Committee for Construction and Architecture (SCCA) is the responsible
organisation for development strategies, policies, norms and standards within design and
construction, and for control and management that norms and standards are followed
during construction.
Committee for State Statistics of Azerbaijan Republic (CSSAR) is responsible for the
collecting and editing of the figures in social aspects, such as population, education etc.
Most of the Azerbaijan governmental organisations and institutes are capable of
obtaining and evaluating data for their own requirements, which are listed above (See
Annex B.2). To process and to adapt their data under the proposed REMU requires
considerable efforts.
REMU is suggested to have co-ordination and collaboration with these governmental
organisations and institutes for the monitoring of environment and assessment of results
through the existing hierarchy of SAIC. In many cases, it is cost effective for REMU to
carry out the environmental monitoring activities on related fields by means of
consultancy agreements made with these governmental organisations and institutes.
3.3.4 Organisational Arrangements to sustain the Environmental Monitoring
System
The organisational set-up of the REMU has been discussed and agreed upon with the
SAIC and other related institutes. The set-up is shown in Figure 3.1. According to the
present environmental legislation, SAIC has to conduct the-monitoring of environmental
impacts of the RIIDIA II Project within the project areas. Therefore REMU is proposed
to be established under the existing hierarchy of the SAIC where it should form a sub-
unit of the RIIDIA II Project Implementation Unit, PIU. The principle tasks of the
REMU are outlined in the following:

One of the components of REMU could be a GIS group in order to effectively handle
and process the data.
The Consultant considers the GIS group to be an optional entity of the REMU. The GIS
group could be replaced by a stronger data processing group which does not have the
GIS software facilities. However, the staff and hardware requirements would be almost
the sane as those for the GIS group. The international expert would be required for set-
up of the data base and for support of the Head of REMU. Consequently, the cost
savings from not having GIS are considered marginal.

REMU will have two different regional units within the existing regional offices of
SAIC for the co-ordination and collection of continuously observed hydrological and
hydrogeological data and delivering these data to the REMU.
The establishment of REMU (GIS option) calls for basic equipment, this will require a
budget for investment costs of SUS4,380. (see Table 3.1). In the other case the REMU
(non-GIS option) its set-up cost become $US6,860 including one additional PC, one
printer and one auxiliary power supply (UPS). (See

REMU's management, mobilisation of the resources and the Consultants, organisation
of the laboratory works and field surveys, procurement and operation of equipment, GIS
training, quality control and reporting and budget set-up . For liaison with the involved
organisations the PIU head is responsible. The data processing specialist will be
responsible for the operation of the data base and to conduct data inputs. The head of the
unit and the data processing specialist will have a full time job.
The REMU's sub-unit staff are responsible for data collection from the local and
regional organisations, checking of information, preparation of required reports for
REMU. They will establish relationships with local interested organisations and
individual shareholders, to assist the local Consultants for data collection and field
survey on the places. The budget needs for the REMU staff are shown in Table 3.4.

3.3.4.2 Reporting Requirements
REMU's main task will be to provide decision making information for environmental
management in the considered MMMC and SAC monitoring areas. With its capacity to
recruit consultants and institutes it has the possibility to integrate considerable expertise
in the environment related fields. REMU's primary task therefore should be to inform in
detail about the environmental situation in both project areas on the basis of most actual
data and corresponding expert assessment. The reporting should be carried annually
about two months after the end of the monitoring campaigns. It should be addressed to
the SAIC from where it is to be distributed to other involved parties.
The reports should comprise the detailed assessments of the involved experts. These
will assess the present situation as found during the actual monitoring campaign as well
as the situation as it developed since the start of the project implementation. The report
would clearly show negative developments and detail proposals for remedial measures
that were elaborated by professional experts (e.g. by PIU's TA). Further on the report
should state the status of the database as well as difficulties and constraints concerning
data acquisition. If certain key indicators do not show a significant response to the
infrastructural measures these have to be identified in the report and it will be discussed
whether their observation should be carried on. For administrative purposes the report
also has to show the budget requirements for the campaign that is reported on and for
the up-coming one.
The PIU should be responsible to make the REMU data available for project
monitoring.
3.4   MONITORING SCHEDULE
In the following paragraphs the environmental monitoring programme will be
introduced. In compliance with the presently carried out assessment the programme will
be set up to monitor environmentally relevant parameters from different fields, these
are:
* Natural Parks and Biodiversity
* Hydrological and Hydrogeological Flow Regimes
* Soil degradation and land use
* Water Quality
* Health

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector         MONITORING
* Socio-economic situation
For each of the above topics key indicators and corresponding observation intervals will
be defined. The time span after which different parameters react to the infrastructural
measures is supposed to be different. While groundwater levels may respond rapidly,
socio-economic indicators may need considerably more time. Because of these different
reaction times the Consultant suggests a total monitoring time which will insure, that
even the slowly socio-economic indicators will have a chance to respond. A monitoring
time of 8 to ten years was discussed with the client and agreed upon as adequate.
The environmental monitoring should be carried out before, during and after the
construction. In
Figure 3.2, a tentative monitoring schedule is proposed for the SAC and the MMMC
monitoring areas.

quo for all above mentioned topics. In case of the hydrological and geohydrological
observation it has to be used to finally identify locations for gauging stations, to set
these up and to initiate the daily and monthly observations. Further on the first campaign
will set up the basis for the data processing, and data handling in the REMU. This
comprises the data-base preparation and, if decided on, the implementation of the GIS.
Alike all others the first monitoring campaign should have a length of 3 months during
which all required surveys evaluations and assessments should be carried out. During
the first campaign an international expert (e.g. project experienced GIS expert) should
-assist the Head of the REMU in performing his tasks. At the end of the first campaign a
revised monitoring schedule should be presented to the SAIC.
According to
Figure 3.2, monitoring related consulting and expert activities should be concentrated in
periods of three months per year. This eases communication among experts and also
facilities co-ordination works of the REMU. For the time being it is proposed to
concentrate the required campaigns during the months of July until November.
The annual campaigns should differ from each other in relation to the topics observed.
Basically three different types of campaigns are proposed. They are detailed in es since
project implementation
Table 3.5. The standard campaign comprises all topics, except socio-economy, which is
expected to respond slowly. Therefore it is included every second year. In the sixth year
a soil survey is proposed, which also considers the change in land use since project
implementation; satellite image interpretation is the adequate means for this. A detailed
socio-economic study is proposed for the sixth campaign. Alike the soil monitoring it
should reflect on the changes since project implementation

3.5   NATURAL PARKS AND BIODIVERSITY
The objective of the monitoring is to regularly assess and control the impacts of the
infrastructural project measures on the natural parks and their biodiversity. The
monitoring is defined by the observed key parameters and the respective sampling
locations, as well as by the schedule of the observations and their assessment. For the
monitoring the following entities are discussed: Deveci lake hunting reserve in the SAC
monitoring area and the the Ag gol and Sarisu lakes in the MMMC monitoring area with
their rare and endangered species. The mentioned aspects are detailed in the following
paragraphs.
3.5.1 Key Environmental Indicators
The environmental indicators in the MMMC monitoring area are proposed to be as
follows:
*  Plant types and the areas occupied by them in the Ag gol and Sarisu lake area, e.g.
Biebersteine (TulpaBiebersteiniana Schult) plant specie at the Kardon site of the Ag
gol lake
* Water quality (pH and salinity) of the Ag gol and Sarisu lakes,
* Number of birds and their nesting and feeding places

The indicators were chosen to observe and assess the effects of infrastructural measures
on the water quality of the lakes as well as their effects on the fauna and flora of these
areas. The observation of the spreading of plants may be correlated to water level
changes which will be observed in the hydrological monitoring.
For the SAC monitoring area this is the water quality of the Deveci lake (pH and
salinity), which is further discussed under water quality monitoring.
3.5.2 Monitoring Schedule (sample points, sample period, personnel)
Ag gol State Protected Area is regularly observed by the Agjabadi District office of
ASCE. It is proposed that both of the lakes are to be monitored by this district office. Its
observations should be supported by the REMS in technical (pH meter and conductivity
meter) and financial terms. In return, the observation results should be handed out to
the REMU.
The monitoring covers different seasons of the year to cope with the nesting and
wintering periods of birds as well as with vegetation period and spawning and migration
period of the fishes.
The observations are proposed to start before the construction and to carry on 5 to 8
years after the construction will have been completed.
It is planned to occupy one biological expert for 45 days per year; during the observation
periods (March to end of September) he should work 30 days. Additional 15 days
should be considered for assessment and report writing to the REMU. He is also
responsible for controlling and data collection from the regions and to conduct
laboratory analysis for fish. All data collected will be handed over to the REMU in
processed form at the end of each annual monitoring campaign.

3.5.3 Requirements for Monitoring Equipment and Laboratories
The only equipment needed for omitological observations is a binocular, for water
quality it is a pH meter and a conductivity meter. Some utensils, nets, boots, cooling
boxes are required for monitoring of fishes. In addition it is expected from the consulted
biological expert to analyse the roe of fishes in his own laboratory with the provided
utensils. The expert's laboratory is expected to be sufficiently equipped to cope with the
tasks.
3.5.4 Regulations for Data Handling, Processing and Evaluation
The observations will be carried out by field staff. The respective data will be compiled
in special forms which will be explained in the following paragraphs. Additional data
can also be collected from Azerbaijan Fisheries Agency and ASCE. At the end of
September of each year all the data have to be collected by the biological expert who
will analyse and assess them. He also is responsible for data processing and submission
of information to the REMU.
3.5.5 Report Requirements
At the end of each annual monitoring campaign the biological expert will report on the
monitoring results from the recent campaign. In his report he has to state on the present
conditions and on changes with respect to previous campaigns. The report has to be
written in a simple and understandable manner. Important findings have to be worked
out in detail. Negative developments have to be fully addressed in a special chapter. In
co-operation with the Head of the REMU measures have to be proposed to remedy the
negative trends.
The annual report has to comprise all field observation in paper form. For field
observations standard reporting forms should be applied for the plants, birds, fishes, as
well as for water level and discharge readings.

3.6   HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROGEOLOGICAL FLOW REGIMES
The SAC and the MMMC project both deal with the management of water resources.
The SAC project is considered to improve water supply for irrigation and to Baku. The
MMMC project concentrates on the solving of drainage problems in already irrigated
areas. Both projects are assumed to affect the water household of the respective areas.
The regular monitoring will form the basis for a sound assessment of the impacts these
projects will have on the water resources, including surface and ground water. For the
MMMC monitoring area the proposed programme will take into consideration the Kura
and Araz rivers, and the Ag gol and Sarisu lakes. For the SAC monitoring area the
Deveci lake should be monitored. Other effects on the hydrological regime are not likely
to occur in the SAC area.

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector  MONITORING
3.6.1 Key Environmental Indicators
Indicators in the MMMC monitoring area are selected to allow the assessment of the
impacts of the new collector on the water balances of the Ag gol and Sarisu lake as well
as on the groundwater household in the MMMC monitoring area. The collectors (K2
and K3) feed the lakes. The flow regimes of the Kura and Araz rivers are not directly
related to the project measures. Therefore the Kura and Araz rivers will not be
monitored within the hydrological monitoring programme.
According to the previous stated, the environmental indicators in the MMMC
monitoring area are proposed to be as follows:
I. Inflow and outflow of the Ag gol and Sarisu lakes; and flows in K2 and K3
collectors;
2. Water levels of the Ag gol and Sarisu lakes;
3. Ground water levels; and
4. Climatological parameters as air temperature, humidity, wind, precipitation and
evaporation at Imishli district.
The rehabilitation of the upper 50 km of the SAC will neither effect the hydrological
regime of the Samur river nor of any of the local rivers crossed within the respective
canal reach. However, in the future lower canal losses and improved irrigation
management may reflect on reduced demands for local stream flow, consequently the
Deveci Lake might recover from past and present scarcity of freshwater inflows.
Accordingly the environmental indicators in the SAC monitoring area are proposed to
be as follows:
1. Climatological parameters on air temperature, humidity, wind, precipitation and
evaporation at Khachmaz district, and
2. Inflows to Deveci lake and its water levels
3.6.2 Monitoring Schedule
Hydrological and groundwater sampling locations in the MMMC monitoring area are
shown in Figure 3.3 and in the SAC monitoring area are shown in Figure 3.4. In both of
the monitoring areas a total of 15 sampling points is proposed for hydrological
observation, additional 5 sampling points are proposed to enable the monitoring of the
groundwater regime.
In the MMMC area the hydrological gauging points are selected to allow for the water
balances of the lakes. The collectors (K3 and K2) feeding the Ag gol and Sarisu lakes
should be observed by Q1 and Q6. The outflows from the lakes should be observed by
Q4 and Q5. Additional inflows of irrigation excess water via P-1 and P-12-1 should be

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector        MONITORING
monitored at Q7 and Q8 respectively. The MMMC sea outfalls are suggested to be
monitored at Q9. Flow information from two regular Kura gauges and from one regular
Araz gauge should be considered also. Groundwater gauges are proposed to assess the
efficiency of the new MMMC collector. Three gauges are placed along the reach of new
collector (GW3, GW4 and GW5) and one is located near to the Karabakh Canal (GWl),
a fifth one (GW2) is located between the Kl and K2 collectors.
In the SAC area two hydrological gauges are proposed to monitor the hydrological
.balance of the Deveci Lake. Therefore one station should be installed on the
Shabranchay river to assess the inflows to the lake, a second station should be installed
at the lake to observe the fluctuation of the its water level.
The hydrological observations are planned to be started immediately after the
implementation of the gauging stations, they should go on for at least 5 years after the
construction has been finished. The gauging stations should be set up during the first
monitoring campaign. The monitoring schedule is detailed in Table 3. 10.
It is proposed to occupy one hydrologist for 45 days for the co-ordination and the
assessment of the observations. The hydrologist will be charged to conduct the site
selections of the hydrometric and groundwater gauges during 4 days at the initiation of
the monitoring programme. Additionally he will carry out 2 field trips (4 days in total)
each year to both of the monitoring areas to control the field observations.
3.6.3 Requirements for Monitoring Equipment-and Laboratories
The proposed monitoring programme requires hydrometric equipment in form of 2
current meters (1 for the SAC monitoring area and 1 for the MMMC monitoring area).
For some river gauging stations (to be selected during the first campaign) a cable car
should be provided to allow suspension measurements across the rivers/canals (4 in
total, except the sampling points in the lake area) and a topographic point (15 in total)
should be set-up. 15 staff gauges should be provided for water level readings at the
gauging points.

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector  MONITORING
For groundwater monitoring in the MMMC area the drilling of 5 new wells should be
considered. In the SAC area groundwater should be observed sporadically in the vicinity
of the Deveci lake at an existing observation well. To measure the ground water levels 5
well depth meters are proposed.
3.6.4 Regulations for Data Handling, Processing and Evaluation
The observation results obtained both from daily and monthly measurements at the
hydrological and hydrogeological sampling points will be recorded by the field
observers. The field observers will deliver monthly the observation results to the
regional data handling unit that are proposed to be functioning at the regional offices of
SAIC in the SAC and MMMC monitoring areas. The staff in these units will collect,
assure and control the data and then send them to the REMU which will be in contact
with the hydrological expert. The hydrological expert will start to assess the data in
November. At the end of first year of the monitoring, the hydrologist is expected to
prepare graphics of the flow versus depth curves for all of the hydrological sampling
points. He will share the water level information on Ag gol and Sarisu and Deveci lakes
with the biological expert. All the data he has collected need to be installed into a data
base which will enable him to compare and assess the hydrological regime in time
sequences. This data base will also be installed at the REMU.
Each year at the end of September climatological data on monthly average air
temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, evaporation for Khachmaz and Imishli
districts will be obtained by the SAIC from the State Hydrometeorological Committee
and delivered through REMU to the hydrological expert.
3.6.5 Report Requirements
At the end of each annual monitoring campaign the water resources expert will work out
a detailed assessment of the present situation based on the actual information of the
ending campaign. This report will comprise hydrology, hydrogeology and climatology.
The assessment includes the Ag gol and Sarisu lakes, and the Deveci lake as well as
ground water levels in the two monitoring areas. The assessment will also address the
relevant climatological data from Kachmaz and Imishli station.
To allow for an assessment of the development of the water resources the report will
relate the present results to those from previous monitoring campaigns. Any negative
trends will be clearly identified in a separate chapter. This chapter would be followed by

recommendations to remedy these negative developments. The respective remedial
measures will have been co-ordinated with the Head of the REMU and with other
experts, if required.
Each annual report will state on the requirements for gauging stations and equipment.
The necessity for each gauging station will be assessed annually. This will help REMU
to set-up an realistic budget for the coming campaign.
The report will be submitted to the REMU on request of REMU head. The document
will contain the assessment and all measured and calculated data of the ending year. The
data will be provided to REMU in form of listings and in digital format.
3.5.6 Standardised Report Forms
The reporting forms from surface and ground water levels and flow measurements are
provided in the Annex B.4 in Azeri language. These forms are set up to be used by the
field observers.
3.5.7 Monitoring Personnel and Training Needs
The monitoring will be co-ordinated by one consulted water resources expert. He is also
responsible for data management, the assessments and the reporting as well as for
training of field personnel. Hydrometric and groundwater measurements will be carried
out by 14 field observers. For each of the sampling points an unskilled field observer is
suggested to measure water level in the wells and at the hydrometric gauges. Surface
water level and flow measurements at the outlet of Ag gol will be conducted by one
single field observer. It will be the same for Sarisu lake and for the Deveci lake. Field
observers will be selected from the nearest by locations, they should be reliable and
have a good reputation. For the Ag gol lake (Q I and Q3) water level reading is proposed
to be performed by the local staff of ASCE. The observed data will be reported monthly
by the field observers to the SAIC's regional offices. The regional offices will be
responsible to collect the data and control the field observations, as well as to deliver the
achieved data to REMU.
3.6.8 Budget needs
For the set up of the water resources monitoring a budget of $US 2,965 is assumed. This
amount includes hydrometric equipment and training as well as site selection and

3.7   SOIL DEGRADATION AND LAND USE
The SAC rehabilitation project offers the possibilities for an intensification of irrigation
in the SAC monitoring area. The irrigation of land may lead to the reduction in soil
fertility, water logging in areas of shallow groundwater tables or to introduction of toxic
elements into the soil by intensive agrochemical usage. Furthermore, a probable change
in land usage due to irrigation activities has to be taken into account. The MMMC
project deals with the improvement of the soil conditions by means of developing the
drainage infrastructure.
Both projects are expected to effect the soil conditions. An adequate tool to investigate
the impacts on the soil is a regular monitoring. In both surveying areas the main
objectives of the monitoring programme will be to evaluate the changes in the
meliorative conditions of the soil in relation to the implementation of the irrigation and
drainage schemes. To achieve these aims any change in soil quality or land use has to be
detected and assessed. On this basis preventive measures can be proposed by the
REMU.
To achieve the maximum information it is essential to define key environmental
indicators, the sampling points and the monitoring schedule. At last the budget has to be
proposed for set-up and operation of the soil monitoring;
3.7.1 Key Environmental Indicators
Main environmental indicators concerning the meliorative conditions of irrigated soils
are as follows:
* Salinity of the irrigated soils defined by type and area;
* Microelements in the soil (nutrients and pesticides),
* Conditions of the irrigation canals and collectors;
* Crop pattern and land usage
* Groundwater regime and salinity conditions
The construction of the new collector in the MMMC area is expected to have a positive
impact on the soil quality, especially on its salinity. Agricultural land usage will also
change due to improved land conditions. The reconstruction and rehabilitation of SAC
takes into consideration intensified irrigation water usage which may lead to the reverse
case, e.g. the rise in groundwater level within the areas near to the coastal zone.

3.7.2 Monitoring Schedule (sampling locations, sampling period, personnel)
Soil sampling locations in the MMMC and the SAC monitoring area are shown in
Figure 3.5 and Figure 3.6, respectively. To get an accurate idea of the soil quality at each
monitoring area 10 sarnpling points are proposed. In Annex A. 12 both the present and
proposed sampling points are shown with their co-ordinates.
The consultant proposes two different soil sampling campaigns. The aims of the first
-campaign, which will be carried out twice per year, is to investigate the chemical
properties of the soil, with main focus on salinity. The first group of samples will be
collected between March and April. The second group of samples will be collected
between September and October. Additional to the sample collection the conditions of
the collectors will be visually observed. The second campaign is proposed to investigate
the changes of the mechanical properties of soil and will be conducted in the first year
and after 6 years. The second campaign will be conducted at 4 sampling points of each
monitoring area (see Annex A.12).
Within the second campaign a satellite image- or air photographs- processing will be
carried out to assess the change in land use. The Yalama-Khachmaz forest area will be
included in this survey.
The soil expert will be responsible for the sampling and the assessment of the soil
degradation and / or improvement. It is proposed to occupy him for 40 days during
which he is expected to carry out 4 field trips (8 days in total) each year to both of the
monitoring areas in order to perform the sampling.

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector   MONITORING
The chemical and other remaining mechanical analysis of soil will be carried out at a
fully equipped soil laboratory. The use of satellite imagery is the most effective method
to investigate the land use changes in project areas as great as the SAC and the MMMC.
These images are thought to be processed by the proposed REMU GIS group. Without
the GIS-system the land use has to be carried out by air photographs which would take
additional 4 expert months.
3.7.4 Regulations for Data Handling
The soil expert is advised to take the samples from a location at least 100 metres away
from collector and/or inter-farm collectors to get a reasonable sample. Three samples
will be collected from each sampling point at depth of 0 to 25 cm; 25 to 50 cm and 50 to
100 cm. This is the minimum required number of samples that can be collected from
one point to identify the chemical and mechanical properties. Together with the field
assistant the soil expert will collect these samples from each depth represented above
and put them into previously labelled bags. Additional, three samples obtained from
each sampling point will be put into a single pouch which label includes the number of
sampling point and the date. The pre-defined sampling points should not be moved.
The report of the field trip should also include an evaluation of the condition of the
collectors.
An appropriated satellite image for the land use assessment needs to be obtained from
the relevant agency representing the present state of the usage on June or July
(vegetation period) of the second campaign.
The soil expert will start to assess the data in November, sharing the land use
information with the biological expert.
3.7.5 Report Requirements
At the end of each annual monitoring campaign the soil expert will work out a detailed
assessment of the present situation based on the actual information. This report will
comprise chemical and mechanical properties, conditions of collectors and land use.
The comparison of present and previous soil analyses allows to identify trends of soil
improvement or degradation. In case of the latter one. This chapter shall be followed by
recommendations to remedy degradative changes that will be worked out and detailed in
a special chapter. The respective remedial measures will have to be co-ordinated with
the Head of the REMU and with other experts, if required.

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector   MONITORING
After six years a detailed analysis of land use changes will be worked out on the basis of
change detection methods, applied to the 1998 satellite images and the latest available at
that time (e.g. those of summer 2005).
Each annual report will state on the requirements of sampling points and equipment as
well as on maintenance requirements of the collectors. The necessity for each sampling
point will be assessed annually which will help REMU to set-up a realistic budget for
the coming campaign.
The report will be submitted to the REMU on request of REMU head. The document
will contain the assessment and all measured and evaluated data of the ending year. The
data will be provided to REMU in form of listings and in digital format.
3.7.6 Standard Reporting Requirements
The results from the soil analyses will be processed in a standardised form. For this
purpose a field analysis form is shown in the Annex B.5 in Azeri. This forms will be
used for field work and to report the laboratory analysis.
3.7.7 Monitoring Personnel and Training Needs
The monitoring will be co-ordinated by one consulted soil expert. He also will be
responsible for the sampling, data management and the assessment as well as for
reporting. The other members of the monitoring team are formed by one technical
assistant for each of the monitoring areas. The two field assistants will be trained by the
expert in the field. During the field work field assistants are expected to manage
sampling and recording.
3.7.8 Budget Needs
The costs for soil degradation and land use monitoring need to be distinguished in set-
up costs and annual costs. This is considered in the tables listed below.
For the required equipment already mentioned a budget of $US 13,835 is assumed. This
sum also comprises the expenditures for 3 Landsat images to be purchased after six
years.
The annual costs to conduct the first campaign (type a) for chemical properties of the
soil are $US 1,999. Those for the second campaign (type b) (mechanical soil properties)
are $US 1,274. Type b is carried out during the first year and after six years, type a is
carried out during all other campaigns. Consequently the average annual costs are
$US4,485. Without GIS support the type b campaign would require addition budget of
$US 1,200. This would increase the average annual cost to the $US4,785.

3.8   WATER QUALITY
According to the previous water quality assessment some effects on the future water
quality may be expected from the implementation of the proposed infrastructural
measures. The verification of this assumption requires a systematic monitoring. This
should be carried out before, during and after the construction.
The water quality monitoring will be carried out in the MMMC and in the SAC
monitoring area. It will concentrate on physical, hydrochemical and microbiological
parameters to assess the suitability of water for irrigation purposes; for potable water
purposes also bacteriological criteria is considered.
For the MMMC monitoring area the monitoring program will consider water quality
assessments for the K2 and K3 collectors and of P-I and P-1 2-1 irrigation canals as well
as for the Ag gol and the Sarisu lakes. Water quality of the lakes will be based on the
criteria for fish life. (Annex A.6) The Kura river and the Araz river will be surveyed as
they form important resources for Baku water supply. At the bottom end of the MMMC
water quality will be monitored in the sea outfall and offshore. Last but not least quality
of groundwater will be considered also. In the MMMC area water quality may be
affected by the improved drainage conditions. This may mainly be the case for Kura and
Araz rivers. However, negative developments could arise if for example the water

balance of the lakes would be changed negatively or if increased agricultural activities
would lead to an intensified use of agrochemical.
In the SAC monitoring area water quality of the Deveci lake and its inflow will be
monitored.
3.8.1 Key Indicators
The above mentioned water courses are used for drinking water supply, irrigation water
supply, and for drainage of irrigated areas. In addition Ag gol, Sarisu and Deveci lakes
are considered to have ecological importance.
It is found that the required water quality information cannot necessarily be obtained
from existing observation networks that are operated by the State Hydrometeorological
Agency.
Water quality will be assessed according to its physical, chemical and microbiological
characteristics. The parameters listed at the Table 3.19 are selected to monitor the water
quality in both of the areas.
3.8.2 Monitoring Schedule
The annual water quality monitoring of the MMMC and SAC monitoring areas is
suggested to be carried out at different sampling intervals. In the MMMC monitoring
area sampling points of the Kura and Araz rivers should be monitored twice per year;
once at the maximum flow period (March-April) the second sample should be taken
during the low flow period (August-September). From collectors, canals and the Ag gol,
Sarisu and Deveci lakes two samples should be taken, one before and one at the end of
the vegetation period. The offshore sampling at the mouth of the MMMC should be
carried out at least once a year in September. PH, EC and temperature should be
monitored at the lakes at weekly intervals. The groundwater sampling at both of the
monitoring areas will be carried out twice per year; once in April and once in
September.

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector  MONITORING
The water quality monitoring program is proposed to last for 5 to 6 years.
One water quality expert will be responsible for the collection of the samples and for the
assessment of analysis. He will be charged for 6 days for the collection of samples from
both of the project areas (2 days in the MMMC monitoring area and 4 days in the SAC
monitoring area) and additionally for 54 days for the assessment of the laboratory
analysis and preparing a report to the REMU. He should be employed for 60 days in
total.
3.8.3 Requirements for Monitoring Equipment and Laboratories
The physical parameters (water temperature, pH, turbidity, colour and dissolved oxygen)
will be observed under natural conditions directly in the field.
All other water analyses will be carried in a hydrochemical laboratory. For
bacteriological and hydrochemical analyses samples will be carried in sterile conditions
in a portable refrigerator. The bacteriological measurements will be conducted in the
existing local laboratories at both of the monitoring area. The transportation time for the
bacteriological samples should not be more than 6 hours.
3.8.4 Regulations for Data Handling, Processing and Evaluation
The water samples will be analysed in the field and in an adequate laboratory according
to standard procedures which are supervised by the water quality expert. The results
from the analyses will be processed in a standardised form. For this purpose a field
analysis form is shown in the Annex B.6. For the laboratory results other corresponding
forms will be used.
The results from the annual water quality campaign will be processed and evaluated by
the water quality expert. The data will be stored by the expert in digital form in an
appropriate data base. The evaluation will comprise the revision of the recent laboratory
analyses, checks on plausibility and the assessment of the current situation and how it
has to be seen in relation to the situation in previous years. The processed data and the
raw data will be handed out to the REMU where they are integrated into the REMU
database. The outcomes of the evaluation will be handed out to REMU in form of an
appropriate report.
3.8.5 Report Requirements
At the end of each annual monitoring campaign the water quality expert will report on
the monitoring results from the recent campaign to the REMU. The report assesses the

present conditions and details the changes with respect to previous campaigns. It should
also contain an assessment of the physical water quality parameters that are measured in
the context of the bio-monitoring for Ag gol and Sarisu lakes. The report has to be
written in a simple and understandable manner. Important findings have to be worked
out in detail. Negative developments have to be fully addressed in a special chapter. In
co-operation with the Head of the REMU measures have to be proposed to remedy the
negative trends.
-The Teport will clearly work out the suitability of water for irrigation purposes and for
drinking water purposes. All relevant parameters will be addressed and assessed
according to national normns (SanPIN 4630-88, Moscow, 1988, Law of protection of
superficial waters from pollution by waste water, Baku, 1994) and international
standards (WHO, 1993; Guidelines for drinking-water quality, Vol. 1) (see Annex AS)
The report also states on the necessities how to carry on with the monitoring in the
future. This for example includes the identification of no longer needed sample taking or
the need for additional analyses and sampling. On the basis of this information REMU
will be enabled to propose update budget requirements for the next monitoring
campaign.
3.8.6 Monitoring Personnel and Training Needs
The monitoring team comprises 3 members, one water quality expert and one field
assistant for the SAC and one for the MMMC area. The two field assistants will be
trained by the expert in the field. During this field work field assistants are expected to
manage sampling, e.g. preparation of sampling, sampling, fixing of samples and their
transportation.
3.8.7 Budget Needs
The costs for water quality monitoring need to be distinguished in set-up costs and
annual costs. This is carried out in the following paragraphs.
3.8.7.1 Budget Needsfor Set-up of Monitoring
All required laboratory equipment is expected to be available in the laboratory of the
consulted water quality expert. However, for the necessary field sampling appropriate
equipment is required. This includes laboratory glass container of capacity 1 litre, pH-
meter, EC-meter, thermometer and a portable refrigerator. The respective costs are
detailed in Table 3.20. The total cost for set-up of monitoring is $US3,872.

3.9   HEALTH SITUATION
The SAC and the MMMC projects both deal with the management of water and land
resources. People use water for drinking, cooking and irrigation, they use the soil to
grow crops and to feed their domestic animals. The hygienic quality of water and food
depends on the sanitary and hygienic conditions of these resources. Changes in the
hygienic conditions of these resources are reflected in the health statistics. The SAC
project is considered as an irrigation project; this project may cause water logging
problems and increase number of malaria cases. Besides, the SAC project provides
additional water supply to Baku. The MMMC project concentrates on solving of

drainage problems in already irrigated areas. This project is assumed to improve the
health conditions in the region, as much as the reuse of the collector water is avoided.
This also includes the consideration of the Kura river which is used downstream as
drinking water resource.
The regular monitoring will form the basis for a sound assessment of the impacts that
the projects will have on the health conditions. For the MMMC monitoring area the
proposed programme will take into consideration health statistics of Imishli district and
.Kura river data for drinking water. For the SAC monitoring area the monitoring will
consider SAC water as drinking water resource and health statistics of the Khachmaz
district. The key environmental indicators, the sampling points and the monitoring
schedule are selected to achieve the maximum information to assess the status of the
health situation. Finally the budget needs for setting up and operation of the monitoring
programme are detailed.
The health statistic are regularly recorded by the district offices of the Ministry of
Health (MoH).
3.9.1  Key Environmental Indicators
Indicators in the MMMC and SAC monitoring areas are selected to allow the
assessment of the health impacts of the new collector and of the rehabilitated canal.
The environmental indicators in the MMMC and SAC monitoring areas are proposed to
be as following:
1. Main infective diseases in relation to water supplies at Imishli district in the MMMC
monitoring area and at Khachmaz district in the SAC monitoring area; and
2. Microbiological water quality of the Kura river in the MMMC monitoring area and
of the SAC water in the SAC monitoring area.
The health indicators in both of the areas will deal with the health statistics. hnishli
district is proposed to be the hygienic monitoring zone of the MMMC monitoring area
and Khachmaz district is proposed to be the respective zone of the SAC monitoring
area, both proposals were discussed and agreed upon during the workshop of 4 August,
1999. Inishli district health statistics on water bome and water related diseases will
show the efficiency of the new collector and its management. Health statistics of
Khachmaz district is expected to be a good indicator for the impact of irrigation on the
health situation in the SAC monitoring area.

3.9.2 Monitoring Schedule
The Imishli district in the MMMC monitoring area and Khachmaz district in the SAC
area will be regularly monitored to obtain the information on health situation. Health
statistic of these districts will be recorded monthly by the epidemiologist.
The microbiological quality of the Kura river and the SAC water will be monitored
within the water quality monitoring programme as explained in the chapter 3.7 3.8
Water Quality.
The health monitoring programme is planned to be started during the early stage of the
project and carried out during the construction and at least to be continued for 5 years
after the project is completed.
It is proposed to consult one health expert and 2 epidemiologists for 30 days per year,
each will work 12 days per year for the collection and the assessment statistical data.
3.9.3 Requirements for Monitoring Equipment and Laboratories
The proposed health monitoring programme does not require any additional equipment
and laboratory facilities as all relevant analyses are carried out by MoH.

The health statistics will be obtained from monthly records. The epidemiologist in the
Imishli and Khachmaz district offices of the MoH will collect and appraise the district
health statistics and then send them to the health expert. The health expert will start to
assess the data in November. He will obtain the information on the microbiological
water quality of the Kura river and the SAC water from REMU's water quality
.monitoring. All the health data need to be implemented in a data base which will ease
the assessment of the time variant health situation. The data base will be installed at the
REMU.
3.9.5 Report Requirements
At the end of each annual monitoring campaign the health expert will work out a
detailed assessment of the present situation based on the actual information of the
ending campaign. This report will comprise an assessment of the water-borne, water
related health situation in the 2 monitoring areas and an assessment of the
microbiological quality of the Kura river and the SAC water.
To allow for an assessment of the development of the health situation, the report will
relate the present results to those from previous monitoring campaigns. Any negative
trends will be clearly identified in a separate chapter. This chapter would be followed by
recommendations to remedy these negative developments. The respective remedial
measures will have been co-ordinated with the Head of the REMU and with other
experts, if required.
Each annual report will state on the requirements for monitoring programme. The
necessity for the monitoring programme will be assessed annually. This will help
REMU to set-up a realistic budget for the coming campaign.
The report will be submitted to the REMU on request of REMU head. The document
will contain the assessment and all health data of the ending year. The data will be
provided to REMU in form of listings and in digital format.

3.10 SOCIO-ECONOMIc ASPECTS
The SAC and the MMMC projects both are expected to improve the existing
agricultural infrastructure of Azerbaijan. The SAC project is considered as an irrigation
project, which will improve the agricultural production and consequently improve the
economic and social well-being of the area of the project. Also the SAC project will
provide additional drinking water for Baku improving the social-welfare in the city. The
MMMC project is considered as a drainage project which will improve the melorative
conditions of the land. Consequently, the rising usage of agricultural areas will increase
in productivity. Therefore, also the MMMC project is expected to contribute to the
income level of the people and social-welfare. Both projects are assumed to affect the
socio-economic level in their implementation areas. The regular monitoring will form
the basis for a sound assessment of the project impacts to the human environment. For
the MMMC and SAC monitoring areas the proposed programs will take into
consideration the Imishli and Khachmaz districts respectively. The key indicators, the
sampling points and the monitoring schedule are arranged to achieve the maximum

information to assess the status of socio-economic situation in relation to the
agricultural sector. Finally, the budget is set up and operation-costs of the monitoring
programme are detailed.
State Statistical Committee regularly issues statistics on population, migration, etc.
Additional, there is some statistical information available from the district office of the
State Statistical Committee.
3.10.1 Key Environmental Indicators
Indicators in the MMMC and SAC monitoring areas are selected to allow the
assessment of the impacts of the new collector and rehabilitated irrigation canal on the
socio-economic conditions.
The proposed indicators in both monitoring areas are listed below:
1. Demographic factors
2. Crop productivity;
3. Livestock productivity;
4. Fraction of the incomes per capita; and
5. Fraction of the expenditures per capita.
These indicator parameters will indicate the socio-economic situation in the project
areas. Economical investments may positively and negatively effect the physical
environment but usually they influence human environment by economical means. This
contribution is need to be monitored in order to evaluate the achievements. In case of
these projects the contribution of agricultural activity to socio-economy will be carried
out according to the indicators mentioned above.
3.10.2 Monitoring Schedule
The socio-economic situation will be monitored in the Imishli district of the MMMC
monitoring area and in the Khachmaz district of the SAC monitoring area. Surveys
within the complete monitoring areas would be very inefficient and therefore sampling
indicator areas are chosen to represent the socio-economic condition in the whole
monitoring areas. (See also Chapter 2.7 2.7 Socio-Economic Aspects).
The socio-economic monitoring will be carried out in a two years interval. The actual
surveys will be carried out in both project areas during a time span of 15 days, one week
of field survey is supposed to be sufficient for each monitoring area. The surveys will
start at mid November. The monitoring programme for the socio-economy is proposed
to last at least 6 years.

It is proposed to employ one socio-economist for 30 days for the co-ordination and the
assessment of the observations. The socio-economist will be charged for 15 days to co-
ordinate the monitoring studies and another 15 days for the assessment of the surveys.
During the co-ordination period the socio-economist will conduct one day field trips to
each monitoring areas (total 2 days).
3.10.3 Requirements for Monitoring Equipment and Laboratories
It is assumed that the socio-economist will work out his report on his own computer
equipment. Therefore no additional equipment is required.
3.10.4 Regulations for Data Handling, Processing and Evaluation
Before the survey starts, specific standardised questionnaires will be prepared by the
socio-economist. The surveys will be carried out at 7 different locations of the Imishli
and Khachmaz districts. At each location 6 specialists will conduct surveys using the
standardised questionnaires. The socio-economist will assess the MMMC and SAC data
and report on the results. Thereafter he takes care that all collected data can be installed
at the REMU data base.
In addition to the project-own surveys the socio-economist will collect every two years
statistical information from State Statistical Comnmittee and its district offices. This
information will also be integrated into the REMU data base.
3.10.5 Report Requirements
At the end of each monitoring campaign the socio-economist will work out a detailed
assessment of the present situation based on the actual information.
To allow an assessment of the improvement of agricultural production and of the
economic and social situation the actual results will be related to those from previous
monitoring periods. All trends will be clearly identified in a separate chapter. If negative
developments can be identified remedial measures should be outlined. These measures
will have to be co-ordinated with the Head of the REMU and with other experts, if
deemed necessary.
Each report will state on the requirements of the socio-economic monitoring
programmne. This will help REMU to set-up a realistic budget for the coming Campaign.

will contain the assessment and all surveyed and calculated data of the ending period.
The data will be provided to REMU in form of listings and in digital format.
3.10.6 Standardised Report Forms
The reporting forms for the socio-economic aspects will be similar to the ones listed at
the Appendix (see A. 14 to A.20). These forms will be completed by the socio-economist
according to the actual survey requirements.
3.10.7 Monitoring personnel and training needs
The monitoring will be co-ordinated by the socio-economist. He is also responsible for
data management, the assessments and the reporting as well as for co-ordination of the
local field surveyors, 6 for each district.
3.10.8 Budget needs
The socio-economic monitoring programme does not require a special set-up budget.
In Table 3.24 and Table 3.25 the total operational costs for the two-yearly surveys are
shown to be $US1,260, the average annual costs are $US 630 consequently. These
amounts include the staff costs and transportation costs for the socio-economist.

4. PROPOSAL OF GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
SYSTEM (GIS) FOR REMU
4.1   GENERAL
The present chapter focuses on the application of GIS methods to support the execution
of the RIIDIA II monitoring programme. The implementation of the GIS should be
considered as optional. GIS is internationally considered as one of the main data
integration and assessment tools in environmental monitoring. As detailed below the
main investment costs will be related to training by an international expert. This expert
has a twofold function, a) to train GIS and b) to support the head of the REMU as
monitoring expert. Although considered as optional the Consultant strongly
recommends the implementation of a monitoring specific GIS. The absence of GIS does
not necessarily hinder successful monitoring, but it may provoke persistent problems in
handling and analysis of time and space relevant monitoring data.
Environmental monitoring as it is to be carried out in the framework- of the RIIDIA II
project focuses on the spatial and on the temporal development of environmental
parameters. In this framework it is of interest to find out at what distance to the
infrastructural measures specific environmental parameters are affected by the project. It
is also of interest to define the delay in time between completion of infrastructural
measures and distance related change of key parameters.
To be able to answer the above indicated questions the monitoring is to be carried out
periodically for different parameters at different locations. The gained data need to be
collected and processed and evaluated to achieve space-time related information which
then can be used for environmental decision making. With the increasing of the data
stock its processing and evaluation gains crucial importance. The application of
computerised databases therefore forrns the state of the art technique to comply with that
task.
The set-up of the monitoring programme takes into consideration the existence of two
different monitoring areas. In these areas a number of different topics is to be monitored
and assessed. Each of the topics is defined by a different number of key parameters. In
general the sampling points of these key parameters can be directly related to a specific
geographic location, e.g. the place of a soil sample, or of a water sample, etc. In
addition, each of the samples taken for a key parameter can be related also to a date. By
this an exact space-time definition is possible for each monitoring event.

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector    PROPOSAL OF GIS
For the processing, evaluation and presentation of space-related information a specific
type of computerised database is accepted world-wide. It is the Geographic Information
System (GIS) which integrates different geographic information and allows topic related
analysis and representation by means of specific GIS-methods and subsequently by the
generation of data-tables or by means of thematic maps.
4.2   TASKS OF GIS
In the framework of the monitoring programme a Geographic Information System will
be formed and set-up to enable an appropriate integration of attributive and geographic
data related to the different project specific monitoring parameters. The GIS will assist
the REMU to process and analyse the monitoring data and results that are to be collected
and delivered by the external Consultants as attributive data and maps, in digital form
and on paper (maps). The GIS should be installed at the REMU within the SAIC. All
data collected by the external Consultants will be processed and stored by the REMU in
the GIS as far as applicable. Other data, e.g. hydrological time series data will be stored
in their own appropriate manner. The GIS will also assist the extemal Consultants in
their evaluation and assessment of the data. In accordance with the actual monitoring
needs the GIS tasks may also include the following:
System set-up
* Identification of information needs
* Definition of data models
* Elaboration of database structure
* Purchase and set-up of software and hardware
Data acquisition
* Capturing of attribute data from external digital sources
* Capturing of graphical data from external digital sources
* Digitising of maps
* Generation and validation of vector information
* Geo-referencing of vector information
* Import of Raster data (e.g. satellite images or scanned map data)
* Geo-referencing of raster information
* Integration of attributive and geographic data
* Topological revision of vector information
* Attaching of attribute information to vector objects
Image processing
* Contrast enhancement of satellite images
* Classification of satellite data
* Support of land use classification
* Support of physiographic and morphological classification

*  Preparation of database reports
The sustainable operation of an envirorunental GIS requires personnel with special
expertise and training. Therefore it is suggested to form a GIS group within the REMU.
This group should provide the required expertise. The personal set-up and the general
outline of the tasks of the mentioned GIS group is outlined in the following paragraph.
4.3   COMPOSITION AND TASKS OF GIS-GROUP
It is supposed to form a GIS working group within the REMU to carry out the
previously defined GIS tasks. This REMU-GIS group should be responsible to the head
of the Unit. The group should be formed of at least three members, comprising one GIS-
and database expert and two operators, assisting him in data capturing, database work
and map-making.
The obligation of the GIS group is to support the REMU in performing its duties
concerning data acquisition, data integration and processing and data evaluation. In
addition the group members are responsible for the generation of database related data
reports and of GIS based cartographic materials. The above mentioned GIS tasks will
also be carried out by them as required by the Head of the REMU.
The REMU-GIS group should be operational only during those periods, when the
REMU is operational also. In order not to loose their skills it is suggested, that the
REMU-GIS group and their equipment is assigned to other SAIC projects during the
rest of the year. For these times of the year extra budget resources need to be identified
by SAIC for the operation of the REMU-GIS. For the REMU-GIS related budget
finding it was assumed that the GIS group would be occupied with REMS work
approximately 3 months per year.
The training requirement for the REMU-GIS is presented in the following paragraph.
4.4   GIS TRAINING REQUIREMENTS
Environmental GIS is considered to comprise ambitious methods of database
organisation and analysis. It is set up to integrate different types of graphical
(geographic) and attribute information from environmental parameters. The handling of

Environmental Assessment and Monitoring in the Project Area
of the Samur Apsheron Canal and the Main Mill Mugan Collector    PROPOSAL OF GIS
such systems requires certain skills that differ considerably from standard office
applications as they are applied in modem data processing.
The skills required to operate the envisaged environmental GIS comprise basic
knowledge from the fields of geomatics, database organisation, geography and
cartography. However, it also requires special skills in the practical operation of the
project specific system, comprising its set-up, its modification and its useful application.
.From the above mentioned it is deemed necessary to provide special training to the
suggested GIS-group. From previous experience of the Consultant a training on the job
is offering the most promising approach to successful staff training. Therefore it is
suggested to run a respective training for the duration of one full monitoring campaign,
i.e. of three month. During this time an intemational GIS expert shall set-up the GIS-
Group together with the Head of the REMU. After that the group shall be enabled to
carry out all tasks required for the successful operation of the environmental GIS. These
works will be defined together with the Head of the REMU.
The REMU GIS specialist should offer professional background (e.g. from the fields of
agriculture/irrigation engineering or geography) and sound experience in database
management and mapping/cartography. This expert should also have good working
knowledge of English language. The two operators/draftsmen should be familiar with
cartographic work, in addition they should be capable to carry out computer assisted
data capturing, e.g. digitising works and data typing. If time allows the international
GIS-specialist will also assist the Head of the REMU in carrying out the first monitoring
campaign.
The following Table 4.1 details the budget requirements for a 3 months training on the
job carried out by one international expert for 3 national experts.
4.5   GIS HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
The REMU GIS-group should be fully furnished with its own hardware and software to
accomplish with the above outlined tasks. The hardware should principally comprise
PC-suitable standard equipment. This hardware is considered to carry the GIS software
and the related databases.
It is recommended to consider a commercially available open GIS system that offers
high performance for vector and raster processes including image processing, at an
economic price. The GIS software should generally be platform independent and run on
a Standard PC-platform like WINDOWS 95/98. The proposed GIS should offer the
possibility of regular software updates. It is not recommended to install any system, that
requires important features to be additionally programmed or acquired during the course
of the project.

During the preparation of the project the Consultant worked with the GIS software
TNTMIPS of MicroImages, Nebraska, USA. This package easily allows the integration
and classification of LANDSAT TM data and it provides full CAD and VECTOR
capabilities, fully relational database facilities and numerous import/export tools for
VECTOR, CAD and RASTER objects. A so call viewer version of TNTMips was
installed on a PC-Computer at the AZGHIPROVDKHOZ Institute, Baku. This
installation offers access to the 1987 and 1998 satellite images.
All hardware components should be purchased on the national market as far as available
at international prices. The GIS software is suggested to be purchased on the
intemational market. For printing an A3-colour printer is considered suitable. However
if additional demand for E-format colour printing should arise, the hardware budget
needs to be increased by additional $US3,000.- to purchase e.g. a HP-DesignJet 450C
including stand, etc.
The budget requirement for the set-up of the GIS equipment are detailed in Table 4.2.
The shown hardware prices are understood as actual net prices as surveyed in Germany
in August 1999. The German prices are considered to well represent the international
level.

5. OVERALL MONITORING BUDGET NEEDS
.To set-up and initiate the REMU an overall cost estimation is carried out tentatively in
the following chapter. The figures used in this chapter have been elaborated previously
in the relevant chapters. All costings take into consideration staff costs (gross) that were
discussed and agreed upon with the SAIC. However, it should be noted that changes in
the staff budgets may have considerable consequences on the overall budget.
The cost calculation covers two different altematives for set-up and operation of the
REMU. The first alternative includes a GIS Group, incl. equipment and its operation
costs whereas the second does not consider GIS. In case of the first alternative the set-up
costs and average annual operation costs are $US97,919 and $US26,393, respectively.
In the second case the set-up costs are $US86,084, the average annual operation costs
are $US25,393. In comparison to the GIS solution the non-GIS alternative is only
$US1 1,835 cheaper in set-up and $US1,000 in operation. With respect to these
insignificant cost savings the Consultant recommends to include an equipped GIS
Group into the REMU. Hereby REMU and SAIC will have the chance to introduce a
modem monitoring system with efficient database and data handling techniques.
All staff budgets are understood as gross costs. The monthly rates for consulted experts
were discussed intensively with the client. Accordingly basic monthly rates of $US300,-
were applied. The rate for proposed REMU staff were also agreed upon with the client,
consequently $US250,- were applied for the head, $US200,- for data processing
specialists and $US50,- for regional sub-unit representatives. All equipment is
understood as net, not including taxes, transport or customs.
5.1   OVERALL BUDGET NEEDS FOR SET-UP
To set-up REMU (GIS option) a budget of $US97,919 is estimated, this would include
monitoring investment co'ts for hydrology, geohydrology, climate; for soil and land use
survey monitoring programme; for water quality monitoring programme; for natural
parks and biodiversity monitoring programme and for the optional REMU-GIS. (See
Table 5.1).

Without GIS the budget requirements of REMU (non-GIS option) would be slightly
lower at $US86,084. In the latter case 3 months of international expert is proposed to be
occupied for the initiation of the monitoring programme with a monthly rate of $US
15,500, plus travel expenditures, etc. (See Table 5.2) The high investment costs for the
soil and land use monitoring are related to the purchase of 3 Landsat satellite images.
The purchase of these images is expected to be carried out during year 6 of the
monitoring programme.

5.2   ANNUAL BUDGET NEEDS FOR OPERATION OF MONITORING SYSTEM
The annual operation costs used in chapter 3 are annual averages. The total average
annual costs of the monitoring, in the first case REMU (GIS option) would be $US
26,393 (See Table 5.3). In the second case total annual costs of REMU (non-GIS option)
become $US 25,393 (see Table 5.4).
For the non-GIS option Table 5.4 shows REMU operation costs that are almost 30%
higher than those of the with-GIS version. This is caused by the additional data base
expert (3x350$US/mm), one additional operator (3x10I$US/mm), one additional soil
expert (see chapter 3.6.8 ), and additional hardware replacement costs ($US1,910).
These additionally required experts are already included in the with-GIS budget.

97,919            131,965            229,884
During the following years only $US26,393 are necessary for operation per year. All
costs should be financed by GoA and IDA. Respective cost sharing should be negotiated
among the parties, taking into account that GoA funds are very scare.
Further funds for the period after RIIDIA implementation may be financed partially by
IDA under an Irrigation II - Project. It is recommended to Transfer REMU and its
obligations to MoE (ASCE) after the five years RIIDIA implementation period.

adj. SAR means adjusted Sodium Adsorption Ratio can be calculated using the procedure
given in Table.3
Values presented are for the dominant type clay mineral in the soil since structural stability varies
between the various clay types (Rallings, 1996, and RHoades, 1975). Problems are less likely
to develop if water salinity is high: more likely to develop if water salinity is low.
Use the lower range if ECw < 0.4 mmhoslcm:
Use the intermediate range if ECw = 0.4-1.6 mmhos/cm:
Use the upper limit if ECw > 1.6 mmhoslcm:
Most tree crops and woody ornamentals are sensitive to sodium and chloride (use values shown).
Most annual crops are not sensitive (use the salinity toleranse tables [Table 5])
With sprinkler irrigation on sensitive crops, sodium or chloride in excess of 3 meqA under certain
conditions has resulted in excessive leaf absorbtion and crop damage.

Notes:
1 The two parameters to which fish are more sensitive are temperature and dissolved oxygen
Oxygen is less soluble in water at hihger temperatures. Also more non-ionised ammonia,
which is toxic to fish, moves into solution from NH," as the temperature rises as well as
an increase in pH. the higher the ambient temperature, the closer fish are living to their
upper tolerance limit and the less able they are to tolerate changes to their environment.
Organic pollution will reduce the dissolved oxygen content of the water.
2 A wide range of heavy metals, industrial pollutants and agrochemicals are toxic to fish.

reports.
Many problems, essence which one, basically preset to the participants of a seminar,
was reduced to following:
.    The poor activity of a collector-drainage system in Khachmaz region is negatively
mirrored in a condition of dabbled grounds. Whether the renovation of an intraeconomic
drainage system is stipulated by the project?
How much water will move in cities of Baku and Sumgait on the potable purposes from
Jeyranbatan reservoir after rehabilitation of SAC.
There are large losses of water on a filtration from earthen channels. Whether the
concreting of these channels is stipulated by the project?
How the clearing of water of detrital deposits is envisioned?
How will be solved the problem water deliverys for a spraying during renovation SAC?

Quite often in SAC fall and the people and livestock perish. Whether any measures for
an avoidance it are envisioned?
tHow will be solved the problem compensation of grounds falling under a line of building
of a Khanarkh charnel?
On all problems the in-depth answers and explanations were given.
Essentially the resume of comments are the followings:
Taking into account that SAC is existing canal system and construction-repairing works
will be carried out of Headwork and 50 km canal part, the environmental impacts said activities
should be minimized as possible. It was suggested to install fish screen structures in the rivers
intended water intake for SAC in future. It was also pointed out importance of river water from
sediment.
Generally participants indicated importance of project implementation which will
improve water supply of irrigated land on project zone.
Participants also expressed their satisfaction that this project takes into account the
environmental points in wide scale.
