MEMORANDUM AND RECONMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIm DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR A NATIONAL MINOR IRRIGATION DEVmLOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following Memorandum and Recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for SDR 38.1 million (US$54.0
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be
on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years. It would help finance the
National Minor Irrigation Development Project (NMIDP). The European Economic
Community (EEC) will provide ECU6S.0 million (US$88.0 million equivalent) of
co-financing in the form of a grant to finance the project's technical
assistance needs and part of the other project components.
2.       Backsground.  With a per capita income of US$170, Bangladesh remains
one the poorest countries of the world. Over 702 of its population of 110
million continues to live in conditions of absolute 3overty. Agriculture
accounts for about one half of GDP and about 601 of employment and exports.
Agricultural growth during the second half of the 1980s averaged about 1.71
compared with about 3S during the first half of the 1980s. This was due to a
slowdown in irrigation development, exceptional floods in 1987 and 1988, and a
sharp cutback in development expenditures for agriculture and water resources.
Irrigation has played a central role in supporting productivity growth in
agriculture. About two thirds of the increase in the production of foodgrains
in the last decade came from irrigated dry season cropping. Reliable
irrigation typically increases land productivitr by over 752. Irrigation has
been extended over the past 15 years by about 100,000 ha per year. However,
IDA analysis indicates that an annual increase of about 250,000 ha will be
required to sustain a 4X-St annual increase in foodgrain production. Such a
rate of development is Indeed feasible as the potential exists to more than
double the present irrigated area of about 2.5 million ha using relatively
*       inexpensive minor irrigation technologies (costing US$200-US$800 per ha) to
exploit readily available ground and surface water resources.
3.       Substantial sector work undertaken over the past two years has
produced a consensus among the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) and major donors
on the key elements of a strategy to support acceleration of minor irrigation
development. These includes removing restrictions on private sector
participation and Investment in trade and distribution of agricultural inputs.
strengthening the rural credit system, upgrading support services, and
improving the allocation and utilisation of public funds. IDA's immediate
support for this strategy will be channeled through four interrelated leading
operations to be undertaken jointly with other major donors. These are:
(i) the proposed project described in this memorandum, which will mainly
support investments in deep tubewells (DTWs), a relatively complex technology
requiring strong technical assistance in the initial years of introduction
into the private sector; (ii) a Shallow Tubevell (STW) and Low Lift Pump (LLP)
Irrigation Project, which will help sustain private sector investments in
simple technologies (STVs, LLPs and power tillers) not requiring public sector
supports (iii) an Agricultural and Rural Credit Project, which will provide
Institutional credit for a wide range of agricultural investments including a
small share of minor irrigation equipmemt (about 10S based on past



- 2 -
experience); and (iv) an Agricultural Support Services Project, 'which will
help create a capability for effective extension in support of improved on-
farm water management and intensification of the farming system.
4.       IDA has supported 12 irrigation projects in Bangladesh, of which four
are ongoing, inc'luding the Deep Tubewells (DTVs) II Project (Cr. 1287-B.)
which finances investments in DTWs. Major lessons learned from past projects
relate to the need for: (i) enhancing the role of farmers and private sector
suppliers in the selection and management of DTW equipment, and (ii) improving
institutional arrangements for minor irrigation development.  Farmer have had
limited access to highly subsidized force mode pumping equipment and limited
input in selecting the types of equipment most appropriate to their
circumstances. Large subsidies favoring complex and costly DTWs have
particularly discouraged the int.oduction of more cost effective, affordable,
and manageable technologies. Moreover, the subsidy prevented private sector
participation and investment in the supply of DTWs. Under these
circumstances, the implementation capacity of the public monopo'y, the
Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC), has acted as a binding
constraint on expanding access to force mode pumping equipment. The lesson
learnt is that farmers should have the final say in the composition of the
package of equipment components based on cost considerations, their
ability/willingness to organize in groups, and their desire to borrow to
finance such equipment. For that, farmers require primarily technical and
market information from the public sector, rather than a limited supply of
highly subsidized equipment. Subsidies should be eliminated both to spur
increased private sector research and development and marketing activity and
to broaden the range of technologies available to farmers.
5.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The country's agricultural
development strategy recognizes that the key to satisfactory growth in the
agricultural sector in the 19909 is the sustained development of minor
irrigation at a substantially higher rate than in the recent past. This
irrigation-led strategy is viable because of the relatively low cost of the
facilities and because investments in this type of irrigation have proved
affordable and profitable to farmers under the present levels of knowledge
and management. IDA has worked closely with GOB to formulate and Introduce
several policy initiatives aimed at liberalizing the trade, distribution, and
siting of minor irrigation equipment and at encouraging the introduction and
development of cost-effective itrigation technologies. The experience IDA has
gained over the years in the context of this policy dialogue and through past
projects In support of minor irrigation gives it a comparative advantage among
donors in providing effective support to GOB in implementing this project.
Also, as noted above, the proposed project is an integral part of a package of
four projects designed to address key constraints in the agricultural sector.
6.       Project Objectives. The project's primary objective is to promote
growth in agriculture through increased private sector investment in minor
irrigation. This will be achieved through: (a) providing wider and more
equitable access to minor irrigation through the introduction of smaller
capacity irrigation equipment to meet area-specific needs and to make
irrigation more accessible to small farmers; (b) liberalizing trade and
distribution of irrigation equipment including* (i) eliminating the 702
subsidy on 56 1/sec DTWs, (ii) equalizing duties and taxes on imported
equipment between public and private entities, (Wi) eliminating
standardization requirements on all types and capacities of equipment,



(iv) public sector pricing which reflects the full cost of their operations,
and (v) eventual phasing out of direct public sector involvement; (c)
adJusting BADC's institutional capability in line with its changing rolet Cd)
extending DTW ownership to associations other than village-based cooperatives,
and to private individuals; and (e) introducing a consistent approach to
public sector support for minor irrigation development, regardless of the
source of funding.
6.     Project Description.  The project, to be implemented over a seven-year
period, will support irrigation development on some 265,000 ha through
financing: (a) the procurement and installation of force mode pumping
equipment (DTWs) with capacities meeting farmers' demand; Cb) the
rehabilitation of about 1,800 existing BADC-owned 56 l/sec DTWs being
privatized under the project; (c) the Improvement of existing drainage
channels; and Cd) the procurement and installation of pontoon-mounted pumps.
The project will also finances (a) demonstration irrigation systems covering
about 500 DTW and LLP schemes serving about 10,000 hat (b) capacity-building
technical assistance in such areas as ti) environment protection, (Ii)
training and information dissemination, and Ciii) institutional restructuring
of BADC, which would be designed to change its role from input supply to
private sector support; and tc) technical assistance for project
implementation support. The Ministry of Agriculture will have overall
responsibility for project implementation and monitoring. The total cost is
estimated at US$171.1 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
US$86.3 million (50.4?). A breakdown of costs and financing are shown In
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Bangladesh are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively.  Two mapa, IBiD No. 22422 and IBID
No. 22641, are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8824-3D, dated
April 26, 1991, is being distributed separately.
7.     Agreed Actions.  Agreements have been reached at negotiations that GOB
wills (a) not subsidize the sale of new DTW equipment and pontoon-mounted
pumps (subsidies on BADC's existing stock of 56 l/sec DTWs will be phased out
in accordance with an agreed timetable, starting June 30, 1991)g (b) ensure
that (i) private and public sector sellers of DTVs and pontoon-mounted pumps
have the same tax treatment, similar trade regime, and equal access to project
funds (eligibility criteria for access to project funds have been agreed
upon), and (i1) set public sector prices for irrigation equipment at full
cost, including taxes and overhead costss (c) require BADC to sell all its
operational DTWV -- which it is presently renting -- and to write off the non-
operational wells; (d) ensure that BADC complete Its institutional
reorientation, including redeployment of all redundant staff by March 31,
1994; (e) take by December 31, 1991 all steps necessary to enable farmer
groups to acquire legal personality with appropriate powers and functions; and
(f) ensure that BADC will not become an owner or operator of pontoon-mounted
pumps. Conditions of effectiveness for the IDA credit will be: (a) execution
of the co-financing agreement between GOB and EEC; (b) approval of the Project
Proforma by GOB; (c) appointment by the Ministry of Agriculture of a qualified
project director; (d) execution of a satisfactory agreement between GOB and
Bangladesh Bank for administering the financing facility available to BADC and
the private sectors and (e) GOB setting the import duty on DTV components and
spare parts at about 151 for both the public and the private sector.
Disbursement of IDA funds against project expenditures incurred by BADC, will



- 4 -
be conditional ons (a) revision of BADC's business orientation and focus to
deemphasize its role in commercial activitiest (b) completion of an analysis
of BADC's skill requirements; (c) adoption of a satisfactory retirement plan
for BADC's mechanics servicing irrigation equipment; and (d) appointment of
key staff required by BADC for project implementation.
8.     Project Benefits.  Project benefits will result from the provision of
irrigation to about 275,000 ha providing the primary basis of livelihood to
about 314,000 families. The project vould make a significant contribution to
private sector development, and is expected to have an overall positive
environmental impact. The project's direct Impact in terms of increased
agricultural production and employment generated at full development includes,
(a) an incremental production in the order of 817,000 metric tons of
foodgrainlyear; and (b) an increase in farm employment in the order of 31
million work days per year. Annual per capita income will rise from about
US$43 to about US$108 for the farm families benefitting from the project. The
economic rate of return of the project is estimated at 481. The project has
explicitly been designed to create conditions for groups of smalIholder and
even landless farmers to pool resources to purchase and operate irrigation
facilities. Moreover, the faster pace of irrigation development and increased
density of irrigation facilities supported by policy and institutional reforms
will contribute to the development of more competitive water markets. This
will provide opportunities for a greater number of poor farmers who cannot
afford the capital costs of DTWs to gain access to modern agricultural
technologies via the purchase of irrigation water from owners of equipment.
9.    Risks. The main risks are those inherent in the transition from a
public sector dominated, supply-driven marketing and distribution system to
one that is demand driven and private sector led. These risks are that
private sector participation and investment, and farmers' effective demand for
market priced irrigation equipment will be less than anticipated. On the
supply side, private sector participation will be facilitated by the policy
and procedural reforms contained in the project with respect to eliminating
public subsidies, and equalization of trade and tax treatment as well as of
access to project funds between the public and private sector. on the demand
side, farmers' participation and investment will be stimulated by removing
geographically based quotas, allowing freedom of choice in selecting
capacities, components, and brands of equipment, and the project's support
services to organize smallholder and landless farmers into water user groups.
Recent analysis indicates that financial returns to investment in minor
irrigation are substantial and that farmers in a wide range of circumstances
have the capacity to pay for such investments.
11.    Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit vould comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recoxmend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
